>

>Before we get into what we've been working on, let's address what many of you want to know: public testing will begin in a matter of days. We hoped to start some time ago, but we've been making changes to how some important things work, because we saw a better way to tackle some of the more complex role features. We're currently fixing a few things from the last round of insider testing we did a few days ago, and then we'll go to the Steam testing branch.

>

>The past month we moved past testing core role functionality and we've been trying our hand at some actually complex role based behaviours. So far all AI decisions have been driven by an emotion system, with roles only really being able to nudge things in a direction and provide some specific interactions and reactions. That didn't really allow for more rational behaviour, and often creates a harsh disconnect between how a character acts and what interactions they can engage in. We've been working on a much tighter integration between roles and emotions, allowing roles to both influence emotions more directly and to make explicit and considered decisions based on emotions and low level behaviour. You could basically see this as making the difference between a wild animal and a thinking, rational human.

>

>We had developed the core features for this already, but when it came to actually using them we realised there was a better, but fundamentally different approach. This has quite an impact on core AI and places a much bigger emphasis on roles for low level behaviour, so things will need to be tweaked and adjusted over time, but has many advantages. This leads into what we previously discussed as ""foundational behaviour roles"". They provide the most important emergent behaviours and relationships based on unscripted events and actions. We're again using Derrin as a test case, where he could previously only be provoked into combat without this being reflected in subsequent behaviour or dialogue, he can now respond in various ways, choosing to plead for mercy, run away and try his luck on his own or negotiating a truce with the player. He will respond differently to intimidation or outright hostility, or hold grudges and so on.  
  
A big part of this is also making dialogue more dynamic and situationally appropriate. Where game dialogue is typically something that happens separately from the rest of the game, in Exanima dialogue can be conducted while doing anything else and while everything continues to happen normally. It's entirely possible to attack someone at any point during a friendly conversation for example, or for it to be interrupted, or simply be or become inappropriate in an emerging situation or emotional state. This creates a lot of very difficult problems with many cases that are not easy to predict or account for. As well as building contextual awareness into the dialogue system and dynamic reactions, there is the problem of dialogue being interrupted and resumed naturally, possibly taking a new direction based on what happened.

>

>We've added various new dialogue and re-written most of the existing dialogue. Besides just improving some of the hastily written old stuff, we've tried to make dialogue feel like a natural back and forth between characters, in keeping with its real time aspect. This however means that dialogue branches often and quickly explodes into a large volume even for short conversations. This is made much more complex still by the previously mentioned contextual changes, dynamic elements and resuming interrupted conversations. Our systems and tools were designed for this, but it's our first time navigating these complex cases and we're still figuring out the best ways to author and handle all this as we go.

>

>We've also been making unique events and interactions more generalised and versatile, so that they can work with many roles. This means characters might respond differently to these based on their roles or that characters can easily be substituted for others. One example of how this would be used is for Derrin (and other characters) to appear on playthroughs other than Unknown's, providing an opportunity for different lore exposition and a more meaningful alternate playthrough. On that note, we're also finally working on introducing the proctor uniform and armour set. This is an elaborate and very unique set with eleven pieces that can be combined in different ways.

>  
After a first round of improvements to pathfinding went through testing, we worked on it a fair bit more. We solved some remaining issues and made characters better at navigating complex paths, far less prone to getting stuck and they now try to find a safe and comfortable position to stop in. There's still some pathfinding related improvements and tweaks we'd like to make such as characters moving better in groups, moving out of each other's way and dodging moving objects, but for now the focus was mainly on making companions better at avoiding dangers and sticking with the player. While role testing and general polishing continues, we're still finalising new content, but also working on a few things besides. We're not sure exactly what other features we will include in the main update just yet, but as we've overcome these big development hurdles we're shifting focus to completing and adding new features and smaller content additions. Some of these will come in small updates following the big one.

It starts off with pineapple, then comes along more pineapple, and then some more pineapple, and then the dry down smells a lot like pineapples, but this time mixed with body odor. 

I genuinely did not get the hype behind this absolute body odor of a fragrance

Overall: 0/10
Performance: 8-9/10

Afnan Supremacy Collector’s Edition:

Ok so this one opens up as pineapple as well but its not just pineapple, you get citruses with it as well and it shines the most in its dry down, you get woody ambery mixed with oakmass and in a very good way

Overall: 6/10, its a good scent just not for me.
Performance: 8/10

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa:

This one opens up like coffee mixed with cinnamon and other spices, then drys down into a sweet gourmand praline vanilla fragrance. 

In my opinion you could rock it not just in winter but say in summer you’re going to a nice place for dinner where you know its gonna be air conditioned, you could definitely rock it.

Overall: 7/10, a good fragrance just not for me, i personally prefer the normal khamrah over this

Performance: 9/10( actually lasts and projects)

I can’t wait to get started with the July installment of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes.” But let me take some time to quickly look at the June 20th World Tribune.

First comes an account of the Central Executive Conference: [10,000 Youth: At the Central Executive Committee Conference, a bold new focus is set toward January 2028](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/99923/) that outlines the steps the SGI-USA is taking toward January 2, 2028.

Next, I want to point out the [touching experience](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/99921/) of a member from La Mesa, CA, who walks us through his retirement after 50 years in the Navy, the passing of his wife Michiko, his steps in facing his grief, and the slow but steady development of his faith.

But let me park here, [Living With an Awareness of the Importance of the Heart](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/99892/), a reprint of a speech Daisaku Ikeda gave in 1988. It speaks very deeply to me. He talks about “the ultimate message of Nichiren Daishonin’s writings.” It boils down to two points:

>The first essential message is to base ourselves on the Gohonzon. It is to make the foundation of our faith “only Nam-myoho-renge-kyo” (WND-1, p. 903)—that is, to sincerely chant and practice the Mystic Law alone. 

>The second essential message is that “it is the heart that is important” (WND-1, 1000). These two points… are the crucial cornerstones of the Daishonin’s writings. 

Why is the second one so important?

>Faith is not just a matter of embracing the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo but also a matter of our hearts, or the attitude with which we practice. Are our hearts directed toward kosen-rufu? The innermost heart, the attitude in the depths of our beings, determines everything.

Sidebar: maybe this is why some of the posters at r/sgiwhistleblowers claim they didn’t receive what they sought from their prayers. Many of the posts exude ugliness, jealousy, and dehumanization. As I shall explain in a bit, I observe those qualities in myself. My human revolution lies in fighting against those tendencies. But if a member is unwilling to make those efforts, how can their prayers be realized?

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>Whether we become happy, attain enlightenment, move in the direction of Buddhahood or wind up in a state of suffering—everything is the exact result of the wondrous workings of our hearts or minds. This point cannot be overemphasized.

How am I doing on this matrix? As I mentioned above, today we are cutting the ribbon to the new Dewey House. The Twinettes are so excited! Because of my sordid past, I’ve decided it is best to distance myself from the daily operations of the Longhouse Schools. But I support logistically to the very best of my abilities. And now it’s time to order furniture, equipment, and supplies for the extension and our new First and Second Grade classrooms. This Artie and I will do with all of the love in our hearts for the children and the school’s mission.

In my bachelor’s program, I had chartered a concentration of study to lead toward counseling. But with the course I am taking now, I am seeing that I don’t deal well with all of the abstraction and theory. I am barely keeping up with my classemates and professor. My therapist believes that maybe my long history of substance abuse has damaged brain functioning. It’s up to me, he said, but maybe I should consider moving back toward Accounting. I think he is right and so I shall. A bit of honest reflection: one door slams shut, another opens. Two points for the home team. Julie CPA, here I come!

But now Daisaku Ikeda takes another direction:

>Selfishness, complaint, doubt, deviousness, conceit, arrogance and so forth are all causes of unhappiness for both ourselves and others. When we allow ourselves to be ruled by such negative attitudes, we are like a plane that has lost its direction in a heavy fog. We can see nothing clearly. The distinction between good and bad, right and wrong, becomes blurred. 

>We plunge not only ourselves but our passengers—our friends and others around us—into misery. When afflicted by arrogance, our minds run amok, like a crazed horse galloping wildly in circles, unable to stop, until we lose all self-awareness and do harm to those around us. This is not a normal human state.

How much my partners love and support me when I go through all of my highs and lows, extreme needs, and unpredictability. I have always looked at this condition as the depth or center of my life—and do my best to accommodate and win over them. But maybe I give far too much attention to my “selfishness, complaint, doubt, deviousness, conceit, arrogance and so forth” thereby empowering them!

Instead I need to walk up a flight of stairs and bet my life on a different algorithm. And here is where I found my answer:

>In contrast, a sincere concern for others, a dedicated commitment to our beliefs, a sense of responsibility toward fulfilling our mission for kosen-rufu, a wish to wholeheartedly encourage and support our fellow members, a feeling of appreciation, gratitude and joy—these attitudes are causes that will produce boundless good fortune, not only for ourselves but also for our family and loved ones as well as our descendants. 

>They give rise to strong protection by the heavenly deities—the positive forces of the universe—and enable us to advance directly along the path to attaining Buddhahood. 

Seriously, I can do this! No big deal!

To conclude, Daisaku Ikeda advises:

>Let us therefore live with the Daishonin’s words “It is the heart that is important” engraved deeply and indelibly in our lives.

From the standpoint of this guidance, Eulogio’s differences are immaterial. He grasps and lives by “It is the heart that is important” and thereby cuts ribbons, moves the universe—and figures out how to cut the costs of physical education at the Longhouse Elem in roughly half!

**Ursula Lindberg, employee of the Federnet Research Agency, Earth, Human-Arxur Republic, New Terran Calendar 14-Huitzilopochtli-36 (Old Human Calendar: 20 October 2048)**



In the course of the last month, I started settling into the office routine: see the daily list of targets, compile a profile, raise and repeat. I must be getting good at it, because slowly but surely Diego and Alkimos have let me do my first actions: plant a meme here, start a gossip there, monitor the reactions and then inflame them. Watching the feds in their little social networks feels like observing an anthill, while a magnifying glass is slowly raising the temperature.

All in all, for a place with such a secretive nature, the job itself was incredibly mundane at times. So when our team leader, Lan, passed by the break room to ask us to come to her office when we finished our coffee, we were somewhere between excited and slightly worried.

And that’s why I am here waiting for her to get back to her office, while Neo stares us down from the poster on the wall.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, something came up.” She then pauses, smiles slightly and continues: “I guess you were wondering why I asked you to come. So, the Director was positively impressed with this team’s work on the Cradle and, with the upcoming regional elections, wanted to give you a delicate job.”

“He wants us to shake the water a bit and make the electorate a bit more frightful than usual?” tries Diego.

“Actually no, another team will deal with that. You are going to make sure that Sippit, one of the candidates for the Southern Orchard region, wins the election. Post or hype feel-good stories about it, squash all bad press, find and spread rumours about its opponent…and if you can’t find anything, create a scandal”. After a quick sip from a glass of water, she continues: “Now I can’t stress enough how delicate and surgical this needs to be. Our fingerprints or pawprints can’t be seen anywhere, ok?”

We all nod and she continues: “And one last warning: if you notice any allegations, no matter how tiny, about it being a Black Star or alleging some connection to us, you contact me immediately, ok?” After a long look at us that clearly means don’t screw this up guys, she concludes by asking if we have any questions or doubts. Alkimos then inquires if we are going to receive a full report on Sippit and the general situation in the area. She tells him that they are already included in the assignment folders, and if we need further intel, to submit a request to her.

Since none of us has other questions, she dismisses us and we return to our office. The next few hours move quickly between consulting the files, familiarising with the area, and elaborating a strategy for the campaign. We don’t have a lot of profiles targeted to that area, so in the next few weeks, we will have to work overtime to make new ones that can withstand scrutiny.

It’s already dark when we decide to call it a day. A soft snow is falling. I look at Alkimos and I smile with tenderness when I notice him raising his maw to the sky to feel the snow on his fur. We walk slowly on the quiet roads. He tells me about how much he misses Esquo’s arctic beauty, and I tell him about my childhood games in the snow back in Iceland. I’m pretty fond of him, but I’m not sure if it’s the same for him. Maybe what I think is intimacy is just a cultural difference. After all, we belong to different species. Maybe he just wants a friend in a difficult time in a strange new world.

We are already in front of the Arxur broth bar where we are supposed to see Victoria and Aspis, when Alkimos stops in front of a lamppost and rises, standing on his back paws. Looking at me with his huge eyes, he begins shyly: “Ursula, for these last two months I really appreciated the time we’ve spent together, and I can only admire your intelligence and kindness. And… and I will totally understand if you don’t feel the same, and I will never make it awkward for you. But I… I…” I interrupt his stammering, getting closer to him and rising to the tip of my toes to reach his height.

And for a moment, in this sad, angry galaxy, there is only us, the snow softly covering our heads and his tail slowly caressing my back.



**Victoria Vella Silva, student, Earth, Human-Arxur Republic, New Terran Calendar 14-Huitzilopochtli-36 (Old Human Calendar: 20 October 2048)**

The broth bar is in an old 19th-century building, right next to the Arxur Students Association. I pass through the wooden door, with its beautiful snake-shaped handle, and it takes a moment for my eyes to adjust to the dim interior. The floor is covered in red, yellow, and gold tiles forming complex geometric patterns. On one side of the room there’s an old-timey human bar counter; on the other, a series of widely spaced booths where patrons quietly prepare and sip their broth. The walls are decorated with photos of Wriss and Earth, hunting trophies, swords, and ancient verses by pre-Dominion poets.

I ask for Aspis at the counter and am told to go upstairs to room number four. I take a spiral staircase, its old steps covered by a soft red carpet to protect them from claw marks, and find myself in a corridor just barely lit—enough to keep us humans from bumping into furniture.

Before entering the room marked with a four in Wrissan numerals, I catch a glimpse of the room next to it, whose door is slightly ajar. It’s a sand room. I’ve never seen one outside Wriss or the Capital. A place where an Arxur can meditate by drawing complex patterns in warm sand. It’s absurd how many traditions barely survived the Dominion—preserved only through quiet family customs and a handful of surviving books.

After this brief moment of wonder, I enter the room reserved for us. It’s semi-circular, with a large table at the center and soft night light streaming in through a wide window on the far wall. The floor is covered in a mosaic of red, yellow, and gold tiles. It takes me a moment to realize it's meant to represent a sandstorm in one of Wriss’ southern deserts. It must be even more impressive to an Arxur—after all, they can see more shades of red than we do.Aspis greets me with a quiet bow and hands me a basket filled with tiny packets. After a moment of hesitation, I choose a Syasara broth and pass it to him without a word.

“I would have thought you’d go for something fancier,” he says, amused.

“I’m not always that posh. And besides, it’s perfect for a quiet evening.”

He silently opens the packet and pours it into the cauldron gently bubbling on the warm plate at the center of the table, adding a few spices with practiced movements.After a moment of peaceful silence, he looks at me and says, “Since the others aren’t here yet, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask. Could you get me a pass to visit the Capital? I’d love to see the mosaics in the upper gallery.”I sigh quietly. I hate these kinds of requests.“You know I can’t. The Capital and its location are a closely guarded secret for a reason. In case of war, it’ll be the leaf-leackers first target. Besides, I’m sure you visited the Kedros ones that inspired the Arxur part and, as for the human part, if you want to see [byzantine mosaics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30x-iC3c5DA) you can just take a two-hour train ride”.

“Well, I tried. I guess I’m envious of my cousin. He is an old tooth, but a the same time he can’t stop bragging that he saw the capital”,

“The type of old Dominion fan that would never put himself on a diet or renounce electricity to follow his ideals?”

“Precisely”. After a brief pause, he adds: “So there is absolutely no chance?” with what I can only describe as the closest imitation an Arxur can pull of puppy eyes.

*Oh for goddess's sake. If this is how he wants to play…beware of what you wish Aspis.* “I guess that the next time I’m forced to go to the capital for some ceremony, I could add you as a plus one. But it’s going to be extremely boring, not to mention socially exhausting for an Arxur. And this without considering the security checks…”

Despite my best attempt to scare him away from the idea, his maw lights up like a Christmas tree. “Thank you. Thank you. And I promise I can endure anything and everything”.

*Well, I warned you.* I gesture to him for a cup of broth and we sip in silence for a long time. After a while, he asks: “Did you hear that we allied with a prey species?”,

“You mean the Yotul Aristocracy? For me, the real news is that they finally made it public after four years. I have actually been to Lairn a couple of times, beautiful place and the inhabitants aren’t the usual meek herbivores. They have quite the martial tradition and a beautiful, vibrant culture. It’s fascinating how they are integrating their technology with ours really”.

He winces a bit a bit and growl: “Look, I’m not my cousin, but I seriously question the windstorm of trusting prey”,

“I get that, but the feds already noticed them. And had they inglobated the Yotul we would have found ourselves with a permanent thorn in our side. Besides, at the end of the war, when Aafa, Talsk, Nishal and Grenelka are gone they would still widely outnumber us. We need to find a modus vivendi with them, ruling a scorched universe, like the Dominion wanted, would be such a waste”.

“Interesting that you mention Nishal. Humans usually worry more about the Cradle.”“The Gojid?” I scoff, raising an eyebrow dismissively. He gives me a long look, tilting his maw slightly to the side.“What?”“You really looked like her for a second, Medusa.”

With a sideways glance, I reply, “For your information, my mother really hates that nickname.”He chuckles softly. Then his pupils flick toward the window and, breaking into open laughter, says: “Looks like someone’s ahead of us when it comes to interspecies cooperation.”I follow his gaze and spot Ursula and Alkimos happily making out under a lamppost, just before they lose their balance and unceremoniously fall into the snow. We exchange a glance and break into uncontrollable laughter.

We have barely recovered, when the two join in and Aspis ask them how was the snow. Ursula becomes completely red and Alkimos flicks his tails awkwardly. We have a second laugh at their expense while commenting about the quality of the view.  
  
To save them, since Ursula seems about to hide in her cup, I ask them about their plans for the upcoming Fall memorial holiday. Ursula says that she going to Scotland, apparently her parents were doing the West Highland Way when the Federation attacked and ended up stuck in a small Scottish town for months afterwards. So they try to visit every year, and they are seen as honorary members of the community. Alkimos tells us that for him it reminds a bit too much what happened to Esquo so he just going to spend a few quiet days up in the mountains. He then asks what I plan to do.

“Alessandro \[Achille ed.\] invited me to see the fireworks. I've actually never been to a public festivity, I’m usually stuck in some official ceremony. It’ll be a nice change”,

“I don’t understand how you guys can celebrate something like that”.

“It’s a generational thing. Our parents see it similarly. But for us is a way to shout to them you haven’t broken us, we are coming for you” interjects Ursula, and Aspis continues: “Also for us Arxur, it’s the day we stopped being alone in a cold universe. The day we found our brothers in arms”.

The chit-chat went on for most of the night, until they basically kicked us out. And for once in our little corner of this troubled galaxy, there was peace.

But this island nation is much more than a pretty postcard. Whether you're planning your honeymoon, a luxury getaway, or a peaceful solo retreat, the Maldives is filled with experiences that feel both magical and deeply personal.

If you’re wondering how best to spend your time in this paradise, here’s a warm and friendly guide to the **best things to do in the Maldives**, designed to help you make the most of every blissful moment.

# 1. Snorkelling and Diving with Marine Life

You don’t have to be a pro to enjoy the underwater wonders of the Maldives. Snorkelling is one of the easiest and most rewarding activities — many resorts provide complimentary gear, and you can simply wade into the water from the beach or your villa. Expect to see parrotfish, turtles, eagle rays, and the occasional reef shark.

For those looking to go deeper, diving opens up another world. The Maldives is home to stunning coral reefs, caves, and overhangs. Dive sites like Maaya Thila and Banana Reef are especially popular. Even first-time divers can join PADI courses offered right at many resorts.

# 2. Stay in an Overwater Villa

If there’s one experience that defines a trip to the Maldives, it’s staying in an overwater villa. Waking up to endless views of the ocean, enjoying your morning coffee with the sound of the waves below, and diving straight into the water from your private deck — it’s peaceful, luxurious, and truly unforgettable.

# 3. Explore the Beauty of a Private Island Resort

The Maldives is dotted with luxurious, self-contained resorts set on their own islands — and staying at a [private island resort in Maldives](https://theozencollection.com/maadhoo) is something truly special. With only guests and staff on the island, it feels like you have your own slice of paradise. These resorts offer unmatched privacy, tailored experiences, and some of the most breathtaking natural settings in the world.

# 4. Island Hopping Adventures

There are over 1,000 islands scattered across the Maldives, each with its own charm. Many resorts offer half-day or full-day island hopping tours. You can visit uninhabited islands for a picnic or stop by a local island to meet residents and learn about everyday Maldivian life. It's a great way to experience the contrast between polished resorts and authentic island culture.

# 5. Sunset Cruises & Dolphin Spotting

Watching the sun set over the Indian Ocean from a traditional [Maldivian dhoni ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhoni_(fishing_vessel))

is a moment to treasure. Some cruises even include champagne and canapés — perfect for a romantic evening. If you're lucky, you might spot spinner dolphins dancing through the waves. South Ari and Baa Atoll are particularly good for dolphin watching.

# 6. Water Sports for All Moods

Whether you're after calm or a bit of adrenaline, the Maldives delivers. You can glide through clear waters on a paddleboard or kayak, or pick up the pace with jet skiing, windsurfing, or wakeboarding. Most resorts have water sports centres, with friendly instructors who can guide beginners or help more experienced guests try something new.

# 7. Enjoy a Private Sandbank Picnic

Imagine being dropped off on a tiny sandbank surrounded by nothing but sea and sky. Resorts often organise private picnics where you're left with a beautifully packed basket, cool drinks, and a shade umbrella. It's peaceful, romantic, and completely unique — ideal for proposals, anniversaries, or just an extra special lunch.

# 8. Relax with Spa and Wellness Therapies

You’ll find world-class spas in nearly every Maldivian resort, many of them built over water or tucked into jungle settings. Signature massages, facials, and wellness rituals often use local ingredients like coconut oil and sea salt. Some resorts offer yoga and meditation with sunrise views, giving you the chance to reset both body and mind.

# 9. Visit a Local Island

To experience the real heartbeat of the Maldives, take a guided visit to a local inhabited island. Places like Maafushi or Thulusdhoo offer colourful streets, friendly locals, and small shops and cafés. It’s a great opportunity to learn about Maldivian culture and daily life, beyond the luxurious resort bubble.

# 10. Dine in an Underwater Restaurant

Few dining experiences in the world compare to eating beneath the ocean’s surface. An [underwater restaurant in the Maldives](https://theozencollection.com/maadhoo/dining/m6m-minus-six-meters)

 offers panoramic views of marine life while you enjoy fine cuisine. Watch stingrays glide past and schools of fish swirl around you as you savour every bite. It’s not just a meal — it’s a memory in the making.

# 11. Try Traditional Night Fishing

Fancy catching your own dinner? Join a night fishing trip, a beloved Maldivian tradition. Using hand lines and bait, you'll fish under a blanket of stars, and in many cases, the resort chef will cook your catch for you the next day. It’s both peaceful and exciting — and you’ll leave with a great story to tell.

# 12. Visit a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

The Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-protected site, is a must for nature lovers. From May to November, it becomes a feeding ground for giant manta rays and whale sharks — snorkelling in Hanifaru Bay is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. These experiences are carefully managed to ensure environmental protection.

**Final Thoughts**

The Maldives is more than just an idyllic beach destination — it’s a place where every experience feels meaningful. Whether you’re floating in the ocean, dining under the sea, or simply soaking in the beauty of your surroundings, the Maldives has a way of making you feel like you’re exactly where you’re meant to be.

So whether you’re booking your first trip or returning for another round of paradise, let this list of the best things to do in the Maldives guide your journey. With every moment, the islands promise something extraordinary.",1,1751890621.0,u_OilConscious2713,0,1.0,False

On the line, there were no job titles, no departments. Just us workers, shoulder to shoulder, standing up for dignity and fairness.

We don’t need a physical line to carry that spirit forward. Solidarity doesn’t stop just because the airhorns and picket signs are packed away.

Here are a few ways to keep the fire burning:

- Wear your OCEU pin on camera in Teams meetings.
- Set your virtual background to an OCEU image.
- Add a line to your Teams status. Something like: “Forever in solidarity” or “Proud union member. OCEU strong.”
- Reach out to the folks you met on the line. Keep those cross-unit connections going.
- Organize or join a casual virtual hangout or coffee hour with your regional crew.

Stay involved. Stay connected. Stay vocal. Stay visible.

If you’re feeling like something’s missing, it’s not just you. We didn’t get a proper debrief. No last huddle. If your regional line wants to come together for a union-member-only gathering, do it.

We need each other. This doesn’t just disappear because we logged back in.

Oh, and if management brings this up, and you’re really not in the mood, you can always say something to the effect of:

“I’m proud of our collective sacrifice and what we stood for, but I won’t be discussing it in this setting.”

What we built on those lines wasn’t temporary. It was a reminder of who we are when we stand together. Let’s carry that with us. Into our meetings, our communities, our conversations, and right into Labour Day and beyond.

We’re still here. We’re still CUPE 1750 OCEU. And we’re still in this together.

**This book just gave me the most CHAOTIC accidental kiss to reverse harem pipeline and I'm OBSESSED 😂🔥**

**""Their Exclusive Sweetheart""**

Y'all, I thought I was getting simple campus romance but this book said ""let me give you the most dramatic overreaction to an accidental kiss EVER"" and delivered pure entertainment gold!

**The premise:** Ella accidentally kisses Alexander (one of the untouchable TVU Five princes) and gets MOBBED by his fangirls. Just when she's about to get destroyed, the five guys show up and declare her their ""personal maid"" to protect her. Now she's stuck serving five gorgeous billionaire heirs while trying not to fall for any of them! The chaos is UNMATCHED! 💀

**Why I'm completely LIVING for this:**

* The fangirls treating an accidental kiss like ""ABSOLUTE UNFORGIVABLE TREASON"" - the DRAMA
* Beckett casually announcing ""she's our maid now"" like he's ordering coffee
* 50 chapters with 4.5 rating of pure reverse harem chaos
* Ella's ""why did it have to be the one guy with a fan club AND hit squad"" energy
* The way they step out of that limo like a perfume commercial - ICONIC
* Alexander having a sister complex explaining why he doesn't date anyone

**What's sending me into ORBIT:**

* ""You're not even in the same zip code as his league!"" - OUCH but accurate
* Ella working multiple jobs while her stepsister gets driven to school in luxury
* The mob going from ""GET HER"" to ""Good morning, young masters!"" in 0.2 seconds
* Beckett calling her a ""walking-talking porcupine"" and ""tiny hedgehog with attitude""
* Dexter not even looking up from his game during the entire dramatic rescue
* The salary offer making Ella's brain short-circuit mid-protest

**The character dynamics are PERFECT:**

* Alexander: Brooding volcano with sister complex
* Beckett: Playboy with a heart who orchestrated this whole thing
* Caelan: Gentle mysterious prince who messes with her hair
* Dexter: Gaming genius who's emotionally unavailable
* Emmett: Sunshine boy who's actually her real friend

FF really said ""let me write the most entertaining reverse harem setup ever"" and I'm already planning my entire week around this beautiful chaos!

**Rating: 5/5 stars** for pure entertainment ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Anyone else reading this? I NEED to know how Ella survives being their ""maid"" and when she realizes they're all falling for her. Also drop your best reverse harem campus romance recs! 😤

1ltsh36,https://v.redd.it/z23uibau0gbf1,How Can We Prepare for Long-Term Change When Short-Term Noise Is So Loud?,"📦 Big Picture: The most successful individuals and organizations of the next decade won’t be those who react fastest (unless we’re talking ping pong), they’ll be those who resist best. While others chase daily metrics and breaking news, true leaders are building systems that compound over years. This isn’t just about time management; it’s about rewiring how we think, decide, and measure success in an age designed to fracture our attention.

The Neuroscience Behind Our Short-Term Addiction

Our brains didn’t evolve for the modern world. The same dopamine pathways that once helped us survive immediate threats now hijack our decision-making every time we check our phones. Neuroscientist Dr. Anna Lembke’s research shows that every notification creates a mini-addiction cycle: anticipation → reward → crash → craving.

The Hidden Cost: Each context switch—from deep work to checking email—requires an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus. For knowledge workers averaging 150+ daily interruptions, this means spending most of the day in a cognitively compromised state.

Present bias isn’t just a psychological quirk—it’s a survival mechanism gone wrong. In studies, people consistently choose $50 today over $100 in a year, even when they intellectually know it’s irrational. This same bias makes us prioritize urgent emails over strategic planning.

Why Today’s Noise Is Uniquely Destructive

Previous generations faced distractions, but today’s are fundamentally different:

Algorithm-Driven Urgency: Social media and news platforms use AI to maximize engagement, not truth or importance. They’ve weaponized our cognitive biases.

Performative Productivity: Tools like Slack create an illusion of productivity while actually fragmenting deep work. The average executive spends 41% of their time on discretionary activities that offer little personal satisfaction and could be delegated.

Metric Myopia: We optimize for what’s measurable today (likes, daily active users, quarterly earnings) at the expense of what matters tomorrow (trust, resilience, sustainable growth).

The Compound Effect: Each reactive decision makes the next one easier. You don’t just lose focus—you lose the ability to focus.

The Architecture of Long-Term Thinking

Real change requires systematic intervention, not willpower. Here’s how to build an environment that favors long-term thinking:

Cognitive Architecture

The 10-10-10 Rule: Before major decisions, ask: “How will I feel about this in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years?” This simple framework shifts your temporal perspective.

Inversion Thinking: Start with failure. What would need to go wrong for your long-term goals to fail? Build defenses against those specific risks.

Energy Budgeting: Treat attention like a finite resource. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos makes important decisions only in the morning when his cognitive energy is highest.

Environmental Design

The Proximity Principle: Place long-term goals in your immediate environment, short-term temptations at a distance. One CEO prints his 10-year vision on his coffee mug—he sees it 5+ times daily.

Friction Engineering: Add steps to reactive behaviors, remove them from strategic ones. Turn off notifications, but make your strategic planning documents one-click accessible.

Temporal Landmarks: Use calendar events to create artificial deadlines for reflection. Schedule monthly “10-year thinking” sessions like you would any important meeting.

Social Architecture

Accountability Systems: Share long-term commitments publicly. Research shows people are 95% more likely to achieve goals when they commit to regular check-ins with someone else.

Strategic Partnerships: Find others playing the long game. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger’s 60-year partnership exemplifies how shared long-term thinking compounds.

Advanced Case Studies in Long-Term Thinking

Amazon’s “Day 1” Philosophy

Jeff Bezos institutionalized long-term thinking through the “Day 1” mindset—maintaining startup urgency while building for decades. Amazon’s willingness to lose money for years on AWS and Prime created trillion-dollar advantages competitors still can’t match. He also invested in the Clock of the Long Now, a clock in Texas that is designed to keep time for 10,000 years (that’s long term).

Key Insight: They measure success on different timescales for different initiatives. Customer obsession gets measured daily, while moonshot projects get 7-year windows.

Toyota’s 200-Year Plan

While most companies plan in quarters, Toyota maintains a 200-year strategic vision. Their “Toyota Production System” took 30+ years to fully develop but created sustainable competitive advantages.

Key Insight: They separate operational excellence (measured daily) from strategic innovation (measured in decades).

Singapore’s Water Independence

Facing water scarcity, Singapore launched a 50-year plan in the 1960s to achieve water independence. Through consistent long-term investment, they now export water technology globally.

Key Insight: They created institutional memory through documentation and leadership development, ensuring strategy survived leadership changes.

The Compound Interest of Attention

Small changes in how you allocate attention create exponential differences over time:

1% Better Daily: Improving your focus by just 1% daily compounds to 37x better over a year. This isn’t theoretical—it’s mathematical.

The Aggregation of Marginal Gains: British Cycling’s Dave Brailsford improved every tiny aspect of performance by 1%. The result: dominating the Tour de France and Olympics for a decade.

Strategic Saying No: For every yes to something unimportant, you’re saying no to something that could be transformational. Successful people become successful by what they don’t do.

Practical Implementation Framework

Week 1: Audit Your Attention

Track every interruption for three days
Identify your peak focus hours
Calculate your current “deep work ratio”
Week 2: Create Boundaries

Establish communication-free time blocks
Set up “office hours” for reactive tasks
Install focus apps that block distracting websites
Week 3: Build Long-term Rituals

Schedule weekly strategic thinking sessions
Create monthly progress reviews against long-term goals
Start a “future self” journal
Week 4: Optimize Your Environment

Redesign your workspace for deep work
Create visual reminders of long-term goals
Remove or reduce access to reactive triggers
The Future Belongs to the Patient

In a world optimizing for clicks and quarters, patience becomes a competitive advantage. The companies and individuals who master long-term thinking won’t just survive the next decade—they’ll define it.

Your Next Step: Choose one long-term goal that would change everything if achieved. Then architect your next week to spend just 10% more time on it. That’s not just advice—it’s compound interest in action.

🧬Question Strings for Strategic Thinking

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding.

“What does success look like in 1 year?” →

“What about 5 years?” →

“What about 20 years?” →

“What patterns emerge across these timescales?”

Remember: In a world of infinite distractions, your attention is your destiny. Choose wisely.

I recently had a check up again with a GI to do some blood work and she told me to continue on esomeprazole 40mg in the morning and 20mg famotidine (pepcid) at night. Funnily enough I have 0 symptoms at night, it's just during the day. I've also been given a nasal rinse as well as a round of singulair (montelukast), while taking a claritin  before bed.

Would like to note the blood work came back all normal (no celiac etc.) except for having a high igE (Immunoglobulin E) count, signaling a allergic reaction to something that my body is trying to fend off.

My question is: How long do you think it'll take me to get back to 100%? The GI told me the esomeprazole + famotidine combo should take 8 weeks for full relief. Do you have similar experiences to me if so what helped?",1,1751889852.0,LPR,2,1.0,False

It's cream cheese, raw cake batter mix, and sprinkles.... They make cake batter extract!!!! Wtf. 

Also she makes a basic glaze for donuts and things with half and half in it and DOESNT Refrigerate IT! Just powdered sugar, half and half, and vanilla extract.

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lo4lav/bridgebuilder_chapter_143/)

Williams and Carbon headed off any discussion about interacting with the rakaro immediately. They were emphatic that no one was to do anything to them. Don’t approach them, don’t touch them, don’t try and ride them, don’t hunt them. They are wild animals. We would use a drone to scan them more closely for research.

The rakaro were all anybody wanted to talk about all morning. That was hardly a surprise - the Tsla’o had considered them well on their way to being extinct, so finding more was a big deal. More generally the jump from having a hundred trillion acres of wild lands to actual animals was viewed as massive, but also necessary unless you wanted to manually do everything an ecosystem normally handled.

Alex couldn’t remember seeing bugs here the first time they had come around, and Carbon confirmed that the fruit they had found required insects for pollination. It just added questions, no answers in sight for the time being.

There were more theories than people in the mess by the time breakfast was done. That the Dyson sphere was a backup for naturally occurring life in the Orion arm, or a tourist attraction for incomprehensible aliens.  Several were firmly in conspiracy territory. The ‘they’ that controlled the artifact were printing living animals, complete with functional minds. The idea that they would then start printing people to replace the expeditionary crew was shot down - if it was possible, why not replace people back on Earth or Schoen to achieve their goals without having to build an entire dyson sphere?

Of course, a dyson sphere full of *nature* from at least two planets sounded exactly like a conspiracy theory, but they were living in it. There was still the matter of who had built it, if they were still around, and where ‘here’ was. Maybe there was some vastly more advanced alien race out there watching this go down as another season of their favorite reality TV show. The cameras that fed a live view to the map hidden in the grove up the hill worked fine.

The conversation was fun and a little unnerving, and very amicable all the way around - but there was still a lot of work left to get the base fully operational.


They spent the rest of the day doing more setup. That was expected, when the morning started it was less a functional forward base and more of a summer camp in the middle of a winter wonderland. And there was a lot to set up. As more buildings finished extrusion, people with more specialized roles were peeled off the main group to go do setup on things pertaining to their roles here. Carbon and Linda Zheng were overseeing setting up the workshop. Williams, Crenshaw, and Tokona specifically were working in the Command building.

The Human Marines and Tsla’o soldiers were distributed wherever things needed to be put together, mostly to the Hanger. Some parts were too difficult to extrude in place, the hardware to do that would be more expensive, more delicate, and take up more space. Like the parts of the bridge crane that had motors and electronics in it. The bridge crane that would allow them to put the shuttle together.

“Alright, so... This is upside down, right?” Alex held the tablet up to the pedestal where the main electronics board was going, comparing the empty box and the perfectly square mainboard. It was sealed in a thick layer of impact resin, but the in and out plugs on each side were exactly the same and the diagram didn’t make it clear which way was which. He asked Abbot, who had been pressed into working up here for the funniest reason possible.

“*No*.” Since there were a bunch of Tsla’o here too, Abbot was working on his Tsla when there were lower stakes for mistakes. His accent made him sound like he was from the southern islands, which was a surprise to everybody. “*I say that goes up way*.”

Abbot was years ahead of him in the speaking Tsla fluently department, but *not quite* all the way there. It still got piped through Alex’s translator without issue. “Shit, ok. We’ll give it a try.” Sure would be nice if they had Carbon up here to do all this, or probably Zheng because she worked on Confed Naval hardware professionally.

Alex crammed the board into place, the evenly spaced connectors on the back clicking as it seated on them, and then extended the input links into their hopefully appropriate plugs. The light on the pedestal came on, which was supposed to happen. He flipped the power switch.

Nothing occurred initially, but nothing caught on fire either. The magic smoke remained where it was supposed to be. The screen atop the pedestal came on, warming up and running through the startup process. 

Success. Take that, questionable instructions!

Abbot chortled over the comm. “Ah, *supreme*.”

Alex kind of hoped he would stop doing that. He understood why Abbot was working on it, so he wasn’t mad at him or anything. It was just a little annoying.

Zenshen connected to the team comm network again, trudging into the half-finished hanger bay with a big portable genset in one hand, and a loop of power conduit slung over her shoulder. “They were hoarding everything down at the workshop.” She set all that down and went to work starting up the generator.

Now, it was Abbot’s time to shine. Or rather, the suit he had chosen. “*Excrement.*""

All of the Tsla’o on the team comm laughed.

“You might want to try... *Hells* would probably work. It’s common and no one will look at you weird.” Zenshen flipped the breaker and the generator hummed to life, the lights on the side showing it at full output. “Alright words-man, let’s get you plugged in and lifting shit.”

John Abbot’s choice of suit, the Pacesetter, the largest and most durable environment suit available to them. Unlike the more general purpose RS units all the other Human civilians had chosen, it was intended mostly for construction crews of all sorts. Demolition. Search and Rescue. Anywhere stuff might collapse on you. 

Abbot saw it as protection in an unknown area, which was understandable. It was. But he did not realize that the suit was also able to be operated in a strength boosted mode, as long as you had an external power supply. Like the one the Sergeant had brought up.

Their linguistics guy now also doubled as heavy equipment.

Stana had worked with Human crews in limited capacity before in Na’o, specifically ones involved in construction and reclamation work. She recognized the suit and voluntold him that he’d be holding up the I beams while they were affixed into the crane structure, so the building could finish extruding without having to wait for the actual heavy lifter to be delivered late in the afternoon.

“*Hells*.” He did not sound enthused.

“*You are connected*. Hang on, let me just...” Zenshen switched between languages on the fly. She already had the power conduit connected to the genset, and got the Pacesetter juiced up in short order. She patted the back of Abbot’s suit twice. “You’ll be fine, switch it to carry mode and don’t try to rush. Everyone I saw using these for moving stuff loved it.”

“As you say.” Abbot didn’t try to keep using Tsla for that. He started for the row of I beams stacked on the delivery sled outside, his normal walking speed much slower now. Evenly paced and methodical. Shutters on the back of the suit over the lump of system for life support and the like opened up, heat exchangers unfolding from them.  “Carry mode engaged, full power accessible. Heatsinks at maximum. Hm. It’s like walking through mud.”

Alex switched to a private comm line to Stana. “Are you sure this is a good idea?” He would have dismissed this venture outright if she hadn’t known so much about the capabilities of the suit, and the manual did say it was perfectly safe for novice users. It would scan materials and tell you where to pick individual objects up and everything.

She shrugged, watching Abbot step into the falling snow outside and square up to the first beam. “I’m telling you, some of the guys they had doing demo work shouldn’t have been allowed to use a tablet, and they never got hurt.”

Abbot stood there, head swiveling back and forth in the helmet that looked like something intended for deep sea diving. He wiped two spots on the beam free of snow and carefully placed one hand and the other into them, fingers clamping down tight, and shifted his feet to a slightly wider stance.

He lifted the beam off the sled, nice and slow. Not so much as a wobble. “Hah. Haha!”

There was a smattering of applause as Alex switched back to the team channel. “How’s it working out for you, Abbot?”

“Great! This is incredible. It says this is nearly two hundred kilos and I can barely feel it.” He was, as Crenshaw would put it, jazzed. “The AR system on this suit is fantastic. I hadn’t used it all until now.” 

Zenshen bumped Alex’s arm, and gave him a look. The Tsla’o armor not having a helmet still threw him off, but it made it very easy for him to read the ‘told you’ that she mouthed at him.

Unrelated to all of what was going on, he found it strange how easy it was to read her lips. He was sure all that extra mouth on the muzzle - if not the whole ‘muzzle’ thing - should throw it off, but it didn’t. Alex nodded in response, holding his hands out. Yeah, she was right.

The Pacesetter’s onboard system was able to direct him to exactly where the beam needed to go, Abbot standing there with it held directly over his head like some kind of Olympic weightlifter. The marines had been waiting for this, scrambling up the stepladder to set the alignment clamps and run the welder over the seam.

It took a few hours to get everything finished, all the other electronics systems and overhead lights installed while the ceiling could be reached with a stepstool, and then sweeping everyone out and closing the hanger doors so it could finish the extrude. By morning it would be tall enough they could fit an entire completed shuttle inside.

The snow had started to pick up as the ‘sun’ was starting to dim - Alex fought the urge to say it was setting, as it didn’t set here. It was always overhead, some trickery making the color of the light a convincing simulacrum of the way the world should look during those times of day. Perhaps it was more accurate to say that it was about time for dinner.

They trudged down the hill, queued up to go through the airlock. It was pretty light in the mess still, a handful of people from both of the other buildings were already eating. To keep the machines running at an optimal pace, they did remote ordering. For the Human dispensers, at least. Access the mess wireless, put in an order using the flashy interface, wait for the machine to notify you which dispenser your food is waiting in. Depending on what you were ordering, the system could print enough to feed all twenty of them inside of half an hour.

The menu available was aggressively competent. He hadn’t really dealt with Human dispensers in the last few months - save for the Berkmann, which was mostly coffee and donuts. This morning, breakfast had been decided just as soon as they walked into the mess... But Alex absolutely understood how Carbon had felt when he asked her to get him soup back on the *Kshlav’o* now. He didn’t have any favorites saved and wasn’t craving anything in particular, so he scrolled through chicken dishes for a couple of minutes.

Chicken was safe. It printed well. Didn’t make a choice any easier.

Eventually Alex settled on chicken yakisoba, five out of ten spicy, extra vegetables. Noodles are so straightforward he’d never seen a dispenser mess them up unless the printmesh was breaking down in some fashion. Drinks still had to be gotten manually. He got a cup of coffee, feeling a bit tired already but unwilling to entertain going to bed before 7 pm without a really good reason.

Abbot returned to the table with his meal, having placed his order almost ten several minutes ago while Alex was having choice paralysis. He pulled the film off the top, a pair of tuna steaks resting atop of a field of peppers and tomatoes.

“Is that... Did you get tuna piperade?” Alex’s voice did go up a little bit. Fish, out of a military dispenser, felt like a gamble. It was safe, of course, it would never print a live tapeworm or actual poison. Shouldn’t, anyway. Safe to eat, at least. Safe to taste might be another story.

“I thought the MRE version was good, so I wanted to try a fresh one.” He did not wait to dig in. Abbot had moved tons of material this afternoon, so clearly he had worked up an appetite. “This is much better.”

“Damn, all right.” It did smell pretty good, now that it was wafting over to him.

John Abbot had finished eating and was working on his second cup of tea by the time Alex’s food was done. He had popped the built-in tablet out of his Pacesetter and was reading while Alex worked on an actually good yakisoba. Might go up to seven on the spice next time.

“Ah, there it is.” Abbot said to himself, pleased that his sleuthing had paid off.

“There what is?” Stana inquired, sliding in beside Alex with a tray from the Human dispensers that was already open, half a chicken tender missing from it.

“After doing all the work in the hanger today I was wondering what kind of shuttle they would be sending, so I checked the manifest.” Abbot had seemed much more enthusiastic about doing physical work after that first beam had gone up without any issue, effectively thanks to him. “And our *Mister Sorenson* has four grav sleds with his name on them coming in tomorrow. Well, not literally. They’re not *to* anyone in particular.”

“Don’t start with that Mister stuff too.” It was bad enough that Williams called him that when he was being annoying. Alex wasn’t looking forward to it catching on as a general nickname, particularly since Carbon would start calling him that as well, and likely never stop. “Does it say what it is?”

He looked down “Yes, a Corvin 85E.”

Corvin made good vehicles, and the 85 series was one of their most flexible. Seats eight in addition to the crew, and has a head and very, very small galley. Mostly intended for ground-to-ground or ground-to-orbit, it was equipped with hardpoints for a very small Waverider drive upgrade.

Not exactly something he’d want to take a 30 million kilometer trip in, unless they had a way to convince a Waverider drive, another large gravity field, and atmosphere to play nice together. “Oh, interesting. I didn’t know those could be palletized.”

“Apparently the can!” He tucked the tablet back into his suit, done with snooping for now.

John Abbot’s enthusiasm for that struck Alex as a touch unexpected. “So, you into ships too?”

“A little bit. Not my first interest, obviously. I like the idea of being able to get around when I want - and I know that sounds foolish having never tried to get a pilots license or even having been to space until a week ago.” He laughed, the sound quiet and sad.

“Sounds perfectly normal to me.” Stana added around a mouthful of fries. “Being able to pick up and go is fantastic, I’ve heard.”

“I agree.” Alex lined up the question all pilots seemed to ask each other, and prepared to judge Abbot harshly for his answer. “If money were no object, what would you be getting?”

He didn’t have to think about it for very long. “I always wanted a De Luca Azzurra.”

Alex wanted to, but did not, roll his eyes. An Azzurra was what people said when they didn’t know any better. Nothing wrong with them, but beyond the flashy, aggressive styling they were fine. *Just* fine. Abbot was not a fellow pilot, so Alex kept his judgement safely tucked away. “Oh yeah, I’ve heard those are nice.”

He sipped his tea. “What about you two?”

“*Kshanev*-class battleship. Doesn’t matter which one.” Stana knew exactly what she wanted. “Full crew complement.”

They both turned to look at her.

She shrugged. “I like the lines, and I can’t make it go on my own.”

“That’s fair.” It was probably better than an Azzura. “Ever heard of the Masamune GX8?”

Abbot was, to Alex’s dismay, staring at him like he had no idea what that was. “No, what is it?”

That hurt his soul. “It’s an older model, kinda rare. Used to be stripped down for racing.”

“Didn’t know that. I’ll look it up when we get back on the other side of the portal.” He tapped his finger on his chin, looking over the manifest again. “What should we name it?”

“Name what?” Alex asked. Abbot didn’t just invite himself to be part of the naming process, did he? Sure, that was a scoutship program thing, but he had his one opportunity to name a scoutship taken so this was close enough.

“The Corvin. I like ‘Icarus’, myself.”

Alex didn’t say anything for a long moment. “There’s a lot wrong to unpack there. We- I’m not naming the ship Icarus. Didn’t you hear about what happened to the drone they sent to check the upper atmosphere?” The first drones sent into the artifact were for recon to establish a perimeter, and monitor weather. One specialized drone was for upper atmosphere monitoring, and it got about twenty kilometers up, and then came back down as a slug of molten alloys. They tried again with a more durable recon drone, which found a layer of fluctuating temperatures they couldn’t pin down, but the onboard shielding was enough to keep it from happening twice. 

Alex was not too superstitious, but the similarities were uncomfortable.

“Well now we know where the boundar-”

He wasn't having it. “No. I’m the first pilot, naming is my right. And Icarus is right out.”

“What is the problem with Icarus? It rolls off the tongue, even if it’s a nonsense word.” Stana was confused by Alex’s vehement reaction to that suggestion. She said it again with a heavy Tsla accent, “*ih-kar-is*. Smooth but meaningless.”

Alex held up his hands. “Ok, ancient myth, right? This guy, a master architect named Daedalus, builds a huge maze for King Minos. I will not be getting into *why* he did that, it’s messed up. So he builds it, the king imprisons Daedalus and his son, Icarus, so they won’t tell people about the maze or what was in it. You know how royalty are, right?”

Stana watched him for a few seconds, expressionless. “No, I have no idea.” She took a long pull off her tea while staring him down.

“Right. Anyway, Daedalus builds himself and his son wings out of wax and feathers, they fly the hell out of there. Icarus forgets what he’s doing, flies too close to the sun, his wings melt, and then he falls out of the sky and drowns.”

Zenshen sipped her coffee, nodding. “Yes, we will not name a flying craft after someone who falls from the sky.”

“See?” He pointed his fork at Stana. “She gets it.”

Abbot relented on that front. “Ok. What about Prometheus?”

He shook his head. “Chained to a boulder and having his liver eaten every day. Nope.”

“The Valkyrie.” He almost sounded conspiratorial as he said it, as though he’d been keeping this one a secret for just the right moment.

“They decide who lives and dies on the battlefield, no way. Has nothing to do with this mission at all.” Alex finished his yakisoba, and got up to dump the tray into the recycler. He paused before stepping away. “Stana, you gotta be able to come up with a name that’s better than what he’s suggesting.”

She had it ready to go. “Perhaps... *Ankao*.”

“Explorer, correct?” Abbot asked.

Zenshen gave him a nod. It was.

Alex returned to his seat with a fresh refill of coffee, gesturing at both of them. “See, look at that. No death, battle, organs getting ripped out, or anything.”

“That is not to say such things couldn’t happen to an explorer, of course. A person who takes that mantle may be more likely to die horribly than someone who does not.” She added a moment later.

“Helpful as always.” He shook his head.

“Fine. What are you going to call it?” Abbot leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest.

Alex lifted his coffee to his lips, a smirk hidden behind the synthetic mug. “I’m thinking... The Titanic.”

Everything is fine and i'm happy to start my journey to lose weight except that i am really struggling to keep up my daily calories under 924 or even 1,000.

I add my breakfast or whatever it can be to it and my daily limit is already used up. And it leads me to being stressed out. I do not workout so i try to take care about my daily calorie intake as much as i can at least but at the same time i don't know how can i do it. Every day i exceeded the calorie limit, not by a lot but i still did.

I am around 63-64 KG right now and my goal is to reach around 50 KG by the end of November or around November. Maybe since i have such hard goal that's why i am struggling because i know it can not always be comfortable.

Is there any way to make this more easy? I just eat vegetable and eggs for breakfast, and try to eat meat and add something next to it for dinner, and coffee all day. I  try hard but i still can not keep up with this calory number.

1lts71p,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/1lts71p/a_collection_of_questions_for_any_and_all/,A collection of questions for any and all,"Rather than making a bunch of random posts I just thought I'd try throwing a few seemingly random questions out there, see if I could source out some logical group answers.  Most are MM related, feel free to answer any or all

1. Regarding Lemon Tek.  Is fresh squeezed lemon a must or do people find similar results with using a bottled product like RealLemon?
2. Does the 'experience' matter when it comes to busting on MM's?  Example for me.  I'd rather take a dose and then go out for a walk in the woods and enjoy nature.  Is there more 'therapeutic' effect by zoning out on the couch and immersing yourself in a retrospective 'trip'??  My thoughts it's the dose not what you do with it but ??
3. Regarding food.  I have a crazy fast metabolism, eat a LOT and I am prone to low blood sugar episodes. I would rather not go hypoglycemic mid-trip.  So I always eat at some point before.  Also generally eat a Paleo/Keto style higher-fat diet, so lots of slow digesting happening ALL the time.  Food is known to affect the response to MM's but is that through some sort of binding to psilocybin molecules or is it something else.  If I take a dose, feel the onset and then eat an hour or two later, does my body still receive the same amount of active 'chemical' and I just don't get the full psychedelic experience or is it something else?  Fasting for a 'trip' is not an option
4. I don't do well with supplementing vitD in the form of a synthetic capsule/liquid but thrive in the sunshine.  Late winter always leaves me borderline low and often deep into a cluster cycle which may or may not be connected.  We're in full summer here (southern ON) and I am out getting 4-6hrs full-sun most days so I have to assume my natural vitD levels are peaking.  Ironically I've also be headache free for a month now.  A possible connection with testing blood levels?   I have been trial specific strains of MJ as well as being on round 4 of a MM bust so there are many variables to consider
5. On Saturday I had an XL coffee with my (second) mid-day dose and got absolutely walloped about 15mins later.  I couldn't believe how fast the onset hit me and how intense it was.  FWIW, I had taken 1g at 10:30AM and at 1PM felt nothing, so took a second 1g with my post-lunch coffee and it was like getting hit by a large hammer.  Could the large hit of caffeine have intensified the bodies response (strength and speed of onset)
6. Does anyone have any experiences to share with successfully busting a CH cycle on a standard 'every 5th day' protocol, then switching to more of a general maintenance, Stamet style micro-dosing protocol for the long-term mental/physical health benefits?  Possibly switching back to bust a cycle it it shows up.  Rinse and repeat ...

Thanks in advance, hopefully some of that made sense! ..",1,1751889305.0,clusterheads,0,1.0,False
1lts6q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hairtransplant/comments/1lts6q5/side_effects_with_hair_transplant/,Side Effects with Hair Transplant,"tAfter having a 2600 graft HT, I wanted to share my experience with side effects for those considering on pulling the trigger. While researching the HT process my excitement in getting this done and looking brand new over looked the fact that side effects come with the process. I put together a list of my post procedure side effects the effected me the most. 

1. Pain- I knew that Pain is a common side effect but didn't know it would persist weeks after surgery. Most of the pain is over donor area and has lasted for over a week after HT. They tell you to sleep face up but with the Pain it kinda hard to do. Advil every 4 hours helped me sleep. 

  
2. Swellin- I also knew there would be swelling post HT, I didn't know the fluids would fall to the bridge of my nose and eyes, even while using a head band. For me they told me not to look down and again sleep face up but gravity took its course and fell no matter what. This lasted over a week, forhead first, then eyebrows, bridge of the nose then eyes, walking around looking like frankeinstein. This not painful but worriesome if not expected

  
3. Itching- HOLY CRAP! I knew there would be itching due to the healing process of the donor and transplant areas but GD! Trying not to scratch while the above is happening is torture. The donor area lasted the longest in my case, and the transplanted area lasted only a couple of days. I lightly tapped the area with my hand but damn!

  
4. Numbness- The tingleing on the head and the feeling of a huge basketball on my shoulders lasted for more than a couple of days but bareable. 

5. No Caffine- As a morning coffee drinker it was a challenge not to have my coffee in the morning for 5 days.

6 Sex- They told me none for 10 days, this to reduce the flow of blood to the head and rise in heart rate/pressure. 

There are other side effects that can occur like scarring, fever, and infections. But this is what I am going through so I thought I would share with those who are considering a HR .",2,1751889274.0,Hairtransplant,2,1.0,False

1lts64e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeStories93/comments/1lts64e/i_solved_a_murder_case_by_accident_and_got_an/,I solved a murder case by accident and got an award for catching the wrong guy,"I was a junior detective at the time, mid-30s, quiet, focused, not flashy, The case that landed in my lap was a brutal one, Local art dealer found dead in his gallery, throat slit, all security footage wiped clean, only clue was a half-smudged handprint on a glass sculpture and a strange silver coin found next to the body,

No fingerprints matched in the system, No signs of forced entry, Whoever did it knew the place, knew the cameras, knew what they were doing,

I spent weeks running every angle, Questioned his employees, clients, even a rival gallery owner who once threatened him during an art auction, Everyone had alibis, Most seemed devastated, except one guy — Mark Rellin, a restorer who worked late nights and had been fired a month prior for stealing paint solvents, Weird guy, twitchy, always carried metal trinkets in his pockets,

He became my guy, He had motive, access, and just enough resentment to cross the line, I couldn’t get him to confess, but I found out he had a coin collection — rare types, and one was missing, same kind found at the crime scene, I built the case piece by piece, every late night, every coffee-soaked file, Until I finally had enough circumstantial evidence to present it to the chief,

We scheduled a department meeting so I could officially lay it out, Everyone gathered in the conference room — full house, I went over everything, the timeline, the coin, the motive, and finally said, “My prime suspect is Mark Rellin,”

And that’s when Officer Jensen stood up in the back, He was pale, sweating, hands shaking, He said, “It wasn’t Mark,” and we all turned, He stared straight at me and said, “It was me,”

Silence,

He confessed right there, Said he’d been stealing from the gallery for months, The dealer caught him one night and threatened to go public, He snapped, used a broken sculpture shard to kill him, The coin? It fell out of his own jacket during the struggle — he was a coin freak too, just like Mark, even rarer stuff, But no one knew about it, he never talked hobbies at work,

He walked out with his hands up, and we were too stunned to stop him, The chief cuffed him five minutes later in the parking lot,

Here’s the kicker — my suspect, Mark, was completely innocent, He just happened to be weird at the wrong time, But nobody ever noticed I was wrong, Everyone assumed I knew it was Jensen all along and was using Mark to push a confession,

I tried to correct them, tried to explain it was just dumb luck, That I was as surprised as everyone else,

Nobody cared,

The mayor gave me a plaque at a ceremony the following week, Said my “tenacity brought justice to our community,” I still keep it on a shelf in my apartment, not because I’m proud, but because every time I look at it, I remember the lesson that made me a real detective,

Sometimes the truth isn’t what you find — it’s what trips and confesses when you weren’t even looking,

We have been together for 10 years and married just shy of 5 years. She underwent MAJOR weight loss via Zepbound, lots of red flags occurred, and she filed for divorce.

1. She had a rough childhood. Her mother divorced my STBXW's father and she witnessed a terrible divorce. The man was left with nothing. Since then (this was over 20 years ago), she bounced around from man to man to man. My STBXW witnessed this her entire life. During that time, she suffered emotional abuse from her mother... ""get on the treadmill you are fat!"". She admitted that years ago she was sexually assaulted by one of her mother's lovers. When she confronted her mother on this she basically said ""no, you are lying, and you probably led him on anyway"".
2. She suffered from body image issues and low self-esteem her entire life. She was never IMO that big when I was with her. But before I was with her she was quite big.
3. She has VERY limited friends. Really no hobbies. I didn't mind during our relationship because I loved her. I have many friends but she never really wanted to associate. ALL of my friends now admit she was very standoffish and unwelcoming.
4. She hasn't talked to her mother in years. She is off/on with her brother. She will cut him off and has several times for various reasons and then will re-kindle that relationship.
5. She has always had problems with co-workers
6. She dropped dramatic weight in the span of about 2 months on Zepbound. She is also on anti-depressants.
7. The weird comments and redflags started to emerge during this weight loss such as: ""a man said I was beautiful today at starbucks and he bought me coffee"". ""I have fantasies of you watching me have sex with another man"". ""My male co-worker says he masturbates to the thought of me"". ""you are in the military, when you deploy you should get a hall pass and have sex with whomever you want"". Now, the sex with us was actually good during this period. The final straw was while I was away on a trip, she deleted Ring/Blink footage of her coming and going late at night. When I got home and confronted her on this, she said she has been unhappy for a long time and is filing for divorce.

Ever since her filing it is like she is a completely different person. No emotion. She gaslights me on everything and has flipped the script with every scenario. She has become NASTY with crazy comments. We agreed to not have children years ago and I got a vasectomy. She admitted that ""with the right man I would consider having kids"". That hurt. She admitted that ""marriage is a piece of paper"". She says I am the reason for this and she admits no fault at all. We are co-living in this house and she dresses up almost every night to go out. My co-worker found she has a Bumble. She originally said ""lets be amicable through this"". Well, based on her crazy requests I had no choice but to hire a lawyer.

I went NC. Shortly after, she asked for a hug. I said no.

I truly think she is a Covert Narcissist and the mask came off with the extreme weight loss.

She is turning into her mother.... the women she DESPISED my entire 10 years with her. I remember her saying how disgusting it is that her mom can't be comfortable with herself and needs to bounce from man to man. My wife is now that woman!

I've sacrificed half my life (teens and 20s), most of my personal goals, wants and needs while drowning in family debt and being my father's caregiver. All my friends and acquitances have turned their backs because no one wanted to get close to the shit I was dealing with. Basically, not only did I not have any money, I also lived in complete isolation, lacking any freedom and contact with people and the outside world, since moving out would've been a death sentence to my parents.

Over time I've managed to get some formal education and thanks to an insane stroke of luck a well paying job. The thing is, since my attention was entirely elsewhere and I've never had any guidance in any subject in life, outside of my work responsibilities I am highly uncultured. I don't know anything about politics, religion, geography, human interaction, relationships, trends in music, manners, you name it. I've been wearing a mask ever since and just saving up with no plan. Eventually my father passed when I was close to 29 and I felt even more disoriented, as my lifetime duties have ended.

To try and numb the pain, for the past 3 years I've been hiding behind work and despite coming from family poverty and entering systemic poverty that's plaguing the world - I'm thriving. Got some basics in check, like my own place and a driver's license, currently searching for a car. But that's the only thing I'm sorta good at. It's like I escaped everything that should've killed me, but now I don't know what I'm living for. I don't know who I am, what I want and what even is there for me to want. Feels like I suddenly spawned in this 32 year old body while the rules have changed, the world has long moved on. Everything seems so alien. When I go outside or happen to be in an informal social setting, I try my hardest not to appear as a caveman, but it's ridiculously apparent when I fumble while simply ordering a coffee. This is the shame I'm living with lol.

This is part of a self study experiment I’ve been running to honestly test how certain substances affect my mood, cognition, and overall experience. Posting this for discussion, not encouragement. I’m doing this legally and privately in a safe setting, and always with intention.

I’m a 26 y/o male, around 107kg, and I’ve tried the following so far:

🥃 Alcohol (Vodka) – BAC 0.08 to 0.10

Took careful doses to reach BAC of ~0.10 based on online calculators and time.

Honestly… I understand now why people drink. Music gets better deeper. Games are more fun. Conversations and even boring tasks feel enhanced.

It felt like my baseline dopamine was elevated. Not in a manic way just more everything's okay and kinda fun.

My favorite game Valorant that I no longer play because of boredom. I felt like I was playing it for the first time, as if the passion had returned. Haha. I remember every kill I made I feel something in my brain, its like I felt the dopamine moves lol

It pulled me out of low/bad/angry moods easily temporarily. Not permanently, but for those 1–2 hours, life felt easier.

It’s not overhyped for what it does but it’s very temporary and obviously not sustainable with significant health risks unfortunately.

You should put yourself in activity (music, games, sex, show or anything else) to feel difference, it more enjoyable if you have even one friend with you.

🟡 Nicotine (ZYN 3mg, then 12mg trial)

Started with 3mg pouches for 4 days straight. Felt some buzz, focus, light-headedness, like a strong coffee with a head rush.

Then tried 12mg once too much. Got cold sweats, nausea. Backed off.

No real mood boost. No dopamine surge. No good ""vibes"" Just a stimulant.

It’s very overrated unless you're addicted or chasing a mental edge. I don’t get how people enjoy cigarettes or vaping unless they’re already hooked.

🤔 Where I’m Going Next

Because nicotine and alcohol felt mild or just slightly pleasurable, I’m planning to gradually experiment with stronger substances to better understand their psychological effects purely from a social science and curiosity perspective.

We know in Tunisia it’s very hard to find clean, safe stuff, which makes it harder to trust the experience. So any roadmap/advice in this point?

I’m not chasing addiction I just want to understand why so many people risk their lives for substances I found... kinda mid.

🗣️ My Question to You:

For people who tried cocaine, meth, heroin, or psychedelics, what exactly did you feel the first time?

And if you regret trying, why?

Please keep it honest. I’m not here to glorify anything I just want to hear from people who’ve actually been there, especially those who tried “stronger” stuff and either came back or learned something from it.",2,1751888628.0,Tunisia,8,0.67,False

Your body holds an ancient intelligence — a self-healing system that modern science is just beginning to understand.

Here’s a practical guide to activating it:

# 🛠️ Step-by-Step: How-To Self-Heal

Set a Clear Healing Intention🗣️ “I now activate my body’s self-healing intelligence.”

1. **Visualise the Outcome You Desire**
   * Picture yourself healthy, joyful, and thriving.
   * Smile. Stand tall. Believe it is *already* happening.
2. **Activate a Healing State** Choose one:
   * Breathwork (box, holotropic, or Wim Hof)
   * Meditation (theta/gamma entrainment)
   * Nature walk or flow activity (e.g. dancing, yoga)
3. **Stack Your Neurochemistry** Combine:
   * 🧬 Fasting or keto state (for clarity and DMT potential)
   * 🧂 Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, magnesium
   * 🧠 Magnesium + Omega-3s + NAC (for calm + neuroprotection)
   * 💊 (Optional) Microdose LSD or psilocybin for insight and rewiring
   * 🌿 (Optional) THC microdose to soften, deepen, or open emotional portals
4. **Surrender to the Process**
   * Let go of needing immediate proof.
   * Trust the system.
   * Healing is often non-linear — and quantum.

# 🔬 How It May Work: Your Inner Biochemistry

# 🧬 1. Endogenous DMT – The Spirit Molecule Within

Your body produces **N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT)** —  
a powerful, naturally occurring compound linked to dreaming, deep rest, mystical insight, and potentially accelerated healing.

# 🧪 Biosynthesis Pathway Highlights

Endogenous DMT is synthesised through the following enzymatic steps:

* **Tryptophan → Tryptamine** via *aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD)*
* **Tryptamine → N-Methyltryptamine → N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT)** via *indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT)*

These enzymes are active in tissues such as:

* **Pineal gland**
* **Lungs**
* **Retina**
* **Choroid plexus**
* **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**

LC–MS/MS studies have confirmed **measurable levels of DMT in human CSF**, and INMT expression has been mapped across multiple human and mammalian tissues.

# 🧠 Functional Role

* Modulates **synaptic plasticity**, consciousness, and stress resilience
* May act as an **emergency neural reset** during trauma, near-death experiences, or profound meditation
* Possible involvement in:
   * REM sleep/dreaming
   * Near-death and peak experiences
   * Deep psychedelic states
   * Certain healing crises or spontaneous remissions

# 🔁 Enhancing Natural DMT Dynamics

* **Ketogenic states** may enhance DMT-related enzymes via mitochondrial and epigenetic pathways
* **Breathwork, meditation, and sleep** can shift brainwave states (theta/gamma) known to correlate with endogenous DMT release

# 💡 2. Dopamine – The Motivation & Belief Messenger

* Governs hope, reward, motivation, and learning
* Modulates immunity and inflammation
* **Metabolic stability (via keto or fasting)** supports clean dopamine transmission

# 🧘‍♂️ 3. Belief & Intention – The Frequency Tuners

* Belief gives permission. Intention gives direction.
* Activates prefrontal cortex, salience networks, and interoception circuits
* Entrainment via repetition can reprogramme biological set points

# 🌀 Framework: Theta–Gamma Healing Loop

1. **Theta Brainwave Entry (4–7 Hz)**
   * Deep meditation, trance breathwork, or hypnagogia
2. **Gamma Activation (40+ Hz)**
   * Gratitude, awe, love, focused intention
3. **Coupling Outcome**
   * May enhance DMT signalling, neuroplasticity, and immune recalibration
   * Ketones may support sustainable entry into this state

# ⚗️ Neurochemical + Metabolic Stack Pyramid

A structured view of the inner pharmacy — from foundational support to conscious expansion:

    ⚡️ Top — Conscious Expansion
    ──────────────────────────────
    Microdosing (non-daily):  
    • LSD 7–12 μg  
    • Psilocybin 25–300 mg  
    THC (1–2.5 mg edible or mild vape, optional)
    
    🧠 Mid — Brain & Mood Modulators
    ──────────────────────────────
    Rhodiola Rosea (adaptogen – stress resilience)  
    L-Tyrosine (dopamine precursor – take *away* from microdoses)  
    L-Theanine (calm alertness – with or without coffee)  
    NAC (glutamate balance & antioxidant support)  
    Tryptophan / 5-HTP ⚠️ (*Avoid with serotonergic psychedelics*)  
    
    💊 Micronutrients – Daily Neuroendocrine Support
    ──────────────────────────────
    Vitamin D3 + K2 (immune + calcium metabolism)  
    Zinc (neuroprotection + immune balance)  
    B-complex with P5P (active B6 – methylation + dopamine)  
    
    🧂 Base — Nervous System & Energy Foundations
    ──────────────────────────────
    Magnesium (glycinate or malate – calm + repair)  
    Omega-3s (EPA/DHA – neural fluidity)  
    Electrolytes (Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺)  
    MCT oil or exogenous ketones  
    Fasting (12–36 hrs) or ketogenic nutrition

# 🌿 Can a Little THC Help Activate Self-Healing?

Yes — when used respectfully and intentionally, **small amounts of THC** can support healing by modulating the endocannabinoid system and mental focus.

# 🔬 How a Little THC May Support the Process

|Mechanism|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|🧘‍♂️ Nervous system relaxation|Reduces sympathetic overdrive; promotes parasympathetic tone|
|🎯 Enhanced focus on intention|Quiets default mode network; deepens inner attention|
|🌌 Supports altered states|Facilitates theta state and inward journeys|
|❤️ Emotional release|Brings repressed emotions to surface for integration|
|🧠 Neuroplasticity modulation|May support belief rewiring and cognitive reset|

# ⚖️ Dose = Medicine or Muddle

* 🔸 1–2.5 mg edible or low-dose vape
* 🔸 Optional: Combine with CBD for a gentler experience
* 🔸 Use in a **safe, intentional setting** — avoid overuse or distraction

# 🔁 Combine With Intention + Practice:

* 🧘 Breathwork or theta-state meditation
* 🎧 Binaural beats or healing music
* 🌿 Nature immersion (preferably grounded)
* ✍️ Journaling, affirmations, or gratitude rituals

>*THC isn’t the healer. You are.*  
But it can open the door to your own pharmacological intelligence.

# 🧬 Is This Evolutionary?

Yes. Your body evolved:

* To **survive and repair** in extreme conditions
* To initiate **neurochemical resets** via fasting, belief, and ritual
* To access **altered states** as healing mechanisms
* To produce molecules like DMT, dopamine, and endocannabinoids as internal medicine

The “placebo effect” isn’t a placebo.  
It is your **self-directed pharmacology**,  
activated by **meaning, belief, and intention**.

# 🌟 Final Thought

>When **DMT opens the gateway**,  
and **dopamine strengthens the bridge**,  
**belief and intention become the architects** of your healing.

You don’t need to find the healer.  
You *are* the healer — and always have been.

Your inner pharmacy is open.

*By Marca*

I started noticing it about a week ago. Subtle things at first — my girlfriend, Rhea, being quieter than usual. She’d jump a little whenever her phone buzzed. Her eyes were constantly scanning, like she was expecting someone to pop out of the shadows.

At first, I brushed it off. We all go through stress, right? I figured work was piling up or she was just having one of those weeks.

But last Thursday… something shifted.

She came over to my place around 10 PM. No hug, no smile, no sarcastic joke about my messy room. She just stood in the doorway, pale and shaking, like she’d just walked out of a nightmare.

I asked what was wrong. At first, she didn’t answer. She just stared at the floor. Then finally, in the quietest voice, she said:

**""I think someone’s following me.""**

I froze. Rhea’s not dramatic. She’s tough, logical — the kind of person who laughs at horror movies and walks home alone without a second thought. If she said something like that, it meant she was genuinely scared.

She told me it started earlier in the week. Same guy. Every time. She’d seen him outside her apartment building, then again outside the coffee shop she visits every morning. The third time was on the train — he sat across from her but didn’t get off at any stop. He never approached. Never even moved. Just stared.

Same clothes. Same blank face. Every time.

I offered to call the police, but she said there wasn’t anything they could do. No crime, just a guy being “present.” Creepy, sure — but not illegal.

That night, I insisted on walking her home. We took a longer route, stayed under streetlights. I kept looking around for someone suspicious, anyone who might be lurking.

But nothing happened. No one followed us. She seemed calmer by the time we reached her door. I told her to text me as soon as she got inside, and she did.

I thought that was the end of it.

Until I got home.

It was just after midnight when I reached my apartment. I noticed something stuck to my door.

A photo.

My heart dropped as I pulled it off.

It was Rhea. Standing at a bus stop. The exact same clothes she wore earlier that day. It was taken from behind — and close. The photo had a slight blur, like it had been taken in a hurry, maybe from a moving car or through a window.

And in the corner of the frame… was me.

Half-turned. Looking the other way.

Whoever took that photo was right behind us the whole time.

Close enough to touch us.  
Close enough to know where we live.  
Close enough to leave a message — without saying a word.

I don’t know who he is.  
I don’t know what he wants.  
But I know one thing:

He’s not just watching **her** anymore.

He’s watching **me**, too.",1,1751887889.0,shortscarystories,0,0.67,False

What began as a casual habit quickly turned into something more serious. I became a chain smoker. At some point, I switched to vaping, thinking it would help me cut down. It didn’t. Eventually, I went back to cigarettes. Last year, I felt ready to quit. I had the motivation. I genuinely wanted to stop. But it’s hard to stay committed when most of the people around you still smoke. It’s not just about willpower, it’s about environment, routine, and everything tied to the habit. Recently, I decided to try nicotine patches. I started with the 21mg patch, as recommended. At first, it felt like it was working. There was a strange clarity in my head, like my brain was adjusting in a good way. But the cravings didn’t completely go away. Simple things like drinking coffee would trigger them. Even if I tried to keep myself busy, the urge would eventually creep back in. I stopped using the patch for now. I didn’t want to waste it while I was still smoking. And the truth is, I haven’t fully stopped. I still smoke every day. Deep down, I want to quit, I think about it constantly. But so far, the cravings are stronger than my efforts to resist them. I live in Saudi Arabia, where a pack of Marlboro Reds costs about 25 riyals. I go through a pack a day, sometimes more. It’s expensive. It adds up.

He gets up before me, so I got up and checked the fridge and started drinking my iced coffee, thinking he just decided not to get food bc we should eat what we have at home. I notice a bank notification on my phone for $16, which is more than 2 coffees, so I casually asked him a about it and he said he got 2 breakfast sandwiches and ate both. We usually each get one when we go there and I'm on my period so I was reeeally craving that sandwich lol. 

My feelings are hurt because he let his binge eating problem place higher above doing something kind (fair?) for me this morning. A week or so ago he guiltily/jokingly confessed to almost eating both sandwiches he bought on the way home and not telling me, and I told him that would've been mean. He just straight up did that this morning 😐 Maybe I'm being sensitive because I've had a rough week, but it feels shitty to know that he bought me something but decided to eat it on the way home and not tell me. It's just selfish in a way that I've not experienced from him before. 

Edit: My husband has struggled with disordered eating for damn near his whole life. He has *never* done anything like this before. Being selfish is very out of character for him, which is why this was so shocking to me. He buys me breakfast every Friday morning even when he doesn't want anything himself.

1ltrm57,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialOpinions/comments/1ltrm57/walkable_cities_arent_all_that/,Walkable cities aren't all that,"As someone who lives in a very walkable city parking is a huge issue where I live to the point that you need to pay 2 different permits to park on your own street. For this reason I don't have a car, and while I can rely on public transport to get around the city and even the country I am missing a certain freedom. 


The benefits of a walkable city are also only attractive to a certain type of person. The type that goes out for coffee during the day and browses the local galleries (in other words unemployed) or the type that gets off work, gets drunk in the city and walks home. Most others like myself will simply wake up, go to work, go home and repeat, occasionally taking a trip somewhere on the weekend. This is not so different to being confined to your suburb. 


To illustrate this further I'll give an example, grocery shopping. I walk 8 minutes to the nearest food store and have to carry the bags home. I see beautiful old churches, green spaces, and homeless people all around me but I do not interact with the world. I simply walk there and back. In my opinion this is no better than driving 10 mins (to a large store that has more choice mind you). It is part of the monotony of daily life, and nothing can make that more romantic.

""Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!""  
  
A man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.   
  
Noelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.  
  
Her eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.   
  
Next to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl\*\*d.   
  
Yet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.   
  
""You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!"" Gerard snapped.   
  
Utterly disgusting?   
  
Noelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch\*\*t. ""I didn't--""  
  
Before she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. ""How dare you talk back!""  
  
The glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.   
  
Noelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.   
  
Thin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl\*\*d.   
  
But Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.   
  
This wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.   
  
""Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,"" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.  
  
""She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.""  
  
Gerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.  
  
""Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!""  
  
""But Gerard...""  
  
""That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.""  
  
""I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...""  
  
Seeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.   
  
Gerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl\*\*ding.   
  
Did he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl\*\*d--might also be concerned about her looks?   
  
Noelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.  
  
Later on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.   
  
After fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.  
  
""What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl\*\*d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?""  
  
Noelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.   
  
Two years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.   
  
Jeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.   
  
She even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.   
  
For two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.   
  
She always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.   
  
She truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.   
  
But all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.   
  
One day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. ""If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.""  
  
If only Noelle had died out there?   
  
Those words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.   
  
Why? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?   
  
What made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?  
  
And if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?   
  
She closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.   
  
That was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.   
  
When Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.   
  
A strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.   
  
He raised his palm, ready to sl\*p her, and warned, ""If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!""  
  
But before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.   
  
It was Noelle.   
  
She had stopped him.   
  
""You--"" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.  
  
She'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?   
  
Noticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.  
  
""I said I didn't push Willa.""  
  
Gerard looked shocked. ""Still lying? You've got some nerve!""  
  
""Gerard,"" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.  
  
""If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.""  
  
""What did you say?"" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.   
  
""You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b\*\*t!""  
  
He refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.   
  
On the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.  
  
But when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.   
  
Proof? What kind of proof could she have?   
  
Still, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. ""Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--""  
  
""Stop defending her!"" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. ""I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!""  
  
Noelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.   
  
Willa's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.  
  
A voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?   
  
Noelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.   
  
There was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. ""Noelle, what do you think of this spot?""  
  
Gerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.   
  
Then came another voice. Calm, light. ""Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?""  
  
Gerald knew that was Noelle's voice.   
  
The next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.  
  
""Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?""  
  
**Chapter 2 Could It Be Him?**

Gerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.   
  
Willa--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?   
  
Willa's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. ""Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!""  
  
But the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.   
  
Next came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. ""Willa, are you sure you want to do this?""  
  
Willa's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. ""Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.""  
  
Then, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.  
  
""Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!""  
  
Gerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.  
  
Noelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.   
  
Noelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.   
  
Gerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch\*\*t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. ""Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?""  
  
Noelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.   
  
""Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.""  
  
""I..."" He opened his mouth, but no words came.   
  
It hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.   
  
And what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.  
  
Instead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl\*\*d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.   
  
Shame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.   
  
Willa's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.   
  
""Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.""  
  
His brow creased. ""What are you talking about?""  
  
Noticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.   
  
Her expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.   
  
""I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!""  
  
The sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.   
  
Now, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.   
  
He looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. ""Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.""  
  
Noelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch\*\*t.   
  
Her own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.   
  
It was absurd.   
  
She couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.   
  
Gerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.   
  
""Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!""  
  
Noelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.   
  
""You don't have to kick me out,"" she said. ""I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.""  
  
Without another word, she turned and walked toward her room.   
  
How ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.   
  
She packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl\*\*d.   
  
There wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.   
  
She changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.  
  
When Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.   
  
His face twisted with rage. ""Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!""  
  
Noelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. ""I won't regret it.""  
  
Willa stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!   
  
With her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.   
  
Still, she kept her face carefully controlled.  
  
Bubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, ""Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?""  
  
""Let her go,"" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. ""She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.""  
  
Just then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.   
  
He barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.   
  
She had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.   
  
The bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. ""Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!""  
  
The Martin family?   
  
Gerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.   
  
The Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.   
  
Sure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.   
  
The Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.   
  
For years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.   
  
And now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?   
  
""Quick, let's go welcome them!"" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.   
  
Willa followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.   
  
She couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?

**Chapter 3 Her Future Husband**

Gerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.   
  
Just as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.   
  
When Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.   
  
There was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.   
  
Ethan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.   
  
For Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.   
  
A wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.   
  
""Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!""  
  
He stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.   
  
What was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.   
  
Willa stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. ""Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?""  
  
Still nothing. No sound. No movement.   
  
Gerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.   
  
There was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.   
  
The tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.   
  
Gerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.   
  
Gerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.   
  
Ruben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.   
  
Once he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. ""Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--""  
  
But Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.   
  
That moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.   
  
Ruben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. ""Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.""  
  
Levi Martin?   
  
Hearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch\*\*t. So it was Levi.   
  
Though she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.   
  
Levi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.   
  
Ruben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.   
  
Since the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. ""Thank you.""  
  
""You're very welcome, Miss Moss,"" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.   
  
He placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. ""Miss Moss, please.""  
  
Noelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.   
  
A man.   
  
He sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.   
  
In his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.   
  
At the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.   
  
Noelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.   
  
""I'm Ethan Martin,"" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. ""I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.""  
  
Ethan Martin?   
  
The name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.   
  
Jeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.   
  
And now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?   
  
She slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.   
  
Gerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.   
  
They'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?   
  
The whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?   
  
Willa's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.   
  
But this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.   
  
Meanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.   
  
But all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.   
  
God, she hoped he didn't.   
  
The whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.   
  
But Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.   
  
He looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. ""I remember.""  
  
Noelle's heart skipped.   
  
Of all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.   
  
To put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.   
  
Even though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.   
  
Jeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.   
  
Naturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.   
  
As kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.   
  
Back then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.  
  
But as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.   
  
Ethan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.   
  
His words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.   
  
Their arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.   
  
By high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.   
  
When Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.   
  
She'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.   
  
After that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.   
  
She hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.   
  
He'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.   
  
**Chapter 4 Get Married Today**

The cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.   
  
Noelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.  
  
Instead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b\*te mark.   
  
Noticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. ""A little wild kitten gave me that.""  
  
Noelle blinked speechlessly.   
  
Ethan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. ""Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.""  
  
Once again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?   
  
That scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.  
  
In a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.   
  
She hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.   
  
Why hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b\*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?   
  
Feeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.   
  
Ethan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.   
  
The air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.   
  
But the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.   
  
Ethan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. ""What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b\*ting me again?""  
  
Noey.   
  
The nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.   
  
She couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.   
  
Wait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?   
  
Before she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.   
  
The tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.   
  
Looking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.   
  
Farther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.   
  
The whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.   
  
They stopped in front of a grand fountain.   
  
There, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.   
  
His silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.   
  
Even after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.   
  
The moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. ""Levi, I've missed you so much!""  
  
""Noelle! My sweet girl!"" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. ""I've waited so long for this moment.""  
  
""How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?"" she asked.  
  
""Don't you go worrying about me now."" He looked at her affectionately. ""This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.""  
  
Noelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.   
  
She had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.   
  
But it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.   
  
Levi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.   
  
He passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. ""Come on, let's head inside and talk.""  
  
Inside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.   
  
A maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.   
  
Levi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.  
  
""My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.""  
  
His words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. ""Levi...""  
  
""There, there."" He gave her hand a gentle pat. ""You've had a tough time these past two years.""  
  
Then, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.   
  
""You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.""  
  
Of course she remembered.   
  
Noelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.   
  
Ethan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.   
  
His face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.  
  
Without a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.   
  
Levi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, ""So, what do you think of Ethan?""  
  
The question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.   
  
And from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.   
  
Still, Levi wouldn't let it go. ""Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?""  
  
Noelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, ""He's... fine.""  
  
Ethan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.   
  
Then, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.   
  
Levi's face, however, lit up. ""Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.""  
  
Noelle stared at him, puzzled. ""Levi... what do you mean?""  
  
Laughing warmly, Levi said, ""Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?""  
  
Her jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, ""Levi, that's way too sudden!""  
  
Levi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.   
  
""Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.""  
  
Noelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.   
  
She instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.   
  
Surely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.

My (36F) worst AS damage is in my SI joints and it's the central hub for most of my pain. I also had a prolapsed disc (not totally related) removed from L5-S1 via microdiscectomy about 2 years ago.

I'm seeing a gyno this week about a pretty bad ""everything"" prolapse (uterus, bladder and rectum) due to the forceps assisted delivery of my son 6 years ago. I had seen a gyno previously who did an ultrasound and determined that all three organs were involved, but he didn't really offer any treatment apart from ""lose weight and drink less coffee"". I lost 22kg and it got worse :) 

So I'm looking to discuss possible surgery with the new gyno, and one of the strong options is a sacrocolpopexy, where a mesh is attached to the sacrum to support the uterus. I really worry about whether this will add pressure/pull in some way to my SI joints and can't really find much anecdotal evidence either way. Obviously will discuss this concern with gyno but I'm not expecting them to know much/anything about AS. 

I do plan on trying a pessary first before jumping to surgery but I'm fairly sure the prolapse is past the point where that might help.",1,1751887168.0,ankylosingspondylitis,1,1.0,False
1ltrjlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ltrjlk/my_weight_loss_journey_since_sept_2024/,My weight loss journey since Sept 2024,"Bit of a background: I’m 35 F who gained a lot of weight due to having three pregnancies (with the second pregnancy ending in a miscarriage due to a tumor behind my ovaries).

The pregnancies messed up my hormones SIGNIFICANTLY to the point where I gained 66 lbs (30 kgs) over a period of 6 years. 

Before I got pregnant, my weight was hovering around 126 lbs. Me being a 5’2 shorty, I was at the right weight at that time. 

After the birth of my daughter last year, something in me clicked where I completely overhauled my lifestyle. 

I stopped breastfeeding after my daughter turned 6 months old, so around September 2024. My starting weight when I started my journey was 165 lbs

Fast forward to now, I am now at a healthy weight of 121 lbs! 

In terms of diet, I’ve cut out sugar from my daily caloric intake. I drink water, unsweetened black coffee, and unsweetened ice tea.

I do intermittent fasting, and I only eat between noon to 7-8 pm. I still eat everything, but the thing that I have been very mindful of is my portion control and having a sense of how much calories I consume. 

I have also upped my exercise regime since I’ve stopped breastfeeding as I have more energy to do so. In a single week, my workout looks like this:

- Mondays: I do padel coaching for one hour, I usually burn around 200-280 calories 

- Tuesdays: one hour of tennis. A combination of drills and rallies. My active calories burned would range between 300-380 calories

- Wednesdays: one hour of doubles tennis. I burn less calories here, but it would usually net me around 200 ish active calories

- Thursdays: same as Tuesdays

- Fridays: Two hours of solo tennis coaching. This would net me the most active calories burned. Depending on the amount of effort I put in, it can range between 600-700 active calories 

- Saturdays: Strength Training/ Weightlifting. Back squats, Deadlifts, Front squats, cleans etc usually one hour sessions (I don’t really track calories burned really)

Sundays are my rest day. I usually just walk and try to keep somewhat active but nothing too strenuous. 

Based on my activity level, my TDEE is around 1,900 calories a day but I try to eat slightly below that as I know I love my cheat days. 

All in all, it’s been a long but VERY rewarding journey. Do I still slip up here and there? Heck yeah!

But I don’t punish myself when I do, and I still try to enjoy myself on holidays.

For those of you still in your weight loss journey, please don’t give up. The key is to enjoy the exercise that you do, and pick a time of the day where you know the likelihood of it being disrupted is minimal. God knows I love my tennis 😂 for me, waking up to play tennis is a joy and not a chore or a workout. I also exercise in the mornings between 6-8 am before the kids are awake and before work. 

Food is not your enemy but something that you should enjoy. The key is moderation and making healthier choices. Stick to a plan that you know is sustainable long term. ",1,1751887116.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

[China's tightening grip on its rare earths sector](https://energynews.oedigital.com/fossil-fuels/2025/07/07/chinas-tightening-grip-on-its-rare-earths-sector)

https://preview.redd.it/a3tq292cffbf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b59d3278803013564f380b81245a9754c0c95623

When China restricted [rare earth exports](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/rare-earth-exports) to Japan in 2010 during a diplomatic spat, a wild west domestic industry undermined Beijing with rampant smuggling.  
  
In a sharp shift that reflects how China has massively tightened control over the sector since then, when it imposed new restrictions in April this year, automakers worldwide faced shortages within two months leading some to pause production.  
  
Through consolidation and quotas, Beijing has turned a once-unruly sector, responsible for 90% of [rare earth processing capacity](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/rare-earth-processing-capacity), into a powerful source of diplomatic leverage.

Here is a summary of how the world's number one rare earth producer has tightened its grip over the industry.

# CONSOLIDATION

When China began its crackdown on the sector some fifteen years ago, there were hundreds of miners and processors. By 2013 ten producers controlled almost all mining. Today, there are just two state-owned giants: China Rare Earth Group and China Northern Rare Earth Group High-Tech.  
  
The decade-plus process of consolidation gave Beijing greater oversight while also curbing some of the environmental damage caused by illegal and reckless mining, according to David Abraham, affiliate professor at Boise State University, in Idaho.  
In the past an illegal supply chain of rogue miners delivered ore to unauthorized separation facilities, with the finished products then disguised and shipped abroad.  
  
Roughly 40,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides were estimated to have been smuggled overseas in 2014, half as much again as official exports.  
Magnet makers, however, have not consolidated in the same way as the upstream mining and refining sector, with dozens of producers and processors across China, including JL Mag Rare-Earth and Ningbo Yunsheng.  
  
However, China introduced a tracking system for its rare earth magnet sector from June, requiring companies to submit information including customer details and transaction volumes. It ultimately aims to track the entire supply chain.

# QUOTAS

In conjunction with consolidation, China has also used its production quota system, introduced in 2006, to control supply.  
  
The quotas cover mining, smelting and separation. Typically issued twice a year, they are widely monitored as a barometer for global supply.  
  
Beijing has gradually narrowed access to quotas and in 2024, only the two state-owned groups were eligible, compared to six previously.  
  
China has dramatically slowed down supply growth from 2024 when the total mining output quota grew only 5.9% year-on-year, versus an annual rise of 21.4% in 2023.  
  
Analysts and traders expect mining output quotas this year to either stay flat or rise by up to 5% from 2024's level.  
  
**Beijing also restricts exports of technology. The tools and means to extract and separate rare earths have long been banned. In late 2023 it extended that ban to the technology used to make rare earth magnets.**

# JULY 7th, 2025~China's export controls on rare earths are bad for business, but good for Beijing

[China's export controls on rare earths are bad for business, but good for Beijing](https://energynews.oedigital.com/mineral-resources/2025/07/07/chinas-export-controls-on-rare-earths-are-bad-for-business-but-good-for-beijing)



China's export restriction on rare earths has brought the global auto supply to a standstill and the U.S. president Donald Trump to the negotiation table. They're a major headache for businesses in the United States, who are already suffering from a slowing economy.

Beijing cut rare earth and magnetic exports in April as a retaliation to U.S. Tariffs. This has led to a drop in magnet makers' overseas sales, at a time when they are also facing pressure from an economy that is weak and EVs, one of their main markets.

Even after the U.S. announced on June 27, a deal with China to restart rare earths production, it is unlikely that magnet makers will see any relief anytime soon.

In a WeChat post 12 hours after the announcement, Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange (a state-backed trading site) noted that stock was piling up at warehouses.

Export curbs caused a 75% decline in magnet exports within two months of the restrictions being imposed, and several automakers were forced to temporarily halt production.

In May, Baotou Exchange, located in Inner Mongolia and one of China's rare-earth hubs, stated that the restrictions had caused a crisis for local magnet manufacturers.

Public filings reveal that while China consumes 90% of rare earth magnets worldwide, exports will range from 18% to 50 % of revenue by 2024 for the 11 largest publicly traded magnet producers based on capacity.

Ellie Saklatvala is the head of metal prices at commodities information provider Argus.

They have temporarily lost a large part of their clientele, and there is no guarantee that they will ever regain this customer base.

Few major listed companies that deal with rare earths have directly commented on how the controls may affect their business.

Two rare earth magnet manufacturers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of this issue, said that revenue was expected to drop in 2018.

It's difficult to say how much we will lose for the moment, but it will be a big impact on our export business,"" said one rare earth magnet producer, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.

According to a second source who declined to give their name, small and medium sized producers reduced production by 15% between April and May.

# EXPORT CURBS IMPACT UNDERESTIMATED

China's rare-earth magnet manufacturers are also victims of their own success, much like the U.S. chipmaker Nvidia.

In April, after the announcement of export restrictions, the share prices of listed magnet manufacturers plummeted. They were caught in the geopolitical crossfire between Washington's tariffs on imports and China's response. They have recovered from their lows in the last three months.

Cory Combs is the head of Trivium China's critical mineral research. He said that there was no reasonable forecast for the future of this industry.

He said: ""I can see different market outlooks that are more or less positive depending on assumptions. But none of them result in a sustained rise in the share price as we are seeing.""

He said that many magnet manufacturers are also privately owned, and therefore share prices can only give a limited picture.

Many producers were already facing weaker conditions in their home countries, such as a price battle among electric vehicle manufacturers, a key segment of customers, which has seen manufacturers demanding discounts from suppliers.

Four sources, who spoke anonymously, said that the highly customized nature of magnet products made it difficult to resell them domestically. This forced magnet makers to keep the cargos in storage while they waited for licenses.

# CONSOLIDATION MAY BE IMPACTED BY DIFFICULTIES

In its annual report, released late April, Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co reported the export restrictions and warned that export revenues could fall if the global situation worsened.

Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics announced last week that it had obtained export licenses, and that production was as usual. Investors are referred to the upcoming financial filings of Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics for more specific results.

According to Argus, Saklatvala, a return to the old status quo will be unlikely if rare earth controls are implemented similarly to those for other critical minerals such as germanium and Antimony.

China implemented export controls on antimony and germanium in 2023 and 2024. Customs data show that despite the fact that most of these materials are used by civil industries which should have no problem obtaining licenses in theory, exports still haven't recovered.

Europe receives only a fraction of the antimony that it imported from China prior to export controls being imposed in September last year. These shortages have already caused major problems for the lead-acid batteries commonly used in gasoline engines.

Saklatvala said that, ""looking at China's recent controls on exports of other critical minerals such as antimony"", it was clear that exports can take longer to normalize and resume than anticipated.

David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University in Idaho, says that the large amount of information requested by authorities is a permanent change to the industry, which will cause delays and increase costs for producers.

He said that ""in a sense, it's impossible to go back.""

He said that in an industry with hundreds of manufacturers the pressures may lead to a consolidation.

""I don't know if Beijing views that as a negative thing because more consolidation is helpful to control and understand where materials go.""

# JULY 5th, 2025~China’s rare earth dominance threatens West’s clean energy and security future

[China’s rare earth dominance threatens West’s clean energy and security future - BLiTZ](https://weeklyblitz.net/2025/07/05/chinas-rare-earth-dominance-threatens-wests-clean-energy-and-security-future/)

https://preview.redd.it/i60dk7hxhfbf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=de47ea18335c521355574b07baf2c5260b03f81b

In a rare moment of cooperation amid an era of intensifying rivalry, China and the United States last week reached a temporary agreement to ease some restrictions on the export of rare earth elements. Under the arrangement, Beijing will issue six-month export licenses for critical minerals and magnets-materials that had been tightly restricted since April. The move comes after months of global shortages that disrupted industries from electric vehicles (EVs) to renewable energy to defense production.

At first glance, this deal offers a measure of relief to global supply chains. But the uneasy compromise is no fairy-tale ending. It reflects a deeper, structural dependency of the West on Chinese control over rare earths-an arrangement that may prove politically dangerous and economically costly as the world’s energy transition accelerates and geopolitical tensions deepen.

Rare earth elements (REEs)-a group of 17 metals with unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties-are essential to the technologies of the future. Neodymium and praseodymium power magnets in EV motors and wind turbines. Lanthanum and cerium are used in battery technologies. Dysprosium improves heat resistance in motors, while europium is vital for energy-efficient lighting. Without these materials, large segments of the climate economy grind to a halt.

That’s why China’s dominance in this sector carries such weight. While it produces 70% of the world’s rare earth minerals, it controls more than 90% of global processing capacity. This isn’t just about geology-it’s the result of decades of state-driven investment, industrial strategy, and environmental tolerance for the heavy pollution associated with REE extraction and refining.

The West, meanwhile, outsourced much of this activity decades ago, in part due to the environmental costs and regulatory burdens. Now, as Europe and the US rush to decarbonize their economies, they find themselves caught in a trap: the cleaner the energy goals, the deeper the reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains.

The latest agreement between Washington and Beijing reveals a delicate balancing act. To regain access to key rare earth exports, the US reportedly agreed to soften certain tech-related export controls and relax visa restrictions on Chinese researchers. While both sides benefit in the short term, the arrangement underscores a broader and increasingly precarious dependency.

Crucially, the deal excludes military-grade materials, a reminder that China’s export controls are not simply economic tools but levers of strategic power. Beijing has repeatedly signaled its intent to limit the use of Chinese-made components in weapons systems aimed at containing or threatening Chinese interests. In this light, China’s REE policy is not only about industrial policy-it is a matter of national security.

The stakes are especially high for the renewable energy sector, where rare earths underpin virtually every component of a clean energy infrastructure. Wind turbines, solar panels, grid storage, and EVs all depend on specific REEs. As nations adopt aggressive climate targets, they risk deepening their reliance on a single supplier-one that does not share their political priorities.

Efforts to diversify supply chains are underway. Australia, Canada, and even parts of Africa are being explored as alternative sources. However, experts agree that building mining and refining capacity outside of China will take at least a decade. Add another decade to account for environmental regulations, permitting delays, and geopolitical complications. And then there’s the not-so-small problem of processing: mining alone is insufficient without the ability to refine these materials at scale.

Moreover, the environmental cost of ramping up REE production in the West could be steep. Rare earth mining generates toxic and radioactive waste, contaminates water sources, degrades land, and emits significant greenhouse gases. Ironically, the race to build a cleaner world could result in a wave of new pollution-just shifted from one geography to another.

Some analysts point to technological innovation and recycling as a way out of this dependency. Research is underway to develop synthetic alternatives or improve the efficiency of rare earth usage. Meanwhile, recycling programs aim to reclaim REEs from old electronics, batteries, and motors. But these approaches are still in their infancy. Large-scale REE recycling is neither economically viable nor technologically mature at this point. Even under optimistic projections, an independent REE supply chain may not materialize before 2040-if at all.

The same applies to innovation: replacing rare earths in high-performance applications is extremely difficult. Their unique properties are hard to replicate, and alternative materials typically fall short in power, weight, or durability. For the foreseeable future, there is no real substitute.

Perhaps even more concerning than the energy implications is the vulnerability of Western defense industries. In 2023, then-CEO of Raytheon, Greg Hayes, bluntly admitted that the company had “several thousand suppliers in China,” and that decoupling was “impossible.” That’s not just a logistical challenge-it’s a strategic liability. Military aircraft, radar systems, missiles, and precision-guided weapons all rely on REEs.

If tensions with China escalate further-say, over Taiwan-the West could find itself scrambling for components that underpin its deterrence capability. The uncomfortable reality is that the same country identified as a strategic competitor by NATO and the US Pentagon is also indispensable to their defense supply chains.

Through its rare earth dominance, China has positioned itself as a kingmaker in both the climate and security arenas. In effect, it holds leverage over the two most strategically important sectors of the 21st century. For now, Beijing appears content to maintain this leverage without fully weaponizing it. But that restraint may not last forever.

Beijing has already framed its export controls as a legitimate measure to prevent Chinese materials from being used in foreign military systems aimed at encircling or threatening China. But what if China’s domestic needs begin to outstrip supply? As its economy grows and energy demands rise, it may simply decide to prioritize its own development-at the expense of Western industries.

What is most striking in this ongoing saga is how quietly the West has acquiesced to this dependency. In pursuit of climate goals, Europe and the US have locked themselves into a green transition dependent on a geopolitical rival. In pursuit of profit, defense firms have deepened their commercial integration with Chinese suppliers. And in the name of “efficiency,” policymakers have allowed the critical infrastructure of the future to be built on unstable foundations.

In this light, the current deal may be a pragmatic step-but it is also a reminder of how little leverage the West truly has. The only path forward involves long-term investment in domestic supply chains, deeper partnerships with trusted allies, a realistic reassessment of environmental regulations, and accelerated innovation in both materials science and recycling.

But none of that will happen overnight. Until then, Western economies will remain vulnerable to the political decisions of a single state-one whose strategic ambitions may not always align with their own. And as the energy transition accelerates, that vulnerability will only grow more acute.

1ltrdme,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ltrdme/the_rise_of_the_unwanted_girl_i_can_take_you_home/,"The Rise Of The Unwanted Girl:   ""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?........","# 1.Chapter 1 Three Years' Punishment

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'

# 6.Chapter 6 Replace Her

The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.

When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.

The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.

Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""

Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""

Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""

Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue—but his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.

Athena understood then—he was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.

She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.

Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""

He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away—and truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.

""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""

Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""

Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""

Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""

""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""

""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.

Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone—very discreetly—to suggest replacing her in the engagement.

Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.

Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""

She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp—her reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.

Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off… They just want to marry someone else instead.""

Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.

It all made sense now.

Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.

But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow—pure, innocent Willow—would be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.

Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation—yet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.

No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them—she wouldn't give them that satisfaction.

""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""

Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.

""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.

Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.

But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""

At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.

Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.

The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made—so she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'

Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""

But she knew in her heart—Michael had been the best they could hope for.

With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.

Margaret felt a stab of grief—her precious Athena had endured too much.

But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""

""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""

She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.

Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.

As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""

Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""

""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.

Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly—Michael was standing right in front of her.

Backlit by the sunlight, he looked like a cold shadow descending upon her.

""Athena,"" he said, coming to a halt in front of her. His tall frame instantly blocked the sun.

The chill that radiated from him made her shiver. Even after three years, being this close still left a dull ache in her chest.

Suddenly, Michael seized her thin wrist, his voice low and icy. ""This engagement was settled years ago. You don't get to walk away from it.""

Funny enough we were both going to the same meetup group one night. He had asked me out before this but as we were going to the meetup it made sense just to meet there.

He had spoken to me at the start and end of the meetup, asked for my instagram and messaged me after the event. He said it was lovely meeting you then said hopefully I will see you at the next event. I asked ah arn't we catching before then? He said would you like to go for a coffee. I replied yes but he hasn't really arranged a day just talking about other topics.

The problem I'm having is he is taking a day to reply and I like a few texts throughout the day, not heaps just a couple. 

I have said to him that good communication is important to me and is there an easier app to talk on, he said instagram.

* 1 Indoor garage parking included
* 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, living room, dining room, kitchen

1ltr8ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ltr8ko/sins_of_our_ancestors_chapter_2_olivers_grimace/,Sins of Our Ancestors - [Chapter 2] 'Oliver's Grimace',"""The seeds of fate are sewn by the hands of every molecule in existence. One man's God is yet another's fallen angel.""

- Professor Phillip J. Covington, 1916, Miskatonic University

My father's favorite quote. He knew it better than he knew his own family. 

Maybe it was those words that helped keep my soul afloat as everything crumbled around me. Perhaps, it will be my only company at the end. Either way, I believe I understand its meaning a bit more clearly after that harrowing night.

A wiry tenor voice crackled over the phone as Oliver spoke the morning of our meeting. 

""Sparrow's Diner. Find me in the back. I'll pick a booth. Come alone."" 

The tension in his vocal cords reassured me of just how serious he was about all of this. I knew I could trust him... At least as far as this case goes.

The style of Sparrow's was a nice change from the surrounding architecture. It was antiquated, sure. But for what it lacked in modern amenities, it made up for with a rare and authentic  urban charm.

I found Oliver at the little mom-and-pop diner, several blocks away from Bleakmire Parish. He was already sitting in one of the greasy booths, tucked away in a corner, far from the few patrons dotting the establishment.

Cheap, knock off 50's decor lined the walls, and every table had one of those stained-glass light fixtures that hung by a thick wire, hovering just a little too low and dangling haphazardly above the silverware.

The hanging light droned on through out our awkward encounter, only taking breaks from buzzing when the electricity occasionally flickered out in short bursts. The smell of a fryer bubbling in the back of the restaurant fused with the powerful scent of stale black Colombian coffee.

Oliver tried his best to look inconspicuous under his short, ragged salt and pepper hair, drenched in perspiration. A maddened glint occasionally revealed itself at the corner of his eye.

He was closer to my age than my father's, although hit was hard to tell with his features completely worn down by stress. Even if his cheap black suit needed a good washing and proper ironing, I couldn't judge a man offering a helping hand.

Holding his head low, he saw me and mustered the bravado to give me a weak smile and a jittery wave. 

I sat across the table from him and his frantic facade faded in an instant. The man practically vibrated with nervous energy. His left hand visibly shook as he reached for what appeared to be his fifth cup of coffee.

I almost broke the tense silence several times as we stared at each other with an unspoken understanding of just how peculiar this situation was. 

Oliver wordlessly smacked an open palm on the table top. 

He quickly snapped his hand back to his side as if whatever he set on the table was about to explode at any second. 

Instead of a bomb, Oliver's hand revealed a simple silver ring, now lying on the table. Empty coffee mugs clanked into each other as his elbow retracted with a swift, shakey motion. 

His bouncing legs rattled the cups and saucers to the point where I could feel the whole table trying to wriggle free from under my arms.

Lanky fingers curled into a fist and he chewed on thin nails. He wanted me to confirm what we both already knew.

""This was Kenneth's."" 

I wish I could have mustered more sympathy for my father in that moment.

Oliver nodded quickly.

""Yes. It was the only thing I could take with me. It slipped off of his finger while I tried to save him. I wasn't fast enough."" 

Oliver's voice felt sincere, but his thousand yard stare gave him the appearance of a pale wraith, come to enact a punishment for some unknown transgression. His eyes did not see me. They stared right through me.

He pushed the ring forward.

Bile splashed onto my tongue and I fought back the urge to vomit as a wave of emotions struck me with mental projections of my father's blood smeared corpse.

I could smell bacon frying in the back room, its nauseating sizzle haunting me as I looked down at the simple wedding band. It hurt deeply to see he still wore the matching half to Mom's ring, up until his dying breath.

I nodded, tenderly picking up the ring and enduring a pain that had been broiling up in my chest since I first walked into my newly inherited office. 

The trinket was chilling in my palm. 

I felt the shifted weight of responsibility from father to son for the first time in my life. I knew now that whatever Kenneth was doing here was worth dying for. At least, it was to him. Even if it was all in his head. 

Oliver's gaunt facial features practically tightened to fit his bones as he handpicked his next words carefully. His eyes kept flicking sideways to peek out the window. His nervous fingers tapped out an erratic tune as he continued to try and calm his nerves.

""I would imagine you're looking for answers, Mister Rooke... And it would practically eat away at my soul if I didn't attempt to stop you—""

""Don't even try.""

My own voice sounded foreign to me in that dimly lit diner. 

 Only the bartenders and God above have memorized both my voice and my poison. I barely even speak to them anymore, let alone with some stranger in a place like this.

Oliver shifted uncomfortablly in his cushioned booth bench. I sat back in mine, feeling the cool hard tabletop against the bottom of my folded hands. Its smooth surface helped ground my nerves, even if only for a moment. 

A young waitress came by and took my order for a coffee. Her curly red hair and bored eyes bobbed as she scribbled on her writing pad. Oliver waited until she was around the corner in the staff area to speak again.

""Ok, fine. I won't argue. I will say, however, you are willingly falling into the same trap as your father.""

I leaned forward without realizing it. 

""What the fuck do you mean by that?""

With a resignated sigh and a voice full of unease, he recalled the night my father died. 

""I went with Kenneth—excuse me, I went with your father that night to visit an old acquaintance of his at Saint Jacob's Church. We were ambushed.""

Oliver sipped on his cup of coffee, though it was clear that more energy was the last thing he needed right now. The man looked like he might jump out of his seat and flee at any moment. Instead, he held the table and continued:

""One of their leaders, Reverend Armond. He was our man on the inside, but his help was a ruse. He trapped us with something truly monstrous. Down in the tunnels.""

Recalling that night was causing physical pain to Oliver as he writhed in his chair with all the grace of a wounded wolf caught in the iron grip of a hunter's trap.

With an exasperated sigh, Oliver hissed a whisper that I barely caught over the humming of our tacky table lamp, the smell of his rancid breath only somewhat diluting my understanding of his words.

""The Sin Eaters,"" his hands fidgeted with some silverware still wrapped in a napkin, ""those bastards are always watching, don't you get it?!"" 

My mind took me back to that dreaded office, to those mad scrawlings in my father's case files. I began to suspect Oliver was just as far off his rocker as my old man.

Oliver finished his cup of coffee and physically yearned for the waitress to come back. He clinked the cup back on its saucer and put both hands on the table to lean in even closer. 

His timid demeanor collapsed under a newly found aggression that poured forth out of him as he forced himself to speak quickly and quietly.

""You want to find the Sin Eaters? Fine. You'll be doing it alone. I am never setting foot in that god forsaken place again. Do you understand? I'm not going back!""

Between interlocked fingers and gritted teeth, Oliver fought back a complete psychotic breakdown. He was barely winning the battle against his nerves.

""Did you bring that damned map?""

I was a bit taken aback that he knew anything about my father's possessions, but I pulled the folded up paper from my coat pocket and slid it past the menus and cups that populated our table over the course of the conversation. 

With a jolt, he pulled the map in, scribbling furiously at it. He was out of his seat by the time I realized he had pushed the map back over to me, a neurotic energy clearly contained within his movements. 

I didn't bother trying to get him to come back for more questions. The man's sanity was completely spent, devoured by whatever happened that fateful night. Instead, I looked at what my new acquaintance had written on my map.

 ""Rise again, K'thali Mata'rith. The question is Saint Jacob's.""

Below, he scratched in a message that I read and reread until it clicked:

""Search Bleakmire for the Dark Angel. That is where the devourers hide."" 

I cursed under my breath. I had no idea what the hell any of that meant. I stumbled my way out of the booth, my shoulder accidentally bumping the light fixture on the way up. 

""Hey—"" I tried to shout as Oliver passed through the door.

I slammed money for the coffees and a tip on the table without counting out the bills and made a mad dash for the door, hoping I might still catch him in the heartless streets of Arkham before I was cast into this insane situation on my own.

With a newfound sense of urgency, I ripped the frigid glass diner door open and stepped out into the inky black street. Steel light poles lined either side of the road, doing their best to fight against the harsh shadows of the late hour.

I caught a fleeting glimpse of Oliver as he took the first of what I suspect would have been many evasive turns around the corner of the diner, into a blackened alley. 

As I took my first step on the grimey and trash covered brick alley, I heard it.

A gutteral scream ripped across the quiet night sky. 

Pain and primal terror violently expelled from the lungs of my only ally thus far in this haunting task that lies ahead.

My mind scrambled into a kaleidoscope of twisting pressure that threatened to implode my skull in the wake of a drowning flood of volatile emotions. 

Shock overlapped anxiety and was completely smothered by a sense of intimidating awe that scraped the back of my thoughts with the raking claws of the unknown.

All the hairs on my neck became sharp as needles in the electric aftermath of the sudden realization that my father wasn't so crazy, after all.

I froze in place. Oliver's violent cry was dragged out into the muggy night air for several seconds, only to be cut short by the sound of something pulpy and wet being torn apart. The smell of decay and a coppery metallic tinge assailed my nostrils. 

Unnatural gurgling sounds eminated from just around the corner of the diner. A strange, almost sightless gas filled the air, leaving my tongue dry. 

""Oliver?"" I secretly hoped he would answer before I could act. 

Confusing sensations sent my imagination into orbit. I tried to calculate what living being on Earth could make a noise like that in between my thumping heartbeats.

A howling tailwind carried my running body to the edge of the alleyway with a speed fueled mostly by fear and caffeine. A mental fog of sleep deprivation was fighting to overcome my muscles as I sprinted around the corner of Sparrow's.

I halted to a stop at the edge of the void-like shadows that veil the alleyway. The faltering remnants of weak lamp light trickled into the damp brick alleyway and was repelled by a physical darkness that filled the space with an amoeba-like fluidity.

My eyesight plunged itself into a wall of shadow that wrapped the scene with a shroud that, even now, still casts doubt on my recollection of that night.

 Just at the edge of the light, a mound of what appeared to be dried leather was rustling and shaking as it was being dragged further into the unseeable darkness. 

I was a bit distracted by the overpoweringly sweet smell of decay that practically halted the breeze itself. The lump of brownish leather kept shaking just beyond the edge of my sight... Just outside of the light.

Like a fly larvae, the lump pulsated with an organic fluid-sac quality that made my skin tense up, clinging for dear life across my every bone.

As the leather continued to slither away, my eyesight adjusted to the night. I strained my eyes into a pursing squint, unable to propel my legs forward another step. 

In the abyss of that bleak alley, I could barely see round, wet, reflective orbs glistening just behind the lump of leathery dry flesh. The discarded leather crackled like old paint under a hot sun as it shrank lower and smaller against the brick pathway.

The taste of black coffee soured on my tongue as the silhouette of an animalistic mass appeared beneath the strange reflective orbs. 

A ragged, undulating form pulsed with an insatiablly wretched hunger that matched the rhythmic inhuman movements in the leather lump that withered to a small heap. 

Its body was the size of a large bear, and yet it did not resemble them in the least.

In the dark, I could almost see the long, thin tail as it scraped below a rusted dumpster. A body, thin like a fat snake wrapped in rotted human flesh, with four gangly limbs protruding out and holding itself up. Hands extended into long fingers that pressed tightly to the rough brick walls. 

A woman's head sat atop the being's elongated neck, completely shrouded by stringy black hair. A sinewy, ropey red fleshy arteries branched outwards from within the hair hung suspended in mid air. 

Horrific arteries continued to make a disgusting pressurized hiss until, with an unflattering pop and a wet fizzling, a vaporous mist was dissolved from the air around the pile of flakey leather.

The smell of burning flesh and hair made my stomach do somersalts as I tried to peer into shadows that thankfully hid that avatar of blasphemy's full image from my eyes.

My vision adjusted even more. A cheap black suit was shredded to pieces and discarded in tatters along the cold dried and crumpled leathery remains of Oliver. 

His face was almost wholly unrecognizable. A terrible mouth agape within the twisted remnants of dried and hollowed flesh. It only held onto its humanity by the look of unimaginable suffering that was permanently etched into his once screaming jaws. 

My eyes pierced the shadows in a last ditch effort to try and figure out just exactly what the fuck I was looking at... When it dawned on me that it was looking right back at me. 

Watching. 

Staring. 

Two soulless black eyes looked into mine from beneath the mess of greasy black hair, mimicking the reflective properties of the other bulbous orbs that were scattered across this demon of my nightmares, all of which were staring at me with the same hostile curiosity.

The proboscis of arteries retracted with the curling and melting of flesh. A thick, liquidy burbling sound, caught somewhere between sick elation and animalistic hunger, drove spikes of anxiety into my mind. 

I tried to glimpse anything else about the being. Anything at all.

Anything except those damned eyes.

I felt something within me call out to that thing as the sensation of my hallucinogenic states took over, the world around me shifting about like the start of a bad acid trip.

Its eyes stayed locked to mine and I could feel it somehow interacting with the waves of energy that rippled out from my body, something I had never witnessed in all my years. 

Silent and with an an almost surreal oozing quality, the thing bolted to the diner wall. It scrambled up the building with shaking, grasping palms that slapped with great force, echoing wet, meaty smacks from the alley and streets that expanded and contracted with slow, warm breaths until the end of my frantic sprint to the hotel. 

Every sound and reflection only sent me barreling that much harder down the empty streets of that freezing Arkham night. 

A seared image of clustered eyeballs draining the life force of my informant kept dashing my attempts at rationalizing what I had seen into the cracked concrete that crunched under foot. 

I took several wrong turns and avoided many shadow strewn shortcuts for fear of another ambush from that abomination of God and all creation. I sprinted until my muscles screamed in a hot pain that I couldn't ignore anymore, begging to be freed of their torment.

By the time I made it into my small hotel room and locked the bolts, I had lost myself to a vicious cycle of thought loops. I babbled in the fetal position on the grey shag carpet until sunlight reached my eyes in the morning, stuck in an illogical mental paradox.

I hid away in my hotel room for a few days, refusing to take even a single step into the hallway, especially when the sun went down. 

Each night, I could sense that thing's presence. Its gangly, hulking form roaming about the sewers or the rooftops, hidden deep within the veil of night. Anything that so much as skittered outside the walls of my room sent an avalanche of paranoia barreling down through my head. 

All food tasted spoiled, as if existing in the same world as that monstrosity was enough to warp my fate to fit its unknowable will.

I wasn't hungry panyways.

Eventually, I found enough shredded pieces of my own fragile sanity to leave my hotel room. I couldn't hide from this. I had to move forward. 

Without a second thought, I burst out into the hotel hallway, to a single bag of belongings over one shoulder. My trek down Arkham's barren roads felt like a constant battle of wits. Even in the morning sunlight, every shadow reached a little further out than they did the week before.

Above the city's many rooves and smokestacks, Saint Jacob's cathedral loomed tall. Truly a relic of the Catholic faith. Barely able to stand in its own shadow, it watches the modern day Gamorrah, and all its dark deeds. 

With a sinister stare, the combined legions of heaven and hell watched me from atop the cathedral walls and balconies, a heavy scorn buried in their eyes. I fought to remove their judging marble pupils from my sight. I was at least a mile or two away... yet when I locked eyes with one of them, I felt as if I were mere feet from their faces. 

Every time I looked upon that corrupted temple of God, I felt the infinite eyes of weather-worn statues pressing down on me. Visions of their arms swaying in steady unison, their eyes flooding the parts of space where stars dare not shine. 

No... No. I had to keep going. 

To spite my fear, the hallucinations, my father's killer... I pushed on. 

The world around me morphed sluggishly, taking on the appearance of pale red candle wax, slowly dripping to the brick and concrete walkways on either side of the street. 

Buildings beaded with fat globs of a scarlet material that rolled and slid down their slick surface like a cold sweat. That glossy, repulsive material piled up quickly, invading my nose with a pungence that reminded me of wet black mold.

""Slow deep breaths."" My voice trembled as I began my breathing exercises for calming my nerves.

In through the nose.

Out through the mouth.

The visions followed me all the way back to the office. Windows full of fleshy, sticky eyes rolling in their sockets appeared around every corner. It felt as if gravity itself constricted my lungs as I did my best to ride out the mental storm.

As I stumbled into my father's office, a surprisingly warm sensation of peace began to wash over the rabid fear that so badly wanted to drive me into a frenzy. 

His now familiar office space was already lit by candle light. I distinctly remember putting it out before I left... 

And yet, I felt at ease. A soft hum reverberated in my ears. The strong herbal scent of burnt sage grounded me in an instant.

I latched the bolt locks in place and just stayed there, breathing in controlled bursts and waiting to hear the slapping of palms approaching the door.

Instead, I finally noticed the symbols that were carved into the bookshelves and walls. They were glowing a yellowish-green light, rippling in the shadows that remain untouched by the candle's influence. 

Sigils that I couldn't comprehend before suddenly began to click as I took my time inspecting them. 

Each one was doing something slightly different, but they all worked together to create some sort of protection ward. 

Several bundles of burnt sage smoldered softly, sending miniature wisps of smoke flowing in all directions. Resting in a gold saucer, they helped reverberate the energy in the air.

I was safe... For a moment.

My father's desk reflected the small flame's glow. A forest green envelope lay atop the many files I left about. It held a golden symbol of an eye, a triangle for the pupil. The paper felt old, like it hadn't been handled in centuries. 

I opened the envelope. Inside was a letter, or more accurately, an invitation. Written in beautiful cursive with a red luminescent ink that caressed the old looking paper.

""Dear Mister Rooke,

I am so painfully apologetic to hear of your father's recent demise. 

Come by my place and I'll see if I can't help you find some answers.

P.S., Do some digging through Ken's rituals and spells. The old man isn't as mad as you think. 

With your bloodline, it might come naturally... Or it might not. 

After you rest for awhile, you will find me. On your way to Bleakmire Parish, we will cross paths. For now, let your spirit, sanity, and sanctity restore for awhile.

I know Arkham is a horrid place. But to me, it's home.

Good luck.""

—Clarabelle

The letter crunched between my fingers as the red ink all but glowed with a neon energy,  a similar vibrance to the green symbols that were set up in rows around the room.

 Deep red letters shone their light against my skin and left me feeling a sense of curiosity, despite the path ahead being so daunting. The taste of cigarette smoke hit my tongue before I could register that I was lighting one up. It was the first in days. 

A head rush hit me as the nicotine took my nerves and steadied them against the stacked odds.

My sight wandered past the symbols and furniture, across the desk... And onto my father's journal.

Amidst countless spells and recipes for protective concoctions, I found it:

Ward of Sanctuary. 

Was I truly ready to accept this reality? All I knew is I would find out the truth for myself. This case went far deeper than I could fathom at the time.

Maybe... I wasn't alone in all this. There were others to find. I would need as much help in this city as I could get.

Could I trust Clarabelle? Certainly not yet... But it's somewhere to start.

My Green Eyed Lover,

This is the most important thing I’ve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the heart. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn’t small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn’t know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years. 
Also just to be 100% honest what happened the next morning, truly was an accident!  I remember thinking, oh my god I just??  You know the rest of the story, so I will leave it at that!  

We weren’t thinking of falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected, something rare. We didn’t choose it. It chose us and it was love! This is not completely true, when I left your house that morning, yes! I was in love with you!

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. I had no idea unconditional love was something that could exist in my world, until you showed me. You showed me what unconditional love felt and looked like. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. I saw you and my god are you beautiful! I have never seen such Beaty, on the inside and absolutely the outside! I loved you unconditionally and without expectation, but I now see that even the deepest love can’t thrive without healing. And it wasn’t the love that failed, it was the unhealed parts of me that I hadn’t yet faced. That’s on me and I will forever be sorry for that!

Please hear this: I heard you. Every word you said. Every truth you offered, even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass. For the past four and a half months, I’ve been showing up twice a week, sitting with the mirror, letting my therapist walk with me through the wreckage and the reasons, the fears and the scars. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror that made me realize I had to change because I want to love the right way and I wanted to love you the right way! And because all I want, is for you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first woman I have ever truly, undeniably, and wholeheartedly loved. Not in a “forever sounds good” kind of way. But in the way that makes me certain!  Certain that I will marry you someday, if you allow me the honor? That if I die before you, my soul will stay with you, quietly holding your hand as you sleep. Because my love doesn’t end at death. It doesn’t even end at failure. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise on everything that matters to me, that if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, I will hold it like we both know it deserves to be held!  With kindness, softness, with certainty and with love! You will never hear my voice raised in anger, ever. Not once. The only thing that will separate me from you again will be my final breath. And even then, my love stays.

I want the life we almost had and so much more! With all seven of our children! With all the messy, imperfect, magical moments that come with blending souls and stories. To me, this is the perfect love. A perfect love, we both deserve! I want our love, unconditional love from both sides! I want the hard days, the belly laughs, the quiet mornings, the coffee in bed, the hand squeezes in the car, the hold you as you fall asleep, the forgiveness when we’re tired, the honesty when we’re scared, the deep knowing that we are no longer alone in this life.

This is not just my truth. This is me and you and it’s our truth. This is a chance to start new, with the communication we both desire and the love we both want. For you. God, for us. To what I know is the greatest love story ever told not because it’s flawless, but because it is absolutely real. And real love? It deserves to be fought for, it deserves to never be given up on, so it can rise. And sometimes, it deserves a second or third chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor, no ego, no games. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready to be loved!

If even a piece of your heart still remembers what we felt, I’m here. I am already home. All that’s missing is you, my true love.

Forever and Always

Forever and Alway(S)

1ltr4rx,https://i.redd.it/xoinqqdpnfbf1.jpeg,What Causes Yellow Teeth Even If You Brush Daily?,"Brushing twice a day is essential — but it’s not the whole story. If your teeth still look yellow, here’s what might be going on 

 **1. Natural Tooth Color**  
Some people naturally have slightly yellow dentin (the layer under enamel). Thin or worn enamel makes it show more — and that’s totally normal.

 **2. Staining Foods & Drinks**  
Coffee, tea, red wine, turmeric, and soda can stain your enamel — even if you rinse or brush after.

 **3. Smoking or Tobacco Use**  
Nicotine and tar are major culprits for stubborn yellow/brown stains.

 **4. Enamel Erosion**  
Acidic foods or aggressive brushing can wear down enamel, exposing the yellowish dentin underneath.

 **5. Genetics & Aging**  
As we age, enamel gets thinner. Plus, some of us are simply more prone to discoloration due to our genes.

 **6. Medications**  
Some antibiotics (like tetracycline) or excessive fluoride in childhood can lead to yellow or gray discoloration.

 **Want a brighter smile?**  
Try:

* Using a soft-bristle brush and non-abrasive whitening toothpaste
* Adding a straw for dark drinks
* Visiting your dentist for professional cleaning or whitening advice

I have really bad body image and probably an eating disorder but i have no time, strength or money for therapy. I really try my best to work on it but it's hard. Usually if I'm alone, i will else, forget to eat or chose not to or to eat very little. Most of the time i will ""block the hunger"" by drinking something, usually water or coffee, but because it's summer i often turn towards cold drinks, like lemonade or sirop in water.
My boyfriend knows about my ed and tries to help me. He knows i hate wasting food so he often make very nourishing meals when he's home so even if I don't eat for the rest of the day, i will have enough energy. But there's one thing that he's been doing for years and that I've told him i hate : eating pr drinking things without letting me have some. I'm venting today because :
Yesterday he bought two bottles of fuze tea, the first one he drank all of it with his friend and left me barely a sip of the bottle for when i come back from work, he made me taste the other which he stated he didn't like the flavor (mind you those are 1.5 L) i said i liled it so i would drink it and that it would taste good with fruity sirop.
Right now he cooked a meal and i wanted a glass of it so i asked if there was some meft and he said ""no"" i asked him why and he said ""oh can i not drink what i buy now ?"" And i said ""but you said you didn't like it and i wanted to try some with sirop like they do with bubble teas"" and he got mad, locked himself in the bathroom for a few minutes then came back, took his plate and left to eat upstairs alone.

This is not the first time this happened, usually he would leave just enough of a sip of a drink in the fridge and I would tell him that it's a dick move. Or he would drink a can he specifically said was mine/he bought for me
Or drink a whole carton of juice while knowing that some morning it's the only thing i will met in my body.
If I'm lucky i will get a glass of a drink before he gets all the bottle...
His excuse most of the time is that he's diabetic and will get low sugar levels in the night so he has to have a bunch. We have candies for that. Because when he's in that state he cannot taste anything, so candies we don't like, we keep them for this occasion and also, he doesn't care for his health, if he does 1 shot of insulin per day it's a miracle. He got blind and alsmost died multiple time because of it but he still doesn't care enough.
I never get to drink as much as him, he knows that if there's bothing for me to ""block my hunger"" i won't ingest anything at all but he keeps doing it. And now he's mad at me ? Because i only got a sip of a 1.5L bottle ?? That he bought yesterday ??? What a joke ! Sometimes i just wanna rip my hair out.

I am choosing between 2 places atm. Both flats. I’ve been in london for a month and hoping to move out in September.

Flat 1- £1150 roughly with bills. Slightly bigger room, my own bathroom but not en-suite. A little bit more choices with transport but no major difference. Gyms and all are nearby, Lidl is closer than Flat 2 😂. Flat has a balcony. I’ve met up with the flatmate for coffee and we seem to get along well- closer in age. 

Flat 2- £1100 including bills and free gym, sauna & swimming pool. En-suite. Living with landlord who is 22 years older than me. We’re both working in the same field. He seems pretty nice. He’s part of the lgbtq+ community.

My Green Eyed Lover,

This is the most important thing I’ve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the heart. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn’t small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn’t know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years. 
Also just to be 100% honest what happened the next morning, truly was an accident!  I remember thinking, oh my god I just??  You know the rest of the story, so I will leave it at that!  

We weren’t thinking of falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected, something rare. We didn’t choose it. It chose us and it was love! This is not completely true, when I left your house that morning, yes! I was in love with you!

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. I had no idea unconditional love was something that could exist in my world, until you showed me. You showed me what unconditional love felt and looked like. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. I saw you and my god are you beautiful! I have never seen such Beaty, on the inside and absolutely the outside! I loved you unconditionally and without expectation, but I now see that even the deepest love can’t thrive without healing. And it wasn’t the love that failed, it was the unhealed parts of me that I hadn’t yet faced. That’s on me and I will forever be sorry for that!

Please hear this: I heard you. Every word you said. Every truth you offered, even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass. For the past four and a half months, I’ve been showing up twice a week, sitting with the mirror, letting my therapist walk with me through the wreckage and the reasons, the fears and the scars. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror that made me realize I had to change because I want to love the right way and I wanted to love you the right way! And because all I want, is for you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first woman I have ever truly, undeniably, and wholeheartedly loved. Not in a “forever sounds good” kind of way. But in the way that makes me certain!  Certain that I will marry you someday, if you allow me the honor? That if I die before you, my soul will stay with you, quietly holding your hand as you sleep. Because my love doesn’t end at death. It doesn’t even end at failure. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise on everything that matters to me, that if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, I will hold it like we both know it deserves to be held!  With kindness, softness, with certainty and with love! You will never hear my voice raised in anger, ever. Not once. The only thing that will separate me from you again will be my final breath. And even then, my love stays.

I want the life we almost had and so much more! With all seven of our children! With all the messy, imperfect, magical moments that come with blending souls and stories. To me, this is the perfect love. A perfect love, we both deserve! I want our love, unconditional love from both sides! I want the hard days, the belly laughs, the quiet mornings, the coffee in bed, the hand squeezes in the car, the hold you as you fall asleep, the forgiveness when we’re tired, the honesty when we’re scared, the deep knowing that we are no longer alone in this life.

This is not just my truth. This is me and you and it’s our truth. This is a chance to start new, with the communication we both desire and the love we both want. For you. God, for us. To what I know is the greatest love story ever told not because it’s flawless, but because it is absolutely real. And real love? It deserves to be fought for, it deserves to never be given up on, so it can rise. And sometimes, it deserves a second or third chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor, no ego, no games. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready to be loved!

If even a piece of your heart still remembers what we felt, I’m here. I am already home. All that’s missing is you, my true love.

Forever and Always

Forever and Alway(S)

I want to ask how much of the dye would they pick up and is it necessary to bleach them beforehand to get something similar to a coffee/chocolate shade of brown (or does it depend on the dye that I use)?

Just want to share with you my situation. First, i haved lived in this apartment for almost 3 years here in Manila.

Swerte ko dito dahil included na Aircon, bedframe, waterheater and for a price of 10k sulit sya for me.

Upon staying here wala akong major appliances dahil tamad ako magluto and dahil late ako nauwi everyday, i just bought dinner outside na lang. I just use electric kettle for coffee and that's it. No washing machine, TV, etc.

During my first month here, napansin ko yung submeter dito sa apartment ay nakadigital so i think mukhang high tech and easier to read compared sa traditional meralco standard of meters pero ang electric bill ay kasama sa overall receipt (walang official meralco bill statement). And for a few months, sobrang mura ng bill ko parang hindi pumapatak kahit gumagamit ako ng Aircon,  i know naman na pag AC gamit mo matic tataas talaga bill mo pero sa payment receipt ko sa apartment parang wala akong nagastos talaga. 

So i reported it sa caretaker and ayun they thanked me for noticing so pinaayos nila. After that, they said fixed na and under monitoring sya. So sa next billing ki ayun ramdam ko na yung andar ng submeter so gumagalaw na talaga but still ang baba padin for someone na nag aaircon ng 8 hrs (lamigin kasi ako and sa gabi labg aki nagpapalamig talaga).

So eto na nga, kahapon naconfront ako ng caretaker dahil ang baba daw ng bill ko and they plan to charge me 2k for electricty for my next billings until maayos yung submeter daw kasi parang di nanaman daw gumagana nang maayos. Inaargue niya sakin na nagaabono daw yung landlord sa billing nila and bakit hindi daw ako nagrereport sa kanila for almost 3 years which is I find odd kasi sila yung nagssend sakin ng bill statement (rent, water / elec bill sa isang unofficial receipt parang nakalist down lang sya)

So sabi ko, bakit ang taas and iccharge nyo ko without basis tska bakit lumalabas na kasalanan ko na nagaabono yung landlord. I get it na loss of income sya sainyo pero di ako pwede maging liable sa mismanagement nyo kasi ngayon lang yan tinry ipaayos nung nalaman na ng landlord yung problema sa bills nya samin.

After that, argument kinausap ko ulit sya and sabi ko na i can pay yung 2k na yan until mafix yung submeter pero pwede banh mareimburse yung sobrang binayad ko once na nafix na to? And he said na depende daw sa decision ni landlord. So ipapayos muna nila ito for now pero walang kasiguraduhan kung kelan pa.

Ayun. I'm asking for your help po regarding sa liability and may hustisya ba ito for me and other unit owners sa kapabayaan nila?

We averaged about **£50/day per person**, covering *everything*: accommodation, food, transport, SIM cards, wine tastings, etc. That said, we weren’t super strict. We went to a few wine bars and nice restaurants, and didn’t track spending too closely. You could definitely do it for less.

We stayed in this [**Airbnb**](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/25593205?source_impression_id=p3_1751882902_P3bsSjbcf9WjoT8k) in Tbilisi, run by a lovely couple (Pata and his wife) and their very cute dachshund, Archbald. Clean, simple, great location, and they were incredibly helpful. We liked it so much we stayed twice.

You can pay by **card almost everywhere** in Tbilisi — cafés, restaurants, shops. We hardly needed cash in the city.

---

### 🍷 Kakheti Wine Tour
We booked [**this wine tour**](https://www.getyourguide.com/en-gb/tbilisi-l1379/tbilisi-kakheti-wine-region-tour-with-10-wine-tastings-t488105/?ranking_uuid=b6040a68-0956-4805-9de0-0c3edfe6815a&visitor-id=7B405CFADCFD40AF8D3D33E64E666C78&locale_autoredirect_optout=true) on GetYourGuide. It’s more of a drinking-and-chatting tour than a deep dive into wine, but it was fun and good value. We met some really lovely people and the scenery was beautiful.

---

### 🚆 Tbilisi to Mestia (for the hike)
We took the **daytime train** from Tbilisi to Zugdidi. It leaves at **8:20 AM** and takes about **6 hours**. Booked easily through [**tre.ge**](https://tre.ge/en?cmpn=TRE_Custom_ENG).

We upgraded to the comfier seats, which were slightly bigger, but honestly the regular seats seemed fine too.

There’s no food cart. At some stops people hop on selling bread and drinks, which helps, but we were glad to have packed snacks. Most cafés and shops don’t open early, so grab stuff the night before.

At Zugdidi, marshrutkas wait for the train. Walk to the end of the platform. They leave when full and the drive to Mestia takes about 4 hours, with a couple of toilet stops. The roads are twisty, but the views are incredible.

---

### ✈️ Alternative: Vanilla Sky Flights
[**Vanilla Sky**](https://ticket.vanillasky.ge/en/tickets) runs tiny propeller planes between Tbilisi and Mestia. Flights are about $16 but book up quickly and are very weather dependent. We skipped it, but could be great if it works with your schedule.

---

### 🏔️ Mestia is the last town with amenities
This is your last shot at:
- ATMs
- Paying by card
- Buying snacks or wine
- Pharmacies and shops

From Mestia onward it’s guesthouses only. Bring all the cash you need for the full hike.

---

### 🥾 Mestia to Ushguli Hike
We did it over 4 days (June 27–30). The weather was perfect but it had rained before and after. An unforgettable experience — highly recommend.

- **Fitness**: Moderate level needed. Day 3 is long and tiring.  
- **River crossing (Day 3)**: There's a strong glacial river. You can wade through (scary, freezing, doable with poles) or pay 25 GEL for a horse. Cross early, the water rises throughout the day.  
- **Water**: Tap water is drinkable everywhere  
- **Facilities**: All guesthouses had clean showers and toilets  
- **Booking**: We used Booking.com. There were spare rooms in late June, but it probably fills up more in peak season.

---

### 🛏️ Guesthouses
We paid around **150–220 GEL for two people**, dinner and breakfast included. Some places even let us wash our hiking clothes. All of them:
- Provided clean **towels**
- Let us take **leftovers from breakfast** for lunch (just ask, they'll give you a plastic bag)
- Had hot showers and comfy beds

Where we stayed:
1. [**Mushkudiani Manor — Mestia**](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ge/mushkudiani-manor.en-gb.html)  
2. [**Guesthouse Tanano / Dodo’s — Zhabeshi**](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ge/guesthouse-tanano.en-gb.html) — our favourite! Great food, great location  
3. [**Guesthouse Lolita / Zhora Kaldani — Adishi**](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ge/guest-house-lolita.en-gb.html) — really welcoming  
4. [**Raul / Lushnu Darbaz — Iprari**](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ge/lushnu-darbaz.en-gb.html) — least favourite, a bit of a detour and dinner wasn’t great

---

### 🎒 What to Pack
I follow the motto: one outfit to hike in, one to relax in, one to sleep in. Your hiking clothes will always be smelly, no point bringing more than you need.

Pack:
- Hiking trousers + merino top (for walking)  
- Outfit to relax in post-hike  
- PJs and underwear  
- Hiking boots  
- Lightweight sandals (Tevas, Crocs, flip flops — your feet will thank you)  
- Light fleece, down jacket, raincoat (hot in the day, cold at night)  
- Sunhat, suncream, sunglasses  
- Hiking poles (essential for the river and steep bits)  
- Blister plasters  
- Antibac  
- We washed our clothes in the sink and dried them overnight

---

### 🚌 Return Journey: Mestia → Kutaisi → Tbilisi  
On the way back, we broke up the journey by going to **Kutaisi** first. The marshrutka from Mestia to Kutaisi took around **5 hours** and was pretty straightforward.

The next day, we booked a coach to Tbilisi with [**CityBus**](https://citybus.ge/en). The coach was excellent — super comfy, felt safe, and they even gave out refreshments. Way nicer than bouncing around in another marshrutka.

---

### 🏙️ Tbilisi Tips
- Feels **super safe** day and night  
- The metro is deep and very Soviet, fun to ride  
- [**Bolt**](https://bolt.eu) is the best app for taxis  
- SIM card: We got Magti from Galleria Tbilisi (~£25 for 2 weeks, great coverage even in the mountains)

### 📍 Tbilisi Food & Drink
- 🍷 [Can Celeria Natural Wine Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/99HXiRDSP64E8cuWA) — amazing wine, knowledgeable staff  
- 🏨 [Stamba Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rDSJuRwsAN6PyePb7) — beautiful space, surprisingly affordable wine

- 🥙 [Racha Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2AvuWyFsMUNehSJr7) — budget-friendly and delicious

---

### 🇦🇲 Armenia Side Trip
We booked minivans to/from Yerevan via [**12go.asia**](https://12go.asia). It took about 5 hours each way, and cost around 50–80 GEL.

- Border crossing was fine heading in, slower coming back  
- Yerevan has a very different vibe — wide Soviet-style boulevards, more car-heavy  
- GG and Yandex (taxi apps) didn’t work well for us, so we walked or took the metro

Also: **drivers in Georgia and Armenia are a bit mad.** Overtaking on blind corners, speeding through bends, zero patience. We got used to it, but just a heads up if you get nervous in cars.

---

### 🛐 Cultural Notes
- Orthodox churches: Women need to cover their heads (a scarf or bandana is fine)  
- No need to tip unless it’s not already included (often it is)

---

### 🗣️ Language
- Younger people often speak English  
- Older people tend to speak Russian  
- Learning a few Georgian phrases goes a long way — people are genuinely warm once you engage

---

**TL;DR:**  
Georgia is amazing. Great hiking, great food, warm people, easy to travel around, and very good value. Do it.

Within the last 5-6 years I lost a loved one, lost friends, lost my dog and lost my job, health issues, relationship issues, family issues etc. so even simple things like picking up clothes, putting things back seem really difficult when I am in one of my depressive episodes.

I have tried to simplify my lifestyle. I have organized my closet and gotten rid of 10 bags worth of clothes and shoes. Everything has its place in the house. But I can’t seem to shake the feeling of wanting to do van life or tiny home. I think the most simple and happiest times in my life were my college dorm days (I drove there with just two suitcases) and when I’m on vacation and living out of a suitcase. 

My mom has a severe shopping addiction. My family are borderline hoarders. I’m trying to set myself apart from my mom’s bad habits but I can feel myself sometimes buying things to self-soothing when I get really depressed. 

Is it realistic to go from your average house to a tiny home size full of things? I’ve tried quitting things cold turkey before, like coffee…but I want to know am I being too unrealistic?

# Bahrain’s 2025 Business Landscape: Why Start Here?

Feature Image: Business environment in modern Bahrain, showing vibrant financial district *Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain, showing vibrant financial district.* and the [Reuters 2025 Gulf Market Report](https://www.reuters.com/), Bahrain’s GDP is projected to surpass **USD 45 billion** in 2025, with **business formation rates up 13% year-over-year** since the 2024 economic stimulus.

Compared to the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s process is *quicker*, less bureaucratic, and often less expensive. And while Dubai’s DIFC and Riyadh’s new digital licensing are certainly impressive, the Bahraini government (notably the [Economic Development Board (EDB)](https://www.bahrain.com/)) continues to offer the most direct path to **full foreign ownership** for entrepreneurs in tech, finance, and professional services. [Learn more about Bahrain’s most foreigner-friendly sectors here.](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)

However, this streamlined approach doesn’t mean you can just walk into the MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism) and leave with a Sijil (commercial registration) in one afternoon. You’ll need to prepare an airtight set of documents, matched exactly to your chosen business structure.

# Types of Business Entities & Their Documentation Requirements

Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration during Bahrain company formation *Alt text: Business structure and collaboration during Bahrain company formation.*:\*\* The default for SMEs and startups.

* **SPC (Single Person Company):** Solo entrepreneurs or foreign founders.
* **BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company):** For large, shareholder-driven projects.
* **Branch Office:** For multinational expansion, limited to parent activities.
* **Partnerships (General or Limited):** Favored for family businesses.

For an in-depth comparison, check [this breakdown of Bahrain business structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

# Common Documentation Across All Structures

*Company formation in Bahrain* always means collecting these core documents:

* **Passport copies of all shareholders/directors** (must be color, unexpired; Sultanate of Oman and Saudi nationals can provide national IDs)
* **Bahraini National ID (CPR) for local shareholders/directors**
* **Recent passport-sized photographs** (white background, digital & print)
* **Proof of address** (utility bill or bank statement, issued within 3 months)
* **Memorandum & Articles of Association (MOA/AOA)** – template or bespoke
* **Board Resolution (for corporate shareholders)** – properly notarized
* **Parent company documents** (for branches), including:
   * Certificate of Incorporation
   * Trade License/CR
   * Board Resolution authorizing Bahrain branch setup
   * Power of Attorney for authorized signatory
* **Bank reference letters** (sometimes requested by certain sectors)

>*I once arrived at the MOICT in Diplomatic Area just as they closed for Jummah prayers, missing my slot for document validation (rookie mistake). Plan for prayer times and local holidays—timing is everything!*

# Extra Documentation by Business Type

* **Regulated Sectors (finance, healthcare, education):**
   * Approval letters from respective authorities (e.g., CBB, NHRA, Ministry of Education)
   * Professional qualifications or licenses
* **Industrial & Manufacturing:**
   * Environmental clearance (if required)
   * Lease agreement for industrial premises
* **Free Zone Company:**
   * Application to [Bahrain Logistics Zone](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/) or Bahrain International Investment Park

# Bahrain Company Formation Process: Step-by-Step, With Expert Tips

Feature Image: Business process and documentation, showing paperwork and digital preparation *Alt text: Business process and documentation, showing paperwork and digital preparation.*, which consolidates MOICT, LMRA, and EDB data. Accuracy here prevents weeks of delays. (Mis-classifying your commercial activity is a frequent error—always double-check SIC codes).

* Double-verify your activity with Sijilat’s search engine.
* Prepare a draft business plan — short, but specific on operations and revenue.

*Pro Tip:* \**Schedule your visit to the Seef District Sijilat office Tuesday mornings; this avoids the Monday post-weekend rush and the usual Wednesday crowd preparing for early Thursday closures.*

# 2. Name Reservation

* Submit three business name choices.
* Avoid using restricted or sensitive terms (the list is updated quarterly).

# 3. Initial Approval

* Submit scanned copies of all personal and company documents.
* Receive an approval letter within 2-5 working days.

*Insider Shortcut:* **If you know your business structure and have all scanned documents, you can often get pre-approved online—saving a physical trip!**

# 4. Lease/Virtual Office Contract

* Secure a physical address (business center or serviced office is acceptable for many activities).
* Bahrain Bay offices are efficient, but I found the Diplomatic Area landlords to be more flexible with short-term agreements and easier to access during Ramadan hours.
* **Average office rent:** BHD 250–500/month for a virtual office, BHD 600+ for dedicated space.

# 5. Final Document Submission & Commercial Registration (CR)

* Submit hard copies at MOICT or via authorized service agent.
* Receive your Sijil (CR) number—this allows invoice issuance, bank account opening, and hiring.

[For a granular, practical guide to the entire CR process, click here.](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)

# 6. Sectoral Approvals & Labor Market Authority (LMRA) Registration

* Apply for sector permissions if required (finance, health, etc).
* Register with LMRA for labor quotas and visa sponsorship (expat-friendly sectors have special 2025 incentives—see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) for details).

# Document Preparation Shortcuts and Time-Saving Hacks

* **Digital First:** All major authorities in 2025 accept PDF scans. Submit original hard copies only upon final CR issuance or if explicitly requested.
* **Tamkeen E-Sign:** Use Tamkeen digital signature for MOA/AOA to skip manual notary visits.
* **Office Location:** Seef District MOICT is less crowded than Diplomatic Area; Bahrain Bay’s new one-stop business center now issues digital queue numbers (I once saved two hours there on a busy Thursday by using the app).
* **Best Time to Apply:** Avoid Ramadan late afternoons (offices close early, and key staff may be unavailable for document signing).
* **Don’t Forget:** Always carry extra passport photos—smaller branch desks may request physical copies “for the file,” even if your digital upload is perfect.

*Personal aside: The first time I used a business center in Bahrain Bay, the manager offered traditional coffee and dates during our contract signing. This small gesture led to a key networking introduction, ultimately speeding up my municipal approval.*

# Bahrain Company Formation Costs and Fees (2025 Update)

Feature Image: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation *Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.*

* **Municipality Fees:** BHD 80–150 (annual)
* **Office Lease or Virtual Address:** BHD 250–500/month (budget options available)
* **Professional Services (if using agent):** BHD 500–1,500 (WLL/SPC)
* **MOA/AOA Drafting & Notarization (if not e-signed):** BHD 80–200

[For current, itemized cost breakdowns, see this live data hub.](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/)

Surprisingly, the biggest hidden cost is often *time.* Paperwork errors or missing a government notification can delay operations by weeks. Always check for the most *recent* document requirements, as MOICT updates the list after every major regulation change.

# Compliance: Staying Legal After Company Formation

Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain business environment *Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain business environment.*\*\*

[Outsource this hassle to a reputable provider—top pick: KeyLink’s compliance team.](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) They saved my company from a nasty late-filing penalty in 2023!

**2025 Regulatory Change:** As of April 1, 2025, all new entities must e-file annual accounts via the Tamkeen portal within 90 days of fiscal year-end. Delays incur a BHD 250 penalty—don’t get caught out.

# Common Mistake: Underestimating Annual Compliance

Newcomers often assume that after formation, compliance is year-end only. But regular VAT, monthly LMRA payroll reports, and CR renewals are all required. Proactive reminders and a good relationship with your accountant make a world of difference (I use **KeyLink**—their local knowledge is unmatched).

# Foreign Ownership, Sponsorship, and Bahrain’s Unique Advantages

Feature Image: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain business setup *Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain business setup.*

* **No local sponsor required** in most sectors (WLL/SPC/BSC).
* **Special rules for Professional Services**: Some activities may require a qualified Bahraini national as a nominal partner (not always with shareholding interest), but this is clear from the outset and usually procedural.
* **Free Zones:** Full repatriation of profits, zero import/export duties, and fast-tracked regulatory processes. [Explore Bahrain’s free zones.](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/)

>[Learn more about 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain and how it works.](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)

*Unpopular opinion: Bahrain’s less-publicized business-friendly approach, its open banking, and English-language documentation options make it far more navigable than the UAE for first-time founders.*

# Cultural and Local Business Practices You’ll Encounter

Don’t underestimate the role of **majlis meetings**—informal, protocol-rich gatherings where business cards are exchanged with both hands, and deals often start over sweet dates and cardamom coffee. During Ramadan, official business hours shrink, but private networking often intensifies after iftar.

Whenever dealing with government offices—MOICT, LMRA, Sijilat, and Tamkeen—maintain a formal, respectful approach. Dress code is conservative; a blazer or smart abaya is always appropriate.

And: If you’re invited to a business lunch during the approval process, accept! These moments often accelerate approvals, as trust is built face-to-face in Bahrain’s close-knit business circles.

# Tangent: Bahrain’s Start-up Ecosystem and Tamkeen Grants

It might seem off-topic, but the **Tamkeen entrepreneurship grants** of 2025 have changed the funding landscape. Securing a Tamkeen grant *requires* your company’s Sijil and proof of premises—but the deadlines align with company formation, so syncing these processes can speed up your business launch by months. (Synchronizing Tamkeen and MOICT submissions saved my team from losing out on a crucial 2024 grant window.)

# Frequently Asked Questions: Bahrain Company Formation & Documentation

# What are the absolute minimum documents needed for a WLL in Bahrain?

* Valid passport copies (color) and passport photos for all shareholders and directors
* Proof of address for all foreign shareholders
* Draft MOA/AOA
* Lease/virtual office agreement
* Initial business activity approval from Sijilat

[More on step-by-step requirements here.](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/)

# Do I need a local sponsor to start a business in Bahrain?

No, for most activities you do not! [Bahrain allows 99-100% foreign ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/) in a wide range of sectors, far ahead of the UAE or Saudi models.

[Find out where a sponsor may be required.](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)

# How long does company formation usually take if I prepare all documents correctly?

10–14 working days for most structures, provided all documents are complete and correctly formatted. Regulated activities (finance, education, healthcare) can take 2–6 weeks due to sectoral approvals.

# What’s the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make with documentation?

Missing a required notarization, providing outdated address proof, or failing to translate documents into Arabic (if required). Use a professional agent for new ventures—errors delay the Sijil and cost valuable operating time.

# Where can I get help with accounting and post-registration requirements?

Local providers like [KeyLink](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) offer bundled packages for year-round compliance, VAT, and payroll—highly recommended for startups and SMEs.

**Ready to launch your Bahrain business?** Do your homework, prepare your documents with precision, and embrace Bahrain’s unique business culture—you’ll soon be networking over Arabic coffee in the heart of the Gulf’s most dynamic financial haven.

1ltqo2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1ltqo2b/question_regarding_how_video_quality_is_served/,Question regarding how video quality is served,"Hi! I'm new to Immich and I was just wondering if the video quality which is served by default will vary based on my available internet speed.

\--

**Scenario:**   
  
I'm sitting at a coffee shop with a sufficient download speed and I'm requesting a 4K video taken by my phone from my Immich server at home which has a sufficient upload speed to deliver the video in its original quality. None of the default Immich video settings have been altered and the 4K video is in a format which the client supports.

\--

**In this scenario, will I:**

1. Be served the 720p encoded video despite sufficient internet speeds on both ends.
2. Be served the video in its original 4K quality.",7,1751884071.0,immich,0,1.0,False
