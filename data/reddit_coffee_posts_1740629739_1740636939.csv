I don't understand what I'm reacting to, maybe you guys have a sense of whether I've stacked too much? 

Here's my day's journal:
Bkfst 11a: Oatmeal w Pb powder 1/2 tbsp, pepitas, sesame seeds, walnut, maple, cinnamon, almond milk. Coffee almond milk & 2tbsp half & half. 
Lunch 1p: 1 1/2 cup roasted veg (potato turnip parsnip carrot radish, thyme, dill, oregano) w/ Tahini dressing (tahini olive oil lemon juice honey pea protein)
Snak 6p: buckwheat cracker w bellavitano cheese, basil, olive, two cherry tomatoes. 
Dinn 6:45p: roasted veg (same), spinach and radish tops. 2 eggs, 2 small corn tortillas, 6 or so drops fody taco sauce (first time trying)
Pud 8:30p: three dark chocolate covered walnuts, piece of mint dark choc. 

Reaction at 9:30. 

My best guess is the taco sauce???? But it's so soon after having it. Did I somehow stack accidentally? Could it have been the half & half? But 2tb is supposed to be the threshold? I'm so confused and tired of mystery reactions! At this rate I'll never get to do any further actual tests.

They told him that Square was down nationwide, and they don’t accept cash, so they couldn’t directly charge him but they would still make his coffee.

When he told me this, I told him that was crazy they were willing to stay open and operating if they couldn’t charge people and were basically just working for free. That’s when he told me that they said they could accept tips through Venmo, but that he didn’t tip.

I am usually not speechless but this disappointed me so much I just kind of looked at him and he knew I was upset. I told him I couldn’t believe he would just not pay anything- it was out of their control and they were nice enough to make him a free coffee. I insisted he go back tomorrow and tip double to make up for today.

He thinks I’m overreacting since he goes pretty regularly and tips most days, but he didn’t even pay for the value of his coffee so I don’t feel like that makes up for it. 

I guess it’s on the business for taking the risk, but I feel like he should have been more appreciative of their kindness to even offer free coffee since they’re a small business, and we are both really passionate about shopping small/local.

Am I overreacting?? Lmk, I feel kinda crazy

It’s been quite a while (over a year, actually), since my last listing. I had a really turbulent 2024, and it prevented me from being in a place comfortable enough to do proper roleplaying. I had a lot of great partners naturally fade out, and the ones I do still have I very much love, however, have been minimized to a small handful of them, and I’d like to open the door to a few more. 

I’m 26 years old (she/they) from Southern California with a full-time job, so my schedule and posting are varied. I’m huge into doing OOC content like playlist, memes or even reference photos, and I do so even when I’m unable to write replies. I prefer long term stories where we can really work and dissect characters, worlds and more! My terms are still the same; **3rd person over Discord**, I don’t do **OC x Canon or crossover content**, I do offer some original stuff stuff depending, and I ask that you be 18+ when reaching out to me.

Onto the series!

**Yellowjackets** - Lottie, Shauna, Van, Natalie, I would love to take a swing at writing for any of them, and I prefer the pre-rescue versions, or even something prior to the crash if it’s your cup of tea.

**Overwatch** - I can pick up a variety of characters, and I love doing AU’s for this. I’m very drawn to playing Mercy, D.VA, Ana, Lucio, Baptiste, Ashe, Cassidy and potentially Widowmaker, Sombra and Sigma as well. 

**Apex Legends** - I would love to get a chance to write for Horizon, Lifeline or Wraith for this series. I had a Wattson run as well that I would love to return to, if given the chance. 

**Interview With The Vampire** - Binged it, loved it, haven’t had a chance to write for it, but would love to. I think I would be most comfortable writing Louis, Daniel and Claudia, though I could try Lestat and Armand too.

**Cobra Kai** - I JUST finished the finale! Same as above, I haven’t written for anyone yet, but could try doing Miguel, Tori or Johnny to start. Maybe post series?

**Persona 5** - I’ve had great luck finding people to write with, but most are either on hiatus or have quietly stepped away for the time being. I love writing Akira, Ann, Yusuke and recently, I’ve picked up Makoto.

**Invincible** - Currently caught up with the series, have not gotten to the comics just yet. I can try my hand at Mark, Eve, Cecil, Rae and potentially Rex as well. 

**Wrestling/WWE** - This one is a little more complicated, as I would love to do something specially about the characters in kayfabe. Interview stuff is totally fine, but I don’t want to bring up actual names or people. I am most interested in playing Rhea Ripley across from either a Dominick or Liv.

The miscellaneous tracks are: **Monster High**, **Kingdom Hearts**, **Disney/Dreamlight Valley style**, **School Spirits**, **The Last of Us**, **Homestuck**, **Fallout TV show**, **The Bear**, **Fullmetal Alchemist**, **Resident Evil** **DC/Marvel** ( especially animated series like Creature Commandos, Harley Quinn show and the early Titans series, as well as Wandavision, and Agatha All Along) and I would love to try **SpyxFamily**, though I’m very behind on it.

I love doing stories involving **horror** and **romance** especially, however I’m not opposed to **SOL** or **mystery**. I don’t often do stories that align with canon since I heavily prefer AU’s. I have previous ideas from my older post that I would still love to adapt as well.

Specifically, I love things set in **Zombie/Fallout/Apocalypse** style worlds, **Hunger Games/Squid Games/Battle Royales** where we can dive into characters in brutal fights, **spies in a futuristic world or period pieces set in western, 50’s-90’s** and **simple Coffee shop/Bakery/Perfect street** settings where we can let characters have fun and be a little more safe. I also love stuff set in **old school Hollywood and Las Vegas.**

My last request is that you reach out to me with a general idea of what you’d like to do before moving over to Discord. I don’t open nor respond to “hey wanna write” or “let’s RP” messages, as I find them to often lead nowhere. I don’t mind returning partners, however, I don’t like being dropped randomly after a week of planning, OOC chats and excitement. Just let me know you’d like to step out and I’ll be totally content with it.

If you’re at all interested, please feel free to DM me with the word **Psychic** so I know you’ve read through everything seen here. 

Thank you for checking out my post, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!

So this week, for the first time, I approached a girl in the library who I thought is cute, gave her my Instagram, and we have had a few DM exchanges, and possibly will invite her for coffee or drinks soon. Now I want to do a lot more of this!

Here's the thing. With the metoo movement, everywhere you see women complaining about men approaching them, plus accusations of harassment or even worse crimes, even though what happened was respectful and consensual. This is especially true at Universities, although not so much at this school, more out East and in the U.S, I've noticed.

Has anyone here actually had an experience where they had campus security called on them, been publicly identified and slandered on social media, or had scolding emails from Uni Admin, or a Faculty Dean, or had something similar happen, because they decided to respectfully engage in romantic or sexual pursuits?

I really really want to do more of this approaching, but I also want to get a better idea of what the risks are. I know that cold approaching is not the best way to meet people, and Uni clubs and events are much better.

I just want to share a story of me using this product and applying for a return within 24 hours.

# Background

I already use iPhone 15 (non pro) which is very capable for my use case: simple daily first person video. B-roll. Filming at cafes/coffee shops (indoor-outdoor, both day and night, well-lit and badly lit).  
But I need a more simple point and shoot camera AND doesn't look too obvious that I am filming. With iPhone people can see my screen.  
(it's not that I take illegal videos, it's just me being shy)

Also, I have little to zero knowledge about camera specs, and not a person with a lot of budget.

# Why I bought the Ace (non pro)

What I really wanted was a DJI Osmo Pocket.  
The Pocket 3 was out of budget, I cannot justify the purchase.  
Pocket 2, hmmm I was starting to think seriously.  
Pocket 1, I was about to click ""purchase"" on Amazon for the refurbished one.

Then I saw this non pro Ace being sold for around USD 170-ish? after conversion.  
I thought, Pocket 1 was released in 2018 while this Ace in 2023.  
A 5 year difference.  
I didn't think action camera suits my need, but hey it's newer and I can use it for my need as well despite it being an ""action"" camera, right?

# First 24 hours

It was before sunset, somewhat the golden hour, it's just the sunlight didn't really reach my place.  
But it was bright outside.  
I filmed outside situation with both auto (sharpness medium, EV -0.5, 6k 30fps, flat color) and manual, transfer and did a color grading, and it was AWESOME...  
Also the moving screen? It's so great..  
I could already imagine myself attaching a shoulder strap to this camera and bring with me wherever I go to make my B-roll game level up.

Then I tried to film my room. Still around the same hour, not really bright inside.  
It was NOISY (grainy) as hell while my iPhone 15 could film it perfectly.  
Came my first ""oh no.."" moment.  
Switched to manual. Shutter speed two times the FPS or one level below. Turning down the ISO.  
Tweaking it back and forth for the perfect sweet spot.  
Brought it to my computer and edit it, adding color etc. until late at night

Finally somewhat found the final footage that has the aesthetic I wanted.  
The noise the camera has was like a natural grainy effect like a movie, I thought.

I somewhat was relieved.

Then the realization kicked in...  
My feeling of relief was more because I tried really hard to find reasons to justify my purchase and coincidentally found one.  
It was not the ""aha"" moment since the first second. I forced myself to find the aha moment.  
Also I finally got the perfect settings after numerous trials.  
What about the real life situation? I only have 1 or 2 attempts to film in a cafe or coffee shop.  
There is quite a high chance I would be mad because the footage turns out to be noisy/grainy during editing (which is not very visible when seen through the camera screen).

# Ending

I realized that this camera is not for me. Even the Ace Pro, I don't think it's for me due to the low performance indoor and in lower light.  
This camera only excels in the perfect lighting condition. Who knows what happens when it's cloudy.  
I film quite a lot indoors, and the noisy footage just made me sad because I loved how this product looks.

I applied for a return and immediately bought a secondhand DJI Osmo Pocket 1, far cheaper than this camera and should give me great footage for my need.  
I am waiting for my DJI now.

It was a nice 24 hours with this camera. First time experiencing an action camera, and first time experiencing a gadget usage under a day haha.  
I'll probably switch to this kind of action camera if there is one capable of doing what DJI Osmo does.  
But until my hobby switches to outdoor sports, we'll be parting ways for now.",1,1740634070.0,Insta360,0,1.0,False

1iz8gjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1iz8gjb/why_me/,Why me??,"So, the story starts about 3 years ago. Arima, just a normie schoolboy, has been talking to a girl in his class for about 3-4 months, and without realizing it, he has a crush. He likes her a lot, and they've got a lot of common interests and such, but when he went to confess about 2 months later, she told him that she couldn't date him. Heartbroken Arima just went back home and studied as he used to.   
  
Fast forward 7months, Arima has finally gotten over her and now he's got another crush, though this one rejected him at lightning speed without a second thought, Arima also didn't have much of a problem, since it was just a fleeting feeling, and now feels he has dodged a bullet because that same girl was dating his buddy and recently broke up with him after using him for his money.

About about 5 months later, Arima is finally graduating from secondary school to high school. Suddenly, one day, when his first crush and he were talking, and she was ranting about her current boyfriend, she said that she also liked Arima back when he confessed, but couldn't date him because her father and Arima's dad had a lot of stuff going on, so her family wouldn't agree with them dating, poor Arima...

Class 11th, new school, about 4 months in, Arima thinks he has found the one. She's cute and all (Just stuff everyone says when they're obsessed over someone), and she loves reading books and everything. Arima and this girl (Let's say her name's Akane) are doing pretty well. Akane loves books and coffee, just like Arima, and they go on cafe and Book-store visits. About 6 months after they meet, Arima's best friend tells Akane that Arima has a crush on her. Akane confronts him and says she's not interested. Arima has a long mourning after this one. Akane later starts dating one of Arima's buddies. Though they break up after some months, after a huge leak, involving Akane (Yes, another dodged bullet). So, Arima got to know that Akane was kinda (let's just explain the situation). Akane has dated 13 boys in the past 2 years and two-timed most of them including Arima's buddy. So, interpret it yourself.

Class 12th halfway, Arima gets a follow-request on ig. Since he has a private account, he checks out every account that follows him. It's a girl, tom-boyish, cute, beautiful, Arima's type. But he's still not over Akane (The leak is a recent incident). September 2024, he gets a reply to his story about the recent win of the Chess Olympiad, something like ""Yayyy we won"" from this girl (Let's say her name's Hikari). So, he also replied to her, but nothing much happened. In October, he got a text ""hiii"" from Hikari, and he replied, and thus their conversations began. Late night, all day Arima and Hikari texted (sometimes flirted). They had a lot in common, except for some facts, such as, Arima was into Hollywood movies and series, and Hikari loved Old Bollywood movies like YJHD and ZNMD. Arima couldn't stop loving cats, Hikari didn't like cats at all and stuff like that. But they had a lot in common as well. Their talks went on, and without realizing it, Arima had caught feelings. They met up after Arima's exam finished on jan in a cafe for the first time. They went to watch Interstellar in feb. And they're having a pretty good talking stage transition. Now, for the last about 2 weeks, Arima's feeling that Hikari has been avoiding him a lot and isn't interested like she was before. She has stopped texting and seems like she's just not interested in him. Now, what should Arima doooo????????? He's too deeply drowning in his feelings to ignore her, and he can't text her too much, since he'd just seem desperate.....

TL;DR- First crush rejected me, second crush rejected me, First crush says we can't date due to family problems, third crush is kinda a player. Now op likes a girl, jo mujhe bhav nhi de rhi hai, for the last two weeks. What should I do??????",6,1740633761.0,TeenIndia,28,0.88,False

I have been feeling like he doesn’t even like me anymore. I have been feeling this for a while but it’s just getting to a point where I feel like maybe he does love me still but I don’t think he actually likes me anymore. 

I don’t know who he was expecting me to be but I don’t feel like I’ve changed that much or at least any more than someone would over 8 years of dating. I think he wants someone else and I think he’s grasping at things so it seems like my fault when he finally breaks up with me. He’s just so angry all the time. He’s mad that I forgot to turn the toothbrush chargers back on at the wall after wiping them with a damp cloth to get the dust off the plug, mad that I asked if he wanted a coffee some morning because he “always does” so I should just do it without asking, mad that he’s had to change the hand towel in the kitchen cause it was gross so I should’ve changed it already, mad that he has to come to family events because I have “so many”. And I do have a lot because I’m fortunate to have a lot of my older relatives alive and in my life, he doesn’t see one side of his family and they just don’t really have many events. I know an old lady’s 80th isn’t going to be “fun” but it’s something that’s important to me and I can’t understand him not wanting to be part of my family because I love when we go to his family events and love his family. He also seems to be mad at me about how my parents raised me and my siblings. And mad at certain people in my family for not telling the “black sheep” of the family that they’re idiots but mostly seems to be mad at me for not saying anything. When I’m not involved. I’m quite a younger part of my family and this is stuff between my cousins and uncles and grandparents. 

He’s also mad that I haven’t cut my asshole dad off completely when he has. Both of our dads were abusive but one physical and one not but he doesn’t seem to understand that I’m scared to and that it’s harder with my family because his dad doesn’t have much other family where as my dad does. 

He also seems to be mad if I say anything out of the “ordinary”. Like if I phrase something a different way he’ll call me stupid and I must be leaning that from my “other stupid boyfriend”. 

He’s also been calling me lots of names recently like dumb bitch and stuff like that that he’s never called me before. We used to have issues of him calling me stupid a lot but I thought we’d worked through that. 

He’s also been drinking a lot more and a few months ago got all in my face because I couldn’t find one of his headphones that he dropped. He grabbed me by the back of my neck and showed me the other one really close to me saying “this is what it looks like” and stuff like that. He’s stopped drinking the alcohol he was drinking that night and hasn’t done anything since but I just feel really off about that. 

The other day I also took my car that he usually drives to work instead of the car my grandparents gave us (it’s a shit car and the aircon doesn’t always work so I get it) a town over to help my younger brother with some issues with  his uni enrolment and then had to pick up and choose the present for my grandmas 80th (I’ve been given the money and the vibes but had to pick cause I live in a bigger town than what we’re from originally and there’s better jewellery stores there). I did all of that and left 1h 20 mins before I had to be home (which was later than I meant to but everything seemed to just take so much time, places didn’t have stock etc.) and the drive should’ve taken about 35 mins but have myself like double incase of traffic thinking I’d be early. Well the drive was awful, I was behind accidents and there was lane closures cause of lorries breaking down, all of that stuff. I finally made it 20 mins before he had to go to work when he usually leaves 15 minutes before- but, of course, that was wrong too because he wanted to leave early to get another case of water on the way cause his work was out. But I didn’t know that so I’m not sure why he was so mad. And when I said he could’ve taken the shit car to work and got the water and I could’ve just come and swapped the cars so he could at least drive home because I would much prefer to take my car which is newer and more reliable on the highway but he said I should’ve just taken the shit car. 

I really just don’t get why he’s still here if I’m so awful. I’m trying my best to look after him and the house and help out my family and work full time and study and it’s just never enough. 

I really feel like I should break up with him but honestly I think I’m scared to break up with him. I’m also scared he’ll take our dog when he goes and I don’t think I could deal without her. 

This is such a mess of thoughts if anyone reads this far so I apologise and this turned into something more than I meant it to be and there’s obviously more to the story like the extra stress he’s been under with work and some health things I’m dealing with, both of our shitty dads and how that trauma affects us etc. but yeah… I just really don’t know what to do.

\---

For over 10 years now I have been suffering from tinnitus but lately it has become even more overwhelming. It is difficult to describe but I have noticed multiple tones and frequencies. Constant and pulsing.

Constant:

* Loud low-frequency whistle/peep in my left
* Softer and quieter in the right
* Static, electric hum/hiss (in both... or inside my head.)

Pulsing:

* Another static, electric hum/hiss that seems to pulse in the rhythm of my heartbeat. Both sides again.

These hisses are strange. I can only describe them like an old CRT TV inside my head that is turned on. You can hear the TV is on, as it hisses but there is no picture, not even the ""static screen of snowstorm"". It's pretty low and feels like it is not in my ears but rather around me. Another is the TV with static snowstorm that pulses to my heartbeat.

How do I differentiate?:

I've noticed I can manipulate the loudness in several ways. I can even produce extra sounds.

* Biting down hard creates another tone in my left ear that temporarily drowns the constant tinnitus, but it also makes it louder after.
* By pressing a spot at the base of my skull, just under my earlobe on the left, I can make the constant static tinnitus really louder. Harder I press, the louder it gets
   * On the right, at the same spot the effect isn't as notable
      * on the right, pressing my skull ABOVE my ear makes the noise louder in my right ear.
* Pressing my jaw back by the chin can silence the most noises.
   * press too hard an it creates an extra tone

Lately the noises have been getting louder. It's beginning to make bedtime difficult and its starting to ***drive me nuts.*** Normally the tinnitus got more noticeable when I'm stressed but this time it's even more extreme.

I’m feeling pretty introspective today and wanted to dive into a thought-provoking topic with all of you. Let's talk about the power of silence. 🤫

• Have you ever noticed how uncomfortable silence can be in our society? It seems like we are constantly bombarded with noise - from endless notifications on our phones to the constant chatter in our workplaces and social circles.

• But what if I told you that embracing silence can be incredibly transformative? Not only does it provide us with an opportunity for deep inner reflection, but it also allows us to truly listen and understand others.

• In a world where everyone seems to be in a rush to speak and be heard, silence can be a revolutionary act. It forces us to slow down, be present, and truly engage with the world around us.

• Silence also allows for communication on a deeper level. When we give ourselves the permission to stay silent, we create space for others to express themselves without fear of interruption or judgment. This kind of listening fosters empathy and strengthens our connections with others.

• Furthermore, silence can be a powerful tool for self-discovery. It is in the quiet moments of solitude that we can truly connect with our inner selves, cultivate self-awareness, and gain insights into our own thoughts and emotions.

So, how can we incorporate more silence into our noisy lives?

1. Practice mindful moments of silence throughout your day. Whether it's during your morning coffee, a walk in nature, or before bed, make a conscious effort to pause and embrace the tranquility of the present moment.

2. Become a better listener. When engaging in conversations, resist the urge to interject or respond immediately. Instead, give the speaker your full attention and allow for moments of silence before formulating your thoughts. You'll be amazed at how much you can learn by truly listening.

3. Disconnect from technology. Put away your phone, turn off notifications, and give yourself designated periods of",1,1740632580.0,magicalignment,0,1.0,False

He is in Med School and I am finishing my undergrad right now. We made a plan to go on a date at a coffee shop and exchanged instagrams.

A few hours before the date, he texted me saying he forgot he had to tutor some first years and wanted to reschedule. He was super apologetic, and was saying “you’re free on these days right?” Where I said yes. I have never heard back from him. 

It has now been a few days I am an extremely stubborn person and I don’t want to text him since the ball is in his court. All my friends I’ve told this think I should text him and at the very least be like “hey did you not want to go on a date?” But again I’m stubborn and have a little too much self-respect for that. Should I be the bigger person and message him? What would I say? Should I just ignore it? I just felt like we had gotten along so well and he seemed like he genuinely wanted to meet.

I cut a lemon in half and put slits into both halves. On a small piece of paper, I wrote the names of the parties on either piece and my intentions. I folded each piece and put it into each side of the lemon. From here, I added chili power, cumin, pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and coffee grounds on each side. I sealed the two sides of the lemon together with black wax. Finished it off with 3 push pins on each side!

I fully went into the situation with him thinking of it as fwb which I have a history of having long term..current one is going on 5 years. Anyway we got emotionally attached and I had been very guarded about it due to my current martial situation and then I kind of just emotionally attached with the knowledge this will end soon and trying to focus on the now. We both have very demanding jobs and despite that and his obligations and focus on his wife, who I adore platonically, we have been able to set a standard of seeing each other 2-3 times a week for about 6 months now. This last week he brought up wanting to see other people, which l expressed I was ok with as long as it didn't take time away from me. We are currently down to seeing each other once a week because of his schedule and havent been physically intimate for about 10 days. Despite this and his work schedule and personal schedule of me not being able to see him this week, he decided he was going to try to see someone new this week on the one night he may have free. I am ok with this in principle but it really irked me ...like I won't see him this week because of his other obligations and he wants to take the one free time he has to see someone new. When I mentioned I didn't appreciate the lack of time management, he expressed he didn't see it that way, thought our 30 minute public coffee date (where we couldn't even touch besides a good bye hug due to our respective careers) was sufficient and didn't feel like he was being unreasonable that he just wanted to try different energy to help his mood because me and his work were a bit heavy this week. I am absolutely a bit heavy emotionally (started my own business, financially struggling and marriage falling apart) but I've tried my best to isolate him from this.  Am I being unreasonable in this irking me? We chatted it out but I worry I may have pushed it into his head that I have an issue with him seeing other people which is not the issue.

I made a mistake that led to a massive argument with my mom. There was a cup I used to drink coffee from, and at some point, I accidentally left it in the laundry along with my used pads and underwear. Why does my laundry have used pads and underwear?



**Additional information:** Because we live in an apartment, there are two bathrooms, one in my mom's room and another near my brother's and dad's room, and the bathroom that I'm supposed to throw them in is my mom's because she doesn't want my other brothers seeing my pads and stuff. And there isn't even a trashcan in my brother and dad's bathroom.



Back to the question: The reason it was in my laundry is that there were numerous times when I had to change my pad in the middle of the night because of my period. I couldn't change it in that bathroom because my mom would lock the door when she slept, so I had to r, move them and put them in my laundry to wear a fresh one. So yeah, I put a cup in that same old laundry because I didn't want my mom to see that I didn't want to see it. Back in my room, my brain thought that was the best choice. I didn't think much of it, and I didn't even know the cup existed in the laundry; I completely forgot as it's been some months, and an old bedsheet covers it I don't use, and I use a new laundry basket) until my mom found it. She has now generalized the situation, assuming that I've been hiding utensils and cups in my pad laundry and throwing them in the sink, which isn't the case. I repeatedly tried explaining that I didn't know that particular cup was in the laundry and that I only bring the cups I drink coffee from, which sit on my desk. I feel like shit. I feel so embarrassed.

My mom got incredibly upset and started yelling at me. She even got physical, pulling my hair harshly and digging her nails into my arms. She threw the cup at me and tried to beat me with it, but I just blocked desperately. She said that my actions were disgusting and that she could never look at me the same way again. She told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed about everything, and like I've completely ruined my relationship with her. I could die. I'd rather die.

She also repeatedly told me to leave for the night and stay outside in the cold, threatening me she was going to either expel me from school or get out of her house, but I stayed put because I was frozen with my head pounding. My dad knows what happened, and I can't face him. My dad is everything to me. I can't face anyone. I'm seriously debating starving in my room, and I don't know what will happen anymore.

I know what I did was careless, and I feel terrible about it. I wasn't trying to disrespect anyone, but this mistake has turned everything upside down. I don't know how to fix this. I've apologized and tried to explain myself, but she doesn't want me to talk to her or look at me. Nothing is getting through. It's all my fault. I don't know how to do anything at this point.",2,1740631462.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Is there any way I could get a 2nd chance?,"I’ll try to make this super quick and short, around the end of January, a long time mutual refollowed me on instagram and following and unfollowing a couple times within the last 2 years or so. Keep in mind, I’ve had a really good relationship with her parents outside of her and they really wanted me to date her for the longest time.

Her best friend pretty much told me the she was interested in me which caught me off guard since I was pretty much in my own lane and wasn’t really looking around, but I figured I’d give it a try.

After talking to her for two weeks, I had taken her out to a vinyl store/coffee date and on valentine’s day I gave her flowers and chocolate and went to the movies, which we cuddled for a bit nearing the end. Her best friend event went to saw she got emotional after our 2nd date. Not even 3-4 days after that I started sensing that the connection was not there like it was before. I’ve been enjoying getting to know her and talking to her, so when the connection slowly started fading away it kinda hurt me. Now she’s blown me off and I have a specific record she wanted in my house that I kinda don’t want to have it with me :(

Here’s where I went wrong:
My parents have been going through a divorce and it affected me pretty badly. As an overthinker I was worried about the possibility of the future where if I commit to this relationship she could one day and tell me she doesn’t love my anymore (which I learned ISTJ are pretty loyal thankfully that would never be the case) That being said, I wasn’t clear about my intentions and I wanted to simply get to know her a bit more before moving to the next stage. Her on the other hand, it seemed like we was ready to get it rolling, so super different pacing here from my understanding.

Correct me if I’m wrong on this, but I’m a very busy guy, so I wasn’t able to text her all the time like I wanted to, but also I would run out of things to say so I would check up on her and share what was going on at work. I may have talked too much about me and my work.

Where do things stand as of now:
I still want to give her the vinyl, but through her best friend. I was thinking of leaving a note as well (not too sure what to write on it)

Please tell me what I did wrong and if there’s any slight possible chance I can get a second chance. I’m open to answering any questions you guys may have. I genuinely like this girl and her family. Feel free to call me a piece of shit if I did anything wrong

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\

  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iz7ja9,https://i.redd.it/ky34cd4a0mle1.jpeg,Celebrate my one year free after 40 years smoking! My story..,"
It's hard to believe, but here I am celebrating one year smoke/nicotine free!
When I first quit I hung out in this sub all day for days looking for inspiration, and hope that I can join the ranks of those that had quit.

So I hope my story will help and inspire you.

I started smoking at 12 and after 40 years it was time, so at 52 I gave it up. I have thought about quitting and was anxious for years that I was still smoking, but I just couldn't let go.

 I ended up with a TIA (mini stroke, I am fine no permanent damage)) this scared the crap out of me and I made the decision in the hospital it was time to quit.

I spent the next 30 days trying hard.
 I cut down to 5 smokes a day then like 3 a day. I was chewing nicotine gum in between smokes. 

I was driving myself crazy! I paid attention to every cigarette I smoked. I was not talking, or scrolling the phone I was in the smoking moment, analyzing. Why was I doing this, why did I need to smoke. 

After reading Allen Carr, Easy way to quit smoking..I realized smoking is an addiction and not a habit. This turned on all the light bulbs. I leaned into the cravings and saw them for what they were. Just an addiction. 

If I could get thru 3 days without feeding the addiction..it will go away! So chewing gum and the few smokes a day was just prolonging the pain.

 So at 9 am a year ago, I smoked my last smoke. I huffed and puffed hard and fast so I tasted every nasty chemical and put it out.

For 3 days the minutes felt like hours. But I stayed strong. I wanted the craving to go away. I knew if I can get thru the next few days, i could do it! I did everything to keep busy and change my routine. Getting up I had to remind myself we don't smoke so I don't automatically go get coffee and head outside! I got coffee and sat at the kitchen table. I cleaned, I slept, I walked, I took deep breaths, I got angry, I cried, but I got thru!! Sugar free Gum and mints have been my survival kit.

I felt tired and unmotivated for a few months. I know I was fighting depression. This is normal. It was my brain rewiring itself and my body was tired from fighting addiction.

I think at 3 to 4 months I felt good and about 6 months I felt great and energy levels came back. 

At one year I do still think about smoking.
I think I will always have the urge. It's not a big deal anymore tho. I don't think about it first thing in the morning while drinking coffee or driving or even after meals.
It's a different thought.
Like I miss an old friend but only every now and then.
I find myself going days without thinking about smokes. It's pretty cool to be in control now!

 I really notice how less anxious and stressed I am. It's a good feeling. I notice more money in my wallet. I notice I smell good and I enjoy my perfumes!
Things that I tell myself

1. Having a smoke now will do nothing like you remember. It will taste like crap and not satisfy like you think. It's not worth it.
2. No matter what is going on, smoking will not solve, cure or relieve yourself from the situation..it's just smoking. 
3. Smoking is just calming the addiction and the anxiety that the addiction causes it does nothing more
4. Wait. Just do something else think about something else and the craving passes.

This was long, sorry..Im a talker! If.you have questions I will answer.
I do hope my story and advice helps! 
You can do it! You got this!!!

The relationship ended due to financial irresponsibility and some concerning behavior.

Financial Issues:
	•	She had $35K in credit card debt and bought a $55K car just because she liked the color, bringing her total debt to $90K (by the time she’s done paying interest). She is also 30 and lives at home with no real expenses or rent. 

	•	She was earning around $21K/year as a realtor and hadn’t sold a house in 4 months.

	•	She didn’t know how to pay off her credit card and couldn’t clearly explain how she accumulated so much debt when I asked her

	•	She spent on unnecessary luxuries like $60/month culligen water delivery and two gym memberships while drowning in debt. I also tried to help set up a monthly budget and she refused 3 times as she didn’t want to show me her banking which makes me think there was more debt she was hiding. I only knew of the 35k and car because she told me. She would also say that she didn’t have bad spending habits despite the debt. And she would always say she is a self made woman while she lives at home and is actively losing money everyday. 

	•	I helped her get a debt consolidation loan and set up a meeting for her to see a financial planner, but she was defensive and emotional about it and came home crying as he told her she needed to double the amount of houses she sold 

	•	She has a pattern of instability — failed her real estate exam 8 times, has 6 speeding tickets, and has been fired from 3 jobs.

Reckless Behavior:

She ran a red light last week to get to me faster.
Once flipped off a cop while we were driving. And she constantly blurs boundaries with other men and engages and seeks out conversations with them and says she is networking for clients. 

She also went out for coffee with an old tinder flame and said they were friends. She didn’t tell me until a month later. And I voiced this saying I felt uncomfortable about it. And then she asked if she could call him on the phone a few weeks later. 

Despite all this, I cared deeply about her. She started making some changes, but only after a lot of pressure from me. I felt like I was becoming her financial coach instead of her partner.

Did I give up too soon, or was this breakup the right decision? 

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months due to financial irresponsibility ($90K in debt, impulsive spending, no stable income) and lack of emotional boundaries with men. She failed her real estate exam 8 times, had 6 speeding tickets, got fired from 3 jobs, and didn’t know how to pay off her credit card at 30. She also engaged in conversations with other men that blurred boundaries (e.g., went for coffee with an old Tinder match, responded to flirty messages from coworkers/clients). She was sweet, family-oriented, and we had a strong emotional/physical connection, but the long-term concerns felt too big to ignore.

I got two questions regarding dialing in and milk steaming on my bambino plus, I have been using the machine for a year and it has all been good so far.  However, recently I bought a specific single origin bean which I figured requires me grind a lot coarser than I normally need to (My Varia v3 pro grinder setting is normally between 3.5-3 on most of my beans).  My grinder is currently set to 4 now which is slightly coarser but the extraction is still very minimal, only 10g (18g beans) out in 40 seconds.  The struggle is, the shot is starting to taste sour but the coffee still seem to be too fine to extract properly, what should I do?



Second question is regarding my bambino plus, I have always enjoyed using the auto milk-steaming function for a quick drink, recently I have bought a new WPM milk jug and I realized, even with the same milk temperature (medium) and froth level (medium), the WPM milk jug is a lot hotter than my old one while steaming, which I believe is because the milk is taking longer to froth? My milk also seemed thicker when it used to be thinner and very suitable for latte art on my old milk jug.

Have you ever imagined what life with me would be like the way I have with you? Have you ever let your mind wander into the quiet, unspoken moments—the ones that aren’t grand or extraordinary, but simply us? Have you ever daydreamed about waking up beside me, about the rhythm of our mornings, the way we’d fall into easy conversation over coffee or sit in comfortable silence, understanding each other without a word?

Do you ever picture the way my hand would naturally find yours in a crowded room, how we’d move through the world together, side by side? Have you thought about the little details—how I’d look at you when I think you’re not paying attention, the way my voice would soften when I say your name, the way we’d share inside jokes that only make sense to us?

Because I have. I’ve imagined the late-night talks, the spontaneous adventures, the quiet reassurances in the middle of a storm. I’ve let my mind paint a picture of a life where you and I aren’t just passing thoughts, but a constant, an unshaken presence in each other’s days.

And do you still, despite everything—despite time, despite distance, despite the choices we’ve made—continue to have these daydreams? Do they still slip into your thoughts unexpectedly, catching you off guard in quiet moments?

Because sometimes, I find myself doing just that. I’ll be in the middle of my day, and suddenly, there you are. In a memory that never happened, in a future that never will. I see us in places we’ve never been, having conversations we never had, living a life that only exists in the corners of my mind. And for a fleeting moment, it feels real—like if I just reached out far enough, I could touch it.

X (née Twitter) has a beta going right now for their Grok AI tool, so I asked it for help. Below are my three queries and what Grok came back with. Even I can see where it got a couple of things wrong, and it couldn't completely overcome a bit of my own garbage-in-garbage-out in the second query (the part where I told it to increase my maximum pot size but didn't tell it to disqualify dishes that wouldn't fit into that pot). On the other hand it ""verified"" my hunch that Ninja Salad is my best salad so I'll overlook that. :)

Anyway, I'm sure that this is well within the capabilities of other LLMs out there. I just think it's interesting, so I thought that I'd share. Do you think that its analysis is correct, and did I even ask it the right questions?

  
\-- Antoyal



\--------------------

**My first query**:  In Pokémon Sleep, what are the strongest dishes of each type (Curries, Salads, and Desserts) when measured in average strength per ingredient?

>In Pokémon Sleep, determining the ""strongest"" dishes by average strength per ingredient requires looking at each dish's base strength and dividing it by the number of ingredients needed to make it. This metric highlights efficiency—how much strength you get per ingredient invested. Since recipe levels and extra ingredients can increase a dish's total strength over time, we'll focus on base strength (the starting strength at level 1) as the most consistent measure for this comparison. The data comes from the latest available recipe lists as of February 26, 2025. Here are the strongest dishes for each type—Curries, Salads, and Desserts—calculated by average base strength per ingredient:  
  
**Curries**

>**Strongest Dish**: ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew

>Base Strength: 7,447

>Ingredients Required: 50 (20 Bean Sausage, 15 Soft Potato, 15 Rousing Coffee)

>Average Strength per Ingredient: 7,447 ÷ 50 = \~148.94

>**Why It Wins**: Introduced with the Old Gold Power Plant area, this stew edges out other high-strength curries like ""Inferno"" Corn Keema (base strength 5,985 with 41 ingredients, \~146.0 per ingredient) due to its slightly higher efficiency. The inclusion of Rousing Coffee, a potent new ingredient, boosts its base power significantly.

>  
**Salads**

>**Strongest Dish**: ""Ninja Salad""

>Base Strength: 8,137

>Ingredients Required: 53 (15 Large Leek, 19 Greengrass Soybeans, 12 Tasty Mushroom, 11 Warming Ginger)

>Average Strength per Ingredient: 8,137 ÷ 53 = \~153.53

>**Why It Wins**: Despite competition from ""Defiant"" Coffee-Dressed Salad (base strength 10,094 with 68 ingredients, \~148.4 per ingredient), ""Ninja Salad"" offers better efficiency with its high base strength spread across fewer ingredients. It’s a late-game powerhouse that rewards careful ingredient gathering.

>  
**Desserts**

>**Strongest Dish**: ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola

>Base Strength: 9,985

>Ingredients Required: 67 (20 Large Leek, 35 Fancy Apple, 20 Warming Ginger, 12 Rousing Coffee)

>Average Strength per Ingredient: 9,985 ÷ 67 = \~149.03

>**Why It Wins**: This dessert, also tied to the Old Gold Power Plant update, narrowly beats out ""Jigglypuff's Fruity Flan"" (base strength 8,223 with 55 ingredients, \~149.5 per ingredient) due to its higher raw base strength, though the efficiency is very close. The large ingredient count reflects its late-game focus, but it delivers exceptional power.

>  
**Notes and Caveats**

>**Base Strength Focus**: These calculations use base strength at level 1, as recipe levels (which increase strength over time) vary by player progress. Extra ingredients beyond the recipe can also boost strength, but that’s situational and not reflected here.

>**Ingredient Accessibility**: Dishes like ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew and ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola"" rely on Rousing Coffee, which is only available from specific Pokémon in the Old Gold Power Plant area, making them harder to cook early on. ""Ninja Salad"" uses more common ingredients but still requires significant farming.

>**Practicality**: High-ingredient dishes (50+) often need an expanded cooking pot (beyond the default 15) or Sunday’s bonus pot size, so they’re less practical for beginners compared to simpler recipes like ""Bulk Up"" Bean Curry (1,973 base strength with 18 ingredients, \~109.6 per ingredient).

>  
**Summary**

>**Curry**: ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew (\~148.94 strength/ingredient)

>**Salad**: ""Ninja Salad"" (\~153.53 strength/ingredient)

>**Dessert**: ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola (\~149.03 strength/ingredient)

>Among these, ""Ninja Salad"" stands out as the most efficient overall, squeezing the highest average strength per ingredient. However, all three are top-tier options for maximizing Snorlax’s strength once you can gather the ingredients and expand your pot!



\--------------------

**My second query**:  Using the above information, assume that I have a maximum cooking pot size of 51 and that I always fill the pot. The extra ingredients used to fill the pot to 51 will average to 125 strength each.

>Given your maximum cooking pot size of 51 and the condition that you always fill the pot, we'll adjust the ""strongest"" dish calculations for Curries, Salads, and Desserts from Pokémon Sleep. The dishes analyzed previously—""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew (Curry), ""Ninja Salad"" (Salad), and ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola (Dessert)—require 50, 53, and 67 ingredients respectively at their base recipes. Since your pot caps at 51, we’ll assume you use the base recipe ingredients up to the required amount (or as close as possible within 51) and fill any remaining slots with extra ingredients averaging 125 strength each. This reflects a practical scenario where you top off the pot without exceeding it. Let’s recalculate the total strength for each dish under these constraints and determine the strongest by average strength per ingredient.  
  
**Curries: ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew**

>**Base Recipe**: 50 ingredients (20 Bean Sausage, 15 Soft Potato, 15 Rousing Coffee)

>**Base Strength**: 7,447

>**Pot Adjustment**:

>Use all 50 base ingredients (fits within 51).

>Add 1 extra ingredient to reach 51.

>**Extra Strength**: 1 × 125 = 125

>**Total Strength**: 7,447 + 125 = 7,572

>**Average Strength per Ingredient**: 7,572 ÷ 51 = \~148.47

>  
**Salads: ""Ninja Salad""**

>**Base Recipe**: 53 ingredients (15 Large Leek, 19 Greengrass Soybeans, 12 Tasty Mushroom, 11 Warming Ginger)

>**Base Strength**: 8,137

>**Pot Adjustment**:

>Can’t fit all 53; use 51 ingredients instead.

>Proportionally scale: 51/53 ≈ 96.23% of the recipe.

>Adjusted Base Strength: 8,137 × (51/53) ≈ 7,828 (rounded).

>No extra ingredients needed since the pot is full at 51.

>**Total Strength**: \~7,828

>**Average Strength per Ingredient**: 7,828 ÷ 51 = \~153.49

>  
**Desserts: ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola**

>**Base Recipe**: 67 ingredients (20 Large Leek, 35 Fancy Apple, 20 Warming Ginger, 12 Rousing Coffee)

>Base Strength: 9,985

>**Pot Adjustment**:

>Can’t fit all 67; use 51 ingredients instead.

>Proportionally scale: 51/67 ≈ 76.12% of the recipe.

>Adjusted Base Strength: 9,985 × (51/67) ≈ 7,598 (rounded).

>No extra ingredients needed since the pot is full at 51.

>**Total Strength**: \~7,598

>**Average Strength per Ingredient**: 7,598 ÷ 51 = \~148.98

>  
**Comparison and Winner**

>**Curry**: ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew: \~148.47 strength/ingredient

>**Salad**: ""Ninja Salad"": \~153.49 strength/ingredient

>**Dessert**: ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola"": \~148.98 strength/ingredient

>  
**Analysis**

>**""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew""**: With a base requirement of 50, it fits almost perfectly into your 51-slot pot, leaving just 1 slot for an extra ingredient (125 strength). This keeps its efficiency high and close to its original value (\~148.94 → \~148.47).

>**""Ninja Salad""**: Originally requiring 53 ingredients, it’s slightly nerfed by the 51-slot cap (losing \~2/53 of its strength), but its high base efficiency still shines through, maintaining the highest average strength per ingredient.

>**""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola""**: Requiring 67 ingredients, it takes a bigger hit when scaled down to 51 (\~76% of its base strength), but its massive starting strength keeps it competitive.

>  
**Conclusion**  
With a pot size of 51 and extra ingredients averaging 125 strength each, ""Ninja Salad"" remains the strongest dish across all types at \~153.49 average strength per ingredient. Its efficiency holds up even when slightly underfilled, making it the best choice for maximizing Snorlax’s strength under your constraints. If you’re prioritizing raw total strength, ""Ninja Salad"" (7,828) still edges out ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew (7,572) and ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola (7,598), though the margins are slim. Go with the salad for peak performance!



\--------------------

**My third query**: Now assume that I have a Good Camp Ticket active, so my maximum cooking pot size is actually 77.

>With a Good Camp Ticket active in Pokémon Sleep, your maximum cooking pot size increases to 77, and you always fill the pot to capacity. Using the same dishes—""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew"" (Curry), ""Ninja Salad"" (Salad), and ""Zing Zap"" Spiced Cola"" (Dessert)—we’ll adjust the calculations based on their base recipes and fill any remaining slots with extra ingredients averaging 125 strength each. This setup reflects the boosted pot size from the Good Camp Ticket, which lasts for 72 hours and enhances your cooking capacity significantly. Let’s compute the total strength and average strength per ingredient for each dish with a pot of 77.  
  
**Curries: ""Hidden Power"" Perk-Up Stew""**

>**Base Recipe**: 50 ingredients (20 Bean Sausage, 15 Soft Potato, 15 Rousing Coffee)

>**Base Strength**: 7,447

>**Pot Adjustment**:

>Use all 50 base ingredients.

>Add 77 - 50 = 27 extra ingredients.

>**Extra Strength**: 27 × 125 = 3,375

>**Total Strength**: 7,447 + 3,375 = 10,822

>**Average Strength per Ingredient**: 10,822 ÷ 77 = \~140.55

>  
**Salads: ""Ninja Salad""**

>**Base Recipe**: 53 ingredients (15 Large Leek, 19 Greengrass Soybeans, 12 Tasty Mushroom, 11 Warming Ginger)

>**Base Strength**: 8,137

>**Pot Adjustment**:
