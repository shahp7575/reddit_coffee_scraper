1qrdllu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qrdllu/what_should_i_say_to_him/,What should I say to him?,"For Christmas, my boyfriend (30M) and I (29F) exchanged gifts. We agreed on a budget of 20 € to save some money, and I agreed to stick to it. I went a little over and spent around 25 €. I bought him gloves with a flashlight because he's always fixing things, and I thought it would be useful for him. They cost around 3 € on Shein. The second gift was a massage gun because he talked about it a lot and loves massages. I initially wanted to order it from Amazon, but it would have arrived in January since I was waiting to get paid on December 10th. I found another one on Temu for 22 €, a Lenovo brand, and bought it.

He bought me an electric cup that mixes itself because I had mentioned wanting a bottle/cup for my morning coffee on the go. I was happy with the gift because it's something I actually wanted.

Later, while ordering more from Temu, I saw the cup was only around 7-8 €. I felt a little bad, not because he should have spent more, but because we had a budget and he still went under. I'm happy with the gift, but I feel like I need to say something.

My birthday is coming in February (turning 30), and since we've known each other for six years, I'd like him to choose something meaningful, not a cheap item that might break after a few weeks. I'm not asking him to spend a lot, since we still try to save, but I want it to feel special. I'd like advice on how to tell him this clearly, or if anyone has examples of gifts they really liked or wished they had received, I could use that to guide him.

TL;DR: I want to talk to my boyfriend about following a spending limit for gifts, without sounding lika a b****.",1,1769797581.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

im at the grocery store right, just getting like bread and coffee the usual. and i walking down the aisle and i hear this kid, maybe 4, just start wailing. like full on meltdown. the mom is trying to calm him down but you can tell she's just DONE. she's got that hollow look in her eyes, you know the one.

and i'm just trying to get past them to get to the cereal, kinda awkward. as i pass, the kid screams, ""I WANT GRANDMA!"" and the mom just says, so quiet but i heard it, ""Grandma's gone, baby. remember?""

and the kid just...stops. he looks at her and says, ""But she said she was tired. Is she still sleeping?""

i swear my heart just crumpled up like a piece of paper. i didnt even think, i just blurted out ""my nana took a long nap once too."" the mom looks at me and for a second we just looked at each other. i've never seen so much exhaustion and grief and 'thank you for not judging me' in one face.

she just nodded at me, a real nod, and managed to get the kid calmed down enough to put in the cart.

i just paid for my stuff and left. i'm sitting in my car crying and i don't even know why. for that mom, for that kid, for my nana who died when i was eight. it's just so freaking sad and beautiful and heavy all at once. how do people carry this weight all the time? like we're all just walking around with these invisible bruises.

1qrdhwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupplementShop/comments/1qrdhwu/dark_labs_maniaco_highstim_preworkout_full_label/,Dark Labs Maniaco (High‑Stim Pre‑Workout) — Full label breakdown + responsible-use notes,"**Disclosure:** I carry/sell [Maniaco in our shop.](https://nutritionalsupplementshop.com/products/dark-labs-maniaco) This post is intentionally **informational (not hype)** so you can understand the label, decide if it fits your tolerance, and use it responsibly.



# Quick snapshot

* **Category:** High‑stimulant pre‑workout
* **Servings:** 20
* **Serving size:** **1 scoop (22.1 g)**
* **Stimulant level:** **Very high** (400 mg caffeine + additional stimulants)
* **Flavors (varies by availability):** Pina Colada, Cherry Mango, Green Apple, Sour Blueberry, Tropical Mango

If you’re new to “hardcore” formulas or you’re stimulant‑sensitive, this is **not** a casual daily driver.



# Supplement Facts (per 1 scoop / 22.1 g)

* **L‑Citrulline — 10,000 mg**
* **L‑Tyrosine — 4,000 mg**
* **Beta‑Alanine — 3,200 mg**
* **Caffeine Anhydrous — 400 mg**
* **2‑Aminoisoheptane (DMHA) — 300 mg**
* **N‑Phenethyldimethylamine Citrate — 300 mg**
* **Alpha Yohimbine (90% Rauwolscine) — 2 mg** 



# What each ingredient is doing (plain-English)

# L‑Citrulline (10 g)

Commonly used to support **blood flow/pumps** by increasing nitric oxide availability (indirectly via arginine). **10 g is a large dose** relative to many mainstream pre‑workouts.

# L‑Tyrosine (4 g)

An amino acid involved in catecholamine production (dopamine/norepinephrine). Often included for **focus and “stress-resilience”** during hard training.

# Beta‑Alanine (3.2 g)

The classic **“tingles”** ingredient. It supports muscle carnosine over time (typically requires consistent intake), but acutely it’s mostly the noticeable paresthesia for many users.

# Caffeine Anhydrous (400 mg)

This is a **high** caffeine dose by itself. If you take a full scoop, treat it like your main caffeine source for the day.

# 2‑Aminoisoheptane (DMHA) (300 mg)

A strong stimulant often described as adding **drive/urgency** beyond caffeine. Effects and tolerance are highly individual.

# N‑Phenethyldimethylamine Citrate (300 mg)

A phenethylamine‑type stimulant used for **mood/drive** in some formulas. Human data is limited compared with staples like caffeine.

# Alpha Yohimbine / Rauwolscine (2 mg, 90%)

Potent stimulant/adrenergic ingredient that can feel “sharp” and can be **jittery** for some users (especially stacked with caffeine). This is one of the ingredients most likely to separate “advanced stim users” from everyone else.



# Who this is (and isn’t) for

**More likely to be a fit if you:**

* Have experience with higher‑stim pre‑workouts
* Want a **fully disclosed** label with aggressive stimulant support
* Train earlier in the day and can tolerate long-lasting stimulation

**Probably NOT a fit if you:**

* Are new to pre‑workouts, or you’re caffeine‑sensitive
* Train late afternoon/evening (sleep disruption risk is real)
* Have blood pressure/heart rhythm concerns, panic/anxiety issues, or you’re on stimulant/adrenergic meds (talk to a clinician first)
* Are **drug-tested** (see notes below)



# How to use it responsibly (harm-reduction > bravado)

* **Start with ½ scoop** for your first use.
* Take **20–30 minutes pre‑training**.
* **Do not exceed 1 scoop in 24 hours.**
* **Do not stack** with other stimulant products (fat burners, extra yohimbine/rauwolscine, high-caffeine energy drinks, etc.).
* Track your **total caffeine intake** for the day (coffee + energy drinks + pre-workout adds up fast).
* If you feel **chest tightness, dizziness, abnormal heartbeat, or severe anxiety**, stop use and seek medical advice.

Not medical advice — just common-sense guardrails for a heavy formula.



# Sport testing / compliance note (important)

If you compete in drug‑tested sport (or even if your job requires testing), be cautious. Some stimulants on labels can be treated as prohibited substances by anti‑doping programs, and supplement use is a common cause of adverse findings.

When in doubt: **avoid** high‑stim products and stick to third‑party tested options.



# Common “what will I feel?” expectations (very individual)

People typically report some mix of:

* Strong energy + alertness
* “Locked in” focus
* Elevated mood/drive
* Increased sweating / thermogenic feel
* Beta‑alanine tingles

Common downsides (especially at full scoop):

* Jitters, nausea, GI discomfort
* Elevated heart rate / feeling “wired”
* Anxiety/irritability
* Sleep disruption



# Community check-in (helpful comments format)

If you’ve used Maniaco, drop:

1. **Dose** (½ or 1 scoop)
2. **Timing** (minutes pre‑workout)
3. **Workout type** (lift/HIIT/etc.)
4. **Pros/cons** (focus, pumps, side effects)

That’s way more useful than “hits” / “doesn’t hit.”



# Fact-check sources

1qrddhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSMarketing/comments/1qrddhb/bad_messaging_or_no_messaging_whats_worse/,Bad Messaging or No Messaging: What's Worse?,"Having no messaging is as big a problem as having weak messaging. Let me explain.

An artisanal coffee shop opened down the street a few months back, and I just stopped by to check it out. The coffee drinks are fantastic, so I was pleasantly surprised.

However, a more glaring problem caught my attention – there was zero messaging anywhere. Despite several large picture windows, there were no posters or window text. Other than the café’s name, there was no noticeable marketing signage.

Let’s cut them some slack. It’s still a new business and I’m sure it’s on their priority list somewhere. It just should be higher on that list.

Look, when we go to market with a product or open for business, we need to have messaging that resonates. Otherwise, we have already lost business to competitors who have figured out this crucial step.

Let's look at one of the coffee shop's top competitors. It opened about two years ago with a similar layout on the other side of town. Two of its glass windows had messaging from the jump – “Fuel your daily rhythm” and a hand-drawn oval graphic with circular arrows and the text “rest” on top and “work” on the bottom.

The second cafe clearly understands the role coffee plays in the lives of its ideal customers – as a lifestyle choice that enables their work and life.

The drinks at the first café may be as good as the second café, but many potential customers wouldn’t know because they gave them no reason to try them.

Yes, this is B2C rather than B2B, but the concept still works.

You need to give your customers a reason to try your IT integration, financial compliance software, or commercial appliance. No messaging equals no interest.

Pushing features and specs or using vague benefits won’t cut it. Having no messaging will keep you invisible.",1,1769797114.0,SaaSMarketing,0,1.0,False

• hiking: Any decent trails within a 20-30 min drive? I’m down for winter hiking/mud season stuff.

1qrd86p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1qrd86p/destiny_review/,Destiny review,"Hi all,

Having benefitted massively from this sub before our trip, I thought I would share our experience of a Western Carribbean itinerary board the Destiny on 17-22 Jan.

Party:
Me, 30s M
My wife, 30s F
Our daughter, 2 F

All first time cruisers!

Itinerary:
Day 1: Depart Fort Lauderdale
Day 2: Day at Sea
Day 3: Cozumel, Mexico
Day 4: Day at Sea
Day 5: Castaway Cay
Day 6: Arrive Fort Lauderdale 

Pre-trip

Despite holding no Castaway Club status, I found it easy to book nursery time and a first night Palo dinner when our booking window opened. Thanks to the sub for highlighting the window dates. As we were coming from the UK, we didn’t receive any luggage tags in the mail.

Travel to FL

We booked through Virgin Holidays, and the cruise was the first part of a 2 week trip, which included a week at WDW. So we flew LHR-MIA, arriving early evening. After some trouble locating the hotel shuttle, we arrived at the Hilton Miami Airport Blue Lagoon to discover they had no record of our reservation! 

After 2 hours of chasing confirmation numbers and trying to resolve with Virgin over WhatsApp, we took an Uber to a Hilton on the beach at Fort Lauderdale. We were all exhausted by this point. I won't go into the details of our dispute with Virgin; suffice to say it's ongoing.

Embarkation

Arriving by Uber at Port Everglades was easy. As we had waited for our Port Arrival Time, we barely waited in line for security. Cleverly, the line is paced out by photo opps along the way, which my daughter loved. With a 12:45 PAT, we crossed the threshold at 13:20. While we waited for our stateroom to be ready, we ate lunch in Marceline Market- I would recommend the chicken tikka!

Our assembly drill was at 15:30; we were assigned to Worlds of Marvel restaurant. We have nothing to compare to, but I agree with other comments that the style of drill is old-fashioned and just causes impatience and anxiety with the crowds. Nevertheless, it was conducted efficiently and we were on our way.

The sail away party was excellent and didn't feel as crowded as I expected from watching videos online.

Our stateroom

We chose a midship port side cabin on deck 10 with a verandah. I was very happy with our choice, a great view to the stern, minimal noise and very comfortable. Our daughter loved the Baymax theme.

TV highlights include Bridge Report (think moving map on a flight), Bridge View (an HD camera feed facing forward) and prerecorded versions of the stage shows. You can access the TV channels on your phone- this is a little fiddly, especially if you just want to check the bridge report.

We didnt see much of our stateroom host, he remarked we were always out when he came to see us! Nevertheless, the room was always spotless and the towel animals were appreciated. 

Dining & service

I think this will be easiest to categorise by location:

Marceline Market: Decent enough for lunch and disembarkation breakfast. Plenty of choice, could be busy with people pushing their plates around.

1923: Very good for a calm breakfast. A nice selection for dinner,  affected somewhat by our server situation (see below).

Pride Lands: Excellent show with an interesting menu. Just be aware you may get a sore neck from turning round to watch the show.

Worlds of Marvel: Disappointing show tbh, the weaker interpretation without any character meets. Was quite boring for our daughter, especially when I had promised her a Spiderman dinner! For anyone booking on the Destiny, this is the only Wish class ship currently that doesn't do the full Marvel show 'Quantum Encounter'. Instead it is the Groot remix followed by a generic meal with rotating images on the screen. Food was good though. 

Mickey's Festival of Foods: Daisy's Pies was the highlight, followed by Donald's Cantina and Mickey's Smokestack BBQ. We didn’t get a chance to try Goofy's Grill. Basically, expect abundance rather than quality, but the staff are all very helpful.

Palo: The first night dinner was good, if expensive. I sensed a little pressure from the server to choose the more expensive items on the menu, but overall it was an excellent evening in a beautiful setting. It was dark outside during our meal; I imagine it would be even better at sunset.

With regards to service, again, as first time cruisers, our comparisons are limited. However, we didn’t see our allocated server until night 4. This was due to us heading to Palo on night 1, followed by our server taking time off for a minor operation. This is of course completetly understandable, but it did affect us in two ways.

1) The stand-in server did his best to accommodate our needs, but he was obviously pushed for capacity and wasn't able to build the fabled rapport with us.

2) We prepaid our gratuities, so received envelopes with pre-assigned vouchers for us to distribute to server, assistant server, head server and stateroom host. However, we weren't able to adjust these amounts or assign some to our stand-in server. We did enquire about this with Guest Services, who said flexibility was limited with prepaid gratuities. 

We also felt awkward about handing envelopes to individuals with vouchers inside rather than cash. It was a moot point anyway, as we didn’t catch our slot for disembarkation breakfast. This meant we left the tips to be allocated automatically.

Entertainment and Characters

This was a real highlight of our trip, especially for our daughter. Character meets are plentiful and easy to plan using the Navigator app. Lines are shorter than in the park, but be aware that the character may swap to a different one if you are at the back of the line.

We used an autograph book and a polaroid camera, which will make some great memories along with the photopass pictures and our own phones.

Make sure to check out the final farewell to ""mop up"" any last meets, particularly of the Sensational Six.

We didn't take part in any trivia, quizzes or comedy events, but we did drop in on a couple of dance parties- shout out to the cast members finding the energy to raise the roof at 0845!

The evening shows were outstanding, with both Hercules and Frozen keeping our daughter's attention. We were told that the matinees are often crazy busy, so we stuck to the performance opposite our dining time. The late toddler bedtimes were worth it.

Deck parties and pirate night were all awesome, I'm glad we joined in with costumes.


Port Visits

Port visits were a lower priority for us on our first cruise. 

Cozumel was a typical cruise port with lots of local merchandise available immediately on arrival, some of which was questionable in quality/provenance. If we had decided to take an excursion, it would have been to a private beach. In the end, we wandered for an hour or two before returning to the ship and enjoying a quieter period.

Castaway Cay was fantastic. As I'll mention below, the weather was changeable and the winds meant our planned glass bottomed boat tour was cancelled. Honestly, I was glad about that. It allowed us to have a more leisurely stroll off the ship, followed by a great day of character meets, sandcastle building, slide riding and eating BBQ. I hired a bike to go out to Serenity Bay. The return trip took about 45 minutes.

Shopping

We didn't spend too much time in the high end shops, although we saw plenty guests who did.

The Disney focused shops had a wide selection, but with high prices. We didn't experience any stock shortages, but we took our time to create a shortlist for each of us before making a final decision on souvenirs.

Kids Clubs/Splash pad

Our daughter was too toung for Oceaneer's Club, but she did benefit from the open house events and the nursery. Mickey and Minnie's Captain Deck was a particular highlight.

One on occasion, the friendly and dedicated nursery staff let us know our daughter was unsettled, but the message wasn't an urgent ""collect her now!"". We went down to see her and checked her out early, and were even refunded the portion of unused time!

We couldn't spend too much time in the pools since our daughter is in progress with potty training. But the Toy Story splash pad was a real hit, she could have been in there all day.

Weather

Somewhat typical for January, we had a mix of clouds and sun with about 1.5 days of strong winds (up to 50kts apparent wind). This caused some ship motion, which we felt more significantly on lower decks. We took sickness meds ones as a precaution and it impacted our Marvel dinner slightly (no windows!) Overall, we coped much better than expected.


Premium coffee/bars

Let's not beat around the bush, alcoholic drinks on board are expensive. But given our party, we didn't feel the need to get drunk- we were happy to try a speciality cocktail once or twice per day.

I was skeptical about the premium coffee offering, but I actually enjoyed this more than the bars. This was mainly due to the very cool latte art printers which can put an array of characters and logos on your drink. I loved getting up early, strolling round the outdoor decks before bringing back two coffees with characters which would excite my daughter. 

One improvement I think would increase coffee sales would be the provision of a character catalogue. I'm sure plenty of seasoned cruisers would be interested in completing the set, rather than asking the barista in the hope their favourite character is available. 


Ship Facilities

The ship is beautiful with some great spaces like the Haunted Mansion parlour. The decoration, artwork and comfort all made for a captivating experience. Even the hallowed DCL scent added to our overall impression (impactes only slightly by the ugly diffusers plugged in around common spaces).

We didn't get to experience:

-Enchanté
-Hero Zone
-Triton Lounge
-Cask and Cannon (too much American Football being shown 😆)
-The tween/teen clubs
-Dr Facilier
-The cinemas! We took a look around and they are well designed, the showtimes just didn't line up for us.

I also signed up to the ship tour, which was focused mainly on aesthetic design and artwork on decks 3-5 (so no bridge or backstage action). It was an insightful hour and included a sneak peek at the Spiderman stern artwork from the windows of Pride Lands.



TL;DR

-Easy embarkation
-Fantastic stateroom
-Generally happy with food and restaurant variety.
-Quick service, room service and soft drinks all easily accessible.
-Amazing entertainment
-Cozumel meh, CC excellent
-Now trying to decide if we can justify another trip!

# Bad Case

Doc wouldn’t go home yet. Not until he fixed his mistakes.

*Click.*

The recording played Doc’s own voice back at him—one last check before sending his confession away.

**Patient Log. Subject: ""Pav."" Surname unknown. Status: Ward of the state.**

**Timestamp: 15 July, 2055. 04:04 Hours.**

**Practitioner: Dr. Remington Ailuva. This log serves as a formal admission of ethics violations and breach of the Hippocratic Oath…I also break my oath to the ones I owe everything to.**

*Click.*

Remy paused the recording and scratched a few lines onto a large yellow envelope. The body of the comatose young man, Pav, had been moved to the doctor’s laboratory.

*Click.*

**Subject is a sixteen-year-old male, admitted following high-impact vehicular trauma. Subject was enrolled as a primary test-subject for APEX R&D. Subject was administered the 'Amber' compound via intravenous injection, utilizing the provided black-matter substrate as a biological catalyst.**

*Click.*

Two tubes, each jammed into Pav’s abdomen, slowly drained fluids from the unconscious boy. A dark, amber-colored, molasses-like fluid flowed into a glass beaker, while a jet-black, filmy slime dripped into a glass enclosure containing more of the blackened grime.

Remy took several pictures: Pav, the amber, the substance. Each flash briefly illuminated the darkened laboratory, causing the amber to flash gold and the substance to shine a deep, dark blue. The doctor shook the Polaroids dry before sliding them into the envelope.

*Click.*

**Tissue regeneration was exponential; skeletal fractures and internal hemorrhaging were resolved within a 72-hour window. The catalyst appears to act as a predatory necrotic filler—consuming and replacing non-viable tissue in the absence of natural cellular mitosis.**

**During the one-week observation period of active treatment, the subject exhibited acute neurobiological side effects. Symptoms included intense audiovisual hallucinations and REM-stage cognitive disturbances. Subject reported recurring thematic dreams involving a 'well' of the catalyst and perceived communication with the biological source of the Amber compound.**



The doctor’s eyes were puffy and red from a combination of grief and exhaustion. He wiped his face, printed out Pav’s patient files, and let the tape continue.

**Upon cessation of treatment, the subject remained stable for seven days. No physiological abnormalities were noted, though the subject continued to report intrusive, fixation-heavy dreams regarding the Amber donor.**

**On July 13th, 2055, the subject sustained a lethal electrical discharge during an unauthorized attempt to vacate the facility.**

*Ding.*

Remy jumped as the electronic chime startled him. The fluid drain was complete. He grabbed the beaker of dark amber and poured the contents into a centrifuge. With the press of a button, the device began to spin, further separating the black catalyst from the golden amber. The doctor’s computer screen illuminated a roiling, black substance swirling within the confines of the glass enclosure. A sticky film clung to the glass where the living ooze had attempted to climb.

**Subsequent analysis confirms that Subject…Pav. Pav survived the terminal event. However, the subject is now physiologically dependent on the Amber compound. Depletion of the substance triggers immediate, systemic withdrawal and cellular collapse.**

The black ooze began to slow as the moisture was sucked from its enclosure. The slime trails dried and clung to the glass like wet lint. Once the slime had stopped moving, Remy opened the top of the enclosure and scooped a chunk out. He plopped the cup of dry crud into a centripetal machine and closed the enclosure. The creature spasmed angrily as the moisture returned to its prison.

**I owe APEX… everything… but I can’t continue. I broke both oaths, but at least I can atone for one. I must atone.**

The doctor pulled a container of golden amber fluid from its refrigerated chamber. The rest of the rack now stood bare. He poured the last of the amber into the mixer before plunging a new tube into Pav’s chest. The newly mixed dark amber hungrily flowed through the tube and into its unconscious host.

**Pav, if you ever get to hear this… I’m sor—**

*Click.*

Remy spun to find a single, dark silhouette standing there, the tape recorder held in one hand.

***BANG.***

Doc fell to the floor, searing pain causing his vision to darken. The figure wrenched the tube from Pav’s chest, letting the dark amber spill onto the tiles.

“What a waste, Doc.”

“Just… leave the boy alone! I can still he—”

Remy’s mouth filled with blood. He violently retched onto the floor. The intruder kicked the doctor—once, twice, three times for good measure. Remy could hear the sounds of glass shattering, equipment being trashed, and the crackling of flames as his lab was ransacked.

***BANG. BANG.***

The doctor heard two final gunshots ring out before all his senses went black.









# Last Chance

The drive back to Oakdale was a long one, but Mary had just spent a week in the hospital, so a three-hour trip wasn’t that bad. She got to catch up on her DMs, create several shitposts that made sense only to her, and blather loudly with her mom. Not much happened in the town Mary currently inhabited, though it had once been prosperous due to its abundance of oak trees. Drug addicts shambled in packs, high on the latest party drug. Younger kids sequestered themselves inside their parents’ homes, their lives spent primarily on the internet.

It was a great place to practice witchcraft, unless your coven hated you and wanted you dead. Mary’s mother pulled the little sedan up to her dilapidated mobile home.

“Okay, Mamacita, time to go back in your cage!”

“Sí, mija, I love you!” Mary’s “mother” had a high-pitched, chirping voice that sounded ecstatic at the idea of being put in a cage. Her eyes rolled back into her head as a tiny finch wetly pushed its way out of her mouth. The empty corpse turned to snow before rapidly melting, drenching the interior of the car. Mary scooped the tiny mom-bird up and plunked her into a small birdcage. With a roll of her wrist, the cage disappeared.

“Home, sweet home!”

As soon as Mary stepped out of the car, it rapidly rusted. With a wrenching of ancient metal, the former vehicle collapsed in on itself before a gust of wind carried the pile of rust away. Mary noticed a large pile of dust sitting on her front porch, a pair of glasses resting on top.

“Jane, you dumb bitch.”

Mary carefully stepped over the pile and made her way inside. Her cat briefly looked up at her from his position on the couch before going back to cleaning his own butthole.

“Cool, I missed you, too.”

She grabbed a dustpan and a broom before heading back outside to sweep up the pile. Once she was done, Mary carefully slid the dust into a glass jar. She made her way back into the kitchen and added some week-old coffee grounds, a spoonful of cinnamon, and a cup of pomegranate juice to the dust jar. Her concoction was placed on the carpet, between the CRT TV with an ancient gaming console attached to it and the couch where her cat continued to groom himself.

*“Por los poderes del aquelarre, que me odia.”*

Mary used one of her long, acrylic nails to slice open the palm of her left hand. She sat on the ground and churned the contents of the jar in a counter-clockwise motion with her bleeding hand.

*“Con la autoridad de mi madre bruja, que también me odia.”*

The contents of the jar began to swirl into a noxious-looking brown gunk. A pair of eyes coalesced within the newly mixed filth. They were joined by a filmy line of a mouth that began to sputter against the muffling glass.

*“Traigan de vuelta a esta estúpida zorra, Jane.”*

A disembodied voice issued forth from the jar. “Mary! You piece of shit! You disintegrated me!”

Mary hocked a loogie into the jar before closing the top. “Bitch! You came to kill me! You’re lucky you were stupid enough to get caught in the first trap!”

“Wow, this is how you treat your best friend? I came to warn you about the coven and you bring me back as sludge in a jar?!”

“You lyin’ ho. I already know they chose you to kill me. You’re lucky to be sludge; I should’ve left you as dust!”

“Then you should’ve been a good friend and let me kill you! You know I’m trying to move up in the coven!”

Mary picked up the Jane-jar and gave it a furious shaking. She placed the jar on a shelf above the TV while the floating eyes attempted to reorient themselves. The exhausted witch angrily stalked off to get some much-needed rest in her bedroom.

“Wait! Don’t leave me like this! At least let me watch TV! All I can see is your cat eating his own asshole! Please!









# Apex

Agent Seth left the hospital, a glass enclosure held under one arm. One of the many autonomous cars—that his company kept—waited for him outside, ready to drive him back to APEX HQ. He preferred to walk. The agent placed the enclosure in the trunk, along with the separated amber sample, and sent the car ahead without him. The frigid air of the city did nothing to quell his boiling blood.

The city wouldn’t officially “wake up” for another hour or so, but the streets were still occupied by people who had over-enjoyed the nightlife. Homelessness had long since been made illegal, but that didn’t stop vagrants from taking “temporary rests” near whatever source of warmth they could find. The grisly work of the last hour had set him on edge. Innocent bums and drug-addled burnout yuppies wouldn’t cut it tonight.

Cutting through alleyways at 5:00 AM was not what the average citizen would consider wise, but Seth was looking to make unwise decisions.

“Nice suit, ape.”

Perfect. A group of young bippers were breaking into a car nearby. Their porcelain pieces pierced the windows, sending glass shattering inside. These opportunistic criminals weren’t above robbing a man if he looked well-off. Seth’s all-black suit, gloves, and expensive shades were tempting targets for any thief, even if they did mark him as an APEX agent.

“What’s an ape like you doin’ on our turf?”

“Funny, I don’t see a sign that says ‘Bitch Boy Territory’ anywhere. I must’ve missed it.”

The two thugs who weren’t looting the car came over to confront him.

“Ooh hoo hoo! We’ve got a comedian here!”

The first thug had an old revolver tucked into the band of his sagging pants. The second thug not-so-subtly flashed a knife in the agent’s direction.

“This is the territory of Jack the Bipper, ape. He doesn’t like your kind in his territory, flashing your nice clothes like you mean something, ya feel? Why don’t you leave your stuff with us and bounce on outta here, monkey boy.”

“I didn’t realize we were in the Castro, boys. I get that it’s SF, but you can’t just ask a man to take off his clothes. At least buy me dinner first.”

The first thug gave Seth a sarcastic “ha ha” before pulling the gun from his pants and shoving it into the agent’s face. Seth deftly grabbed the thug’s wrist and wrenched the gun toward the second thug, who was coming in hot with the knife.

***BANG***

The knife went flying out of the second thug’s hand. His flabbergasted expression was interrupted by Seth’s boot colliding with his face.

***BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG*** ***click click click***

Seth grabbed the first thug’s hand and forced him to empty the gun into the wall. The agent kicked the discarded knife far away from the ensuing melee before hitting the first thug square in the jaw with a vicious uppercut. Seth took a step back and slowly pulled his own gun out between two fingers. He made a point of placing the firearm on a nearby trash can before stepping back toward the confused thugs.

“Attack a man, two-on-one, while he’s unarmed, and this is the result? Disappointing.”

The remainder of the gang—two other thugs still standing aghast by the half-looted car—joined their friends. The group of four exchanged a look before jumping Seth all at once. The smiling agent gleefully took blows to the face, sides, and stomach that he could have easily dodged. Seth laughed it all off as he threw wild haymakers into the faces of all four thugs.

“This is how it should be, boys!”

“Man, you fuckin’ crazy! Shut yo ass up!”

Seth traded punch after punch until the gang stopped swinging. Battered and bruised, the agent left the four men unconscious in the alley before completing the rest of his journey. The thrill of it all had worn off by the time he entered The Emperor hotel. He had gotten what he needed… for now.

1qrczpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1qrczpo/navigating_friendship_anxiety/,Navigating friendship anxiety,"I’ve posted on here before that I really miss deeper friendships. I lately feel lonely and often crave more meaningful, consistent connection.

What I’m realizing is that when opportunities for closeness actually come up lately, I panic and want to cancel. I convince myself people are only reaching out to appease me or that the interaction won’t be fulfilling. It’s become a self-fulfilling loop: I want closeness, avoid it when it appears, and then feel even more isolated.

A current example is a coffee date with a longtime “best friend” from college. We’re at very different life stages now (she has young kids; I don’t), and our conversations usually center on her life while she rarely asks about mine. I’m anxious the meetup will feel one-sided, which makes me want to pull away even more.

I told her I’m feeling disconnected and anxious and that I’m tempted to cancel because I don’t feel like I would be much fun and don’t want to put a damper on her already chaotic schedule. She insists we still meet, but I’m struggling to build up the courage to go and honestly want to bail the more I think about it because of the anxiety. 

In our larger friend group, everyone seems busy but still checks in with each other, while I’m often left out. I’ve thought about telling them I feel lonely, but I worry it’ll come across as self-absorbed or insensitive to what others have going on.

So I'm trying to pre-fill my itinerary as much as possible.

I'm noticing I'm having a hard time finding companies that do not require you to have a minimum of 2 people.  

I don't want to pay for a secondary person, because well, it's just me.

I'd like to find a cooking/coffee experience, for either Feb 27th or 28th.

Are their any smaller or independent tour comanies/people in the area that can arrange these including transport?

Would it be better for me to reach out to these places (co-op, oxmul) on my own to coordinate and just taxi hop from one to another when I'm done.

How reliable are the taxis for drop offs and timely returns?  I'm used to Uber, and haven't used taxi coordination in about 15 years.  So a little out of my element on this one.

I made a few modifications to suit my liking. 

Recipe 👇🏾 I saw on YouTube. The channel name is yummylittlebelly

THE EASIEST SWEET POTATO CINNAMON ROLLS!🧡

For the dough:

\- 200g (1 cup) sweet potato, peeled and cooked

\-190g (1 ½ cups) self-raising flour

\- 40g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted

—I added 

2-4 tablespoons brown sugar 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

1-2 tablespoons cinnamon 

You may have to add more flour because of this. I think I added an extra 4-8 tablespoons 

For the filling:

\- I used about 50 grams of mashed sweet potato 

1/4 cup sugar free sweetened condensed milk (optional)

\- added cinnamon (I eyeballed it)

\- brown sugar  (I eyeballed it)

\- 3 tablespoons of butter, melted (optional)

For a Brown butter frosting:

\-I used 1-2 tablespoons browned butter I made it the day before and warmed up in the microwave for about 12 seconds.

\- I used 4 oz of softened cream

\-1/4 cup powdered sugar( I made my own. I blitzed a 1/4 cup of cane sugar in a coffee grinder) 

\- you could used Coconut sugar or brown sugar

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F.

2. In a medium bowl, mash the sweet potato with a fork. Then add self-raising flour and melted butter, and mix to form a dough. If the dough is too sticky, gradually add more flour, but avoid adding too much to prevent the cinnamon rolls from becoming too hard.

3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle approximately 1 centimeter thick.

4. Brush the top with melted butter, or the mashed sweet potato, then sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar.

5. Starting from the long edge, roll the dough into a sausage shape.

6. Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into 6-8 individual rolls.

7. Place the slices on a muffin tin or baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes.

8. Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool. While they’re cooling, prepare the brown butter cream cheese frosting. 

9. Buon appetito!

👶🏻 Suitable from 24+ months.

❄️ Store in the fridge in an airtight container for 2-3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

To reheat after freezing: Thaw the cinnamon rolls in the refrigerator overnight. Then, reheat in the oven at 180°C/350°F for about 5-10 minutes, or until warmed through.",7,1769796086.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

A bit of an unconventional pick, I know – but it seems the Knicks have remembered how to play basketball, and their defense has been solid. New York has held each of their last 4 opponents to 109 points or less, and Portland hasn’t bagged more than 98 points in 2 of their last 3 games. My money’s on the Knicks defense to hold it down here at home. Take Portland to stay Under 109.5.

I finished the last interview an hour ago and I’m sure I didn’t get the job. 

So I log into the call under my teams account. Put myself on mute while I wait for all to show up. The cofounder joined and said hi and said the client would be joining shortly and to let him talk. Client joins and the cofounder wants to do introductions. Without missing a beat he introduces me as their new addition to the team, blah blah title and experience. Everyone says hello and introduce themselves. I stay quiet during all this time. 

Small talk over and into project details and expectations. Talk about deadlines and how I’m expected to be onsite for the first 3 months with the customer because they want someone to be there during the initial project phase 1. Cofounder talks and say we can do that and if needed I can do longer. He sounds so sure and dedicated. Details are explained and cue questions to me. 

I take myself off mute and simply ask if this is an interview or am I already hired because I have yet to sign any paperwork or have any discussion regarding pay and benefits. I continue on and explained that it is highly unethical to have me lie and pretend to be part of a company where I have yet started and have yet agreed to work with. I apologized to the client and say they lied to him and I am not sure what they told him but the company simply told me this was an interview for a job and I had zero commitments to be onsite anywhere and I wasn’t even sure that would work out. 

Before I could say or do anything further I got removed from the meeting. Minutes later, my phone is blowing up from the recruiter and a few other numbers which might be them. I let it go to voicemail and right now I’m enjoying my coffee and a muffin. ",23,1769795997.0,recruitinghell,8,0.96,False

It's extremely difficult to explain this to my family, as they have claimed that I'm ""intentionally neglecting myself"" and ""have a serious problem"". I got into an argument with my mum about this and it's exhausting to try and explain it to her every time it happens (this is the 5th or 6th time), she thinks I have a 'psychological problem with food'. It is extremely difficult to bring myself to eat anything, even if I'm really hungry, and my thought process is ""I really want to eat something but nothing is right"", it happens in patches and usually when I have flares. 

My mum will present me with food and claims it's unpleasant to sit with me whilst she eats, because I'm mentally restraining myself from eating despite showing the mannerisms of someone who is hungry. I'm sorry I'm so unpleasant to be around, but what is going through my head is not ""oh I better not eat this just so I should neglect my lupus and piss you off!"" it is: ""this food is not what I want, everything I have thought about eating is repulsive and my body does not feel like it physically wants food"". It's not as if I'm skipping meals deliberately either as I'm not even drinking coffee, or soft drinks like I usually would, she sees this!!! Everything I usually like feels awful, and nobody believes that I am telling the truth.

  
Maybe it's because I'm a young woman, and we're bombarded with content about diet culture and 'staying skinny', and I suppose that's her immediate assumption, but this so clearly happens in phases around my flares and she never listens?!! It is so exhausting having to explain and argue this to her every time it happens.

1qrcrgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenRituals/comments/1qrcrgn/feng_shui_home_layout_guide_redditstyle/,"Feng Shui Home Layout Guide (Reddit-Style): Principles, Practical Tips & What to Avoid","If you’ve ever walked into a home and felt like it was instantly *calmer* (or instantly *chaotic*), Feng Shui is basically a structured way of diagnosing *why*—then fixing it with layout, light, airflow, and “supportive” placement.

This isn’t about turning your apartment into a temple or buying a bunch of cures. Think of it as a **home layout checklist** that nudges your space toward: smoother movement, less visual stress, better rest, and fewer daily friction points.

https://preview.redd.it/ibc4z1fgzigg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=046a0b5220b43efca2b4648c4de3212c40f442e9

# TL;DR

* Start with **flow**: clear pathways, fewer bottlenecks, less clutter.
* Prioritize **entry + bedroom**: they influence first impressions and recovery/sleep.
* Aim for **support + visibility**: seats and beds feel better when they’re “backed” and you can see the door.
* Avoid the big “leaks”: clutter piles, sharp corners aimed at you, mirrors in the wrong places, and neglected repairs (especially water issues).

# 1) The “Core Principles” (aka why [Feng Shui](https://monianlife.com/blogs/feng-shui) advice repeats itself)

# 1) Flow (Qi = movement, not magic)

In practice this means:

* You can walk through rooms without zig-zagging.
* Doors can open fully.
* Nothing “attacks” your attention the second you enter (visual clutter, piles, chaotic cords).

**Quick test:** If you’re constantly bumping into things or stepping around stuff, the layout is fighting you.

# 2) Balance (too much of anything feels off)

* Too dark → heavy/low energy, harder to stay motivated.
* Too bright/harsh → agitating, hard to wind down.
* Too empty → cold/unstable feeling.
* Too packed → oppressive.

# 3) Support (your body relaxes when it feels protected)

This is why Feng Shui loves:

* Solid headboards
* Chairs with backs
* Sitting/working with a wall behind you (or at least something “anchoring” you)

# 4) Clarity (your space should “tell you” what to do)

* Bedroom should clearly be for rest.
* Office corner should clearly be for focus.
* Dining area should invite actual meals (not become storage).

# 2) Start Here: The Entryway (the most underrated fix)

Your front door is basically your home’s “mouth.” Even if you don’t buy into that, the entryway sets your nervous system’s tone.

**Do:**

* Keep it **bright enough** (warm light > cold, hospital light).
* Make it **easy to enter**: shoes/keys/bag have a home.
* Clean the door, handle, and threshold (small thing, big psychological impact).
* Use a simple “landing zone” (tray, hook, slim console).

**Avoid:**

* A blocked entry (boxes, bikes, random stacks).
* A mirror that reflects the front door *immediately* (it can feel like energy/attention bounces out—also it’s just jarring).

# 3) Living Room: Set it up for connection, not obstacle courses

**Do:**

* Arrange seating so people can talk without shouting across a void.
* If possible, place the main sofa **with a wall behind it** (support).
* Add one “softening” element: rug, curtain, throw—helps calm the space visually.
* Keep pathways clear around coffee tables and corners.

**Avoid:**

* Furniture shoved randomly against every wall (often creates a weird “empty center + awkward edges” vibe).
* Sharp corners pointed directly at the main sitting spot (if unavoidable, soften with a plant, round table, or reposition).

# 4) Bedroom: The “Command Position” without being dramatic

This is where Feng Shui is most practical: better placement can improve *comfort* and reduce bedtime alertness.

**Best-practice placement:**

* Bed where you can **see the door** but you’re **not directly in line** with it.
* **Headboard against a solid wall** (not floating in the room).
* Two sides accessible if possible (more balanced, less cramped).

**Do:**

* Use a solid headboard (or at least something stable).
* Choose calm, layered lighting (overhead + bedside).
* Keep under-bed storage minimal and soft items only (if you must store).

**Avoid:**

* Bed directly aligned with the door (many people sleep more lightly like this).
* Heavy shelves or bulky objects over the bed (safety + subconscious tension).
* Mirrors reflecting the bed (can feel restless; also increases visual stimulation at night).

# 5) Kitchen: Where “health + wealth” talk becomes… basic maintenance

Even if you ignore the symbolism, kitchens affect routines: eating, budgeting, energy levels.

**Do:**

* Keep the stove clean and functional (it’s literally where food happens).
* Fix leaks fast (water issues = ongoing stress + actual damage).
* Keep knives and sharp tools stored neatly (less visual aggression).
* Balance fire/water vibes: don’t let the sink + stove “fight” if they’re right next to each other—use a small buffer (wood cutting board, plant, neutral counter space).

**Avoid:**

* Cluttered counters that kill your desire to cook.
* Broken appliances you “mean to fix” for months (constant low-grade stress signal).

# 6) Bathroom: Contain “drain” energy (and keep it fresh)

Bathrooms are literally drainage spaces—Feng Shui just gives that a symbolic layer.

**Do:**

* Close the toilet lid (hygiene + visually calmer).
* Ventilation matters: keep it dry, fix mold.
* Keep it bright and clean, use a subtle scent if you like.

**Avoid:**

* Leaks, dampness, mold (this is non-negotiable for a healthy home).
* Bathroom door facing the entry or kitchen with no separation—if that’s your layout, add a visual buffer (plant, screen, runner, artwork).

# 7) Home Office: Make focus easier

**Do:**

* Desk so you can **see the door**, or at least not have your back to it.
* Add “support” behind you (wall, tall bookshelf, credenza).
* Keep cords managed and surfaces clear enough to start work in 30 seconds.

**Avoid:**

* Working in bed long-term (blurs sleep/work boundaries; your brain doesn’t love it).
* Sitting with your back to the door with no support (many people feel subtly on-edge).

# 8) Clutter: The boring advice that actually works

Feng Shui people call it stagnant energy. Everyone else calls it *decision fatigue*.

**A realistic approach (not minimalist cosplay):**

* Clear floors first (instant relief).
* Clear surfaces second (visual calm).
* Organize storage last (so you don’t just shuffle mess into drawers).

**High-impact clutter zones:**

* Entryway
* Bedside tables
* Kitchen counters
* The chair that becomes a clothing mountain

# 9) “What to Avoid” (Common Feng Shui Red Flags)

* **Blocked doors/windows** → stuck flow + less light/air.
* **Mirrors that cause jump-scares** (reflecting the bed or front door).
* **Sharp corners aimed at where you sit/sleep**.
* **Too many competing focal points** (TV + loud art + clutter + bright overhead light).
* **Neglected repairs** (especially water leaks, mold, broken locks).
* **Overdecorating with “cures”** (your home shouldn’t feel like a shop display).

# 10) How fast does this “work”?

* **Immediate:** clearing pathways, improving lighting, reducing clutter.
* **A few days to weeks:** sleep improvements, mood stability, routines (because habits adjust).

# 11) Important note (because Reddit will ask)

Feng Shui is not a replacement for **medical, engineering, or safety** advice. If you’ve got mold, electrical issues, structural problems, or serious sleep/health concerns—handle those directly. Use Feng Shui as a complementary layout and lifestyle checklist.

I'd stop obsessing over my bank account, stop doing mental math every time I bought coffee, stop feeling that weird knot in my stomach about money. Yeah, that's not what happened.

Look, more money definitely helped with the obvious stuff. I stopped panicking about bills. Groceries became normal instead of stressful. But that background hum of worry? It didn't go away. It just morphed into something else. Now instead of ""do I have enough,"" it was ""am I doing this right?"" Am I saving enough? Investing smart? Why does my account seem lower than it should be when I didn't even buy anything major?

Here's the weird part: I started checking my accounts more after I started earning more. Not because anything was wrong, just because I needed... I don't know, proof? Reassurance? And the reassurance would last maybe a day before I needed another hit.

It took me way too long to realize the actual problem wasn't the dollar amount. It was all the uncertainty. Money coming in and going out at random times. Subscriptions I forgot existed suddenly charging me. Bills that weren't even that expensive but always seemed to show up at the worst moment. My brain was basically running a spreadsheet 24/7 in the background, and it was exhausting.

The thing that really got me is that the calm I was looking for never came from optimizing harder or making more. It came from just knowing what to expect. From not having to keep a running tally in my head at all times.

I'm still working on this, but I think maybe the whole ""financial peace"" thing has less to do with your income and more to do with how much noise money makes in your daily life. And turns out, making more doesn't automatically quiet things down.",2,1769795792.0,self,1,1.0,False
1qrcozw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePureContent/comments/1qrcozw/why_some_vpns_feel_slow_server_location/,"Why Some VPNs Feel Slow: Server Location, Congestion, and Simple Fixes That Work","Ever connected to a VPN and felt like your internet just hit the brakes? You're not alone. While VPNs are awesome for privacy, streaming, and securing data on public Wi-Fi, they can sometimes feel... sluggish. But don't worry—it’s usually not the end of the world. Most speed issues have simple explanations, and even simpler fixes.

Let’s break it down.

**1. Server Location Matters More Than You Think**

When you connect to a VPN server far away (like halfway across the world), your data has to travel more. More distance = more latency. It’s like sending a letter across the country instead of across the street—it just takes longer. The fix? Choose a server closer to your actual location unless you're specifically trying to appear elsewhere for content or privacy reasons.

**2. Congestion Isn’t Just for Highways**

Popular servers get crowded, especially during peak hours. Think of it like a coffee shop with only one barista—things slow down when everyone shows up at once. A congested VPN server might throttle your speed simply because it's handling too many users. Switching to a less crowded server often helps a lot.

**3. Your Own Internet Might Be the Bottleneck**

Let’s not forget—VPNs can’t magically fix a bad connection. If your base internet is slow or inconsistent, adding a VPN might make it feel worse. Before blaming the VPN, run a quick speed test without it and compare.

**4. Outdated Devices or Software Can Slow You Down**

Old routers, outdated VPN apps, or even an ancient laptop can become the weak link. Make sure your software is up to date, and if you’re using a VPN on a router, check that it has the processing power to handle encryption without choking.

**5. The Protocol You Use Makes a Difference**

VPNs offer different connection protocols (like OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, etc.). Some are faster, others more secure. Switching to a different protocol within your VPN settings can often balance speed and security better for your needs.

**Final Thoughts**

A slow VPN doesn’t mean a bad VPN. With a few tweaks—like switching servers, updating your gear, or tweaking your settings—you can often boost performance in minutes. Think of it like tuning a car engine. Once you get it right, the ride is smooth, safe, and speedy.",1,1769795732.0,ThePureContent,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend never took responsibility for any of the damage, and I had to replace everything myself. He doesn’t train the dog in any way — the dog is not leash-trained, and every walk makes me anxious that he might get hit by a car. He doesn’t know basic commands and is allowed to do absolutely anything.

Since the beginning of our relationship, the dog has snapped at me several times. I asked my boyfriend to start training him and to deal with the situation. He went to training once, but never showed up again.

2 weeks ago, the situation happened again. They had been staying at my place for a longer time, and yesterday I was taking laundry off the couch when the dog snapped at my hand. My boyfriend did nothing about it; just picked the dog up and tried to calmly reason with him in a soft voice, telling him he shouldn’t do that, and he wanted me to pet him. This made me even more upset..then he just promised he would contact the trainer and deal with it. I asked him that I did not want the dog to sleep with us in the bed that night (the dog has already snapped at me in bed several times). He told me I was overreacting because he didn’t cause me any injury and that I was being vengeful.

He got offended and he stayed on the couch to sleep with the dog and during the night said that he would go home the next day.. The next morning, he didn’t even make me coffee. He refused to lie down next to me when the dog is not allowed on the bed, because the dog would whine. We argued again, broke up, and he went home. Its been 15 days of no contact between us.

My question is: did I overreact? I am also asking this as a woman who felt unprotected and pushed into second place after a household pet. But is this a matter of incompatibility between us, or was I being too strict? I would also like to hear the opinion of dog owners, the perspective of the other side — whether they would have acted like he did, whether this is normal, or whether it’s just me seeing it differently.

And what is the appropriate reaction if a dog snaps at you?

Thank you.

They just continue speaking with ChatGPT, drinking coffee, reading morning newspapers (in paper version - in my country, I can't even find it) and calling to clients afterwards by phone

So I built a very simple automation in n8n, that can be used for beginners to learn how AI works for real business task.

**I paste a TXT call transcript - it saves structured notes into a CRM (HubSpot, Zoho CRM, or Pipedrive).**

It came from a real pain point. I used to write notes manually, copy them into both, HubSpot and Zoho. It was every single day. Now I just drop the raw transcript into a form and it creates CRM records automatically. It looks simple, but it saves me a lot of time.

I expect your comments: “Don’t AI notetakers already integrate with CRMs?”. Suprisingly, many don't:

* Otter - no Pipedrive;
* Fathom - no Zoho or Pipedrive;
* tl;dv - no Zoho;
* Fireflies - no GoHighLevel;

Also, many small businesses don’t use AI notetakers at all - and still don't even know about that;

I made this workflow mainly for people who:

* only use ChatGPT as the only AI tool
* want to try automation but don’t know where to start
* feel AI is overhyped or too expensive for small teams
* keep hearing about n8n but don’t understand why people use it

It’s basically “learning by doing"" workflow for a real painful business task - a timewaster.

If anyone’s interested, I can share the workflow or explain how it works. Completely free, just DM me

**What about you: what small business tasks are painfull enough to automate right away?**

For the past few weeks, I’ve been feeling increasingly uncomfortable at my gym and even around my neighborhood because there’s this guy who seems to be following me. He’s probably in his 40s, and I just turned 17, so the age difference alone makes it feel off.

It all started when I noticed him at the gym a few times. At first, I thought it was a coincidence—he’d be on a machine nearby or just in the same class. But then I realized he always seemed to find a way to be near me, even when I switched equipment or changed my routine. Sometimes, I’d catch him glancing at me a bit too long, and once or twice, he tried to strike up a conversation, but it felt forced and awkward. I was polite but clear I wasn’t interested.

What really creeped me out was when I started seeing him outside the gym, around my neighborhood or at places I go regularly, like the coffee shop or the grocery store. I never told anyone at first because I wasn’t sure if I was just being paranoid, but it’s happened enough times now that I can’t ignore it. I even changed my running route to avoid crossing paths with him, but he sometimes shows up in places I wouldn’t expect.

I’ve started feeling anxious, like I’m being watched, and it’s making me dread going out alone. I’m considering telling the gym staff or maybe even the police, but I don’t want to make a big deal if I’m just overreacting. Has anyone dealt with something like this?

So this isn’t the first time this has happened to me. It’s too much tbh. But I made an off-handed but funny (to me) comment in a women forum (I only visit women, crafts, and this one essentially.) and got some lame and obvious “advice” about eating.  Like, eat small meals throughout the day. I responded between the autism and adhd that’s not possible, most of the time they don’t classify things as food. But this NT doubled down. 

Like obviously if I could just magic wand fix it, I’d be happier. Even when I got really into meal planning on like a 2 year special interest, I couldn’t force myself to eat. And that’s what it is. Yes I’m morbidly obese. But I go weeks where I cannot consume most anything. Like way less than 700 a day. It’s never resulted in weight loss. I’ve literally only lost weight when I’m eating a lot, even if the food is ‘bad for you’. But when I’m in the ‘cannot consume’ mode that’s it. I cannot consume. Sometimes I can’t even drink coffee. I mean chips, ice cream, chocolate, nothing. I once went a month on nothing but chocolate milk because I needed something to stop my stomach acid coming up. (I have a lot of stomach things too but again, I can’t force consumption. Including drinking.) 

When I was a teen my mom signed me up for weight watchers and they told her I had an eating disorder. Like I ate when I was hungry and could. Although the male NT doctor she took me to basically waived off the concerns, not because I didn’t have intentional disordered eating, but because I’m fat, so if I lost weight it’s fine. That’s a whole nother issue. 

Ironically I was able to eat a ton on ozempic. Like I could actually eat a salad without planning time for digestion (it normally feels heavy in my stomach.) I ate three meals a day like every day. I even had remarkably fewer stomach problems overall. But alas, insurance decided to withdraw it. (I’m 1 point from being diabetic. I’d like to not. My sister has to force feed/drink herself when the sugar says so.) 

Sorry for the vent. It’s just super frustrating that I clearly explain my experience and I’m either lying or stupid.  Like even when I could afford a doctor, there was nothing they could do. That one actual treatment did change my hormones or lower something - there’s a study in England about it helping some autists. But before that I’ve been on at least 4 different medications. Notwithstanding the energy it takes to go to the doctor, then introduce the medicine to your body, track the results, find out it failed and you wasted tons of money and energy on it.

I (33f) been sitting in the same part of the library at uni. Since the beginning there is this guy sitting in the same area as well. 

In the first few years I was still in a pretty bad relationship so there was no romantic interest, but since I saw him everyday I got used to his presence there. 
My relationship ended about two years ago and last year I felt ready to connect to people again. In the summer I noticed him and I running into each other at random places around Uni. There was always a brief moment of eye contact, everythin normal. 
But normal changed and I noticed him more and more and got curious. 
One day he came out of a building I was standing in front of with some friends and something happened, but I look him in the eyes and I just couldn't look away, was like hypnotized and couldn't even smile or something. He held my gaze until he left my field of vision. 
(There were other moments too when he looked at me or something happened to him and he checked if I noticed it, we had eye contact more often and a little prolonged, but never with a smile). 
That's when I decided to approach him. 

So one day when I left I went up to him and gave him my number on a piece of paper and told him that I would like to get a coffee or something with him and if he didn't want to that's fine as well. 

He never texted but approached me the week after and told me that he would be down for coffee but ""not more"". Which is fine, I would just like to fill in the blank spaces and whatever happens will happen. And I'm also fully aware that there is a possibility that we actually wouldn't get along at all. 

We sat a date for a Wednesday. I had therapy on that day and didn't expect the session to be so emotional. I cried a lot and so I only went to uni afterwards to gather my stuff I left there (went to uni before I went to therapy). I did not see him during that time and I could barley hold the tears in so l left. I had no way of letting him know that I wasn't in the right headspace. 
The next two days were awkward but the week after we spoke and I told him that I had bad day and that I still want to get that coffee and he was fine with it but we both were busy and couldn't make it, although we tried everyday for about a week, the last thing I told him was that I am in no rush. 

Then Christmas came and the Uni was closed. 
And now to my problem: 

Since we're back, we haven't talked. The first time I saw him he came around a corner I was heading towards and I wanted to greet him, but he saw me and looked flustered and looked down to the ground. Which made me confused and also a little insecure. I don't want him to feel uncomfortable because of me. But I also didn't do anything bad. 

We haven't talked at all since then but he smiled at me awkwardly when we passed each other. The other day he sat next to me and then changed seats after a couple or hours? The library was super full and the new seat was a better seat but I couldn't help but wonder if it also was because of me? 
I don't know what to do. 

He seems rather shy and I don't see him alot around other people. I want to talk to him to clear the air but I also don't want to cross any unspoken boundaries?? 
Also this entire situation is taking away space in my head I need for other things right now. 

Would another approach be okay you think? Just to tell him that I don't want him to feel uncomfortable and that I also don't want to feel uncomfortable? 
Or am I overthinking? 
Thx for any input

here is the truth that hurts: you cannot outwork a machine.

i spent years trying to be the ""hardest worker in the room."" i wrote every email. i sent every dm. i manually tracked every lead. i was proud of the grind. i was also broke.

then i stopped trying to be a writer and started being an architect.

i built a system that runs my entire growth strategy while i sleep. i don't have a marketing team. i don't have a va. i have a ""zero-employee agency"" that costs me about $20 a month to run.

here is the blueprint of Synthetix OS and how to replace ""hustle"" with ""leverage.""

1. The Trap of ""Manual Growth""

most of you in r/ growthhacking are stuck in the ""execution trap."" you think you need to write better hooks or find better hashtags.

wrong. you need volume.

in 2026, the game is distribution. if you are writing content for one platform at a time, you are losing to people who write once and publish everywhere instantly.

• Human Speed: 1 good post per hour.

• Agent Speed: 50 good posts per minute.

the math doesn't care about your feelings. the cost of a human doing this work is about $25.00 per task. the cost of an ai agent doing it is $0.05. that is a 500x difference.

2. The Engine: Why Zapier is Stealing Your Money

stop using zapier. please.

zapier charges you for every single ""task"" or step. if you build a machine that finds 1,000 leads, zapier sends you a bill that looks like rent.

the architect's choice is n8n.

• Own the Factory: you can put n8n on a cheap server for $6 a month.

• Run Forever: n8n charges per ""execution,"" not per step. you can run a complex workflow with 100 steps, and it costs the same as a simple one.

• Smart Connections: it connects deeply with ai tools like langchain, which allows you to build agents that can actually think, not just copy-paste.

3. The ""Content Alchemist"" (Turning One Idea into Many)

i don't stare at a blank page anymore. i use a process called content fracturing.

here is how the Synthetix OS workflow handles my growth:

• The Input: i record a messy voice note or drop a youtube video link into a folder.

• The Transcription: the system turns my voice into text using whisper.

• The Magic (The Brain): it sends that text to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

◦ why claude? because gpt-4o sounds like a robot. claude is better at writing like a human. it has a huge ""context window"" (it can remember more), so it doesn't forget who i am or what my brand sounds like.

• The Output: the agent splits that one idea into 15 assets:

◦ 3 linkedin posts (story, list, and controversial take).

◦ 1 twitter thread with viral hooks.

◦ 1 seo-friendly blog post.

◦ 1 newsletter email.

i do the work once. the machine does the distribution 15 times.

4. The ""Hunter"" (Finding Money While You Sleep)

posting content is nice. getting paid is better.

most people wait for leads to come to them. i built an agent to go get them. this module is called The Hunter.

• The Patrol: the agent watches reddit, linkedin, and twitter 24/7.

• The Intent Check: it doesn't just spam people. it uses ai to read comments. it looks for ""buying intent."" is someone complaining about a problem i can solve?.

• The Action: if the score is high (over 85/100), it finds their info and drafts a personalized message for me to send.

responding within 5 minutes increases your chance of winning by 80%. my agent responds in seconds. humans cannot compete with this speed.

5. The ""White Box"" Rule (Don't Trust, Verify)

the biggest fear is ""what if the ai says something stupid?""

i use white box operations.

this means everything is logged. i don't let the ai post automatically at first. i have it send everything to a simple dashboard (i use notion).

i wake up, check the drafts, hit ""approve,"" and go get coffee. the system does the heavy lifting; i provide the judgment. never let a robot run your reputation without a leash.

The Exit

i didn't build this because i love code. i built it because i hated being a slave to my own business.

this architecture the self-hosted n8n nodes, the notion dashboard, the specialized agents is what i call Synthetix OS.

it is not a product you buy. it is an infrastructure snapshot. it is the difference between a business that owns you and a machine that serves you.

stop trying to be a better employee for yourself. start building the replacement.

Me (33HLF) and my husband (38LLM, maybe he’s LL4me who knows) have been together for over 8 years, married for 6. I realise this month is the 4th anniversary of the last time I remember us having sex. 4th annual anniversary.

I think I’m done.

We have some regular physical interaction which is strictly limited to a peck on the lips or cheek. He’s fidgety even if I turn that into a kiss.

I don’t what the issue is, frankly. I’m no supermodel but I am not an ugly bridge troll either. I stay between 21-22 BMI, hair is normal, skin is fair and blemish free (fair considered ‘more attractive’ in our region of the world), not too short either but shorter than him. I am even the primary breadwinner of the house, he isn’t burdened with having to deal with financial stress either.

For the past 6 months, I’ve started to feel like I’m sexually harassing my own husband by complementing his body because he gives me a 🙂smile and then remembers he has to run an errand. If I initiate before sleeping he’s tired no matter what the day was like. If I initiate in the morning then he has to take a dump, which he’s done with only after it’s time for me to start working (I largely work from home).

We go to the same gym right now and something weird has happened to me this month. We started to take weights and functional training seriously this month, as a new years resolution thing. He’s aiming for a bodybuilder build, I just like having physical exercise to do since my job is sedentary. He asked a friend of his to train us since we’re new to weightlifting anything above 8kg.

His friend has a habit of saying good things to motivate me on tough reps and it feels WEIRD, man. Nothing inappropriate, he says stuff like ‘oh I got it wrong, I thought you’d only do 6 but you did 8!’ or ‘I can see your biceps are actually showing now. that tshirt shows them off!’ or ‘nice sweats, where did you get them?’ and I feel like ???huh???

I don’t know if I have a stupid crush? or what. I’m not used to thinking about my body as anything other than something that I need to learn to control better. I don’t talk about it in a good way.

I have no idea if he (the friend) is flirting with me either but my husband definitely feels uncomfortable about it. He pointed out the friend will often text him (my husband) asking when I’m going to get to the gym if my husband is skipping that day. I had put on around 5kg over Nov/Dec which I lost fast this month since this exercise is more than what I did before (only cardio). The friend said ‘wow it really shows up, your body looks nice’ but this was in front of my husband not a separate thing. Friend apparently went out of his way to get a specific pastry I like for my birthday - I didn’t know that. And well, my husband is the one who told him about the pastry, I literally do not talk to this friend unless my husband is in the same room.

I didn’t think much of any of this till my husband talked to me a few days ago about how me saying thank you to the friend when he says something during the set is flirting and that’s problematic because the friend’s marriage is on the rocks. I swear I’m not trying to flirt. But I goddamn don’t remember how to flirt anymore anyways. I’ve been being VERY upfront with my husband when I talk to him suggestively, it’s not subtle at all.

Friend’s compliments have been lingering a bit in my mind and I had a dream about him last night. Not an inappropriate dream. But it definitely felt…off. We were having coffee in the cafe where that pastry is from. And talking about how we both lost our mom’s to a sudden disease in the same year and how we have similar responsibilities in our families as the elder siblings etc. We have spoken about these things before but in the gym while waiting for our turns on a machine, not in a cafe and definitely not when it’s just the two of us.

Does having this sort of dream mean I have a crush? or something more serious? Coupled with how repulsed my husband seems to the idea of having sex with me, if I am going to start having dis-loyal thoughts - I don’t see a reason to stay in the marriage.

How do I even start unpacking the stupidity in my head? Does anyone have any tips? Or is it not even stupidity but something insidious like a sort of perversion?!

Also, we don’t have kids. I mean, no sex means no way of having them anyways lol. I lurk here a lot and I always see that as a key decision point when people talk about leaving their marriage.",5,1769795335.0,DeadBedrooms,14,1.0,False

I'd stop obsessing over my bank account, stop doing mental math every time I bought coffee, stop feeling that weird knot in my stomach about money. Yeah, that's not what happened.

Look, more money definitely helped with the obvious stuff. I stopped panicking about bills. Groceries became normal instead of stressful. But that background hum of worry? It didn't go away. It just morphed into something else. Now instead of ""do I have enough,"" it was ""am I doing this right?"" Am I saving enough? Investing smart? Why does my account seem lower than it should be when I didn't even buy anything major?

Here's the weird part: I started checking my accounts more after I started earning more. Not because anything was wrong, just because I needed... I don't know, proof? Reassurance? And the reassurance would last maybe a day before I needed another hit.

It took me way too long to realize the actual problem wasn't the dollar amount. It was all the uncertainty. Money coming in and going out at random times. Subscriptions I forgot existed suddenly charging me. Bills that weren't even that expensive but always seemed to show up at the worst moment. My brain was basically running a spreadsheet 24/7 in the background, and it was exhausting.

The thing that really got me is that the calm I was looking for never came from optimizing harder or making more. It came from just knowing what to expect. From not having to keep a running tally in my head at all times.

I'm still working on this, but I think maybe the whole ""financial peace"" thing has less to do with your income and more to do with how much noise money makes in your daily life. And turns out, making more doesn't automatically quiet things down.",10,1769795240.0,Life,10,1.0,False

1qrc9rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1qrc9rh/men_who_are_one_of_the_chosen_ones_that_have/,"Men who are one of the ""chosen ones"" that have women that actually show interest when you ""just go about your day"" - how does it change your dating strategy? how does it feel?","We all know that only a small % of men are the ""chosen"" ones who can just ""go about their lives / day"" have female interest, Whether it be - noticing women check you out / smile at you at the gym/coffee shop/out at bars etc. or finding out that women have crushes on you / DM you on instagram etc.

I (like the vast majority of men) are not one of the ""chosen ones"". here is what my typically week looks like:

\- I don't get looks when I'm out in public and am basically invisible - whether it be the gym, coffee shop, out at bars/restaurants etc. For example - I don't think I've ever noticed a women checking me out at the gym, and I've been going to the gym for 10+ years about 3 times a week. I've been maybe hit on 2-3 times when out at a bar in my whole life

\- One other thing that happens is that I get a lot of 'proactive avoidance"" from women - women that may be single or around my age are just never ""around me"".  like if I'm at at coffee shop at a table a women will sit down, but on the opposite end of the table. or at bars women will come in, look at the open spots  next to me, and choose to sit somewhere else - or will turn their bodies away from me if they have to sit next to me. This basically makes it impossible to actually chat with women since they don't put themselves in close proximity to me. I think this is actually subconcoius as they don't want to be in a situation where I may chat with them.

BUT, I've seen men that are ""chosen"" - and it's different. I see it on reddit all the time where men say they notice women smiling at them at the gym, checking them out in public,etc. or I hear women state they keep looking at certain men / and notice them looking back.

What is this like for you men who are ""Chosen"" and get to experience this? do you just ""sit back and relax and let things happen?"" do you even use dating apps? do most of your relationships start ""naturally"" just be chatting with women in your environment that happen to approach you or strike a convo with you?

\[Also, I do fine for myself- I just have to make the first move ;), personality really helps with the right woman!. I'm honestly genuinely curious as I feel like these men experience things completely different from me. It's like wondering what it feels to be rich when you are poor etc\]",1,1769794836.0,AskMenAdvice,138,0.51,False

I kept doing it but started noticing the wait time ends up being very random whenever this happens, and often on a pretty long side (like 3+ minutes), like they forget you are out there, once they gave me a totally cold latte as well after making me wait 5+ minutes. So the last two times they tried this **when there was no other cars waiting behind me at all.** I just refused. They get visibly annoyed of course but I got my stuff within 30 seconds of saying no and just waiting at the window.

Now I understand working at TH likely sucks and they are under pressure to maintain some kind of drive through timer from the management. Am I screwing the employees over financially by doing this? Am I just an entitled asshole, who thinks people shouldn't have to park their cars and wait extra time when they are the only car in the drive through and already waiting anyway? 

Making customers wait longer so the store can claim efficiency that isn't there also seems like total BS to me. Does the management encourage the employees to do this, or is this something they do on their own accord to manipulate wait times?",0,1769794789.0,TimHortons,42,0.35,False

hoping to get some feedback on how to best invest for retirement. i am 28, currently making 84k with a yearly raise expected for the next few years. i’m getting close to the top of my pay scale for my current position, so unless i decide to get into a management level position (unlikely) i would say i’m getting close to my highest earning years unless i decide to move on to a different employer.

i have three registered accounts (TFSA, FHSA, and RRSP) and also enrolled in an employer-matched DB pension plan. none of my registered accounts are maxed out.

i opened the RRSP prior to my current job. i have been making marginal contributions to this since i enrolled into my pension.

i opened the FHSA approx. 1.5yrs ago, nearly maximizing the yearly 8k contribution amount however after some careful consideration i am no longer interested in homeownership, and would prefer to rent the rest of my life. i would like to use the extra money i could save as ‘fun money’ (trips, hobbies, $8 coffees, you name it).

with my change of heart re: home ownership, i was wondering whether it’s best to now prioritize my TFSA over my FHSA? or, since the 15yr clock is already ticking on the FHSA, should i continue to max this out? either choice i would roll the FHSA amount into the RRSP after the 15yr period. perhaps it would be best to begin maximizing growth of the FHSA now (i would invest into a long-term ETF, and since it’ll be rolled into the RRSP regardless) which i could then use for a more comfortable income to bridge the gap between an early retirement and when the DB pension kicks in? i think that’s how it can work at least.

hoping to get some insight on how to best approach saving for retirement, while living the best i can now.

I’ll be working from home full-time and living in German Village with my boyfriend, who does have a car. I personally don’t have one yet and was planning to hold off on buying one until sometime this summer.

I’m coming from NYC, so I’m used to walking/transit/Ubers for everything, but I know Columbus is a very different setup. My main needs would be groceries, errands, gym, and coffee shops. I don’t expect to commute daily, but I don’t want to feel totally stranded either.

For people who live in or around German Village:

* Is it realistic to be car-free there short-term?
* How walkable/bikeable is the area day-to-day?
* Is Uber/Lyft reliable enough if needed?

I know long-term a car is probably necessary, but I’m curious how doable this is for the first few months. Appreciate any insight,  Thanks!",3,1769794194.0,Columbus,19,0.64,False

1qrby1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qrby1g/3_texting_secrets_that_make_men_obsessed/,3 Texting Secrets That Make Men Obsessed (Psychology-Backed),"Okay so I spent way too much time analyzing Matthew Hussey's texting advice and cross-referencing it with actual behavioral psychology research. And honestly? The rabbit hole was worth it.

Here's what nobody tells you: Most dating advice around texting is complete garbage. It's either ""be mysterious"" or ""just be yourself"" which are both useless. The real game isn't about playing hard to get or being available 24/7. It's about understanding how male psychology actually works when it comes to digital communication.

I've pulled insights from Hussey's work, plus relationship research from Dr. John Gottman, Helen Fisher's studies on attraction, and some evolutionary psychology that'll make you rethink everything. Let's get into the actual techniques that create genuine interest.

## The Curiosity Gap Technique

Men are biologically wired to pursue what feels slightly out of reach. Not because they're shallow, but because the dopamine reward system in their brain literally lights up when there's uncertainty combined with hope.

Here's the framework: End your texts with something that invites continuation but doesn't demand it. Instead of ""What are you up to tonight?"" try ""Just saw something that reminded me of that conversation we had..."" and leave it there. You're creating what behavioral economists call the Zeigarnik Effect, where unfinished interactions stick in our minds way more than completed ones.

**The book that explains this perfectly:** *""The Art of Seduction""* by Robert Greene. Yes it sounds manipulative but hear me out. Greene won the National Bestsellers Award for this, and he breaks down historical patterns of influence that are rooted in psychology, not games. The section on creating emotional valleys and peaks is insanely good. After reading it I understood why some texts get responses in 30 seconds while others get left on read. This completely shifted how I think about all communication, not just dating.

The key is tension and release. Not playing games, but understanding that human attention is drawn to what feels dynamic rather than static.

## The High Value Signal

This one's controversial but it's backed by evolutionary psychology: Men are attracted to women who have full lives. Not because they're intimidated, but because it signals genetic fitness and social proof.

Your texting should reflect this reality. When he texts, you don't need to respond instantly even if you saw it. Take 20 minutes, an hour, whatever feels natural for someone who's genuinely engaged in their life. The research from Dr. Helen Fisher's work on attraction shows that intermittent reinforcement (unpredictable response times) actually increases romantic interest more than consistent immediate responses.

But here's the nuance everyone misses: This only works if you're ACTUALLY living a full life. You can't fake it. If you're sitting around waiting to text back, he'll sense the inauthenticity eventually.

**Resource that changed my perspective:** The **""Modern Wisdom""** podcast episode with Matthew Hussey. He breaks down the difference between artificial scarcity (playing games) and authentic value (actually being busy with meaningful stuff). The distinction is everything. He talks about how the goal isn't to seem unavailable but to genuinely BE someone with options, interests, and a life that's compelling with or without a man in it.

Also check out the app **""Paired""**. It's designed for couples but has incredible research-backed communication exercises that teach you how to create emotional depth through text and conversation. The daily question prompts are gold for understanding what actually builds connection vs surface level chatter.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on the psychology side without getting stuck in theoretical fluff, there's **BeFreed**, a personalized learning app that connects you to expert insights from relationship books, dating psychology research, and real-world case studies. Just type in something like ""how to be magnetic in dating as someone who overthinks"" and it generates audio lessons tailored specifically to your situation. 

You can customize how deep you want to go, from quick 15-minute breakdowns to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples and context. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, confident tone that makes listening feel less like work and more like getting advice from that brutally honest friend who actually knows what she's talking about. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content pulls from legitimate sources rather than random internet opinions.

## The Emotional Amplification Strategy

Most people text in neutral. They relay information. ""How was your day?"" ""Good, yours?"" This creates zero emotional momentum.

Men respond to texts that make them FEEL something. Playful teasing. Genuine excitement. Even light challenge. The neuroscience here is clear: emotional arousal (positive or negative) creates stronger neural pathways and memory formation than neutral interactions.

Try this: Instead of ""That's funny"" respond with ""Okay that actually made me laugh out loud in the middle of the coffee shop and now people are staring."" Specificity plus emotion equals engagement.

Or use callback humor. Reference something from a previous conversation and add a playful twist. This does two things: shows you were actually listening, and creates an inside joke dynamic which is intimacy building.

**The resource everyone sleeps on:** *""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion""* by Robert Cialdini. This won the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award and it's not about manipulation, it's about understanding why humans respond to certain communication patterns. The chapter on liking and rapport is directly applicable to texting dynamics. Cialdini explains how similarity and genuine compliments activate the reciprocity principle in ways that create natural attraction.

**YouTube channel worth binging:** Matthew Hussey's actual channel ""Matthew Hussey"" obviously, but specifically his texting breakdown videos. He analyzes real text exchanges and explains the psychology behind what works and what kills attraction. Way more practical than generic advice.

## The Reality Check

Look, none of this matters if the guy isn't actually interested or emotionally available. These techniques amplify existing interest, they don't create it from nothing. And honestly? If you're twisting yourself into knots over texts, that's usually a sign the dynamic isn't right anyway.

The healthiest approach is using these insights to communicate more effectively while staying grounded in your own worth. You're not trying to trick someone into liking you. You're understanding human psychology to express interest in ways that actually land, rather than ways that accidentally repel.

The goal isn't to become a texting strategist. It's to understand enough about how attraction works that you can text authentically while working WITH male psychology instead of against it. Less anxiety, more clarity, better results.",1,1769794166.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False
1qrbxsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/JWORX_531/comments/1qrbxsa/response_to_writing_prompt_prompt_the_last_man_on/,Response to Writing Prompt --> PROMPT: The last man on Earth is Joe Rogan.,"You ever see a hairless chimp? Those things are jacked, man–almost as jacked as the existential dread that follows a nuclear apocalypse. Joe Rogan lit another makeshift cigar and stared across the expanse of his bunker studio. He had eaten all the elk meat. He had microdosed all the ayahuasca. Now, like the last lingering scoop of creatine, he was truly alone.

He breathed deep of the dark and spoke. “You see some of those bodies, topside? Nothing but lean muscle.”

Silence.

“It’s gotta be keto or something,” he added.

His generator sputtered. After several seconds, it gave up the ghost.

A boundless dark stared back at him, as profound and silent as the ocean’s floor. Fortunately, he’d been doing his Tibetan eyeball exercises. Soon he was able to distinguish the outline of his life-sized sasquatch-holding-a-rocket-launcher cutout.

The show must go on.

Joe Rogan took another sip of his bulletproof coffee but remembered that instead of coffee he’d been simply re-experiencing the fading memory of coffee, his cup as hollow and cold as the bunker’s airtight antechamber. Still, he abided by his usual philosophy: that if he just said enough *things,* everything would work itself out. “I heard that causes autism,” he said, though it wasn’t clear to what he was referring. “Jamie pull that shit up.”

The imperative to *pull that shit up* was both a reference to his producer’s old role in pulling up content on the computer and to his newer, more laborious role in dredging the open-air septic tank they had been using since the blast.

Jamie, however, was a skeleton now.

“Yeah, man,” the MMA and stand-up comedy enthusiast continued, “I’ve been taking B12 for months.”

Silence.

“I’m not saying I *agree* with him! I’m just saying he deserves to be platformed!”

Joe Rogan—or “Baby Blue,” as the other marauders had called him in those first weeks after the blast—remembered his early days, when he was just starting out as a Fear Factor host. *Master your breathing and you master your mind.* “Man, it’s like you can’t say *anything* anymore,” he said, a vague reference to “cancel culture” and the fact that his producer was a skeleton now and thus incapable of saying anything anymore.

As if on cue, a voice floated from the dark. *“Joe Rogan…”* it said.

Joe Rogan jumped. “Wh-who is it?”

*“It is I… Joe Rogan…”*

Joe Rogan, in accordance with his Tibetan eyeball exercises, squinted and brought out from the dark the shape of Joe Rogan, hunched and bald in the seat opposite him.

“Joe Rogan!” Joe Rogan cried. “What are you doing here?”

“Why, I’m your next guest,” Joe Rogan replied.

Joe Rogan gasped. This was just like his first ten times in the freshwater isolation tank. “But *I’m* Joe Rogan!” he cried. “Me!”

Joe Rogan squinted more intently, just to make sure this wasn’t Bill Burr or some other such interloper, but those traps and delts were unmistakable.

“I’m Joe Rogan Alpha,” the grim spectre intoned.

“No, *I’m* Alpha,” Joe Rogan replied. “You can be Joe Rogan Beta.”

The grim spectre lit a scrap of driftwood and brought it to his lips. “Ever see a hairless chimp?”

Joe Rogan gasped mightily. “Jamie,” he cried, “pull that shit up.”

Perhaps the term “last man on Earth” was a misnomer, as his podcast bunker was not *on* Earth but in fact a mile below its crust. In more sober moments, Joe Rogan wondered if *man* was not similarly inaccurate. Was he still a man? Or had he become something lesser, a creature hunched and shivering at the altar of some forgotten god?

Meanwhile, on the surface, the last women on Earth had rebuilt society in their image, a utopia of sisterhood and clean electric power.

1qrbsvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1qrbsvi/why_butter_cookies_are_the_ultimate_teatime/,Why Butter Cookies Are the Ultimate Tea-Time Companion,"Tea time is more than a pause in the day. It’s a ritual, a moment of calm, and a chance to connect — whether with colleagues, friends, or simply yourself. And when it comes to tea-time accompaniments, few treats match the gentle allure of butter cookies. But why have butter cookies earned this special place beside the steaming cup? In this comprehensive blog, we’ll explore the history, sensory harmony, cultural relevance, versatility, and timeless charm that make butter cookies the ultimate tea-time companion.

# The Timeless Culture of Tea Time

Tea time has a long and rich history across the world. From the formal afternoon tea of Britain to casual chai breaks in South Asia, tea is often paired with light bites.

**Tea Time Origins and Traditions**

The concept of afternoon tea was popularized in England in the 19th century, traditionally involving tea served with bread, sandwiches, and sweet treats. This custom soon spread across the globe, adapting to local tea styles and snacks. Butter cookies became a frequent accompaniment because they balance the simplicity of tea without overwhelming the palate.

Tea rituals often center on relaxation, reflection, and social connection — and the right snack can elevate that experience.

# Butter Cookies: A Simple Delight

To understand their enduring appeal with tea, it helps to break down what butter cookies are.

**What Defines a Butter Cookie?**

[Butter cookies](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden) are classic cookies made primarily of:

* Butter
* Sugar
* Flour
* Sometimes vanilla or other mild flavorings

With minimal ingredients, the magic lies in technique: creaming butter and sugar creates a tender, melt-in-the-mouth texture that harmonizes beautifully with tea.

# Flavor Harmony: Why Butter and Tea Work Perfectly

One of the main reasons butter cookies pair so well with tea is how their flavors interact.

**Contrast and Complement**

Butter cookies have a rich, creamy flavor with a subtle sweetness — not too sugary, not too complex. This makes them a lovely foil to many tea types:

* **Black tea:** The robust, tannic notes of black tea are softened by the rich sweetness of butter cookies.
* **Green tea:** Light and vegetal green teas pair well with the buttery richness, balancing crisp notes with soft texture.
* **Herbal teas:** Gentle flavors like chamomile or mint are enhanced by the buttery warmth of the cookie.

The gentle, comforting flavor of butter cookies helps accentuate the experience of sipping tea rather than overshadowing it.

**Texture Matters**

The crumbly but slightly crisp texture of butter cookies contrasts nicely with tea’s smooth liquid feel. Each bite feels satisfying without heaviness, making butter cookies ideal for multiple rounds of tea sips.

# A Snack That Fits Every Occasion

Butter cookies aren’t just for formal afternoon tea. Their simplicity and familiarity make them perfect across informal and festive moments.

**Everyday Tea Breaks**

Whether it’s a quick break at work or a mid-morning tea at home, butter cookies are convenient, easy to portion, and not messy — perfect for grabbing between sips.

**Special Occasions and Gatherings**

At gatherings or family functions, butter cookies feel like a universal crowd pleaser because they’re familiar to most palates and pair well with a wide range of teas.

**Pairings Beyond Tea**

Butter cookies also complement coffee, hot chocolate, and even dessert wines — but it’s their synergy with tea that remains timeless.

# Butter Cookies and Comfort

There’s a strong emotional component to tea and butter cookies.

**Nostalgia and Emotional Warmth**

Many of us associate tea time with comfort and connection — grandma’s kitchen, afternoon breaks, or cozy chats with friends. Butter cookies often carry nostalgic memories, reinforcing why they fit so naturally with tea rituals.

This emotional flavor — comfort — often outweighs newer, trendier snacks. Some people even search for vintage cookie tins on marketplaces or collectible platforms like sites like eBay and TrueGether to recapture that classic tea-time charm.

# Butter Cookies in Global Tea Cultures

Across the world, tea and simple cookies or biscuits go hand in hand.

**Europe**

In Europe, biscuits and tea have a long shared history. Butter cookies are especially popular in northern countries, where rich dairy products like butter play a significant role in traditional baking.

**Asia**

In South Asia, tea is often paired with light sweets or biscuits. Butter cookies are a frequent choice because their subtle sweetness complements spiced teas like masala chai.

**The Americas**

In the U.S. and Canada, butter cookies appear alongside afternoon teas and coffee breaks alike, often in holiday tins or homemade batches.

These cultural overlaps show that butter cookies aren’t limited to one tea tradition — instead, they enhance tea cultures across regions.

# The Art and Craft of Making Butter Cookies

While butter cookies are simple at heart, mastering them is an art.

**Key Techniques That Matter**

* **Creaming butter and sugar:** This step incorporates air into the batter, giving cookies a tender texture.
* **Proper temperature:** Butter should be softened — not melted — to achieve the right consistency.
* **Ingredient quality:** Good butter and fresh flour make a noticeable difference in both flavor and texture.

These techniques help bake cookies that don’t just taste good, but feel luxurious with every bite.

# Seasonal and Festive Variations

Butter cookies are easily adapted for seasonal tea times.

**Holiday Twists**

During holidays, bakers often add:

* Spices like cinnamon or nutmeg
* Citrus zests
* Festive shapes like stars or snowflakes

These variations make butter cookies versatile for festive teas, parties, or cookie exchanges.

**Flavored Butter Cookies**

While classic butter cookies are beloved for simplicity, contemporary bakers sometimes experiment with:

* Almond or coconut butter
* Lemon or orange infusions
* Light chocolate drizzles

This continuous evolution keeps butter cookies relevant even as taste trends shift.

# Butter Cookies and Mindful Eating

In a world of sweet snacks overloaded with sugar and artificial ingredients, butter cookies stand out for a simpler ingredient list.

**Less Sugar, More Satisfaction**

Because butter cookies depend on fat and technique for flavor, they often use less sugar than more elaborate desserts. This makes them easier to enjoy in moderation during a tea break without feeling overwhelmed by sweetness.

**A Treat Without Guilt**

When enjoyed mindfully with tea, butter cookies can be part of a balanced snack routine — something to be savored, not rushed.

# Butter Cookies and Today’s Digital World

The way people discover recipes and snacks has expanded thanks to digital media.

**Community Sharing and Baking Trends**

Social platforms, food blogs, and video channels are full of butter cookie recipes, decorating ideas, and tea-pairing suggestions. This keeps classic recipes in circulation while introducing new generations to them.

**Online Marketplaces and Specialty Batches**

Beyond homemade baking, many artisans sell butter cookies online, expanding access beyond local bakeries. Whether through direct shops or online marketplaces, people can discover unique or traditional cookie variants with ease.

Occasionally, collectible tins or limited-edition batches become sought-after items on resale platforms, where enthusiasts trade them in collector communities found on [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether.

# Making Your Own Butter Cookies at Home

Baking butter cookies at home is both accessible and rewarding.

**A Simple Classic Recipe**

A basic butter cookie recipe typically includes:

* 1 cup of softened butter
* ¾ cup of sugar
* 2 cups of flour
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
* A pinch of salt

Mix, shape, chill, and bake — and the aroma alone often feels worth the effort.

**Tips for Beginners**

* Chill the dough before baking for better shape.
* Use a hand mixer to cream butter and sugar efficiently.
* Avoid overmixing once flour is added to keep cookies tender.

These tips help ensure successful results, even for first-time bakers.

# Butter Cookies as Gifts and Entertaining

Butter cookies are also favorites for gifting.

**Beautiful Packaging and Presentation**

Whether in homemade jars, decorative tins, or gift boxes, butter cookies make thoughtful tokens for friends and loved ones.

**Shared Experiences**

Cookies shared over tea extend beyond flavor. They create moments — whether at a book club, kitchen table, or holiday gathering.

# Conclusion: A Classic Companion That Never Fades

Butter cookies are more than a snack — they represent timeless comfort, simple luxury, and the joy of shared moments. Their subtle sweetness and tender texture make them a perfect match for tea, complementing the ritual and elevating the experience.

From traditional customs to modern bakeries and online communities, butter cookies continue to connect people across cultures and generations. Whether you’re baking them at home, discovering artisan batches, or pairing them with your favorite tea blend, butter cookies remain a beloved and enduring tea-time companion.

As long as people seek connection, comfort, and a bit of sweetness in life, butter cookies will continue to stand strong beside every cup of tea.

## Worst Scores

These are all the places that scored worse than 85, which are relatively unusual. Scores between 85 and 99 aren't included here since these are typically just minor misses in an inspection and likely not worth worrying about. A list of three previous scores are included for each establish to help provide some context on recent scores.

Links below: `Score` → inspection, `Name` → inspection history, `Location` → Google map.

It is a summary sourced from the latest data available on the amazing [Deschutes County Inspection Website](https://inspections.myhealthdepartment.com/or-deschutes-county). If you're interested in inspections and how local places have performed in the past, it's a great resource and worth checking out!

1qrbpu6,https://i.redd.it/kanq8xjatigg1.jpeg,Rest this Shabbat,"This week I was working from a coffee shop and I heard two women at the table next to me talking.

One said she didn't get to work on her project yesterday because she watched Netflix instead. The other one immediately jumped in: 

""You deserve it! That's self-care. And you work so hard, you've earned it!""

And I disagreed. Twice, actually.

Let me explain.

First, you deserve self-care and downtime regardless of anything. You do NOT need to earn it. 

It's not that the harder you work, the more you deserve self-care and downtime.

And if this seems trivial (or really not), let me explain why I feel it's so important. 

If our brain accepts the following formula: 

Hard Work = Deserve To Rest

It also accepts the flip side of the same formula: 

Not Enough Hard Work = Do Not Deserve To Rest

And you can replace ""to rest"" with ""to enjoy,"" ""to relax,"" ""to be calm""...

You deserve rest because you're human. Not because you earned it.

But that wasn't my main disagreement with what I couldn't help but overhear. This was:

In order to become who you want to be and get to where you want to be - at least in my personal experience - self-care and discipline must be two completely different departments.

One does not switch shifts with the other.

It may sound harsh, but I can tell you for certain: 

Without discipline over time, I would not have the life that I have.

You would not be reading these words. 

I would not have discovered what I'm capable of or what truly matters to me.

I would not have the home that I built, a successful business, or my relationship with my husband.

Because every single step that really changed who I am and my life for the better came with a great deal of discomfort. And that took discipline over time, staying in the game despite the hardship.

Moving countries.

Taking a leap of faith on who is now my husband because we met across the ocean (and got together despite all odds).

Creating a new way to learn Hebrew from scratch - a business whose success depends entirely on what I do (or don't do) every single day, year after year.

Going out to meet new people in the hopes of making new friends in my late 40s because all my friends are so many miles away. 

None of these things are comfortable.

None of them are certain.

None of them are easy or fast.

But here’s the important distinction:

They never feel wrong. They feel right. Just not comfortable. Not known. Not certain.

Discipline feels hard. But right. 

Avoiding discipline feels comfortable but many times wrong (because it is).

Self-care is important. Rest is essential. Downtime matters. Always.

That is not the wrong thing about it.

It's wrong when it replaces your discipline time. 

Because when you're working toward something - when you're building toward the person you want to become and the life you want to have - 

Trading discipline time for comfortable time and calling it self-care can cost you the growth you want.

So next time you're about to trade the time you should be working toward your goal - for scrolling, for screen time, for another Netflix episode - ask yourself:

When March comes. When June comes. When the holidays are here again - what will you be thinking about?

The show you watched? The hours you scrolled?

Or the growth you brought into your world, your life, yourself?

This applies to everything. 

Growth requires discipline over time. Showing up when it's hard. When you'd rather relax. Pushing through the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing, of making mistakes, of staying with confusion until clarity arrives.

That's not comfortable. But that's what works.

Self-care has its place. Discipline has its place. Know which time is which - that's what I wanted to tell the women at the next table. And I'm telling you instead.

Shabbat reminds us that rest is sacred. It has its place. But so does the work. The discipline. The uncomfortable growth that changes everything.

You deserve rest. Period. And you also deserve the life you're working toward.

Don't trade one for the other.

Shabbat Shalom 💙

1qrbosn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qrbosn/ice_ice_baby/,Ice Ice Baby,"Timothy

The morning started like any other—black coffee, no sugar, no cream. Just like the job. Bitter. Straight. Necessary. Timothy laced up his boots slow, methodical, like he was still in the army he never got into. He’d tried. Twice. Flat feet, they said. Then the police academy. “Too soft,” they said. But ICE? ICE took him. Gave him a badge, a vest, and a mission: uphold the law.

He told himself he was doing good. Protecting borders. Keeping order. But some nights, when the mask came off and the mirror stared back, he saw his mother’s eyes. His abuela’s hands. And he wondered if the law ever looked like them.

Today was a takedown. Big one. “High-priority undocumented,” the file said. Timothy didn’t ask questions. He never did. Until he saw the address.

Marshall

Marshall woke up grinning. He always did on raid days. He liked the sound of boots on tile, the way doors cracked under pressure, the look in their eyes when they realized the game was up. He called it “justice.” But really, it was sport.

He was already in uniform before the sun rose, humming “Ice Ice Baby” under his breath like it was a war anthem. He holstered his sidearm like a cowboy and slapped the side of the van when he saw Timothy.

“Ready to bag another one, Timo?” he smirked.

Timothy didn’t answer. Just nodded. But his jaw was tight. Marshall noticed. Didn’t care.

Timothy

The van rolled through the old neighborhood like a ghost. Timothy hadn’t been back in years. Not since he got the badge. Not since he stopped being “Mijo” and started being “traitor.”

He saw the murals still up—Virgen de Guadalupe, Cesar Chavez, Big Pun. He saw the corner store where he used to buy tamarindo and sunflower seeds. And he saw the house.

His abuela’s house. He froze.

“Yo,” Marshall barked. “You good?”

Timothy didn’t answer. He stared at the screen. The photo. The target.

Maria Delgado. Age 72. No papers. No priors. No threat.

His abuela.

Marshall

Marshall was already halfway out the van, vest strapped, boots crunching gravel. He loved this part. The adrenaline. The power. He didn’t care who was behind the door. Brown was brown. Illegal was illegal. He didn’t make the rules…he just enforced them. With pleasure.

Timothy grabbed his arm.

“Wait.”

Marshall turned, annoyed. “What?”

“I know her.”

Marshall raised an eyebrow. “So?”

“She’s my grandmother.”

Marshall blinked. Then laughed. “You serious?”

Timothy didn’t flinch.

Marshall’s face hardened. “Then she should’ve done her paperwork.”

Timothy

The words hit like a slap. “She should’ve done her paperwork.” Like she was a bill. A receipt. A mistake.

Timothy’s hands shook. Not from fear. From rage. From shame. From the weight of the badge on his chest and the blood in his veins.

He looked at the house. The curtains moved. They saw him. They knew. Even with the mask. They knew.

“Mijo?” a voice called faintly from the porch. “¿Eres tú?”

He turned away.

Marshall

Marshall didn’t wait. He signaled the team. “On my go.”

He loved this part. The countdown. The breach. The chaos.

“Three…”

Timothy

He stood frozen. Torn between duty and blood. Between the law and love. Between the man he wanted to be and the man he’d become.

“Two…”

He looked at Marshall. At the team. At the door.

“One…”

The battering ram rose.

The door trembled.

And in that breathless second before impact, everything paused.

Was it justice?

Was it betrayal?

Was it too late?

1qrbo0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Essays/comments/1qrbo0q/on_being_honey/,On being honey,"This morning, as I sip my coffee and stare out the window, I look to the sunlight that catches on the hanging crystals. I think about my dream, about the cyclical nature of systems, of life, and death of love and light. I think about how tempting emotional sugar was — wanting to belong, just for a moment. But I’ve never been sugar. I’ve always been honey, amber colored, slow.

It was never David and Goliath: it was systems, structures. What happens, I wonder, when a system no longer serves itself?

I want love, everybody does, but Lore’s myth was never mine to metabolize,  “nothing will suffice but the taste of you.” That’s not how I inhabit love. The closest, for me, is choice: showing up, staying when it gets ugly.

The lights of the aurora borealis in the sky. A gentle reminder that you don’t have to be the moon to light up the sky.

I think about the decay of autumn into winter, of animals going into hibernation, and day after day, I turn to England. I am no longer bound to the childish belief of folklore, myth, and magic of being soul tied. I am drawn to these places because they can hold time, proof that life continues, as the modern world rises against the architecture of the past, blending the now.

I am here, present, in my breath, in the soft grace of morning birdsong, in the powerful crashing of sea waves. In the beauty of Venetian pearls as they survive centuries.

If I love, I will love on Tuesdays, with an open door, laundry hanging fresh on the line. I will be honey.

You can’t truly replicate something you don’t already inhabit. That’s sovereignty.

1qrbisu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1qrbisu/why_butter_cookies_never_go_out_of_style/,Why Butter Cookies Never Go Out of Style,"Butter cookies are one of the most beloved treats around the world — simple, rich, and impossibly comforting. Whether served at holiday gatherings, paired with tea, or given as thoughtful gifts, these cookies seem to transcend generations, cultures, and trends. But what is it about butter cookies that keeps them so enduringly popular, even as countless new dessert trends come and go?

In this blog, we’ll explore why butter cookies never go out of style. We’ll look at their history, sensory appeal, cultural significance, versatility, and even how modern buyers discover and share them — from traditional bakeries to online communities and marketplaces like sites like eBay and TrueGether.

# What Makes Butter Cookies Special?

At first glance, butter cookies might look simple: flour, sugar, and plenty of butter. Yet this simplicity is exactly what gives them their magic. Their texture, flavor, and familiarity contribute to a universal appeal that few other sweets can match.

# The Irresistible Combination of Butter and Sugar

Butter cookies owe their name — and much of their appeal — to butter. Butter is more than just an ingredient; it’s the heart of the cookie’s flavor profile. When creamed with sugar, butter helps create:

* **A rich, creamy taste** that feels indulgent without being overpowering.
* **A tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture**, because fat coats flour proteins and inhibits excessive gluten development.
* **A satisfying aroma** as butter browns slightly during baking, releasing fragrant compounds that trigger cravings and comfort.

Even people who are not regular dessert eaters often find themselves reaching for butter cookies precisely because they offer the “pure cookie” experience: no crazy add-ins, just buttery goodness.

# Texture That Transcends Trends

[Butter cookies](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden) strike a perfect balance between delicate crumb and satisfying bite. Unlike cakier cookies that can feel too soft, or dense cookies that feel heavy, butter cookies have:

* A tender yet slightly crisp edge
* A soft, fine crumb in the center
* A satisfying feel that complements teas, coffees, and desserts alike

This texture appeals to a wide range of tastes and ages, which helps explain why they continue to be a favorite across generations.

# The Storied History of Butter Cookies

To understand why butter cookies remain timeless, it helps to look at their roots.

**Origins in European Baking Tradition**

Butter cookies trace their origins to European baking — especially Denmark and Britain — where butter was abundant and cookie-making a cherished craft. In these regions, butter cookies evolved from simple rural recipes into refined treats served at special occasions and holidays.

In Denmark, for example, butter cookies were traditionally baked for Christmas and shared among neighbors and family. These traditions ingrained them deeply in cultural memory, turning a simple sweet into a symbol of warmth and celebration.

**Adaptation Across Cultures**

As Europeans migrated and global trade expanded, butter cookie recipes traveled too. Each culture adapted the basic formula to local tastes and ingredients. In some places, spices like cardamom or cinnamon were added; in others, local dairy fats lent unique flavors.

This adaptability helped butter cookies become not just a European favorite, but a global one — enjoyed in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and beyond.

# Butter Cookies and Emotional Connection

Food is more than flavor and texture; it’s also memory and emotion. Butter cookies carry emotional resonance that many modern desserts don’t.

**Nostalgia and Tradition**

For many people, butter cookies evoke childhood memories: baking with grandparents, holiday celebrations, or tea time with family. This nostalgia creates a deep emotional attachment that keeps the cookie relevant year after year.

Unlike flashier sweets that might be popular for a season, butter cookies are comfort food in the purest sense.

**Symbol of Hospitality and Gift-Giving**

Butter cookies are also commonly associated with hospitality. Beautiful tins of assorted butter cookies are popular gifts during holidays, housewarmings, and special events.

This tradition reinforces their timeless appeal: gifting cookies is not just about the treat itself, but the warmth and goodwill they represent.

# Versatility in Flavor and Presentation

One reason butter cookies stay relevant is their versatility. From simple rounds to ornate shapes, the recipe can be customized in endless ways.

**Simple to Ornate**

Butter cookie dough is wonderfully adaptable. Bakers can keep it simple with classic rounds dusted with sugar or elevate it with:

* Shape cutters (stars, hearts, animals)
* Dipped or drizzled chocolate
* Citrus zest (lemon, orange)
* Vanilla bean or other extracts
* Sprinkles or sanding sugar for festive decoration

This flexibility makes butter cookies suitable for everyday treats and special-occasion desserts alike.

**Pairing With Beverages and Desserts**

Butter cookies also pair beautifully with drinks and desserts. Their mild sweetness and rich mouthfeel complement:

* Tea and coffee
* Ice cream and sorbets
* Warm puddings and fruit compotes

The cookie’s neutral yet rich profile makes it a versatile companion to many culinary experiences.

# The Role of Butter Cookies in Modern Baking Culture

Even as food trends shift — think cronuts, artisanal doughnuts, and fusion desserts — butter cookies remain a reliable favorite, both for home bakers and professional artisans.

**Home Baking: Familiar and Achievable**

Many home bakers start with butter cookies because they are forgiving and require minimal equipment. The basic dough teaches foundational baking techniques like creaming, measuring, and temperature control.

Because the ingredient list is short and predictable, even novice bakers can produce excellent results quickly. This accessibility helps maintain butter cookies’ popularity in the age of social baking and online recipe sharing.

**Artisan and Boutique Bakeries**

In professional baking spaces, butter cookies continue to be reinvented and elevated. Bakeries craft gourmet versions with premium European butter, house-made jams, or delicate icing designs. Some bakers even experiment with unusual flours or flavor infusions, proving the cookie’s adaptability to modern tastes.

# Butter Cookies in the Digital Marketplace Era

The way people discover and buy food products online has also contributed to the cookie’s enduring popularity.

**Online Marketplaces Make Discovery Easier**

Beyond traditional bakery shops, online marketplaces allow small bakers and brands to reach customers worldwide. Buyers can find signature butter cookies from independent artisans without leaving their homes.

Some sellers list specialty cookie tins or custom-made batches on well-known platforms and niche marketplaces alike, using digital storefronts to broaden their audience. Even when people start by browsing broad platforms, they often end up finding local or artisan brands through community recommendations.

**Secondary Market and Social Selling**

In some cases, popular cookie brands or collectible tins (especially vintage or seasonal editions) become items that people seek out on secondary marketplaces. Browsing user listings on [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether can reveal discontinued cookie tins or limited-edition assortments that have nostalgic or collector value.

This new layer of online commerce — where food items, packaging, and seasonal specialties are resold and re-shared — adds another dimension to how butter cookies remain culturally relevant.

# Why Butter Cookies Still Matter Today

So, after centuries of baking, why do butter cookies continue to thrive in a world full of new dessert trends?

Here are some key reasons:

**1. Timeless Flavor and Texture**

The buttery richness, fine crumb, and gentle sweetness hit a universal flavor profile that appeals across ages and cultures. It’s familiar, comforting, and reliably delicious.

**2. Emotional and Cultural Meaning**

Butter cookies connect people to tradition, memory, and celebration — qualities that go beyond simple taste and tap into deeper human experience.

**3. Adaptability**

Whether simple or fancy, classic or modern, butter cookies can be made to suit different occasions, diets (even gluten-free or vegan variations), and flavor preferences.

**4. Accessibility for Home and Professional Bakers**

Easy enough for beginners yet adaptable for experts, butter cookies fit into every level of baking skill, helping keep them alive in kitchens worldwide.

**5. Online Visibility and Reach**

Digital marketplaces, social platforms, and online communities help spread butter cookie recipes, products, and innovations to global audiences, making them more discoverable and beloved than ever.

# Butter Cookies: More Than a Trend

Butter cookies are often humble. They don’t have the flash of layered cakes or the novelty of fusion pastries. But perhaps that’s their strength. Their simplicity becomes a canvas for creativity, nostalgia, and connection.

Whether you’re enjoying them with a hot cup of tea, baking them with family, sharing them as gifts, or discovering a new artisan variety online, butter cookies remain relevant because they speak to something universal: the joy of comfort, craft, and shared experience.

As long as people continue to seek out warmth in flavors and memories in simple pleasures, butter cookies will never go out of style.

1qrbht8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qrbht8/my_sister_joined_some_wellness_retreat_and_hasnt/,My Sister Joined Some ‘Wellness Retreat’ And Hasn’t Come Home Yet…Part 2,"Just finished up my first day at the retreat searching for my sister. Didn’t find her, but apparently the group she’s part of had a long hike and ‘mountain meditation’ that took up the entire day. At least that’s what the staff and some of the guests here who aren’t in her group and know her said. 

Had a lot of people walk up to me thinking I was Olivia, so I took that as an opportunity to explain why I’m even at this place. I got mostly passive aggressive responses to my situation. Lots of “She’s where she wants to be to heal” and “ You can check in on her for your family’s sake, but then leave out of respect for her peace.” 

Some people just flat out told me I shouldn’t be here unless I was going to ‘accept help for my own issues’, the hell do these people think they know about my issues? My only issue is my sister ditching her family to come out here with Katherine. I’m here to talk some sense into her, not buy in to this cult-ish bullshit. I swear though that if Olivia has been sharing some of my private life with these weirdos, she’s going to be in for it. I’d like to believe that she still knows better than to share my private life with random people I don’t know, but then again I never thought she’d get herself into a situation like this. 

This whole place puts me on edge. It makes my organs feel like they’re vibrating, just like how I used to feel back in high school before I knew it was a sign that I was going to have an anxiety attack. I took some deep breathes and tried to focus, but the feeling persists even now as I’m laying in this weirdly designed bedroom they assigned me. 

It consists of a bedroom, mini-kitchen, a study corner, and private bathroom. The entire bedroom floor is covered in a dark green moss colored shag carpet with an off-white plush rug on both sides of the bed near the nightstands, while the rest of the room has the same napoleon brown marble floors. The walls are all off-white with paintings hung up that have motivational quotes over nature photos. There’s a few amenities in the kitchen like a microwave, stove, mini-fridge, tea pot, and coffee maker. Feels like I’m in a hotel whose decorators had an extreme Feng Shui obsession. 

The creepiest thing in here though is the giant piece of crystal shaped like an old CRT TV sitting placed on a stand in front of the bed against the far wall. Makes me feel like I’m being watched…

When I drove into the parking area it was weirdly bare, especially for a place that boasted to be routinely fully booked every week on their socials. Most of the spots taken were for the therapists here and other employees, so I was able to find a spot near the entrance to the retreat grounds. 

After going through a gate and verifying who I was and that I wasn’t concealing anything dangerous on me or in my luggage, the receptionist woman began to explain everything to me with this big customer service smile stretched on her face the entire time. She explained what was included in my package, the optional events and therapies I could attend for no extra charge, the extensions I could make the day before my stay’s expiration date, and other boring nonsense that didn’t matter. I was only here for Olivia.

“We here at Ulexite Retreat hope you have a relaxing and healing week with us Oaklyn.” She said with that uncomfortable grin as she extended my room keycard to me.” This key is to your room, room 31A. Please head there first to deposit your luggage and to find your package amenities. If you’d like to check the list of available events for you today, check all events under your assigned group. According to your first time visitor status, you’ll be in Porcupine Group!” 

Finally a good thing, I’d hopefully be in the same group as Olivia since she’s only been here this once. I gave her a brief thanks and left reception to head to my room with my stuff, but had to stop and stare when I made it outside to the main hub area. 

The main hub was so green and lively and the ground was very hilly, there were so many people! Everyone looked happy and wore bright, but not neon, colors. Most of them didn’t even have shoes or sandals on. The grass was real but so perfectly trimmed it almost looked fake, the dirt pathways were kept in a way that made them actually look soft and pleasant to walk on. Made me think of a golf course almost, but without the lack of trees and sand traps. In fact, we were completely surrounded by trees out here. I couldn’t even see the parking lot from here because of them. 

The weirdest thing though was the massive crystals that seemed to be placed around as decoration. Giant white, semi-transparent, stones of varying shapes and sizes were placed around the hills of the courtyard hub. One huge stone in particular, shaped almost like a massive CRT TV from the 90s, sat on top a white marble display in the center of the courtyard. Some people seemed to be having a meditation class in front of it, sitting cross legged on their variously soft colored yoga mats. 

I thought to myself that someone had to have paid a pretty penny to set up all these crystals like this, unless they were all fake. In which case they were probably still all worth more than what I’d have for food and housing each month. Good thing Antonio paid for me to come here, otherwise I’d be broke.

There was a medium sized board off to the right of the main pathway with a map of the retreat and the scheduling for the different groups. Each group had their optional activities listed for the day along with who was in each group. Quickly I looked at the list for Porcupine Group only to find that Olivia wasn’t there. I can’t lie, that confused me and pissed me off a bit. 

I flagged down an employee, who stood out like a sore thumb wearing all white from head to toe grinning like a Cheshire Cat, and asked him what the hell was the deal with me not being in the same group as Olivia. 

“Ah must be that your friend had someone vouch for them and paid for an upgrade when they first arrived, happens sometimes when older members bring newcomers in that seem like they’ll fit in well here. I’m surprised your friend didn’t tell you about that system.” He said to me, giving me a slightly confused look.  

“She’s my sister, not just my friend. We’re twins.” I told him in a grumble.” Guess she was just too caught up in her time here to mention it.” I lied, before thanking him for letting me know and heading off towards the ‘apartments’. 

Once I’d unpacked, ignoring the complimentary amenities basket full of weird products and a spa rove, and tried talking to a few people about Olivia and was getting nowhere. I was about to give up for the next few hours, that is until I bumped into a woman who looked just as uneasy about this place as I was and we struck up a conversation. Thankfully, she’d met Olivia! 

Her name is Marisol, she looks to be around her late 20s, she’s very pale and freckled with these big dark blue eyes and curly brown hair. She’s also in the same group as me, Porcupine Group. Apparently the group names are all based on animals up here in Appalachia. Olivia is in the Vole Group with Katherine and a few other frequent guests. 

Marisol said she’s originally from Massachusetts and came here for the summer to get away from some stress at home. She arrived here a few days early with her older cousin Shannon, who has been here before a few times and is apparently in Katherine and Olivia’s group too. 

I asked about how Olivia seemed physically and mentally, and thank god Marisol was honest with me unlike most of the people here had been so far. 

“Katherine and Shan said she seemed fine to them when I’d asked the same thing, but your sister seems deeply troubled to me Oaklyn…and to be honest I don’t think it’s about her recent health crisis…” She said and anxiously bit at her thumbnail. 

“Please Marisol, nobody else here has said anything helpful. I need to know how she is, what’s going on with her. If you have any ideas, even anything most people would consider ridiculous, I’d be grateful if you’d tell me. I’m really worried about her.” I pleaded, taking her free hand and giving it a gentle squeeze. 

Marisol let out a nervous whine from behind her thumb before nodding.” Okay I’ll tell you what I think, but just please don’t mention it was me who told you.” I nodded emphatically and agreed to keep her opinion on this whole mess anonymous before she continued. 

“I think Katherine is trying to push your sister into a divorce and signing away her parental rights, I don’t know why exactly though. I’ve thought that maybe it’s that Katherine is interested in Olivia or something, but she didn’t seem like she was ever trying to be flirtatious or anything during their interactions I’ve seen.” She said while looking thoughtful.” If she is interested in Olivia however I do know that Katherine is a very jealous woman and wouldn’t want Olivia having any children to raise since she doesn’t.” 

Marisol then frowned and gave me a serious look. “Just yesterday she flew into a screaming tantrum when a girl in their group arrived back after a few months and announced her pregnancy to her friends there. Poor girl wasn’t even talking to Katherine, she’d just overheard her and some of the other group members congratulating her. Katherine called her a traitor, told her she didn’t deserve ‘such a blessing’. Poor thing is only 16, I told Katherine that I highly doubted that she got pregnant just to spite her but she practically bit my head off for saying that.” 

“Do you think that girl would talk to me about Katherine and Olivia too? Who is she?” I asked. 

Marisol pointed over towards the entrance to the massage therapy building where a small group of three women were gathered, all three of them visibly expecting but only one of them looked young enough to be 16. A short woman, at most 5’2, with light brown hair wearing a pale yellow maternity tank top and white harem pants with big slits down the sides exposing her thighs. 

”I’d wait until dinner to try talking to her about this, she usually eats out here picnic style by herself. I’m sure she’d be willing to talk to you about all this though, she’s really pissed off at Katherine for all the nasty things she said. Her name is Delilah, I could introduce you if you’d like? I don’t have plans to eat with Shan tonight since her group’ll be eating up in the mountains.” She offered with a kind genuine smile. Finally, a smile that was fake and eerie. 

I nodded and accepted the offer of an introduction at dinner. It was nice to have an ally here, I hoped she’d stay one if things got more intense. I had the feeling Katherine would fight tooth and nail to keep Olivia in her clutches. 

Marisol and I hung out doing the basic activities for Porcupine Group up until it was dinner time. Most of the activities were typical of wellness retreats, like easy yoga poses and a group therapy introductory session. I didn’t participate much in the activities where you needed to talk about personal shit, but I did my best to look like I actually wanted to be doing all these activities during the physical ones. Marisol made some light jokes here and there, she even managed to introduce me to a few staff members I might be able to get some information out of later if I go about it the right way. 

When dinner time came we both grabbed our trays and headed up to the counter when our group was called. Tonight’s dinner options all included a soup or salad. The options were some grilled fish dish (I think cod), oven roasted ham and veggies, or spinach feta pasta. I decided to go with the ham, people who picked salad made it themselves at the small salad bar so I figured I could just put a bunch of the shredded cheese in the little bowl instead of the salad. What can I say? I like shredded cheese and I’m not a rabbit. 

Poor Marisol looked damn near green when she accidentally locked eyes with the fish dish on display. She covered her mouth with her hand and shook her head, quietly requesting the pasta dish and a side salad even when the chef tried to tempt her into trying the fish. I swear she gagged a little when he wafted up the smell from the opening at the back of the heated display. 

I don’t know if she did that as an excuse for us to head outside to look for Delilah or not, but it was convenient if not purposeful. We headed out after grabbing our food with the excuse of getting some air and quickly found Delilah seated on a white picnic blanket with her food reading softly to her belly from a book that had old yellowing pages. 

Marisol introduced us and Delilah was just about to start talking about some concerning interactions she’d seen between Olivia and Katherine when all of a sudden a loud hissing war cry came out of the nearby bushes as an orange cat leapt out of them and started to attack Delilah. Marisol and I both tried to get the little menace off of her, but it was latched to the front of her shirt with all of its claws while hissing and screeching like a demon while occasionally letting go with one hand to swipe at her face. 

Thankfully a member of staff heard the commotion and rushed over to help, roughly snatching the cat by its scruff and pulling it off of Delilah. Her shirt had some small scuffs and scratches from where the claws scrambled to keep purchase, but finally she was free. With an exhausted sigh she winced as she touched her face, slight scratches along her jaw and chin. She frowned deeply and pointed at the cat, scolding it.” I told you to leave me alone you little bastard! Ryan why hasn’t this cat been removed from mousing already?! It’s attacked me three times already since I got back!” She asked the employee with a mix of confusion and anger on her face. 

Ryan, an absolute Goliath of a man with long hair, gave her an apologetic look and kept the cat held up by the scruff as it continued to hiss and squirm.

“I’m mighty sorry Delilah, but he just keeps on escapin’ out of the cat house! He’s a squirmy one!” He said remorsefully with his southern drawl. Looking at the cat with a glare he frowned,” I’ll try to make sure he can’t escape again. Please go see the nurse, cat scratches can be bad even though they’ve got all their shots here.” He added. 

Ryan then turned to look at Marisol and I before giving us a smile and gesturing with his free hand towards the bedrooms,” I’d be in both of y’all’s debt if you’d take Delilah with ya to the rooms. House Nurse is down the hall to the right from the main lobby. Besides it’s almost time for shut-eye!” 

Marisol and I both nodded, gently guiding Delilah to where he instructed. The cat was twisting in his grasp screeching like a banshee that was set on fire. Delilah had a dark look in her eyes as she looked back at the cat and stuck her tongue out at it and childishly blew a raspberry its way. The yowling screech grew louder and Ryan shook his head taking off towards where the retreat kept its cats that were meant to help control the rodents that might show up in the retreat. 

After we dropped Delilah off at the nurse, Marisol and I parted ways. I trudged up to my room with an uneasy feeling in my guts, that vibrating feeling back now more so than even before. I locked the door behind me and flopped onto the bed with a sigh, turning to look at the weird tv stone and wishing more than anything that it was just an actual television. 

Today was…something. At least I made some allies and acquainted myself with some staff. Tomorrow Olivia should be back from the mountains and I should be able to talk to her, hopefully without much trouble from Katherine. I briefly FaceTimed with Antonio to update him on everything, showed him the weird bedroom too. I promised him I’d do whatever I could to convince Olivia to come home tomorrow. We said our goodnight and ended the call, things feeling a little sour as hope for tomorrow felt a bit slim. 

I hope Olivia makes this easy on me and just agrees to come home, but I have a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Something’s really not right here at Ulexite Retreat. ",2,1769793225.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

This morning my husband and I both had dentist appointments. We have basically the same diet which is admittedly low in sugar - but me I drink way more coffee than him and I have two to three glasses of wine a week and he almost never drinks. We both brush our teeth well. My husband sees the dentist every year, and I haven’t seen a dentist in six. It took 15 min to get the plaque off my husband’s teeth, and he was told to be more careful. The dentist told me I had very little plaque and I was out of the chair in a couple minutes. Can’t know for sure, but maybe the xylitol is what’s kept my teeth so clean - my teeth are also very white and I don’t do any whitening. 

It got my thinking about how little bits of advice and information can have a positive or negative ripple effect in people’s lives. I’m curious what other people have heard on the podcast that has had a positive effect on their lives / habits. 

Especially if anything is recent, I don’t listen to the podcast anymore because I come from a family of boomer Republicans and don’t need to hear those talking points from a show I was listening to before for aliens and conspiracy theories and health tips. ",4,1769793152.0,JoeRogan,9,0.64,False

_Chapter 6_

***The Start of Winter, 1863***

Elbee unrolled the copper wires and tied them off to a box. His “teacher”, Jason Maris was unrolling another one to another box and was smiling like mad.

“Now, Elbee, what do you think will happen with you between these two boxes set to take a charge?” Maris asked.

“Well, one, I question how we know it will work. But two, if it does it could help us learn how to store an electrical bolt of lightning.” Elbee sighed. 

He had been learning about the uses of electricity from his former school teacher turned “mad scientist"" when he found he could generate an electrical blast, a startling change from his normal power which had been the ability to control and read ink in any form for centuries. That changed rapidly once he encountered his teacher’s “charge boxes”. They were currently setting up in a recently abandoned graveyard outside of town.

“That’s the beauty of it Elbee, we don’t know!” Maris laughed, “But we’ll record the data to study it!” 

“You know, I’m not a huge fan of this...” Elbee put his coil of wires down. “Maybe we should try something smaller.” 

“Elbee, we have nothing to worry about.” Maris said, “We’re not shooting the electricity at you, We’re trying to get you to charge the boxes!” 

Elbee shook his head, “Sir, this is madness.” 

“It’s science.” Maris laughed, “Learning often looks like madness at the start.”

Elbee shook his head and rolled the remaining copper wire up. 

“Let me get to the control box.” Maris said as he took his spool with him and stood inside a small wooden shack with a small slat for a window. Once he was inside he called out. “Okay, let’s get you in the middle.”

Elbee sighed and took his spot in between both boxes with their strange metal prongs. He then tried to focus the electrical bursts he had begun to harness, but nothing came forth. He looked around and shrugged at his teacher.

“Maybe we need an impetus.” Maris called out. “The first time you were surprised by the falling shelf.” 

“So how do you propose to surprise me here, in a graveyard?” Elbee shot back.

“I could tell a scary story.” Maris offered.

“Sir...” Elbee sighed, “I think we need to-” Elbee jumped as he felt a shiver run down his spine. A feeling he hadn’t felt in centuries. A Revenant had just been reborn from a defeat. The shock of it sparked bolts of electricity from his entire body and each one jumped to the charge box closest to it.

“Excellent!” Maris clapped, then paused. “Elbee, what surprised you?” 

“We need to go.” Elbee shouted, ""Something isn’t right. There’s another Revenant.”

“You can sense them?” Maris gasped, “Fascinating.”  \

“I sense when they awaken...” Elbee explained. “Maddock and Raine sense them after a while.” He went to get his teacher when a hand grabbed his shoulder. He was then spun to face a tall, wide bellied man with a ragged beard and plaid skin, as if just woken from death.

“Boy, do you know the whore with the large blade?” The man grunted.

Elbee’s mind flitted through multiple ideas and plans but settled on the only one he knew would give Maris a chance. “SIR! DISCHARGE THE BOXES!” 

Maris flipped a switch and all at once the electricity was released and blasted out towards the two closest objects. For Elbee it was painless and felt like a buzz running along his arms and legs. The large revenant, however, was thrown back and spasming

“Run!” Elbee shouted as he bolted for his teacher. As he looked around he watched graves dig themselves up and cattle rustlers that had been rotting returned to the Earth. “Don’t look back!” Elbee pushed himself to keep behind his teacher to make sure the man had a chance.

After an hour of running and hiding the two found themselves at the Lucky Shue Ranch. Elbee ran straight for his home. Jason Maris ran for his former employers. Both ran in screaming.

“Elbee.” Maddock leaned out from the kitchen as he drank his coffee. “What has got you in a tear?” 

“Undead!” Elbee shouted.

Maddock just blinked and nodded.

“No. Not us. The rustlers are back!” Elbee clarified.

Maddock shot up as his shadow placed the coffee mug back on the table. “Get Raine. Keep the ranch safe.” Maddock’s entire outfit shifted to his old green cloak and hood as shadows reached around and swapped his clothes and armor. 

“You getting Lattimer?” Elbee asked.

“And warning the town. He’ll no doubt want revenge.” Maddock nodded.

“He’s also got an army of corpses.” Elbee added.

“The hell?” Maddock blinked, “That’s a new one.” Then he paused. “Charles.” 

“Get the smiley bastard safe with the others.” Elbee nodded, “I’ll get Raine and we’ll get the place safe.” 

Maddock laughed, “You can try and convince her of that.” Maddock stepped into his own shadow and slipped through corridors of darkness and light, emerging in Lattimer’s office, but it was already torn to pieces.

He looked around and realized the Revenant had moved with an unholy speed to find the exact spot to start his revenge. He stepped out of the office and into the town. People were injured and moving the few dead and immobile. Mrs. Manchester was ordering people to get the injured into the casino, it was the most well guarded building. She caught sight of Maddock and waved him over.

“You just got here, good. Bastard took Lattimer and his usual posse.” She explained.

“I’ll get Raine, we’ll get them.” Maddock said.

“Where’s Maggie, you’ll need to ride fast.” Mrs. Manchester looked around in confusion.

A swirling mass opened at Maddock’s feet, a tint of red swirled in as some of the blood from the dead and injured mixed in. Raine rose from the mixture, her sky blue cloak and armor odd, but her massive scythe was the true draw of her newest look to the town.

“We travel by other means.” Raine said darkly. “The bastard’s back?” 

Maddock nodded and the two turned to leave but were stopped as Mrs. Manchester spoke again. “Lattimer’s shot. I think in the gut. Get him back fast.”

Maddock nodded as he opened another portal to a human shape not far outside of the city. He kneeled as he recognized Denny’s body, his eyes wide open in shock.

“Denny...” Raine whimpered, “He’s getting his revenge on us all.”

Maddock slipped off his glove and flinched as he saw a madness born of greed and desire. He couldn’t make sense of what he saw, many of his friends in pain. Charles being whipped as they were marched. Then Denny was dead, the man never saw who killed him. He stood and shook his head, closing the man’s eyes for the last time.

“He’s greed, or something like it.” Maddock said as he focused. “More...” He opened another portal and they stepped through to another body.

Again Maddock kneeled down and closed his friend’s eyes, but it was Raine who noticed the posing. 

“Maddock, it’s pointin’.” She nodded to the man’s arm. “He posed Marcus’ body.” She was clearly gritting her teeth. 

Maddock put the man’s arm by his side, slightly grateful that the situation had happened as fast as it did, leaving little time for the body to become stiff. He reached out once again and stood with a shock, then opened the portal. The twins stepped through and saw Lattimer at the edge of the gulch holding his stomach, several more wounds bled freely.

“Mr. Lattimer.” Raine dropped her scythe and tried to focus his blood back into his body.

“Ain’t no good.” Lattimer laughed, “It’s a cursed weapon. Cursed soul that did this.” 

“We need to get you back, the town...” Maddock was about topen a portal.

“The town knows the law.” Lattimer coughed, “But what it needs now is Justice.” He grabbed Maddock’s arm and pulled him in. “That’s what you are. Not this twisted anger, you’re better’en that. All of you. You’re all bein’ lied to.” He hissed and then a final gasp. 

“Lattimer.” Maddock shook the man’s arm but there was no response. “Lattimer. Boss.” He shook the man’s shoulders. Then in shock he began to sob.

Raine let her brother sob for as long as she felt she could. “Maddock, we still got others. He still has Charlie.” 

“Man hates that name.” Maddock wiped his eyes and nodded, “But you’re right, we got people to save.” He closed Lattimer’s eyes.

“There’s more.” Raine pointed in a direction towards the gulch. “Most dead.”

Maddock nodded and with a focused will the shadows crept out from him and latched onto the bodies of those taken. Then in moments they were arranged outside the casino in Bottom Rung, arms folded and eyes closed.

“We’re ending this.” Maddock stood and opened a portal directly into the cavern they had been in earlier in the year. “He’s got Charlie still.” They looked around and heard the sound of a gong.

“You’ve got to be kiddin’.” Raine snortred.

“Come on in!” A voice shouted. “Guests of honor.” 

“I’m gonna kill him again...” Raine said as she walked in with her brother to an adjoining room. 

Torches lined the wall of the large cavern room, in the center was a gallows with a beaten and bruised Charles “Smiles” Smith. Despite his state he was grinning and brimming with confidence. Maddock looked around at the undead rustlers and then to their leader who sat upon a throne made of discarded wood and bone.

“Try not to move too much Charles.” Maddock said calmly.

“Didn’t plan on it.” Charles chuckled.

“Hiya fucker, remember me?” Raine grinned, “‘Cause I remember you.” 

“Hello whore! Glad we could meet again!” The revenant laughed. “I am Captain Grennor. Sailor of seas and-” 

Several risen corpses fell to pieces as Raine rushed forward and drug her scythe’s massive blade through the bodies. Bones shattered and splintered, what little rotten meat was left flew all over the cavern. 

“My sister has grievances.” Maddock said, “And I have vengeance to deliver.” 

“Oh, you could. You could, but you aren’t the ‘kill a Revenant’ type.” Grennor laughed, “You’re one of ‘The Lord’s’ chosen! And I am something far more primal.” 

“Then we’ll put you down like the mad dog you are.” Raine growled as she leaped at Grennor he larged blade swinging down like an axe.

Despite his massive frame the Revenant was able to dodge the equally large blade and he looked on in surprise. Maddock took the time to rush the gallows and free his friend, first removing his neck from the noose and then his hands.

“Thanks Maddie.” Charles coughed, “Got a gun?” 

“Sorry. None of the bodies had any.” Maddock said. 

“Yeah, he’s gott’em all.” Charles quickly slid behind the gallows as Raine and Grennor flew past the him and Maddock.

“They’ll be at this for a moment. What do you know?”  Maddock asked.

“He’s been on a rant about how he’s unkillable, tied to Avarice and all that.” Charles nodded, “Near as I can tell your weapons should do it, or his.” 

“The Flintlock.” Maddock watched his sister and the bulbous man bounce from one end of the cavern like a pair of maddened squirrels chasing each other.

“Yup.” Charles sniffed, “I think your pa knew what was comin’.” 

“It fits with his style. I make a friend and he can’t have it.” Maddock sighed, “I can get it, can you take the shot.” 

Charles nodded, “Wait, you can’t?” 

“Believe it or not we’ve never learned to use them.” Maddock sighed.

Charles laughed, “Of course you didn’t. Yeah I can take it. You thinkin’ all three?”

“Best way to be sure.” Maddock nodded.

In a blink he was on Grennor’s back struggling to reach for the flintlock on his belt. Then just as fast the large Revenant grabbed him and threw him to the ground and drew the flintlock. Grennor fired without hesitation but Maddock had already slipped away from his sights. Then once again Maddock was on Grennor’s side, trying to wrench the gun from his hands, only the man’s grip was like iron. Maddock looked around and caught his sister’s glances, he nodded to the Revenant’s arm. Maddock used his shadows to pull Grennor’s arm wide from his body and Raine came in screaming like the spirit she took the name of, their attack left Grennor screaming in rage as his arm was freed from his body. Maddock quickly kicked the arm and the weapon to Charles.

“Go ahead...” Grennor laughed, “Kill me, but I’ll be back. Ain’t nothing more I want than vengeance.” 

“Well that’s a shame.” Charles laughed with a wide, perverse smile, ""Because he’s Vengeance incarnate.” 

“Vengeance is mine sayeth the lord.” Maddock drew back his black hilted blade.

“I’m just glad to gut a pig again.” Raine added.

Grennor laughed. “I’ll be ba-” 

He was cut off as two blades pierced him. Maddock’s dagger sunk into his heart and Raine’s scythe tore his gut open. It was silent as Charles approached Grennor and grinned as he pulled the trigger, but as he did so Grennor took a fishing knife from his belt and drove it into Charles’ side. Black blood poured out as the back of Grennor’s skull exploded.

“Charles!” Maddock rushed forward.

“Strupid idiot!” Raine rushed forward as well, trying to separate the blood from the septic toxins of the man’s liver. “I already lost someone, Maddie doesn’t need to too.” 

Maddock took his gloves off to make sure he could feel his friend’s heart. As he did so a vision struck him; Charles pulled the trigger on several of the dead posse and he did it gleefully to keep the whip from his back. Then he felt Charles’ heart beat stop. He slid away and stared in shock. 

“What’s wrong?” Raine asked.

“He was just as rotten as the rest. He shot Denny. He shot most of them except Lattimer.” Maddock stood up and kicked the corpse. “You traitor.” 

Raine stood, “Burying him still?” 

“Away from the rest.” Maddock nodded. “Bastard...” 

Then the torches dimmed to a barely present light. Maddock and Raine both froze, turned to face Grennor’s corpse and waited. Nothing stirred from Grenor’s corpse. It was Charles who sprang back to life, immediately ignited by an unknown source, then all at once the flame retreated into his body and his wounds healed perfectly. The torches then returned to their normal state.

Charles laughed and jumped for joy.

“Am I seein’ this?” Maddock asked his sister.

“You are.” Raine leaned on her scythe. “We still buryin’ the fucker?” 

“Bury me?” Charles laughed, “I’m back. I’m better than back. I’m like you.” He pointed, “Immortal, reborn. Lattimer will hate this.” 

“Lattimer’s dead.” Maddock said coldly, “Just like the others, you shot.” 

“Maddie...” Charles sighed, “I had to, he was going to torture them. With me it was at least quick.” 

“You enjoyed it!” Maddock snarled as the shadows began to wrap around him.

“Maddie...” Charles began.

“Do not call me that!” Maddock roared, “Only friends can call me that.” 

“We are friends. Maddie and Smiles.” Charles looked at Maddock with hope. “Maddie, Raine and Smiles then. With Lil’ Elbee.” 

“You crossed a line.” Raine snapped, “You killed friends. You know how they felt?”

“I do, but I know I’d want friends to make it quick versus a madman’s torture.” Charles snapped. “And it’s Smiles now. If Lattimer’s gone, I’m gonna at least respect him.” 

Maddock glared at Charles Smith. “I don’t want you near me.” 

Smiles blinked and looked confused. “I don’t understand, I’m like you.” 

“You’re a bastard.” Raine snapped, “We’ve killed, but never friends. Not like this.”

“We can work this out.” Smiles pleaded. 

“I don’t want you near me!” Maddock roared as the curse pulsed through his body and the shadows swallowed the man now known as Smiles.

Raine watched her brother break down after. He collapsed to his knees sobbing once again. She ended up helping him walk out and getting back home. The days after had them attending multiple funerals and quickly leaving, heading back to New York where they would once again meet up with their old friends.

***=-=Post Smiles=-=***

Karma looked at Maddock, then Raine, then Elbee. Then she looked at Cardinal and Spaz. Then she nodded and sighed.

“That’s about our reaction too.” Cardinal laughed. “He did a number on them.” 

“I still don’t know where he ended up.” Maddock nodded, “But I lost a lot that day. We lost a lot that day.” 

“Charlie always was an asshole.” Raine sighed, “But he was your friend, for a time.” 

Maddock nodded, “Still don’t know why Lattimer didn’t tell me it was him.” 

“He told you what you needed to hear.” Karma said, “He knew you would find out and that you would bring justice. But how come you haven’t gone after Smiles since then?” Karma asked.

“He’s made deals with Infernals and the like. Keeps making more power for himself.” Maddock sighed. “He’s come after the others once or twice...”

“More when you disappeared.” Elbee said.

Maddock nodded, “He’s mad, refuses to accept we aren’t friends anymore. It’s sick but because it’s the one thing he wants...” 

“Oh god.” Karma realized what it meant, “He can’t have it so it makes his power and drive all the greater.” 

“And vengeance isn’t justice.” Maddock sighed, “It’s a selfish impulse to impart pain for one wrong on another. It is cruel and vicious.” 

“But you didn’t kill him.” Karma said, “You sent him away.” 

“He did end up in Australia.” Spaz added. “I did some searching when Raine told me at the time. It never seemed important, but I should have told you.” 

Maddock chuckled, “Now that’s how you end a story.” 

“No, you generally end a story at the end.” Cardinal pointed out. “This was just an interlude.” 

“Big story was the World Wars and the Purge.” Elbee confirmed.

“You lot at least remember World War II.” Maddock scoffed. “Touched one SS Officer and bam I’m off on a killin’ spree that pulled in a fallen-feckin-angel.” 

“I’m sorry.” Karma blinked.

“Long, complicated story.” Elbee sighed. “Long and short of it, we contributed to saving as many people as we could.” He pointed to himself, Spaz and Cardinal. “And Raine did her level best to keep Maddock from killing all of the Nazi’s in a splash of darkness.” 

“Why?” Karma asked in shock.

“Because I couldn’t, one.” Maddock laughed, “But I did give it my damndest. Not even the curse could track what was happening. It was pure bloody vengeance born of rage and hatred and I believe it best never to have those memories. And two, even if I could, it wouldn’t have stopped it as we knew it. People had to stand against evil, not a Revenant.""  

“Of course he did drag me all over Europe and parts of Asia during that time.” Spaz sighed.

“Why do I barely remember China?” Maddock blinked. “And Japan?” 

“He isn’t welcome in Japan. The Kami are a spectacularly protective bunch. Even of war criminals.” Spaz grumbled.

“The hell did you two do there?” Cardinal blinked in confusion. 

“Lies and vengeance.” Spaz smiled with a faux sweetness.

“The Purge however, we loved fighting them.” Raine smiled, “Nothing breaks quite like a hive mind watching a shadow twist one of’em in half. Or the blood of their victims turning into an unstoppable golem.” 

“Fair enough...” Maddock sighed, “Guess it’s time we get to the thrillin’ heroics part of the story. And away from War crimes I can’t remember.” 

Karma smiled and clapped nervously.

“We are circling back to that later.” Cardinal looked at Spaz in concern.

“Same.” Elbee steepled his hands .”Cardinal has a point.” 

“They’re agreeing.” Raine looked at her glass of wine. “And I’m out.”

“I brought some as well.” Spaz smiled.

Raine got up and stumbled to the kitchen

“We are an eclectic bunch.” Maddock laughed, “But...” 

“It was the one time we didn’t have to deal with the curses.” Elbee beamed with a happy smile, “We actually were heroes. I miss it.” 

Maddock paused, “You’re still a hero Elbee. We’ll get you in that school. You’ll see.” 

“So anyway...” Raine put another bottle down and slid it to Maddock. “Open please...” 

Maddock sighed and opened the bottle for his sister.

“So anyway...” Raine smiled, “The Purge set off their invasion and we was all here...” 

“Oh Lord, she actually reached drunk for the Irish.” Cardinal sighed.

“I’m so glad I stopped.” Elbee sipped on some water.

Maddock gestured wildly about, “Who the hell’s tellin’ the story here?” 

“You, ya daft bastard!” Raine giggled, “I just wanted to set the scene.” 

Maddock shook his head with a smile as he started .”It was the only time I wasn't ashamed to be called ‘The Wraith’...”

We are seriously considering buying a newer home (built in 2024) but I am really concerned about the size and layout of the main floor living room and downstairs family room given the price of the home (450k).

The downstairs family room (143 sqft) has a nice wet bar but it’s placed in such a way that it could make it awkward to arrange a sectional couch, coffee table, mounted TV, and small play area for our toddler.

I’m currently layered like an onion, drinking coffee that’s doing most of the heavy lifting, and pretending this is all very normal behavior for a grown adult man.

There’s something about Midwest winters that make people a little softer, a little funnier, and way more open to conversation with a stranger who also owns too many hoodies.

So here’s my pitch:

If we were snowed in together for the afternoon, what’s your role?

• You making fun of me for over-salting the driveway

• You picking the music and judging my taste

• You insisting it’s “actually kinda cozy”

• Or you suggesting a Kwik Trip run like it’s a romantic errand

I’m easygoing, quick to laugh, and fully prepared to admit winter is better when there’s good company involved.

No pressure. No weirdness. Just Midwest charm, slow Friday energy, and maybe a little flirting between snowflakes.

It came in spells.

Most of the time my vision was fine, but when it hit, I knew something was wrong. My sight blurred. My eyes throbbed, and I saw motion that wasn’t there.

During those spells, I might be looking at my desk or watching TV at home, when suddenly I’d see things moving—subtle, distant motion—like something shifting just out of focus. But when the blurriness faded, so did the movement.

I told my parents about it, and at first they were hopeful it would just go away. In Clearview, most of us treated the eye doctor as a last resort. The stories surrounding that office made people reluctant to make an appointment. But I kept complaining, and eventually I reached a point where anything felt better than continuing to deal with it.

So my mom called Dr. Wroble’s office and got me an appointment for the next day.

She offered to drive me, but I assured her I’d be fine. Besides, the appointment got me out of school, which was a welcome bonus.

The next day, in the middle of fourth period, I left class and walked out to the parking lot where my car waited. The lot was desolate, as was the drive to Dr. Wroble’s office. The eerie quiet of Clearview in the middle of the day stirred up memories of the stories I’d heard—about the office and about Dr. Wroble himself.

There were stories of patients looking through his instruments and seeing increasingly gruesome or deeply unwelcome scenes involving themselves or their families. Stories about the eye drops—drops that let you see creatures that weren’t really there, but also caused weeks of your life to slip by as though they were minutes.

Most of the stories focused on Dr. Wroble himself: his round, flat glasses, which often obscured his eyes behind a thick glare, and his smile—a smile that made you crave to be anywhere else.

Still, for all the uncanny rumors surrounding his practice, no one ever questioned his competence. He fixed eyes. And I hoped he would fix mine.

I pulled into the strip mall where Dr. Wroble’s office sat between a Chinese food restaurant and a Weight Watchers. I parked in the nearly empty lot and walked through the glass storefront into his practice.

The waiting room was empty. A sliding mirror, where the receptionist presumably sat, was closed. I never actually saw her during my visit.

I wrote my name on a sign-in sheet, clipped it to the clipboard on the front desk, and sat down to wait.

A moment later, the mirror slid open. A thin, bony hand reached out, took the clipboard, and the mirror slid shut again.

I tried to distract myself with the outdated magazines on the coffee table, but it wasn’t long before the door opened.

Dr. Wroble stood there, dressed entirely in white, peering at me through the thick lenses of his glasses.

“Eliot,” he said.

I gave him a polite smile and stood to follow him down the hall. The office itself looked like any other doctor’s office I’d been to—sterile fluorescent lighting, muted colors, and anatomical posters showing body parts and the things that could go wrong with them.

He led me into a dimly lit room filled with instruments and equipment. I sat down in a large chair facing the machines.

Dr. Wroble pulled up a chair beside me and sat down.

“So, Eliot,” he said, “I hear we’re having some trouble with our eyes. Can you tell me what’s been going on?”

I tried to look at him through the glare of his round glasses, but I could only look for so long until I averted my eyes.

""Well,"" I said, trying to ignore his overall creepy demeanor, ""my vision keeps getting blurry. And when it does, I feel like I'm seeing things that aren't really there.""

""Does this happen in any place or at any time in particular?""

""Now that I think about it,"" I replied, ""it happens when I'm at school and in my room. I don't remember it happening anywhere else.""

""School makes sense,"" he muttered to himself. ""But the room...""

Dr. Wroble closed his eyes and rubbed his chin with his palm. After a moment, he began nodding, as if having made up his mind about something. He took off his glasses and looked me in the eye.

Removing the glasses was like he had taken off a mask. The man who had seconds ago been unsettling now looked perfectly normal. Perhaps even friendly.

""I think I may know what's causing your issue,"" said Dr. Wroble. ""But there's a test that will tell us for sure. Come with me.""

We exited the room, but instead of turning back toward the entrance, we continued down the hall until we reached a door that looked unlike the others. It was old and wooden, featuring a large brass doorknob. Dr. Wroble opened the door and led me through. The room looked like an office, but only half of it. The other half was empty, but for the small wooden box at the far end of the white-tiled floor.

""Stand here, Eliot,"" Dr. Wroble said, motioning to a spot on the floor across from the box.

Obediently, I moved to the spot. Though the nerves I felt earlier had crept back in. This felt nothing like an eye exam.

""Any vision problems?""

I shook my head.

""Take a step forward... Anything?""

""Nope,"" I replied.

""One more.""

As I took another step, my vision blurred worse than ever before. And the movements, they were clearer. Whatever was moving was in that box, throughout the walls and under my feet.

Dr. Wroble must have noticed my shock because he never even asked me about my vision.

""I thought so,"" he said.

Then I felt something on my hand. Dr. Wroble had reached out and grabbed it. Gently.

My vision returned to normal.

""What happened?"" I asked through heavy breaths.

""It looks like you may be a conduit.""

""A what?"" I asked, not expecting my eye condition to include me *being* anything.

Dr. Wroble pulled me by my hand toward the box.

""Open it.""

I looked over to Dr. Wroble, whose face was calm and reassuring. He said nothing else, but gave me a slow nod.

I leaned over with my free arm and grasped the lid of the box. Slowly, I lifted the lid and recoiled when I saw what was inside. The movement I saw while in my blurry spell now played out in front of me. A fleshy tendril, that I had reluctantly come to know as a part of RYNE, pulsed in the box before me, slowly passing through two holes in the bottom of the box, as if a snake slithering from one side to the other.

""It's okay, Eliot,"" Dr. Wroble said. ""It won't hurt you.""

I stood before the open box, staring at the thing inside.

""Touch it.""

I shuddered, but reached out and moved my shaking hand toward the box. When my fingers met the tendril, Dr. Wroble let go of my hand. In an instant, my vision went hazy again. Everything in front of me faded away, and flashes of other scenes passed before my eyes. I saw the insides of houses, hallways in my school, and roads I recognized from around town. None of the visions lasted long; each one came quick on the heels of the last.

This continued until I felt Dr. Wroble's hand on my wrist, pulling my arm away from RYNE.

""What did you see?"" he asked.

My eyes burned; my breath was ragged. I struggled to find the words to explain what I saw.

""Everything,"" I said.

Dr. Wroble's face lit up.

“Finally,” he said. “Another conduit.” He exhaled, something like relief in his voice. “It’s been lonely being the only one for the last decade.”",5,1769792908.0,MattBenjamin,1,1.0,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1qrb8im,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1qrb8im/preground_lavazza_vs_specialty_beans_one_works/,"Pre-ground lavazza vs specialty beans - one works, the other does not","Ok, this is something I have been noticing consistently for a long time and has been bugging me. I occasionally buy ""fancy"" locally-roasted beans and I grind them in my old Starbucks grinder. The moka coffee that comes out of them is rarely good - either has unpleasant aftertastes, or it is sour or bitter (most frequently sour). Dialing in requires endless tinkering (hot water vs cold water, basket fill level, etc.) and even in the best case the result is so-so (I can taste more complex notes, but overall it is not that great). Also, every time I change beans (even at the same roast level) I have to restart the whole process from scratch.

Conversely, if I buy something like pre-ground Lavazza, I can get a very smooth and drinkable coffee and it is almost impossible to screw it up. Sure, it will be possibly ""less interesting"" than specialty coffee, but very nice and comforting. No need to worry about high vs low heat etc., it ""just works"".

The obvious solution here is to just buy pre-ground grocery coffee, but it is a bit of a pity because sometimes I like to try different specialty beans, and I can get a pretty decent cup out of those using other methods (e.g., French Press).

1qrb5op,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1qrb5op/where_is_cannabis_legal_in_europe/,Where Is Cannabis Legal In Europe?,"**April 2024,** Germany legalized recreational Cannabis becoming the largest country in Europe to turn green. And the rest of the European Union is right behind them. There are currently 28 EU countries with some form of legalization, [either for medical marijuana](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2025/09/12/this-pharma-billionaire-is-developing-a-cannabis-painkiller-to-replace-dangerous-opioids/) or adult use. For now, the EU market is small compared to the $32 billion U.S market when it comes to legal cannabis sales—but it’s growing. In 2025, EU sales hit $1.7 billion, according to a report by Prohibition Partners. It is projected to reach $2.4 billion by the end of this year and $3.8 billion in annual sales by 2029, or more than a 124% jump from last year.

Germany, the EU’s largest economy, is the continent’s largest legal Cannabis market with about $944 million in sales last year, up from $500 million in sales at the end of 2024. The UK, which has not been part of the EU since Brexit in 2020, currently has a legal medical market with about $322 million in annual sales.

Compared to the United States—where [40 states have legalized medical use](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2025/01/03/where-is-cannabis-legal-a-guide-to-all-50-states/) and 24 states permit recreational use—Europe’s cannabis market is about the size of New York’s marijuana economy, which hit $1.5 billion in sales in 2025. And while President Donald Trump [issued an executive order in December 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2025/12/18/president-trump-to-reschedule-cannabis-as-less-dangerous-drug/) directing his Attorney General to reschedule marijuana as a less dangerous drug, no laws have been changed at the federal level, meaning Cannabis is still banned and cannabis companies cannot access the public markets. But in Europe—especially in countries like Germany, which made marijuana federally legal—the potential upside and sensible regulations that allow cannabis to be grown in Spain and Portugal and exported to other countries legally, has created a solid economic thesis for companies to [invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the burgeoning EU cannabis industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2025/05/25/with-federal-legalization-stalled-cannabis-companies-are-finding-a-new-green-rush-in-europe/).

Will Muecke, an American who cofounded the London-based marijuana-focused private equity firm Artemis Growth Partners, which has nearly $400 million in assets under management, says Europe is still a better investment opportunity than the U.S. He is currently raising $200 million for Artemis’ seventh fund. About 75% of the capital will be invested in Europe, while the rest will be deployed in South America and the Caribbean. No capital will be invested in the United States.

“We have a large U.S. portfolio, we care about the U.S., and I love that Trump came out with the executive order but it’s not a game changer,” says Muecke, explaining that a move to Schedule III will not open up public markets, nor will it allow institutional capital to be safely invested in the U.S. cannabis industry. “But Europe is a fast-growing industry with well-honed operators and a fully legal framework. I’m not in the shadows. The U.S. doesn’t have this yet, but Europe has that today.”

Here are the cannabis laws across Europe and the United Kingdom for 2026.

# Adult Use

Only four European countries have legalized adult-use Cannabis but these programs are unlike adult-use markets in the U.S. There are not hundreds of dispensaries, but rather non-profit clubs where members can obtain marijuana.

* **Malta:** In 2021, the smallest country in the European Union, became the first to legalize and regulate cannabis for personal use. The law allows for the possession and cultivation of marijuana. Residents can grow up to four plants and while it lacks a commercial market like U.S. states that have legalized adult-use, people can buy cannabis products from non-profit cooperatives.
* **Luxembourg:** In 2023, the EU financial hub legalized adult-use cannabis but still prohibits sales. Households can grow up to four plants under strict rules and private consumption by people 18 and older is legal. The country legalized medical marijuana in 2018.
* **Germany:** The continent’s largest economy legalized adult-use in 2024, allowing possession of up to 50 grams and growing three plants at home. Like Malta, Germany did not legalize commercial stores, but rather have allowed non-profit cannabis social clubs where members can obtain Cannabis. Germany also has a medical marijuana market, which allows doctors to prescribe cannabis to patients.
* **Czech Republic:** The country famous for its castles and beer, [legalized personal use of marijuana](https://www.podnikatel.cz/aktuality/konopi-a-marihuana-pro-osobni-potrebu-budou-do-urciteho-mnozstvi-legalni/) for adults in 2026. Commercial sales are still illegal, but Czechs can grow up to three pot plants at home and possession of up to 100 grams of weed is legal. The country decriminalized marijuana in 2010 and legalized medical marijuana in 2013.

# Medical Marijuana

Medical marijuana programs across Europe vary greatly but most only allow cannabis products to be dispensed through pharmacies. Some countries, such as Cyprus, only allow cannabis oil. Denmark permits pharmaceutical cannabis-based drugs such as Sativex, but also botanical forms of marijuana under a pilot program. The United Kingdom’s program allows for flower.

* **Cyprus**
* **Czech Republic**
* **Denmark**
* **France (medical marijuana pilot program has been extended** [**until March 2026**](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F35817?lang=en)**)**
* **Greece**
* **Italy**
* **North Macedonia**
* **Norway**
* **Portugal**
* **Romania (low THC only)**
* **Switzerland**
* **Ukraine**
* **United Kingdom**

# Decriminalization

There are now four countries in the EU that have broadly decriminalized marijuana. The largest is Spain, which has a confusing approach to cannabis policy that has resulted in both a [thriving grey market](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/12/spains-cannabis-dilemma-mirrors-problems-faced-by-u-s-states-00125584), where sales are technically illegal, as well as a government-approved cultivation program that allows companies to grow marijuana and export to other countries. Similarly, the Netherlands has a policy of “[toleration](https://www.government.nl/topics/drugs/toleration-policy-regarding-soft-drugs-and-coffee-shops)” when it comes to marijuana—which it classifies as a “soft drug”—permitting Amsterdam’s famous coffee shops to sell cannabis under strict guidelines.

* **Estonia**
* **Netherlands**
* **Slovenia**
* **Spain**

# Pharmaceutical Cannabinoid Drugs

Pharmaceutical cannabinoid drugs are entirely distinct from medical and adult-use marijuana products. Most countries that allow some form of legal cannabinoid products only allow pharmaceutical drugs made with THC, the compound known for getting people high, and CBD, a cannabinoid known for its medical benefits. (There are no legal joints to be found in this group.) In these countries, pharmaceutical products such as Sativex, which contains THC derived from Cannabis and dronabinol, synthetic THC, are legal only for people who get a prescription from a doctor.

* **Austria**
* **Belgium**
* **Croatia**
* **Finland**
* **Ireland**
* **Liechtenstein**
* **Poland**
* **San Marino**
* **Turkey**

# Illegal

Cannabis, for adult-use and medical purposes, is still illegal in most European countries. See below for a list of countries where cannabis remains an illegal drug.

* **Andorra**
* **Bulgaria**
* **Bosnia and Herzegovina**
* **Belarus**
* **Hungary**
* **Iceland**
* **Kosovo**
* **Lithuania**
* **Latvia**
* **Monaco**
* **Moldova**
* **Montenegro**
* **Serbia**
* **Slovakia**
* **Sweden**

1qrb5d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qrb5d5/fn_milly_the_ant_farmer_and_bob_the_ant/,[FN] Milly the Ant Farmer and Bob the Ant,"Milly was a beautiful woman that enjoyed her ant farms. She had all different kinds of them at her house. She even had one that was in the shape of a coffee table in the living room. It was made of two-way mirror material, so on the outside you could see into it, but on the inside (the ants) they could not see out.

There were millions of ants in her home, millions. Milly’s million ants some called them. Throughout the years she had really come to enjoy watching their civilizations advance. It was a bumpy road full of ups and downs, but for the most part the colonies flourished. Milly would even from time to time get involved with conflicts and big events within the colonies. Afterall, Milly, was their god.

The ants prayed to Milly too. There are temples and shrines all throughout the ant colonies that are built for her. There are billboards with Milly’s likeness on them… she is standing there with outstretched arms and open palms with kind eyes… as if she is giving a blessing perhaps.

In one of the ancillary ant farms in Milly’s basement, there lived an ant named Bob. Unbeknownst to Milly, Bob had been living in that ant farm for many years (decades even). This may sound innocuous, but it isn’t. Male ants typically don’t make it to a few months of age before death. Sure, some females, and especially the queens can live for decades… but not the males. Bob was special in this sense. Why didn’t Bob die like the other males he was born with? Instead, Bob has been around and witnessed dozens of life cycles around him.

This has fundamentally changed Bob from the ant he was born, into the *being* that he is now. Bob, does not call himself an ant because that isn’t what he is from his perspective. He has watched and observed ants up close all his life and male ants die quickly and he apparently does not, so he cannot be an ant. Bob has actually tested this a few times before by trying to self delete. He was unable to accomplish his goal, which both confused him and gave him confidence at the same time.

One day Milly goes down into the basement to get some supplies when Bob gets a revelation! Bob was staring at her walk down the stairs and go over to the closet when it hit him… *Milly doesn’t die either*. She is the only one that has persisted for his entire life. Even his own Queen ant has been replaced twice while he was alive. There are no ants alive today that were alive when he was born; they are all of them, new. Maybe he IS what Milly is?! Bob thinks to himself that he and Milly must be the same. This puts him down the path of fantasizing about her day after day. Bob eventually falls in love with Milly.

Now little did Bob know that Milly was telepathic. She could actually feel what it was that the ants were feeling, even with Bob. Not thinking in the mind, but feeling within their hearts. It is one of the ways that she has been such a good caretaker throughout the eons. She knows exactly what the entire colony wants and desires… that gives her the ability to balance all things when conflict arises. Yes this includes wiping out entire legions of ants that didn’t make the cut to play tomorrow. Mother Milly knows all, and is Right and Just to the colony.

A few months later Milly had to go back down to the basement, but this time Bob was in love instead of indifferent like last time. As soon as she entered the room, Bob was waiting for her and locked eyes as soon as she came in. This alerted Milly immediately due to her telepathy – she could feel admiration and love coming from somewhere. She thought someone had broken into her home and was watching her! She looked around and could not find an intruder… but the feeling of love persisted.

Soon she noticed where the feelings of love was coming from lol… it was an ant! She was flabbergasted as she had only ever really felt fear at this level of intensity from her ants. This intrigued her, so she walked over to the colony to get a closer look. At the top of the ant hill sits a solitary ant just staring at her. She locks eyes and just stares back. This goes on for almost a minute, which seems like an eternity for a quiet stare.

At this juncture she decides to move him to the main attraction ant colony that is within the living room coffee table. For Bob, this is an otherworldly experience and to him feels like he is being taken off world and put onto another planet.

He soon gets accustomed to his new life there and even gets a job and starts a family. Bob settles down with a nice ant named Lisa. Lisa is a classically attractive ant and is also a lot of fun to hang out with and do activities together.

Behind the two-way mirror of the walls of the coffee table colony, Milly can watch Bob raise his family and interact with Lisa without Bob knowing she is there because of the mirrored glass on Bobs end. She is so interested in him. Mother Milly has taken care of ants for a millennia and this is the first time that she has taken a direct interest in a **solitary ant** instead of the colony itself. Every time that Milly shows herself to Bob, he exudes love to her. Every time. Milly begins to enjoy this and get accustomed to it, almost expecting daily in order to remain balanced. On the days that she does not get these feelings from Bob; it will in fact throw her off balance.

Everyone knows where this is going… Milly begins to feel jealousy. She is jealous of Lisa, *the ant*. WTF?! This is a serious mindfuck for Milly. Milly is their god… why would she ever be jealous of Lisa?! Confused about this, she meditates for a few days on this topic to figure out what to do next.  

Since Milly can do whatever she wants, she decides to take over Lisa’s body for a little while. This will allow her to directly interact with Bob. She plans to do this while Bob is away at work.

Bob gets home from work and Lisa is standing at the door ready to greet him. A little odd for sure, but definitely welcome, he rushes over to hug her. It is in this moment that he can see, that it is not Lisa. You see, Bob is blind. His eyes work in the manner that they do show him the visible light that is entering his field of vision, but he is aware that all of that is fake or can be faked. Light waves are only a portion of what is real. The light waves that emanate from anything, is only ever showing the cover/outside of that thing. The light that enters our eyes will never ever show you what is underneath their exterior, **that, the interior, must be felt**.

To truly look and **see someone**, you must do it with your physical eyes closed. Then and only then will you be able to potentially see them. What does Bob see in this moment? Love, intrigue, curiosity, playfulness, excitement and a *little deception*. This, is not Lisa. Bob does not tell her he knows it is not her. He keeps this to himself and just lets it play out. Love her is what he wants to do.

Milly knows that Bob is a male ant and will likely die soon, so she wants to spend as much time with him as possible while he is still here. Which is why she took over Lisa’s little ant body so she could spend all her time with him instead of merely watching him. But as we know, Bob doesn’t die soon. This goes on for months and then years… Milly knows something is up but is just not quite sure what. Bob, knowing full well that he cannot die doesn’t really care and is instead falling in love with Lisa for the second time. This, is Lisa two, the second.

After a few years, Milly begins to seriously question why Bob has not yet died. At the same time, Bob knows that Lisa (the ant) should have also died at this point and instead, she looks even better than when they met, a smoking hot ant indeed. Bob begins to see Lisa as god. So, to Bob, Lisa **is Milly**. He begins to see her as god throughout his day to day endeavors and even treats her as such.

That is the thing with being a god when the ones around you are not god. Bob, does not understand what it is that Milly is doing all day. He does not understand the role that she plays for the entire colony. They all depend on her and she has to make extremely important decisions all the time that have lives at stake, even the future of the entire colony!

Because of this misunderstanding, Bob will at times infer some of Milly’s actions (while are entirely innocent from her perspective) are actually disrespectful to him… this begins to cause friction. Bob wants her to act one way instead of the way that she is acting. That itself is the fundament definition of suffering. **Wanting something to be any other way than the way that it actually is.**

Bob, filled with fear about what this implies, begins to scramble. Since he still sees Milly as Lisa from time to time, he begins to deal with this problem as an ant would. He smells her pheromones and inspects her antennae for signs of another ant… this does not go well for him. Milly knows what he is doing of course and tries to put his mind at ease. She does not want to harm him, but she must also do her duty to the colony. She is their god after all. They need her. Without her, balance will be lost and structure will cascade into chaos.

In a desperate attempt to get out of this circle of fear, Bob tries to scare Milly by insinuating to her that **he** is actually god, since he cannot die. Milly giggles to herself since she KNOWS that she is in fact the real god, not Bob lol.

Bob was imagining that he was catching Milly, but it turned out that he was the one that is actually **in Milly’s cage**.",1,1769792518.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

When I lost a lot of weight I was thinner and I got treated rly well doors held open to me, strangers offering to get me coffee at luxury places, people going out of their way to talk to me when shopping, receiving top treatment, guys actually hitting on me etc.. I gained back the weight because I have attachment trauma and I trusted people even less afterwards I broke down and I just wanted to be invisible. Now Im losing it again since food isn't really my problem but emotions are, it's easy to work with that. 

I notice when Im bigger I become more dysregulated. Im not obese at all, maybe 15kg overweight but short so it's a bit more noticeable. However it ruins my life, not because of health because I am very healthy I can walk and run for a long time without any issue, Im fit, but because of the way strangers treat me. They dont hold doors open as often, no guy pays attention to me so I feel ugly, I dont receive much compliments since gaining weight again, I am treated like Im less capable or invisible, people in public either look at me rudely or with less resepct (I do live in Europe). 

I also have social anxiety so I really struggle to connect with people. When I was thin my social deficiencies were brushed aside and seen as amazing but since gaining weight everything I do is judged negatively again and its not even that much weight where you'd think it would make suhc an effect so really I feel is it because I look bad in general or is it truly the weight, are people truly taht different to me because of 15kg????

I’ve done chalice dungeons a lot on almost all my saves, with my friends, and even invaded people in the chalice dungeons. I am bum with no shame. When I was going through chalice on my Edith save, it was like anyone other time with the same layouts and enemies. But their was one layer that I’ve been through so many times on my other saves and this time was almost exactly the same as any other time I’ve been through it except in a dark room there was a bloodlicker. Like I ran through this room like three times and I never knew there was a bloodlicker in there. I literally only found out about it because I thought I got everything in the chalice layer and I jumped down from the upper dark area into that lower dark area I’ve been through a few times.   
  
   AND OMG!!!!!! I saw a massive hand reach out behind my hunter and smack the shit out of my hunter’s ass. I fucking screamed sooo loud, like I was like ”AHHHHhHhHhHhhHh!!!!!!!!!!”. It was loud and that fucking bloodlicker scared the ever living shit out of me. I had half a pot of coffee in my system and my heart was beating so hard. I literally felt its beating hard in my chest for like ten minutes. I was panicking so hard that my hunter was like a fish out of water flopping on the floor with how much I was panic rolling. I did kill it but omg I had no idea that thing was there the whole time. Like omg wtfffffffff???!!!!! Like was it there for just that one save or has it always been there for every time I went through that particular chalice dungeon and I just never knew?

1qrb1mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaFe/comments/1qrb1mm/rightleaning_magalinked_businesses_in_santa_fe/,Right-Leaning MAGA-Linked Businesses in Santa Fe & Albuquerque,"Political leanings can influence where consumers choose to spend money. In the Santa Fe and Albuquerque area (generally liberal-leaning locales\[1\]), several businesses are owned by individuals with strong right-wing, pro-Trump (“MAGA”) affiliations. Below is a list of five local businesses tied to the MAGA movement, along with evidence of their political support and reasons a coordinated boycott could impact them.

**1. Flying Star Café (and Satellite Coffee) – Albuquerque**

Image: Flying Star’s owners were reportedly spotted wearing pro-Trump attire at one of their Albuquerque café locations.

MAGA Affiliation: Flying Star is a popular local café chain (with sister brand Satellite Coffee) owned by Jean and Mark Bernstein, who have been openly supportive of Donald Trump. In late 2022, patrons witnessed the Bernsteins at a Flying Star location wearing Trump-themed apparel – one of them even donned a “Jews For Trump” hat\[2\]. Multiple accounts on social media confirm seeing the owners sporting MAGA hats and expressing opposition to COVID-19 safety mandates\[3\]. This public display of support for Trump’s MAGA movement by the owners strongly ties the business to right-wing politics.

Boycott Impact: Flying Star’s customer base includes many students, professionals, and families in Albuquerque’s urban core – a demographic that leans Democratic. Indeed, Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) voted decisively against Trump in 2020\[1\]. News of the owners’ MAGA leanings sparked substantial local backlash; one Reddit thread about their Trump support garnered over 1,500 comments with many locals voicing intent to stop patronizing the café\[4\]. An organized boycott could be effective because Flying Star relies on a broad community reputation. If liberal and moderate customers “vote with their wallets” (as one organizer urged\[5\]) and take their coffee and dining business elsewhere, the chain would feel the loss. Flying Star operates in a competitive restaurant scene – customers can easily choose other coffee shops that better align with their values. The negative publicity alone – from viral social media discussions labeling the owners “vitriolic” and proudly MAGA\[3\] – suggests a sustained boycott could significantly erode the café’s sales and brand image.

**2. Frontier & Golden Pride Restaurants – Albuquerque**

MAGA Affiliation: Frontier Restaurant is a famed Albuquerque diner, and together with its four Golden Pride locations, it’s owned by Larry and Dorothy Rainosek. The Rainoseks have a long history of financially backing Republican and Trump-aligned candidates. Notably, Dorothy Rainosek donated $5,200 to GOP nominee Mark Ronchetti’s 2022 campaign for governor\[6\] – Ronchetti was endorsed by prominent Republicans and ran on a Trump-friendly platform. More recently, the Rainoseks contributed $5,000 to conservative mayoral candidate Darren White\[7\]. White actively embraced Trump-style “law and order” rhetoric, even promising to give federal immigration (ICE) agents greater latitude in Albuquerque\[8\]. The Rainoseks’ support for such candidates and causes firmly situates their businesses in the MAGA orbit. In addition, public donation records show Frontier’s owner giving thousands to the local Republican Party\[6\]. This pattern of political contributions is clear evidence that Frontier/Golden Pride’s owners are strong right-wing partisans, closely aligned with Trump-era Republican politics.

Boycott Impact: Frontier is an Albuquerque institution – a huge, popular eatery across from UNM, serving thousands of locals and students weekly\[9\]\[10\]. Golden Pride has a wide customer base for breakfast and lunch burritos citywide. Because Albuquerque’s population skews Democratic (the city’s counties all went for Biden by double digits\[1\]), many regular customers are likely to be unhappy funding a business whose profits may fuel Trumpist politics. An organized boycott could therefore hit the Rainoseks where it hurts: revenue. If university students, faculty, and other loyal patrons choose to eat elsewhere, Frontier’s famously long lines could thin out. The restaurant’s success depends on its broad appeal – a boycott would tarnish that appeal by associating the brand with divisive politics. Indeed, local commenters have already expressed dismay upon learning of the Rainoseks’ donations (e.g. “I need to quit the Frontier” sentiments on social media\[11\]\[12\]). With many alternative New Mexican eateries around, a sustained boycott driven by Albuquerque’s majority of non-MAGA residents could significantly dent Frontier/Golden Pride’s sales. In short, these businesses’ high community profile and diverse customer mix make them susceptible to economic pressure if large numbers of locals withdraw their support.

**3. Weck’s Breakfast & Lunch – Santa Fe & Albuquerque**

MAGA Affiliation: Weck’s is a New Mexico homegrown chain of breakfast/lunch diners. Political ties have emerged both in its Santa Fe franchise and among the Albuquerque-based founders. In Santa Fe, the owner of the local Weck’s is described by multiple sources as a “huge MAGA\[t\]” – an extremely hardcore Trump supporter\[13\]\[14\]. Employees and customers have noted that this franchisee flaunted anti-lockdown and right-wing positions (for example, refusing to comply with COVID shutdowns in 2020) and even tolerated extremist groups (reports surfaced that Proud Boys protesters were once welcomed on-site during the pandemic)\[15\]\[16\]. Meanwhile, the original Weck’s founders in Albuquerque (Art and Toya Kaplan) also lean Trump-ward. They were major donors in recent local elections – giving $6,000 to the above-mentioned Darren White campaign for mayor\[12\]. (White’s platform on immigration mirrored Trump’s hardline stance, so this donation aligns the Kaplans with Trump-style policies.) In addition, a community member noted that Weck’s Albuquerque owners donated to Trump’s 2020 campaign via the GOP WinRed platform\[17\]. This claim is backed by federal records – for example, a Weck’s executive’s name appears in FEC reports of Trump fundraising\[12\]. Together, these facts paint Weck’s as a chain led by openly MAGA-aligned individuals both at the franchise level and corporately.

Boycott Impact: Weck’s restaurants thrive on a family-friendly reputation and attract a wide swath of New Mexicans for hearty breakfasts. Organizing a boycott could be effective because patrons have plenty of alternatives (other local diners or national chains) for their pancake and burrito fix. If progressives in Santa Fe and Albuquerque publicize the owners’ political ties, it could turn off a significant portion of the customer base. Notably, when Santa Fe locals discovered their Weck’s owner’s politics, some vowed never to return\[18\]\[19\]. The Albuquerque Weck’s locations, which had tried to distance themselves from the Santa Fe controversy, nonetheless face scrutiny now for the owners’ Trump donations\[17\]. Given that both cities are overwhelmingly blue (Santa Fe County gave Biden over 70% of its vote\[1\]), a boycott resonates with local values. The effectiveness is magnified by Weck’s dependence on its local image – a concerted campaign (e.g. spreading the word on social media, local forums) could significantly reduce foot traffic. In summary, Weck’s stands to lose many moderate and liberal customers if an organized boycott brings greater awareness to the owners’ MAGA sympathies, thereby harming the chain’s bottom line.

**4. Just Sprinklers (Landscaping/Irrigation) – Albuquerque**

MAGA Affiliation: Just Sprinklers is a landscaping and irrigation supply business in Albuquerque whose ownership has shown explicit support for Trump’s movement. In fact, Michelle Seaver – listed as the owner of Just Sprinklers – donated $1,000 to WinRed on Sept 30, 2020\[20\]. WinRed is the Republican fundraising platform used by Donald Trump’s campaign, indicating that this contribution directly helped Trump and GOP causes. This public donation aligns the business owner with the MAGA camp financially. Additionally, local activists have flagged Just Sprinklers as a “MAGA-supporting” establishment on forums that track such businesses\[21\]. The company has also been associated with conservative community events (for instance, partnering on charity drives with organizations friendly to right-wing media\[22\]). All evidence considered, the owners of Just Sprinklers are clearly right-leaning and politically active in support of Trump.

Boycott Impact: Just Sprinklers serves a broad customer base of homeowners, gardeners, and contractors in the Albuquerque area. Many of these customers likely do not share the owner’s far-right views. If made aware of the owner’s MAGA ties, a chunk of them could take their business to one of the many competing irrigation and garden suppliers. A boycott campaign against Just Sprinklers could leverage the fact that alternative providers exist (both big-box stores and other locals without political baggage). The company’s dependence on local clientele makes it vulnerable: for example, loss of a few large landscaping clients or dozens of retail customers would directly hurt revenue. Community organizers already monitoring MAGA-linked businesses have specifically called out Just Sprinklers, suggesting a boycott is feasible and could gain traction\[21\]. Also, Albuquerque’s consumer market leans liberal; organized pressure (through boycott pledges, negative reviews citing the owner’s politics, etc.) could push the business into an unwelcome spotlight. In short, Just Sprinklers is susceptible to an economic boycott because it operates in a competitive sector where customers can easily switch, and its owner’s open support for Trump provides clear motivation for opponents to rally others to avoid the company.

**5. Beck & Bulow Butcher Shop – Santa Fe**

MAGA Affiliation: Beck & Bulow is an upscale butcher and wild game meat shop in Santa Fe. While the owners (Tony Beck and John-Paul Bulow) keep a foodie-focused public image, they have implicitly aligned with the MAGA movement by affiliating with “anti-woke” business networks. Notably, Beck & Bulow is listed on PublicSq (Public Square)\[23\] – a national online marketplace explicitly for conservative, pro-Trump businesses. (PublicSq markets itself as an anti-“woke” platform supportive of conservative and anti-abortion values\[23\].) Businesses must opt in and affirm those values to be featured\[24\], so Beck & Bulow’s presence there signals that its owners ideologically side with Trump-friendly, right-wing stances. Furthermore, the shop’s branding and partnerships hint at their politics: they proudly advertise acceptance of cryptocurrency (a trend among libertarian/conservative circles) and collaborate with organizations like the NRA’s Hunters’ Leadership forums. While the owners may not tweet political slogans, their participation in a MAGA-oriented business directory and the ethos they project (“God, Family, Country” style marketing) firmly place Beck & Bulow in the right-wing camp.

Boycott Impact: In Santa Fe’s progressive community, a high-end butcher deemed politically far-right could face a significant backlash. Beck & Bulow relies on local patrons for its specialty meats (as well as online customers), and many of those patrons are Santa Fe residents who strongly oppose Trump. If an organized boycott highlighted the shop’s PublicSq affiliation and values, social pressure could discourage Santa Fe’s restaurants and residents from buying there. Customers can obtain meat from neutral sources (other local butchers, farmers’ markets, or supermarkets), so a boycott is practical. The effectiveness would come from Santa Fe’s tight-knit networks: word-of-mouth travels fast, and a coordinated stance (for example, Santa Fe locals pledging not to support businesses on the PublicSq “patriotic” list) could isolate Beck & Bulow. Additionally, losing local restaurant accounts or holiday orders due to a reputation for extremism would directly hit revenue. Given Santa Fe’s identity as a tolerant, blue stronghold, a publicized boycott would also put reputational pressure on Beck & Bulow to reconsider its affiliations. In summary, Beck & Bulow’s niche market position and the availability of alternatives mean a sustained boycott by Santa Fe’s majority could substantially impact them, both financially and image-wise.

Sources: The above assessments are supported by public records and reporting. For instance, campaign finance databases confirm donations by these business owners to Trump-aligned entities\[20\]\[7\], and local journalism and community posts document the owners’ political displays and community reactions\[25\]\[3\]. Community discussions (e.g. Albuquerque and Santa Fe online forums) have actively identified these businesses as supporting the MAGA agenda and discussed boycotts\[5\]\[13\]. All evidence indicates that these five businesses are run by strongly right-wing, pro-Trump individuals and that an organized economic boycott – given the local demographic dynamics – could be an effective form of protest.

Heartbreak and happiness, letdowns and adventures, visiting loves ones and being alone. I got a new job, made new friends and lost old ones. Somehow, somewhere though, something feels a little amiss - I miss having someone to share everyday with. If that's you too, well maybe we can hit it off and see where it goes? 😊

Anyway, a little about me - I'd describe myself as open, endlessly curious, a little dorky (in the cute way, ofc), and occassionally very funny™ if you're a fan of dad jokes / puns. I'm always reading about or learning something new, and I love conversations that push each other to think differently or see new perspectives. 

I used to watch a ton of TV and movies, and I still try to keep up when I can - I watch pretty much anything and always looking for recommendations. Also, if you haven't seen the show Ted Lasso you should stop and go watch now. I'll wait. Happy times await you! Book recommendations are also welcome - I reallly want to get back into reading as many books as I did as a kid. I love some science fiction, but I'll read anything interesting too!

Okay, let's see, hobbies? Oh god I have too many to list. I sometimes feel like I'm on an endless rotation between new and possibly pointless hobbies that I get into for a while and then completely abandon. Do I enjoy puzzles? You bet I do. Magic Tricks? Pick a card. Juggling? Actually no I hit my face with the ball and then stopped, but anyway. Photography? Been there snapped that. Am I particularly good at any of these? well, I'll let you judge. If you've got a hobby you want to share with someone (or just want to learn something random together) you should most definitely count me in!

Who am I looking for?

I don't particularly care about the person's ethnicity or looks, but I am looking for someone that's compatible intellectually, emotionally and where we're both genuinely share a connection.

I'm generally low-energy after work and life, and want someone who can appreciate the downtime with me. I can be great in - and do want - social/outdoor activities occassionally, but I do find that they tend to drain me more than energize me. My idea of a perfect time together is cozy nights in after long days, lazy mornings on weekends. Putting on some soothing music and talking into the night about everything and nothing, the meaning of life and stupid jokes we heard during the day. Being able to feel like home around each other, and comfortable silence. Holding hands, playing with each others hair, cuddling, maybe a terrible movie on we can both laugh at.

I like to think of myself as honest and straightforward, and also get along best with people who are the same. I don't like games or mixed signals and prefer being upfront about wants / preferences and thoughts. You'll always know where you're at with me without second guessing. If I'm excited to be with you, I'll show it and if not, I'll do you the courtesy of letting you know instead of leading you on.

I work in tech and I'm very passionate about what I do, and love talking about it. I don't expect you to be in / familiar with any of it, but I want someone who's curious and wants to sit down with me to really understand about each other's lives. I feel like when something is such a big part of our lives, that's something you definitely need to be able to share with someone in some capacity. Even outside of work, please be someone who actually likes conversations and wants to share your days!


Anyway, that's all from me, if you're still around, and you think we'd get along, DM me with your best/favorite pun and a little bit about you? It's so hard starting a conversation when I've got nothing to go off except a ""hi"".

Kush Mints: A Refreshing Blend of Minty Coolness and Relaxing Bliss

FLAVOR/AROMA – Mint

Kush Mints, also known as ""Kush Mintz,"" is a hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Animal Mints with Bubba Kush. The result is a high THC strain with a unique minty taste. Kush Mints provides effects that are uplifting and happy. This strain has a complex flavor profile that tastes like mint and cookies. Growers say Kush Mints grows best when indoors and done hydroponically. Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help stimulate appetite.

A flavorful bud crafted by Seed Junky Genetics, this hybrid strain pulls evenly from her Bubba Kush and Animal Mints lineage. Although an average THC level of 23% doesn’t sound like much, many note that Kush Mints packs a punch. When you’re ready to let the cares of the day slip away, consider giving this gal a try. Her nugs are fluffy and deep green, featuring a thick layer of frosty white crystals. As if her name didn’t already give it away, this bud is rich in crisp mint flavor but, surprisingly enough, incorporates notes of earth, coffee, and cookies into the mix as well. Her aroma is similar in nature, making her a preferred dessert strain for many.

We were college sweethearts. Somewhere after college we parted ways because we had different career paths. Timing wasn’t on our side.

Eventually, after several years, we met each other in a coffee shop. Fortunately we’re both still single so we exchanged numbers and the rest is history.

We learned a lot about each other. After several months, we decided to move in together to see if things would really work out between us. Soon enough, I got pregnant.

A while back, one of my friends got me a job at her work.  This was a drive through coffee stand where the workers wore bikinis mostly.   I worked as the cashier/customer server not so much the barista.   We wore bikinis much like you would at the beach.   The job itself was really fun and the girls I worked with were great.  Most of us were in college just working to make money during school.  

  
The part I regret is some of the things we did and what happened because of it.  No need for me to say that the customers were very friendly and flirty, but in a respectful way.  I mean, we girls in bikinis serving coffee and such was very nice for the men that came through I'm sure.   But like I said, most were very polite and respectful yet playfully flirty.  

  
The problem came when some of the girls took it a bit too far and suckered me into doing the same.   Occasionally we would flash certain customers.  Of course this led to better tips.  It even led to sometimes us working topless for a bit and showing ourselves off.  The reason I regret this is because some, not all, in fact a small percentage of the customers got very disrespectful and plain rude.  But in a very bad way.  Some of the comments that were made were extremely nsfw and disrespectful to us girls.

The culprit was a bleed in a fist-sized clump of neurons tucked down in the back and bottom of her brain called the Cerebellum. A couple weeks later, her doctors took a piece of it out, assuring her it just did basic motor control - she might be a bit clumsy for a while, but she’d still be herself. But after that surgery Rachel did not feel quite like herself. So she dove into the dusty basement of the brain (and brain science)&nbsp; to figure out why. What Rachel found was a new frontier in neuroscience. We learn what singing Shakira on stage has to do with reaching for a cup of coffee&nbsp; — and why the surprising relationship between those two things means we may need to rethink what we think about thinking.

1qraplk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1qraplk/struggling_after_seeing_the_puer_video/,Struggling after seeing the Puer video.,"Hello, I'm a married guy (28) to my wife (30). We've been together for 2 years and a half now. My wife has ADHD and she's been doing a lot of research for self-improvement and reading books (Miracle Morning to say one) , watching videos (Dr.K's videos amongst others). She's also been going to therapy for almost a year now. 

  
Now, regarding myself, I also go to therapy, for about a year now. I don't have any diagnosed conditions but I did have very depressive states (not washing myself, isolating myself, not caring of my body and mind at all, pushing people away). I am much better now but I've been struggling with my relationship for a while now.

  
In short, my wife showed me the Puer video and I really do think I have a lot of those behaviour and that they're very strong, it also explains how me and my wife can be similar when we are at our worst because she's also a Puella.  
We got into an arguement that has been one of the main problems of our relationship and that's chores and/or responsabilities. 

I think it's also important to understand the dynamic on how we clean the house. When I go to uni I take care of the dishes, loading and unloading of the dishwasher basically, I give food to the cats in the evening and I try to take care of all the bills and bs bureaucracy of the townhalls taxes etc.  
Everything else is on her, from cooking (90%) to cleaning to taking care of the cats and groceries. Now I'm on a break so we're trying to have it more balanced even though I'm not doing too well at that.

Today I woke up, feeling great, fed the cats, brewed a coffee and then instead of listening to the Puer saying (just drink the coffee then take a shower) wich would have eventually led me to my desk and not taking a shower, I just took a shower and started the day differently. Then I sat down my desk and enjoyed my coffee. I played a couple of games of Dota with a friend of mine and around 11:30 am my wife asks me if we can clean the house, just after coming back home from throwing away the pet bottles and buying trash bags. I started basically screeching because I've been avoiding this since my break from uni started the 26th. Normally I could bring myself to do it but today I had 0 intent to do so, but she insisted. I wanted to play one more game with a friend but I just caved in and said that I will help clean. 

  
In the end, what was supposed to be a deep clean of the house turned out to be, organizing (not so greatly) the folders of bills and similar documents and vaccuuming the house, that's what I did. 

She cleaned the restroom, bleach and all removed the limestone residue from all surfaces, did the clothes, folded them and mopped a section of the house. She said that I'm not helping her since she also doesn't want to do it but she says we have to do because we can't live in a messy enviroment (unfolded clothes on the sofa, dirty kitchen counter, socks on the floor, random clutter on tables).  
FYI, the house is around 90 square/metres and it's just a big entrance/living room/kitchen with a toilet and bedroom, the house was also very dirty compared to what we usually tolerate.  
I don't think that we have to stress ourselves so much to keep the house squeaky clean, spotless. It acknowledge the fact that it's better to live in a clean house. It's just I can't bring myself to do so.  
What made me pop was that I felt emotionally forced to say yes otherwise she would have been mad at me, because if I'm not motivated enough to do something she won't and if she doesn't do it she will feel bad about it because she's trying to be a better person.

I on the other hand don't mind that much about chores...

My question is if this is my Puer speaking, just letting the house get gradually more and more dirty till I can't stand it anymore then clean it or if it's normal or some other type of issue.  
My wife feels desperate to help me be better as well but I'm telling her to not try to force me to do something because it will have the opposite effect, I will become bitter, annoyed and frustrated and that mental state will lead me into things I don't want to do (shout, scream, be unpleasant) and I don't want to say (being offensive, petty, self-depricating).   
Again, is this my Puer taking over? I say to her ""don't force me"" so that way I don't have to do the chores? Any advice would be helpful.

TLDR:  
I'm pretty sure I'm a Puer and I keep fighting with my wife over chores because my Puer takes over but I'm not 100% sure it is because of that. I don't want to do chores, my wife tries to force me to do so because she wants to help me, causes backlash. What should I do?",3,1769791594.0,Healthygamergg,0,0.71,False

I picked it up in LA and drove it back to the SF Bay Area. Thanks to everyone for [advice on road tripping it back](https://www.reddit.com/r/etron/s/8XoKYVRmNn). Sorry this post is kinda long:  
  
I was originally planning to drive up the coast, but I ran out of time and decided to haul up I-5 instead. I stopped 3 times to charge because I personally needed a break, but I could have reduced it to two if I hadn’t drank so much coffee before hitting the road. I subscribed to 1 month of Tesla membership and used Tesla charging exclusively. I’ve used EA before, and it often works fine, but I didn’t want to deal with waiting if any particular stop got busy, and Tesla stops had so many more handles. Normally, I just charge at home 95% of the time. The range is around 212-218 miles at 100%, which is fine for me. I like to stop every 3 or so hours and take a break, and it charges fast enough.

I bought it from a dealership, did the paperwork remotely, and picked it up without ever having driven it or any SQ8 etron. I did have a friend drive it for me to make sure it was in good shape, but I was completely unprepared for how amazing it was to drive! I know driving EVs fast tanks the range, but wow this thing likes to GO. Seriously, it's difficult to put into words how it drives like a dream. 

A note about the tech: the dealership helped me get setup as the Key user in the MMI and the app. Once I got home, I figured out how to get my other family members set up as authorized users in the MMI and their own respective apps. It seems to be working well, but I'll wait to see if it bugs out over time. I can write up how I did it if anybody is struggling with this.

Everyone around me, myself included, was doing everything WRONG. Like we've been fed this bullshit about looks being everything, or just ""be confident bro"" without anyone explaining what the hell that actually means.

Here's what nobody tells you: attraction isn't really about you being hot. It's about how you make people FEEL. Sounds cheesy but hear me out because the psychology behind this is actually insane.

I compiled everything from the best sources I could find. No recycled pickup artist garbage. Actual science, actual human behavior insights. This changed how I see literally everything.

**1. master the energy you bring into every room**

Most people walk around like apologetic ghosts. Low energy, hunched shoulders, avoiding eye contact like they're hiding from the IRS. That's not a vibe anyone wants to be around.

Read ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane. She coached executives at Stanford and breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors. The book won multiple awards and honestly, this is the best charisma book I've ever read. It'll make you question everything you think you know about presence. The core idea is that charisma comes from three things: presence, power, and warmth. You can literally practice these.

Practical tip: when talking to someone, actually BE there. Put your phone away, make eye contact, focus on what they're saying instead of planning your next witty comment. People can sense when you're mentally checked out. It's like a sixth sense thing.

**2. become obsessed with being interesting instead of being liked**

This is huge. Most people try so hard to be agreeable that they become boring as hell. They have no opinions, no passions, nothing that makes them stand out. You're not trying to be everyone's cup of tea, you're trying to be someone's EXACT flavor.

Develop actual skills and knowledge. Take salsa classes, learn about philosophy, get into specialty coffee, start rock climbing, whatever. Just have SOMETHING you're genuinely into. Passion is magnetic. Boredom is repulsive.

There's this app called Ash that's actually pretty solid for working on social anxiety and relationship skills. It's like having a pocket therapist who helps you process why you dim yourself around others. Been using it for a few months and the coaching is surprisingly good.

**3. fix your body language before you do anything else**

Your body is constantly broadcasting signals. Most people broadcast ""please don't hurt me"" or ""i'm tired of existing."" Neither is attractive.

Watch Vanessa Van Edwards' YouTube channel (especially her videos on body language). She runs a human behavior research lab and breaks down micro expressions, power poses, all that stuff. Her content is backed by actual studies, not just opinions.

Stand up straight but not rigid. Take up space. Move deliberately instead of fidgeting. Smile with your eyes, not just your mouth (a real smile engages the muscles around your eyes, fake ones don't). When you're walking somewhere, walk like you're going somewhere important, not shuffling around aimlessly.

**4. develop emotional intelligence or stay mediocre forever**

You know what's wildly attractive? Someone who can read a room, pick up on subtle emotional cues, and respond appropriately. Someone who doesn't make everything awkward.

""Emotional Intelligence 2.0"" by Travis Bradberry is mandatory reading here. It's a Wall Street Journal bestseller that includes an actual assessment to measure your EQ. This book made me realize how emotionally illiterate I was. It teaches you to recognize your own emotions, manage them, and understand others' emotions too.

Practice this: when someone tells you something, try to identify the emotion behind it before responding. If your friend says ""work was fine I guess,"" they're probably not fine. Ask a follow up question instead of moving on.

**5. stop seeking validation like a starving animal**

Desperation smells worse than actual body odor. When you NEED people to like you, to find you attractive, to validate your existence, it leaks out of every interaction. It's suffocating.

Work on your self worth independently from others. Use an app like Finch for daily habit building and self care routines. It's gamified so you're basically building yourself up through small wins. Sounds dumb but it works.

The goal is to get to a place where you WANT connection but don't NEED it. Where someone's rejection doesn't shatter you because you're already solid on your own. That security is what makes people want to be around you.

**6. learn the art of creating sexual tension without being creepy**

There's a difference between being flirty and being a weird creep. The difference is calibration and respect for boundaries.

Listen to the ""Art of Charm"" podcast, specifically their episodes on attraction and social dynamics. The hosts interview psychologists, dating coaches, relationship experts. It's not pickup artist nonsense, it's actual behavioral science.

Sexual tension comes from: eye contact that lasts a beat longer than normal, playful teasing (not mean, PLAYFUL), light touching when appropriate (shoulder, arm, not weird places), being comfortable with silence, and having the confidence to show interest without being needy about the outcome.

**7. smell good and dress like you give a shit**

This seems obvious but most people fail here spectacularly. You don't need to be conventionally hot. You need to be well groomed and dressed intentionally.

Get a decent haircut regularly. Figure out what clothes actually fit your body (not too tight, not too baggy). Invest in ONE good cologne or perfume, don't bathe in it. Take care of your skin. Trim your nails. Basic hygiene isn't optional.

If you're clueless about style, spend an afternoon on reddit's malefashionadvice or femalefashionadvice. They have starter guides that are actually helpful.

**8. become a better storyteller**

Attractive people know how to tell stories that hook you in. They're not reciting their day like a grocery list.

""The Storytelling Animal"" by Jonathan Gottschall is insanely good for understanding why stories captivate us. He's a professor who studied literature and evolution, and this book explores how storytelling is wired into human nature.

Practice telling stories with a structure: set the scene, build tension, deliver a punchline or resolution. Cut unnecessary details. Use vocal variety. Paint pictures with your words. People remember how you made them feel, and good stories create feelings.

If you want something more personalized to build these skills into daily habits, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's a smart learning app that creates customized podcasts from books like The Charisma Myth, relationship psychology research, and expert talks on social dynamics. You can set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan with episodes tailored to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. You can also chat with the virtual coach Freedia about your specific struggles in dating or social situations, and it'll recommend content that actually fits your situation. Plus you can customize the voice (some people swear by the smoky, sarcastic narrator for making dry psychology easier to absorb). Makes consistent self-improvement way less of a chore when you're commuting or at the gym.

**9. stop caring what everyone thinks (but care what the right people think)**

You can't be attractive to everyone. Trying to be universally liked is a guaranteed way to be universally boring. Some people won't vibe with you no matter what you do, and that's perfectly fine.

Focus on being authentic and let the right people find you. The ones who appreciate your weird humor, your specific interests, your personality quirks. Those are your people.

**10. prioritize your mental health like your life depends on it**

You can't fake being mentally healthy. Anxiety, depression, unresolved trauma, they all leak into your interactions and make genuine connection difficult.

Therapy isn't just for people who are ""broken."" Everyone has shit to work through. If traditional therapy isn't accessible, apps like Insight Timer have thousands of guided meditations for specific issues (anxiety, self esteem, sleep, whatever).

Work on yourself not to become attractive, but because you deserve to feel good. The attraction thing is just a side effect of being a healthier, more grounded person.

Look, attraction isn't some mysterious force. It's psychology and effort and genuine self improvement. You're not going to transform overnight. But if you actually implement this stuff consistently, you'll notice shifts. People will respond to you differently. You'll feel different about yourself.

The weirdest part is that once you stop obsessing over being attractive and start focusing on becoming a better version of yourself, that's when people actually start noticing you. Funny how that works.",1,1769791329.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

A five man work crew stayed for two nights at my rental. The booker had all five star reviews and we regularly host work crews without issue (other than dudes are messy). When my cleaner entered the home she found marijuana shake and small brown powder crumbles on the coffee tables, on top of bedroom dressers, and on the kitchen counters.

The marijuana was obviously marijuana,  and weed doesn’t worry me. The brown powdery crumbles could be a number of different, dangerous things.  It is beyond negligent to leave behind hard drugs for someone else to clean up and be exposed to.

The cleaner, a dear gem, gloved up and deep cleaned the house. She was so worried that she maybe missed something that she came back the next day of her own accord and wiped everything down a second time, re-swept and mopped because she knew my next set of guests is a family with children.

The issue is that she didn’t take any pictures. I want to have these guests banned from the app, but I have no way to prove that they left drugs everywhere.

So here are my questions.

1) If I leave an honest review, do you think the guests will be able to have it removed since it’s my word against theirs?

2) Do you think Airbnb will remove them if I report the issue without proof?

I’m organizing a coffee + music sundowner in Nagpur focused on a young, lifestyle-driven crowd (students & working professionals).

Instead of charging for stalls, I want to collaborate with small local brands (coffee, desserts, fashion, skincare, art, accessories, etc.) by offering them:

• A physical spot at the venue
• Direct interaction with potential customers
• Brand visibility in a relaxed, non-salesy environment
• Content opportunities (photos/videos with crowd)
• PR from my side during the event (introductions, brand mentions, and on-ground promotion)

This is not a flea market, it’s a curated experience event, so I’ll be taking limited brands only to avoid overcrowding.

If you’re a:
– Homegrown brand
– Side hustle
– Or testing a new product

and want real customer exposure without high marketing spend, comment or DM and I’ll share details.

I tried some supplements, excercise, yellow light to help sleep etc. They're all good for general well being but none gave me the endurance to push through my job without getting burned out by day end.

I tried coffee, and it slightly helped. But it barely helped me to get to half day. I still get fairly burned out by day end. Energy drinks are even weaker since where I live they are restricted to only have coffee like caffeine concentrations.

I initially had a bad perception of caffeine as a toxic substance. But because of my need I decided to try a pill. So I took a pill of 200mg. Oh. My. God, I was like holy f\*\*\* so THIS is what caffeine feels like. First 4 hours went by without me even knowing, I was in zen. The rest was not as good but by end of day I was only mildly tired and felt I still have gas left in me.

At first hour I got a slight jitter feeling but nothing worth noticing. I also took 200mg of theanine to smooth it out. I never knew caffeine can HIT you like THIS - I always thought it's a small unnoticeable wakefullness. I was in perfect flo state until like first half life and was productive for like 6 hrs. Also there is not much euphoria or confusion so you won't look like a junkie to others and there is little to no addiction. Even after repeated use daily it gave me like 80% of initial boost.

Obviously being able to activate flo state on will in alluring, but there is no actual physical addiction. If you stop, you might feel tired, miss the flo, but if you don't want it right now then you can just not. Caffeine is literally a magic pill for me.

1qraelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamingFrench/comments/1qraelz/150_300_hour_update/,150 (+300) Hour Update!,"Bonjour à toutes et à tous !

I've officially reached 450 hours of French comprehensible input (I discuss how I'm counting my hours below)!  

I have been a lurker on this sub and on Dreaming Spanish's sub since sometime in 2024 and am finally jumping into the fun!  I lurked for so long because I thought the community support was so impressive and such a good way to stay motivated to learn.  I'm inspired by the broader Dreaming community's progress updates and resource recommendations.  I'm excited to officially join the Dreaming French community here to hold myself accountable, stay motivated, and help others as we all work towards our language acquisition goals.  And I wanted to make this post in case it helps anyone else on this sub feel like joining, even though they aren't a purist.  

**Background:**  In short, I'm not starting from zero, so I'm not a purist (but hope to be one day with Spanish!).  

* **Pre-2023:**  I learned French in middle school and high school, eventually taking AP French in 2010/2011, but hard stopped language learning at that point.
* **2023-2024:**  I picked up French again over a decade later in December 2023 when I started... you guessed it!  Duolingo.  I spent the next few months into 2024 blasting through the CEFR A1 and A2 content, then my wife and I had a baby(!), which slowed my progress for most of the rest of the year.  I nonetheless continued Duolingo and listened to the first two seasons of Coffee Break French, which I don't count as input, but was a really helpful refresher.
* **2025:**  I quickly realized the enormous value in comprehensible input that I knew would elevate my language learning journey and, as I advanced, allow for more passive learning/acquisition.  I'm big into goal-setting, so I reset some goals for 2025 and wanted to focus on comprehensible input and reading.  Inspired by Dreaming Spanish, I kept track of most of it:
   * Over the course of the year, I finished the entire Duolingo content tree for French through CEFR B1 and B2.  (I honestly learned/refreshed a ton on Duolingo, but the progress slowed into the B2 content.)
   * I worked through the Easy French Step-by-Step workbook/textbook.  
   * I listened to season three of Coffee Break French (maybe comprehensible input, but still not counting it).
   * I read roughly 129,500 words from graded readers and short stories.
   * I listened to 120 hours of comprehensible input.  For the most part, this included:
      * French Comprehensible Input (FCI) A2 series as well as most of the Tintin L'Île Noire series;
      * LanguaTalk Slow French;
      * Little Talk in Slow French; and
      * the first 20 episodes of InnerFrench (after which it became too difficult).  

**High Point/Low Point:**

* The high point for me over the last 150 hours of input was recently having the FCI Tintin L'Île Noire series feel almost completely comprehensible and extremely easy to listen to.  Another point was being able to do chores while listening to Little Talk in Slow French.  (Lucas and Nagisa are GOATs.)  
* The low point was having to stop InnerFrench earlier last year because the episodes were becoming too difficult to comprehend.  It was defeating and I lost a lot of motivation (and hours) because of it, but it made me realize I need more input more often than I was getting.  I'm excited to jump back into InnerFrench this year (Hugo is also a GOAT).

**Rationale for Hours:**  I'm counting myself at 450 hours total, which includes the 150 hours of recorded comprehensible input plus a 300-hour credit/bump for the more traditional learning methods I followed before.  This is a personal journey after all, so I think all approaches to counting hours are valid as long as you find meaning and motivation in it.  For me, it felt disingenuous to start at zero hours and then post updates that clearly illustrated I was past whatever corresponding level.  Additionally, for purposes of leveling, I think I align most closely with the descriptions of Level 4 and Level 5.  So, 450 hours at mid-Level 4 seems right for me!  And it will be more motivating for me to start with some credit versus none for the work I've already done.

**Current Input:**

* **Listening:**  I'm currently watching/listening to FCI's Asterix series and DF.  As far as podcasts, I'm listening to InnerFrench and new episodes of Little Talk in Slow French.  At this point, I can listen to these while driving (easiest), running/walking (a little harder), and even doing chores (harder).
* **Reading:**  I'm currently reading the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  It's slow but I'm getting faster.

**2026 Goals:**

* **Listening:**  300+ more hours.
   * Finish FCI's Asterix series and the Tintin en Amérique series;  
   * From FCI, move on to Français Authentique's videos and keep up with DF videos;
   * Continue InnerFrench;
   * Start other podcasts like Passerelles, French with Panache, Nota Bene, etc.; and
   * Listen to RFI's Journal en Français on weekdays (to build out my global news vocabulary).
* **Reading:**  200,000+ more words.
   * Finish the first Percy Jackson book.
   * Start/finish the first Harry Potter book (to determine which series to read from).
* **Speaking:**  Maybe start conversations on iTalki (or similar app), but will likely save that for next year.

Oh, and my wife and I are expecting a second baby in July, so that will slow things down again!  But I feel like my comprehension is already in such a better place that I hope I can get hours in even more passively by then.

If you made it to the end of this post, thanks!  Let me know if you have thoughts or recommendations based on the above!  And keep going and enjoy the long ride!",15,1769790946.0,DreamingFrench,8,1.0,False

 Manage sessions with structured notes and instant links

 Create bestiaries, encounters, items, and spell cards

 Run combat smoothly with clear trackers

 Organize players and NPCs in one place

 Keep everything stored locally, private, and under your control

 It’s 100% free to use.

No subscriptions. No locked features. No hidden paywalls.

That said—this project is fueled by passion, time, and way too much coffee 

If you enjoy the tool and find it useful, buying me a coffee from time to time is an enormous help and keeps development going. Totally optional, but deeply appreciated.

If you’re a Game Master who loves worldbuilding, organization, and running smoother sessions, I’d love for you to give it a try and share your feedback.

I know others have also sent you emails. I hope you take time to read them all in their entirety.

My name is ringpopcosmonaut, I am a longtime resident of \[NEIGHBORHOOD\] and patron of\[YOUR BUSINESS\]. \[ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT MY HISTORY/RELATIONSHIP WITH SAID BUSINESS\]

I saw your statement on instagram regarding how you plan to deal with federal agents in your shops. I am hurt and disappointed to say the least. You say you value community and “embrace people of different backgrounds, race, ethnicity, and beliefs.” You even acknowledge that ICE is not in fact keeping anybody safe, rather that they are “instilling fear across our communities.” Yet your statement ends declaring you will serve them when they come to your shops — so long as they do so “peacefully.” Why? Do you not see the contradiction?

We know, indisputably, that ICE is not anywhere “peacefully.” They are on a mission to enforce civil, not criminal, law (i.e. paperwork violations), and have been doing so as violently as possible. In two weeks they have publicly executed two US citizens in broad daylight. Their very presence in any community is threatening and violent. Acting civilly while buying coffee does not make them “peaceful,” as you suggest. 

If you choose to serve ICE agents, who will feel safe and comfortable at your shops? I do understand that doing the right thing is scary, and it may even open you up to being targeted. But by refusing ICE agents you will be joining a growing list of local businesses and organizations who are also resisting. And in turn you will galvanize other shops to get brave and join the effort too. This ultimately will create a stronger resistance against the fascists, who are actively terrorizing the community for which you care so deeply.

Your response to your employees’ and communities’ ICE concerns is unacceptable. ICE is due to be in Columbus in just a few days. I’d like to see an official update from you stating you will refuse service to anyone in your any of your stores who appears or claims to be with ICE or any related operation, along with an action plan detailing how you will enforce this, and a formal apology to the community you have been cultivating since 1989. I want to see it by next Friday 2/6/2026. If you’re not interested, that’s your decision. But I, and my friends, neighbors, coworkers, and family, will no longer be part of your so-called “community.” We will spend our time and money at establishments that do refuse to serve ICE, and that demonstrate they care for their communities more than their bottom line. And I will do my part to inform as many people as possible that Staufs is not a safe place for them to go.

I look forward to your response.",0,1769790815.0,Columbus,38,0.4,False

I’m organizing a coffee + music sundowner in Nagpur focused on a young, lifestyle-driven crowd (students & working professionals).

Instead of charging for stalls, I want to collaborate with small local brands (coffee, desserts, fashion, skincare, art, accessories, etc.) by offering them:

• A physical spot at the venue
• Direct interaction with potential customers
• Brand visibility in a relaxed, non-salesy environment
• Content opportunities (photos/videos with crowd)
• PR from my side during the event (introductions, brand mentions, and on-ground promotion)

This is not a flea market, it’s a curated experience event, so I’ll be taking limited brands only to avoid overcrowding.

If you’re a:
– Homegrown brand
– Side hustle
– Or testing a new product

and want real customer exposure without high marketing spend, comment or DM and I’ll share details.
