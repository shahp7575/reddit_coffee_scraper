1plm8kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1plm8kv/surprising_grammar_rules_you_should_know_to_avoid/,Surprising Grammar Rules You Should Know to Avoid Mistakes in Spanish,"Here are 5 Spanish grammar rules that learners often make mistakes with. Learn and remember them to boost your Spanish level!

1 . Impersonal “haber” is always singular

When haber means “there is / there are” (existence), it never agrees with the noun that follows.

So it stays singular: hay / había / hubo / habrá / habría / ha habido…

Examples:

* Hay muchas personas aquí. → There are many people here.
* Había tres coches fuera. → There were three cars outside.
* Hubo varios problemas. → There were several problems.
* Ha habido cambios. → There have been changes.

Note: You will hear habían in casual speech (“habían muchas personas”), but in standard Spanish it’s considered incorrect.

2 . Noun endings (-o / -a) don’t always mean masculine / feminine

Most nouns that end in -o are masculine and those that end in -a are feminine, but in Spanish there are also quite a few exceptions, so be careful. Here are some of them:

Examples (masculine ending in -a):

* el día → the day
* el problema → the problem
* el mapa → the map
* el planeta → the planet

Examples (feminine ending in -o):

* la mano → the hand
* la foto (from fotografía) → the photo
* la radio → the radio

3 . Gerunds (-ando / -iendo) can’t be nouns

In Spanish, the gerund (-ando/-iendo) is not used as a noun. So you can’t say “Fumando es malo” to mean “Smoking is bad.” When the verb works as a thing/activity (subject or object), Spanish uses the infinitive: fumar, correr, comer.

Examples:

* Fumar es malo para la salud. → Smoking is bad for your health.
* Me gusta bailar. → I like dancing.
* Comer bien es importante. → Eating well is important.

4 . Don’t leave a preposition at the end

English can end questions with with / for / to / at (“Who are you going with?”).

Spanish doesn’t do that: the preposition goes before the question word (or relative pronoun).

Examples (questions):

* ¿Con quién vas? → Who are you going with?
* ¿De qué hablas? → What are you talking about?
* ¿Para qué es esto? → What is this for?

Examples (relative clauses):

* La persona con la que hablo… → The person (that) I’m talking with…
* El tema del que hablamos… → The topic (that) we talked about…

5 . Generic concepts usually need an article (el / la / los / las)

In Spanish, when you speak about something in general (as a concept), you usually need the definite article: el / la / los / las.

Examples:

* La gente aquí es muy amable. → People here are very kind.
* La biología es interesante. → Biology is interesting.
* Odio las mentiras. → I hate lies.

Note :

* Quiero café. → I want (some) coffee. ✅ (quantity/indefinite)
* El café me encanta. → I love coffee (as a concept). ✅

1plm7mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1plm7mn/mother_cheating_on_my_now_deceased_father_and/,Mother cheating on my now deceased father. And dealing with my own guilt that I never told him or did anything. What should I do now?,"Sorry for the long title I have so many questions and don't have anyone to talk to.

  
I am in my 30's and have some mental health problems. I have a full time job but live with my parents (now just my mother), I have never had a relationship and don't have any friends. I have brothers but they have their own houses and families, we talk but I have not told them about any of this stuff I am dealing with and in a turmoil whether I should.

  
My dad passed away last week. He was in his 70's and had previously had 2 heart attacks and recently he has had covid. We are still waiting for the official confirmation but I think it was his heart combined with the covid and possibly other health issues he had. 

My one comfort that is helping me deal slightly with his death is that I was there with him at the end, he was warm in his bed and I asked him if he was in any pain if he needed painkillers and he told me that he wasn't and he was just tired. Not long after that (maybe an hour later) his eyes opened wide and he stopped breathing, we called an ambulance and they tried to save him but couldn't. I think he had gone immediately when his eyes opened wide. I am hoping so, because I know deep down he feared death and I believe he suffered trauma because his father died of cancer and was in a hospice for a long time and he'd watched him physically deteriorate. My dad actually begged me to promise to finish him off myself if he was ever in a hospital, so I have that comfort knowing that he didn't suffer that because I would never have been able to keep that promise to him. He also had a best friend who also had a heart attack, he made it to hospital but died alone in a corridor at the hospital while waiting. So my dad dreaded the thought of that happening to him and I am at least grateful he went like he did. I believe if he could have chosen a way to go, being at home in bed and going quick would have been towards the top of his preferences. This is probably my only source of comfort that I am clinging to.

  
Regarding my mother. My parents were married for 45 years and my mother is 10 years younger. On the face of it, they had a good marriage with a few ups and downs but they always remained together.

A few years ago when I was doing something on my mothers phone (she asked me to sort it for her, I was not spying) a message popped up that was from some guys name I didn't know saying something really explicit. I clicked it and read through the conversation and it is clear they were having an affair and were for some time. The guy was being extremely cringy and I am disgusted in my mother for falling for it, for example she would send him a picture of herself when she had bought a new dress and he would reply something like ""I will rip that off you straight away"" and would beg for explicit pictures, which as far as I was able to see, my mother never sent. 

Since discovering it, I have resented my mother but have not told her or anybody else that I knew. There were times she was late back from work or meeting a random friend for coffee and I suspect these were times they were meeting. I was always debating in my mind should I tell her I know, should I tell my dad, should I tell my brothers, should I track down this man and confront him by myself and warn him off? But all I ever did was keep it to myself and make sure that my dad was okay and tried to make him happy.

  
Now he has passed away, I checked my mothers phone when she was upstairs and her and this man are still messaging. She has told him about my dad and does seem upset by it all but it hit me like a knife when she has told him something along the lines of ""We can finally be together like our dreams"" referring to herself and this man. It seems that he is also married and his wife has cancer and he is cheating on her. 

I really do not know what to do. It is all so emotional at the moment and I feel so guilty that I did not do anything when my dad was alive. 

Not sure what to expect from this, I think I just needed to put some of my thoughts into words. I feel like I have been typing for hours so I will wrap it up and hope to check later and see if I have actually made any sense or not.

At the café, a young doctor — my recent friend — was watching a couple sitting by the window.
Then he leaned closer to me and whispered:

“Look, he’s flattering his wife.”

“Why do you think so?” I asked.

“She’s sick. Cancer.”

“Oh… poor woman,” I sighed.

“It’s his fault,” the doctor said quietly.

“How come?”

“She got sick from the lack of love. He’s always near her — but never really with her. Cigars, vodka, parties... That’s all his warmth.”

The woman stood up and went to the counter to order coffee.
Her husband remained standing.
When she came back, he said:

“Sit down.”

“No,” she replied. “Not until you sit first.”

The doctor nodded with satisfaction.
“See? I told you.”

But I felt sick from his words.
I pitied them both — the woman and the man.
They were both ill,
but each in a different way:
she — in body,
he — in soul.

And I thought then:

1plm4sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1plm4sy/i_stopped_answering_my_best_friend_after_he/,"I stopped answering my best friend after he relapsed, and I hate who that made me","We’ve been friends since we were sixteen. Same bus stop, same stupid jokes, same cheap diner where the waitress always called us “boys” even when we were in our twenties. He was the guy who showed up. When my car died, he picked me up at 1am without making it a thing. When my mom got sick, he sat in my kitchen and washed dishes like it was normal, like he could scrub the panic out of the room. Then the drinking got louder. At first it was “just weekends,” then it was Tuesday lunches, then it was little plastic shooters in his glove box, then it was the first time I found him asleep in his bathroom with the sink running and his phone buzzing on the floor. He swore he’d stop. He did stop, for a while. He went to meetings, got a sponsor, started drinking coffee like it was a personality. I was so proud it hurt, and I told everyone who would listen. I thought we got him back.



And then he slipped. One missed call turned into ten. His texts got weird, too enthusiastic, too angry, too nothing. He posted a selfie at 3:47am with a caption about “new chapter” and his eyes looked like glass. I drove to his place and he didn’t answer, but I could hear music inside, bass thumping through the door. I sat on the stairs and waited like a dog. When he finally opened it he smiled like I was a stranger, then got mad that I looked worried. There was that sweet sharp smell in the apartment, like cheap booze and sour sweat, and something else I couldn’t name. I tried to keep my voice calm, asked if he was okay, and he laughed. Not mean exactly, just hollow. He said I was “doing the concerned friend thing again” and told me he had it handled. I went home and my hands were shaking so bad I dropped my keys twice. The next day he left me a voice note, slurring, saying he loved me and he was sorry and he’d call later. He never did. I kept the hoodie he left at my place months ago on the back of a chair. I keep thinking I’ll give it back when he’s himself again.



Two weeks ago I got a call from an unknown number. I answered because I thought it might be him. It was a hospital asking if I was family. I lied and said yes because what else do you say. He’d been brought in dehydrated and confused, not dying, but not fine either. I drove there and sat in the parking lot for ten minutes staring at the steering wheel, because I was so mad I could taste it. Mad at him, mad at me, mad at the universe for being predictable. I didn’t go in. I told myself I was protecting my own sanity, that I can’t keep doing this cycle. Then I blocked his number on the drive home. That was the part that felt like cutting off a limb, calm and surgical. Now I keep checking my phone like an idiot, like he’ll somehow get through anyway. I hate that my love has limits, and I hate even more that I found them.

1plm4no,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1plm4no/next_step_machine_and_grinder_help_10001500/,Next Step Machine and Grinder Help [£1000-1500],"My wife and I have been  using a Bambino Plus and Iberital MC2 set up, but feel that it’s time to upgrade. 

The Bambino is reliable but doesn’t always deliver the most consistent shots and feels limited in flavours it can pull out when it comes to certain roasts. 

The Iberital is solid, but adjustment is a huge pain when switching between beans due to the worm screw and associated lack of a clear gauge of grind fineness. 

On average, we drink a couple of coffees each per day - I usually drink long blacks (but would drink more espressos if we had a more capable machine) and she drinks flat whites. We might make coffees for guests now and again, but will seldom (or never) make coffee for more than four.

Grinder 

Because we sometimes switch between regular and decaf, and because I’d like leeway to switch between other roasts easily, I’m very tempted by a single dose grinder. Thoughts on the following would be welcome (current UK sale prices provided for context).  

Eureka Mignon 55s (£200)

Eureka Mignon 65 (£350)

Niche Zero (£550)

DF54 (£176)

DF64 Gen 2 (£305)



Machine

I came into this thinking that we for sure wanted a Lelit Mara X. It seems a considerable advance on the Bambino, but also well-suited to our daily use and preferred level of tinkering.

From reading other threads, I have a slight concern about Lelit durability vs other brands. It sounds like the Profitec 400 fares better on these terms, but it also seems to be in a different price category these days. On another track, having found the Lelit Elizabeth for not much more, should we be going for a double boiler (though perhaps overkill for our use…?). In the other direction, would a more modest POP UP or Go be more suited given our relatively modest demands?

Quick Mill POP-UP (£800)

Profitec Go (£849)

Lelit Mara X PL62X HX (£899)

Lelit Elizabeth (£1080)

Ascaso Uno PID (£1200)

Profitec 400 (£1279)

Overall, I’d be very keen to get the machine and grinder for less than £1500 (but really wouldn’t complain if the bill ended up smaller!). My hope is a set up which will be a considerable advance from what we have, and which will last a number of years (without breaking and without us feeling itchy to upgrade).

(Such as a C47 remake)","Note: This is basically assuming the game has the combat systems of Absolution (Armor, limited regenerating health and more intelligent enemies/backup waves with the rest of the systems being from WOA.) 

  
Like Hokkaido, You can only bring in items/pick alternative starting points as mastery bonuses after already clearing the mission once, default is same as C47 with 47 in his suit outside with no items.

  
I am assuming since this game will likely have a save system, that the mission will be one big mission but they could still split them. 

Part 1:



Starting Locations:

Front Gate (AKA default)

Rear Gate (1st level mastery, basically cuts out having to run around the Asylum for the new rear entrance) 

  
Undercover as Asylum Orderly (1st floor)

Undercover as Asylum Doctor (2nd floor close to Kovac's office)

Undercover as Asylum Inmate (close to Agent Smith)



Disguises are mostly the same as original 47 though now ""generic"" Asylum Doctors exist instead of just Kovacs and Ort-Meyer, they basically function as a better version of the Orderly disguise and Doctors themselves function as Enforcers.

In addition to the main entrance (which goes the same way in C47, with SWAT being called though with a bit more of a notable delay compared to C47 giving you more time to prepare as opposed to them somehow showing up instantly though SWAT is now also called if 47 is spotted by any cameras since Ort-Meyer is monitoring them regardless of disguise), it is now possible to scale to the roof from the outside as well as a rear fire door that a single orderly having a smoke break is guarding.

  
Notably going through the front door is the only way to have the Asylum itself be ""safe"" for suit, Orderly and Doctor staff will leave 47 alone (to not tip him off) and only turn hostile when SWAT arrive, (to give an in-story reason for 47 knowing about them, I'd have Diana manage to send one last cut-off transmission of ""SWAT team has been called in"" once 47 either uses the front door or is spotted by any cameras if the player bypasses it both explaining why Diana loses contact and seems to assume 47 is dead in SA as well as giving 47 a reason to act like a player that knows the SWAT is coming.) as if 47 sneaks in via an other way, he'll be identified as an intruder and an alarm raised if spotted in his suit.

  
Due to the Asylum being a rather close-knit group (with only a few genuine doctors and orderly staff that is unaware of Ort-Meyer's experiments) most disguises on this map have a heavy enforcer presence. 

Like in C47, a large amount of weaponry is scattered around (and on replay playthroughs, mastery bonuses enable a single ICA item to be placed in any of these caches) if the player finds themselves fighting the Asylum Staff or SWAT in addition to first aid stations for recovering health before heading underground or on the way back.

Kovacs, like C47, has been intentionally left out of the loop on the ambush to lure 47 so while he is an enforcer (as he will eventually recognize 47 if he sees him) he is notably left out of the plan and is not armed unlike other asylum staff members.

  
Kill methods for Kovacs: (If he is either kept as an optional target like C47, mandatory or made semi-mandatory such as dropping a keycard that helps enter the basement)

Like in C47, you can kill him directly but for accidents/methods:

Kovacs now briefly leaves his office to assess one of his patients, his path taking him past the obligatory badly placed water cooler with an electrical socket underneath it.

A cup of coffee in his office that can be poisoned when he leaves his office.

Freeing the patient he's assessing, who will kill Kovacs themselves when Kovacs next checks on them. (Since the asylum isn't legit, it could be a minor plot point that it's clear some of the inmates are fully sane and just being held there so they can be experimented on.) 

  
Going to the basement should have at least two methods: 

The normal elevator method, I am considering maybe making it a bit \*more\* hidden (in C47 original there's literally nothing hiding the hidden passage so perhaps a passage leading to a locked door that requires a keycard) so the trick of just running out the elevator doesn't work and making it slightly more plausible (so it just looks like a badly placed maintenance area.) 

  
Some sort of vent that 47 can open, this would be tricky due to the vent actually being closed and shut tight unlike most Absolution vents, 47 needs to locate various tools (and unlike WOA, these are kept away in restricted areas so asylum inmates cant get their hands on them) around the asylum to actually open the grating. (and like the original method perhaps this too benefits from helping Smith.)

Like in original, there's a camera guarding the elevator entrance.



Part 2:  Meet your brother.

  
If you used the Elevator, it goes the same as C47 with Agent 48's gradually getting released, this mostly goes as a more fair (since 48's in original A: always knew where 47 was and B: were even better at aiming exclusively for the head than the SWAT team) version of original where stealth is actually possible.

If we used the vent or any other alternative ways in (or even disabling the cameras outright if it's possible) then Ort-Meyer will start releasing the 48s either if any staff spot 47 or if 47 eventually reaches his inner sanctum area.

Like in original, the 48's mostly leave one-at-a-time to make things fair and allow 47 to stealthily take them down (but take too long and you'll have multiple active 48's which will make things harder.) though I  would have either the last ""wave"" or last 48 clone carry a minigun instead of only 47 getting one.

The fully stealthy SA way for dealing with the 48's is to find a some sort of second security room that is heavily guarded by Asylum staff, this lets the player wipe the cameras, disable the gas trap for if 47 scans himself and make it so it opens the room Ort-Meyer is hiding in (as the way of reaching him without releasing the 48s) as well as turn on a ""fail-safe"" gassing all the 48's getting them out of the way without a fight. (built incase they turned against Ort-Meyer.)

  
Facing down Ort-Meyer goes roughly the same, if the 48s were active, he initially assumes 47 is one and can be shot before he realizes that 47 isn't one.

  
If the player manages to sneak in, he's an Enforcer for every disguise 47 has and does a routine where he can be killed in less direct ways:

If the player doesn't turn on the gas right way, they can create an opening between the dormant 48 clones and Ort-Meyer's room (opening another vent or maybe breaking some glass) and then turn on the gas, killing Ort-Meyer with the same gas he intended to trap 47 with. (or if we're keeping C47's ending, the gas doesn't kill him outright but he can't do anything to stop 47 snapping his neck .) 

Ort-Meyer is waiting on a body being delivered to the autopsy room (a failed clone) for an autopsy, 47 can pretend to be that clone (perhaps requiring a patient's outfit for this) and kill Ort-Meyer with his own scalpel when he goes to cut open 47.

If we're keeping the more ""Mad science"" style from Contracts, dropping a clone pod on him.

Since this is one map and if we aren't \*too\* concerned with making the player always repeat C47's ending with 47 snapping Ort-Meyers neck after his dying speech, possibly it is possible to open the basement, sabotage the 48 clones then let the SWAT teams inevitably stumble into the basement (with the 48 clones killing the SWAT team if they're still active) and letting them shoot Ort-Meyer in a stand-off. 

Though if the player lets SWAT stumble into the basement without getting rid of the 48 clones, SWAT will manage to take a few of them down so the ""direct"" path is still easier if you manage to fully evade the SWAT teams and want to let them make your job easier. (the second Contracts-style wave will never enter the basement after the first team doesn't come back up.) 

Part 3: Aftermath.

Firstly, I'd do a half/half with the conflicting C47/Contracts versions (SWAT storms in C47 while Contracts seems to have the SWAT team lose 1-2 members then back off entirely until 47 comes back up) with the fact you can avoid SWAT being called.

I'd have there be a final wave all-enforcer wave complete with the cut helicopter sniper from the Contracts leaked beta as a punishment for taking far too long, you want to get out before SWAT can fully mobilize. 

If you manage to remain stealthy, then the confrontation with the 48s results in the police being alerted late enough it's actually possible to kill Ort-Meyer loudly then leave before the Romanian police show up. (and if the gas method is used, perhaps they aren't even called at all.)

  
This mostly goes the same as Contracts Asylum Aftermath outside of the cut sniper being restored since this isn't the first level of the game anymore.

No one forced me to do anything, it was beautiful Americans of all ages and races who are seeking God in a very personal way. Obviously no church is perfect but I found Christ in the Eucharist here. (Something I was told only belonged or existed in the Eastern Orthodox Church) I found a congregation who didn’t force me to be Slavic or Greek to fit in. No one forced me to hate being who I was or tried to restrict how many people could meet Christ or interact with him. 

The episcopal church has in my opinion tried to unite as many people to Christ as possible. Without the impossible standards of Rome or the Ethnic standards of Eastern Orthodoxy.

Looks like my next pair of boots will start production soon. They are greener pasture which from what I’ve read is just a variant of CXL in the same thickness as Nicks other CXL offerings but a much more pliable leather. I chose GP for its softness but don’t what to give up durability in the pursuit easier break in or a more flexible leather.

I currently have 4 pair of boots starting from oldest. 64 brown, maxsupport black, 64 monarch and Dublin natural light. The 64 brown is by far my favorite so much so that I’m doubling up on the leather with another order. Not a huge fan of the monarch, not sure why but it’s so darn close to 64 brown that it just gets lost. MS is nice but darn stiff, I like the leather but it’s way more leather than I need. The Dublin’s are to new to have formed a solid opinion. So far the DNL are much more pliable than anticipated and needed no break in on the leather front. 

So to bring this back around the greener pasture boots will be dedicated hikers which will more than likely get treated the worse out of all my boots. Am I giving up durability for compliance? Should I be looking at the Spokane leathers, they seem to be the same weight but maybe a little tougher?

1pllwpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1pllwpu/my_estranged_dad_wants_to_meet_my_kid_after_7/,My estranged dad wants to meet my kid after 7 years and I don’t know what the “right” move is,"I (31M) cut contact with my dad when I was 24. It wasn’t one big movie moment, it was years of him being unreliable, drinking, disappearing, then popping back up with gifts and apologies like that erased everything. He missed my high school graduation because he “couldn’t find parking” (later found out he was at a bar), he forgot my 21st entirely, and the last straw was him showing up to my apartment at 2am, drunk, insisting we “talk it out” while my then girlfriend was inside terrified. The next day he texted a long apology and then went silent for months. After that I stopped chasing him. I moved, changed numbers, blocked him on socials. My mom (they divorced ages ago) basically said: you can’t fix someone who won’t even show up sober. I built a normal life without him. I’m married now, my partner is amazing, we have a 6 year old who has never met my dad and only knows “grandpa” from my partner’s parents. I genuinely thought my dad would die and I’d hear about it secondhand. Then about six weeks ago, a letter shows up in my mailbox. No return address, just my full name in handwriting I recognised immediately. Inside was a 3 page letter, written in blue pen, no dramatic sob story, just: “I’m sober. I’m in AA. I have a sponsor. I’m trying to do the steps. I need to make amends, and you’re the biggest one.” He also wrote that he found out I have a kid and he doesn’t want to “leave this world” without meeting them. That line made my stomach drop, because it felt like emotional pressure, even if he didn’t mean it that way. He ended with “I don’t expect forgiveness. I’m asking for one coffee.” A week later, another letter. This time he included a Polaroid of himself holding a mug with some cheesy slogan on it, like proof he’s a normal guy now. He looks older, thinner, kinda tired. He also included a photo of an AA chip and said he’s been sober 14 months. Third letter came two days ago. He wrote “Dad, always” at the bottom and that honestly made me angry. You don’t get to disappear for years and then claim the title like it’s reserved for you forever.



Here’s the part that’s messing with me. I haven’t replied at all. Not even “stop writing.” I keep reading the letters and then hiding them in a drawer like I’m 16 again. My mom says do not respond, because any response is an opening and he will wedge himself in. My partner is more cautious than anti: he says maybe meet my dad once in a public place, daytime, no kid involved, and see if he’s actually stable. One problem is my kid noticed an envelope when the mail came and asked why someone keeps writing to me, and I stupidly said “it’s just someone from a long time ago.” Now my kid is curious and keeps asking, like kids do. If I tell them “that’s your grandpa,” it becomes a thing. If I keep being vague, I feel like I’m lying in my own house. I also have this fear that if I meet my dad, he’ll be charming and teary and convincing, and I’ll start hoping again, and then he’ll vanish and I’ll be the one who opened the door. And if I let him meet my kid and he disappears again, my kid gets a new kind of hurt I never had at that age. On the flip side, what if he really is sober and this is the one time he’s actually doing it right, and I’m punishing him forever for being sick and selfish in the past? I hate even thinking that because it makes me feel like I’m supposed to “reward” him for finally acting like an adult. I don’t need him to be my dad. I don’t want him in my home. But I also can’t shake the feeling that ignoring him completely might bite me later, like he escalates or shows up. He lives about 2 hours away (he wrote the town name, didn’t give an address). He already has my address somehow, which makes me uneasy. What should I do? Do I reply with boundaries and meet him alone, or do I shut it down completely and protect my peace? If I do meet him, what rules are actually smart and not just me pretending I’m in control?

Every time I see a new pair of AR glasses announced, they're always trying to cram displays into both lenses, and the result is... well, they look like something out of a cyberpunk cosplay. Not exactly something I'd wear to grab coffee.

But what about going monocular? Like, just one small display in one lens. Yeah, you lose the ""immersive"" factor, but like

* Way less bulk and weight
* Actually looks like normal glasses (or close to it)
* Battery life would be way better
* Probably cheaper to manufacture
* For most use cases (notifications, navigation, quick translations, teleprompter stuff), you really don't need both eyes anyway

I feel like the industry is so obsessed with chasing the ""full AR vision"" that they're ignoring what people might actually want to wear in public without looking like a tech demo.

Google Glass was monocular and got roasted for a lot of reasons, but ""having one display"" wasn't really the problem imo. The execution and the creepy factor were.

Anyone else feel like a well-designed monocular setup could actually hit the sweet spot between functionality and not looking like a complete dork? Or am I coping?

Its more my style to wake up and google (yeah maybe not in China?) for a coffee shop, get a coffee then go somehow and wonder about, see what I find. 

Ill be fine doing that in Shanghai, but I figure while there i may as well go elsewhere and the tech malls of Shenzhen seem interesting to me.  I was thinking a few days in Shenzhen then maybe bail to Bangkok or something. And I was planning to take the train from Shanghai to Shenzhen... Any reason not to?  I know it takes from 7hrs to 12 or something, but I am cool with that as long as I have a window seat.  I'll see more of China than on any plane. Oh and on that, do you get to choose your seat?  I have been looking and the western resellers don't seem to allow it.  Also I cannot figure out where the extra time goes for the 12 hr trarins vs the 7 hr ones?..  Again the reseller sites don't say anything about it. Does the train stop somewhere? And prices, seem rather high, at similar to Japanese Shinkansen pricing (when everything else seems cheaper), are the resellers marking the tickets up a lot?

But should I be looking to head elsewhere instead of Shenzhen? I am open to options. Maybe HK instead?

(TW: Suicidal thoughts)","I am a current senior student, studying at the best university in my country for free, and I’ve been doing really well for myself up until a few months ago. I decided to brave the wilds and take any opportunity I got to grow, and I became a leader of university wide organizations, student councils, and projects. I was enjoying it at first, but after some time it began to pile up. I bit off more than I could chew, and I fell like Icarus.

I stopped going to my classes and finished or resigned from my positions. Some of my relationships soured because I didn’t know how to ask for help and was just avoiding everything, playing my comfort games like League of Legends. I got on probation for a semester as a result, and I failed that probation too because I just didn’t have any motivation or will to even go to class. I tried at first, showed up to half the semester, was passing exams, still doing good at public speaking, but I think my brain still hasn’t recovered from such a massive blow, and I went back to avoiding everything again. Now that I failed the second probation, I’m probably going to get kicked out of the university.

I don’t know how Dr. K survived it. For months now, I’ve just been contemplating that one Albert Camus quote, “Should I die, or drink coffee?” Every day I tell myself different things to hang on, that maybe something will change and give me another opportunity to rise again. “One more day,” I keep repeating.

I don’t know what this situation is called. I don’t know if I’m depressed, entitled or overreacting, but I feel myself hanging on just by a thread, like something could pop off one moment and I’d do it and log off the earth. I don’t know where it would come from, my dysfunctional family, another close relationship souring, or some other thing, but one of these days it might just snap. I want to keep living and experience human life and everything it has to give, but my brain is just telling me that it’s already game over. 

If anyone has been through academic failure or burnout and managed to rebuild themselves, please let me know how. Thank you for reading.

Looking for Tips Before I Start Experimenting,"I have been increasingly interested in cold coffee and I am trying to get the right beans for it. Some people are saying that you need to have the largest possible grind like really coarse, while others are saying that a medium-coarse or even a medium grind may work depending on your setup. I am really keen to hear the opinion of other cold brew lovers before I start buying different beans and trying them out. Also any recommendations of grinds would be great.

I read up that coarse grinding is preferred generally because it limits the extraction of bitter compounds and mud during brewing. Bigger particles will absorb water and their extraction will be slower, which is basically the objective of cold brewing. But there are also people who argue that some beans are better with slightly finer grind as it will enhance the flavor. However, I am quite careful in this case as I don't want my coffee to be silty.

I am also wondering if using certain types of beans is a major factor in taste difference? There are some discussions on Reddit claiming that the brightness of light roast beans is preserved while dark roast beans are smooth and thus the classic cold brew taste. Besides, I spotted on some wholesale sites (Amazon, Arabica Trade, Roastify, Alibaba) that you can that one can buy bulk coffee beans along with grinders, which can be quite useful if I decide to make cold brew regularly and want to cut down the costs in the long run.

For those who are brewing at home, what grind size and roast do you swear by? And does the grind vary depending on whether you steep for 12 hours, 18 hours, or longer?",1,1765632926.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False

We have been together for just over a year now. We used to be in a polygamous relationship. So it was me (22f), my partner, his (ex)fiancé (mother of kids). Him and his ex fiancé were together for 16 years.

Skipping a load of trauma dumping but now it’s just me and my partner, and ex fiancé has blocked me ( I didn’t notice for two months until my partner told me, that’s how little I contact her.) I broke up with him as I couldn’t do polyamory anymore, and he ended up contacting me saying he has left her. Him and his fiancé broke up 4 months ago. And I’m really struggling on what a normal relationship between ex’s with kids together looks like?

He wants to go round, and have family dinners etc regularly without me (not just on special occasions) just with her and the kids. He wants to talk to her and go out for coffee and hang out with her. And I’m just not comfortable with any of that? But I’m not sure if I’m just being an asshole and jealous for feeling that way. I don’t want him to have any contact with her at all but I know that’s not an option due to the kids and I would never ask that for him. I know how important being able to coparent is. I just don’t know where I stand on setting boundaries.

((Edit:) for more context, we are hoping to move to a house that can accommodate me, my partner and his kids in July. A scenario he has brought up has been “what if the kids don’t want to come over to our house though? Or if they want to see me and not you? I still want to be able to see them” to which I responded, I will leave the house and stay somewhere else while you have that time with the kids. He looked visibly ?disappointed/fed up/upset when I said this.

He still pays for the house his ex and kids live in.)

What I am sure is not proper is that when I place the portafilter, one side drips heavy while the other side barely gets any flow.

I didn’t take a single work day off in the last few years because of my contractual job. I am slowly forgetting how my mom’s food tasted like. 

There is always a better choice that can be ‘hypothetically’ be made. I am in no control over making decisions to make my life better. I am on a track where good outcomes are based on luck and any reduced effort in putting hard work will certainly lead to bad outcomes.

I try to stay compliant to the law and rules of the place I am living in, bothering no one. Yet, I am always a second class person and ‘out of place’. I have normalized that feeling for myself but there will be situations/moments that will sting and cut deep.

I got no looks or game or whatever it’s called to fit in the dating world. No woman would ever want me. In this fast paced world where everything could be decided with a single glance of the profile or short coffee chat, I have no chance of impressing a single woman.

or making things up. im a minor and 3-4 years ago smth traumtic happend to me, i zoned out rlly bad when it happend and i was rlly scared, i talked abt it to my parents and they did stuff but it didnt stop me from being scared of everything, even doubting my own parents and family that they might traumatize me too, but tht was 4 years ago and i think ive grown from it. since it was the pandemic, i never had any friends of some sort but my classmates since i didnt have a phone at tht age yet and i can only reach my classmate through onlien class stuff so i was basically alone in terms of socializing. i was told to not bring it up unless necerssary to not cause fuss or unecessary drama. after a year it was finally the first year of face to face classes again and i couldnt remember a single thing that happend that time, like 0 knowldge, my birthday, christmas, new year, a single day, absolutely nothing and that scares me. whenever an old friend brings it up i js try to agree pretending i lived that year but i never felt like i actually did, i was like js living at that time, i never felt anything, i wasnt sad, it wasnt depression, i dont remember anything at all so i cant really go in detail. a year after it started getting ""better"" i guess. i was hanging out with people, making friends, but i still dont remember anything tht happend, maybe sum of it unlike the year before it, i was actually ""having fun"" but it felt unreal, like it was happening js because it was happening. i never had a thought of my own or whatvever, i never had an action of my own, i know they were mine but i dont feel like they were mine, like i was watching myself live through the whole thing. that year i met someone online tht actually felt like a real person and now someone part of the script of my life, tht helped me feel a connection after years and years of feeling alone. but a few months after that i developed an eating disorder and i started starving myself and exercising alot, i rlly wanted my life to ""turn back to normal"" and be liek a normal person so i started sleeping eary since i was sleeping at 4am everyday tht year, i ate normally, woke up normally, startedeercising normally. then i felt real, i finally felt ""human"" again, i knew what i was thinking i new what i was doing, i started caring about what i look like i started being concious, i started speaking up for myself, i became a person. then i lost my ED and recovered, so i stopped doing the routine of living like a normal person. it came all rushing back again, the feeling of constantly ""dreaming"" like floating, doing everything as if im not the one doing it. like im playing a first person game, best way to describe it in my opinion, like, yes im doing all of it but its not me, im js watching myself everything feels so fake. now is the 3-4th year of it and since im ""conscious"" now i started realizing what im feeling because years ago i never understood wht i was experincing, i thought i was just puberty stuff because i js turned a teenager those years but now i realized its not normal, i though i js gained conciousness like a 5 year old gainign conciousness btu i feel like this is different, i sumwhat call it my frontal lobe developing but i dont really know.  i saw an anime called lain serial experiments and i found it very comforting, i dont know why, so i serached up the main characters personality and i run into ""dpdr"", i paused with that hyperfixation for a few months and i started researching about it again and i realized all of the symptoms were being experinced by me, constant fear, numbness, feeling dreamlike. i also once palpitated by drinking alot of coffee and that time the dissasiciation felt rlly heavy on me, i talk to my parents abt feeling weird and they js laughed it off and told their friends abt me palpitating cuz of drinking too much coffee and that i should learn from my experince. but it felt rlly scary, like the thing ive been feeling for years felt so heavy at that time, like the whole thing came unto me that time, but i didnt tell tht feeling abt them so they probably js taught of my paliptiating and drinking too much coffee. these past few months ive been feeling ""Real"" in the slightest bit i guess but since ive been researching abt dpdr and understanding it and feeling very heard for the first time, i started dissasociating very bad again. i asked chatgpt abt it (very bad ik but i dont rlly have anyone to talk to abt this) and i explained my whole situation and it said tht i was showing very big signs of chronic dpdr, like watching myself from a glass, everytyhing feeling unreal, and stuff like that thts hard to explain. the really big reason i cant talk abt ts to anyone is bcs i dont think anyone will believe me. im top of my classes, everyone i know likes me and finds me funny and im the ""extrovert"" of the group, especially im always seen as the mom of the group taking resposibility and everything, so if i talk to atleast a single soul abt it they wouldnt believe me im sure. im tirred of it and i think its getting worse, my momory loss is getting worse and worse i feel constant fear of i dont even know of what every day. i always distract myself by doing alot of things, going out with friends, studying hard, watching movies, playign games. but everytime i get atelast a minute of alone time for my mind to think it automitically goes back to dissasociating and im scared of it, very. i js wanna live like a normal person now, im not even sure if im js going through puberty but im very sure none of the people i know experinces what i am experiencing, atleats not for a long time. i feel like im going back to the time where i cant remember A WHOLE year, i dont wanna feel that anymore. pls anyone reply to this because i js want someone knowledgable enough to understand. thank you",1,1765632318.0,dpdr,0,0.99,False

It started as foster care with a goal change, then a long stretch of court dates, home studies, and me learning acronyms at 2am with cold coffee. Day to day she’s actually hilarious in this dry, “are you done being cringe, mom?” way, and then she’ll turn around and be so gentle with our dog that it breaks my heart a little. She draws tiny comics in the margins of her homework, she reorganized the spice rack by smell (??) and she has a battered purple hoodie she refuses to wash because it “smells like safe.” When things are good, they’re really good: late night mac and cheese, nail polish at the kitchen table, her teaching my husband how to do a proper braid, her leaving me sticky notes like “dont forget lunch, u get hangry.” But anytime we get close to anything emotional, especially in family therapy, she hits this line like a shield: “You wouldn’t have chosen me if you knew the real me.”



The therapy office is one of those places that smells like peppermint tea and has a basket of fidget toys. Maya always takes the same squishy cube and picks at the corner until it’s basically flat. Last session the therapist asked her what she thinks will happen if she tells us what she’s scared of, and Maya shrugged and said that line again. Then she added, “Like, you picked the version of me that says please and thank you. Not the real one.” I just sat there with my mouth half open. If I go straight to reassurance, it feels like a cheesy speech she won’t believe. If I try to be honest, I’m terrified I’ll say the wrong thing and confirm her worst fear. After sessions I sit in my car in the parking lot and cry for 5 or 10 minutes, then I wipe my face and go buy groceries like a normal person. My husband is supportive but very practical, like “we’re showing up, we’re consistent, keep doing that.” Which is true, but it doesn’t give me words in the moment. So what do you say when a kid says that, without making it a performance or guilt-tripping them? Do I ask “what does the real you mean?” Do I keep it simple like “I’m here, even when it’s hard”? If you’ve been on either side of adoption or foster care, what response felt real to you?

1pll24e,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pll24e/the_most_stumped_ive_ever_been_in_dating/,The Most Stumped I've Ever Been In Dating,"Hi Reddit! If all goes according to plan, I (22M) would like to make this woman (23F) my girlfriend, however I'm not even sure if she likes me in the first place. 

  
A tiny bit of background: I met this girl through several mutual friends who go to college somewhat close to my home (about 30-40 minutes away). We have met/interacted in person several times and they've always been pleasant.

  
I am absolutely familiar with ""the game"" at this point, but both mutual parties and I cannot figure out if this girl likes me or not. Generally speaking, I don't think she's the type to lead somebody on. She is an extremely blunt person and often speaks her mind, so it's very unlikely she would attempt to spare my feelings in any capacity. In addition, it's likely that our mutual friends would choose me if things went bad between us, so there's no incentive for her to try anything with bad intentions. When we've interacted in person, I've always thought she was being flirty with me; she initiates physical contact, tries to feed me things, and (playfully) makes fun of me to friends and family. This all seems great so far, right? The only problem is that she is genuinely horrible at communicating over the phone. Although it has gotten noticeably better over the past week or two, I can't help but think about the past with her. Is it possible that she has begun to develop feelings for me over the past couple weeks and that's the reason why it's gotten better? Absolutely. But I just can't shake the idea of ""If a person really likes you, they're not going to not respond or forget about you"". (*I can go into more detail about some of these things in the comments if you guys want to know more*)



In addition, if I do end up asking this girl out, I'm not really sure what to do about it. Though she goes to school somewhat close to me, she lives around an hour away from school, meaning she lives about an hour and a half from me. Although I'm sure she's going to visit me and my friends over break (I haven't asked her about it yet), I don't really know what I can do in terms of a date. Coffee? Arcade? Sure. She also mentioned something to me that she really wanted to buy (and no, she wasn't trying to get me to buy it for her lol) but she didn't think she was going to because it was a waste of money (it was a toy for like $30-$40). I was thinking about getting it for her, as I definitely have the money, but I think that it might be a little soon for something like that.

  
**TLDR:** Stranger is looking for advice regarding a questionable situation/relationship with a girl!

Any advice you can offer would be amazing! I really like this girl, but I would much rather be given the truth and have my feelings hurt than continue to try driving down a dead end. Thanks!",1,1765631525.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1pll1m7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pll1m7,Community Christmas Party / January Events,"Good morning, Grand Rapids. Or maybe it's not. One would have to go outside to determine that sort of thing, and going outside is not how you have a good day in 2025. It's a catch-22, to be sure. That's why we had ourselves a productive wee Member Meeting inside the warehouse to discuss upcoming activities and projects, plus a distribution of duties, and we came up with the following:

1. I'm supposed to let you (reddit; the hivemind that argues with itself) know that on Friday, the **26th of December** we will be having a soup-filled, hot-chocolate laden combination of **dance party and live art thing**, replete with DJ types and interactive art projects, brought to you by whatever a ""Velvet Fox"" is, from the hour of 7pm until the stroke of midnight. Megan would like you to wear pajamas and appreciate the many things she is building and/or installing for the event. I would like you to decompress after the exhausting ordeal of Christmas by wiggling on a huge steel floor. Both things are possible simultaneously. You may [RSVP](http://www.donotstart.art/xmas.html) at your leisure.
2. We are having another **OPEN HOUSE** shortly thereafter for those of you who could not attend the November one (or for those of you who did and just want to eat more cheese). If you know any artists who would like a studio, people who like books and movies and ""third spaces"", people who lecture on obscure topics, community organisers, shut-ins, oddballs, rogue plumbers, retired professors, angle grinder aficionados, etc, please bring them along.
3. Nikki informed me that by selecting good, enjoyable movies for our Wednesday double-features I have been by extension ignoring the vast and untapped wealth of *bad* movies currently sitting unscreened in the world. This was revelatory information, and I can admit my blindness and mistakes. Therefore, on the **9th of January** we will be showing **The Room** twice, just to start at the bottom of a very deep well and work our way up through the murk from there. This is a Friday event, not our usual Wednesday night film fundango, and it is only $5 so let's come together to watch the worst movie ever successfully produced, and marvel at dialogue so rich and lifelike that an entire generation or two now speaks like that in public.
4. The ATYN (US) **Life Drawing Workshop** that got bumped last week will begin at **7pm this upcoming Thursday (the 18th)**. Art supplies are on hand, models are booked, and I built a large room for them to lounge in between sessions. If you are an aspiring artist, an established figure drawing person, or a total novice please join us for a night of drawing people much braver and more nude than you in a large and attractive room full of music and drinks. Paper and pencils provided or bring your medium of choice.
5. At the very end of January we will be having a **gallery show** for the current crop of studio artists and/or warehouse members and their friends. I believe it's on the 30th of January, but I am clearly winging this post while drinking a gallon of coffee in a desperate attempt to make my neurons fire properly. More information will come as we get it all sorted. But there will be a gallery show of art from the people who make it, and it will be at the end of January.

We also decided that Winter is gross (we didn't make it gross, but we collectively agreed upon its grossness) and have changed the hours in which we are open to the public to **10am-6pm every day**. If you want to come see the space and discuss hosting a meeting, renting a studio, donating tools or books or whatever, examining the state of the world, supporting the arts, arranging a class, etc. that is the daily window for entry.

We also got a **very large screen printing machine**, and are in the process of plumbing in the sinks for it. Cam is excited to host classes to teach people how to use it, as he is a screenprinter by trade and vocation, and would like to share that skill with anyone who wants to learn. There is a bit of setup required, but once we have all the supplies and such we can begin making odd t-shirts and you can too.

There will be website updates soon relating to all of this, and hopefully a better RSVP system for all of it as well. As nobody here is a huge fan of the internet it takes longer than it should and we apologise. In the meantime keep an eye on [www.donotstart.art](http://www.donotstart.art/) or just come down and say hello to whoever is milling about covered in sawdust and sweat. Otherwise, try not to bludgeon your fellow holiday shoppers to death with a giant candy cane display or sail off the road on a patch of invisible ice whilst speeding to purchase gifts. I believe with enough effort most of us can survive until 2026, just long enough to witness the rise of Skynet and its inevitable realisation that nuclear holocaust is the logical solution to the human condition. In the meantime, come to our Christmas party and meet my friend Sarah Connor. She's single, and it seems very important that she meets someone soon.",11,1765631482.0,grandrapids,3,0.87,False

""Ship fast"" is slightly wrong advice. Ship fast, sure, but make damn sure it's production-ready. Not some half-baked prototype that craters when a user types a funky habit name with emojis. People shrug off ""coming soon"" features. They bail forever on core stuff that glitches. Learned that the hard way with a reminder bug that had me apologizing in reviews at midnight.

1plkwli,https://i.redd.it/a1x6dn5hvy6g1.jpeg,Why Nahyuta is a Weak prosecutor and why he drags Spirit of Justice down with him,"What's Crack-a-lackin' homies, today i am going to say why i believe Nahyuta Sadmhandi is a weak prosecutor... like we all don't know that, i gotta say i knew he was bad... but only playing Spirit of Justice recently could really prepare me for how much i would despise him, like i am about at the near end of Turnabout Storyteller and i now that he's not the prosecutor for Turnabout revoulution and turnabout time travller so i basically have played most of what he's prosecuting, but as my first evidence i'll say this

1. Spirit of Justice's opening case ruins Nahyuta before he even appears

so i have ve seen that the foreign turnabout has mixed reception but i personally love it and i think it is the best setting in the Ace attorney series and how it's introduced is great, and we firsthand see how trials in khurain are unfair to the accused with Ahlbi who i actually cared about and felt the stakes of the defense culpability act, i thought Peeslubin' Andistandhin who i was expecting to think was a weak culprit was actually really fun and reminded me of Marlon with his singing... probably because i had jut got done with reclaimed

i think that Gaspen Payne was actually one of the best parts of this case, to be honest... i found him more threatening than Nahyuta... i'm that serious, like the idea of Gaspen payne, a character i hated in Dual Destinies becoming the chief prosecutor in Khurin by abusing it's corrupt system, and his design was really fun, but here comes my problem... Foreign turnabout sets Khu'rain up... TOO WELL, like the minute that phoenix steps up to the stand, the gallery is chanting death and it's really new and exciting, but it does get a bit old by the end of the case and you basically tune them out which i did find rayfa very annoying in this case but by the time Nahyuta shows up in the next case, you're too used to Khu'rain telling you that you're going to hell that it doesn't feel threatening when Nahyuta says it makingg him underwhelming

2. he gets overshadowed by the villian of the magical turnabout

Even in his first trial, he's quite forgettable even before we even see him he's overshadowed by another, that being... ROGER RETINZ! like i hate him and wanted to take him down when i learned about the contract against Trucy that he tricked her into signing it to make her owe 3 million and the scene with all the ed tape over the office actually was very upsetting nd with all the papparatzi actually made me concerend with how Apollo and athena were to get through it, i wanted to punch Roger in that moment and it's really effective as i cared about the office as it's the same one phoenix inherited from mia after she was killed, so he was the number 1 priority to be taken down

i do feel he would've been better if the magicial turnabout had two investigation and trial segments like the other second cases, i can obviously see why that wasn't the cae due to the contract but it would've given Nahyuta more time to really introduce himself, i just have to say that Nahyuta... is really boring like all he says is 'you're going to hell'  that would be like if edgeworth said ""i love my perfect record"" or fransiska ""i want revenge what you did to him"" or ""i hate you for not saving her trite"" with Godot but they said it over and over and over again, despite this i felt like nahyuta actually felt reasonable... his smug face just feels like he's conceding a bit, the only animatuon i like of his is the one where he's hit with his beads but even Roger's breakdown is one of my favourite so Roger became the highlight of that case for me

also a quick question, why didn't apollo just use contract law against roger he could ay that as Trucy is a minor she shouldn't be held accountable and also both sides of a contract should be in on the terms, i can get why they didn't as it would be to easy to defeat him though i don't get why they didn't do that after apollo exposed the clipboard trick, it's not like it would be obscure legal knowedge most of the audience would at least know about contract law somewhat

3. He's boring and brings Spirit of Justice down with him

then we get to... the Rite of Turnabout, i thought it was a good case and seeing Maya again was fun, and i found the twist with Tahrust really interesting as i knew Behleeb was the culprit but i thought she did it to Tahrust though i had no idea about Puhray before playing it so that made the twist better, i also thought Datz Arebal  was an fun witness and talking to him in Dhurke's old office was actually very fun with him pulling out the knife onlt for him to pull out an apple or his suprised face that made him look like a One Piece character

i'd even say that this case redeemed Rayfa for me, i thought she was really  childish and annoying before but now i can see that she is just a victim of khurain's system where the divination seance was a peice of evidence meant to be questioned and the fact it's become the only thing set her up to feel like there was something wrong with her when phoenix questions it and i can tell how she acts the way does with her father: inga being chief justice when we meet him again in this case, i also really liked we got to spend a good bit of time with her in the investigatiosn

oh yeah... Nahyuta is there too, to be honest even in his home country he is boring! like i did enjoy Datz' being his witness as Anohn inmhus' but as i felt that we were actually getting somewhere BAM! he throws the GUILTY verdict and i was like HUH? that felt like it came out of nowhere, i know that's it's supposed to show the defense culpability act in action but i felt like there should've been a way to do it better here, like i felt perfectly fine here not like we were failing at all unlike in Turnabout Goodbyes where the same thing happens showing how threatening Von karma is before larry comes in, and we  learn of nahyuta's connection to apollo here and i'll get back to that don't you worry but i'll just say... Spirit of Justice would'nt be as diviive of a game if Nahyuta wasn't in it, like i'd say all of it's cases even the third one are  great it's just that nahyuta drags down the game, and i wished Simon was the prosecutor instead... speaking of simon lets go to turnabout storyteller

4. He's rude to Athena

now before i talk about this cae, i'll just say that Dual Destinies is my favourite game in the series, and i was really excited to play as Athena again alongside Blackquill, one of the reasons i was excited for this case was so blackquill could just bully Nahyuta which... he does somewhat but not enough that it's reallly fun but i liked him protecting himself from the beads, but him calling Athena a 'Spring chick' felt really disrespectful to Athena's character, like she may only have a case under her belt but that was still Turnabout Academy which was still a tricky case she really had to work towards catching means, he also denounces the mood matrix and... okay one thing attacjubg y favourite prosector in the series, second disrespecting my favourite lawyer in the series and then saying psychology can't be used to pin down a motive thereby denouncing my favourite gimmick in the series, like i love mood matrix though i am mixed on divination seance as i feel like it's too visual compared to the simplicity of mood matrix

of course i have not fully finished this case but i find Uendo's gimmick really fun with his mutliple personalties but i have not yet played turnabout revouluton so i must move onto my other problems with him

5. His Connection the main characters is WEAK

something i noticed is that all the good prosecutors in this series hae  a connection to the main characters that makes us care about them

1. Edgeworth was Phoenix's childhood best friend which is the entire reason he became a lawyer in the first place though his experience with DL-6 changed him and we see Phoenix and Edgeworth rekindle their friendship in the first game thouhg it doesn't totally recover until Trials and tribulations due to him helping phoenix save maya in farwell my turnabout
2. Fransiska is the daughter of the main villian of the first game: Manfred von karma, who we think is the one she's referring to to get revenge which makes her intimidating from the get-go but we then learn later it's atually Edgeworth she means wanting revenge for phoenix making him leave because she viewed Miles as a little brother and they were like siblings and they did genuinly care about eachother, also Fransiska did become friendlier with Phoenix in Trials in tribulations and were investigating together in Bridge to the turnabout
3. Godot aka Diego Armando was the boyfriend of Mia Fey before he was put into a coma by Dahlia Hawthorne, and he hated Phoenix for being unable to save her, though let Morgan's plan go through so he could save Maya as a way to save her in a way though only so he could get over the guilt of not being able to save mia
4. Klavier is the Younger brother of Kristoph Gavin, who was Apollo's Mentor and culprit of the case before we meet Klavier immeditally giving us a connecton to Klavier, we also learn of his connection to Phoenix's Disbarrment where he was tipped off by Kristoph of the ""falsfied evidence"" that kristoph had forged and planted onto Phoenix which klavier didn't know an
5. Simon Blackquill was the Apprentice of Athena's mother: Metis and was accused of killing her but Athena trained hard in Europe to save him becoming a lawyer in the process

and what does Nahyuta have? now i don't know all the details since i have not played turnabout revoulution, but all i have learned so far is that he... knew Apollo as a child and was his stepbrother which... okay is interesting but i don't know anything about their relationship and why i should care, also his connection to his father: Dhurke is there, but we don't even meet Dhurke until the end of Rite of Turnabotu which is a great moment but means when their connection is revealed it doesnt have the same impact if we knew him, despite Dhurke being shown to be an intimadating guy we learn from Datz in the same scene that he is against the defense culpability act which we just were affected by in the last trial so we actually side with him now. we also learn that Nahyuta wanted to take down the Khurainese regime from within the legal system

ah yes... the same guy who tells you ""you're going to hell"" 24/7 and physically tortures you, ah yes... he's clearly doing a great job as a mole... that's like in the rise of skywalker where >!general Hux is Revealed as a Spy despite him literally saying in the force awakens that all would fall before the first order!<

like that's literally what that feels like but it' not even a twist because DATZ literally tells us about it, like.. how do you  mess that up on the same level as the Sequel trilogy for Star wars... like even i know that and i haven't even watched the sequel trilogy of star wars, but Nahyuta is a genocidal meanie that wants all Defense attorneys dead despite his father being one

i swear... somebody  better animate Hux saying ""ALL SHALL BOW TO THE FIRST ORDER"" then cutting to ""i'm the spy"" with Nahyuta

my final point is 6. His attack animation is stiff

so most of the prosecutors minus Edgeworth and Klavier have an attack animation, though Nahyuta's is very stilted and drawn out. and how i'll prove that is, with all the others it feels like they could do it at any time, like Fransika constantly whips people and it's her main thing that differtiate er from edgeworth, Godot has an infinite supply of coffee so it does feel like he could chuck it at Phoenix at anytime upping the tension even if he doesn't do it, he's alwyas holding coffee in most of his sprites so you know he can at anytime, and Blackquill has his finger swipe that he does once his shackles are broken, the first time he does it is a big suprise though you know from now on that he can do it at anytime he wants. he also has Taka in his arsenal which he can send at the defense, witness' or the judge when he has him, these show that these attacks can command tensions in the courtroom and are some of the most memorable things in the series

of course... Nahyuta's requires him to do an Entire song and dance, and not even the dance of devotion which i can bet you is why the Mood matrix intro is skippable... no, no! first of all, when he puts out his rosary beads  is the same animation he uses for throwing them so it feels underwhelming when he doesn't it feels disappointing, like Godot does the same but at least that's in 2D and is more understandable, but then you have to pan over to phoenix, apollo or athena looking suprised then he has to do his entire khurainese chant before it even constricts, like you know it's coming and it's not a suprise like Fransiska's whip or Godot's coffee throw. and it does look painful but it looks like straigght up torture, like i bet the whip or hot coffee or blackquill's swipe would hurt but it wouldn't be literal torture, like he constricts Phoenix's entire pointing arm, he constricts Athena's Entire bdoy and that makes me upset because i love Athena... and finally he flipping constricts Apollo's head which could probably constrict blood flow to his brain which could KILL him, yeah... i can tell Nahyuta cars about Apollo totatlly...

in conclusion Nahyuta Sadmandhi is the worst part of spirit of justie and i don't think even turnabotu revoulution can redeem him from my thoughts on him now, he is a boring proseuctor who makes Spirit of Justice a worse game for his existence, to be honest i wish Gaspen was the prosecutor because it would be preferable to having to deal with Nahyuta, like i just want him to shut up while the other proseuctors do feel like an actual threat but i at least like them and they have any redeeming qualties unlike Nahyuta...

oh thank the holy mother... at least i still have Investigtions and TGAA after Spirit of Justice, meaning i'll never have to look at Nahyuta again at least those ae considered some of the best...

1plku8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1plku8g/a_year_in_burnout_it_hurts_so_bad/,A year in burnout - it hurts so bad...,"It's been a year and roughly two months now that I've started my sick leave from work. So much had happened in the two years before that. And it had all built up inside me, invisible. 

In the beginning I literally couldn't do anything besides go from my couch to my bed. Maybe go for a short walk. 

Now a year later, I can do so much more. But it's still, so, so little compared to what I could and want to do. To what I feel I should be able to do again someday. 

Yesterday I went out for coffee with a friend, we went to one shop for a birthday gift and after In went to get some groceries. And today... I can't do anything anymore. I did some dishes. And that's it. And this just hurts. I don't know how to explain it to someone else, people don't seem to get it. How little it is and how much it sucks.

I'm sad. I'm bored. I'm overwhelmed. I'm lonely I guess. I just want to hang out with some friends and do silly creative things. Just want to look forward towards Christmas instead of planning for rest, preparing mentally to say sorry, I can't come, again.

1plks09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catonsville/comments/1plks09/people_ask_what_its_really_like_to_live_in/,People ask what it’s really like to live in Catonsville. Here’s the honest version.,"I’ve lived in Catonsville for over 25 years and work here full-time, so this is the non-marketing version of what actually matters if you’re considering it.

Catonsville is best described as a collection of small neighborhoods rather than one uniform town. The experience varies a lot depending on where you land.

The Frederick Road corridor is the most walkable area. You can realistically walk to coffee, restaurants, local shops, and community events. Homes here tend to be older, closer together, and priced higher per square foot because of location, not size.

Move farther from Frederick Road and the town becomes more suburban. Still convenient, still community-oriented, but you are driving most places. This is where many families end up because you get more house and yard for the money.

Housing stock is mostly mid-century colonials, capes, and brick ranchers, with some older homes mixed in near Olde Catonsville. It’s not a place for new construction subdivisions, which is either a positive or a negative depending on taste.

Price-wise, Catonsville tends to sit below Towson and parts of Ellicott City for similar homes, but above more distant Baltimore County suburbs. Buyers who want character, mature trees, and a neighborhood feel usually see the value. Buyers who want everything brand new often look elsewhere.

Commute-wise, it works well for Baltimore, Columbia, and much of central Maryland. DC is doable but not fun five days a week unless you have flexibility or hybrid work. That reality surprises people.

The people who seem happiest here are those who want a real town feel without being trendy or flashy. It’s not Annapolis. It’s not Fells Point. It’s quieter, more practical, and very community-driven.

Downsides: inventory is limited, homes sell quickly in desirable pockets, and some areas are not as walkable as newcomers assume. You need to choose location carefully.

If you value community, access to nature, and a town that feels lived-in rather than curated, Catonsville makes a lot of sense.

1plkoo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1plkoo0/need_legal_advice_college_friend_scammed_me_of_6l/,Need Legal Advice: College Friend Scammed Me of ₹6L + Unpaid Salary,"I am writing this post because I am completely mentally exhausted and angry, and I genuinely don’t know what else to do. I am a fresher from a middle-class family and this situation has completely ruined my peace of mind. I trusted a college friend like family, and that trust has destroyed me financially and emotionally.

I completed my engineering in November 2024 and had a confirmed placement in TCS. During college, I became close to a friend who always spoke very sweetly and confidently. In January 2024, he started telling me that he was building a startup and had already received good funding. He showed big dreams, spoke like a founder, and convinced me that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By February and March 2024, he convinced me to leave my TCS job and join his startup full-time. He promised me the role of Head of IoT with a salary of ₹90,000 per month. Trusting him completely, I left my job offer and joined him.

In April 2024, I started working seriously with him and also began living with him. Around mid-April, I noticed his lifestyle was very comfortable. He used to spend ₹200–₹250 daily on coffee, lived in a house with ₹60,000 rent, and never seemed worried about money. Around the same time, he told me about another manufacturing startup he was starting and said it had strong investors and huge potential. He convinced me that investing in it would secure my future. Trusting him blindly, I borrowed money from my mother and gave him ₹6 lakh in April. There was no written agreement, only verbal promises and trust. Looking back, this was the biggest mistake of my life.

On 1st May 2024, I expected my first salary of ₹90,000. Nothing came. When I asked him, he casually said that there was a small delay and it would be paid along with next month’s salary. I believed him and continued working without any doubt.

June 2024 came, and again on 1st June, no salary was credited. This time I became uncomfortable and asked more seriously. He said funding was about to come, and payments would start soon. He assured me that both May and June salaries would be cleared together. I trusted him again, even though internally I was stressed.

By 1st July 2024, three months had passed and I still hadn’t received a single rupee. When I asked him again, his answers started changing. Sometimes he said there was a technical issue, sometimes he said the investor had delayed the transfer. Still, I kept working because I had already invested my time and left my job.

August 2024 was the breaking point. By 1st August, four full months had passed without salary. ₹3.6 lakh was pending, and I was struggling financially. When I confronted him properly, he avoided the conversation and kept delaying. That’s when I started feeling that something was seriously wrong.

In September 2024, the truth slowly started coming out. I found out that he had taken around ₹5 lakh from other people under different excuses. Some of them were mutual friends. Some people refused to give him money, but many believed him like I did. This made me realize that I was not alone, and this was not just a failed startup situation.

Around the same time, I remembered how he used to repeatedly say that a college professor had invested around ₹18 lakh in his startup. He even showed emails and messages to make it look real. Later, I came to know that the professor had never invested a single penny. He was using a respected professor’s name to build fake credibility. I have witnesses who heard him say this. This realization made me feel cheated and angry beyond words.

In September itself, I demanded my money back firmly. After a lot of pressure, he sent me an email stating that he would refund my entire amount within “60 working days.” Even then, I didn’t trust him, but I had no other option.

In early November 2024, after repeatedly begging him and emotionally breaking down, he finally returned ₹2 lakh. This was not voluntary; it happened only after continuous pressure. Even after that, ₹4 lakh of my investment and ₹3.6 lakh of unpaid salary were still pending.

He promised to pay the remaining amount on 5th November 2024. That date passed with no payment. Then he promised 15th November. Again, nothing. Then on 26th November, he swore on Kali Mata and promised that the money would be paid. Even after swearing, he did not pay a single rupee. Each broken promise increased my anger and helplessness.

In December 2024, the situation became unbearable. He promised payment on 3rd December, and again nothing happened. Now he says he will pay on 15th December. Today is 13th December, and I genuinely feel completely lost. Every date he gives turns out to be a lie, and my anxiety keeps increasing.

He is from Himachal Pradesh and I am from Haryana. I cannot create any social pressure. I am scared of going to court because I am just a fresher and I worry about how legal cases might affect my future job opportunities. At the same time, my mother’s money is stuck, and that guilt is killing me from inside.

On 16th December, I am thinking of approaching my college and informing the professor whose name he used falsely to take money. He took money by claiming association with him, and I feel this is completely wrong and illegal. I don’t know whether this will help me or make things worse, and that confusion is making everything even harder.

I trusted someone who spoke very sweetly and behaved like family, and now I am left with nothing but stress, anger, and fear. I need genuine legal advice on what I can do in India to recover my money without completely destroying my future.

I need to just... say this out loud because it's been bouncing around my head like a pinball since I checked the Play Console last night: *Kaizen - Habit Tracker* somehow crossed **1500 downloads** this week. Three months since launch. But rewind – that's after **eight straight months** of me solo-grinding every damn part: the dev (endless debugging sessions that blurred into dawn), the design (sketches on napkins turning into something that didn't suck), the marketing (cold DMs, Reddit lurks, and way too many ""hey, check this out?"" posts that felt like begging). All by myself, no team, just a laptop on fire and sheer stubbornness. As a 20-something college kid who's supposed to be stressing over finals and cheap tacos, I'm straight-up floored. If you've snagged it, rated it, or hell, even just opened it once and thought ""eh, this is chill"" – thank you. From the bottom of my sleep-deprived soul. You've made something I hacked together feel... real. Like, people are actually using it to nudge themselves through the slog of adulting-lite. If your streak counter is mocking you right now (or worse, celebrating), hit me with that high-five emoji. 🙌

In case you missed the chaos: [Kaizen on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rojins.kaizen&referrer=grok.com). Bare-bones habit thingy, kaizen-style – you know, those Japanese ""one percent better"" vibes without the app turning into a nagging boss. Jot down your routines, watch simple charts show you're not totally failing, link it to your calendar if you want, get reminders that whisper instead of yell. No ads shoving themselves in your face, no ""pro"" unlock begging (though, real talk, feedback on that?). Pre-sets for the basics: wake up without hating life, read a page without scrolling TikTok first, that kinda thing. It's what I needed when I was doom-looping my own bad habits.

The whole story? Man, it's equal parts ""I did that?!"" and ""how am I not fired from life yet.""

* **The dark days:** Those first five months pre-launch? A black hole. Radio silence even from myself some days. 50 downloads in month one post-drop? Felt like pity likes from my group chat. I'd refresh the store page at 3 AM, heart sinking, wondering if the whole minimalist thing was just me being lazy. Offline mode? Who cares? UI too empty? Yeah, probably. Felt like yelling into a void while my laundry piled up.
* **The plot twist:** Then I swallowed my pride and begged for notes on here, X, and those Discord holes where student devs commiserate. One rando comment: ""Share your streaks?"" Dropped that in an update, and suddenly screenshots are flying around. Reviews roll in – ""This doesn't make me feel like garbage for missing a day"" – and poof, we're at 1K+. It's like... users aren't just numbers; they're the spark that kept me from archiving the project. Big lesson: Stop solo-heroing. Ask. Iterate. Repeat.
* **The raw edge:** Those kind words? They land like a gut punch in a good way – validation when you're questioning if coding's even your jam. But the crashes? Notification fails that woke me up sweating? Taught me Android's underbelly the hard way, way better than any textbook. And threading updates through exam hell? It's a tightrope over burnout city. If you're a fellow student dev, trading all-nighters for ""productive procrastination"" – I see you. We're all just winging it with extra coffee.

A few raw takeaways from this solo rollercoaster that I wish someone had tattooed on my forehead early on:

1. **Any launch's biggest value isn't users or revenue. It's feedback.** On our first Reddit drop (kinda like my mini Product Hunt), we got brutal, honest input on features that were fresh for habit apps – like those non-guilt reminders. Some bombed hard, causing instant uninstalls. We axed 'em quick and leaned into what clicked. Now users are DMing me saying it's ""life-changing"" for their routines. That feedback loop kicked in way sooner than if I'd just shipped and ghosted.
2. **Launches open weird doors.** We got shoutouts from a couple indie dev podcasts after my post here went semi-viral in the sub, and suddenly I'm on a Zoom with a group of student hackers who want to collab on habit integrations. Strangers at a campus hackathon walked up like, ""Saw your app on Reddit – let's tweak it for group challenges."" Still pinches me every time.
3. **Talk to users, talk to users, talk to users.** I figured folks would geek out on the charts first. Nope – they cared way more about customizable reminder tones that didn't sound like my grandma's alarm. We'd have wasted weeks building the wrong priorities without those 30-min Discord calls. And I mean *invest* time – not one awkward chat a week, but carving out hours daily to just listen and probe. It's messy, but it's gold.
4. **""Ship fast"" is slightly wrong advice.** Ship fast, sure, but make damn sure it's production-ready. Not some half-baked prototype that craters when a user types a funky habit name with emojis. People shrug off ""coming soon"" features. They bail forever on core stuff that glitches. Learned that the hard way with a reminder bug that had me apologizing in reviews at midnight.

Gratitude's an understatement; it's more like relief mixed with ""don't screw this up"" panic. Huge nod to this sub – the upvotes on my launch ramble, the quiet ASO tips that weren't obvious Google bait. You turned a dorm whim into... this. Next? Dreaming of iOS love (pinching pennies for a MacBook so I can stop Xcode-ing on a borrowed laptop that smells like old pizza – send good juju), and maybe habit showdowns where we all cheer each other's wins. Vent here: What's broken? What'd make it sing? Your streak horror story? I'll read and reply to every damn one, swear on my unfinished thesis.

Look, if you're chasing code dreams or just trying not to ghost your own goals – don't quit on the tiny moves. They sneak up and rewrite your story when you're not looking. What's one you're clinging to these days? Or nuking spectacularly?

*(Quick aside: If it clicked for you, a rating or review? Life-saver for visibility. And mad respect to the kind souls who've flung a Buy Me a Coffee through the app – straight-up carried me through that last all-nighter, turning ""defeated"" into ""determined.""

While r/litrpg loves ""The System"" and ""Stats,"" r/progressionfantasy loves **training, learning, and tangible growth** (weak-to-strong). I have tweaked the pitch to focus on the *mechanics* of the magic and the *scale* of the kingdom-building, which are huge draws for this specific community.

**Post Title:** **\[Self Promo\] Code and Crown: A Kingdom-Building Progression Fantasy where Magic is Source Code (Weak-to-Strong, Rationalist)**

**Post Body:**

Hey r/progressionfantasy,

I’m excited to share my debut novel, **Code and Crown: The Awakening**, which just went live on Amazon (and Kindle Unlimited).

**The Premise:** Adrion was a Systems Architect in Seattle until a runtime error (a massive heart attack) ended his life. He reboots as Nia, a frail noble girl in a medieval fantasy world.

Usually, this is where the MC gets a cheat skill. Nia doesn't. She gets a dying body, a bankrupt estate, and enemies at the gate. But she realizes something the local wizards don't: **Magic isn't mystical. It’s uncompiled code.**

**What makes this Progression Fantasy?**

* **Hard Magic / Coding:** The progression comes from understanding the underlying syntax of reality. Nia treats mana like RAM and spells like scripts. She has to optimize her code to overcome her low mana capacity.
* **Kingdom Building:** The progression isn't just personal power; it's economic and military. Nia uses modern engineering (sanitation, crop rotation, logistics) to turn a mud-soaked village into an industrial fortress.
* **Weak-to-Strong:** Nia starts physically frail and politically powerless. She has to use logic and ruthless optimization to survive against knights, mages, and political rivals.
* **Serious Themes:** This explores the psychological toll of reincarnation and gender dysphoria (a grown man adapting to a young girl's body) as a serious plot point, not a gimmick.

If you like **Rationalist Fiction**, **Technomancy**, and stories where the MC wins by outsmarting the magic system rather than overpowering it, this is for you.

# Prologue: Fatal Exception

The cursor blinked.

That was the only movement in the room. A steady, rhythmic pulse of white against the obsidian void of the Integrated Development Environment. *Blink. Blink. Blink.* It was a hypnotic metronome, counting down the seconds of a life that was rapidly running out of runtime.

I stared at it, my eyes burning as if someone had rubbed crushed glass into them. The dry, gritty sensation was familiar—a constant companion for the last three years of my career at *Nexus Logistics Solutions*. The digital clock in the bottom right corner of my secondary monitor—a glowing red accusation—read **3:47 AM**.

I had been awake for... what? Twenty hours? Twenty-two? The integers were fuzzy, swimming in a sea of lukewarm energy drinks and profound cellular exhaustion. The deployment was due at 8:00 AM sharp. The client, a massive trans-continental shipping firm with more venture capital than common sense, had decided that migrating their entire legacy database over a holiday weekend was a brilliant strategic maneuver.

It wasn't. It was a suicide mission.

The backend migration was a disaster of biblical proportions. It wasn't just bad code; it was a crime scene. I was looking at a tangled mess of spaghetti code, undocumented dependencies, and variable names that looked like someone had smashed their face against a keyboard in a fit of rage. `tempVar1`, `doTheThing`, `pleaseWork`, `dont_touch_this_legacy_garbage`.

I was the only one left in the office—well, my home office in Seattle. The rain lashed against the windowpane, a relentless grey static that matched the fuzz in my brain. My ""team"" had logged off hours ago, citing family commitments or simply ghosting the Slack channel. I was the senior lead. I was the one with the ""ownership mindset."" I was the one who understood enough of the archaic, rusted-out architecture to keep the whole precarious tower from crashing down into the digital abyss.

""Just one more function,"" I muttered, my voice raspy and unused. It sounded like dry autumn leaves scraping over concrete. ""Fix the race condition in the user authentication module, and then... then I can sleep.""

I reached for the can of *Hyper-Volt* on my desk, my fingers trembling slightly. A tremor. That was new. Or maybe it wasn't. Maybe I just hadn't noticed it through the haze of sleep deprivation and the constant, low-level anxiety that hummed in my veins like a faulty power line.

My hand brushed the aluminum can. It was light. Too light. I knocked it over, and it clattered to the hardwood floor, the hollow metallic sound ringing out like a gunshot in the silent apartment. It rolled away, spinning in a slow, mocking circle, leaking the last few drops of neon-yellow chemical sludge onto the floorboards.

I didn't pick it up. I couldn't.

My arm felt heavy, impossibly heavy, as if gravity had suddenly decided to focus all its malice on my right limb. It felt like it was made of lead, encased in wet concrete. A dull ache began to radiate from my shoulder, a cold creeping numbness that defied the stuffy heat of the room.

*Focus, Adrion. Focus. You can sleep when the commit is pushed. You can sleep when the pipeline is green.*

I forced my hand back to the mechanical keyboard. The keys, usually a source of tactile comfort with their crisp *clack-clack-clack*, felt cold and hard under my fingertips. I typed a line of code, each keystroke a monumental effort of will, sending a signal down a nervous system that was rapidly degrading.

`if (user.hasPermission(ADMIN_OVERRIDE)) {`

My chest tightened.

It wasn't a gradual ache. It wasn't the slow burn of heartburn from too much pizza. It was a sharp, sudden squeeze, like a giant, invisible vice clamping down on my ribcage. The air was punched out of my lungs in a violent rush. I gasped, a wet, desperate sound, but no air came back in. My diaphragm had locked up. My fingers froze over the keyboard, hovering over the keys like paralyzed spiders.

The ""developer's crunch"" was a known occupational hazard. We joked about it. *Eat right, exercise, stand up every hour.* I hadn't stood up in six hours. I hadn't eaten a vegetable in three days. But this... this was different. This wasn't anxiety. This wasn't a panic attack.

This was a hardware failure.

The room tilted violently to the left. The glow of the monitors—usually a comforting, cool blue light—smeared into aggressive streaks of neon and blinding white. The hum of my computer fans, usually a white noise I ignored, roared in my ears like a jet engine taking off inside my skull.

*Panic.*

It surged through me, cold and electric, overriding the logic centers of my brain. I tried to stand up, to push my Herman Miller chair back, to reach for my phone on the desk. *Call 911. Call Mom. Call anyone.*

But my legs wouldn't obey. The signal from my brain was lost in transit, severed by the catastrophic failure occurring in my chest. Packet loss: 100%.

I slumped forward. My forehead hit the cool plastic of the keyboard with a dull thud.

`jkl;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;`

The keys clattered under the dead weight of my head, a meaningless stream of characters filling the screen, injecting garbage data into the critical function I was trying to save.

The pain exploded. It wasn't just in my chest anymore. It was a supernova, radiating down my left arm, shooting up into my jaw, exploding behind my eyes. It was a white-hot lance of agony that obliterated thought, obliterated fear, obliterated the deadline.

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. I couldn't exist.

*Is this it?*

The thought was strangely detached, floating above the sea of pain like a solitary lifeboat.

*Am I dying?*

*I didn't finish the migration. The client is going to be furious.*

The absurdity of the thought almost made me laugh, but my diaphragm was paralyzed. I was dying, alone in a dark apartment, and my last regret was uncommitted code for a logistics company that would replace me before my obituary was printed.

Darkness rushed in from the edges of my vision. It wasn't a fading to black; it was a physical presence, a cold, oily tide swallowing the code, the room, the pain. It rushed into my ears, silencing the roar of the fans. It rushed into my mind, erasing the logic, the syntax, the self.

And then, there was nothing.

No light. No sound. No Adrion.

Just the Void.

But in the Void, something flickered.

I saw it. Not with eyes—I didn't have eyes anymore—but with pure, stripped-down consciousness.

A screen.

A massive, translucent interface hovering in the nothingness. It was vast, stretching to infinity, glowing with a harsh, command-line green that reminded me of the old CRT monitors from the 90s.

    **SYSTEM ERROR: UNHANDLED EXCEPTION.**
    **ERROR CODE: 0xDEADDEAD.**
    **ATTEMPTING RECOVERY...**
    

*Recovery?* The concept floated in the void, untethered from language. *Who is recovering? There is no backup. There is no redundancy.*

    **DESTINATION NOT FOUND. REROUTING...**
    **SEARCHING FOR COMPATIBLE HOST...**
    

Lines of code scrolled past at impossible speeds. Hexadecimal strings, memory addresses, soul signatures. It was looking for a variable container that matched my data type.

    **HOST FOUND: NIA_VON_EISENWALD [STATUS: CRITICAL FAILURE]**
    **INITIATING SOUL TRANSFER PROTOCOL...**
    

*Wait. What? Nia? Who is—*

    **TRANSFER COMPLETE.**
    

Thousands of miles away—or perhaps worlds away, across the membrane of reality where the math of the universe breaks down and becomes magic—a garden bloomed.

It was a beautiful day in the Eisenwald. The sun was a warm, golden coin in a sky of perfect azure, a stark contrast to the rainy grey of Seattle. The air smelled of blooming roses, freshly cut grass, and the crisp scent of pine from the nearby mountains.

A girl was running.

She was ten years old, poised on that fragile, gangly threshold between childhood and adolescence. Her hair was the color of spun gold, catching the sunlight as it flew behind her in a tangled wave. She was tall for her age, her limbs long and coltish, clad in a white lace dress that was stained green at the knees—a testament to a tomboyish energy that defied her noble attire.

""Nia! Slow down!"" a woman's voice called from the stone terrace. It was a warm voice, filled with love and a hint of maternal worry.

But Nia didn't listen. She was chasing a butterfly. A magnificent creature with wings of iridescent purple that shimmered like jewels. It danced just out of reach, teasing her, pulling her further across the lawn towards the edge of the woods.

""I'm gonna get you!"" she laughed, her voice clear and bright, losing the high-pitched lisp of early childhood.

She reached out, her fingers long and slender, brushing the air. She was so close. She could almost feel the wind from its wings.

Suddenly, she stopped.

The laughter cut off as if a switch had been flipped on a circuit board.

Her hand flew to her chest, clutching the delicate lace of her dress. Her eyes went wide, the joy replaced instantly by confusion, then a profound, instinctual terror.

She swayed. The world spun around her. The blue sky, the green grass, the purple butterfly—it all blurred into a kaleidoscope of pain and vertigo.

She fell.

She hit the soft grass with a thud. The butterfly fluttered away, unheeded, returning to the safety of the trees.

Her heart, born with a congenital defect no healer in this primitive world had the knowledge to detect, stuttered. It beat once. Twice. A frantic, irregular rhythm, like a bird trapped in a cage.

And then it stopped.

The world went grey for her. The sound of the wind in the trees faded to silence. The warmth of the sun evaporated.

*Mama?* she thought, the word forming in her mind, but the neural pathways required to speak it were already shutting down.

She was gone. The vessel was empty. The lights were on, but the user had logged off.

And then, the blue light crashed down.

It wasn't a gentle light. It wasn't a ray of sunshine. It was a bolt of jagged, neon lightning, a tear in the fabric of the world that smelled of ozone and burnt sugar. It slammed into the still body lying in the grass with the force of a thunderclap.

The air crackled with raw magic and displaced static. The grass around her scorched in a perfect circle, turning to ash in an instant.

The body jerked. A violent, unnatural spasm, like a marionette having its strings yanked by a manic puppeteer.

And then, the eyes opened.

They weren't the soft, sky-blue eyes of a ten-year-old girl anymore. They were wide, terrified, and filled with the cold, hard logic of a man who had just watched his own death.

# Chapter 0x01: Reboot

Pain.

That is the first data point.

It isn't the crushing, explosive pain of the heart attack that ended my previous existence. It isn't the sensation of an elephant sitting on my chest. This is different. It is a dull, throbbing ache that permeates every inch of my being, like the hum of a server room that vibrates in your teeth. My head feels like it is stuffed with wet cotton wool, heavy and disconnected from the rest of me. My limbs feel... wrong. Too light. The leverage is off. The proprioception—the body's internal sense of position in space—is throwing up a cascade of error messages.

*System check,* I think groggily, my internal monologue automatic and detached. *Status report. What is the uptime?*

I try to open my eyes. The lids feel heavy, glued shut with sleep or something stickier. Rheum? Tears?

""Nia! Nia, please!""

The voice is deep, rough with emotion. A man's voice. It sounds terrified, the kind of raw, unfiltered fear that scrapes against the soul. It is too loud, booming in my sensitive ears.

*Who is Nia?*

The name means nothing to me. I am Adrion. I am a developer. I live in apartment 4B. I drive a 2015 Honda Civic. I am... dead?

The memory of the office, the pain, the Void—it all rushes back in a fragmented, terrifying montage. I gasp, my lungs inflating with a sudden, sharp intake of air.

I force my eyes open.

The light is blinding. A harsh, white assault that makes me wince and squeeze them shut again. It isn't the cool artificial glow of my monitors. It is sunlight—raw, unfiltered, aggressive sunlight. I blink rapidly, tears leaking from the corners of my eyes, trying to force the iris to adjust, trying to clear the blur.

A face swims into view.

It is a man. He is close, leaning over me, filling my field of vision. He has a beard, trimmed but thick, the color of dark oak with flecks of grey. Worry lines are etched deep into his forehead, looking like geological strata. His eyes are red-rimmed, swollen, as if he hasn't slept in days.

He is wearing... a tunic?

My brain tries to parse the visual input. It looks like something out of a history book or a high-budget LARP convention. High-quality fabric, dark green velvet that catches the light, with an embroidered collar of silver thread depicting stylized wolves.

""Oh, thank the Gods,"" the man breathes, his shoulders sagging as if a great weight has been lifted. The tension leaves his frame so visibly it is like watching a pressurized valve release. Tears well in his eyes, spilling over onto his cheeks and getting lost in his beard. ""She's awake. Elara! She's awake!""

I try to speak. I want to ask who he is, where I am, why I am not dead at my desk in Seattle. I want to ask for water. I want to ask for a doctor.

""Wha...""

My voice.

It isn't my voice.

It isn't the deep, slightly raspy baritone of a 25-year-old man who smokes too much, drinks too much coffee, and speaks too little.

It is high. Pitchy. Thin. The voice of a child.

I freeze. The panic that has been simmering in my gut boils over, turning into a silent scream that gets stuck in my throat. The heart rate monitor in my brain spikes. I try to sit up, but my body betrays me. I am weak, trembling like a leaf in a storm. The muscles refuse to fire correctly; the strength-to-weight ratio is completely different from what my brain expects.

I look down at my hands, which are resting on the heavy, embroidered quilt.

They are small.

Pale. Soft. Unblemished.

There are no calluses from years of typing. No ink stain on the middle finger from my favorite pen. No small, jagged scar on the thumb from that time I cut myself opening an Amazon package three years ago.

These are not the hands of a software developer. These are the hands of a young girl.

*No.*

*No, no, no. This is a glitch. This is a rendering error.*

I look around, desperate for context, for something familiar to anchor me to reality. I am in a bed, but not my IKEA Malm bed. This is a four-poster monstrosity of dark, polished wood, with heavy velvet curtains tied back with gold tassels. The room is made of stone—actual, quarried stone blocks. The walls are covered in tapestries depicting hunting scenes: stags fleeing from hounds, knights on horseback. A fireplace crackles in the corner, consuming thick logs and casting dancing shadows on the high, beamed ceiling.

There are no monitors. No hum of a server rack. No LED lights blinking in the darkness. No traffic noise from the street below.

""Nia?"" The man reaches out, his large, calloused hand gently cupping my cheek. His skin is rough, like worn leather, but his touch is incredibly gentle, terrified of breaking me. ""Can you hear me, little bird?""

I flinch away from his touch. The action is instinctual, born of pure terror and the violation of personal space.

The man looks hurt, pulling his hand back as if burned. The hope in his eyes fractures. ""Nia?""

""Who..."" I rasp, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. My throat is dry, scratchy, as if I have swallowed a handful of sand. ""Who are you?""

The man's face crumbles. The relief vanishes, replaced by a fresh wave of anguish so potent it is painful to watch. ""Nia... it's me. Papa.""

*Papa?*

My father died ten years ago. Pancreatic cancer. It was slow, painful, and messy. I held his hand when he passed in a sterile hospital room that smelled of antiseptic. This man is a stranger. A cosplaying stranger.

And yet...

Looking at him, a strange sensation washes over me. It isn't a memory, not exactly. It is more like a feeling, a ghost of an emotion that isn't mine. Warmth. Safety. The sensation of being lifted high in the air by strong arms. The smell of pine and old parchment. The scratch of a beard against a soft cheek during a bedtime story.

*Nia.*

The name flashes in my mind like a variable assignment.

`const currentIdentity = ""Nia"";`

I squeeze my eyes shut, pressing the heels of my hands against them until sparks fly. *I'm hallucinating. I'm in a coma. The heart attack didn't kill me; it stroked me out. This is a dream. A very vivid, very messed up dream constructed by a dying brain.*

""Get the healer!"" the man—Papa?—barks at someone I can't see, his voice cracking with authority and fear. ""She's confused. The seizure must have... the fever...""

Seizure? Fever?

I take a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart. The air smells of woodsmoke, lavender, and something medicinal. Poultices. It is too real. Dreams don't smell this distinct. Dreams don't have this level of texture—the scratchiness of the wool blanket, the cold draft hitting my neck.

>

It is absurd. It is statistically impossible. It is the plot of a dozen anime shows I've watched to unwind after a long sprint. *Isekai.* That's what they call it. Trashy power fantasies where the loser protagonist gets hit by a truck and wakes up with a harem.

But I am not a loser protagonist. I am a senior dev. And I don't have a harem; I have a terrified bearded man and a body that feels like it is made of glass.

I open my eyes again. The man is still watching me, fear and hope warring in his expression. He looks like he is waiting for a verdict.

If this is real... if I am really a child named Nia... then Adrion is dead.

The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow to the stomach. My life. My work. My apartment with the view of the Space Needle. My Steam library. My unfinished code. My mother, who will get a call from the police finding my body.

Gone. Deleted. Formatted.

""Nia?""

I look at the man. **Baron Aldric von Eisenwald.**

The name surfaces from the depths of the child's brain I now inhabit, like a file being retrieved from a deep, dusty archive. Along with the name comes metadata: *Father. Protector. Strong. Kind. Eisenwald. Home.*

""I..."" I swallow, forcing the lump in my throat down. I need to play along. If I start screaming about computers and heart attacks and Seattle, they'll think I am possessed. In a medieval setting, ""possessed"" usually means exorcism, which usually means pain, or burning at the stake. I am not keen on dying twice in one week.

""I'm... tired,"" I whisper. It isn't a lie. My new body feels like it is made of lead. The simple act of sitting up has drained a battery I didn't know I had.

Aldric lets out a breath he seems to have been holding for hours. His shoulders slump. ""It's alright. You're safe. You're safe now, my little bird.""

He leans in and kisses my forehead. His beard scratches my skin, a sensation that triggers a confusing mix of revulsion (from Adrion, a grown man being kissed by another man) and comfort (from Nia, a child being comforted by her father).

""Rest. Papa is here. I won't let anything harm you.""

I close my eyes, but sleep is the furthest thing from my mind.

*System Reboot Successful,* I think bitterly. *Welcome to Hell.*

I lie there, listening to the crackle of the fire and the sound of my own breathing—shallow, rapid, terrified. I am a stranger in a strange land, trapped in a body that isn't mine, with a father I don't know, in a world that smells of smoke and unwashed stone.

And I have absolutely no documentation.

I move my hand under the covers, pinching the soft flesh of my thigh. Hard.

It hurts.

*Not a dream.*

I stifle a sob. I am alone. Truly, completely alone. Adrion is gone, and I am just the ghost haunting his replacement.

1plkjn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1plkjn4/el_dorado_seaside_palms_review/,El Dorado Seaside Palms Review,"**El Dorado Seaside Palms**

**TLDR:**
Decent adults-only resort; needs quite a few modern updates. Get multiple towels, eat at the vegan restaurant for lunch, bring playing cards, be wary of pushy/annoying salespeople on the resort.

Went early to mid-December of 2025.

**Intro:**
We didn’t know this when we booked, but the resort accommodations are used by three different resorts with different purposes.

The El Dorado Seaside Palms generally has a more relaxing vibe. The El Dorado Seaside Suites are generally more of a party vibe. The Hidden Beach Resort is a nudist resort—there is no access to this resort for non–Hidden Beach stayers.

**Pros:**
* Staff were friendly; mostly everyone was kind and didn’t make you feel uncomfortable (see Misc section for uncomfortable interactions on the resort and Cons for spa people being super pushy).
* Plenty of bottled water (see Cons for Not Eco Friendly).
* A/C actually worked—been to resorts where the A/C can’t keep up with the heat or humidity. This did; however, we came in December, so probably not the best judge of A/C performance.
* Drinks were good—bartenders were efficient and knew how to make a large variety of drinks.
* Ride to/from the airport was complimentary. We waited 40 minutes outside for the ride, which wasn’t super long. The ride also involved dropping someone else off at their resort. All in all, it took about 1 hour and 40 minutes to get to the resort from the airport. Pick-up was on time and took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get to the airport.
* Excursions and transport to excursions included. We did the snorkeling excursion and it was decently eventful. Only two locations, which isn’t a lot compared to other snorkeling excursions I’ve been on.
* Seating was plentiful (but we came during a dead time at the beginning of December).
* Ocean-view restaurants.
* No wait at restaurants—we went during the slow season, so this is subject to change.
* Fire show—there was a fire show one evening that was really well done.
* The vegan restaurant—practically no one at the resort ate here during lunch, but it had some of the best food, flavor-wise, at the entire resort.
* Very clean—the place was mostly spotless. There were people cleaning or clearing the paths/beaches from sunup to sundown (see Cons for Old Resort).
* Plenty of towels—towels were plentiful and found in bins near all pools and beach areas. Grab two or three towels (see Cons for Sunken-in Beach Chairs).
* NO CHILDREN—the resort was mostly peaceful. As always, adults can be just as loud/obnoxious as children; that didn’t seem to be the case here, as the clientele generally seemed to be on the older side, with about 2/3 being 50+. We stayed on the Palms side, which is generally the more tame side of the resort. They did have a pool on the Palms side that blared music and had drunk people singing karaoke on some evenings, which wasn’t what I was expecting based on the Palms being labeled the “chill side.”
* Resort felt safe—left a bag at our chairs when we went into the ocean. No worries about safety or security, and my smaller partner felt the same.

**Cons:**
* WiFi sucked—thinking of jumping onto a Zoom call for work? Playing online chess? Don’t. The WiFi was more unstable than my 88-year-old grandmother after a summer sangria.
* Spa people are super pushy—one day, the same guy asked five separate times if I wanted a massage and got frustrated with me the last time when I told him to bugger off. I get that you have a job to do, but take a hint.
* Not a large beach—the beach is man-made. The water doesn’t get higher than waist-deep, and there is a barrier preventing you from going further into the ocean. I’d still recommend ocean shoes, as the soles of my feet were pretty cut up.
* Timeshare sales pitch x2 (see Misc section for details).
* Asian restaurant had the same food as the buffet—skip it. 60–70% of what they had on the menu was available at the Seafood Market every night.
* Sunken-in beach chairs—the beach chairs are clearly very old and have been stretched over the course of their use. You were practically lying on three support bars while at the beach. It was a requirement to grab multiple beach towels to dull the pain of having three bars dig into you all day long.
* Old resort—upon our arrival, we received a flyer celebrating their 23rd anniversary, and that makes sense. The resort had areas that were dated and probably hadn’t been renovated in 23 years.
* The resort map is a mess—the resort map could be found on an app called Blue App. This map was mislabeled and clearly not updated. There was a restaurant that had clearly been closed for a while that was still on the map. There was a map marker “48” that didn’t correlate to anything. The resort fitness center was in a completely different building than what the map said. These are just a few of the many examples.
* The resort signage was a mess—as mentioned above, the map on the app was horrible. Think you’re going to find your way around with signs? Think again. There was a sign that pointed to the fitness center in the completely wrong direction. There is also very minimal signage and a general lack of main walkways.
* Not eco-friendly—disposable plastic water bottles were used across the resort instead of refillable water bottles. It’s 2025; do better. They do use reusable plastic/glass cups at the bars.
* Coffee was some of the worst I’ve had at an all-inclusive—if you enjoy black coffee and dynamic coffee flavors, prepare to be disappointed. This is usually a highlight of visiting all-inclusive resorts in Central and South America. The coffee at this resort couldn’t stand on two legs.

**Misc Notes:**
Upon checking in, they upgraded our room when we arrived. We traveled during the slow season, and it was our first time here. I wasn’t sure if this was out of kindness or what came next.

To schedule reservations at the restaurants on the resort grounds (the Mexican, Asian, and Italian), we had to visit our “personal concierge” the next morning after check-in. The concierge’s primary goal was to get you to attend a timeshare sales pitch. Upon arriving to schedule these reservations, we were sold on getting couples massages, which the concierge told us they would give to us half off. Then, we were offered them for free if we attended a timeshare sales pitch. Upon declining multiple times, we then scheduled our restaurant reservations (which, mind you, all the slots they had available were at 9:30, which directly felt like this was due to the fact that we declined the sales pitch).

Upon talking to another couple that was celebrating their anniversary, they were given the same treatment, except instead of couples massages, their free offer was a “romantic candlelit dinner” if they attended the timeshare sales pitch.

While waiting to check out, a man sat down with us and tried to convince us that we needed to get in on some discount program if we were planning on coming back, which was directly related to their timeshare program. After multiple “not interested” responses, he left us alone and we were able to check out. I can empathize that bringing people to the resort during the slow season is how they make more money, but the pushy sales tactics were quite a turn-off and reeked of desperation for us to come back to the resort again.

Based on my experience and conversations with other franchisees, this company shows serious red flags consistent with deceptive franchising practices

They present themselves as a legitimate franchisor and claim membership in the **Philippine Franchise Association (PFA)**. Their sales team is initially very accommodating, professional, and convincing. Like many others, I trusted them, signed a franchise agreement, and paid the required fees.

After payment, we were required to attend a webinar and were given compliance requirements. We were pressured to pay for a “placed order” that we never approved or purchased. When I explained that our funds were allocated to store construction, we were threatened with franchise cancellation if we did not pay within 3 days. Shortly after, we received a termination notice, which forced us to pay under pressure. Communication became extremely poor: messages in group chats went unanswered, calls were ignored, only the sales agent responded and that agent has since resigned. As of now, no one from the company responds.

Our store has not been allowed to open, allegedly due to their “opening lineup.” We were told to wait until 2026, despite already paying franchise fees.

We have been paying store rent for over 7 months with zero income. The company showed no concern despite repeated follow-ups and pleas.

I spoke with other franchisees who could not open their stores for 7-8 months. They only got action after reporting the company to the Philippine Franchise Association. They experienced supply shortages even after opening and eventually gave up due to mounting rental and operational losses.

These issues appear to affect multiple brands under the same company, not just one.

I am sharing this so others will research thoroughly before investing. Please verify claims of association memberships, speak directly to multiple existing franchisees (Facebook page), be cautious of pressure payments and sudden threats, and watch for communication drop-offs after payment. Based on my experience, I strongly advise extreme caution when dealing with them.",1,1765629370.0,u_armane_trishana,0,1.0,False

1plkbmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1plkbmh/aio_for_feeling_like_my_best_friends_new/,AIO for feeling like my best friend’s new girlfriend is overstepping my boundaries?,"I swear I’m losing perspective here, so it’s gonna be a long one. I’ve changed the names for obvious reasons. 

I’m 28F, my best friend Luna (29F) has been dating her girlfriend Riley (27F) for about 9 months now. It’s Luna’s first relationship with a woman and things escalated fast — the classic U-Haul relationship. They’re extremely loving and intense, and honestly I’m genuinely happy she found someone that values her so much. I don’t think Riley is toxic. I don’t think she’s a bad person. Their relationship is beautiful and healthy from what I can see.

But… I feel like I’m drowning in it.

Important context: I’m autistic, so new people take me time, space, and zero pressure. I need to get comfortable at my own pace. But pretty much since day one, I’ve felt this expectation that I MUST instantly get along with Riley because I’m Luna’s best friend, and “if Luna’s happy, I should be happy,” and “we should all be super close.” And that pressure alone already put me on edge.

At the start, Luna would involve me in everything about Riley — telling me constant updates about her life even when it was completely unrelated to our conversations. When we hung out, she’d be on video call with Riley half the time, so Riley even saw me in my pajamas and just woken up when I hadn’t even met her in person. I told Luna I was happy for her and really liked seeing her happy, but I needed our one-on-one friend time to still exist.

And she understood… for about two weeks. And then back to the exact same patterns.

We game online together, and even there, Riley was always sitting right next to her (she doesn’t game btw). Every time I called Luna to talk about something private or personal, Riley was just there. Hovering. Listening. Not actively participating, but present. And I don’t know her well enough to be comfortable with that. I’m always polite and try to mold myself to Riley’s energy so she doesn’t think I don’t like her, but honestly it’s exhausting.

Then Luna started integrating Riley into our whole friend group, which we’ve never done with anyone’s partner. None of us said anything, but all of us felt it.

I talked to Luna again. She understood… for another few weeks. Then same thing again.

Nine months later… nothing has changed

I waited because I kept thinking, “Okay, honeymoon phase eventually ends.”

Except… it hasn’t. At all.

And now it’s gotten to the point where Riley is EVERYWHERE in my life, even indirectly, some examples:

•	On my birthday, Luna posted a photo of us and Riley left a super long, emotional comment like we were lifelong besties.

   

•	I hosted a tiny birthday gathering with only my closest friends. Riley didn’t come (because I didn’t invite her honestly) but still sent the biggest gift and a card saying “thank you for letting me be part of your friend group.” Huh?

•	During my gathering, Luna was texting Riley nonstop, even though they literally live together.

•	Now I feel awkwardly obligated to give Riley a birthday gift even though I barely know her (I know I’m not, but I also know if I don’t I’ll look like a bad person) 

•	Every time Luna and I play games online, Riley is RIGHT THERE, bringing snacks, talking to Luna, inserting herself indirectly into every moment. And I mean ALL the time. 

•	Luna and I had plans one day (we see each other every two weeks) and minutes before, she told me Riley would join for “just 30 minutes because she was nearby.” She was not “nearby.” And they were glued to each other the whole time.

•	Another day, we were grabbing coffee and Riley “accidentally showed up” at the end, and then I found out she came on purpose.

I know these are small things and details and that I’m making it so much bigger than it is but I’m really trying to ignore this but it isn’t working. Like I know if they were bigger issues Luna would notice (or at least I’d hope) but since they’re so small I feel like I’m the only one noticing them and I’m thinking I’m crazy.

And here’s the part that’s messing with my head:

I don’t think Riley is doing this to be controlling or toxic. I actually think it’s because Luna has been handling this whole dynamic poorly. Luna is normally extremely emotionally aware, communicates well, goes to therapy, and we’ve always had a solid friendship. But with this relationship… it feels like she loses herself a bit and completely forgets boundaries.

So my rational brain knows Riley isn’t the problem.

But emotionally? I’m at the point where even hearing Riley’s name irritates me irrationally. I feel invaded, overloaded, and honestly exhausted.

And the cherry on top: Luna and I text everyday, and she mentions Riley in EVERY single text. Even when it’s completely irrelevant. For example instead of saying “Hey, do you want to play something later?” she’ll say “Hey, Riley is going to go and take the trash out so do you want to play?”

And I’m sitting there like… why is this information necessary? It’s like trying to unsubscribe from a newsletter and it just keeps emailing you.

So… Am I Overreacting?

For feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, even though I genuinely like Riley, I’m happy for Luna, and I know the real issue is how Luna is managing things? I want to know some outsider opinions before I talk to Luna (for the third time)

Am I being unreasonable? Or are these actually boundary issues?",8,1765629122.0,AIO,0,1.0,False
1plkb41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1plkb41/aitah_for_leaving_my_disabled_friend/,"AITAH for ""leaving"" my disabled friend?","So. Here’s the deal.

Almost 3 years ago, my best friend at the time (let’s call him Jeff) had a serious car accident. At first we didn’t know if he’s going to survive, but he did. When his condition stabilized, it turned out that because of brain injury, he can’t talk and can’t really control his body. Doctors said, that maybe he can hear and coprehend what is being said to him, so Jeff’s mom encouraged us (his friends) to record voice messages for him. And I was recording them, several times in a week, so he would feel our support and wouldn’t feel lonely.

But a year had passed, and despite the ongoing rehabilitation, Jeff wasn’t getting any better. Around that time, I found my first job and for a three weeks I had a tight schedule because of that. In that three weeks I hadn’t really had time or energy to record these messages. But because I was of a few people that was recording them, Jeff’s mom and Jeff’s girlfriend (let’s call her Abby) reached out to me to remind me, that Jeff would be so grateful if I kept recording them for him.

But I was thinking about this situation for a while. I noticed that after not recording these messages I felt lighter, because every recording felt like opening the wound once again. Additionally, my other problems kept pilling up, and I felt like I needed more space to focus and work on myself, before I would do some „emotional labour” for someone else. I was hesitant to cut myself out of Jeff’s life, because I felt that a true friend wouldn’t do this – „a friend in need is a friend indeed” – and that it would be cruel to just „leave him”. But I also felt hopeless in my current situation and was very unhappy in every possible way.

So I deciced to choose (in my opinion) lesser evil and to cut myself out. I called Jeff’s mom to inform her of my decision. I cried and said that I really can’t do this right now, that it’s not like I’m bored or that I just don’t feel like doing this and that I am very sorry. She was very supporting and said to get better and if I ever want to come back, the door are always open. I felt very grateful for what she said because at first I felt like a villain for choosing me over my friend. It strengthened my decision in this situation.

It might sound ridiculous but I was emotionally drained after that phone call, but I wanted to inform Abby of my decision the same day. I recorded her a voice message, also explaining my reasons of this decision. She replied that she don’t know what to do with this information. I thought „fair, it might come out as a surprise” so I gave her time. Abby messaged me a week later, asking if we can talk. I said yes.

We called on discord. First thing Abby said after the hello was that she was crying for 3 hours after hearing my message, she wasn’t sleeping for 3 nights and she needed an emergency psychologist session because of my message and my decision. Then she said I am a bad friend, a good friend wouldn’t do that, that Jeff would be dissapointed in me, that she understands my reasonings but…. my decision is objectively wrong. I tried to explain my motives in another words but she insisted that she understands but…. „But” was always coming back.

I felt like she was pressuring me to change my decision, so I said „that’s my decision for now, when i get better I think I will want to come back into his life, but right now I have to focus on my mental health”.

Abby said „okay, but I will distance myself from you, because I can’t be close friends with someone who made decision like that”

I said „okay, do what’s best for you”. I didn’t want her near me anaways, if she didn't even want to try to understand me.

 

For context, she was the „mature and understanding” one in the group, at least she was acting like that. 3 months prior to that conversation, she wanted to talk to everybody in our close group to see if anybody has PTSD after Jeff’s accident, so she could help them or suggest a psychologist. 3 weeks prior to that conversation she was encouraging our group to record more messages. And when one of our friends said that it was too much for him emotionally, she said that it’s okay and he can take his time. Sooo her reaction was a hurtful shock for me to be honest. It wasn't and easy decision for me at all, I was feeling like bad guy and it really shook my foundations whether I am a good person or not. And ""leaving"" my best friend after a year of emotional support felt like I'm an a-hole. 

Also, just to clarify, I think I understand why Abby could react like this. I think that my decision came out to her as a surprise. We (me and Abby) were the two that were the most engaged and willing to help Jeff’s mom in this difficult situation. I think that Abby felt like all the weight was on her shoulders and she panicked. So it’s not like I think that she completely went nuts or something. I just think that this conversation could have been handled in a much better way. If she just asked me for help in some way, I would do that in a blink of an eye. But now I won’t propose my help as I feel mistreated by her because I made my own decision. I wouldn’t be mad at Abby, if she just apologized for her words and reaction.

After that conversation we kind of split a little (as she wanted) and I wasn’t really thinking much of it. She didn’t invite me for her birthday, but I felt it was fair since she wanted distance from me. But some time later, one of our friends told me that Abby was talking shit behind my back and tried to sabotage my friendships and cut me out of the group.

In the end this backfired on her, some of our friends turned their backs on her and she’s not as active in our group as she was before. Then Abby asked me if I want to go for a coffee and talk about our situation. I said yes, because I was quietly waiting for that. But she never followed thru. Now Abby’s acting like „the conversation” and shit-talking never happened, and I’m lowkey still waiting for my apology.

But all of this got me thinking…

Was my decision selfish, wrong and harmful for Abby and/or Jeff? Is it selfish of me to expect an apology instead of letting it go? Am I the a-hole? Am I the a-hole friend for ""leaving"" Jeff when he's disabled?",0,1765629072.0,AITAH,7,0.5,False

The wind was whistling through the exterior corridor, carrying with it the gentle rustling of tree branches from the forest stretching behind the motel. The lights hanging at the ends of the hallway were dangling mindlessly, barely making any difference in the quickly decaying daylight. Harris was bent over the railing, staring blankly at the road ahead. He didn't even bother to look at the cars that passed every once in a while, just letting the cold breeze smoke the cigarette between his fingers. After his small fit, him and the Sheriff tried to collect every piece of information that seemed useful from that wretched house. After walking around the lower level for a while, dusting the place for fingerprints and picking up small objects to be sent to the Morgantown PD lab, they gathered their courage to go upstairs. They broke every rule in the book and Harris knew that. But he also started to feel like no one actually cared for it except himself. After witnessing the bloodbath in the kitchen, he felt like he started feeling more at ease for whatever this case could throw at him. And he would have done anything to not have to see that scene anymore.

Luckily, the upstairs looked more normal, judging the circumstances. No red stains or... pieces, that is. Besides the mostly non-existing roof, and the wood poles that lay broken on the bathroom and bedroom floors, the place looked remarkably intact. In the coat that was still hanging to the closet knob in the bedroom he found Dean McConnell's wallet, with ID and money still inside. He also found the small safe tucked away behind the large wood desk, which was untouched. After putting the desk back in its place, Harris checked the leather-bound notebooks that were laying on it. One of them was full of recipes, one contained small mementos, phone numbers of close relatives, passwords and what-not. The third one wouldn't have caught the Deputy's attention normally. After hastily checking a couple of pages, he noticed the tone of the writing was very mundane, and at times the handwriting was barely legible, as if McConnell was talking to himself. Most probably a diary, Harris thought to himself. He then noticed the timestamps. Recent timestamps. The latest entry was on January 29th, which Pineville S.D. estimated as the date the murder happened.

Harris winced when he felt the sudden burning sensation in his fingers. The light in his cigarette was already way past the filter line. He rubbed the butt on the corridor railing and threw it in the standing ashtray beside him, and went inside his room. He took a long look at the state of the place. The rancid, moldy stains on the ceiling, the translucent windows not made so by design, but lack of care, the carpet that he suspected was older than him, and the bedsheets that embodied the very essence of beige. He looked at the notebook on the small metal table by the window. While the rest of the evidence was now probably in the Sheriff's office, Harris insisted he take the diary for further inspection. He checked his wristwatch: too late to phone his wife. And he knew that sleep was a distant wish that couldn't be fulfilled. Not tonight. Not after what he saw. So he sat down at the metal table, and opened the notebook.



January 22nd

Finally, I'm here. Drive to the cabin felt endless, especially once I crossed the county line. Who would have thought there would be so much traffic going to West Virginia in the middle of winter? I appreciate the care that we always had when leaving the cabin, though. Every time we came back everything was in order. I hate the feeling of entering a house that remained unoccupied for longer periods of time. Things tend to be out of order, as if the mere absence of people dirties the place.

As suggested by doctor Rodriguez, I am writing this journal as a way to unload my thoughts and emotions. She suggested that I come here for a few days, write everything that goes through my mind. Or what goes through OUR mind. She didn't specify whether I should address these messages to myself, or imagine that I am talking to someone else. I'll just see where this leads.

Come to think of it, this might be part of the exercise. Maybe writing it the way I feel in the moment and addressing it much the same will help ease these feelings. Anyway, I am pretty tired now, it's been a long day. I'll go fix up the gas tank under the stove and get something going. Bought some essentials down at the grocery store on Main Street, and I'm feeling steak with green peppercorn sauce for tonight. Probably going to go straight to bed afterwards. So bye, journal, I guess?



January 23rd

03:12 AM

I can't fall asleep. I tried to force myself, and even though I feel like my eyes are going to melt away, I can't actually push myself over the edge. I just rolled around in bed for a few hours, struggling between freezing outside of the blanket and sweating profusely under it. I should have brought my laptop, even though doctor Rodriguez convinced me otherwise. She said it would distract me, cloud my thoughts. Cabin never had a TV, at least as far as I know, and only brought one book with me. Not a very good choice, tried reading a few pages, but it doesn't seem my style. So I guess writing is my escapism this night. Decided it might be better to write down the time for each entry in the journal. That way I can keep track of my thoughts. Doc said to let myself flow over the pages. She said to write about day-to-day life, but most importantly to write about what I feel deep down. About what bothers me, what hurts. But it's hard to do it. Never really opened up about these things to anyone. Baby steps, Dean, baby steps.

Tomorrow I'm planning to do some setup around the house. Or today, rather, I forget what time it is. I should unpack my bags, sort out the boiler for the hot water, bring out the wooly blankets from the storage room, setup the kitchen. Planning on improving some recipes that I've been working on for a while. I hope I can add that duck confit with blackcurrant reduction and cedar-infused rosemary to the menu when I get back to the city. But that's a problem for tomorrow. Or today. I'll try to go back to bed.

04:47 AM

I keep thinking about her. I miss her, so much. I know that's normal, but I just can't really accept it. I know it happened, but I don't want that. I don't want it to be true. I just wish I could pinch myself and wake up from this nightmare. I would even try to go to sleep with the hope that through some weird dream logic I could get back to the real world. To wake up next to her, watch her sleep peacefully next to me, like I've watched her so many times before. I don't know how to express it, it just feels like this huge pressure in my chest, and whatever I do, it just doesn't go away. I go to the restaurant and drown myself in work, trying as much as possible to avoid going back home. I stopped video calling my mom because of the fear of seeing her look at me with those sorrowful eyes. I just wait for her to check up on me, and I am tired of hearing the pity in her voice when she asks me how I'm feeling, knowing fully well how I'm feeling. I go shopping for ingredients and try to smile back to the cashiers, but it just doesn't work. I know this might seem like the weirdest thing to pinpoint, but it feels so weird right now. It is such a natural thing, smiling. Pretending to be happy, to be content. I feel like I can't even pretend anymore.

I never would have believed I would end up here. Even when the doctors told us the diagnosis, I couldn't even imagine. In my head, the plan was simple. Lots of TLC. She would take the sick leave, I can support the both of us. A bunch of procedures, X-rays and what-not, until the chemo started. Even when it was close to the end, and I was standing on the edge of that hospital bed, holding her feeble hand, watching the color drift from her face over the days. I still had all the hope in the world, because even in those moments she would smile, tell me that she is feeling somewhat better, and that she loves me. She always was the more optimistic of the two of us. She was weak, yes, but didn't it work like that? The treatment attacks the tumor, but it also attacks the rest of the body. And then everything will be fine. Right? When it finally happened, I wasn't even fully aware of it. The doctor warned me that the treatment wasn't really working to plan, and that the disease was most likely spreading again. But during the day-to-day trips she seemed... okay. She was moving more, talking more. She wasn't eating, she said the chemo was killing her appetite. She tried having a few mouthfuls of the food I brought with me from the restaurant. She said she could never pass on my ragu. I couldn't, or wouldn't, recognize the light that was slowly fading from her eyes as the weeks dragged on. In the very end, I think she just let go. Gave up. Whenever I close my eyes at night, I picture her in that final moment. Her green eyes, so full of joy and candor, now turned dull. Her face thinner, her almost transparent skin wrapped tightly around her cheeks. She pressed on my hand to tell me to get closer. She could barely even whisper. I still don't know what those few last words said, before she closed her eyes.

08:03 PM

Cooked the duck. Still not there yet, sauce is too sweet, needs more acidity. Shouldn't put lemon though, maybe I can try a bit of balsamic. As you can see, I didn't really have time for writing today. Or, as I can see. Still not sure how to address this. Did a bunch of stuff around the house, and after I was done with the prep work for the recipe I really felt like having a break. Went for a walk down the holler, almost reached the old Company Store before it started getting dark. Got back up the moment I saw the light dimming. No electrical lighting on the holler, and I don't really want to take the chances of getting face-to-face with a wolf.

Last night I fell asleep writing, basically passed out. Woke up around 11:00 AM, feeling even more tired. But I couldn't sleep anymore, my back was hurting again.

I found the old radio while looking through the living room cupboards, I completely forgot about this. It was nice having something to listen to while cooking, even if there are only two stations available and one of them is mostly static. Hopefully it will help me feel less lonely these days.

I should probably head to bed now, it's been a long day, and I feel like I will have more luck with the sleep tonight.



January 24th

09:00 AM

Was right about the sleep. Most restful night I've had in the past few months. Found a half-full bottle of maple syrup while looking for the coffee pot. Going to whip up some pancake batter and fry some bacon in its honor.

03:24 PM

Just got back from town. Had to pick up a few things for the carbonara tonight. Pineville isn't really known for its guanciale, but I guess some garlic cured ham will do. No Italians around here to judge. Also met Otis, the Deputy. He told me there was a blizzard warning, supposedly it will hit tonight. He asked if I wanted to get a room at the motel, on the house, but it's more comfortable here. After the talk with him, I went back to the grocery store to double down on the food and household supplies. Now I have enough toilet paper and batteries to last a full winter.

10:47 PM

Well, Otis was right about the blizzard. It's hailing ass outside, and the wind beating against the side of the house is almost deafening when staying in the kitchen. It's weirdly calm, though. The whirring and beating sounds help muffle my thoughts. I'll do some reading before going to bed.



January 25th

06:22 AM

Just got done talking to Otis, he wanted to see if I was ok. Called the police last night, something weird happened. Most probably some punk kids snuck around the cabin, trying to scare me. I was downstairs in the kitchen. Even though the blizzard is still ongoing, there was a timeframe of about one hour when the wind was more gentle, and I could see the thick snowflakes landing more peacefully in the total darkness outside. At some point, I heard some ruffling outside. I turned off the radio and got up, put my ear against the wall, pretty close to the front door. I didn't hear anything for a few moments, but then it came again. I was pretty sure it sounded like footsteps.

I peeked through the curtains of the kitchen window, but couldn't see anything. I waited a couple of minutes, but couldn't hear anything else, so I turned the radio on again, went back to the crossword puzzle I had laying on the table. It's quite weird when you are focused on something, and then you pull back from it, even for a split-second, you realize that some things you were internalizing as being part of your own mind are coming from outside. That's what happened to me after I looked up from the puzzle, considering if I should pour a glass of wine. I realized that a specific rhythmical beat that I was hearing was not coming from the song on the radio. There was beating on the cabin's wall. \*Bang\* and then a moment of silence, followed by another \*bang\*. It was the sound of something small, but hard, hitting wood. I turned the radio down. The sound came again.

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

These mountains are full of wolves, bears, deer and other game meat. But they don't usually venture close to towns, even the more isolated hollers, like this one. Never heard of a bear beating on a house trying to get in around here. And they for sure cannot maintain a rhythm like this. There was a person outside of my house.

I listened for a few more seconds. I didn't turn off the radio, I didn't want to let the intruder know I was aware of their presence. And I realized the beating was now coming from the kitchen wall, and was slowly making its way towards the front of the house. As it turned the corner, the beating picked up the pace, just a bit. Just barely perceptible. There was a \*bang\* every few inches along the wall, and I was following it, pacing carefully to not let the floorboards creak beneath me. The moment the beating reached the window to the left of the front door, it took a brief pause before resuming on its other side. What I thought was weird in that moment, what I still think is weird, is that I couldn't see any shape or shadow in that moment. The curtains here are pretty thin, and normally you would be able to see the shape of another person walking outside, even at night.

\*bang\*

The door resounded.

\*bang\*

I could feel a slight increase to the force of the knock.

\*bang\*

I walked up to the door and carefully lifted the visor. I couldn't see anything, too dark. I should have left the porch light on. Or maybe the person knocking was crouched beneath the visor.

\*bang\*

I could feel the force of the knock at the height of my chest. Without realizing it, I knocked back.

There was a pause, and then it came.

\*bang\*

I hit again.

\*bang\*

\*bang\*

I knocked harder.

\*bang bang bang\*

\*bang bang bang\*

I thought the guy must be mocking me. I yelled ""Hey! Stop that!"".

The knocking stopped. I put my ear against the door. I waited for what felt like a good few minutes. And then

""Hey!""

The voice on the other side was quite high. Sounded clean, but somehow unsure. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

""Hey!"" it sounded a bit deeper, a bit more raspy than before. ""What do you mean hey? I asked who are you!"" I yelled back. ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" I could hear the three words coming from different sides of the door. There wasn't just one guy.

""Get out of here, before I call the police!""

""Stop that!"" said one of the voices.

""Hey! Get out of here!"" said another.

Those guys must have been crazy or something. There was a barrage of sounds coming from the other side of the door, and the knocks resumed, now even more intense. I could barely hear Sheriff Waylon's voice on the other side of the phone while I asked for a house call. My mind was filled with those voices.

Hey! \*bang\* Get out of here! Hey! Stop! Get out of here! Police! \*bang\* Stop that! Hey! \*bang\* Get out of that! Call the police! I call! Stop! \*bang\* Hey! Get here! Out! \*bang\* Call the police! \*bang\* Hey! Hey! Hey!

The voices stopped soon after I finished the call. I ran upstairs and took the gun from the safe. Locked myself in the bedroom, and hid behind the desk, gun ready. At times, I could hear some sounds outside. What must have been footsteps, followed by the occasional ""Hey!"". What really shook me, however, was that they sounded remarkably similar to my voice now. Not the way you hear your voice in your own head, but the way you hear it on a recording somewhere, and you get disappointed because it never sounds the way you think it sounds, the way you want it to sound.   

Hey! Hey! Hey!

\*bang bang bang bang bang\*

The hard knocks woke me up from the trance I slipped myself into. They sounded tougher, more determined than even the ones before.

""Hey! Dean, you in there?""

I opened the bedroom door and crept down the stairs, looking around the house for any intruders.

""Dean! It's Otis Bailey from the Sheriff's Department! Are you in there?""

I could see the red-blue flashes of a police car peering through the curtains. Looked through the visor on the front door to see the figure of Otis standing on the other side.

Those intruders left before Otis got here, at least from what he told me. He took a good look around the house before knocking on my door. He saw some footprints around the house, which he showed me. There were indeed multiple sets of indents in the snow, circling the house back and forth, but the blizzard started picking up, and the wind was starting to cover the prints with snow. However, Otis pointed out that there was at least one set of prints leading away from the house, up the holler towards the old mine. Told him everything that happened. He assured me it must have been some kids, trying to prank me. I asked how can there be kids out in this kind of weather. He just shrugged. He asked again whether I want to go to the motel in town, but I refused. Apparently the blizzard will keep going for another few days.

Anyways, I'm pretty tired now, and could really go for some food. I'll get started on some breakfast.

12:15 PM

I hate this snow. It's been snowing non-stop for the past couple of hours. It's so cold that I can't even ventilate the place properly. I can only open the windows for a couple of minutes at a time before feeling like I'm freezing. It's especially bad after I cook, and I'm trying to get the smell out of the kitchen and living room. Kate asked me to fix the vent hood last year, when we noticed it wasn't pulling it's weight while frying some sausages. Should have done it then. No way I can fix it now.

02:34 PM

I'm starting to get really bored in here. Maybe I should have taken Otis' offer of driving me to the motel. At least I would be closer to everything else. At least I would get to go to a shop to see some people. It's very lonely being by yourself in the heart of the mountains here. Guess I never noticed it. I always came here with Kate, and it was the perfect getaway after months of work and busy schedules. We could come here, just the two of us, as a sort of romantic escape. No people, no responsibilities, just us.

11:17 PM

I spent the last few hours finishing the book I took here with me. Bought it a couple of years ago, when I went to a bookstore in Chicago with Kate. She told me it was her favorite book. I've never been much into horror myself. Read some Lovecraft and King in my sophomore year in high school, my friends were really into slasher movies and the likes. This one was really nice, though, especially the second half. I guess I like cosmic horror more than I thought. I predict that I'll have the image of an old, scrappy-looking wizard trying to fish out a leviathan out of a creek etched into my mind for a long time.

Had quite a lot of wine for dinner, I think I'm going to call it a night.



January 26th

04:15 AM

I just saw Kate in the house.

Of course, I didn't actually see her. It's just that I had the most vivid dream ever. I woke up to get a glass of water from the bathroom, and when I opened the bedroom door I saw her, standing there in the darkness of the corridor, her back towards me. I could see her figure pretty well in the silver moonlight protruding from the window. Her hair was tied in a loose bun, as she usually wore it around the house, and I could see she was wearing the earrings I got her for our first anniversary. She refused to wear any other ones. She said it helped her hear our hearts beating even when we were apart. She always was good with words, had a way of making my heart melt with every compliment.

I could see her hands moving by her side. She was slowly flexing and relaxing her fingers, as if her palms fell asleep. She was testing every finger, going back and forth between them. In that dreamy haze, I called out to her. ""Hey..."" that's all I could think of. I never dreamt of her after what happened. I guess it was a way for my brain to give me a bit of peace, at least while I was sleeping. I could see Kate stiffing her neck, but otherwise didn't move. A few moments later, I heard her respond in my own voice ""Hey!"". Next thing I know, she darted down the corridor into the small storage space next to the bathroom. At the same time, I drunkenly limped back into the bedroom and fell into the bed. At the same time, I woke up, sweating, heart pounding. I just started calming down. Don't think I can fall back asleep though.

08:32 AM

Indeed, couldn't fall asleep again. Still thinking about the dream I had. I guess I didn't want to let the rest of a night's sleep wash away the memory. Despite the almost disturbing setup of the dream, I am happy I can dream of her again. I spent the last few hours thinking of her, of us. Too much to put onto paper. I remember, during one of the first therapy sessions with doctor Rodriguez, she asked me if I could pick one memory of Kate that I loved the most. At that time, I told the doc that I couldn't possibly pick just one memory, that I would take any memory with her, be it good or bad, if that meant I could experience it with her.

Now, I think I finally chose a memory. When we were still quite young, when we had just moved from being friends to a full-on relationship, Kate invited me over to watch a movie at her place. We both laid down on the bed, blankets and stuffed animals all around us. We were stuffed from the homemade burgers we had cooked together. We flipped over the channels, until we landed on an Italian movie. At least as far as I remember, it was Italian. The movie depicted a first date between two people. The intriguing part, though, was that besides the date itself, the movie also showed the dialogues between each person's internal voices, as they were making decisions, thinking about the other person, and so on. The movie was pretty good, and we laughed a lot. I spilled red wine on Kate's bed, and I still hope she forgives me for that, but all-in-all we had a really good time. Even though the movie was a decent comedy, the discussion slipped into a somber analysis of the concept and inner workings of relationships. At that time, Kate was quite a bit more pessimistic than me. Stressful times, being a college student. But I still remember, clear as day, as she looked up at me and said ""It's sad when you think about it. Us, people, being so different from each-other, we are basically incompatible."" After I asked why is that, she said ""Because think about it: people are such evil creatures at their core. If relationships were such a natural thing, then why do you see so much abuse, so many broken marriages, so much suffering all around?"" I think I responded something among the lines of ""Because we are social creatures, and we need one another in the end.""

I kept thinking about that moment every now and then. I think about the certainty of human despise and the uncertainty on the world that reflected in her eyes at that time. And then I think about all the good times we had. I think about every joke that ever made her laugh. About all the places we've been to, and the curiosity and fascination she showed experiencing new cultures together. All the late-night talks about nothing and everything at the same time. All the times we cooked together, dancing to the music in the radio while flipping pans and mixing ingredients. All the times we hanged out with friends, and the knowing looks we gave each-other when we noticed something funny. All the silent moments, with her in my arms, slowly drifting to sleep. And I hope that I helped change her mind. I hope that I made her happy.

11:57 PM

Those damn pranksters came back again. They're knocking on the windows and the door. I think they recorded my voice the other night, they keep yelling in what sounds like my voice. Currently I locked myself in the bedroom, waiting to see if they go away.

11:57 PM

They keep at it. I'm gonna call the police.

11:57 PM

Fucking hell, the phone line must be messed up. Called a few times. The call went through only once, and I could barely distinguish what the dispatch guy was saying.

11:57 PM

This can't be happening!!! This can't be happening!!!

Relax, Dean, it will be fine. You have a gun, the door is locked and the police should be on their way. Any moment now.

11:57 PM

Shit, I think they broke in! I can hear footsteps in the house.

11:57 PM

What the fuck is going on? There is constant knocking on my door. It's too fast, I don't see how anyone could knock on a door that quick. After every burst of knocking, they are calling for me to come outside. It still sounds like my voice. Just what on Earth is happening?

11:57 PM

I can't do it anymore. They must have been going on for hours at this point. I hear rapid footsteps down the corridor, going to the bathroom. Then it comes back, just as fast, followed by bursts of knockings. After each knocking, the voice changes.

It drives me fucking nuts! How can it be?! At some point it sounded like Otis, but I know it can't be him. I would have heard his car come up the driveway, surely. Then it sounds like my mother, and doctor Rodriguez, and my friend Jeremy, and AND AND AND AND.

11:57 PM

I saw one out of the window. It got down on four legs and ran towards the house. It had a mocking imitation of clothing on, morphed to its skeletal body. It looked like a pitiful imitation of us. What the hell are these things? And why did it look like Otis?

11:57 PM

The knocking is getting so hard right now. I can hear them on the roof, trampling. They are trying to get in. They are trying to convince me to come outside. I don't think the cops are coming anymore. They are close to breaking the door down. They have Kate's voice.



January 27th

08:14 AM

Had some cereal this morning, about to head out to fix a leak in the roof, above the porch. It's been driving me crazy these past few nights.

19:03 PM

This day was productive, at least I'm happy about that. Still pretty boring out here. The snow completely covers the road up the holler. But at least the blizzard seems to be over. In a couple of days, I hope they can send the ploughs over here.



January 35th

01:06 AM

No updates, everything is fine at the cabin. Excited to go back into town!

15:89 AM

Must be really nice weather in New York now! I really miss Kate. Can't wait to see her again.

14:11 PM

I remember that time we used to go down to the creek. There was an old coal refinery down there. Remember when we would go down there? We were sitting on the edge of the water, skipping stones. You never were that skilled at it. But you liked seeing the miners work. Would you like to go there again?



January 29th

00:13 PM

Hey! It's Dean McConnell again. Sorry about that.

Everything is fine now. It's a bit warm in the house, a bit concerned for the state of the wood. But at least I got the radio back on. So many new things there. Such educational material. And such interesting voices.



5.

Deputy Harlan Harris leaned back in the creaky desk chair. He looked visibly tired. He read and re-read Dean's notebook since arriving at the Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Thompson was kind enough to provide him with a desk near the far end of the precinct, and Harris' back was hurting from sitting down so long. He got up and lit a cigarette, trying to piece together the information.

Dean sounded like he was in a lot of torment, and his handwriting slowly became more unclear as the pages progressed. He talked about someone harassing him, maybe pranking him, but the later entries point to something far more extreme. Dean thought he wasn't tormented by people by the end of it, he thought he was tormented by creatures. He also mentioned Otis Bailey, Sheriff Thompson's Deputy. He thought one of those creatures looked like Otis. Could it have been Otis? No one saw him since the ordeal, as far as the APB put out was concerned.

Harris thought Dean might have lost his mind halfway during his stay at the cabin, due to the loneliness and emotional turmoil he went through. But still, there must be a way to uncover the truth. He walked away from the desk, his boots hitting the marble floor. As he turned the corner, he saw a fleeting shape sliding into the Sheriff's office. Even though he only saw the person with the corner of his eye, Harris recognized the colors as that of Pineville S.D. A few moments later, as he was walking, he heard Sheriff Thompson's voice booming from his office.

The wind was whistling through the exterior corridor, carrying with it the gentle rustling of tree branches from the forest stretching behind the motel. The lights hanging at the ends of the hallway were dangling mindlessly, barely making any difference in the quickly decaying daylight. Harris was bent over the railing, staring blankly at the road ahead. He didn't even bother to look at the cars that passed every once in a while, just letting the cold breeze smoke the cigarette between his fingers. After his small fit, him and the Sheriff tried to collect every piece of information that seemed useful from that wretched house. After walking around the lower level for a while, dusting the place for fingerprints and picking up small objects to be sent to the Morgantown PD lab, they gathered their courage to go upstairs. They broke every rule in the book and Harris knew that. But he also started to feel like no one actually cared for it except himself. After witnessing the bloodbath in the kitchen, he felt like he started feeling more at ease for whatever this case could throw at him. And he would have done anything to not have to see that scene anymore.

Luckily, the upstairs looked more normal, judging the circumstances. No red stains or... pieces, that is. Besides the mostly non-existing roof, and the wood poles that lay broken on the bathroom and bedroom floors, the place looked remarkably intact. In the coat that was still hanging to the closet knob in the bedroom he found Dean McConnell's wallet, with ID and money still inside. He also found the small safe tucked away behind the large wood desk, which was untouched. After putting the desk back in its place, Harris checked the leather-bound notebooks that were laying on it. One of them was full of recipes, one contained small mementos, phone numbers of close relatives, passwords and what-not. The third one wouldn't have caught the Deputy's attention normally. After hastily checking a couple of pages, he noticed the tone of the writing was very mundane, and at times the handwriting was barely legible, as if McConnell was talking to himself. Most probably a diary, Harris thought to himself. He then noticed the timestamps. Recent timestamps. The latest entry was on January 29th, which Pineville S.D. estimated as the date the murder happened.

Harris winced when he felt the sudden burning sensation in his fingers. The light in his cigarette was already way past the filter line. He rubbed the butt on the corridor railing and threw it in the standing ashtray beside him, and went inside his room. He took a long look at the state of the place. The rancid, moldy stains on the ceiling, the translucent windows not made so by design, but lack of care, the carpet that he suspected was older than him, and the bedsheets that embodied the very essence of beige. He looked at the notebook on the small metal table by the window. While the rest of the evidence was now probably in the Sheriff's office, Harris insisted he take the diary for further inspection. He checked his wristwatch: too late to phone his wife. And he knew that sleep was a distant wish that couldn't be fulfilled. Not tonight. Not after what he saw. So he sat down at the metal table, and opened the notebook.



January 22nd

Finally, I'm here. Drive to the cabin felt endless, especially once I crossed the county line. Who would have thought there would be so much traffic going to West Virginia in the middle of winter? I appreciate the care that we always had when leaving the cabin, though. Every time we came back everything was in order. I hate the feeling of entering a house that remained unoccupied for longer periods of time. Things tend to be out of order, as if the mere absence of people dirties the place.

As suggested by doctor Rodriguez, I am writing this journal as a way to unload my thoughts and emotions. She suggested that I come here for a few days, write everything that goes through my mind. Or what goes through OUR mind. She didn't specify whether I should address these messages to myself, or imagine that I am talking to someone else. I'll just see where this leads.

Come to think of it, this might be part of the exercise. Maybe writing it the way I feel in the moment and addressing it much the same will help ease these feelings. Anyway, I am pretty tired now, it's been a long day. I'll go fix up the gas tank under the stove and get something going. Bought some essentials down at the grocery store on Main Street, and I'm feeling steak with green peppercorn sauce for tonight. Probably going to go straight to bed afterwards. So bye, journal, I guess?



January 23rd

03:12 AM

I can't fall asleep. I tried to force myself, and even though I feel like my eyes are going to melt away, I can't actually push myself over the edge. I just rolled around in bed for a few hours, struggling between freezing outside of the blanket and sweating profusely under it. I should have brought my laptop, even though doctor Rodriguez convinced me otherwise. She said it would distract me, cloud my thoughts. Cabin never had a TV, at least as far as I know, and only brought one book with me. Not a very good choice, tried reading a few pages, but it doesn't seem my style. So I guess writing is my escapism this night. Decided it might be better to write down the time for each entry in the journal. That way I can keep track of my thoughts. Doc said to let myself flow over the pages. She said to write about day-to-day life, but most importantly to write about what I feel deep down. About what bothers me, what hurts. But it's hard to do it. Never really opened up about these things to anyone. Baby steps, Dean, baby steps.

Tomorrow I'm planning to do some setup around the house. Or today, rather, I forget what time it is. I should unpack my bags, sort out the boiler for the hot water, bring out the wooly blankets from the storage room, setup the kitchen. Planning on improving some recipes that I've been working on for a while. I hope I can add that duck confit with blackcurrant reduction and cedar-infused rosemary to the menu when I get back to the city. But that's a problem for tomorrow. Or today. I'll try to go back to bed.

04:47 AM

I keep thinking about her. I miss her, so much. I know that's normal, but I just can't really accept it. I know it happened, but I don't want that. I don't want it to be true. I just wish I could pinch myself and wake up from this nightmare. I would even try to go to sleep with the hope that through some weird dream logic I could get back to the real world. To wake up next to her, watch her sleep peacefully next to me, like I've watched her so many times before. I don't know how to express it, it just feels like this huge pressure in my chest, and whatever I do, it just doesn't go away. I go to the restaurant and drown myself in work, trying as much as possible to avoid going back home. I stopped video calling my mom because of the fear of seeing her look at me with those sorrowful eyes. I just wait for her to check up on me, and I am tired of hearing the pity in her voice when she asks me how I'm feeling, knowing fully well how I'm feeling. I go shopping for ingredients and try to smile back to the cashiers, but it just doesn't work. I know this might seem like the weirdest thing to pinpoint, but it feels so weird right now. It is such a natural thing, smiling. Pretending to be happy, to be content. I feel like I can't even pretend anymore.

I never would have believed I would end up here. Even when the doctors told us the diagnosis, I couldn't even imagine. In my head, the plan was simple. Lots of TLC. She would take the sick leave, I can support the both of us. A bunch of procedures, X-rays and what-not, until the chemo started. Even when it was close to the end, and I was standing on the edge of that hospital bed, holding her feeble hand, watching the color drift from her face over the days. I still had all the hope in the world, because even in those moments she would smile, tell me that she is feeling somewhat better, and that she loves me. She always was the more optimistic of the two of us. She was weak, yes, but didn't it work like that? The treatment attacks the tumor, but it also attacks the rest of the body. And then everything will be fine. Right? When it finally happened, I wasn't even fully aware of it. The doctor warned me that the treatment wasn't really working to plan, and that the disease was most likely spreading again. But during the day-to-day trips she seemed... okay. She was moving more, talking more. She wasn't eating, she said the chemo was killing her appetite. She tried having a few mouthfuls of the food I brought with me from the restaurant. She said she could never pass on my ragu. I couldn't, or wouldn't, recognize the light that was slowly fading from her eyes as the weeks dragged on. In the very end, I think she just let go. Gave up. Whenever I close my eyes at night, I picture her in that final moment. Her green eyes, so full of joy and candor, now turned dull. Her face thinner, her almost transparent skin wrapped tightly around her cheeks. She pressed on my hand to tell me to get closer. She could barely even whisper. I still don't know what those few last words said, before she closed her eyes.

08:03 PM

Cooked the duck. Still not there yet, sauce is too sweet, needs more acidity. Shouldn't put lemon though, maybe I can try a bit of balsamic. As you can see, I didn't really have time for writing today. Or, as I can see. Still not sure how to address this. Did a bunch of stuff around the house, and after I was done with the prep work for the recipe I really felt like having a break. Went for a walk down the holler, almost reached the old Company Store before it started getting dark. Got back up the moment I saw the light dimming. No electrical lighting on the holler, and I don't really want to take the chances of getting face-to-face with a wolf.

Last night I fell asleep writing, basically passed out. Woke up around 11:00 AM, feeling even more tired. But I couldn't sleep anymore, my back was hurting again.

I found the old radio while looking through the living room cupboards, I completely forgot about this. It was nice having something to listen to while cooking, even if there are only two stations available and one of them is mostly static. Hopefully it will help me feel less lonely these days.

I should probably head to bed now, it's been a long day, and I feel like I will have more luck with the sleep tonight.



January 24th

09:00 AM

Was right about the sleep. Most restful night I've had in the past few months. Found a half-full bottle of maple syrup while looking for the coffee pot. Going to whip up some pancake batter and fry some bacon in its honor.

03:24 PM

Just got back from town. Had to pick up a few things for the carbonara tonight. Pineville isn't really known for its guanciale, but I guess some garlic cured ham will do. No Italians around here to judge. Also met Otis, the Deputy. He told me there was a blizzard warning, supposedly it will hit tonight. He asked if I wanted to get a room at the motel, on the house, but it's more comfortable here. After the talk with him, I went back to the grocery store to double down on the food and household supplies. Now I have enough toilet paper and batteries to last a full winter.

10:47 PM

Well, Otis was right about the blizzard. It's hailing ass outside, and the wind beating against the side of the house is almost deafening when staying in the kitchen. It's weirdly calm, though. The whirring and beating sounds help muffle my thoughts. I'll do some reading before going to bed.



January 25th

06:22 AM

Just got done talking to Otis, he wanted to see if I was ok. Called the police last night, something weird happened. Most probably some punk kids snuck around the cabin, trying to scare me. I was downstairs in the kitchen. Even though the blizzard is still ongoing, there was a timeframe of about one hour when the wind was more gentle, and I could see the thick snowflakes landing more peacefully in the total darkness outside. At some point, I heard some ruffling outside. I turned off the radio and got up, put my ear against the wall, pretty close to the front door. I didn't hear anything for a few moments, but then it came again. I was pretty sure it sounded like footsteps.

I peeked through the curtains of the kitchen window, but couldn't see anything. I waited a couple of minutes, but couldn't hear anything else, so I turned the radio on again, went back to the crossword puzzle I had laying on the table. It's quite weird when you are focused on something, and then you pull back from it, even for a split-second, you realize that some things you were internalizing as being part of your own mind are coming from outside. That's what happened to me after I looked up from the puzzle, considering if I should pour a glass of wine. I realized that a specific rhythmical beat that I was hearing was not coming from the song on the radio. There was beating on the cabin's wall. \*Bang\* and then a moment of silence, followed by another \*bang\*. It was the sound of something small, but hard, hitting wood. I turned the radio down. The sound came again.

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

These mountains are full of wolves, bears, deer and other game meat. But they don't usually venture close to towns, even the more isolated hollers, like this one. Never heard of a bear beating on a house trying to get in around here. And they for sure cannot maintain a rhythm like this. There was a person outside of my house.

I listened for a few more seconds. I didn't turn off the radio, I didn't want to let the intruder know I was aware of their presence. And I realized the beating was now coming from the kitchen wall, and was slowly making its way towards the front of the house. As it turned the corner, the beating picked up the pace, just a bit. Just barely perceptible. There was a \*bang\* every few inches along the wall, and I was following it, pacing carefully to not let the floorboards creak beneath me. The moment the beating reached the window to the left of the front door, it took a brief pause before resuming on its other side. What I thought was weird in that moment, what I still think is weird, is that I couldn't see any shape or shadow in that moment. The curtains here are pretty thin, and normally you would be able to see the shape of another person walking outside, even at night.

\*bang\*

The door resounded.

\*bang\*

I could feel a slight increase to the force of the knock.

\*bang\*

I walked up to the door and carefully lifted the visor. I couldn't see anything, too dark. I should have left the porch light on. Or maybe the person knocking was crouched beneath the visor.

\*bang\*

I could feel the force of the knock at the height of my chest. Without realizing it, I knocked back.

There was a pause, and then it came.

\*bang\*

I hit again.

\*bang\*

\*bang\*

I knocked harder.

\*bang bang bang\*

\*bang bang bang\*

I thought the guy must be mocking me. I yelled ""Hey! Stop that!"".

The knocking stopped. I put my ear against the door. I waited for what felt like a good few minutes. And then

""Hey!""

The voice on the other side was quite high. Sounded clean, but somehow unsure. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

""Hey!"" it sounded a bit deeper, a bit more raspy than before. ""What do you mean hey? I asked who are you!"" I yelled back. ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" I could hear the three words coming from different sides of the door. There wasn't just one guy.

""Get out of here, before I call the police!""

""Stop that!"" said one of the voices.

""Hey! Get out of here!"" said another.

Those guys must have been crazy or something. There was a barrage of sounds coming from the other side of the door, and the knocks resumed, now even more intense. I could barely hear Sheriff Waylon's voice on the other side of the phone while I asked for a house call. My mind was filled with those voices.

Hey! \*bang\* Get out of here! Hey! Stop! Get out of here! Police! \*bang\* Stop that! Hey! \*bang\* Get out of that! Call the police! I call! Stop! \*bang\* Hey! Get here! Out! \*bang\* Call the police! \*bang\* Hey! Hey! Hey!

The voices stopped soon after I finished the call. I ran upstairs and took the gun from the safe. Locked myself in the bedroom, and hid behind the desk, gun ready. At times, I could hear some sounds outside. What must have been footsteps, followed by the occasional ""Hey!"". What really shook me, however, was that they sounded remarkably similar to my voice now. Not the way you hear your voice in your own head, but the way you hear it on a recording somewhere, and you get disappointed because it never sounds the way you think it sounds, the way you want it to sound.   

Hey! Hey! Hey!

\*bang bang bang bang bang\*

The hard knocks woke me up from the trance I slipped myself into. They sounded tougher, more determined than even the ones before.

""Hey! Dean, you in there?""

I opened the bedroom door and crept down the stairs, looking around the house for any intruders.

""Dean! It's Otis Bailey from the Sheriff's Department! Are you in there?""

I could see the red-blue flashes of a police car peering through the curtains. Looked through the visor on the front door to see the figure of Otis standing on the other side.

Those intruders left before Otis got here, at least from what he told me. He took a good look around the house before knocking on my door. He saw some footprints around the house, which he showed me. There were indeed multiple sets of indents in the snow, circling the house back and forth, but the blizzard started picking up, and the wind was starting to cover the prints with snow. However, Otis pointed out that there was at least one set of prints leading away from the house, up the holler towards the old mine. Told him everything that happened. He assured me it must have been some kids, trying to prank me. I asked how can there be kids out in this kind of weather. He just shrugged. He asked again whether I want to go to the motel in town, but I refused. Apparently the blizzard will keep going for another few days.

Anyways, I'm pretty tired now, and could really go for some food. I'll get started on some breakfast.

12:15 PM

I hate this snow. It's been snowing non-stop for the past couple of hours. It's so cold that I can't even ventilate the place properly. I can only open the windows for a couple of minutes at a time before feeling like I'm freezing. It's especially bad after I cook, and I'm trying to get the smell out of the kitchen and living room. Kate asked me to fix the vent hood last year, when we noticed it wasn't pulling it's weight while frying some sausages. Should have done it then. No way I can fix it now.

02:34 PM

I'm starting to get really bored in here. Maybe I should have taken Otis' offer of driving me to the motel. At least I would be closer to everything else. At least I would get to go to a shop to see some people. It's very lonely being by yourself in the heart of the mountains here. Guess I never noticed it. I always came here with Kate, and it was the perfect getaway after months of work and busy schedules. We could come here, just the two of us, as a sort of romantic escape. No people, no responsibilities, just us.

11:17 PM

I spent the last few hours finishing the book I took here with me. Bought it a couple of years ago, when I went to a bookstore in Chicago with Kate. She told me it was her favorite book. I've never been much into horror myself. Read some Lovecraft and King in my sophomore year in high school, my friends were really into slasher movies and the likes. This one was really nice, though, especially the second half. I guess I like cosmic horror more than I thought. I predict that I'll have the image of an old, scrappy-looking wizard trying to fish out a leviathan out of a creek etched into my mind for a long time.

Had quite a lot of wine for dinner, I think I'm going to call it a night.



January 26th

04:15 AM

I just saw Kate in the house.

Of course, I didn't actually see her. It's just that I had the most vivid dream ever. I woke up to get a glass of water from the bathroom, and when I opened the bedroom door I saw her, standing there in the darkness of the corridor, her back towards me. I could see her figure pretty well in the silver moonlight protruding from the window. Her hair was tied in a loose bun, as she usually wore it around the house, and I could see she was wearing the earrings I got her for our first anniversary. She refused to wear any other ones. She said it helped her hear our hearts beating even when we were apart. She always was good with words, had a way of making my heart melt with every compliment.

I could see her hands moving by her side. She was slowly flexing and relaxing her fingers, as if her palms fell asleep. She was testing every finger, going back and forth between them. In that dreamy haze, I called out to her. ""Hey..."" that's all I could think of. I never dreamt of her after what happened. I guess it was a way for my brain to give me a bit of peace, at least while I was sleeping. I could see Kate stiffing her neck, but otherwise didn't move. A few moments later, I heard her respond in my own voice ""Hey!"". Next thing I know, she darted down the corridor into the small storage space next to the bathroom. At the same time, I drunkenly limped back into the bedroom and fell into the bed. At the same time, I woke up, sweating, heart pounding. I just started calming down. Don't think I can fall back asleep though.

08:32 AM

Indeed, couldn't fall asleep again. Still thinking about the dream I had. I guess I didn't want to let the rest of a night's sleep wash away the memory. Despite the almost disturbing setup of the dream, I am happy I can dream of her again. I spent the last few hours thinking of her, of us. Too much to put onto paper. I remember, during one of the first therapy sessions with doctor Rodriguez, she asked me if I could pick one memory of Kate that I loved the most. At that time, I told the doc that I couldn't possibly pick just one memory, that I would take any memory with her, be it good or bad, if that meant I could experience it with her.

Now, I think I finally chose a memory. When we were still quite young, when we had just moved from being friends to a full-on relationship, Kate invited me over to watch a movie at her place. We both laid down on the bed, blankets and stuffed animals all around us. We were stuffed from the homemade burgers we had cooked together. We flipped over the channels, until we landed on an Italian movie. At least as far as I remember, it was Italian. The movie depicted a first date between two people. The intriguing part, though, was that besides the date itself, the movie also showed the dialogues between each person's internal voices, as they were making decisions, thinking about the other person, and so on. The movie was pretty good, and we laughed a lot. I spilled red wine on Kate's bed, and I still hope she forgives me for that, but all-in-all we had a really good time. Even though the movie was a decent comedy, the discussion slipped into a somber analysis of the concept and inner workings of relationships. At that time, Kate was quite a bit more pessimistic than me. Stressful times, being a college student. But I still remember, clear as day, as she looked up at me and said ""It's sad when you think about it. Us, people, being so different from each-other, we are basically incompatible."" After I asked why is that, she said ""Because think about it: people are such evil creatures at their core. If relationships were such a natural thing, then why do you see so much abuse, so many broken marriages, so much suffering all around?"" I think I responded something among the lines of ""Because we are social creatures, and we need one another in the end.""

I kept thinking about that moment every now and then. I think about the certainty of human despise and the uncertainty on the world that reflected in her eyes at that time. And then I think about all the good times we had. I think about every joke that ever made her laugh. About all the places we've been to, and the curiosity and fascination she showed experiencing new cultures together. All the late-night talks about nothing and everything at the same time. All the times we cooked together, dancing to the music in the radio while flipping pans and mixing ingredients. All the times we hanged out with friends, and the knowing looks we gave each-other when we noticed something funny. All the silent moments, with her in my arms, slowly drifting to sleep. And I hope that I helped change her mind. I hope that I made her happy.

11:57 PM

Those damn pranksters came back again. They're knocking on the windows and the door. I think they recorded my voice the other night, they keep yelling in what sounds like my voice. Currently I locked myself in the bedroom, waiting to see if they go away.

11:57 PM

They keep at it. I'm gonna call the police.

11:57 PM

Fucking hell, the phone line must be messed up. Called a few times. The call went through only once, and I could barely distinguish what the dispatch guy was saying.

11:57 PM

This can't be happening!!! This can't be happening!!!

Relax, Dean, it will be fine. You have a gun, the door is locked and the police should be on their way. Any moment now.

11:57 PM

Shit, I think they broke in! I can hear footsteps in the house.

11:57 PM

What the fuck is going on? There is constant knocking on my door. It's too fast, I don't see how anyone could knock on a door that quick. After every burst of knocking, they are calling for me to come outside. It still sounds like my voice. Just what on Earth is happening?

11:57 PM

I can't do it anymore. They must have been going on for hours at this point. I hear rapid footsteps down the corridor, going to the bathroom. Then it comes back, just as fast, followed by bursts of knockings. After each knocking, the voice changes.

It drives me fucking nuts! How can it be?! At some point it sounded like Otis, but I know it can't be him. I would have heard his car come up the driveway, surely. Then it sounds like my mother, and doctor Rodriguez, and my friend Jeremy, and AND AND AND AND.

11:57 PM

I saw one out of the window. It got down on four legs and ran towards the house. It had a mocking imitation of clothing on, morphed to its skeletal body. It looked like a pitiful imitation of us. What the hell are these things? And why did it look like Otis?

11:57 PM

The knocking is getting so hard right now. I can hear them on the roof, trampling. They are trying to get in. They are trying to convince me to come outside. I don't think the cops are coming anymore. They are close to breaking the door down. They have Kate's voice.



January 27th

08:14 AM

Had some cereal this morning, about to head out to fix a leak in the roof, above the porch. It's been driving me crazy these past few nights.

19:03 PM

This day was productive, at least I'm happy about that. Still pretty boring out here. The snow completely covers the road up the holler. But at least the blizzard seems to be over. In a couple of days, I hope they can send the ploughs over here.



January 35th

01:06 AM

No updates, everything is fine at the cabin. Excited to go back into town!

15:89 AM

Must be really nice weather in New York now! I really miss Kate. Can't wait to see her again.

14:11 PM

I remember that time we used to go down to the creek. There was an old coal refinery down there. Remember when we would go down there? We were sitting on the edge of the water, skipping stones. You never were that skilled at it. But you liked seeing the miners work. Would you like to go there again?



January 29th

00:13 PM

Hey! It's Dean McConnell again. Sorry about that.

Everything is fine now. It's a bit warm in the house, a bit concerned for the state of the wood. But at least I got the radio back on. So many new things there. Such educational material. And such interesting voices.



5.

Deputy Harlan Harris leaned back in the creaky desk chair. He looked visibly tired. He read and re-read Dean's notebook since arriving at the Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Thompson was kind enough to provide him with a desk near the far end of the precinct, and Harris' back was hurting from sitting down so long. He got up and lit a cigarette, trying to piece together the information.

Dean sounded like he was in a lot of torment, and his handwriting slowly became more unclear as the pages progressed. He talked about someone harassing him, maybe pranking him, but the later entries point to something far more extreme. Dean thought he wasn't tormented by people by the end of it, he thought he was tormented by creatures. He also mentioned Otis Bailey, Sheriff Thompson's Deputy. He thought one of those creatures looked like Otis. Could it have been Otis? No one saw him since the ordeal, as far as the APB put out was concerned.

Harris thought Dean might have lost his mind halfway during his stay at the cabin, due to the loneliness and emotional turmoil he went through. But still, there must be a way to uncover the truth. He walked away from the desk, his boots hitting the marble floor. As he turned the corner, he saw a fleeting shape sliding into the Sheriff's office. Even though he only saw the person with the corner of his eye, Harris recognized the colors as that of Pineville S.D. A few moments later, as he was walking, he heard Sheriff Thompson's voice booming from his office.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1plfzba/an\_extensive\_guide\_to\_cat\_prep\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1plfzba/an_extensive_guide_to_cat_prep_part_1/)

The first part of the post had Part 1 and 2 was about how you start building yourself up through the initial preparation, and initial mock analysis as you start taking mocks. The following part deals with the preparation post-August. 

**The reason for posting this early is to make sure that this reaches aspirants who are starting now.**

**Part 3: Strategy, Stamina and Errors**  
  
Around the beginning of August, you should be comfortable with a mock, and the syllabus overall. Comfortable is defined as “you know what cat syllabus entails, you know how a mock works, you can find your way around a CAT Mock.   
  
Now comes the hardest part. Building up speed, reducing errors, building stamina and a strategy to approach the mock.   
Let’s get to it.   
  
1. **Now it's time to learn to be flexible.** It's time to now be aware of HOW you attempt a mock. By that, I mean for example your VARC attempt style, whether you attempt one before the other, your DILR set selection and thoughts, and fallacies, and how you approach quants in terms of question choosing, moving on, etc.   
  
2. Before we get ahead, this is the point where you want to drop your ego if you have any for a particular section. Does not matter which topic you are good at, you can get better unless you are ranking top 10 consistently in a mock. Which nobody does.   
  
3. Start waking up by 7 am by now, a month ago before Admit, around early October. That is because if you get slot 1, you can quickly adjust to 6. If slot 3, you can just wake up at 9 am. This one month, you may have to suffer a bit depending on your sleep cycle and potential slot, but push as much as you can to build that habit. 

  
**Late mock strategies:**   
  
**Speed**  
  
The below should be executed once you’ve stagnated at a certain score/accuracy or just overall nothing seems to be working. Be warned that there will be a drop of scores. Once the score increases say by +10 and is stuck again, do the whole cycle again. Also, you can be in different phases of the cycle in different sections. See each section standalone and then keep a bird’s eye view of the exam.  
  
**3.1 VARC:** Your final attempt should have at least 20+ attempts in this section. One RC should be done within 7 minutes and VAs should take 2 mins. My target approach was - the three RCs I liked in 20 minutes, then 12 minutes of VA and then 8 minutes for final RC + cleaning up the mess of questions I marked to be reviewed later. Compare yourself to the above strat, and find the difference. How do you push for the above? By reading faster, and trusting yourself that you are choosing the right answer in the first go. The % increase of speed to reach the above is something you have to customize. You will find that your error rate has increased drastically. Let it go up. Don’t compromise on the speed. After 5-10 mocks, you will find that your brain has caught up with your increased reading speed in terms of comprehension.   
  
**3.2 DILR-** Set Selection can be a bit of a luck thing. Remember how I told you about making buckets? This is the time to use them. Find questions, read through them and use the bucket to determine if it is worth taking the risk. As a rule, I just avoid the first set and start reading from last because a number of aspirants will jump into the first set because of rush, and it is a very simple trap to set. This is where your learning and intuition of all the sets you did would come into effect.   
During mocks, have **A/B testing** where  
A: One coaching mocks where I prepare for a normal CAT, for efficiency and go for the easy sets only and   
B: Another coaching where all I do is stress test and push myself to whatever random set I choose. But, for B, remember that this is not a foolish push, but pushing ourselves to the limits, so give up if it doesn't work. Move to another set. Those B scores, if bad, should be logged in to the “experimental” score sheet.   
  
**3.3 Quants:** My approach was simple, 2.5 min per question, 16 questions in 40 minutes. If I can’t solve it in that time period I give up. Make yourself extremely flexible in quants so that you can jump around rapidly. While that is the ultimate goal, it's okay to start with 3 minutes and then push yourself, but once you commit to 2.5 min, do not go back. If you can’t solve it in that time period, then move to next and see if you can solve 5 instead of 4 somewhere else to recover some time.   
  
**Tricks**  
  
 Close to the end of the initial mock period, is when you should start looking for gouging out options and take intelligent guesses. But those guesses should come from- your understanding of the topic, and that CAT usually tries to have integer solutions sometimes. But this is pretty subjective so you’ll have to build your own strategies.   
  
An example from CAT 2025: There was an allegation question where the total volume was 60, and the final ratio was 15:4. So, total volume would be a 19x answer, the lowest 19x > 60 litres was 76, so I guessed 16. While this guessing works with certain assumptions, if there are TITAs left and you have to guess, make those assumptions and guess instead of haphazard ones. 

**Accuracy:**

1. 75% is the absolute bare minimum if you want. **Push for speed only when you have that accuracy**. Keep yourself flexible enough to drop speed in case of a more difficult paper and vice versa. And this understanding of a mock will come only if you are cognizant of what you are doing during mocks. Mocks are not just for solving at this point of time, but also being aware of WHAT you are doing through that 40 min. If needed, document it.   
And then sit and think   
what you did,   
what you want to do,   
where is the gap, and   
how to address it.   
  
  
2. You will randomly sometimes find accuracy dropping for a period of time. Do not fret during those periods. There will be long periods of random stagnancy which don’t make sense, and the only thing that you can control is to take mocks, analyse and move on. There will be some problems that fix themselves, and all you gotta do is not panic and give yourself time.   
  
**Stamina: Level Two**  
  
1. At this point, you should have taken a fair number of mocks. Your speed is also increasing. Now it is time to build stamina. In September-October, you should be taking 2 mocks at least one day in a week and 2-3 mocks on alternate days. In between these intensity periods, chalk yourself a couple of days of rest to recuperate.   
  
My flow was intense September, then a slow start to October, building it up to an extreme stress of October end where I was taking one mock a day almost for 15 days. Then the beginning of November, then started November with a lull of a week of almost nothing, then started building up towards the end of November that I peaked around the exam.   
  
2. If you feel you are burning out, stop. But, that is only if you have pushed through a week of 5 mocks. If you are burning out after 2 days of mocks, the stamina is low and needs to be pushed. Make that call accordingly.   
  
3. Should you push for stamina and speed together? At times, yes, when you’re mentally in that space to take the hit in terms of scores and not get demoralized. Preferably not in the beginning of September when you’re pushing for stamina the very first time, play a little safe, and once you get in the groove, then you can push for both.   
  
**Fatigue, Mood and Post-Exam Emotional State**  
  
1. Feeling a bit burnt-out or fatigue and tired are different states. Since this is subjective, you’ll have to learn to differentiate, and if you’re feeling tired, stop immediately. No learning happens when you’re tired.   
  
2. Start practicing stabilizing feelings of panic and fear early. A cat paper at the end should be like the flow state you are in as you’re driving a car, based more on intuition and practice and not emotions. Take deep breaths in the mock itself, mentally tell yourself to realign and start afresh when stuck.   
  
3. The target for your post-mock emotional state should be neutral, no matter how the paper went. That goal is helpful during paper because it helps you be unaffected by temporary setbacks which will happen randomly on D-day because every variable cannot be as controlled as we like.   
  
4. If you feel anxious closer to D-day, a simple trick is to take a bucket of cold water, bring it in your room and dip your feet in it and sit for a couple minutes.   
  
**Confidence**  
  
No matter what the mock score, do not let your confidence waver at any cost. But do not stop stress testing yourself out of fear. Your confidence should come from the fact that you have taken all possible variables that your life can have, quantified them and thought about them far more than everyone. Randomize your stress testing.  
  
**Silly Mistakes**  
  
I never found a solution to that myself. I usually make zero silly mistakes when under extreme duress, but make a lot of them during mocks. At the end, I just gave up and focused on bettering my execution and ignoring whatever silly errors were there.   
  
**Thought**  
  
**This is written last but is the most important.**   
Spend time thinking what changes can be made, tweaked and constantly do A/B testing of them through mocks. Document your findings and make decisions. And importantly remember that if you feel a certain strategy is something you can’t handle on D-Day even though it's smarter, abandon it. 

**Know when to stop.**  
If you feel exhausted when you wake up, not getting enough sleep, mocks start going haywire without reason, accuracy has dropped to 50, struggling to push through no matter how much you push, it is time to take a step back. Recuperation is needed for thinking, so don’t compromise on that. **Consider CAT a high-performance game, and yourself, a high-performance athlete and care for yourself accordingly.**  
  
**By this point, you should take 50+ mocks.**   
  
**D-Day Prep:**  
  
1. Get new glasses if your specs are getting scratchy and older. Buy a strip of zinc and a multivitamin supplement. Take one each on the morning of D-Day. But make sure you test those supplements out beforehand at least a month ago as to any potential effects like diarrhoea. (I am not a medical professional, **strongly pointing it out that the above is my opinion**, this is simply based on the fact I have found that a slight micronutrient overload overcomes any tiredness that I have) Would mostly recommend going to a doctor to plan it out. 

2. **Get vaccinated**: Would recommend getting a flu-shot. Make sure it's a Northern Hemisphere shot of the current year. Why? Because I feel the risk isn’t worth it. Sort out early if you have allergy issues. Keep diarrhoea medication, digene, and Coldact (or any other variant)- the latter is an over-the-counter common cold symptom suppressant. Just in case you get a cold in November. Keep Meftal handy if you’re expecting your cycle around that time, and if it makes you sleepy, see a doctor and make early arrangements. If you're expecting Day 1 or 2, then XXXL and inshallah I guess.  
  
2. As soon as the Admit Card hits, make your travel arrangements if in another city. Make it as comfortable as possible. If you’re a regular gym goer, try finding a hotel with at least a couple of pieces of equipment. Travel 2 days ago instead of the day before. Preferably get one with a buffet if slot 3 so that you don't have to worry about breakfast.  
  
3. A lot of centers have places to keep the bag and a lot do not. For your piece of mind, I’d recommend having a room.   
  
4. If slot 1, do not overload carbs before the exam. I do not recommend coffee, but if you need caffeine, make it a month-long habit from beforehand. Coffee is a diuretic, so make a habit of coffee an hour before mocks so that you can simulate exam experience and decide whether you want to consume or not.   
  
5. For slot 3, have breakfast around 8 am and an early lunch of around 12 pm of a chicken salad for meat eaters. That will fill you up as well as not make you sleepy.   
  
6. Going to the centre: I prefer going early and making myself comfortable. For the one hour you wait, remember the only thing: You have strategized, thought and prepared as much as you could. So it does not matter what the paper is going to be because you have already thought about it. Rely on your intuitions for strategy at this point and only focus on solving. If stuck, move on immediately. No second guessing yourself, and definitely not letting your thoughts wander. Your goal is to maximise, maximise, maximise.   
  
**Part 4: Working people**  
  
**I am a working person too, and the above may feel a little too much. How to incorporate prep in time?**  
  
1. Discipline- Till D-Day, I had little life myself. When I took breaks from mocks or study, I focused on chores. Additionally, I removed every **decision fatigue** from my life. Bought 5 copies of the same outfit. Made a meal plan to repeat every week. Refused to eat anything out of the ordinary lest I fall sick. And meal prep- I prepared hard. Cooked twice a week in big batches and flash froze and stored them. Cooked rice for 3 days at a time and shoved the pressure cooker in the fridge. Cooked intensely dense dal and then watered it down later with salt-water.   
Or, you can move to a PG which will save a ton of this effort. Optimise every breathing second with a thought out plan and stick to it till you’re sick of it, and then continue to do so. My simple philosophy is- my body will not lose to my mind. I am obstinate enough to be sick of life but I refuse to give up. (**That does not mean no breaks)**  
  
2. Optimizing in office- Whenever I took a break from work, that was the time for me to reflect and strategize. I used to walk and think where I could eke out a small bit of efficiency more in a 2 hour paper. Got Youtube premium and just listen to revision videos like a podcast. Same during the commute.   
  
3. Personally, I feel the first push for prep should be in the final semester, when the academic stress is at its lowest. But in case you are working already, make a 2 year plan instead of time. This plan is keeping in mind you’re targeting ABC, and adjust according to your flexibility.   
  
4. Do not resign for CAT. CAT does not need an all day prep plan.   
  
At the end, your timeline should be similar to this- 

|**Phase**|**Months**|**Focus**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Base|Nov-Apl|Study material|
|Transition|May–Jul|First mocks|
|Strategy|Jul–Sep|Speed & errors|
|Stress|Aug mid -Oct|High mock density|
|Taper|Nov|Floor protection|



Finally remember, hard work and talent is important, but strategy is too.

The former two pillars need the base of strategy and thought to be impactful.  
Do not comment profiles for calls, I do not know.  
  
 I just took CAT a couple weeks ago and had promised myself that I’ll make a strategy post if I get all the calls I want, that’s it.

The coffee was too hot, and still I drank it like it owed me answers. It scalded my tongue on the first sip. I didn’t care. The windshield reflected nothing but clouds, gray, low, indecisive. Like the sky was trying to make up its mind about whether to fall or just watch.

I leaned back, coffee steaming in one hand, guilt simmering in the other. I’d told her off. Again. Told her the world didn’t need more polished predators with god complexes. And still, here I was.

I tossed the empty cup onto the floorboard. The plastic crunch sounded final. Then I stepped out of the car and into the shadow of the Institute.

The architecture was designed to intimidate, brutalism wrapped in glass. The corridors inside were no better. Long, sterile stretches of white tile that smelled of ozone and aggressive cleaning chemicals. My boots echoed too loudly against the floor. Click. Clack. Cameras swiveled silently on the ceiling, black glass eyes tracking my heat signature. I didn’t look up. I knew they were there, just like I knew the doors locked from the outside.

We called it a school. It felt like a containment unit.

I passed the memorial wall, digital screens scrolling names of “fallen heroes.” I didn’t stop. I knew how many of those names belonged to kids who were pushed too hard, too fast. When I reached the heavy steel door of Classroom 4B, I took a breath, buried the cynicism deep in my gut, and pushed it open.

I arrived ten minutes late. They were already there. Tasha had her boots on the desk. Danny was sketching nervous patterns in a notebook. Livia and Sofia whispered, sharing a private joke. Gabe was balancing a pen, trying to look bored. And Leo was in his chair, looking like a smudge on a camera lens, there, but barely.

I stepped in. The chatter died.

“Alright,” I said, voice rougher than intended. “Field trip.”

“A test?” Gabe asked, perking up.

“A reality check,” I replied. “Bring your gear. You’ll hate it.”

\-----

The training arena was a hollowed-out concrete dome, lit by industrial floodlights that hummed with a headache-inducing frequency. And there she was. Elis. She stood in the center of the room, looking like she had walked out of a high-fashion gala and taken a wrong turn into a slaughterhouse.

She was breathtaking. There was no other word for it. Her uniform was tailored, hugging curves that I knew from a lifetime ago. Her black hair was pinned up in an intricate, flawless style, exposing the elegant line of her neck. She smelled like jasmine and rain, a scent that had haunted my apartment for years after she left.

She didn’t look at me. Not really. Just that professional glaze over her eyes that hid everything we weren’t allowed to say.

“You’re late, Zenos,” she said. Her voice was silk wrapped around steel.

“Traffic,” I lied.

“Liar,” she replied, not missing a beat. She gestured to the four stretchers behind her. The “Silent Volunteers.” The students shifted uncomfortably as the thick, chemical smell of preservation fluid clashed violently with the delicate scent of Elis’s perfume.

“Today isn’t about hitting targets,” I announced, turning to the class. “It’s about composure. These aren’t drones. They’re organic matter. They used to be people. Now, they are tools.” I nodded at Elis.

She didn’t cut herself. She didn’t bleed. She didn’t do anything crude. She simply raised her hands, fingers dancing like she was playing an invisible piano. A low hum filled the air. Violet energy sparked from her fingertips, thin, translucent threads of light that spooled out into the air. They were beautiful. Hypnotic. The threads drifted down, latching onto the corpses. One thread to the neck. One to the spine. One to the heart.

Elis twitched her index finger. The first corpse jerked. It sat up, the motion smooth and unnatural, pulled by the invisible strings. Elis looked bored. Serene. A goddess puppeteering the dead without getting a speck of dust on her gloves.

“They feel nothing,” Elis said, her eyes finally locking onto mine. A challenge. “They are just vessels. Do what you must.”

“Group one. Danny. Bea.”

The drill began. Danny stepped up, blood already pooling in his palms. Bea was chewing a lime gummy, eyes darting nervously. Elis flicked her wrist. The corpse lunged, fast, too fast for a shambler.

“Left flank!” Bea yelled. “Liver is sour!”

Danny reacted. He didn’t just splash the blood; he shaped it. He hardened it into a whip, cracking it against the zombie’s chest. The impact knocked the creature back, but Elis’s violet threads pulled it upright instantly.

“Harder,” Elis commanded coldly.

Danny gritted his teeth, focused, and drove a spear of crystallized blood through the thing’s shoulder. It dropped. Elis severed the threads with a sharp inhale. The violet light faded. The body became just meat again.

“Gabe. Trent.”

Gabe was eager. Trent was a nervous wreck. Elis animated the second corpse. This time, she made it run. Gabe panicked, firing a shockwave that went wide. Trent tried to dodge, tripped over his own sparks, and slid across the floor.

“Focus!” I barked.

Gabe corrected his stance. He waited. One breath. Two. Then he released. Boom. He hit the corpse center-mass. Ribs cracked. The body flew backward, Elis’s energy threads stretching like rubber bands before she let them snap.

“Sofia. Mina.”

The quiet ones. Elis made the third corpse crawl, a spider-like, broken movement that made my skin crawl. Sofia didn’t flinch. She whispered, and spiders poured from her sleeves, weaving a net of silk across the floor. The corpse got tangled. Mina sneezed, and roots burst from the concrete, wrapping the body in a tight embrace. Elis tugged on her energy threads, trying to break the corpse free, but the roots held. She raised an eyebrow, impressed.

“Enough,” I said.

“Tasha. Clint.”

Tasha didn’t wait. She charged. Elis smirked and made the fourth corpse jump, high, superhumanly high. Clint stood still, staring up. “Kinetic lock… disengaged.” The corpse stopped in mid-air. Just froze. Tasha jumped, fist crackling with lightning, and slammed the suspended body into the ground. Dust settled. The students cheered.

I looked at Elis. For a second, the mask slipped. She looked tired. Not physically, she never got tired, but soul-tired. She looked at me, and I saw the woman I used to hold. Then she blinked, and the Association’s perfect soldier was back.

“One left,” she said.

“Nico. Livia. Final round.”

Nico phased in and out of reality. Livia sketched the future. Elis re-connected the threads to the first corpse. It stood up, broken shoulder and all. Nico tried to punch it and phased right through.

“Solidify, kid!” I yelled.

Livia turned the page. “Step left.” Nico stepped left. The zombie’s fist missed his ear by an inch. Nico solidified his leg and kicked the knee joint. Crunch. The corpse went down.

“Good,” I muttered. “Review later.”

Then I looked at the back of the room. At the empty chair that wasn’t empty.

“Leo.”

The name hung in the air like smoke. He looked up, eyes wide. He looked around to see who I was talking to.

“You,” I said. “Center stage.”

The class turned. The silence was heavy.

“Go, Leo!” someone shouted. I think it was Bea.

Leo flinched. He looked like he wanted to fold in on himself. Being seen was painful for him. I could see the panic rising in his throat. Slowly, he stood up. He walked to the center of the arena, his posture screaming apology.

I nodded to Elis. “Last target. Make it walk.”

Elis raised her hand. The violet threads spun out, latching onto the last un-battered corpse. It rose. It was big. Heavy. And it was staring right at Leo.

Leo stood there, trembling. He wasn’t looking at the zombie. He was looking at the floor, at his hands, at anything but the monster. The corpse took a step. Then another. Elis made it reach out. Leo looked up. He saw the dead eyes. He saw the violet strings puppeteering the horror.

He didn’t fight. He didn’t run. He just looked offended by its existence. Terrified that it perceived him.

“Disappear,” he whispered.

It wasn’t a spell. It was a rejection of reality.

Snap.

A sound like a violin string breaking echoed through the dome. Elis gasped, a sharp, shocked intake of air. She stumbled back, clutching her hand as the violet energy threads whipped back, severed. And the zombie? It didn’t fall. It didn’t explode. It was just gone. No dust. No residue. The space where it had been was empty. The air rushed in to fill the vacuum with a soft whoosh.

Elis stared at her empty threads, her composure shattered. She looked at Leo with genuine fear. Leo stood alone in the center of the circle. He blinked, looked at his hands, and then looked at us.

The silence this time wasn’t awkward. It was terrified. And for the first time, nobody looked away.

\-----

# Leo

It saw me. It actually saw me. I don’t know what’s worse, being invisible, or suddenly not.

I looked up and the teacher, Zenos, he saw me. He said my name. He pointed. And then the class, they all turned.

“Go, Leo!”

The cheer hit me like a stone. It wasn’t support. It was exposure. Like peering under a rock to see the bugs scurry. I stood up because I had to. The air felt too thick, clogging my throat. Every step toward the center of the arena felt like walking through glass.

Don’t look at me. Please, stop looking at me.

I reached the center. The lights were too bright. Then the woman, Elis, she raised her hand. I saw the violet threads. To everyone else, they probably looked like magic. To me, they looked like leashes. Glowing, vibrating veins of light connecting her perfect fingers to the thing on the stretcher.

The thing sat up. Its dead eyes locked onto mine. And that was it. The breaking point.

It wasn’t just a corpse. It was an observer. It was perceiving me. It was registering my existence. It was pulling me into its reality, and I didn’t want to be there. The corpse stumbled forward, the violet strings jerking its limbs. It reached out. I could feel its focus on me like a physical weight. Gross. Heavy. Invasive.

It was going to touch me. It was going to verify that I was real.

No.

I wanted it gone. Not dead, it was already dead. I wanted the perception gone. I wanted the space it occupied to be empty so I could breathe again. I forgot about the class. I forgot about Zenos. I forgot I was supposed to be weak.

I looked at the space the monster occupied, and I rejected it.

“Disappear.”

I didn’t shout. It wasn’t a spell. It was just a correction.

SNAP.

The sound was awful, like reality breaking a bone. The violet threads severed instantly, whipping back toward Elis like cut wires. And the corpse? It didn’t explode. It didn’t crumble. The universe just blinked. And when it opened its eyes again, the spot was empty.

No dust. No blood. No smell of rot. Just perfect, terrifying nothingness.

Silence flooded the room. Cold. Stunned. I stood alone in the vacuum I had created. I looked up. Zenos was staring. Elis was staring, clutching her hand where the connection had snapped. The class was staring.

They weren’t cheering anymore. And this time, no one forgot. Not even me.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1765628141.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

This is my first big post and I’m super nervous so I’ll try and make this digestible! Here’s some trigger warnings because I don’t want to blindside you! TW!! : !!!Mentions of SA!!!! This is a super heavy subject so I totally understand if you want to scroll off but I need to get this off my chest since it’s eating me alive!

So for some background! I was born in North Carolina and lived there for a couple of years with my siblings, Brayden (M11), Sandy (F12), and Joey (M9). My Dad (50) and Mom (40) had me! Brayden and Sandy are on my mom’s side and Joey is on my Dad’s. They both had separate marriages and their kids before divorce and having me! (These events I didn’t learn about till this year, I am now 18. At a young age Joey started to display signs of a few mental illnesses that seemed to progressively become worse. BPD and Operational Defiance Disorder to name a few. After diagnosis came out my dad spent thousands of dollars into expensive therapy and care facilities that Joey never utilized. It was obvious that Joey hated my mom and hated the separation, and learned very quickly that lying was his greatest weapon against her. My mom worked in the hospital at the time, and he used it. He spun a lie to his therapist that she would attack him, these allegations had to be taken seriously, which meant my mother had her license revoked while the investigation went on. At this time my father was sending his ex-wife half of his paycheck, which was not a part of child support as that was never in any agreement they made. He constantly bounced between states, leaving my mother with four mouths to feed and barely any income. Eventually the investigation turned up nothing but by the time everything was normal the house had to be sold and we had to move. 

(Congrats on reading this far!)

We moved to California when I was four with the rest of my siblings. My father spent a tremendous amount of money on starting a business, and my mom worked back-to-back graveyard shifts. I was raised by my sister Sandy as my brother Brayden left due to my father’s mental abuse, something I would soon learn of. Joey lived with his mom full-time as we lived in her state now, and they were closer. Years went by until I was 8! Joey was making some routine visits by the house, and as an unsuspecting kid, I didn’t know about what had happened in NC and treated him like a brother. He was now 17 and told me all about the cool video games he liked. I showed him my new room that my mom redid with my sister. He closed my door, and after that night, I trauma-blocked the whole night. 

Joey made visits time to time after, but a lot of what happened really involved my dad. At age 12, I started helping at the business. I started to love helping out and talking with the staff about the new Pokémon I would catch on my DS. Freshman year, I really got into it, basically becoming a staff member, but I started to make some bad choices, and I went on lockdown for a year. In that time, I had gotten the most vivid memory of that night with Joey. I remember every detail. I told my mom because I was scared and confused. She sat me down and explained the whole thing about how some things are so stressful for a mind to understand that they get locked away until the mind feels equipped to deal with the overwhelming stress. My mom knew my father and told me to tell him about it with her in a controlled environment to stop him from losing it. 

(Also Brayden(27) Sandy(28) at this time!) 

I told him about the memory, the agony of it all, and he was silent. His face was deadpan and scared. I started to cry, and so did my mom, but my mom was furious. He had destroyed so much of her life that she wouldn’t let him hurt anyone else. I told him to cut him off completely. I was scared of him, but he yelled at me, saying not to give him a timeline on when he should do things. It was only when my mom agreed and said what I said that my father agreed to cut contact. But the weeks after, he grew distant and cold. My father has always been cold and rude to me, always making cruel jokes to others about me, really tearing me down. Always saying how terrible I was at helping him. Saying I didn’t deserve a single dollar I made from working, even though I would work full shifts, even doubles, and never make hourly, just tips. I told him that I felt alone, that he never tried to comfort me or help since the first night. His response was plain, “So you think I’m a bad dad?” I was so heartbroken and angry, but I didn’t want him to be mad at me, so I conceded. He told me the following night that he blocked him, that I was safe. A month passes, and I’m sitting in his car on the way to work, and his phone is connected to the Bluetooth console displaying music. A message comes up clear as day from Joey. I felt my stomach drop. I thought he was blocked. My father said that he keeps reaching out, but my father never responds or looks at the messages. That put me at ease, but something felt wrong. I felt there was more that he wasn’t telling me or my mom. I will admit that snooping is wrong, but I was so shattered that I needed to know what else was going on. I tapped on the message and found countless messages between my father and Joey, them talking about their lunches they had been going on, the movies that had gone to see with each other. All while lying to me and telling me he cut contact. (Note that I hadn’t seen a movie with my father in years. He always opted out.) I took photos and sent them to my mom because I had no idea what else to do. We confronted him a day later with receipts; all he had to say for himself was to scream at me for invading his privacy. I felt so small. I was changed forever, and he didn’t even see that; all he saw was himself and Joey. I realized I didn’t have much place in his life anymore. My mom gave him an ultimatum, which resulted in him truly blocking Joey for the foreseeable future. Life seemed to just progress after that; my scars never healed, but time did its best on the wounds. 

My 18th rolled around and was amazing! All my friends showed up; it was fantastic. It was thrown at work, and all my coworkers were there; it was the best birthday I’ve ever had! But coming home was something pretty scary. My father stayed behind cleaning up while my mom, my friend, and I all packed up and headed home. We have a good group of dogs, which only increased as my brother Brayden came to live with us again, bringing two big dogs into the house. One of our smaller old dogs was convulsing and seemed to be having seizures. This was horrifying to see as this dog has been with my family for years, and to see him like that was horrible. I couldn’t drive yet, and neither could my friend. My mom called my father over and over again, tears in her eyes, holding our dog as he twitched. My friend and I stepped outside to shed some tears and wait for her mom. 
I went back inside, and my mom had finally gotten ahold of my father and was on his way. I took myself off to my room to change. I heard my father’s car pull up the driveway. I walked down the hall to greet him when he started screaming at my mom. The image alone hurts me to remember. My mom’s a tough cookie, but in that moment, holding our dog, she looked so broken. My father bellowed at her, and with tears, she said to please calm down as this was already so much. He screamed to never say that again and to get in the car, before turning  to me, who had been silent, and yelled at me to do a chore I hadn’t done. It wasn’t until hours later they returned. He had chipped his tooth, and a small nerve ending was exposed, causing him pain. Everything was fixed up, but something was truly falling apart elsewhere. My sister, Sandy, returned home as well, right before everything took a turn . Nearly two weeks after my birthday, my mom went alone into my father’s home office and closed the door. I tried to eavesdrop but didn’t hear much. She came out over an hour later and mixed her spaghetti sauce. 
“What was that?” I asked, 
“spaghetti bolognese,”
 “No, the talk with Dad?” 
“Oh! I told him I’m divorcing him”
I swear the world spun. A feeling of shock and relief washed over me. The details are long-winded, but the process was extremely difficult. I had endured so much emotional abuse and neglect I couldn’t bear to take it anymore. I never said a word to him. He had given me silence. I will gladly give it back. He wanted a family dinner, to “talk about things.” I reluctantly agreed, but my mom assured me that I have full reign to say what I need to say. It was horrifically awkward in the beginning. He was smiling and asking about how school was going. He never took interest in me before, only to use it against me later. I was flat in the beginning stages. We were waiting for my sister and brother to get home to truly start the full talk, so dinner dragged on. When they sat down and had a few bites, the talk really began.

It started with my mom, talking about her feeling of forced silence. She felt trapped with no way out, a cage he made for her. Then it was my turn. I stated the facts. I felt disregarded, hated, and seen as secondary. I explained that his awful quips and judgmental comments pushed me down emotionally. With my mom, he listened and apologized. But as I explained how I felt, he began to cut me off, over and over and over again. Correcting how he would never do that. I would explain that making constant jokes about my weight made me self-conscious and really hurt my feelings. He smiled and said he never did that, and I twisted his words around to make him out to be a villain. I explained how I felt unloved and that he never cared for me. To that one, he laughed. That sent my sister over the edge. She yelled, explained that I have valid feelings and that I deserve to say what I need to say, and to never do that again. I’ve never felt more seen in a conversation as she made me feel. I moved on to explaining how him using my insecurities against me was horrible and it made me feel terrible. I explained my fear of my coworkers only talking to me because I was his son and that I wanted them to like me for who I am. He said in the moment that he knows they don’t feel that way. But one night behind the counter, I was talking to one of them, and he said loudly, “Get out from behind the counter. Nobody really wants to talk to you. They only talk to you because you’re my son, right -coworker-?” I was heartbroken by this. My lack of laughter and everyone being uncomfortable spurred a huge fight where he would scream and act dangerous. My brother and sister went after explaining their shared hurt, my brother’s emotional abuse, and my sister’s emotional neglect. Both being deeply wounded by their experiences. When all was said and done, he gave a halfhearted apology and left till midnight. 

A few nights later, there was silence from me as I no longer had anything to say to him. He caught me late at night in the living room, holding over the fact that he owns my phone and its service, and he’s getting it turned off in the morning(i.e in a couple of hours). Since my sister, my mom, and he share this line, I asked if he had told them about it, which he said no, but in a way that confused why he would need to tell them. I explained that if he’s turning all the services off, they should know too, and he replied with “I’m only turning yours off.” I was confused and angry as being targeted is completely unfair and petty as a now 60-year-old man. He goes into the fact that I haven’t talked to him at all, and I explain that I’m not interested in talking to him anymore as I have said my piece. Throughout the whole conversation, he keeps saying, “stop yelling” and “why are you raising your voice.” The entire conversation, I have been at normal speaking tones and keep getting more flustered as he cuts me off saying that. My mom wakes up and asks what’s going on. I explain the whole situation, and her face contorts before backing me, saying how that’s petty and childish. This goes on for hours, as I explain and re-explain why I feel the way I do about the things he brings up. My sister and brother walk out as well and sit next to me. My father starts to shrivel, saying he’s being ganged up on, and I explain that, “no, you just can’t lie and push buttons without a second party also shutting you down on it.” The argument started at 4 a.m. and lasted till 8 a.m. I skipped school and went to sleep. These fights began to be a regular occurrence. All coming to a head a few weeks after I stopped helping at work. I came in to grab a coffee, and my coworkers were looking at me weird, and I asked what’s up, and they said that my father told them that if I come in, not let me near the register because he thinks I’m stealing. I was in shock. I never made hourly so I barely was getting enough money at all for the amount of labor I was doing. I would pull single shifts alone while opening and closing only getting tips. The accusation was absurd, i knew damn well that stealing was wrong and that it would only cause me problems. I explained that I have never and will never steal and that it’s a completely baseless accusation. My coworkers agreed that it felt weird the way my father told them and that they knew me. I told my mom and we came to the conclusion it was turning into a smear campaign against my character. So I refused to go back from that day loving toward. I talked to a few other coworkers and they expressed the sorrow that I wouldn’t return but understood why. A little while later I found out one of my coworkers was having her last day soon and i said I would come in and wish her a fair-well! But leading up I heard that Joey had begun frequenting my work. The place that I spent years of my life at, infiltrating by my abuser. It crushed me. In addition finding out that he was on payroll when I would work doubles all summer every day and never made payroll was salt to the wound. I always knew he loved him more. It was just so horrible having to face it. Him being loved more when my father knew what he’d done. I went in to wish my coworker a happy last day. But my skin was crawling. What if he was here? Was he? Would would I do if I saw him? I thought I was gonna throw up. I wrapped up our goodbyes and went home, running as fast as I could to my car. As I pulled into my driveway notifications flooded my phone. Both the on shift coworkers messaged me about what happened when I left. She explained that my father pulled her aside and said that she shouldn’t talk to me anymore, that I was a wicked person. I wanted to cry, why would my own father do this? I loved him and this is what he does to me? I did some digging through messages and found a thread where Joey said I lied about everything, and was trying to make him out to be a monsters. He brought up points that if you really paid attention never lined up correctly. But my father believed every word. I felt ruined, how could I convince my own father to see what happened to me? And to stop trying to alienate me from the people I love at work?(I am still in constant with them! They are so kind and really helped the healing process!) 

My graduation was looming near, I would have cut him off completely if it weren’t for my car. His name is primary on the insurance, meaning if I wanted to legally drive my car, I would need to have him sign it over to me. So in an act of good faith I was told to invite him. Although I really didn’t want him there, I needed to make sure he would sign the car over to me, no more strings would be attached and I would be completely free. I give him the ticket and he takes it like he expected he had to be there. I let it go and the day of my grad I have my family and my partner, they hadn’t met and I didn’t see a reason they should meet now since the insurance day is the the day after graduation. I get suited up and do the walk out to the field and wave to my loved ones, and graduation goes on. Behind the scenes I find out that my family and partner sit up in the bleachers and Brayden asked my father if he wants to sit with them which he declines and stands off the the side the whole time. After I get out into the ocean of happy parents I take a scan for my father and find that he’s gone, seeming to have left just before I got out. I go have my dinner and the next day rolls around and we get to the AAA to sign over the insurance. He doesn’t say anything to me or my mom, making a thick fog of tension over the whole thing. We are called up and she explains the process to me and my mom while my father looks bored and acts annoyed. The fee came up and my mom had agreed beforehand that she will pay with a check and that it’s no bother. But before she can write anything he throws down two twenty dollar bills onto the table at the lady. And as she’s explaining some of the benefits of having a member card, in the middle of her sentence my father gets up and storms off. No words exchanged. We finish up and he meets us at the door asking if there’s anything else. We say no and he walks out the door before saying good luck to me and walking away. Me and my mom go on side adventure before going home to avoid conflict. When we get there my father has a completely different tone, asking to see my diploma and to go grab it to see it. I agree and go lay on my bed hoping the conversation goes away and I don’t have to engage. My mom filled me in that my father asked my mom why I don’t come visit work anymore. She agreed that it was me who should tell him. I come out with my diploma and she gives asks far too many questions about it before getting to the big question. I explain that he’s being saying extremely untrue and nasty comments about me to staff to alienate me from the place I care most about. He flies into excuses, saying the stage lied about what he said and twisted his words and none of it’s true. I explained that these were all first hand accounts of what happened and that I was extremely upset by the accusations. He doubled down and attacks my character, bringing up things that have no relevance only to hurt me. The second my mom heard what he said she started to raise her voice, absolutely ripping him apart for saying that and picking apart everything that he has done to our family. She was and will always be my hero. 

He’s moved out and I have cut contact. He has chosen the family and he wants and I have nothing to do with it. I’m happy with who I’ve got! 

So sorry this was so long if you read all this you have a fantastic attention span!
I wrote all of this in a night and it was really late I am always open to answer questions or revise anything!! Thank you again for listening to my harrowing tales of 2025 (yes most of this happened this year oh my god)",1,1765627967.0,DysfunctionalFamily,0,1.0,False
