1i86vfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i86vfm/cold_brew_coffee_not_as_strong_anymore/,Cold Brew Coffee not as strong anymore,"So, my wife and I have been making cold brew coffee for many years (we enjoy cold coffee most of the time since we live in a very hot climate) and have recently noticed the coffee just isn't as strong anymore. We have been doing the exact same thing with the same 3 types of coffee for years and over the passed few months, the coffee just isn't nearly as strong despite even letting it brew for longer.

We use to only have to brew our coffee for roughly 12 hours, and it would have a beautiful dark coffee color and it was be very strong, but lately, we've been having to let it steep for 24-48 hours and its STILL a pale color and doesn't have nearly as much flavor.  
Our method is to put an insert full of coffee into a pitcher (made for cold brewing coffee), wet the grounds, and then fill the pitcher until full of room temperature water (and making sure the coffee is fully submerged and wetted properly).

When we brew the coffee using hot water (a pour over method), we get a wonderful color and taste with no issues from the exact same grounds we have been using to make cold brew for years. We've tried a couple other coffee brands and have noticed the same issue.

Has anyone else noticed this lately? Or are we doing something wrong?

I was super anxious and it took him by surprise but he didn’t say no and I gave him my number so he could think about it. 

The update: the day after (yesterday) he texted me saying he really liked it that I asked him (but he was pretty overwhelmed too) and had thought about it but that he isn’t ready yet to date again (I guess he maybe just got out of a relationship, and if so I respect this). I appreciated his honestly and I told him this + if he ever changes his mind he knows where to find me (even if it would be just as friends). I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t just a tiny bit sad because I am, but I really do appreciatie his honesty, and this makes me like him even more if that makes sense (or is that weird?). He’s not the type to hold me onto a string just to please me when he isn’t really into it at the moment.
But I’m also pretty proud of myself for finally having the courage to ask someone out, because I’ve never ever done that before, nor has anyone ever asked my out.  So even though it wasn’t a yes or a no (because I feel like there’s maybe a possibility with time passing), I’m glad I did it, it feels like a relieve. It’s now out of my hands and up to him when he is ready. I’ve planted a seed and now I need to wait and see wether it will grow or not ",1,1737648516.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

The steam pressure has been my biggest, possibly only, complaint about the GCP, but I feel like this just fixed it.

This is old news for some of you, but for those of you that are still struggling to achieve better steam pressure on the GCP, try using a one hold steam tip. You might need to make a very slight adjustment to your steaming technique, but nothing to sweat over.

This is just the one that I purchased on Amazon. $15 after tax and I got it after one day. I know there are several other brands out there selling these so I’m sure any of them will do.

Also, for those that are waiting for the steam light to turn on, try to start steaming 5-10 seconds earlier to improve steam pressure. That was the first thing I did to improve my steaming experience on the GCP and this new steam tip is the cherry on top!",2,1737648395.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’ve noticed recently though that she is verrrrrry happy to stay in her crate in the morning, she’ll drag waking up out as long as possible. Our routine has become me coming back from the gym at 7am, watching her on her cam while making breakfast, coffee, taking a shower, and the whole time she’s just totally asleep and content. When I open the crate door she doesn’t make any sudden moves to come out, she takes her relaxed time.

I certainly think she’s very comfortable in there, and I think she’s gotten less excitable at 2, but I also want to make sure this isn’t totally uncommon behavior for poodles, because she could stand to lose 2-3 pounds and we’ve struggled to manage it between all training treats (which we’re slowing down) and the fact that we don’t have a yard or go to dog parks. I don’t want to dismiss the possibility that not being totally lean = a bit less energy but if she’s happy and comfortable then who am I to change things up.

For reference we go on a 45-60 min walk in the morning, 30 min in the afternoon, 45-60 min at night, and a couple 10+ min fetch sessions. She does a play group at her school with likeminded (see also: willing to pay) pup parents once a week. I did my very best to add value to things I’d like to do, like sit in front of a coffee shop. Now, she drops anchor in front of places like Starbucks or her favorite restaurants knowing that will mean treats and sometimes it’s stopping our walks short and I’m debating whether to drag her along or just sit and make it clear it’s not always treats.

Again, I know all dogs are different and have different personalities but everyone I describe our routine to seems shocked she is so content to sleep in, just curious if there are other poodles out there like this!",2,1737648225.0,poodles,1,1.0,False

1i86mnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1i86mnl/someones_been_locking_me_out_of_my_house/,Someone’s been locking me out of my house.,"I recently moved into a humble little trailer that has chains on the exterior doors for in-the-house security. Y’know, the ones with the track just let the door open just a little? My back door just has a chain and a deadbolt; there’s not even a door knob. I just pull the door to, and twist the deadbolt to keep the door closed. I also chain it for extra security. But for a few weeks now I keep coming home to the chain on my front door being locked. 

I work as a delivery driver for an Arkansas based medical marijuana cultivator, so I’m away from the house hours on end for deliveries across the state. The neighborhood I live in is quaint, like in those 80’s movies. There’s kids that play basketball and ride bikes in the street, but that’s the loudest it gets out here. So when it seemed that someone was breaking into my house to lock me out of it, I was baffled at who it could be and how they could be doing it. Every time it’s happened there was no evidence other than the locked chain. No broken windows, no open doors, not even as much as a secret tunnel bored out of the floor (I’ve checked.) 

It’s happened every delivery day for weeks now. The first time, I called my landlord and he cut the chain with bolt cutters before promptly replacing it, along with the door knob. He didn’t bother with the back door, it was supposed to be locked at all times so I didn’t notice it at first. My landlord is a stand up guy, so he put up a “NO TRESSPASSING” sign in my window and a “Beware of Dog” sign in my back yard to help deter the criminal pranksters. 

The second time it happened, I was convinced I was going into heat stroke. The hot Arkansas sun had slow roasted me for 12 hours in a van with a busted AC. When I got home I was exhausted and irritable. So, to see my door was locked again? I lost all sense of direction. I looked to my neighbors, chatting in lawn chairs across the street. They weren’t paying no mind but I convinced myself they knew something. 

“Hey, what do y’all know about this?” I hollered from my porch. I knew speaking vaguely would catch them in their lies but they answered back after a puzzled silence.
“Know about what?” I didn’t like that question. I eckspecialy didn’t like that they answered my question with a question. I bit my bottom lip in anger and acted drastically; charging my door with all 300 pounds of my stocky figure. The door frame splintered as my door swung open, the cool AC bringing my boiling blood to a simmer. I instinctively shut the door and leaned against it, harboring my bitterness toward my neighbors. 

After cooling down for 15 minutes or so, I regretted how I acted toward my neighbors. I opened the door, the wooden chunk of door frame clattered against the metal door like an encore to my drama. I stepped outside seeking to confess, but my neighbors had gathered their kids and seemingly left. All the usual cars were gone and the lack of interaction left me wrestling my own regret. I didn’t even believe it was them, hell, their kids would rather leave a basketball in my yard overnight than come get it without asking first. 

I went back in my house and moved the chain lock up the door with my drill, too embarrassed to call my landlord again. While fixing my mistake I reasoned that whoever is doing it only knows my front door routines. I decided that I’d be leaving my front door chained up on Thursdays and opt to use the back door and just lock it with my key. It wasn’t fool proof logic, as there was no way to lock the chain on it, but it let me sleep that night. 

The third time, I had left my front door chained and used the back door to leave for work that morning, as planned. I made it to work on time. After coming back I opened the front door, but it was chained. My heart dropped before remembering that I had done that myself. I chuckled and walked around the singlewide trailer to the back door. I slid my key into the slot and turned. The door creaked open until it didn’t. The chain had been locked, leaving the outward swinging door open only inches. I shot a glance inside and saw my empty house exactly how I had left it. It’s a sight that I welcome on any occasion, but the partial view into my living room and kitchen churned my stomach like a rollercoaster.

I bit my cheeks and shut the door, locking the deadbolt. I got off my porch and paced in my over grown yard. My mind was just as cooked as the second time, but it obviously wasn’t the weather. It was a breezy 75 degrees. The only thing I could think of that wasn’t some supernatural fairytale was the stray cats that had been using my crawlspace for shelter. It sounds crazy I know, but it’s just about as crazy as what’s happening to my doors so I blamed them. I found the slot that they enter and exit from and pulled the siding back. Dropping to my knees, I crawled in the damp enclosed space with the intention of finding any of these cats. 

I scooted my bulbous form into the crawlspace. I grunted while I wrestled my phone out of my pocket for light. I shone it into the thick darkness and two eyes glinted back from about 10 feet away. I analyzed the floor above me and became furious. It was posted up right under my front door. The cats eyes glowed and reflected pale blue-green and orange from the light of my phones flashlight. It was the gray and white cat I had seen and “pspsps’d” at many times before. It was standing tall, arched back, and hissing with teeth exposed. I moved for the cat but my shorts caught on the siding and I fell flat on the mud, giving the cat its opportunity to bounce, which it did.

As the cat skirted past me, I reached for it in rage. My grasp was in vain, but I was convinced my soiled clothes would not be. I started crawling toward the floor under my front door to check for holes or trapdoors. I shouted expletives as I found nothing. And my confusion enslaved me to my crawlspace for 45 minutes. I spent the better part of that hour scouring the underbelly of my trailer for possible points of entry. I never found one. When my phone died I gave up on the hunt. I left the 650sqft dungeon to another beautiful Arkansas sunset. 

The painted sky watered my eyes and the natural breeze cooled my now brown and wet clothes. As I collected what was left of my rational thoughts, I traipsed over to my front door. The chain still being locked licked me in the pride just once more. I broke the door frame again and “fixed” it again. My house mocked me just for being in it at this point, I used its facilities to clean myself and then left for my brothers house under the guise of being broke and hungry for a meal. He fed me and offered me his guest bed but I was not going to be kept out of my home. 

I went back and started planning to the best of my ability. 

I researched home security systems and defense tips all that night. Given what I could afford, I decided to replace the doors, install some motion triggered cameras, and fix the underpinning. After my sleepless night of planning, I made it to work on time the next day. 

They skipped a week. I always have deliveries on Thursdays but the Thursday after the third time, I had no delivery. My chains hung limp from the door frames just as I had left them. They were playing with me, but I had more power than them, I was in charge of my house and they weren’t changing that- they AREN’T changing that. I used the leeway to complete my plans and add some extra defenses. Along with the underpinning getting fixed, I put bowls of antifreeze, rat poison, and Jerry-rigged punji boards under the floors below my doors to keep them out. Whoever “they” are should get a nasty infection from the nasty old nails I used.

My next-door neighbor “mowed my lawn” today. It’s two days until delivery, and my neighbor used his zero turn to mow my back yard while I was at work. If he was in my yard while I wasn’t here, what else is he willing to do when I’m not there. He told me while he was still sitting on his mower, dressed in his work clothes. He’s an at-home mechanic, so it’s a plain t-shirt and some jeans that might be older than me. After he said it, my mind seemed to be wiped. I looked at him, noticeably angry, and demanded “What else did you do?” 
“What?” He said with an uncomfortable chuckle. His response hit a reflex that I’d never had before. I took a clumsy but powerful swing at him and clipped his left cheek with my fist. He jumped off his mower and stepped behind me as I staggered from the spontaneous punch. As I turned around his fist met my right cheek dead-on. I ate the blow and stepped toward him, seeing double. I took a swing at the one on the left but the right one dodged, placing a hand on my back that guided me flat on the ground. 
“Man, this the last time I do something nice for you.” He said with more disappointment than anger. I accepted my position and didn’t move or acknowledge him. To this he shot a loogie right on the back of my head and mounted his lawn mower once more, riding away angry. I remained laying for several more minutes before going into my unlocked house. 

It’s Thursday again, I’m writing this from the passenger seat of the van. I made it to work on time even though I didn’t sleep very well. The swelling on my cheek has gone down, but it still stings pretty bad. I’ve been checking my cameras on my phone all day but nothing yet. Long road ahead but I’ve got a good feeling about it this time. 

I got back. Chains were locked. I broke the door and took the chains off. I buried them in my back yard and I went to bed. It should have been my first move, but it’s over now; no chains means no locked chains. 

I woke up for work earlier than usual and made a cup of coffee. As I went to take a shit I saw my back door wide open and got concerned. I pulled it to and closed the deadbolt before glancing at where the chain used to be. Four holes on the door and the frame, no lock. I exhaled in relief, relieved myself and took a pleasant shower. I got dressed and walked out the door, only I didn’t. The chains rattled as they were installed on the top and bottom of my front door. Caked in dirt and identical to the ones I buried; I ran to my back yard where I buried them and saw the hole exactly how I left it. Nothing was dug up, nothing was out of place. 

I went inside and grabbed some clothes, my tooth brush, and my cup of still warm coffee. I put on my rubber oven mitt and grabbed a fork. I stuck it in the socket closest to my front door and it snapped and popped as I left the house to burn. I made it to work on time. ",0,1737648031.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

I was depressed, had zero motivation, and the only reason I was ever actually going into work was half because my body was running on auto-pilot, and half because I liked the routine. It gave me something to work with, therefore my brain had enough to be distracted from the torment that built in my mind.

One day, I got a call from a customer who wanted a credit on a late fee. When I would get these calls, I would usually give them a credit regardless of the amount. Times are hard, yk? Why am I gonna make somebody struggle when I can easily help them over $5?

This time, though, holy *shit*.

I'm sitting at my cubicle, waiting for a call on a slow day, when this piece of work calls.

**Me:** Thank you for calling \[insert place I work\], this is doesnotexist9, may I have--

**Dude:** About DAMNED time, I was on hold for almost two hours! (this was a lie, everyone in this shift had a 10-ish minute break between calls. It was *slow*.)

**Me, obviously wanting to be nice:** Oh, I'm so sorry about that! Let me take your name, and your pin so I can help assist you faster.

**Dude:** \[scoffs\] Isn't my information already on the screen? Why do I need to repeat it?

**Me:** This is purely for verification purposes, sir. I need to verify you so I can access the account.

**Dude:** I already went through that with the automated voice! Why do I need to do it again!

**Me:** Sir. I don't know your name. I need to verify you.

This goes on for fifteen minutes, I shit you not. I don't even know how I managed to keep my cool at the time, as I seem to have anger issues now! Eventually, he gives me his information and I see the balance he owes at the top of the screen. $3000. I think, maybe he called to make the payment. So the call proceeds as such.

**Me:** Okay sir, now that we have your account verified, how can I help you?

**Dude:** Yeah, I need a credit made to the account.

**Me:** ...for how much?

**Dude:** $3000.

I put myself on mute at this point, for a few seconds only. I start bracing myself to get yelled at because I'm about to tell him that even if I was able to give him the credit, I could only give him a credit for $1499.99. I unmute myself, and tell him that I'd be happy to look into his issue and that I would need to look at his previous bills for further investigation. He doesn't sound too pleased with that, but doesn't say much after that.

I'm scrolling through this dude's past bills, and I come to the conclusion that the balance on the account is purely in late fees. $3000 in fucking ***LATE FEES***. I don't remember from when they started or when the call happened, but I do remember thinking, just how the fuck do you let this happen?? And how does this dude have service up still??

Taking a deep breath, I go back and talk to him.

**Me:** Okay sir, I looked into things on my end, and I unfortunately can't give you that credit.

**Dude:** What? Why the fuck not?

**Me:** Because the balance on your account is all due to late fees. Plus, even if I wanted to, this is beyond the amount we're allowed to give.

Then he just starts screaming at me, going on a rant about how I'm incompetent, how I suck at my job, and how I can't do the one thing he called for me to do. I'm ignoring him, sipping at my Irish coffee (this job sucked, I needed it :) ) when he drops this absolute banger of a line.

**Dude:** I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna shoot you straight in the fucking head.

Keep in mind, he had no idea where he called to. I, on the other hand, had his home address right in front of me. He lived states away, so I had nothing to worry about. I had half a mind to read it out to him so he knew he had no power over me. On the other hand, this was probably the lowest point in my life. I had nothing to live for at that moment. I possibly have gone farther than rock bottom, and I felt nothing anymore.

So without missing a beat, I talk.

**Me:** Sir, you'd actually be doing me a favor. Now are you gonna pay in credit or in debit?

It's silent for a full minute. I'm simply waiting for a response. I start to think maybe he hung up, when he finally speaks.

**Dude:** Credit. Let me get my card.

So I take his number, he makes the payment, and I end the call with a cheery ""And thank you so much for calling \[place of work\] I hope you have a wonderful rest of your night!"" when he hangs up.

My supervisor pulls me into an office the next day and asks if I'm alright. I'm confused for a sec before I remember that people actually listen to our calls. He was notified by the person doing my audit, and I was almost sent to a therapist. I ended up declining, as I didn't have the right insurance for a good one at the time.

I don't regret telling him that. I hope he learned his lesson about talking to call center representatives :)",1,1737647918.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False

So I was talking to a guy on hinge with who I had a great conversation. He asked me out but I couldn’t at the time but we still kept chatting and said that we’d love too when we’re both back because he was leaving too. Turns out by a huge coincidence he works at a radio station that I work in one day a week. I hadn’t  really heard from him during the break but I texted him when I was back and he said he was too.
I texted him again later saying I’d be working at the radio so that he wouldn’t be blindsided. He was like okay great so not much reaction by text. He then left me on read for the rest of our conversation. When I saw him for the first time it was a very close work setting and we were next to each other the entire time. We were both nervous I can tell and he seems shy but we still managed to talk. He finished later as he actually is an employee but I gained the confidence to ask him if he might want to get a coffee once he has finished and he seemed very happy too. He said he’d let me know when he was done. He never did so I went home. The next day I put a question about book recommendations in my story and he answered so I texted him asking about it. I said sorry if I made him uncomfortable and he said that he needed to apologize to me instead for not texting me but that we could do something on a weekend. I saw him at work today and everything was normal and chatty. At lunch we both went to a supermarket talked the whole way back and forth. Right as we were going back into the office I said that if he had changed his mind it was 100% okay if he wanted to forget about before but that I needed to know. He said he was very busy ( which is true) and that he goes home on some weekends ( not in the same city) but that he would be down to get a drink on a weekend. I said I didn’t want to force him and he said he wouldn’t be. Everything was like before and I’ve left home now.

But we are a household that has never had dogs and wanted to know if there are items we should hide until we understand our new dog's temperament. I.E. items on coffee tables/breakable items or expensive shoes. I have statues and other decorations around the home and was wondering if it was better to have them out when she gets here. I am not a minimalist and love my decor but don't want non replaceable things damaged. My sister's dog just ignores all her decor (german shepard/Belgian Malinois mix) but I know not all dogs are that way. Any advice on the topic would be appreciated!

I also know I have non pet safe plants (zz plant) but the zz plant is on a higher table and had yet to shed it's leaves but I will keep a closer eye on it but if I should move it to a place where she will never be, let me know!",1,1737647393.0,puppy101,6,1.0,False

\*\*\*Trigger warning - This post contains stories of animal cruelty \*\*\*

Hello, and welcome to a walk through the tire fire that is my past. I start this memory by saying that my resume is simply a list of all the crap I will never do again.

Today’s story will be from a time in my life when I was a veterinary assistant at an overnight emergency animal hospital. Slightly dodgy and poorly lit area of town, circa 1999. These are a few examples of the people I encountered on 1 special holiday weekend. Jesus, take the wheel.

The building was white brick, and very plain. From the street, it had a few black tinted hopper windows, way up high at about the 7-foot mark. No normal person could see in or out of them, they were for lighting only. The employee side of the reception desk was only accessible through a door from the breakroom. Both the breakroom doors and the door back to the trauma bay were keypad entry only. All of this was for the safety of the staff. The place was actually much larger than it looked from the outside.

What made this particular job difficult, outside of the hours, were the people. What are people DOING with their lives?! This job, by the way, is where my soul truly began to die. Where I lost my faith in humanity as a general rule, and why I will ALWAYS love my pets more than people.

These stories take place over the span of a long 4th of July weekend. 4th of July was on a Sunday that year, so the holiday fun started early. A lot of people began to party on Thursday and rode that train all the way to Monday. I worked Friday to Sunday, 4 PM to 8 AM.

Cast: 

OP: Me

Vet Joe

Vet Jane

OM: Office Manager

CH: Crazy Hippie

CK: Crazy Karen

Bob: Drunken tire fire of a human

Friday, 6 PM – I hear the lobby bell and get up from my coffee to tend the front desk. I am greeted by a woman that looked like she was a 60’s hippie that never let go of the summer of love. She had long dirty blond and gray hair lovingly quaffed in the style of an Evil Minion from Despicable Me. She was very lean and had an oversized hemp purse that had seen more road ware than Keith Richards. The smell of Patchouli was strong with this one… In her arms, she had a blanket with what was quite possibly the world’s oldest dog, bundled up like a baby. Before I describe this poor creature, let me start by saying, I love animals, and understand the bonds people have. I also understand that there are a lot of medications that may be required to address the entity that was, this woman.

CH: Yes, I just came from my vet. They will be closed for the holiday, and my Bruce needs to stay here under care until my vet opens on Monday.

This wasn’t uncommon. If a family vet had a critical ICU animal, we would sometimes be called on to watch over them on weekends. Boarding with a bit of extra love, normally. In Bruce’s case, it was going to be a bit more than love. She places the blanket on the counter, and I unwrap him a bit to take a look at what I will be working with, and I pause. It was a black and white rat terrier. All of his black fur was almost gone and replaced with thinning gray fur from age. The dog was an emaciated skeleton and 22 years old. Poor old Bruce couldn’t walk, as his muscles had atrophied long ago, and he was completely deaf and blind, also from age. He had, at one point battled cancer in his lower jaw, which had been partially removed and long since healed, leaving less than half a lower jaw and giving the poor creature a mouth that would never close. His tongue lolled out, licking at nothing most of the time in a twitch that was akin to sleepwalking if you can understand that image. He also wore a newborn diaper. The little guy was hardly alive, and desperately needed death to take him. I was stunned and instantly pained at his struggle to breathe. I had to place him in a pressurized crate that would basically breathe for him for the weekend until her vet was open and could put him back in theirs. She simply REFUSED to let the poor dog die.

Me: \*handing her a clipboard with paperwork\* Can you please fill this out?

I stop at this moment because she had dove back into the wasteland she called a purse looking for HER pen. No other pen would do. I go to set the clipboard on the counter instead while she looks, and I notice that a VERY long and angry bit of frazzled hair is lying dead across the counter in front of me. I absently brush it to the floor before setting the clipboard down on the clean surface. CH snaps. Like, she actually had a full mental stop and screamed as though I had just flushed her goldfish down the toilet in front of her. She DOVE to the floor in a panic, TEARS streaming down her face, as she CALLED FOR THE HAIR! I stood there astonished, not moving an inch as I watch this play out. After about 30 seconds she pops back up, with the prodigal hair gripped tightly between her fingers. She dug a change purse out of her handbag and opened it up, the entire time TALKING TO THE HAIR LIKE IT UNDERSTOOD HER… apologizing for what the bad woman did to it, before kissing it and placing it into the change purse. I caught a glimpse when she opened it, and the purse was STUFFED FULL of old hair. I didn’t ask any questions. I just pretended that didn’t happen and kept going. If you wanted to keep your sanity, that’s what you did here.

CH begins talking… to nobody really, as she filled out the paperwork. I was the only other person in the room, except for my OM, who came out now and then just to see the train wreck, before escaping back to safety to watch the events unfold on CCTV in the breakroom.

CH: Bruce and I were married.

\*she begins, clearly emotional, while I begin thinking about how I am clearly being underpaid…\*

CH: We were in love for 30 years.

She says this, as she looks lovingly at this gasping dog who if it could talk would demand you end this crap this instant. She finally looks up at me and makes the 1st real eye contact she’s made since walking in.

CH: After Bruce died, I thought my life was over. But he came BACK to me!

She said, and then started WAILING. Her sobs were so loud that I think the sonar impact was hurting Bruce, because the poor thing winced, even though he couldn’t see or hear.

CH: He was reincarnated, and I am NOT going to lose him twice!

She stated this defiantly, and covered the tiny creature with kisses, willing him “better”. At this point, poor Bruce had clearly been out of the O2 tank as long as he could stand, and unless I wrenched him away from his “wife” He was going to die right now, and I wasn’t getting paid to clean up the mess that would follow that event. In 1 swift move, I scooped him up, blanket and all, by wrapping my arm under her head and around the blanket and giving it a swift yank. Sort of like a magician with a tablecloth.

Me: Of course. \*I said, wrapping the dying animal up a bit better and nodding to her.\* Then I need to get him back right away. I’ll be right back.

Before she could choke back the snot, I was through the back door and in the trauma bay, handing Bruce over to our 1st call Vet for the weekend, my friend June. She took the dog, lifted the blanket and blinked, astonished.

June: WTF is this?

Me: Our charge. Don’t let him die or his wife will never leave.

\*I said, motioning to the CCTV in the corner of the room, where CH appeared to be smelling her armpit and then her purse. We both paused a moment to appreciate that image, before ushering Bruce into a canine version of an iron lung. Vet Joe had come in by now and was giving Bruce a diaper change and preparing to hand feed him a paste that was the only food he could manage by mouth while June was giving the poor old man a general once-over and writing down his vitals.

Me: \*returning to the front desk\* CH, he’s getting settled in right now. We will take good care of him. Do you have your paperwork ready? \*I ask as I watch over her shoulder, people coming in with an obviously critical dog.

CH: Yes, but I’d like to visit him at least 4 times every day. What are your visiting hours?

Me: \*stern, knowing the weekend we are in for\* I’m sorry but we have no visiting hours. If you call ahead and we are not busy we can bring him to a room for you, but I’d discourage removing him from the tank until Monday. He’s spent far too much time out in the open air, and its parvo season. \*I said this very frankly as I nodded over her shoulder to the people behind who’s dog had just projectile expelled from both ends of his body at once. The smell of parvo filled the room, driving her out to her car in a shriek as I think to myself that this is the 1st time I was glad to see a parvo dog.

We ended up with 7 parvo dogs that weekend. Our entire isolation room was full. The stench would kill a New York sewer rat as 7 dogs went off like intermittent showerheads. This room had to be cleaned constantly, and the smell of parvo lasts for days after the last dog is gone, even after multiple bleachings. It isn’t for the faint of heart. Please, people… Vaccinate your dogs! It's not worth it. TRUST ME.

Early night on Saturday, we are in surgery, working on a standard poodle that had managed to eat an entire bag of dog food and had developed a gastric torsion. This is where the weight of the stomach causes the stomach to physically flip over inside of the body, twisting up the intestines like a garden hose. This is fatal if we can’t flip it back over.

\*phone rings\* I hit the speaker in the surgery suite, as we have nobody else on staff to man the desk right now. – Emergency Vet Clinic, this is OP, how many I help you?

Bob: \*spits loudly and then snorts, sucking snot back into his brain before bellowing in a slightly too loud for conversation, midwestern drawl – all of it echoing around the surgical suite, while Vet Joe tries not to lose his composure.\* Yeah… Do ya’ll do tails?

This vet hates fashion mutilation, and won’t dock, crop, or declaw. They are very vocal about that policy. But in 1999, it wasn’t yet a popular stance. It was still very mainstream and common to have these procedures done.

Me: I’m sorry, no, we don’t. You would need to follow up with your normal vet for tail docking assistance.

Bob curses a bit, calling me a pu\*\*y, and hangs up the phone.

Fast forward to 1 AM, Saturday night/Sunday Morning – Several firework burn victims and hit by cars have come in, and we were packed and quickly running out of room for more trauma cases due to the overwhelming number of parvo cases… and of course, Bruce taking up the oxygen tank. Bruce was hooked up to an alarm that would sound any time his heart stopped. It went off every few hours, prompting emergency resuscitation actions each time. We have now also acquired a full-size Newfoundland with parvo that had to be housed on the bay floor because we simply had nowhere else to put the poor boy and he couldn’t stop wreching. My nerves are about shot, my scrubs will need to be burned, and I haven’t smelled clean air in at least 8 hours. Posted hours mean nothing on a weekend like this. You stop when the work stops… and it never stopped.

Me: \*tangling with Bruce’s heart monitor for the 27th time tonight, grabs the cordless phone going off in my pocket.\* Emergency Vet Clinic, this is OP, how may I help you?

\*silence, with a distant crackling sound\*

Me: Hello?

\*Silence, but there is obviously someone breathing\*

Me: Hello can you hear me?

\*whispering voice\*

CK: I need your help

Me: \*Now paying attention and mildly concerned but in a loud hospital and unable to hear her\* Maam, if you need help, please call 911, or speak up. I can’t understand you,\*

\*click – call ends\*

The Newfoundland, sadly, passes away and I am trying to deal with the body. As I’m struggling to get a dog who weighs more than I do into the cold storage, the phone rings again.

Me: Emergency Vet Clinic, this is OP, how may I help you?

Bob: Ya’ll do tails? \*In the background I can hear the stereotype and I can almost smell the alcohol through the phone.\*

Me: No, Sir, we do not dock tails. Please contact your normal vet on Monday if you would like to have a cosmetic procedure done on your dog.

Bob: Yeah, but they didn’t come off. \*he says, as he again clears his sinuses\*

Me: I’m, sorry, what didn’t come off? \*I ask, afraid of the answer I’m about to get. My office manager has now come into the room to help me and has stopped as I’m obviously frozen in place.\*

Bob: The tails. How long till they drop off?

At this, I can taste my heart in my throat and press Bob for more details.

Me: Well, what sort of dog do you have?

Bob: I have 2 Rottie puppies, and I “did” their tails, but they didn’t fall off.

\*feeling my heart skip 2 beats I feel slightly sick\*

Me: They don’t fall off on their own. They must be surgically removed.

Bob: Right, so I need to know if you do tails.

\*now convinced I need these dogs I ask –

Me: How did you do the tails?

Bob: I put rubber bands on them for a few weeks and took a meat cleaver to them.

Bob’s botched attempt left the 2 pups with tails devoid of sensation and dangling by mangled joints, then left to rot while flies ate away at them. I knew exactly what to expect so without a second thought I went to the front desk and pulled out a new patient form. My OM followed me, now emotionally invested in this gruesome event. I’m glad he wasn’t standing in front of me at the time because I can control my voice, but my face absolutely needed deliverance in that moment.

Me: I’m sure we can help. Let me take down some information to help you with faster check-in on arrival. We are really busy tonight.

As if on cue, Bruce’s heart monitor goes off again. I put my head in my hands a moment and mouth JUST LET HIM DIE to OM, who makes a frowny face and turns to check on Bruce, shaking her head, both knowing we can’t let poor Bruce go against the wishes of CH, but both wishing we could.

Me: May I have your address, please?

Bob gives it to me, and without pausing to think about it I continue –

Me: And what is your trailer number?

OM punches me lightly on the shoulder and mouths, “You can’t say that!” as Bob says #16. Her mouth gapes and I mouth \*Called it\* and proceed to complete the paperwork. Bob pulls up 45 minutes later in a rusty truck without a working muffler, carrying 2 8-week Rottweiler puppies clearly infested with parasites, with their tails mangled in bloody dried masses behind them. We all hated Bob.

Bob: I need you to clean em’ up and make em’ look nice. When are they gonna’ be ready? \*He drawled, clearly drunk. My office manager had already called the police to be waiting when he left.\*

Me: On Monday they will be released to your primary veterinarian and you can make your arrangements with him.

Vet June took the puppies back to trauma, while I took a deposit from Bob for their care. Bob was arrested by the police in the parking lot for driving under the influence, driving on a suspended license, driving without current insurance, and animal cruelty.

4 AM Sunday night/Monday morning – Phone rings

Me: Emergency Vet Clinic, this is OP, how may I help you?

CK\*Quite pause and a tiny voice\* Can you help me?

Recognizing the same voice from before, I sit down in the now quiet break room, Vet June looking up from a game of solitaire to muse at my puzzled face.

Me: What do you need help with?

CK: They are taking pictures of my trees again.

\*long pause\*

Me: What?

CK: They are taking pictures of my trees again… can you see if they are still out there?

Remember, I’m in a building with virtually no windows, and we don’t go outside during the night shift, for safety reasons.

Me: Maam, this is an emergency animal hospital. I don’t know where you live, and I can’t see outside right now.

\*CK was angry with me now, accusing me of “trying to make sure she fails!”

Me: \*Now rubbing my temple, wondering who exactly she thinks I am\* …ummmm, ok?\*

CK: You HAVE to go look. Do you want ME to look? Do you know what happens if they see me?! They always take pictures of my trees. That’s how it starts you know! \*Her voice was ramping up higher, more panicked with every word, until she stopped silent and paused for almost a full minute.\*

Me: Hello?

CK: Just do your job! \*She whispered in a hiss at me, as if she knew me personally and I was just being lazy\*

Me: Just a moment. \*I put the call on hold and look at June, who now bursts out laughing and says\*

June: Why is it always you? They always call on your shift.

Me: Glad to know I’m special. \*I said, deadpan, as Bruce’s monitor goes off, startling a grumpy Vet Joe, who was sleeping in the on-call bed.\* I don’t have time for this. \*I said as I take the call off hold, cup the mouthpiece and whisper “I knew you’d call here…I’ve been waiting for you.”.

CK screamed like she had seen her own end and slammed down the phone, never calling back again. June sat in silence for a good 30 seconds, trying to absorb what had just occurred, while I went to go check on Bruce. I could hear her laughter from the isolation bay.

For anyone wondering, Bob never got the puppies back. We reattached both of their tails. They made a full recovery and were later adopted. - And yes, Bruce survived the weekend.",2,1737647023.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False

She is older, around 60 and she typically is very brief as well as intimidating with everyone. 

So last week I'm talking to a coworker by the  coffee machine and I'm a hand talker.  I move my hands and arms a lot. Well, Sherri walks over and as I'm talking I accidently hit her in her boob. I was shocked as I didn't see her.  I looked over and she gave me a strange look then walked away.  

At this point I didn't know what to do.  I really didn't have a chance to process it and apologize.  I went back to my office really embarrassed ad my coworker saw it happen and she was kinda laughing about it.  

Before I had a chance to talk to Sherri she came in my office with some items I needed to sign.  I thought it was a good chance to talk to her but... she was a different person.  I've known her for about 6 months and she is typically very cold.  When she came into my office after the coffee machine incident, she was super nice.  To the point where she was flirting with me. 

It was so strange I didn't even want to bring it up since I've never seen her act like that.  Ever since she has been saying good morning and good afternoon, to me.  She has been joking around to me and very flirty.  She even made me some crafts for my office this past weekend and brought them in for me. 

My coworker came up to me this morning and even brought it up. 

I really don't know what to do at this point since I don't want to create drama.  It was a pure accident on my part.  I'm not really uncomfortable, yet, but I don't want to have this blow up in my face if I talk to her about it.  But i also don't want this to escalate further.

Sorry if this sounds a bit autistic, I'm not, I just want to plan and think everything through in advance to ensure it goes as smoothly as possible.

I'm looking to try approaching girls - chatting with them, maybe flirting if I figure out how, and asking for their contact info. I've never really done this in person, my primary goal would be to get used to it, learn to stop worrying and love asking out women. I'll try to focus on the process not results.

A disclaimer for start, women from my friend group are off limits for obvious reasons and none of them are both attractive to me and single at the same time.

I'll also be singing although I'm bad at it and cannot hit the right notes, so I doubt any will be amazed by my musical skills. As for my appearance, I'd rate myself as average or below average so I'll have to impress them with words coming out of my mouth.

My idea is to take opportunities to talk to people in general, of course focusing on women, but I'll be coming with a group, so I won't look like a weird loner. I'll try to be funny and get to know them better - ask them a bit about themselves. Then at the end, I was thinking of asking a woman, one of those I managed to talk to who doesn't appear to be in a relationship (or maybe I should try two or three if my chatting phase is more successful?), either for her contact information or directly suggest meeting for drinks.

So I'm looking to hear if you have any expert tips, advice and which of the following you think is preferable:

1. Ask for social media contact, chat with them later (about what though?) and then ask them out
2. Same as previous but ask for their phone number
3. Directly ask if they'd like to go out for drinks. Would the specific phrasing here matter (""would you have time for ..."" vs ""would you like to go out with me"") and also would the choice of beverage I'm inviting them for - coffee or alcoholic - affect my chance?

And lastly should I compliment them and how in any steps of this process?

I had been searching for an orthodox church for a while and when i finally found the courage to look up schedules i found that the closest church to me was having a coffee hour on my off day aka today and I signed up immediately.

When I went everything went smoothly and everyone was so kind. There weren’t that many people there, elderly women and me but they were kind and interested. They helped me through the prayers both the ones that were read and the ones that were sung. After that we had tea and Runebergs tarts, they answered questions that i had about joining and converting and gave me the full 2025 orthodox church activity flier.

1i861g0,https://i.redd.it/3qz49ox6jree1.jpeg,Is this potentially a cavity on the top of my molar?,"I 32F haven’t been to the dentist in quite some time (I want to say the last time was 2017-2018, hard to say because that dentist office was gone a couple years after that so I don’t have records there). I’ve never had a cavity, nothing other than orthodontic work. My dad was kind of a freak about our teeth so we had sealants, regular cleanings until I was kicked off his plan at 18, etc. The only health conditions I have is Graves’ disease (bipolar and adhd too but I’m 99.9% sure that’s not relevant at all). 

This discoloration on this one molar has been present for quite a while, these dark areas in the crevice. I don’t believe I experience any sensitivity - I can chew on ice on that side and be fine (not something I do but I did it to test sensitivity). 

I do still have all of my wisdom teeth because none were impacted, they just came through like normal teeth so what you’re seeing is the molar next to my wisdom tooth in case that isn’t apparent. This is the only tooth I can find with this discoloration in the crevice. I’ve poked in and around the top of it and (to me) it feels solid, I’m not feeling any pain. 

The only smoking I do is occasionally smoke marijuana, never smoked a cigarette. I maybe have a drink once a year. I’ll admit I am an avid Pepsi zero drinker, maybe have coffee 1-2 times a month because my stomach doesn’t tolerate it very well. It’s worth noting that I am purchasing dental insurance and do plan to find a dentist for a cleaning because what I really need is to look into orthodontic work again, some teeth have shifted I think partly due to some bad TMJ over the last few years and not having a retainer (that’s a long story).

I had to hire a new contractor for my kitchen project and it's been a very stressful experience. My kitchen is getting a full makeover and I know it's going to be a bumpy journey; I didn't realize it was going to be this irritating.

\-workers spilled coffee on the subfloor, barely cleaned it up, and placed plywood floor over it when still wet. The coffee even went down the floorboards and dripped onto my washer and dryer in the basement.

\-no one cleans up after themselves. when the dust from the sheetrock crept into my dining room, no one vacuumed it up. It turned the bottom half of my cabinet chalk-white. They left the door to the back porch open so now that whole room is covered in gray dust. 

\-there's joint compound/spackle smeared on the floor and wooden door frames. 

\-one of the workers didn't want to use the toilet in my basement, which is extremely close to the kitchen, so the contractor brought a porta-potty to my property. Before I signed the contract, I said I wasn't going to pay for the porta-potty since they had permission to use the one in the basement. Not two days later after the potty was delivered I had a random person come onto my property to use the toilet. Let's just say I scared the crap (hopefully not literally) out of him and he ran off. Even my neighbor yelled at him. The contractor had to buy a lock for the PP.

\-some of the workers have helped themselves to my water. My back porch is freezing so I've been storing some drinks and food out there like a second freezer. I may come off as an asshole for this, but no one asked if they can take my water and they wasted a few bottles, too. 

\-I am barely given notice when the workers are coming back. The contractor will tell me the painters are working Wednesday and Thursday, but then they work one day and no one tells me that they're not coming back on Thursday. So I just wasted a morning waiting around. Then they want to schedule someone to come on Saturday and when I say ""No"", they get all pissy with me. 

\-I ask a question about needing measurements for something so I can make an order and I get, ""We'll talk about that later."" As of now, I don't even know if anyone is coming on Friday to do any work.

\-this is just a me issue, but my dog and I have been growing restless and I'm personally getting cabin fever, too. I am not happy about all the cleaning I have to do because that dust is everywhere downstairs. ",2,1737646451.0,homeowners,17,0.67,False

I met this woman while I was single and both seemed to have a liking towards each other (though nothing between us ever happened years back), but I am worried about the current girl I am dating thinking the wrong way about this. I feel like my options are (a) mention it to her and and maybe she assumes I’m seeing her for other reasons, or (b) don’t mention it at all since I’m really not doing anything wrong.

I know it’s best to be honest, and being someone who worries a ton and has some pretty bad anxiety, telling her could help, but I just don’t want any negative backlash from her because I don’t think what I’m doing is all that wrong.

I could also mention to my friend who is visiting that I do in fact have a girlfriend, but I feel like I would be throwing that out there unjustly because she could just think this is a friendly meetup.

We talk a lot when we aren't together, and I find that jokes about him being broke has become more and more frequent, jokes about not having a job... now, this doesn't tell me anything about how we would fit in a relationship, but lately he has brought up more about his friends sending him money for dinner, dad sending things in the post, and even posted a Cashapp equivalent link on a Snapchat story.

I don't know if he's trying to say ""I can't support you that way"", because of the typical expectations around men (that don't matter to me, I have never asked for anything) or if he is subtly trying to suggest that I should be looking after him in that way. 

I am also someone who was in a part time, shitty job for most of my life and have a good amount of debt. In this stage of the not-relationship, I would never tell him about how I struggle financially, I feel its a very personal thing to bring to someone you have met twice.

My show ‘Night Vibes’ wasn’t exactly prime-time radio, but it paid the bills, and I got to talk about whatever the hell I wanted. 

Insomniacs, long-haul truckers, and the occasional stoner called in to chat about their weird theories or play requests. Most nights, it was the same old thing. 

Until the night Daniel called. And that call changed my life forever. 

It was close to midnight. The phone lines had been quiet for a while, and I was halfway through sipping my coffee when the line lit up. I hit the button, leaned into the mic, and put on my usual cheery DJ voice.

“Night Vibes, you’re on the air. Who’s this?”

“Mark, I’m calling from the future.” I heard a voice blare from the other end of the line. 

I immediately rolled my eyes and leaned back in my chair. 

‘Not another prank call,’ I sighed to myself. Or worse, this could be a conspiracy nut. I was about to hang up when the voice continued speaking. 

“Tomorrow morning at 7:42, there will be a crash on Highway 4. A delivery truck will turn turtle. No one will die, but it’ll cause a pile-up and lead to a ton of traffic on the highway stretching back miles.”

“Sure,” I said in response, smirking into the microphone. “You’ve got my attention buddy. What’s next? An Alien invasion? Somebody winning the lottery? Or maybe even a zombie apocalypse?”

The voice on the other end didn’t flinch. In fact, he stayed silent for so long that I thought the line had gone dead. Then his voice cut across the static, more resolute this time, carrying an edge of certainty that chilled me. 

“Check the news in the morning, Mark. You’ll see I’m telling the truth.” 

The line went dead before I could say another word.

But the next morning was different.

I woke up late, groggy from the long shift, and checked my phone like I always did, scanning the latest headlines. My eyes stopped at one in particular: *""Delivery Truck Causes Massive Accident on Highway 4: No Fatalities.""*

The timestamp read 7:42 am.

My stomach dropped, a shiver crawling up my spine. My hand trembled slightly as I stared at the screen, struggling to process what just happened. It couldn’t be real—but it was. The accident, the time, the place—everything Daniel said was true.

For the first time, I felt it: that creeping unease, like the world had shifted off balance. I spent the rest of the day replaying the call, trying to convince myself it was just coincidence.

 “People predict things all the time, right?” I asked myself, but deep down, I knew better. It wasn’t just a lucky guess. I tried to chalk it up to mishearing the time or imagining the entire thing, but the knot in my stomach refused to loosen.

When I returned to work that evening, I couldn’t help but wonder—would Daniel call again? Part of me hoped he wouldn’t, but part of me wanted him to call because I needed to know.

As I began my shift, I clicked to take the first call. ""Night Vibes, you're on the air.""

A familiar voice crackled through the line. ""It's Daniel,"" he said, calm and matter-of-fact. ""There’s going to be a fire tomorrow. In the basement of St. Mary’s Hospital. No one will be hurt, but they won’t find out what caused it.""

I felt a chill crawl up my spine once again. This time, there was no mocking reply, no sarcastic comeback from me. 

I was shaken, and Daniel could hear it in my silence. He did not laugh nor did he gloat about getting it right the previous night. He had simply moved on to his next prediction and that made me panic even the more. 

“Don’t bother warning them,” he added, almost as if reading my mind. “They won’t believe you. In fact nobody will believe you. They never do.” 

“What the hell do you want man?” I asked suddenly, my voice more aggressive than I had intended.

“You’ll see,” he said, in a matter of fact manner. “I’ll call again tomorrow.”

Click. 

He disconnected the call and was gone, leaving me speechless for the second time in two days. This was getting very frustrating now and also made me anxious at the same time.

I thought about calling the police, but what if they suspected me? If the fire happened as Daniel predicted, I could easily be blamed. But since he assured me no one would get hurt, I decided to wait and see if he was right.

The next morning, the news confirmed it: a fire had broken out in the basement of St. Mary’s Hospital. No one was hurt, and the cause was unknown. I tried to move on, but it was too real.

Paranoia crept in, making me feel like someone was watching me, like I was being manipulated in some twisted game.

But this time I knew he would call again, in fact I was certain of it. So when the third call eventually came in, I was already dreading it. 

“Tomorrow evening, Mark, at 7:34. A shootout will happen at Riley’s supermarket. One person will die from a bullet wound.”

 I clenched my fists as my heart started racing uncontrollably. 

“Why are you telling me this? Are you doing this all by yourself? Are you making these things happen? Are you so starved for attention?” I asked, almost yelling into the microphone. 

“No, Mark. I’m just telling you what I know,” Daniel replied in a calm voice. 

“You’re full of shit!” I snapped, slamming my hand down on the desk. “If you can predict this, why not stop it? Why not prevent people from getting hurt?”

There was a pause, then the voice came back, quieter this time. “It’s not about stopping anything, Mark. It’s about what happens after.”

“What does that even mean?” I asked, leaning into the microphone. “What will happen later?” 

But to my growing frustration, Daniel had already disconnected the call.

That night, I realized I could no longer keep quiet. I called the police, and told them about the shooting and the location. They thought I was crazy, but after some convincing, they agreed to station a patrol car nearby, just in case.

But I later learned I was in for more disappointment. The shooting had happened despite the police presence. The footage showed a body being carried out on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance. 

My heart sank.

I didn’t go to work the next night. I couldn’t. Daniel’s phone calls were gnawing at me, and I felt like a pawn in his twisted little game. Sleep was impossible; his voice kept replaying in my head: *“It’s about what happens after.”*

And I didn’t want to know what came after.

As I sat there in the dark, my thoughts spinning, my phone suddenly rang. The display flashed an unknown number. I hesitated, my heart pounding, but I answered.

It was Daniel.

""I thought you quit,"" he said, his voice dripping with mockery.

""Tell me what you want,"" I whispered, barely holding myself together. ""What happens after?""

“You’ll find out soon enough, Mark. We’re getting close now. I’ll call again tomorrow. But this time, it’ll be for you. So you need to be in your office for this.”

The line went dead, and I was left in a cold sweat. 

What did he mean by ‘for me’? This wasn’t just about some event I’d hear about on the news anymore—this was different. This felt personal.

I spent the entire morning pacing my apartment and staring at the clock. Each time I glanced at the phone, I half-expected it to ring, Daniel’s voice slipping through the static. 

By nightfall, I had made my decision: I had to go to the station. Hiding out in my apartment wouldn’t make a difference, and something deep inside told me Daniel wanted me there.

But I was in for more surprises. 

When I arrived at the parking garage, I was shocked to find my car missing. It had vanished without a trace, and I couldn’t fathom how. 

My heart raced as I noticed a strange figure peering at me from behind one of the concrete pillars. I caught only a glimpse, but it sent me into a panic and I began running towards the exit.

I ran all the way to my office, relief washing over me only after I finally locked the door behind me and sank into my chair.  The familiar hum of the studio finally provided some comfort, but it was short-lived. 

A couple of minutes later, the phone began to ring.

I hesitated, my hand hovering over the receiver. This was it. Whatever Daniel wanted, it was about to happen. Swallowing hard, I finally picked up the phone.

""Mark,"" his voice crackled through the line. ""I told you I’d call. Are you ready?""

“Yes,” I replied after a moment’s pause, determined to see this through.

“Very well,” Daniel said, his voice cold and detached. I heard a sound—like fingers snapping.

Suddenly, the TV in my studio flickered on and my jaw dropped when I saw video footage of myself sitting alone in my car, parked across from Riley’s Supermarket.

A police car was stationed ahead. I realized I was staking out the place, waiting for something.

Sweat dripped down my forehead as I watched two masked figures approach the entrance of the supermarket, guns drawn. In an instant, the police jumped out of their vehicles, guns raised, and gunfire erupted.

Horror gripped me as I saw a stray bullet hit my chest. I gasped, feeling a sharp, phantom pain as my body slumped forward, blood spreading across my shirt. The police eventually subdued the gunmen, but it was too late. My consciousness was fading.

When I opened my eyes, I wasn’t in the car. I stood next to a stretcher where my lifeless body lay under a sheet. Paramedics loaded me into an ambulance, while the street, now silent, felt eerie.

I stood in the middle of the road, looking around in confusion. What had just happened? I could not understand.

Then I saw him—a figure standing a few feet away. He had also been in the parking lot earlier, but now I could see him clearly. He had a human shape, but he wasn’t human. His form shifted and blurred, like a mass of grey fog twisting into something both familiar and utterly alien.

As the footage continued, I watched myself panic and run after spotting the figure. The scene abruptly changed to my family gathered at my grave, performing my final rites, while I stood invisible among them.

Suddenly, the screen flickered again, showing me waking up in my own apartment. The TV replayed the entire day’s events: me discovering my car missing, spotting the grey figure in the parking lot, and my frantic run back to the office. 

With that the screen suddenly went blank and the TV turned off on its own, leaving me in unsettling silence.

""Am I... am I already dead?"" I finally asked, my voice trembling, tears streaming down my face.

""Yes,"" came the calm reply.

I sat there, trying to process the truth, but before I could gather my thoughts, the phone abruptly went dead. That’s when I saw it—right there in the studio. The same grey mass appeared before me.

“Who are you?” I stammered, jerking back in my chair, fear taking hold.

“I am death, Mark. I’m here to show you what comes after.”

""What could possibly come after this?"" I asked, my voice heavy with lament.

“I want you to continue your job as a radio jockey, Mark,"" the figure replied, its voice chillingly steady. ""I want you to be a medium—for the voices that need to be heard. Use this opportunity.”

“Are you kidding me?” I shot back, desperation creeping into my tone. “Who will listen to me now? 

The figure didn’t waver. “Go open the door and see for yourself.”

With hesitation, I stood and opened the door. My breath caught in my throat as I saw them—hundreds of grey, spectral beings hovering in the air, their eyes locked on me, waiting. Watching.

“So,” Daniel spoke again, his voice echoing through the air, “what will you do, Mark? Will you do what is required of you?”

I looked back at him, fear filling my gaze as I stood at the edge of a difficult decision.

hi i know i know this is long overdue pero bumisita kasi siya sa dreams ko LOL trying my luck to find my concert crushie here sa reddit coz i've tried bumble, twt, fb & ig but to no avail. kahit sa hashtags grabe :(

so share ko lang sa inyo yung delulu moment ko last concert...

first concert ko to as a solo-goer at super kabado ako (social anxiety) hindi ko rin alam gagawin hahaha

so when i first encountered her nasa pila na ako papasok sa MOA Arena, there's this cute girl who caught my attention. siguro plus point na rin na she wears my fav color lol so nasa unahan siya ng pila, unang kita ko sa kanya side view lang pero nung umabante yung pila, i finally got to see her face. damn, ganda!! 😫 i took simple glances til our eyes met....twice!!! TWICE, ante!! (si oa si delulu) i restrained myself na hindi na siya tignan kaya walang 3rd time.

after that nasa lobby na kami ng arena dahil nasa unahang pila siya nauna na siya dun i plan to buy some snack muna kasi it was around 5pm
pa lang non eh 8pm yung concert. nung pipila na me sa snack booth nandun siya, nagkatinginan lang ulit kami, water nga lang binili niya eh after non nilibot ko muna yung hallways ng arena para hanapin kung anong door yung dapat kong pasukan later and nag cr muna rin ako. then nagstay muna me sa hallway sa gilid at kumain, then nung dumami na yung tao may hallway may mga guards na sumita kung san pwede pumwesto. marami pa naman space so pwede ka kahit saan dun lang me sa tapat ng 405 kasi yun yung nasa ticket ko...ang di ko inaasahan is lumipat siya near lang sa side ko like as in hahahaha langya kinikilig/kinakabahan pa rin ako kapag naalala ko to. like yung hindi mo alam gagawin ganong feeling 😭

anw ayan nga, i wasnt able to ask for her name or anything kasi sobrang nahihiya aq josko but we're both solo goer sa con that time based on my observation 🤣 since tumabi pa siya saken antee para akong naka-bombastic side eye kunwari kita ko kung ano username niya sa IG hahahahaha

I asked them why the other doctors didn’t prescribe it and they said maybe they were waiting for me to get better on my own???

I’m not sure why I’m here again, but I guess the December blues and almost hitting 30 might have something to do with it, lol. Anyway, I’ll get to the point:

I’m looking for something meaningful and long-term—starting as friends and, if we click, maybe seeing where it goes. Distance doesn’t matter to me; I believe anything can work if we both put in the effort.

**The Basics:**

* I’ve passed my healing era and am feeling emotionally and financially stable. I’d love to connect with someone who’s in a similar place.
* I’m working on getting back into fitness—taking care of myself feels great, and it’d be awesome to share that journey with a partner.
* Physically, I’m 5'7"", with brown hair and eyes, and I’m Latina from the Caribbean.

**Career Life:**  
I hold a Master’s degree and currently work in project management. I transitioned from a finance career that didn’t spark much joy for me, and I’m so glad I made the shift! I hope to meet someone who’s passionate about what they do—or at least finds satisfaction in it.

**For Fun:**

* I’m a traveler at heart—love exploring new places, trying new foods, attending concerts, and meeting people. Simple outings like a coffee date or grabbing a beer are just as fun.
* Secretly (or not-so-secretly), I fancy myself a pretty good cook. Let’s have a friendly cook-off sometime!
* I just built my first PC and have been diving into gaming—League, horror, co-op, strategy, survival, crafting… basically, I’m open to anything.

**Serious Stuff:**

* I adore children and hope to have some of my own one day—so it’d be great if you share that vision.
* Faith-wise, I’m Catholic, though not very strict about it. If shared values matter to you, that’s a bonus. If not, no worries—I respect other beliefs in friendships.

I think that’s enough for now. Can’t spill all my secrets at once, right? 😊

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Please include a picture if you’re comfortable—I don’t mind sharing one too. After all, a little spark never hurts!

No hard feelings if I’m not your vibe and vice versa—good luck in your search. (Though, for the record, I do love coffee!)

**Cheers,**  
xx

Literally like 300 students. There is a small coffee shop in the basement and I work there part time for $9 an hour. 

We work alone as it's small and there's times where no one orders for 30 minutes to an hour. All the baristas are students and we go on our laptops for homework, read a book, go on our phones, or listen to music on our headphones since there are no speakers in the area we work. Baristas will talk to their friends at the counter or just chat with people at the counter for a long time. 

I got over the ear headphones for Christmas and have been wearing them on one ear while working since the semester started. I sit doing homework until someone comes up to look at the menu and then I turn Off my music, stand up, and ask what I can get for them. I have a slight rbf so I try to smile when customers come up to order something or look at the menu. They order and then I turn my music back on to make the drink and not be distracted by some of the really obnoxious students yelling or something. 

The other day I was told by my manager that our boss doesn't want us wearing headphones anymore. I asked why since it's not really a distraction as people are on their laptops or phones when working. 

Our boss is older. He's also a dean at our school. He didn't like that people were wearing camo pants to class because camo is for hunting. 

My manager told me this:
""Yeah he doesn’t want baristas wearing headphones or AirPods because it makes the barista look unavailable. I understand where he’s coming from-it can seem like you are uninterested if you are wearing headphones and outside of a work setting it kind of signals “do not talk to me”.

He also isn’t a huge fan of having laptops out or doing homework while working, but the headphones he was particular about not having.""

My mom is his assistant and she said that he also thinks it makes people look like ""a punk"" to wear headphones...

I've seen and have been someone who walks away from wanting to order because a barista has been deep in conversation with a friend. I have never seen or had a barista look like they didn't want to talk to me because they were wearing one AirPod or having one headphone on their ear. 

Someone looks more uninterested deep in thought doing homework on their computer or going on their phone. A headphone simply is just there. 

This is going to sound very gen z of me but I went without headphones after that and it was hard for me to concentrate because this really annoying girl was yelling to other people in the room. 

I was also thinking ""what about when I'm cleaning up in the back? That makes me look uninterested and busy too...should I not clean up in the back then?""

People don't even like to ring the bell when I'm in the back cleaning 🙄

My mom said I should just talk to the boss about this because it seems illogical to take away something like that but not the other things. Also we sit there for half the time doing nothing until like 5 people come and order at once. I used to work the night shift from 6-10 and would get 2 people asking for water the whole time. 

The manager said he's looking for a speaker that can hook up to the music in the cafe part but that's not the same either... don't really wanna listen to ""coffee shop instrumental"" ""Christian coffee shop"" or the same short and clean playlist I  made for it over and over... 

Idk... this is probably silly for me to overthink but music, podcasts, or even an audiobook help me clear my head and get the job done as well as helps me to not be bored. ",0,1737645779.0,work,35,0.45,False

I will be moving March 1st to a new place. I do have the lease set to end on April 1st iny current place. I have seen many babies and 1 or 2 adults since August, the time of the first sighting. It has only been maybe 1 every 2-3 weeks until this week I have seen now 3 babies and 1 dead adult on a sticky trap I bought and placed under my fridge. 

I have Advion but not sure about it's effectiveness as I don't think I have a full blown infestation but seems to be the start of one and gotta be honest I'm kinda freaking out. The place I am currently staying is not the best at anything. Last year my ac unit went out, they came and checked it out 3 weeks later and said it was out, didn't fix it or replace it or anything. Also my fridge was leaking inside the week of Christmas. They came to look at it about 3 weeks later and did nothing.

I am only worried about moving and keeping the roaches out of my new place. And also that a full blown infestation could occur before I am able to move.

 What can I do to prevent them from traveling with me? 

What can I do in the meantime to prevent a full blown investation. 

Can I buy a ton of plastic bins and put my smaller electronics in it with alcohol paper towels (ps5, laptop, coffee maker)?

For my microwave, can I put it in a garbage bag with alcohol paper towels or should I just throw it out? 

I have unplugged the coffee maker and microwave for now and probably will not be using them again until I move. 

For my clothes can I put them in a bin and leave them outside since it's currently - 2F outside right now.

I have always been the structured one.  I manage all of our finances and I’ve always been the one who is organized, schedules everything, knows exactly what needs to be done in our children’s lives, etc…  My husband is very laid back and is very disorganized.  He is an electrical contractor so we own that business and it’s only him and 1 employee.  My husband has always struggled with being dedicated to a schedule.  He loves to sleep in and he wakes up and starts his day whenever he feels like it even though our employee always shows up in the morning and starts the day without him.  I have a full-time job that is not related to our business and I work 8:00 – 5:00.  I also manage the books for our business on the side.  I am very disciplined with getting up every morning and working out before my day starts.  I see the kids out the door for school and the whole time our employee shows up for work and starts his day while my husband is sleeping. 

When he does wake up he usually saunters around the house, drinks his coffee, and takes his time deciding when and what he’ll do that day.  There are often days he decides not to work at all.  It’s Thursday today and so far this week he has not worked at all.  When he decides to work he will often wake up and be out the door by 10:00 a.m. and he ends his day by 3:00 p.m.  We have talked incessantly about this, but he refuses to wake up and stick to a schedule.  He thinks I’m being ridiculous.  He’s even said he would be okay with divorcing me because it’s not something he will bend on.  I love my husband and I love our life, but it’s getting worse and worse all the time and I don’t think I can handle this anymore.  I am so devastated that he refuses to see how damaging his behavior is to our lives.  All other aspects of our lives are so good, but this is such a major hurdle and I am so resentful toward him.  Is there any hope or do we need to go our separate ways even though I do not want to?  Am I truly being ridiculous by requesting that he gets up and works more? 

Although we are financially stable due to my job it’s another thing I am resentful about, because we often have to borrow money from our personal savings to keep the business (he is supposed to run) afloat.  My husband fails to recognize that if he worked more we wouldn’t have to do this.  I feel like I am being taken advantage of and like this isn’t a partnership at all.  I need an outside perspective on this, because he is super convincing in regard to making it seem like I’m being a jerk.  However, I can’t imagine any woman would want to be married to a man who has this type of behavior? ",1,1737645637.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

In supermarkets, you can find it ready weighed and packed in plastic containers.
Traditional restaurants, for free of charge, would also serve a small plate of it as a dessert if you order coffee.

Recipe: The first crucial step it to roast the nuts. This will help bring out a richer deeper flavour which willl make our Ħelwa even better! In the meantime in a pot place together the sugar and water over medium heat. Bring everything to a gentle boil and wait until the temperature reaches 120°C. Place a candy thermometer so that you are precise with the temperature, this will take around 10 minutes. Whilst the sugar is reaching the desired temperature, in a separate bowl mix together the tahini, vanilla, salt and roasted almonds. As soon as the sugar reaches the desired temperature, stream it in gently into the prepared mixture and mix it in. Be careful not to over mix it.

The effect on my brain was way better than Wellbutrin, however my HR was in the range of 46-148bpm. No signs of palpitations. I was able to control my emotions. 

I took it at 4:30pm, but by 7-8pm I felt a sense of calmness, or too good to be true, checked my Apple Watch & noticed it was at 52bpm, rather strange for me with IST to go bradycardia, scared myself & my HR went up again.
Been drinking lots of water too. 

When it peaks at 5-6pm, it ranges from 120-130bpm. 6 hours after my dose is 56-123bpm. 

I saw my cardiologist in 2023, & did multiple ECGs, echocardiogram, angiogram, stress tests & tilt table test. My results were opposite from POTs, & my cardiologist suspected IST. Ivabradine helped to bring down my HR.
So far heart structure seems normal otherwise. Which was why I was cleared for stimulants.

I was put on Wellbutrin which didn’t work even after a month had passed, also it triggered a seizure aura. I had 3 past seizures due to deep deprivation from continuous gaming, & stress.
I quit smoking 8 months ago, reduced my intake of soda(with caffeine), & I don’t drink coffee. 

I’ll be seeing a new cardiologist in Feb. I’ve gone down to my GP multiple times who brushed me off, & said I’m fine, & too young to worry about such things, I notice many female patients like myself get told off as having “anxiety”. 🙄 This triggered my RSD.

They disregarded my concerns that my grand uncle(smoker), mom had a stroke. My grandma, g.grandma, & uncle(heart attack at 45), had cardiac issues & died.

They all pretty much taste the same to me.   I keep hearing people talk about their favorite ones with “notes of chocolate”’or wood smoke or toasty cereal etc.   I cannot taste anything but… well… coffee.  Literally every one I try tastes the same to me.  Don’t get me wrong, it tastes GREAT.   Just… if you put them all in a flavor line-up, I couldn’t rank one over another or tell them apart.  

Is this just me?  Do I just have a sh*tty palate when it comes to espresso?  Or is it an “emperor’s new clothes” type thing?

Basically for the past week I’ve been having diarrhea every morning at around 7-8am like clockwork, and this is very unusual for me. Before (my whole life) I’m usually the type of person to experience constipation, I very rarely ever have diarrhea. It started on the 11th, I had very bad diarrhea which I thought was possibly related to the Mac and cheese I ate a couple hours before. Then the next day I don’t remember how my BM was, fast forward to the 13th I started taking a new medication (Metoprolol for PVCs and POTs) while also quitting coffee cold turkey (I only really had one cup a day so not a heavy coffee drinker) and since then, I’ve been having diarrhea everyday. I’m so confused because I have no idea what’s causing it, my best guess is the Metoprolol. But since it started before my new medication and before quitting coffee I’m leaning towards something else too? I don’t know, when I look into this I don’t find many results of people experiencing the same thing with Metoprolol. Regardless I’m miserable, every morning is awful dealing with this.

“Hello?!? Earth to Beth, you're going to be late.” He said.

She snaps her wrist around to look at her watch.

“Shit.” She said, Without saying another word she scrambles to get up, nearly knocking over the chair in the process.

“I noticed you barely touched your coffee, so I made you a fresh one to take with you.” He said smiling.

“Thank you!! You're the best! What would I do without you?” She looked over at him, grabbing the cup from him with a big smile on her face.

I threw all the rest away,into the food scraps bin. 
I was quite literally feeling sick, trying not to cry, and like I'm making a horrible mistake, while doing it. 
I still feel like that, now. It's making it hard to enjoy this last buzz I have going on. 
This is very eye-opening. The way I'm feeling towards this, only shows just how deeply addicted I am to coffee, and why I need it out of my life. 

I want to feel better, mentally and physically. I have to come to terms with the fact that coffee just makes me feel awful, phsysically. 
I also have a lot of chronic health conditions, that have been getting worse, over the years. A couple of which are potentially fatal, and I need to be very careful. Coffee is just being careless, with that. 
I also have ARFID. I struggle a lot with being underweight and malnurished, due to lack of appetite, lack of interest in food, and sensory-aversion to most foods.
Caffeine only makes my appetite worse, and also causes dehydration. 


I'm in for a rough next couple of weeks, that's for sure. Especially, when quitting cold-turkey, like this. 

I'm going to try to get back into doing yoga, stretching, somatic exercises, and meditation, in the mornings, and afternoons.
Also, trying to eat food and drink water, instead of just drinking coffee. 
These are things I simply must do, because of my chronic conditions, and if I think I'm even going to make it past the age of 40. 
Right now, at 30, my body is literally falling apart. I am mostly bed-ridden, cannot walk, or stand without pain, and cannot take care of myself, anymore. Even lying down I'm in pain. I also have been having extra rythyms, with my heart. I'm being soon moved into a care home, because I can't manage myself, anymore. 

I'm trying desperately to fight for my health, now. And wanting to do everything I can, to keep things from declining, even more. 
Coffee is just not a good idea, anymore. 

As I'm finishing this, my stomach is already wrenching in pain, my chest is tight, I feel thirsty, my head hurts, and I have already had a very painful bowel movement (was not pleasant!). 
I did not feel this bad, only slightly bad, before I drank the coffee. I don't want to feel like this, anymore! I know it's harming my body.

I will make another post, in about a month, and update on how things are going, to hold myself accountable. 

Please, leave any helpful advice, or motivation for me, if you can. I really need it!
I have tried this, many times before. But this time, I really want to be successful, for the sake of my life and health.

I dated this girl for about six days a few years back. I had known her since middle school and as adults in our 20s we were talking for a month or two. I’d bring her coffee at work, we’d FaceTime and do our hair together in the morning and whatnot. But she was hiding a wicked wicked addiction from me. It came out when we were dating. And the final sixth day we were together, I’d already had my final straw. She’d cheated on me, used substances behind my back, and was really disrespectful. I found a bunch of mean tweets about me after the fact. The final straw was when she was planning a house party. And I was buying stuff to come over and make dinner for her before the party. As I’m at the grocery store she slowly starts backing out. Long story short she says it’s her cycle and she’s feeling sick so party’s off. Come to find out the party was on she just didn’t want me there so she could kiss other girls and use substances and not interact with me. Nonetheless she was my FP and I couldn’t let her go. 


It’s been three years. And I’m in a dead end relationship right now. My girlfriend now was my favorite person but she’s been so disrespectful to the relationship and selfish and she hangs out continuously with a girl she cheated on me with. I’m disinterested and now I don’t feel much for her. 

In comes old FP. She’s telling me how she went to rehab and got clean and she’s much better now and wants to go out for brunch as an olive branch where we can talk things through and she can apologize in person. We plan for 12 or 1. 12:20 I’m finally ready I dressed up as nice as I could. I text her I’m leaving. No reply. Drive 40 minutes to the spot to the other side of the state. No reply. Sit at the restaurant for 30 minutes. Not a word. Go to ulta and grab some things I need it’s now 2:15. Nothing. My feelings are starting to get hurt so my friend who happened to be delivering for Amazon in that area takes her break and we go out for a quick bite. 3:15 no reply. I’m hurt so I head back toward my house and stop at a shop on the way and pierce my ears. 4:45pm y’all. “Sorry I slept through my alarm I think it’s because I’m on my cycle” 

I’m not stupid right? It’s the same game again? I haven’t texted her back because my feelings are hurt and I feel like it’s the sixth day all over again. No way someone slept from 11pm to 4:45pm right? Every day we didn’t have plans she’d always text me between 11am and 1:30pm.

Partially because my father blackmailed and groomed my mother. 

Anyways: she hates him and she makes it very apparenty, especially now that I spend no time with him. My brother gets snarky comments when he spends time with him, I cut contact with my father. 

But still, she keeps stressing that I was always his fav kid, that I got this or that from him. I like my coffee with milk, she says milk in coffee is disgusting but that I drink it 'just like my father'. 

I have a line on my forehead and yesterday she joked that we should inject botox there because it looks weird and reminds her of my dad. She kept on pointing it out, how 'horrible' it looked with our dinner room lighting, how I got my eyes and forehead from my father. How much we should do something to get rid of that line. 

I hate how much she brings up my father about things she doesn't like about me ; I have a tendency to cut it close in the morning with getting my train - she says I always run late like him. I like to sing - I shouldn't be overconfident like him with music. 
Random things in life and suddenly I hear 'You do this just like your father, it's terrible' or scolding me while telling me I'm like him. 

He was a deadbeat dad and an abusive husband - I don't want to be like him but I don't want to feel like I have to get rid of everything that makes me similar to him. I'm different in the ways that matter. Just that physical comparison and joking how I should get rid of it absolutely hit me in the gut. 

And there are so many ways I am like my mum but not in the ways it would matter to her or in ways she would see - it only matters how much I am not like her and that she dislikes those differences; Movie preferences, interests, hobbies,, She was a bully and a jock and I am too much of a nerd for her that 'would I have been in her school, she would have beat me up'. 

I put in the work to not have their worst traits and treat people like they treated me and all she can see is the ways I fail her by being similar to my father and nothing at all like her. ",1,1737645134.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Brassica no more. 

This morning I entered my kitchen to make a cup of coffee and I saw a piece of paper on my floor thats been there for about a month- yeah, I'm living like that. I new what the paper was, its the Sauce description for all the sauces and dressings that are sold at Brassica. I had two copies of this paper posted in my kitchen so that I would unconsciously read it everyday. I picked it up today to toss it in the trash to discover on the back side is the date in which my Preview Shift was designated; 11/26. I looked at that, mildly shook- that can't be right, I thought to myself.. Shit, today is  almost the 26th. I don't follow the Gregorian calendar so well so at first I thought it was still December but just now I realized it is actually January 2025 so I held my position at Brassica for damn near two months exactly. 

There is a certain kind of pride that a man feels when he has a job. I don't know if this applies to all men or simply to dudes like me who have rarely had or held many jobs in my life but to be honest, it always feels good saying, I'm at work... I don't know. Its kinda bitter/sweet to be honest- (as a black man). You can't really have a job and not feel remnants of slavery and servitude, kinda like Stockholm syndrome; loving thy captor. I guess we all love the plantation from whence we herald and don't get it twisted, if you do a bit of research, you'll soon find that you too originate from some point of slavery- everybody been a slave at some point, but I digress. The point is I kinda felt good about that stupid peace of paper on my stupid kitchen floor with my stupid bosses stupid and erratic hand writing on it- he writes like someone who wears glasses but to keep it all the way gangsta,  I don't think this was his hand writing at all, the scribbled remains of my name on the template line where the date shouldve been reminds me of that fair and innocent, pale and ever so ginger treat who actually met me and filled in the blanks here on this template. 

It was one of those familiar occurrences that I have with white folks, especially females, when they are basically awestruck my little ole me. So smitten by the kid that she wrote my name on the line where the date should be- cute albeit innocent. It is an affliction that I have carried around with myself for most of my life; the spectacle that I am. It has proven to be a struggle for me here in a society where we judge every book by its cover.. A lot of people look at me and struggle to decide on my origin. I guess it effects everyone differently, a twenty two year old ginger treat may find me overly attractive while a slightly older white duck from a sheltered and slight weight backward environment may be equally attracted but due to her upbringing her subconscious response to such underlying appeal is to attack me. 

Its real easy for me to see when someone likes me and when someone hates me- I saw it pretty much everyday for the two months of employment I held at Brassica. That is the thing when you have overt ethnic features, like stunning red hair atop milky pale skin with a slender and silky build. But me, I just happen to be a big black man who reminds you of genuine, stately stature, noble posture and facial features that travel back to the beginning of time. With kind brown eyes, keen yet predator-like, with heavy, generous lips, complete and balanced darker, moisturized brown skin and sharp, high cheek bones hidden by a sparse beard. A man. A tall man that you would not immediately believe is fifty years old. A simple man who is well spoken, well read and articulate enough to express himself humbly.          

With each new day at Brassica I felt less welcome there even though I tried to fit in. It was not meant to be. Much like this entire country, external factors still holds great sway over where one can go, succeed and fit in. It says something about an environment and about the people therein when one can not fit it even when they are trying to. The longer I stayed there the more I felt I was being pushed out or pushed away and this mostly came from my superiors there but that is the thing about america; this perceived notion of superiority- people use their own idea of superiority to mistreat others. I know I was mistreated a few times simply because the counterpart had power over me and thats some tough shit to swallow! Being mistreated by someone for no other reason beyond the fact that she simply does not like you. Not because you're not a good working, not because you're incompetent, not because you are indecent or uneducated but simply because she thinks ""black people don't like to work"" you are mistreated at work when all you want to do is save money so you can one day move out of this country where this sort of treatment is so prevalent and normal. You wanna get away from white people and you never want to work where white people are your superiors because they have the power to simply fire you when you have an argument with a nineteen year old kid who identifies as they/them. 

It feels wrong. 

You feel it in your core. 

You feel robed. 

You feel raped. 

You feel stalled, like everything you want to do or planned to do has to come to a halt- they have the power to do that. 

They have the power over you. 

All you can do is move on because you know that this is the nature of this country, the white people have the power and if you don't assimilate you will remain outside of that power vacuum. 

What I have learned from working at Brassica is that I have to find an even playing ground when it comes to life here in america until I can escape. I gotta find a place that is not based upon the american standard of whiteness which in short is assimilation. I say this with respect to all and sundry but Brassica is one of the worst aspects of america and where we are going, if Brassica is a glimpse of the future then I need to leave because the life model that Brassica would like to project to us all is an illusion, its not real. If it was real, I would still have a job because my success would have been a factor that would have come into consideration before I was terminated but it wasn't. Brassica is not ABOUT my success or vitality, more than anything Brassica is ABOUT an image of what america is- it LOOKS like we are all getting along in harmony and this is true if you are willing to cross over into this american thing called whiteness. Look around right now, if you're at Brassica, everyone there is trying to be white, white is rarely fair at Brassica and here in america.   

Im fifty years old. I've been living in this country my whole life. You will never know the truth about any place until you have been at the bottom of a place. As a black man, I have spent a lot of time at the bottom here in america. Is it fair or even accurate for me to break it all down to simple compounds such as race and color- probably not completely but you know its deep how I can say this, kinda go against my own argument in hopes of being fair (even here in my own personal on rant) while the powers that be can't do it. If dude at Brassica would have been just a little fair, not completely fair- just a little fair, I would still have a job and not just that other people would still have their jobs there but it aint about that. Just like this country, the main and overall interest and concern is not mine or being fair; its not about the little people or justice- it ain't about that at all, its about power and the power to mistreat anyone when every you as a white person, a superior deems it fit. Superiority in america is not about being fair, it is about being about to hurt anyone you want and thats how I feel- I feel hurt. Maybe I was wrong, maybe I needed to be reprimanded, maybe I truly needed to be corrected, it just feels like that is not important at all. You work in a place knowing full well that there is little to no room for mistakes because you won't live to be corrected or to get it right or to be better, you are expendable, plain and simple. Thats life in america for a black man and its crazy too because we take great measures to avoid this and circumvent this reality; we try to live around it, so we don't stand up so tall, we don't talk so loud or if and when we do speak we try to sound as least hostile as we can so we imitate a white man, we try to sound like you, we try to act like you, we marry the kind of women that you would marry, we try to be just like you, just so we can fit in, just so you can think we are not as threatening as you thought we were on that first glance... 

One of the worst things about this country is you don't understand that I want the same things you want. I would have like to have felt welcomed at Brassica- that's the first thing. I would have like to have done a good job there too. I would have like to have learned more. I would have like the chance to be proud of my contributions... 

I don't know. They fired me with less thought than I have invested into these words you've read thus far so I hope this hits home with you in some way. Maybe these words and sentiments of mine will help you look at an employee a second time before you stop him/her from praying when he ask you if he/she can go to preform his salaah. Maybe this will help you think about the fact that you have the power to stop a man from paying his rent today. Maybe this will help you understand why the racial tension in this country is still alive. Things ain't gonna change for us on a racial level until we invest more time into each other and that means more than playing music that we all can agree on, its gonna take more than just sharing slang. Its crazy how Brassica encourages the workers to be friendly to each other and to the guest but the bosses can fire you over the smallest incident- thats because none of those cursory niceties are real. Everything real goes deep, everything real, takes time, everything real is an investment, real shit calls for sacrifice. 

Think back to the slave plantation. The slave master never had to be real or genuine with the slaves- not if hes smart. Thats kinda how I see it now when your supervisor is white- they don't have to be real or sincere with us because the nature of our association is not real. The reality of the matter is much like america as a whole Brassica is a corporation and a corporation is focused on one thing; profit. The people are parts of the machine. Parts can always be replaced.    ",1,1737645106.0,RantsOfReddit,0,1.0,False

A little about me:  
- I’m passionate about staying active, exploring nature, and capturing moments through my camera—especially portraits. If you’re up for a hike or a photoshoot, I’m your guy!  
- I’m a curious soul who loves learning new things and sharing ideas. Whether it’s tech, art, or life in general, I’m always up for a good chat.  
- I’m easygoing, open-minded, and value genuine connections.  

What I’m looking for:  
- Someone around my age (but I’m flexible!) who’s kind, fun, and shares similar interests—or has cool hobbies I can learn about.  
- Friendships to start, but I’m open to seeing where things go if there’s a spark.  
- I’m based in Italy, but I’m totally cool with online friends too. If you’re nearby, even better—we can grab a coffee or explore somewhere new together.

I've never been to the countryside before, only Dublin/Howth in 2010. We're hoping to find a good balance between seeing as much as we possibly can, but also taking time to just relax and enjoy where we're at. I've seen so many videos of people jumping to a new place every single day for 10 days straight, and then when it's over they probably look back and everything was just a blur.

**Wednesday April 2nd** – Land in Dublin airport around 11:30 AM, pick up rental car and drive to Doolin. Spend the late afternoon or evening hanging out by the Cliffs of Moher (maybe get lucky and see a sunset) then, spend the night checking out the local pubs/music scene. 

**Thursday April 3rd** – Have a low key day walking around the Cliffs again, if the weather's nice get on the Doolin Ferry and see them from the water and have another night in town. 

**Friday April 4th** – Drive from Doolin to Killarney (make a stop at Bunratty Castle and get lunch) get checked in and use that as our base for access to the peninsulas/National Park, etc. Have a chill day doing the usual touristy stuff like carriage rides through the Gap of Dunloe, Ross Castle, Muckross Abbey then hang out in town. 

**Saturday April 5th** – Catch a ride to Kate Kearney's Cottage or Cronins Yard to hike all day long in the mountains (any tips for how to get there?). Most likely just walk as far as we're comfortable going towards Carrauntoohil, I pissed myself just watching videos of the Devil's Ladder, but love to hike.

**Sunday April 6th** – Drive first thing in the morning to Dingle, have some coffee in town then drive around Slea Head Drive for the day, stopping at all the various places along the way. Then hang out in Dingle for the rest of the afternoon/evening. 

**Monday April 7th** – Check out and drive from Killarney to Dublin (maybe see Rock of Cashel or Blarney Castle on the way?) and then spend the last couple nights in Dublin – and fly home on Wednesday on morning.

I'm 25 and my fiancé is 26. We've been together for five years, engaged for almost a year now.

Important to know that the first three years were chaotic as I was suffering from undiagnosed mental healt issues while he was too insecure to be honest with me regarding adult movie issues. I dare say we were dumb kids with no knowledge about our own issues. We are different, I am talkative while he is not, I am outgoing while he is not. It was an issue, yet again in the first three years. 

Let's move on to the past two years. With great effort, but I got over the betrayal I felt for the secretive adult movie use. Also, I got diagnosed with severe anxiety and bpd. The funny thing is, as soon as it happened, something changed in me, I developed a ""why even fuss about something like this?"" attitude and my journey to become healthy began. We developed a really fun and healthy sex life in these two years. Although we can have opposing opinions, it nearly never turns into yelling or even raising our voices. We rather sit down, turn away from each other and get back to each other when we're both calm. I stopped fussing about activities with him and found peace and happiness in just being around him. It's like we can live in symbiosis. He does pretty much for me, drives me everywhere, makes me breakfast, brews coffee, picks things up for me, handles business, etc. Just like how I do it for him, I pack his lunch, I buy him the stuff he'd rather not shop for, etc. We give and take, 50-50 (I like saying 100-100 more).

My question came from a long talk among friends. They mentioned that I clearly need more reassurance and deep talking than my fiancé gives me and that they wouldn't trust him after he used adult movies secretly, and worse, his insta explore page was once occasionally littered with photos of women despite not him never makinga single like, comment or following. 

Frankly, I don't really care how his insta looked like 2 years ago when he doesn't even have Instagram anymore. I don't care if he still uses adult movies because our sex life is more than amazing, he's selfless, just like me and ready to try new things. He might not talk as much and deep as my friends, but he has my back still. He might not compliment me all day, but he for sure is not out partying among women, he'd rather be in his garage building his car or building something for me. So yes, he has traits that are considered shortcomings for me, like the lack of deep talking, but he's really a man I can count on and build a life with—just like how we're building our house at the moment. They question my thinking. My question is, is my belief something to rethink? Any insights?

Tl;Dr: My fiancé and I had a rough start with dishonesty and mental illness, he has traits that are considered shortcomings for me, but our relationship turned out to be too good for me to care about those things and I don't know if I'm delusional for that.

Before (my whole life) I’m usually the type of person to experience constipation, I very rarely ever have diarrhea. It started on the 11th, I had very bad diarrhea which I thought was possibly related to the Mac and cheese I ate a couple hours before. Then the next day I don’t remember how my BM was, fast forward to the 13th I started taking a new medication (Metoprolol for PVCs and POTs) while also quitting coffee cold turkey (I only really had one cup a day so not a heavy coffee drinker) and since then, I’ve been having diarrhea everyday. I’m so confused because I have no idea what’s causing it, my best guess is the Metoprolol. But since it started before my new medication and before quitting coffee I’m leaning towards something else too? I don’t know, when I look into this I don’t find many results of people experiencing the same thing with Metoprolol. Regardless I’m miserable, every morning is awful dealing with this. 

Anyone else have a similar experience? Also by the way I started weaning off Metoprolol yesterday so I’m going to be monitoring if my symptoms go away.",1,1737644714.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

While the gesture itself is meaningful, adding a personal touch can make it even more special. Here are some heartfelt ways to personalize the cookie packages for troops that will leave a lasting impression.

1. Include Handwritten Notes

One of the simplest yet most meaningful ways to personalize a package is by including handwritten notes. Whether it’s a thank-you card, a short letter, or even a quick note of encouragement, your words can brighten their day. If the cookies are from a group effort—such as a school, church, or community event—have children and adults contribute by writing their messages. Use colorful stationery or patriotic-themed cards to make it even more appealing. Don’t forget to include uplifting quotes or phrases like “We’re proud of you!” or “Thank you for your service!”

2. Decorate the Packaging

Make the cookie packaging as inviting as possible. Use decorative tins, boxes, or resealable bags and adorn them with patriotic ribbons, stickers, or drawings. If the cookies are being baked at home, consider using cookie cutters shaped like stars, hearts, or flags. Wrapping each cookie individually in clear plastic with a small ribbon will keep them fresh and visually appealing. Adding a little tag that says “Baked with Love” or “A Sweet Thank You” can make a big difference.

3. Create Themed Packages

Themed packages can make the gesture extra memorable. For instance, you could create a “Taste of Home” theme with cookies inspired by classic family recipes or regional flavors. Alternatively, a “Holiday Cheer” package with seasonal treats like gingerbread or sugar cookies shaped like snowflakes can bring a festive vibe. Themes help give the package a cohesive feel and make the cookies stand out as more than just a random assortment.

4. Add a Touch of Art

Including a bit of creativity can add an extra layer of warmth. Enlist kids to create drawings or crafts that can be tucked into the package. Simple things like hand-drawn American flags, colorful rainbows, or cheerful smiley faces can lift spirits. You can also include coloring pages and crayons as a fun, lighthearted surprise for downtime.

5. Incorporate Personalized Messages

If you know the specific troop or individual receiving the package, adding a personalized element can make it extra special. For example, you could include cookies shaped to represent their interests, like footballs or musical notes. If you have a list of names, you could even create cookies with initials or names iced onto them. It’s a small touch that can mean the world to someone far from home.

6. Include Useful Extras

Adding small, thoughtful items alongside the cookies can make the package feel even more like a care package. Items such as travel-sized toiletries, hand warmers, socks, or even fun things like playing cards or puzzles can be immensely appreciated. Tucking in packets of coffee, tea, or hot cocoa can also pair beautifully with the cookies.

7. Seal It with Gratitude

Before shipping the package, consider adding a final touch to show your appreciation. A small American flag, a ribbon tied around the box, or a label that reads “With Love and Gratitude” can make the package feel complete. These small details convey the care and thoughtfulness behind the gesture.

Conclusion

Personalizing cookie packages for troops is a simple yet profound way to express gratitude for their service. From handwritten notes to themed decorations and thoughtful extras, every small detail contributes to making them feel appreciated and loved. Whether you’re sending one package or organizing a group effort, these heartfelt touches can remind our troops that their sacrifices are recognized and valued. With a little creativity and a lot of love, your cookie package can bring comfort and joy to those who serve far from home.

1i8535k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i8535k/is_she_interested_in_me_or_not_is_this_going_to/,Is she interested in me or not? Is this going to go anywhere?,"So for some context, I met this girl on Hinge, a dating app and she seemed pretty cool and we had decent conversation but she had trouble keeping it going so lightly and sarcastically I said you’re really good at keeping a conversation going. She then said she isn’t good at texting which I can understand. 
I get her Snapchat and I set up a date, the first date is coffee and she sleeps in and forgets to set her alarm so I end up going home. She text me an hour later saying she’s sorry and that she slept in. Keep in mind we live about an hour away from each other so it’s not like it was just a 10 minute drive.
We end up going on an actual first date about two weeks later because I left for vacation. We had a good time, we walked and talked. Although I did notice that she didn’t really ask me any questions about myself, I was the main one who was creating the conversations. Although she did talk a lot when I did bring something up. At the end of the day, she said she was interested in a second one and I agreed.

For the second date, which was a week later, she drove the hour to me and we again had a good time at the zoo and then a local arcade. We ended the night with a kiss.

For the third date, I went to the town She lived in because I had a friend there for New Year’s Eve and had a party with him and his friends. That next morning we went to get breakfast. Had a good time talking for about an hour or two, but still mainly only asking her questions and not vice versa. Again we kissed when we departed ways. 

Now in between the dates, everything communication wise seem to be going fairly well. For context, we were snap chatting all day throughout the day and texting some and playing iMessage games when either of us got bored at work or during the day.
The day after New Year’s, which is when we saw each other last, we talked for a good 3+ hours on the phone. That weekend she went to a get together/party with her friends. She honestly was talking to me more than she seemed to be interacting at the party, which seems like a good sign. But after that night, it seemed like everything changed. She started snapping me less being left on delivered for hours at a time and no more instigating iMessage games.

The date we had planned for the following week she canceled because she said she needed a me day and she felt like she was running around, which I respected. Two weeks go by since the last time we spoke on the phone, and the communication style is still different than what it was for the whole first month. I’m starting to feel like this isn’t going anywhere, so I finally text her that I don’t feel like this is going anywhere. I just want to hear it from you, to which she replies “I didn’t think that”.
We end up talking on the phone later that night and I pretty much share how I’m feeling about the whole situation and she pretty much apologizes and says that that’s how she is sometimes when life gets overwhelming and she gets too stressed. She shuts down and stops responding to people. Ok makes sense. She says she will try better to initiate conversations and phone calls and be better at communicating when she’s overwhelmed or overstressed.

After that, everything feels better and on a healthier communication wavelength. I tried to plan another date that next week on a Wednesday because that’s when she had off work, but then work scheduled her for that day so I wasn’t able to see her then. I then see if I can come over and watch a movie that weekend , she says she needs to ask her parents because she still lives with them for school. Her parents say no and I don’t end up going up there.

During this time we have been saying good morning and good night fairly regularly kinda on and off. I decide to stop and see if she will initiate but she doesn’t and we just stop saying it altogether. I flirted with her over Snapchat and she seemed responsive to it and she likes it. 

What I’m having trouble with is, is this going to go anywhere? We haven’t seen each other in almost a month, and I feel like if she actually wanted to see me, we would see each other. She doesn’t initiate conversations, she doesn’t initiate good morning or nights, She doesn’t initiate questions about my day, she doesn’t initiate any flirting. Yet she says she likes me and that everything seems to be good between us. What she is saying is just not adding up to how she is acting. It’s low key been driving me crazy.

Am I the crazy one here and reading into this too much or is there actually something off here? We also have agreed we both want a long term relationship.

TLDR: I’m seeing this girl, we’ve gone on 3 dates and kissed a few times. She says she likes me and thinks we’re in a good place but her actions are not really reflecting what she is saying. We both want a long term relationship but it feels more like I’m dragging her along. Am I the crazy one and reading into this too much or is there actually something off?

And yeah, it turns me on. I’m not just talking about small things like coffee or notes (though that’s cute too)—I’m talking about money.

It started casually, like when I mentioned I wanted to grab lunch but didn’t feel like walking to the ATM. This guy I barely knew whipped out his wallet and handed me 30€ like it was nothing. I didn’t even protest just smiled, thanked him, and let it happen. From there, it escalated.

There’s this guy in my study group who always insists on paying when we go out for drinks. I’ll “forget” my wallet sometimes (don’t judge lol), and he just laughs and says, “Don’t worry, I’ve got you.” Idk it turns me on. Another guy? He literally bought me a new phone case because I mentioned mine was falling apart. I didn’t ask him to, but I wasn’t about to say no either. 

tbh it’s not just the gifts, it’s the way they look at me while doing it, like I’m worth spoiling. It makes me feel so powerful and sexy, like I’m in control even when they’re the ones paying. And honestly? I don’t feel guilty about it. They want to treat me, and I’m more than happy to let them. Recently that one dude asked me to pay me WEEKLY because he likes spoiling ”pretty girls“ and tbh that‘s just so hot.

being spoiled like this genuinely gives me a rush, and yeah… it turns me on. I guess I just love the attention and knowing they’re willing to do things for me without me even having to ask.

So this morning, as I’m headed into work, I pull up to a Tim Hortons drive-thru for my usual. 

Now, in this particular stretch to my workplace, there are two Tim Hortons located about two small intersections apart, but the one that I visit regularly is down for maintenance and so I, as well as many others, were forced to funnel into option B.

The result was a pretty packed house.

What makes this Tim Hortons location tricky is that it’s positioned at the corner of an already-busy intersection so there are two entrances; one far more convenient than the other.

This means people have to learn how to take turns, but the catch is that people don’t know how to take fucking turns.

So I arrive on the inconvenient side of the aforementioned Tim Hortons lot, and nobody is letting me in. Mind you, I’m pretty well backed off with my signal on, waiting for someone to let me in.

***Finally***, after waiting for several minutes, someone flashes me in.

What a good person! *Let me just pay for their order.*

I get to the window, pay for both orders and head off on my way, but as I’m exiting the area, I look back to find a blue Hyundai next in line.

***The car that let me in was a black Honda.***

Turns out they let someone else in after me too.

TL;DR - Paid it forward to someone at a drive-thru for letting me in during a chaotic hour. Attempted to buy their order, assuming they followed in after letting me through but it turns out that they let a second person in. So someone got two freebies today!

Regardless, enjoy your coffee, random stranger and I hope you passed on the good will to the guy who did us both a solid!

Hello and welcome to DevBlog #53!

Today, we have an announcement about the engine rework (and maintenance), extensive information about smart watch integration (including a survey), and some exciting news and sneak peeks related to in-game locations.

Also, we just posted a one year celebration post - if you haven’t already, [you can read it here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1i4u1r4/devupdate_18_first_year_of_walkscape/) Thanks for all the amazing comments ❤️

Let's dive right in!

# Smart watches

[Smart watch testing has begun](https://preview.redd.it/xk546xdn9ree1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2566eed36cb6baef4cf897f8d5533c78cce51ab2)

In a recent discussion on Reddit, players pointed out that because iOS implementation for smart watch support would already be possible, they'd like us to work on that. We've been holding off on this until Health Connect on Android is functional in order to release smart watch support for both platforms simultaneously.

I've been tunnel-visioned in thinking that in order to keep the game fair and not prefer some devices over others, we must release the smart watch support for iOS and Android simultaneously. Supporting smart watches would be quite easy for iOS at the moment, while adding support for Android might still take longer depending on how well Health Connect works and is updated by Google.

However, we're in Closed Beta and it would be good to build out this feature, even if only for iOS, and get it into testing. Having it integrated into the gameplay would also make supporting Android quicker later on.

We’d like to ask the community’s opinion on what our ideal proposed plan for smart watch integration is. We are opening a survey where you can voice your opinions on this issue, and it helps us to set our priorities again. This plan is simply:

* Develop and release iOS smart watch support in the coming weeks.
* Iron out bugs with the iOS community while developing Android support.
* Fix bugs, and release Android smart watch support when ready.

**Here are some points to take into consideration on this survey:**

* If you are just using your phone, there should be no difference in your gameplay.
* Developing and releasing the smart watch integration for iOS first would likely iron out most of the possible kinks and issues there might be when building smart watch support. This means that when Android smart watch support is ready for release, it'll likely be already quite stable.
* Having this released on one platform at a time makes it easier for us to troubleshoot, as we know everyone using this feature will be on iOS.
* Like discussed by many, smart watch support is for many people a barrier they've mentioned why they haven't picked up WalkScape yet. Having this feature on iOS might increase Patreon & BMaC support, making it easier for us to hire another dev down the line.

# Proposal: how would it work?

We've already begun testing smart watch support for iOS, and here are our current findings. We're exploring various options to ensure using a watch will be as easy and smooth as possible.

When you first open the game or visit the settings menu, you would be provided with the option to choose your step source. The phone is the default, and additional options only appear when other compatible devices are available.

In our current proposal, you can choose **a single source** for your steps—either your watch or your phone, but not both. While we'd like to offer more flexibility, we face several limitations:

* Apple Health calculates total steps from multiple sources, but using this total would prevent us from implementing proper anti-cheat monitoring. This isn't currently viable.
* Steps from third-party devices like Garmin come through their own apps (such as Garmin Connect) to Apple Health. We need to maintain a whitelist of trusted third-party sources, which works best with a single selected step source.
* Managing multiple step sources introduces significant complexity. Though we want to explore this possibility, implementing multiple device support would require substantially more development time.

For the initial version of smart watch support, we believe letting players choose one source—whether it's their phone, Apple Watch, Garmin Watch, or another device—is the most reliable approach.

# How would these options work on iOS

There are other technical limitations with smart watch support that we've found. These are iOS-specific, and might be entirely different on Android.

**Apple Watch**

Based on our current testing results, we can't poll your steps from Apple Watch in real time. There is some kind of limiting factor in Apple Health, and we'll try to see if there's a way around it. But at the moment, it seems that if you have Apple Watch selected as your source, you won't be able to see your steps update in WalkScape while the game is on. Steps would only be updated when you open the game (including bringing it foreground from background).

**Third party watches like Garmin**

Third party watch apps only provides third-party watch step data in around 15-minute segments (we’ve been only able to try Garmin Connect so far), and this data isn't available in Apple Health unless you go into the third-party app and sync it. So if you have a Garmin watch, for example, selected as the source, you would need to go into Garmin Connect and sync it for the steps to be counted in WalkScape.

# Implementation & development

That’s the result of our testing so far! We've already managed to put together a system into the game where you can switch the source for your steps, and those would count as your steps inside WalkScape on iOS.

The system still needs a bit of polish to be release-ready, but we would like to first hear from the poll and the comments to this development blog affirming if we should prioritize this now over other features. If that's a yes, we'll aim to release smart watch support in the next few weeks for iOS. We would likely also start more in-depth testing on Android to see if Health Connect is in a state where we could support it in-game.

I'd like to hear from you if the proposal for the system, especially considering the technical downsides, sounds good. Also, if there are alternative proposals for the design, we would love to hear them. One thing we've been thinking is that smart watch steps would only be used when loading in background steps, but the game would automatically revert back to the phone's pedometer when it's on. This way, getting real-time steps would still be possible.

Also, just to keep in mind—this is the proposal for an MVP solution we can put together quickly. We'll keep improving it based on feedback and what kind of solutions we might find. Apple will also likely keep developing their systems, which might enable better integration in the future.

# Engine rework announcement: release on Jan 29th, 14.00 UTC+0

We are finally finished with the engine rework and ready to release it!

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

* The maintenance will begin on **29th of January (Wednesday)** at **14:00 UTC+0**. Due to extensive infrastructure changes, server migrations, and other tasks, the downtime length is uncertain. We expect it to last at least 5–6 hours, possibly longer.
* Due to the complete rework of the game's local storage system, steps taken during maintenance will not be counted. Before maintenance begins, please open the game to claim your steps and verify that your character has synced to the cloud. You can confirm this by checking the leaderboards to see if your character's information is up-to-date.
* Our timeline may change. I'll keep you updated about any changes, with the most current information available on Discord.

This is the largest change the game has had from a technical standpoint so far — almost everything has been refactored, optimized, and tinkered with, including our server technology. I've never done this kind of massive migration on a production server before, so please *be patient* with us and be prepared that some things might go wrong.

Even though we've spent the last few weeks testing everything as well as we can, there will be new bugs and issues with the reworked engine. Sending us bug reports is much appreciated.

# Engine rework: what has changed

The game engine's functionality has undergone a complete rewrite. Additionally, I've refactored most of the game logic code and improved performance across nearly every aspect of the game. This improvement should be quite noticeable for players who have experienced slowdowns in the past.

**List of changes & fixes:**

* Server-side code is mostly rewritten. Authentication and saving the game now takes only a few hundred milliseconds, depending on your connection.
* Game engine is rewritten and now uses multi-threading for all of its processing. This should result in everything being much faster to process and the game's UI being a lot smoother.
* Anti-cheat is vastly improved. I'll not get into details on exactly how, but we've made a significant jump on our anti-cheat.
* Communications between the server and client are now for the most part both encrypted and compressed. This should result in smaller data usage, faster loading, and improved privacy from malicious third parties.
* Issues with steps not being counted when the game's loading of steps is interrupted should be fixed. With multi-threading, we're now able to cancel step loading with certainty when it's interrupted by an error, closing the game, and so forth.
* WalkPedia now loads very quickly with multithreading.
* A lot of previously reported issues and bugs have been fixed as well. There are too many of them to list here.
* Battery consumption of the game should be even less.
* Android version of the game now uses a new rendering engine (it's been on iOS for a while now).
* Character save system & save data is completely new. Player save files should now be around 12 times smaller on the server, so creating backups & restoring those is now easier and more cost-effective.
* Fixes to the Buy Me a Coffee supports not syncing up properly

**What's new**

* Gear sets have been added to the game. I still want to add a bit of polish to the system after this update, but it already works pretty well.
* In-game notification bubbles (drops, XP) have been reworked and improved. You can now see things like Realm reputation gains too.
* ""While you were away…"" has been reworked and improved vastly. You can now see much better what has happened while the game wasn't open.
* Added unequip all gear & tools buttons to the gear view.

**Testing Notes:**

* Opening the game from fully closed should now take less than 3 seconds (except for the first time logging in, which takes longer as that initializes a cache on server), regardless of where you are on the globe. Please let the team if you are seeing load times longer than this.
* There is now an FPS counter built into the game, found in the Settings menu. If you are seeing any lag in game, please send us a screenshot with the FPS counter turned on so that we can investigate!

# Engine rework: what does it do for WalkScape?

The engine rework as a whole took a significant amount of development time, so I'd like to also clarify its importance. I know many people might feel like the time spent on this was unexciting.

WalkScape started off as a personal hobby project, and to be entirely honest, at that point I didn't have as much knowledge in everything that goes into creating game engines. And often it's impossible to plan things ahead perfectly. Over the first year of Closed Beta, we saw some issues that were simply impossible to fix or improve with how the engine was set up (losing steps on network loss, for instance), and to improve the game's performance massively, we needed multithreading. To accomplish these goals, the way the game runs needed to be reworked completely.

It was a massive undertaking. We're now looking at nearly a thousand files changed and around 10K lines of code changed, removed, or added. The way the code is now organized and structured is also much better, which makes it easier to increase the size of the development team.

Doing these changes later would've meant that there would've been a lot more to rework into being multithreading-compatible.

But most importantly: now that everything in the engine follows a very clear pattern, adding new features should be much faster, simpler, and less error-prone. Previously, when adding new features, I often had to do a lot of maintenance on existing features to make it all work together.

I want to thank you all for your patience with this. Three months without an update was a long wait, and we know that.

# Going forward

In order to address the ""content droughts"" where new content practically can't be added to the game, we have a solution planned. We call this devtools 2.0 (we've mentioned those here and there before), and these are practically fancy tools that allow floursifter and maxchill to add content to the game without needing to do any programming.

We already had the ""devtools 1.0"", but those had design flaws which made them dependent on me building new updates and doing a bunch of manual tinkering whenever floursifter and maxchill had made changes or additions. And my time is often stretched thin on all kinds of things, resulting in a bottleneck. Floursifter and maxchill have already during this engine rework made several content updates worth of designs.

This is why I think after this update goes live, we need to shift our priority first to finish devtools 2.0. I'll spend the first couple of weeks fixing issues that arise with the update, but then I think we must get the new devtools ready. After that, back to roadmap.

What the devtools 2.0 will enable is that whenever floursifter and maxchill have new content ready, they can release it to the players without me needing to do practically anything. This means that our feature development pipeline is separate from our content development pipeline. Balance updates, content additions, and other things should arrive at a much more stable schedule.

I'd love to hear in the comments what you think. For the first planned content update, we only need the new tools partially completed, which I'm estimating would take me around 3 weeks to finish. After that, we can keep delivering content while I can also expand the tools while working on new features.

# Until next time

Needless to say, this devblog was really long! But there were a lot of things to cover, and I hope you enjoyed reading it.

We also really appreciate feedback on the things we covered here, and filling out the survey will give us guidance on how to implement the smart watches.

That's all for today—time for me to go back to making sure this incredibly large overhaul goes as smoothly as possible.

I met this guy online, we were mutuals on IG. He first chatted with me on New Year's Eve (I won’t specify the year). I only replied with a sticker. The first engaging conversation we had was in the second week of February. It stopped. But we continued talking since the last week of April. It became consistent. To cut the long story short, months passed, our feelings became mutual and we decided to meet at my place. On that day, he visited me and he stayed for weeks. As an observant person, I saw how decent, caring, and gentleman he is. And of course, we have had a lot of shared moments. Since then, we’re already dating. We’re quite away from each other’s place, so we were in an LDR relationship for a couple of months. We were okay with our usual routine of visiting each other every other month. I’d say the relationship we had back then is healthy.

Until I decided to work near his place. I met his whole family, they’re one of a kind. We always see each other every weekend. I always stay at his place during my days off. We became spontaneous, we loved going out as early in the morning and especially during nights. We loved spending our time on the beach; embracing the morning with a hot coffee, watching sunsets in the afternoon, and stargazing whenever it’s a starry night. At his place, we loved watching movies, reading books, listening to each other’s stories, and exploring recipes because we just love cooking! We also used to help each other doing the dishes, cleaning his room, and doing our laundry. And of course, like what most other couples do, we were active in our s*x life! We became so comfortable with each other’s company. We were in a peaceful situation, we never fought like yelling, cussing, or hurting each other’s feelings. We seem to be genuine partners in the long run. I know, we loved each other so dearly. The relationship we had those times is much healthier, or I’d say, “I thought.”

Jumping to the year 2024, we were still doing good until bermonths season came. I lost motivation to work, so I resigned. I stayed at his place for a few months. Everything changed. The warmth that used to linger between the two of us, became cold. Our usual routine, although we’re still doing all of it, became stagnant. My feelings, for some reason, I cannot explain why I always felt anxious. I had sleepless nights even with the idea of falling asleep fast just because I am on top of his biceps. The ambience of our surroundings slowly became uncomfortable as well. It turned out, I overthink a lot but I couldn’t figure out why, so I became silent most of the time. I started to speculate things, I became really curious that I even invaded his privacy. Checking his phone became my habit whenever he was sleeping, but there were no signs of cheating nor betrayals. I felt bad for thinking he’s doing me dirty. My mind was giving me a lot of instincts but my heart says otherwise. Until I slowly noticed my energy shifts and body changes. He used to be my strength whenever he was around, I felt energized. But then I slowly felt so weak and drained whenever he’s right beside me. I lost my appetite, I lost weight consistently. My skin became so sensitive, there were times I became so itchy right after he just kissed me. I used to think maybe I just developed a food allergy, but it’s not. My body reacted to a situation that my mind couldn’t figure out!

One night, he confessed everything. He had a hard time to finally speak up, but when he did, he said, “I have been avoiding touching this topic for quite some time, but I strongly feel that I cannot close my eyes to what’s going on. I lied since the second month that you were here (the entire time I lived near his place). When you were at work, I couldn’t stop drinking alcohol; I only stopped during the times you stayed here. I kept on watching girls on TikTok, and when I was in lust, I watched porn, almost every day while you were sleeping. I keep on looking at other girls whenever we’re strolling, I find them attractive. I know I messed up, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m not asking for forgiveness and a second chance from you. I just want to say sorry for being foolish, stupid, and a traitor to you.”

As expected, my heart shattered into pieces. Hearing those lines made me weak to the point I became totally emotional that I couldn’t even feel my anger. After his confession, he became completely avoidant. We broke up, and I went home.

The story does not end there! I thought he only disgusted me when we were still being together, but he disgusted me even after we just broke up. There’s this girl who approached me on IG. She told me stuff that made me question my ex-boyfriend’s whole personality. I felt like I only knew half of it; I never saw his dirty side. That girl sent me screenshots of their conversation. They were already talking three weeks after we just broke up. There were dark secrets in his past that he only confessed to that random girl he just met. And there were exchanges of conversations where they were actively flirting and inviting each other to do the threesome. They already planned to meet up. However, that girl is upset because my ex-boyfriend withdrew their plan and didn’t show up. I’m pretty sure that her intention was to reveal everything and ruin his image as to why she reached out to me; little did she know, our relationship was already in chaos. I didn’t fight her. I only sent her a single close-ended message two days later from the day she sent me DMs, and I blocked her immediately. I simply removed myself from entertaining a conversation.

Of course, I reached out to him. To make it short, I sent him a last message with my final words. He only replies with some sort of apology, thankful phrases, and good wishes for my future. He’s also hoping to disappear, he’s hoping I should hate him forever, and he’s hoping I’ll find myself a better man. The end.

My love for him led me believe that he has a pure soul. I didn’t notice him lying the entire time since I thought we were honest with each other. How ironic that he knows I’m a good woman, which is why his conscience consumed him until he voluntarily confessed everything. But I lost my favorite person. And he lost a woman that poured her whole heart. I still need some time, but this too shall pass, they would say. This is the pain I never felt in my entire life. I always thought he was my solace, but it turned out he became the reason for my grief. For now, I’m still learning to accept the situation that just happened. I’m still looking to move forward. And I wish nothing, nothing but my healing. Because I’m still here, stuck with his last gift, a pain I’m not prepared to bear. I still love him, but this time, it would be great for me to choose myself.

I've been trying to configure Windows file sharing and I have had no end of issues and have been debugging further to try get things to work. 50% of the time, neither device will appear in Windows Explorer. When it had, it would constantly throw back things about security permissions. I thought I resolved this, but when I actually NEED the files- It doesn't appear.

I've been into an unofficial discord and spent a few hours tryna debug in there but to no avail. the last solution i had to get things working was share to everyone, on private, no password was required. Kept kicking back it needed this, but on the security tab, I just wiped away any shred of safety and left it to share to everyone. Dangerous, but how else am i meant o get this working!? (i know, if i leave home it will be disabled for safety.. it is just trying to make it even work at this stage)

Today I had a look through my router settings to spot any issues I can see.  I remembered that in the network to the desktop pc, I had a network switch, tp-link TL-SG105E, which I had to edit the local IP due to issues of access.. but forgot the password. Easy Fix. Come to the desk, disconnected from the rest of the network, put in a pin to reset-held for 5s and now it's saying [192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) is an unreachable destination. Tried it again, replugged, tried different ports, and reset the desktop computer. Still the same. Tried this in edge/firefox/opera/chrome I've looked on my router and looked at the sticker on the switch for the MAC address and it doesn't appear, but plugged in, it allows internet traffic to pass through!?

From the desktop if I ping [192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) when only connected to the switch,                    ""transmit failed. General Failure""

How can I fix my switch?

How can I get a functioning, permanent, local network file-sharing feature (without buying additional hardware)

However, there was a time when you could ignore the downers and focus on a group's new album, concept, style etc. Now everyone seems to think they are a music critic, vocal expert, dance expert, PR/advertising expert. So instead of being able to enjoy a group or artists, they feel like they have to come out with these 'critical' takes about something. 

Kpop is first and foremost about entertainment. If you want to watch professional dancers, then please go watch professional dancers. If you prefer live vocals, please look up and follow indie artists who specialize in live vocal performance. 

Literally feels like every other post on reddit is ""so-so isn't singing live"" or ""i don't like this concept it feels corny"" or 'i don't like this dance'

And oh, he is…to everyone but my (now adult) son and me.

I have endless stories about how CN has purchased Christmas and birthday gifts for old women work pals he hasn’t seen in 30 years, sends cards to them for their birthdays, but mythically “forgets”/doesn’t have enough money to so much as acknowledge my birthday/my sons, pays for his coworkers meals and coffee constantly while bitching about our finances, etc. But instead of focusing on a hundred different instances of how well he treats coworkers and strangers while acting like I don’t exist or matter, I would like to focus on one.

CN has been a middle manager of two people, one of whom is his emotional affair crush (she’s been clear she’s not interest in him any longer). Nine-ish months ago, he took on a college intern, a young guy, who really needed the money. The intern was good at some aspects of the job, but he is constantly not showing up, coming in late, leaving early, and disappearing for an hour or more at a pop to go flirt with a girl in another department, taking 3-hour-long lunches, etc. 

There was an issue with the intern’s first paycheck. It was slightly delayed. CN decided he had to swoop in and “loan” the intern $500.00. In my world, that is a lot of money, and those sums should be reserved for family or very close friends who need help. Further, CN had just complained that we didn’t have enough in savings. So, I cut back on groceries and other necessities. Meanwhile, he’s out there flinging around $500.00 like it’s nothing.

The internship is now to be turned into a regular job within the organization and, of course, the guy is in no position to pay back this money. Ever. Just as I said when I mentioned my concerns about CN “loaning” this kid money.

Not to mention, CN’s boss is upset with CN. She does not want CN to hire the kid. As I mentioned above, the intern has significant issues with time and attendance. But CN insists no, no, he has to take on this kid as a regular employee because he “promised.” CN’s boss argued that the promise was based upon the intern doing a good job, which he has not.

This is the story of CN’s life. Lie down on the railroad tracks for coworkers. Pay for lunches, coffee, meals, and parties. Lavish them with time, attention, compliments, and money. Take on their workload because he’s too afraid to ask them to actually do their jobs.

But heaven forbid CN put a fraction of that effort into his marriage, or his stepson. Nope. All those White-Knighting behaviors and “being nice” are solely for coworkers, and his sister.

I find it revolting.

Andrew Ironclaw scowled at the mirror as he, once again, tried to make his hair somewhat neat. Two years ago, he tried to use mousse to make his hair all stylish like some of the superstar heartthrobs some of his classmates were swooning. He went through two whole jars with the only result being his usual messy hair but now tacky and smelling of citrus. Such is the life of a werewolf it would seem. But Andrew wasn’t just any werewolf, he was the son of the alpha. And with that came a lot of responsibilities, and it sometimes terrified Andrew.

But werewolf duties would have to wait for typical teenager duties. After one last futile attempt at hair maintenance, Andrew went down his stairs, grabbing his backpack that he always hung on the ground newel of the stairs. He turned the corner to grab a quick apple from the kitchen when his father grunted as a way of greeting. 

“Morning,” Andrew replied, placing the apple into his pack. 

His father, Titus, glanced over his copy of the *Veronaville Gazette*, seemingly studying his son before asking, “Football practice tonight?”

Andrew nodded. “Yeah, right after school. Coach is probably going to push us hard to get ready for the upcoming game with the Wildcats.” Hopefully, mentioning that it’ll be a rough practice could convince Titus to postpone any werewolf-related jobs tonight.

Titus grunted again in acknowledgment before adding, “Then be home by eight. We’ve got work to do.” 

Yeah, figures. 

Andrew sighed but knew better to argue. He instead just nodded and made his way out the door. Andrew understood why his dad was strict about these duties, he really did. But maybe his dad was too strict? He could allow Andrew just one night of leisure, right? Yeah, fat chance. Sighing once more, Andrew hopped onto his bike and peddled down the hill and into the morning mist.



After a few minutes navigating the windy roads downhill, Andrew reached the Veronaville Diner. The light of its neon sign cascading through the mist beckoned to Andrew like a lighthouse to a lost ship. With his stomach grumbling, Andrew made his way in, the diner already buzzing with early morning regulars. The smell of greasy bacon and hot coffee enveloped Andrew like a warm blanket. This must be what heaven is like. Do werewolves even go to heaven? Andrew knew better than to ponder existential questions like this on an empty stomach, so he slid into an open stool at the counter.

“Morning, Reggie,” said Andrew. Reggie Finch, the enigmatic owner of the diner, glanced up as he filled a coffee pot. Wearing his usual mismatched attire of a white dress shirt, black slacks, a tie with strange designs on it (everyday there was a new tie) and his mismatched socks, Reggie wouldn’t look too dissimilar to one of the hipster friends Andrew’s older brother, Caleb, had made while living in Seattle. The only thing holding him back from fitting in entirely was his age. 

“Morning Andrew. You’re looking like someone carrying the world on his shoulders again. Coffee or cocoa?”

Andrew smirked. He always appreciated how attentive Reggie was. It didn’t hurt that Andrew came by to the diner at least twice a week. “Cocoa thanks, I’ve got enough energy for now.” 

Reggie nodded and slid an already prepared steaming mug toward him, along with a plate of scrambled eggs and toast. “Big day?” 

Andrew shrugged. “Same as always. School, practice, then… family stuff.”

Reggie’s eyes seemed to gleam, “Ah, family stuff. Funny how that can mean so many things to so many people.”

Andrew looked at Reggie puzzled while the eccentric man went to refill coffee mugs. He didn’t have much of a chance to ask him to clarify when he noticed the time and immediately wolfed down his breakfast, left cash for the bill, and bolted out the door.



Andrew pedaled as fast as he could, jumping off as he reached the school and barely managed to lock his bike and dart into the building by the time the first bell rang. He quickly stashed his backpack into his locker and bolted to class, just managing to slip into his seat by the time the final bell rang. His teacher, Mr. Hardy, looked unamused at the young werewolf.

“Nice of you to join us, Mr. Ironclaw.”

“Sorry,” muttered Andrew as he sank into his seat. For some reason, he always felt that Mr. Hardy had it out for him.

Class went on while Mr. Hardy droned on about the numerous European conflicts in history, but Andrew’s mind drifted elsewhere. His muscles still ached from last night’s werewolf training, and he knew that tonight’s training along with football practice will practically leave him in a vegetative state tomorrow. But what will he and his dad be doing tonight? Maybe snooping on some vampires? Andrew had overheard his dad mention something about the vampires making a move. Was the Vampire-Werewolf War finally making its way to Veronaville? Andrew didn’t know what to make of that. Some action to break up the monotony would be nice, but could he fight in a war?

“Andrew,” Mr. Hardy’s voice snapped Andrew out of his thoughts. “Care to enlighten us on the significance of the Treaty of Westphalia?”

Andrew blinked, his heart sinking as the rest of the class turned to him, eagerly waiting for the inevitable crash and burn. “Uh… something about ending a war?” Mr. Hardy sighed while a few of Andrew’s classmates snickered. Assholes. 

“It ended the Thirty Years’ War and established the concept of state sovereignty,” said Mr. Hardy. “Pay attention.”

Andrew nodded, his cheeks burning from embarrassment as he ducked his head, pretending to take notes on the “riveting” subject matter.



Lunch finally came and Andrew quickly grabbed his apple from his back and made his way to the cafeteria where he knew Zane and Elias would be waiting. All three were members of the school football team but their bonds were deeper than that. Zane was Andrew’s closest friend who also happened to be human. Elias was a member of Andrew’s pack, more or less being his younger cousin. He eagerly anticipated the ribbing and teasing that will be had at their table.

But before he could enjoy his break, Andrew was stopped by his science teacher, Ms. Wheeler.

“Andrew,” she called, stepping out of her classroom and waving him down. “Got a minute?”

Andrew sighed internally but forced a polite smile. It’ll just be a minute, it’s fine. Zane and Elias aren’t going anywhere.

“Sure thing Ms. Wheeler. What’s up?”

“You missed last week’s lab report,” she said, handing him a folder. “I need you to submit the report as well as go over these corrections. Then resubmit it tomorrow during class.”

Andrew nodded, taking the folder. Yeah, like he’ll have time to get this done after helping his father out. “Sorry about that. I’ve just been… busy. I’ll get this done as soon as I can.”

“I understand Andrew,” replied Ms. Wheeler, her tone softening. “But I know you’re capable of more than this. Don’t sell yourself short.”

“Thanks,” he muttered before making his way to the cafeteria, clutching the folder like it was a lead weight.



By the time he made it to the cafeteria, most of the tables had filled up. Luckily, he spotted Zane and Elias at their usual table. Andrew quickly got his food and made his way over.

“Look who’s late again,” teased Zane as he balanced a French fry on the edge of his tray.

“Had to talk to Ms. Wheeler about some stupid lap report I missed,” replied Andrew as he dropped his tray down and stole the fry, Zane staring at him with a betrayed expression.

“Classic Andrew,” said Elias. “You can’t seem to stay on top of things lately, can you?” Andrew shrugged and proceeded to dig in finally. Zane and Elias then delved into another heated debate on the best quarterback of the NFL.

He wasn’t wrong. Between his nearly nightly werewolf duties and the growing amount of homework and projects, Andrew felt like he was being crushed. Was this what his life would be from now on? Constantly having to put out different fires with no rest? Is this why his dad is usually an asshole?

As Andrew was thinking about his predicament, his gaze lazily drifted across the cafeteria before finding its way to Theo Ravencroft. The school’s resident rich boy, Theo was sitting a few tables away, quietly reading. Despite being the rich kid, Andrew often noticed Theo being by himself or sometimes with his sidekick, Marissa Vancea. So, it was no surprise that he was alone nor was Andrew shocked to see no remnants of a meal. After all, vampires like Theo didn’t really need to eat in the traditional sense, they only did it as a luxury and to maintain their cover. The thought of Theo’s true meal almost made Andrew lose his own meal. 

Andrew studied the young vampire, his tall thin frame, his almost porcelain-like skin, and piercing violet eyes seemed to make Theo into an alluring and mesmerizing figure ripped straight from one of the Gothic novels that Andrew was supposed to be reading for Ms. Hayes’ class. And of course, his black hair was all neat and perfectly styled!

Suddenly, Theo looked up from his book and their eyes met. It was probably only a second, but time seemed to have halted for Andrew before Theo looked away, his face unreadable. Andrew frowned but he wasn’t sure why. It would be best if Andrew kept his distance from Theo anyways. If the war ever reached Veronaville, it would be expected for Andrew and Theo, both the heirs to their respective sides, to fight in the war, possibly meeting on the battlefield.

“What are you staring at?” asked Zane.

“Nothing,” muttered Andrew, turning his focus back to his food.



Football practice was as grueling as Andrew expected. Coach Barkley had them run endless drills, trying his hardest to make the team master teamwork and precision. His efforts weren’t for nothing, Andrew could notice the slight improvement in the team’s performance. He also could feel the bruises forming after repeated tackles. Finally, the practice was over, and Andrew made his way to the showers.

“Great work today, Ironclaw!” Coach Barkley said as Andrew ran by, stopping him mid-sprint. Andrew smiled and nodded before resuming his run. Despite the much-needed praise, Andrew’s mind wandered as the sun dipped lower over the horizon. He felt the pull of the moon, a subtle hum in his veins, reminding him of his true nature and the work that still needed to be done.



By the time Andrew came home, the last remnants of the sun’s light were beginning to fade as the moon continued her climb. As he peddled into the driveway, he saw his father waiting for him on the porch.

“You’re late,” said Titus, his voice stern and laced with annoyance.

Andrew glanced at his watch. 8:30. Seriously? Andrew sighed, “Coach kept us longer.” Andrew parked his bike and made his way up the steps, opening the front door and placing his backpack at its usual spot.

“No excuses. Let’s go.”

“Yes, sir.”

The two trekked deep into the nearby woods, the cool night air giving Andrew some relief from his exhausting day. As they walked, Titus explained what needed to be done—an inspection of the outer edges of the woods to make sure no creatures or other packs encroached into their territory. A simple task but one that Andrew knew would last a few hours. Joy. The werewolves made the route through the forest but again Andrew’s mind wandered.

“Andrew, pay attention,” snapped Titus when Andrew nearly tripped over a root.

“Sorry,” muttered Andrew as he refocused.

They came to a clearing when they spotted claw marks on some of the trees. Titus knelt to examine the ground beneath the marred trees, sniffing the area. “Fresh scent,” he muttered.

Andrew knelt beside him, picking up the scent thanks to his heightened senses. The moon cycles determined the strength of all werewolf abilities with the full moon giving them their most potent burst of power and the new moon at their weakest. Luckily for Andrew and Titus, the moon tonight was at Waning Gibbous. More than enough for their task to find the possible intruder.

“Most likely a solo traveler,” Titus concluded. “We still shouldn’t take any chances. Let’s remind them which pack lives here and mark the trees.”

Andrew grounded himself, his knees bent as he extended his claws and began marking the nearby trees while his father began setting up scent barriers. The two worked in silence save for the scratching of bark and occasional rustle of leaves as the two made their way through the trees. Normally the silence would be welcomed by Andrew were it not for the restless mind he’s had all day. Countless thoughts swirled in his head, but one moment kept repeating: the brief glance from Theo during lunch. Andrew never truly noticed Theo before; he didn’t really care much for him and his rich buddy Marissa. His aloofness always seemed to be more of a sign of Theo’s perceived superiority over the rest of the school, especially against the werewolves. And yet, he kept picturing his stunning violet eyes.

“You’ve been distracted all day, son,” said Titus, snapping Andrew back to attention. He winced, expecting another lecture. “Is there something you want to talk about?”

Well, that was not all what Andrew thought he would say. Is his dad actually wanting to have a conversation with him? Yeah, there is a lot on his mind. But what could Andrew talk about with his dad?

“Do you ever think…” Andrew started before hesitating. Is it even worth bringing this up with him? “I mean, do you ever wonder what life would be like to just…” he gestured to the woods around them, “Not have to do these things every night? That… maybe we can live out a normal life?”

Titus immediately stopped his work, turning to Andrew, their amber eyes meeting. “This is who we are, Andrew,” he said, firmly. “The world we live in, you can’t run from it. You have to meet it head on and deal with the repercussions afterwards.”

Andrew didn’t reply. He simply returned to his work all while the weight of his father’s words settled in, his heart falling.



By the time they had marked every tree they could and left as many scent barriers as Titus could bring, the moon was high overhead. The two made their way back home in complete silence. Once home, Andrew immediately retreated to his room, threw off his shirt and fell onto his bed, the need to fully disrobe melting away from the contact with his soft mattress. Every muscle in his body ached but he managed to turn onto his back and kick off his pants.

As he pulled over the covers, his mind once again raced with the events of the day—the judgmental gaze of Mr. Hardy, the heavy expectations hoisted onto him by his father, Coach Barkley’s praise, the fleeting gaze from Theo. He reached over and turned off the light on his nightstand, but not before giving a gentle kiss to the picture next to him. The woman on it forever smiling.

Andrew sighed, his eyelids growing heavy. Tomorrow will be another long day. But for now, he let himself drift into a dreamless sleep.",2,1737642787.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1i84mqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1i84mqo/i_feel_like_i_am_being_excluded/,I feel like I am being excluded,"What’s up y´all. I hope your day is better than mine. 
As the title states I (F, 20) feel like am being excluded by my new group of friends. We all recently started university (psychology minor) and our group formed like 3-4 months ago now. 
At first I considered myself super lucky to be in this friend group, since I never had any friends in high school. We started going out etc, grabbing coffee or food and up until like a week or two ago, everything was fine.
However for a few days now, I have been feeling that they don’t really care about me. 
There is this one friend that mostly acts nice toward me, but sometimes says passive aggressive things like: „Why are you always so critical/ pessimistic?“ This one time we were having a conversation with 4-5 people, someone else made an sarcastic joke after the same girl in the group said something and she immediately turns to me and goes: „Why are you always so sarcastic and rude?“ when i literally had not said anything and it was another girl that had made the comment.

With the rest of the group I don’t feel subliminally attacked, however whenever I try to contribute to a conversation, they do not really engage as much with me as they would with each other (or at least that’s my impression). Other instances of me feeling left out include them not paying me any attention when I have something to say, and just today they are all grabbing food literally talking about it in the group chat without even mentioning it to me once, not even inviting me too.

I do have a fair share of self-manipulative thoughts, such as „They do not truly like me“ or „They just put up with me because they wanna let me down slowly“, I have to be honest with myself and you, I guess (because of past experiences with other friends and other relationships).

What’s your opinion on this? Am I being crazy? How do I address this or possibly talk to them about it? I don’t want to be part of a group that does not value me, I also do not want to lose the only friend group I have.  Do you have any advice?

I'm looking for advice on my current skincare routine. I’m 22F with sensitive, combination skin (very oily T-zone with large, visible pores). I'm prone to redness and have lots of spider veins on my face. My biggest concerns are PIH and PIE which are very visible on my fair skin (I have a skin-picking disorder which I am working on). I breakout around my period, but I mostly deal with pore congestion on my nose and chin, and a bit on my cheeks. I'm thinking about laser treatment for my spider veins and stubborn hyperpigmentation, but I don't know much about it. Although my skin has improved a lot from regular retinol and glycolic acid use, I feel like I still have quite a bit of congestion, uneven texture and colour. My current routine is:

AM  
• Wash face with Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser  
• Apply Acnederm 15% azaleic acid  
• Apply Holika Holika Aloe Vera gel  
• Apply Q+A Amino Acid Oil-Free moisturiser  
• Apply Holika Holika Aloe SPF 50  
• Apply lip balm

PM  
• Remove eye makeup with Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water for sensitive skin  
• Remove face makeup with Face Boom Skin Harmony cleansing oil  
• Wash face with Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser  
• Apply TO 7% Glycolic Acid Toner (Every 4 days)  
• Apply Holika Holika Aloe Vera gel  
• Apply Apply Nacomi 1% retinol (Only on nights I don't use glycolic acid)  
• Apply Cerave PM moisturiser  
• Apply La Roche Possay Cicaplast Baume B5 (Only on nights I use glycolic acid)  
• Apply lip balm

• As needed: Pimple patches, zinc ointment, Help 4 Skin burn gel, Revox SA, Revox Alpha Arbutin, Nacomi green clay face mask on T-zone

• Extra info: I wear a full face of makeup daily and only use a beauty blender sponge that I wash daily (I use Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF42 as foundation). I generally drink 2 liters of water daily, take a multivitamin and magnesium, and aim to eat healthily with a vegetable-focused diet, but I do consume dairy (mainly cheese and yogurt). I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or consume coffee, and I'm on birth control. I change my sheets weekly and maintain a strict skincare routine. I use a different face cloth each day after washing my face. I live in Poland and have a student budget so that limits my product options to what's available here or in Europe.

They are stronger than I will ever be, and I think their children are so incredibly lucky. But as I neared the end of my maternity leave, the TikTok algorithm seemed to feed me nothing but this story. The story of the mom who, after her maternity leave, dreaded going back to work and wanted nothing more than to stay home. I was the complete opposite! I missed doing my hair and make up and wearing cute business casual outfits every day. I missed getting coffee and a breakfast sandwich on my way into work in the morning and rolling in to say hi to all my coworkers as I made my way to my desk. I missed the problem-solving and collaboration that I get to do in my role. I didn't miss the commute, LOL, but my gosh, I missed being a working girlie. I've now been back to work for a month, and I feel fully like myself again. I miss my daughter so much by the end of my workday, and when I get home for those snuggles and playtime and to give her her final meal of the day before rocking her to sleep and singing our songs and staring lovingly into each other's eyes, I experience a euphoria like nothing else. I really do believe that I am my best self and the best mom to her when I am working. This is the version of me that I want my daughter to see. This is the glow and happiness I want her to feel radiate off of me all throughout her childhood. Ultimately, I think everybody needs something different in order to realize the best version of themselves. For so many people, that's going to be living as a stay at home mom. For so many others, it's going to be living as a working mom. In an online space that for a while made me feel like I was alone in the joy, I felt when I went back to work, I just wanted to put this out there and welcome any other working moms who are loving their working mom life to come over here and share your success and happiness.

What do you think every time you see Ashley do standup? Whenever I see one of her clips, I think ""Ya... ShShunk is using her.""

Talent is sexy and Ashley has none. But it doesn't end there. She isn't pretty, interesting, domestic, nice, likeable... She's just rich.

But I'll stop talking about her relationship/attractive qualities or traits in a partner. Seeing Ashley's standup is upsetting because she has no talent and all of her audience members are GGE listeners.

Ashley has done standup long enough to have a following, but she doesn't. She just has an agent who gets her booked places she doesn't belong or deserve to be at and she's always the worst comic of any lineup (because all the other performers actually have comedic ability). 

Ashley, I understand why you would want to be good at something, something you thought you could do better than you're friend in Atlanta. But you have no talent and you will never be funny. 

Comedy shouldn't be a struggle, it shouldn't be like a constipated person trying to push a turd out. That's essentially what you were doing on stage, struggling to find a way to make an incredibly stupid bit funny. It wasn't funny, though. Nothing you've ever said has been funny. Nothing you'll ever say will be funny. You have NO TALENT. And I wish the people I knew who have talent had your agent. They'd be huge by now. You're a joke b*tch, for real. You're so terrible at standup and you should stop posting clips to confirm to the world how much you suck.

I will always say that flat Assley is a talentless hack. She looks down on people who make less than her, people who work hard, people who work in customer service and take a break to get coffee... She's a deplorable sorry excuse for a caring empathetic person and her fiance is using her. At least justice is being served in a way. 

I know I went too far this time, but it clearly bothers me that someone who got lucky time and time again (like when her parents repeatedly hired expensive DUI lawyers) would be so entitled and think they're better than anyone. Justice is also being served when Ashley is making a fool of herself on stage by attempting to be funny... Maybe she should keep doing standup... 🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣 I take back what I said babygirl. You're great at this! Keep going and you'll get a Netflix special before you know it!!!! 💀💀",5,1737641932.0,GirlsGottaEatRealTalk,1,1.0,False

I rush to get myself together and leave by 3:30 am. I get to work, down the rest of my coffee, and start my shift. Watching local news content until 9 am. And then wait around till noon for another ""shift"" and then go home at 1 pm. Two years of watching 6 hours of news a day, dealing with bumbling idiots of anchors who get paid probably more than quadruple what I do, listening to sensationalised BS, half the day, all morning... I'm at my wits end. I literally can't imagine doing this much longer. It's like torture to me for $15/hr. No benefits. No upward advancement. Everyone around me is sad/passive agressive/apathetic/annoyed. As am I nowadays. Ugh.",6,1737641931.0,work,13,0.72,False

I know it’s generally fine to have one coffee or tea with caffeine daily, but I’d prefer to avoid caffeine altogether. I’m not specifically looking for ‘fertility teas,’ just any general non-caffeinated teas that are safe to enjoy while trying to conceive. Any recommendations?
