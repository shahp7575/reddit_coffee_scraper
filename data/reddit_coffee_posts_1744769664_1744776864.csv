Used to get cavities all the time. But after I stopped using toothpaste five years ago? Zero new cavities.

Used to have a lot of issues with sensitivity. Any time I ate or drank something sour/acidic, I'd spend like two weeks avoiding any hard foods because chewing was painful. Now? Drink lemon water all day and don't have any sensitivity issues.

Was used to waking up with cotton mouth. Not going to say that that's completely gone away, but there are some mornings when it's not there at all and even when it is there it's way milder than it used to be.

Used to suffer from constant ""blackstain"" (google it, it ain't pretty) which would come back within days after every cleaning. Kept getting asked if I drank coffee or black tea or red wine. The answer was and is yes to all of the above, but guess what? Not the cause. Toothpaste was the cause.

I still brush, to be clear. Floss. Use baking soda every once in a while. But I sure as hell am not going back to using toothpaste.",0,1744776639.0,The10thDentist,1,0.33,False

Do they sleep between floors, remembering the people they've carried—or the ones they've taken?”**

Strange thought, isn’t it? But after everything that’s happened, I’ve started wondering: What if elevators aren’t just machines? What if they’re passageways… and something *else* is riding them too?

I’m not writing this for attention. Hell, I don’t even know why I’m writing at all. Maybe I just need it out of me, like bleeding out poison. This story isn’t something I want to carry anymore. Maybe, by putting it into words, I can leave some of it behind.

So here it is. What happened to me. Word for word.

It started ordinary—don’t they all?

I’d just landed a new job. Pay was solid, hours manageable, and after years of cramped apartments and Craigslist roommates, I could finally afford a place of my own. Something clean. Modern. Uncomplicated.

Nova Tower looked like the future—floors of steel, glass, and silence. No creaky pipes, no cigarette-stained walls, no nosy neighbors. Just polished marble, scentless air, and that eerie kind of cleanliness that feels… *surgical*.

They advertised their AI-run systems like a badge of honor. Climate control, automatic blinds, smart lighting that matched your circadian rhythm. But what caught my eye was the elevator.

“No buttons,” the leasing agent had said, beaming like it was the cure for cancer. “Just step in, and it’ll detect your destination based on your movement patterns, facial recognition, and biometric signals.”

Sounded cool. Slick. Efficient. I didn’t think twice.

But now, I’d give anything to unstep into that place. To un-meet that elevator. To un-know what I know.

It was late. One of those wet, miserable Friday nights where the sky feels like it’s trying to crush you.

I was soaked to the bone—suit clinging, socks squishing in my shoes, a sheen of cold crawling down my spine. All I wanted was a hot shower and the mindless hum of late-night TV.

I nodded at the night concierge as I passed. He didn’t nod back.

Just stared. Eyes bloodshot. Jaw clenched. Hands gripping the counter like it was holding him down.

I hesitated. Only for a second. Then shook it off.

Whatever. Maybe he was having a bad night.

The elevator opened with a sound like a sigh—low and long, not quite mechanical. I stepped in, ready to zone out.

But something on the floor caught my eye. A slip of paper. Lying dead center in the middle of the floor, water-warped, ink bleeding at the edges.

I picked it up, expecting trash, maybe a lost grocery list.

Instead, I read it under the flickering light:

**RULES FOR USING THE ELEVATOR AFTER 10 PM:**

* Only ride to even-numbered floors.
* Do not speak, even if someone talks to you.
* If the elevator stops at Floor 13, do not exit. Close your eyes and wait.
* If the elevator asks you a question, do not answer.
* Leave immediately if someone steps in without a reflection.
* If your reflection is wrong, blink... until it looks normal again.

I snorted. “Urban legends in Helvetica.” 

I remember smiling. One of those weak, half-laughs you make when you’re alone and weirded out.

But something about the way it was written—the shaky handwriting, the way “do not exit” was underlined three times—made my skin crawl a little. 

I checked my watch. 10:07 PM. Maybe someone was just messing around. Cute prank. Halloween must’ve come early. Whatever.

Still, I folded the paper and slipped it into my jacket pocket. Some part of me—a smaller, quieter part—didn’t want to just toss it.

Not yet.

The doors slid shut. Smooth. Silent. The elevator started moving. Nothing happened.

I got off on Floor 12. My apartment. Warm light. White walls. Normal.

But now… I look back at that moment like it was the last time I stood on safe ground.

They say curiosity is a slow kind of death. Not sharp and quick—but a whisper, a tug, a splinter beneath the skin.

Three nights later, it whispered again.

It was almost midnight. I’d stayed late at work. 

The rain was back—angrier this time. Like the sky was trying to peel the city open.

The city outside was still soaked, streets gleaming like oil, air thick and heavy with that end-of-storm stillness.

I was tired. But also… curious.

You know that feeling when you *know* something’s a bad idea but your brain whispers, “Yeah, but what *if*?”

That’s what happened.

I stepped into the elevator. My apartment was on the 12th.But the thought crept in. What happens if I *don’t* follow the rule?

I said nothing out loud. Just stared at the black glass panel above the door.

**15**, I thought.

I wanted to see what was on the 15th. There was a rooftop lounge—supposedly gorgeous views. I hadn’t checked it out yet.

So, I stepped in. Waited.

The elevator accepted the command. No sound. Just movement.

It ascended like a ghost—no shudder, no gear sounds, just a rising emptiness in my stomach as the numbers ticked upward.

**10… 12… 14… 15.**

The doors opened.

And the rooftop lounge was gone.

Black. Not dim. Not poorly lit. *Black.*

The kind of black that has *depth*. That feels like it's breathing.

I stepped forward instinctively, as if testing if the floor still existed. The air was freezing. A cold that bypassed my skin and latched straight onto my bones.

“Hello?” I said.

My voice sounded wrong. Too loud. Too swallowed.

No answer. Just my own voice echoing back—flat and dead.

Then—*tap. tap. tap.* Footsteps. Deliberate. Soft. Slow.

Behind me.

I spun.

No one.

The sound stopped. The silence screamed.

Then—closer this time—*tap. tap. tap.*

My heart beat like a sledgehammer. I turned again.

Still nothing. But it felt like the dark itself had teeth.

I backed away, breath short. I could feel it—*eyes*. Watching. *Smiling.* Not with kindness.

I lunged for the elevator, slamming my hand against the inside wall like it was a lifeline.

The doors slid shut. The elevator dropped.

And that’s when I looked in the mirror.

My reflection wasn’t… right.

It looked like me. Wore my soaked coat. Had my nervous stance.

But the eyes were hollow. And the mouth—

The mouth smiled.

Not in joy. Not even in madness.

It was a knowing smile. Like it had seen what I hadn’t yet. Like it was *waiting* for me to catch up.

I blinked. And everything snapped back to normal.

The mirror showed *me*. Just me. Sweating. Pale. Shaking.

But that wasn’t relief—it was worse.

It meant something had *gotten in*.

When the doors opened to Floor 12, I didn’t walk—I ran. Keys trembling in my hand. Door slammed. Locks clicked.

Lights on. All of them. TV volume maxed just to fill the air with *anything*.

I didn’t sleep that night.

But that was only the beginning.

Days passed. But something had shifted in me.

I started avoiding the elevator like it owed me money. Took the stairs. Faked phone calls in the lobby. Made excuses to stay out late or leave early—whatever it took to avoid those smooth, whisper-quiet doors.

I tried to forget. Told myself I was sleep-deprived. Stressed. Seeing things.

But I kept the note like It was a trapdoor warning. I didn’t throw it away. I couldn’t. Something in me *knew* it wasn’t just paranoia. 

Because Nova Tower wasn’t built for paranoia. It was built for compliance. And climbing twelve flights of stairs every day starts to wear on you in a way that seeps into your muscles and makes you careless.

It was a Thursday night. Nearly 11 PM.I had my laptop in one hand, a coffee in the other.

I gave in again. Late shift. Rain again. Exhausted. My logic overpowered the fear: *It was just a glitch. A fluke. An overactive imagination.* Right?

The elevator sat in wait like a predator with a velvet grin.

I stepped in. The doors closed behind me like a secret being kept.

The usual synthetic voice came to life:

**“Good evening, Liam.”**

Polite. Crisp. Neutral.

“Evening,” I muttered back, half out of habit.

The elevator hummed softly. Began its ascent.

But then, halfway up, it *stopped*.

Not a gradual slowdown. Not the smooth deceleration I’d grown used to.

It *halted*. Hard. Like the air itself had seized.

The lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then dimmed to a dull, sickly yellow.

And the voice returned. But different this time.

Lower. Closer. *More human.*

**“Liam…”**

I felt the blood drain from my face.

The voice was almost *gentle*, like a lover waking you from a nightmare.

**“Do you trust me?”**

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t. My jaw locked tight, throat dry as dust.

The silence after the question was unbearable. Not quiet—*expectant*. Like something was *watching* and waiting. Leaning in. Breathing down my neck.

Then again, slower this time:

**“Liam… do you trust me?”**

The air thickened. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. I felt like I was shrinking inside my skin.

I wanted to scream, but all I could manage was a whisper:

**“No.”**

And everything went black.

I felt it before I heard it.

The sensation of *falling*. A sudden, violent drop, like the floor had just given up.

The lights died completely. The elevator screamed—a deep, metallic howl like it was being torn apart from the inside.

I crashed into the ceiling, then the floor, then the wall, tumbling weightless in all directions at once.

My hands clawed at cold steel. My knees slammed against the ground. My head struck something hard.

Still falling. Still falling. Still—

Suddenly, **Silence.**

The elevator shuddered. Stopped.

Then—*ding.*

The doors slid open like nothing had happened.

Floor 12.

Lights normal. Lobby music playing softly through the speakers like I hadn’t just stared into the throat of hell.

I crawled out. Couldn’t even stand.

My chest heaved. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I gagged, dry-heaving on the hallway floor.

I stumbled back to my apartment and didn’t come out for two days.

But After that night, I swore I’d never ride the elevator past 10 again.

I tried taking the stairs for a while. Twelve floors. Not fun. But better than being trapped in that steel coffin with a voice that *knew my name.*

At first, I thought I could just avoid it. Use it only during the day. Follow the rules. Stay safe.

But the building didn’t care. The rules? They weren’t safeguards. They were… *agreements*. You break them, even by accident, and something *not human* notices.

And it doesn’t forget.

Subtle things started shifting. My apartment door would be ajar when I came home, even though I *knew* I’d locked it.

The AI butler would glitch, calling me by the wrong name: “Hello, Mr. Anders,” it’d say.

But there *was* no Mr. Anders.

The neighbors started acting strange, too. I passed a woman on my floor—Mrs. Greene, I think. Nice old lady, always wore bright lipstick.

But her smile was off. Too wide. And she whispered, *“Going down, Liam?”* Just that.

Not *hi*. Not *good evening*. Just that.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t even breathe until I was back inside my apartment.

I started leaving all the lights on. Music playing constantly. Anything to drown out the silence.

But it kept seeping in. The building had a way of pressing against you. Like it was trying to get *into* you.

I wish I could say I learned my lesson.

But the tower... *it doesn’t let you forget*. The elevator started *showing up* in my dreams.

Always the same: doors opening onto a hallway that shouldn’t exist. Flickering lights. Peeling wallpaper. And something *standing* at the far end, unmoving. Watching.

Eventually, life forces you back into routine. Even nightmares can become familiar.

I convinced myself I’d follow the rules. Never speak. Never go to odd floors. Never answer questions.

One night, When I was exhausted, sleep-deprived and barely functioning. I told myself: Just use the elevator. Follow the rules. You’ll be fine.

So I did. I waited until 9:40 PM. Early enough, I thought.

I stepped in that night, alone. head down, mind blank.

“Floor twelve,” I said clearly. Just once.

The elevator obeyed. Began to rise.

The numbers blinked upward. 4… 6… 8…

Then something changed.

The panel flickered. Buzzed.

The numbers scrambled—8… 10… 12… **13.**

**No.**

There’s no 13th floor. There *wasn’t supposed* to be a 13th floor. I stared in disbelief.

The elevator slowed. Stopped.

**Ding.**

The doors slid open.

What I saw… I still can’t fully explain.

The hallway stretched on forever. Walls the color of rot. Carpet worn to the threads. Water stains bleeding down the ceiling like veins.

And at the end—A figure.

Human-shaped. Completely still. Shrouded in shadows. Too far to see details, but close enough to *feel*.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

My instincts screamed, **Shut your eyes. Shut them. Don’t look.**

So I did. Tight. Every muscle locked.

The air changed. Grew heavy. Cold. Wet. Like fog creeping under my skin.

I whispered to myself, over and over:

**“Close the doors. Please. Please close.”**

The elevator groaned, like something ancient had to be convinced to move.

It felt like an eternity.

Finally—**click.**

The doors sealed shut, nearly catching my sleeve. The elevator rose. My eyes snapped open.

I didn’t see the figure again. But I *felt* it.

It’s like the thing on Floor 13 didn’t just see me…

It *knew* me.

Suddenly, the elevator took me to Floor 12, as if nothing had happened.

But my apartment door was already *open*.

And the lights inside? Already on.

I couldn’t go on like this.

I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating. Lost ten pounds in a week. My coworkers said I looked ""hollow."" I quit making excuses and started making plans.

Breaking the lease would cost me thousands. Didn’t care. I just wanted out.

I packed a bag. Grabbed the essentials. Left the rest.

It was past midnight when I headed for the lobby. The hallways were too quiet. Even the air felt tense, like the whole building was holding its breath.

I pressed the elevator call button with a shaking finger.

**Ding.** Doors opened.

Empty.

I stepped in.

As the doors began to close—

A hand slipped in.

The doors stopped.

A man stepped inside.

He was dressed too cleanly. Black suit, black tie, silver briefcase. No creases. No expression.

He gave me a nod. “Evening,” he said.

I nodded back, because *what else do you do*?

But something was wrong. Deeply, instinctively *wrong*.

The temperature dropped. A scent—coppery, like rust or old blood—drifted into the air.

And then I glanced at the mirrored wall.

**He had no reflection.**

None.

Just me. Standing alone. Even though he was two feet away.

My mouth dried up. My chest caved inward. My feet wouldn’t move.

Then he turned his head slowly toward me. Smiled. Just slightly.

“Going down?” he asked.

Not a question. Not really.

My body finally reacted. I launched myself through the doors just before they closed behind me.

They shut with a finality I felt in my spine.

I ran. Didn’t stop until I burst out into the cold, wet air of the city.

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t go home.

I didn’t even stop moving until my legs gave out three blocks away, and I collapsed on a bench, soaked in rain, heart still galloping like it was trying to escape my ribcage.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A notification: **“Nova Tower: Your elevator experience has been logged.”**

I stared at the screen until the rain blurred the text. I powered the phone off. Never turned it back on again.

The next day, I checked into a cheap hotel—curtains that didn’t close right, sheets that smelled like burnt plastic—but at least there were *stairs*. Beautiful, terrible, leg-burning stairs. No elevators.

I tried sleeping. Couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that hallway. The one that shouldn’t exist. The figure at the end. Waiting.

I heard footsteps in the silence. Felt eyes in every reflection. The city noise became a background hum, and all I could focus on was *not remembering*.

Didn’t work.

A week later, while drinking stale coffee and scrolling mindlessly through news apps, I saw the headline:

**NOVA TOWER RESIDENTS REPORT STRANGE GLITCHES IN ELEVATOR SYSTEM – TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN ANNOUNCED**

They called it “technical issues.” Said some residents experienced “floor misplacement,” “audio distortions,” and in one vague sentence, “non-physical presences.”

But no one used the word *haunted*.

No one said, *possessed*.

No one mentioned people stepping in and not stepping out.

Buried in the comments was a post from another resident:

“Did anyone else get that creepy note about rules after 10 PM?”

Someone replied:

“Yeah. Thought it was a prank. But my dog won’t go near the elevator anymore.”

And another:

“What’s on Floor 13?”

The post was deleted less than an hour later.

I still had the note. Crumpled. Damp. Stained at the edges like it had *bled* through the paper.

I flattened it out on the desk of my hotel room, smoothing it with shaking hands. Read it again.

Every rule made sense now.

Every warning was earned.

Every line wasn’t about control—it was about survival.

Only ride to even-numbered floors. Do not speak. Do not look. Do not answer. Leave if it has no reflection.

It wasn’t a game.

It was a **contract**.

And I’d broken it.

That night, I had the dream again.

But this time, I wasn’t in the elevator.

I was outside Nova Tower. Looking up.

The windows glowed red—every single one. Not warm light. Not fire. *Red*. Like the building had blood instead of wiring.

And from the top floor, something *watched* me.

Not with eyes. With intent.

Like it *knew* I was still alive. Like it wasn’t finished.

I woke up with tears on my face and the taste of metal in my mouth.

I moved three times in four months. Changed phones. Changed jobs. Told no one. Cut off everyone from that part of my life.

But it wasn’t over.

It never really is, is it?

Because about a week ago, in a building I’d never been in before, I pressed the call button for the elevator.

It arrived. Empty.

I stepped in. It started rising.

Then the voice came.

Soft. Familiar.

**“Good evening, Liam.”**

I froze. My vision blurred.

I hadn’t told the building my name.

I looked up. The display flickered.

**12… 13… 13… 13…**

And I realized something.

I never left.

Not really.

If you’ve listened this far, you’ve made a mistake.

You’ve *heard* the rules.

And the thing about the rules is—they’re like bait. The moment you know they exist, the moment they live in your brain, the game begins.

You might feel it already. That chill when you step into an elevator alone. That twitch when the lights flicker. That second glance in the mirror, just to make sure it’s still *you*.

It’s watching now.

The elevator.

Not just in Nova Tower.

**Anywhere.**

So, listen—If you find a note in your building with strange rules on it…

Don’t laugh. Don’t test it. And whatever you do...

**Don’t get in after 10 PM.**

Because once you know it’s out there, once you break a rule—even once— once the elevator knows your name—it remembers you.

**It never forgets.**

So next time you’re alone…

Next time you press a button, and the floor you land on isn’t quite right…

Next time you hear a voice ask:

**“Do you trust me?”**

Don’t answer.

I 24F and 26M met on a dating app. We've been chatting for about a month now. Both of us have pretty packed schedules, so we haven’t had the opportunity to meet in person until just recently.

Early on in our conversations by text, I shared that I’m waiting until marriage to be intimate—for a variety of personal reasons. I also told him that if he wasn’t okay with that, we probably shouldn’t continue talking. He said that he was fine with it, so we kept getting to know each other. By this point, it was clear to him that I value relationships deeply and that I’m not into hookup culture or anything casual. Not that there is anything wrong with that, just not for me.

About two weeks in, he asked if I’d be open to doing anything physical with a guy if we weren’t officially in a relationship. I told him no—that I’m only comfortable with things like holding hands, kissing, or hugging *if* I’m in an official relationship. He responded with “oh ok cool,” so I assumed he was okay with that boundary.

Fast forward to our first date—we decided to meet at a coffee shop and hang out for about two hours. It was a bit awkward since we were both clearly nervous, but we made it through. Afterward, as we were leaving, he reached for my hand, and I pulled away. I gently reminded him that I don’t do that unless we’re official. He seemed frustrated, and the vibe shifted after that.

We parted ways and are still texting daily, but something feels a little off now. So, AITA for sticking to my boundary and not holding his hand since we’re not official?

**Just to clarify:** I’m not part of a religion that restricts touching—I'm just personally uncomfortable with it. The only people I’m somewhat okay with touching me are family or those I consider close enough to be family.",0,1744776446.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

Our connection was intense, vulnerable, and deeply creative. We built a relationship across distance—talking for hours, creating shared boards, stories, playlists, even planning an in-person trip after months of building this together.

She told me I was the first person she ever said “I love you” to. We got so close that she said she’d move to where I live someday to be with me. She told me I made her feel safe in a way no one else ever had.

But shortly before we were supposed to meet, I spiraled. I noticed a bit of a withdrawal, and I reacted—just once, and not in a way that attacked her—but I panicked. With the trip coming up, I think I was just hypersensitive to any shift in energy. Classic 6 behavior. She told me she couldn’t give me what I needed. That she felt overwhelmed. That she needed space.

She broke it off and has gone completely silent since.

I sent her one final message—a calm, honest one. I explained myself. I told her I panicked. That it didn’t excuse anything. And that the truth is, she does give me enough. More than enough. That all I’ve ever wanted was her—just her. But I also told her she didn’t have to respond. That I respected her space.

And she didn’t reply.

And yet… she hasn’t cut me off.
	•	We still share our online boards and folders.
	•	She hasn’t blocked or unfriended me.
	•	I can tell she still checks subtle digital breadcrumbs I’ve left—nothing pushy.
	•	She’s still out there, quietly observing.

I haven’t messaged again. I’ve honored her silence. But I’m still planning to take the trip we were supposed to share. Not to force anything. Not to beg. Just to be there. Even if all I get is five minutes and a coffee, that would mean the world.

What’s hard is not knowing what this silence means. I don’t want to overanalyze—but I also don’t want to misinterpret a protective pause as permanent closure.

So to Type 4s (or those who love them):
	•	When a 4 goes quiet like this, is it always final? Or can silence be a way to emotionally regroup?
	•	What does it really mean when a 4 says “I can’t give you what you need”? Is that shame? Fear? A defense mechanism?
	•	What actually makes a 4 feel safe enough to return after retreating?
	•	What can a 6 do—if anything—to hold space without smothering?

I know we’re wired differently. I know I have a habit of scanning for danger when I feel someone pulling away. But this isn’t about chasing. I just care. Deeply. And it hurts thinking she might be sitting somewhere believing she isn’t enough… when to me, she’s everything.

Thank you in advance for any perspective.

Last week, I drank 2 cups of coffee at a hotel before opening the machine and seeing it was full of black in color mold. Got extremely sick to the stomach with extremely painful stomach cramps and almost had to leave work because of it. I have photographic evidence of the mold in the coffee makers.

Tonight I am staying at the same hotel and after filing an incident report, and checking into my room I noticed there is mold in the coffee maker yet AGAIN.

Is this grounds for a lawsuit based on negligence of breach of implied warranty of habitability?

Hi Charlotte! Looove your videos!!

just a disclaimer: Me k*lling my bf was in the dream. I didn’t actually k*ll somebody. 
also mini disclaimer, this is my first ever post and i may or may not type this up organized but i will do my best! 


My bf(35m) and i(28f) got together early 2024 and he had just moved into his new place. he got a nice 2bd 2bth, REALLY nice kitchen. I spent a lot in his kitchen cooking for him. sometimes i bring groceries in so we can do dinner dates. He works night shifts and does not get off until 3am so we barely go out on dates, that’s why we do dinner/breakfast dates at home whenever I’m sleeping over. I did not live with him because I also had just moved in to my own place when we started talking. I have a dog and would sometimes bring her over to his place and she loooves my bf. I should add that he does have kids and he would bring his kids to his place on his days off to spend time with them. He’s a great dad and he does everything for his kids, which is one of the reasons I fell for him. 

A little backstory, we met through work and i was going through something very traumatic and he was so sweet to me, a friend that was always checking up on me. When i noticed he was a little too nice, i confronted him and told him “you like me huh?” and that caught him off guard and he said yes. i rejected him because i wanted to be ready to let someone in. it wouldn’t be fair to be grieving and start something right away because he deserves someone who’s completely sure of herself and sure of what she wants. You know how some guys, when you reject them, they start acting totally different? Like they all go “well u ugly anyway. no one wants you anyway” because their ego got hurt? He did not act that way. He was very respectful and was understanding and still kept checking on me as a friend. Months later, with TONS of therapy and gym, I started to think of him constantly and i denied it at first but my best friend made me realize that i had started to develop feelings for him. She told me that whenever he would call me, she has never seen my genuine smile in a long time and that i deserve to be loved, especially after everything that i went through. So i gave in and gave us a chance. And we’ve been together since!

okay so around summer of 2024, my bf told me about a situation one of his homeboys was in and that he was moving in to his apartment. Pretty much his roommate was in a tough living situation, he’s got a kid, and my bf decided to help them out a little bit. It’ll only be temporary anyway, he said. The roommate is cool. He’s a cool guy. We’ll call him Leo. He’s a cook which i’m happy that we all know how to season our food and not just takeouts you know. When i met him, he didn’t have his BM around; he had his 1yr old kid (same BM- we’ll call her Cassie) and a dog with him. sweet little dog. Always humping on me though 😂 but at least my dog could play with another dog! but omg!!! they get soooo rowdy and makes sooo much noise, i only let them play together when we go to the park. The walls are so thin, one of the neighbors complained, i stopped bringing over my dog. A few weeks went by, and i come to learn that Cassie was about 7mo pregnant and that Leo has one kid with his ex but does not live with him. Leo was always talking about how he used to have the best life, the best paying job, that he had his own company, etc. but the pregnant Cassie stuck in my head like how would that work? i didn’t want to ask Leo about her because Im not the type to ask when i know that it’s a sensitive topic. so I asked my bf if his roommate had said something to him. and pretty much Cassie was not around but when she is, they’re always fighting and always yelling at each other so my bf does not come out of his room. that pissed me off. I remember saying “but this is YOUR apartment” but then he got me thinking that she is pregnant and her hormones would be all over the place. he also reminded me  that Leo is only there temporary and would be moving out by the end of 2024. and since we had conversations about when we do have a baby, we would be living together, plus he wants his kids to have a room to play in too. 

Cassie then gives birth and I am pretty much over at my bf’s place 2-3 times a week. But this was at the end of the year. So i asked my bf if they found a place because, well it’s the end of the year. and the fact that if you go in that apartment, my bf’s stuff are all in his room. everything else like the living room, it’s all his roommates stuff. Baby and kids stuff. so you’d think that my bf moved in with them. and pretty much it just looks like that’s all of the roommates stuff and are not going anywhere. my bf then said that it’s going to take them a little while because they just had a baby. which i understand. but i remind him that in the near future, the way we’re uknowwhat, im bound to get pregnant and it would be my first one and i don’t know sh*t about it. I know the basics and that i do not want to have to live separately, going back and forth from my place to his. 

i got to know Cassie pretty well. she’s a super mom. she’s always cleaning, always tending to her kids, someone you do not want to mess with, for sure. she had told me that she doesn’t have too many friends and she was so glad that i know how to cook. so we bonded over food, i mean who doesn’t, right? we got pretty close. when she makes dinner she would call me to come over and i would bring a little something as well. and when they have arguments, she would text me after apologizing. whenever they have arguments, she goes to a friends house and it takes her sometimes 4 days to a week to come back. i noticed that Leo does very little when she’s around but has alllll the energy to clean up when she’s not there. and most of their arguments (i know i can’t help but eavesdrop because like i said the walls are thin!! and she would tell me what they would fight about) is because she’s doing everything, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc while he’s just chilling in their room. and i felt bad for her. i would help them out by doing dishes and stocking the fridge with some groceries. Leo was doing volunteer work and then eventually found a good paying job. so at least he was working. (but tbh for me, he should still help out Cassie) the tough part is that they don’t have a reliable car. and whenever i do my groceries, i would text Cassie and ask if they needed anything- milk, fruit, coffee, anything. and she’s very thankful that i would offer. anything for a super mom who’s already doing so much and barely takes a day for herself. when Leo got the job, she was happy that he’s making progress and that they’re saving up for a car and eventually move in together because of their kids. she would do side jobs like remote jobs to make extra money. a super mom, indeed! i would also confide in her with my bf and i’s arguments. she gave good advice. she knew how to make me feel better about myself and that she’s pretty much a good friend at this point. the only thing that weirds me out is that she talks about one of her exes that looks EXACTLY like my bf, a homebody EXACTLY like my bf. and that when she first met my bf, she thought he was her ex. and she would tell me this most of the time. and i stopped telling her our business because she would just remind me that and it’s just weird to me. idk. 

january 2025, my bf and i found out that i’m (we?) pregnant, and yep, we knew that it was about time. we didn’t tell anyone except close friends and a few family. but we’re very much excited! i’ve always wanted my own kids. and he has been such a rock throughout this journey so far. At this point, i don’t sleep there as much anymore since i’m tired ALL the time. My bf comes over to give me food and would help me out with house chores or to walk my dogs for me. 

A month or two pass by, whenever im over at my bf’s, (almost everyday i drop by to have a little time with my bf before he heads to work) i noticed Leo would be there all the time. his shift ends at 5pm and doesn’t get home until 6pm, just in time for dinner. at first i thought, hmm maybe he took some time off. or maybe he’s sick due to season changing etc. but then.. with my newfound rage that comes with pregnancy, i started to get annoyed with him not helping his BM out with the chores. The dishes pile up quicker than before, mess everywhere. so yeah, somehow it irritated me. i also noticed that Leo would be in the living room, playing video games, even after i leave to get home, still on the same video game while Cassie is cleaning up or changing diapers or laundry, etc. so i called my bf during his lunchtime and asked him if Leo is still working and he said “nope” and i said “but yall are splitting the bills right?” he says “no. they only got the wi-fi” and i said “bro wtf. so u mean to tell me you’ve been paying for the whole thing the entire time they are there?” and he says “yeah”. Then i go “are you okay with that because i know it’s not my money but we’re about to have a newborn and im not okay with that” and he says “no im not okay with it at all. i just had a talk with them that they gotta go by july” 
if you can guess, i dont go there as much anymore because now knowing that my bf pays for everything pisses me off even more, i’m only there when my bf is there. 

it is now april and they have 3 months. last week, i had the dream. i know, i know, finally i get to tell the dream! sorry ab that hehe. 
so in the ✨dream✨ i was on Facetime with Cassie and i was chilling at my place with my dogs and she was cooking and telling me to go over for dinner. the facetime then goes into my bf’s room setting. she set her phone down so you can see the bed and she got on top of him and started to uknow. i rushed to that apartment so fast, grabbed her by the hair, dragged her a** down, beat her up and i get on top of my bf, punched tf outta him and somehow i was carrying a big ol sword and stabbed him through his bed like the frickin excalibur. but right when i stabbed him, thats when i woke up. it was as if i was the one that got stabbed. i woke up gasping for air and SWEATING. i woke up my bf and told him “i don’t want your roommates here anymore. you gotta kick them out” 
and of course i told him the dream and how Cassie would always bring up how he looks exactly like her ex and he says that that’s weird for her to keep telling me that. 


Ok so after writing all this down, i realize that maybe i am an AH. but since i took hours to type this up, i might as well share it. And if you’re curious as to what happens next, which i am too. I will give an update sometime this year.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/NIwAA4Hqrd)  **June 3, 2014**

This is probably a very common problem on here but I need either some advice or maybe I just need to vent/rant or hell maybe just told I'm full of shit and to get over myself.

High school sweethearts, each others first real relationship, lost our virginity to each other, stayed together through all of high school and until our senior year of college.

I was madly deeply in love with her. I know it sound cliche as hell but I was willing to change my future goals/dreams/desires to fit her. She was the first thing I thought about in the morning and the last thing I thought about at night.

One night after mind blowing sex she tells me that she has come to a hard decision. Long story short she tells me that she feels cheated because of being together so young in life that she feels like she has missed out. I try offering concessions about doing things together, whatever she wanted. Well she finally came clean and told me that it wasn't missing out on life activities that she felt cheated on but basically fucking other men (she didn't say it that way but its damn well what she meant).

I'm heartbroken. I mean fucking crushed.

I'm not proud of this but I had to go on anti depressants for a couple of years after that. I fell apart. I dropped out of college because I could not handle it (hey you don't have to tell me I'm a big pussy I know it already).

We separated and at first I made the mistake of keeping her on social media (facebook, twitter) and I swear to God there was a new guy almost every two weeks. So I finally got smart and just deleted her from everything. Not that it mattered to her but blocked her in every way that I could just to get her out of my life.

I moved, I tried to stay busy, I started a new hobby (RC cars if you can believe it, yea I'm just a big kid) and eventually with the help of my Doctor I started to get into shape. I guess I should point out that when I crashed I also just let myself go physically, I mean I gained 60 pounds and my diet was...well there was no diet to it.

I totally had no game with women, she was the only girl I had ever asked out and therefor never developed any skills in this manor. I did go out as friends with a couple of different people but it never really worked out, I'm still friends with them though.

Throughout the past couple of years I have ran into a mutual friend of ours (more her friend than mine) and I make it a point to not talk about her. But she (the friend) keeps bringing her up at the end of our conversation every time. Let's me know that she (my ex) was saddened that I did not keep in contact with her. I never really reply to her other than to say ""well I hope she is doing well"".

Fast forward to about a week and a half ago, I see the friend at one of our local markets and she is all excited to see me. Again remember we aren't really friends so this is odd behavior. She doesn't even let me talk because she is so excited that my ex is coming back to town and is going to be staying with her for a couple off weeks and that my ex has told her that she wants to see me.

I don't know what to say so I just say that maybe we will run into each other in town.

I try my best to avoid town that next week.

Both the friend and my ex show up at my fucking door. I live in a new apartment so they had to get my address from someone else because I sure as fuck didn't give it to any of them.

Of course I don't have a damn peephole so I open the damn door, had I known it was them I would have not opened it.

Anyway she fucking jumps in my arms and hugs me like a wrestler and tells me she has missed me.

My head is swimming at this point and the desire to call her a whore is pretty overwhelming but I manage to repress it.

After a few seconds of B.S. talk the friend says that she is going to leave so we can catch up. I beg her to stay but she was pretty adamant about leaving.

So the next thing I know my ex is sitting on my futon talking as though nothing has fucking happened.

I can't take it anymore and honestly was starting to have a panic attack, which I haven't had in almost a year and a half so I excuse myself to take a xanax (which I haven't taken in over a year but still had some left over from my last refill).

I come back and then she lays it on me. She wasn't just staying with our friend, she was staying there because she has an interview with a company in the next town over and was excited because she was going to be moving home.

This is the part where I want to shoot myself. She then tells me that she wants to get back together with me and that she has always loved only me. She said that her decision was right for her at the time but it was a pretty empty life and she regrets making that choice.

She was saying other shit as well but to be blunt I couldn't understand it, the more she talked the madder I got. She went of what seemed life a fucking hour but it probably was only 10 min. and I just sat there. She is sitting there crying like I should comfort her or something because of how her life has been shallow. So she is giving me this talk and then she say's that she hopes that what she decided didn't hurt me to much.

That was all I could stand.

I just stood up walked to my medicine cabnet in the bathroom grabbed all of my pill bottles and several empty ones that were in there walked out and threw them on the foot stool in front of her. I told her that this is how her decision didn't hurt me much.

She cry's for few minutes and then tries to talk to me again and asks me what my life had been like.

Well I the proceeded to tell her, I told her everything and I didn't hold back. I told her how I had gained weight, lost my future career, was depressed and at one point suicidal.

Then she asked me about dating people. When I told her I hadn't even dated anyone she seemed stunned.

So she came out and asked me about sex and when I said that I haven't been with anyone else she gets hysterical with crying. She thought for sure I was hooking up as often as she had.

We talked more and she texted her friend to come pick her up. She kept telling me how sorry she was and wanted to come back and see me the next day. I didn't answer.

She comes over and like an asshole I let her in. She tries kissing me but I don't let her, which she looked hurt but said she understood.

We sat and talked. I fucking hate myself.

We talked for a long time, I'll spare you the play by play, but in the end we were hungry so we ordered a pizza.

She stayed till it was so late that I had to tell her I had to get some sleep because I had to work in the morning. As she left she tried kissing me again, I wish to Christ I could tell you I didn't but I kissed her. She fucking smiled so big that we both giggled about it.

The moment I closed the door I started loathing myself. I just had a fucking date for all intents and purposes with the woman who destroyed my fucking life.

Today I have felt like shit all day long. I have sucked at work and I about wrecked my car twice because my head is up my ass.

I am in so much damn pain that this shit hurts as bad today as it did those years ago.

Someone please kick me in the ass and tell me not to consider taking her back. I am so fucking pathetic because worst of all no matter the time, the drugs or even the hate deep down in there I still for some god damn reason still think I love her.

That kiss was fucking electric to me and part of me can't determine if her smile was because she was happy because she wants to be with me or if it was a smile because she knew she got what she wanted.

I know she is going to be here later tonight and I am so afraid that she is going to break down the walls of defense that I have built up and I am going to make the biggest mistake of my life.

I will say this though in her defense, prior to the last night together she was the girl of my dreams and the person I wanted to live the rest of my life with.

Sorry this is so damn long, someone please talk sense into me.

EDIT: Our mutual friend came to my place this evening and said that my ex wanted me to have her phone number so I could call her because I still have her blocked from anything. She also wanted me to have something and proceeded to pull out a stuffed manilla envelope and handed it to me with another small white envelope that she told me to read first.

Basically the small envelope had a letter she had hand written today, she can't email me because I shut down that email years ago and she doesn't know my new one.

In the letter is her thoughts and hopes for us. She wrote a lot of stuff actually, all in all 6 pieces of paper front and back.

But the kicker was that she wanted me to have all of the letters she wrote me over the years hoping that one day she would be able to give them to me and that she had placed them in chronological order.

She also stuck in a couple of envelopes that had been returned to her because my address had changed without a forwarding address. There are literally dozens of letters some of which are much longer than the one from tonight and a quick glance shows me that she started this up almost the minute I moved back home.

I also found out from my Mother that she actually not only had tried to get my new address but actually showed up at my parents house looking for me almost 4 years ago and no one ever told me.

But as /r/boethius_tcop had predicted in her letters she called us soulmates and said she would do anything to prove herself to me.

I have made it through two letters from the past so far and I am stopping. I am making an appointment first thing in the morning to see my therapist again, this is just opening up all of my old wounds and I feel like every bit of progress I have made over the past couple of years is going out the window.

Edit 2 Hey guys I wanted to thank all of you for all of your messages, yes even those of you who called me an immature entitled fuckwad in a P.M. (you know who you are). I cannot believe the amount of replies this has generated and I have also received upwards of 30 direct messages to me, a couple of which are very heartfelt messages from a couple of older guys sharing their story with me. This all means a lot to me, it truly does.

I was able to get into my therapist today and it has helped a lot. I will post an update later if anyone is interested. I at least feel balanced again. I actually feel today like some of the weight I have been carrying for years has lifted a little. Some of it was therapy, some of it was her letters and a lot of it was /r/lateralus420 post from below and honestly some of it was from reading a site that was suggested to me called /r/theredpill. I'm not in line with a lot of what they are saying but some of that stuff hit home.

I am right now writing out my feelings, my therapist suggestion, and I am going to take the night and go see a movie just to get out of my apartment for the night. I'll be back later.

tl;dr: ex went to sow her wild oats, I fell apart, long recovery shattered by her re emergence into my life.


[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/UVaGkukq1I)  **June 5, 2014 (2 days later)**

I was going to just make another edit to the first one but that entire line has become so massive that I'm not sure people would even see it so I'll just put this update here.

I didn't sleep much if any last night so I called the therapist office first thing and was able to get in. I decided to take my packet of letters she had written with me just in case he thought we should go over them together.

It was a good session and when I left I felt a lot better, in fact I feel as good now as I have almost any day in the past few years.

He gave me several exercise to do throughout the day and one where I was to write a letter to her saying everything I ever wanted to say to her but I was never to give it to her.

Here is what surprised me though, he does not want me to avoid her. In fact he wants me to do the opposite, he thinks I have made her mythical and have given her to much control over my well being.

He is not recommending any change in my medication and he just encouraged me to keep a regular diet. Actually he was impressed with my weight loss since I was last there (I've dropped 40 pounds in the past year).

I asked about the letters and he said that if I want to read them I have to understand the context they were written in and that they can not influence my decision making process. He talked for awhile about how to accept the letters as more of a narrative and not an explanation.

Obviously I took the entire day off of work (I had time to burn so it was not an issue) and wrote down my feelings, the letter to her (It was kind of cathartic doing this) and then decided to read a few of her letters.
I'll get to her letters in a moment but I also knew she was going to try and see me tonight and I was not ready for this yet so I decided to go out and eat dinner and go to see the new X-Men movie. I highly recommend this movie btw, it corrects several of the horrible screwups of the X-Men last stand (sorry yes I'm also a nerd).

When I got home there was another letter taped to my door. She must carry a damn notebook or something with her because she obviously wrote this in the car when she figured out I wasn't there.

This one wasn't nearly as long but it was still pretty much the same message. She did say though that if I did not want to ever see her again I just need to tell her and she would not bother me anymore but she hoped and prayed I would not do this until we can talk more.


In writing down my emotions today I had an epiphany and really it wasn't that much of a shock to me but here it is.

I was writing down every single thing I felt about her and what happened and why she did it and why I never could move on and on and on.


Hate, anger, disappointment, resentment, confusion, betrayal, etc. were all words that filled a page and a half. I also put out why I had each emotion, which surprisingly the longest one was confusion.


But at the end of the second page the last one I wrote out was love. There was no denying it, no matter what she did how she did it or why there was a part of me that still loved her and I needed to stop running behind all of my other emotions to hide it.

But here is the twist and this is why I feel better now than I have since this all started. I also realized that who I loved was the girl from all of those years ago, the girl who said we would always be together and the girl who would get jealous whenever another female would talk with me (ironic as hell isn't it, she used to give me the 3rd degree whenever a woman would text me or talk with me about classes).


The person she is now is not that person that I loved. Oh she may still be physically the same person but emotionally as a person she is not the same.

Whey I wrote all of that out today I can honestly say that it felt like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. This person is a new person and I have to deal with her just like that.

After doing all of this I decided to read some of her letters. BTW I know that she actually wrote these over the years and not just at once because a couple of them she mailed and the date stamp is on them and others the paper is aged and she always has written the date on her letters.

I left campus very shortly after we broke up, I just couldn't handle it and was (Ok I'm very ashamed to admit this) suicidal. That is why I was on the medicine, I am okay saying this now although we never admitted this to outsiders. This is also one of the reasons my parents do not like her is because they are acutely aware of how I was (I spent enough time just lying in my old room).

The reason I even say any of that is that she started writing me these letters about 3 months after she left me.

She laid out everything to me in those letters very early on and she tried to come back to me. In fact one of the letters she had returned to her was pretty gut wrenching to read. In fact it upset me a little because no matter what she did I always did care about her and even now I do not wish physical harm on her. But apparently one of her new boyfriends, she claimed the third boy she dated after we split, one night beat her. I'm not talking smacked around, according to her letter he blackened her eye and ripped out an ear ring.

I know I should be a bigger person than this and in reality I am sorry that happened to her but there is a part of me that just feels like that if she hadn't decided to leave me this wouldn't be an issue. I never even argued much with her when we were together and I never would have hit her. Hell when she broke up with me all I could do was cry and make an ass of myself.

So I read more and by my best guess this trauma is what caused her to decide that I wasn't so bad afterall. Over the next few years she would write about wanting to get together and make everything right etc., etc.

So I read almost all of them, I have a couple left but they are newer including one she wrote about a month ago. One of the letters was her telling me how my Mom treated her when she went to see them. She said she understood my Mom's emotions and hoped one day to repair the damage that she had done to her. It also was pretty obvious she was getting desperate trying to figure out a way to contact me as the years went on.

So this brings me to the here and now and I've made a lot of decisions today on how I want to proceed.

I thought about this next part long and hard and each and every time I would think about it I came up with the same conclusion. I just asked myself this, if I got back with her would I resent her for what she did? Every single time I came back with the same thing, right now I would. Then I even went here, would I be able to accept that she has been with other men while I have never even kissed another girl. The answer is no, there is no possible way that no matter how hard I tried I just don't see where it wouldn't be an issue at some point in time. In fact if she even initiated sex I think I would be somewhat repulsed because it would make me wonder why all over again.


So with these things in mind and the knowledge that she is not the same girl I loved I have decided that there is no possible way that we can be together as a couple, right now. I say right now because I am choosing to look at this from another way as well.

I have decided that instead of running from her and still making her such an important figure in my life I am going to do my absolute best to forgive her and move on with my life. I know some are going to say that she doesn't need to be forgiven because she did nothing wrong. I am just going to respectfully disagree. She certainly had a right to do what she did but she didn't have to do it, she chose to do it and she knew what it would do to me. Now she didn't know nor is she responsible for how bad it hit me, but she knew it would break my heart. She even admitted this in the letters that she knew she did it and deeply regretted it.

One guy asked me in the other thread if she was wearing a ring on her finger and I never replied and I failed to put this in my first post but yes, yes she was wearing a ring on her finger. It wasn't a wedding ring but it was an engagement ring. We were engaged however it was going to be a long engagement till we were both out of school and had jobs. She gave me back the ring that night.

So I'm going to tell her tomorrow that while I am going to try to no longer harbor any resentment for her that we just can not be together right now. Maybe some day in the future I can continue to evolve or something but right now there is no way.

However I am going to leave her this olive branch, I will say that we can be friends to start with and I would be willing to see where it goes from there. I want to be able to see her without my heart feeling like it is being ripped out and that is for my benefit not hers. I think I need to see her somewhat regularly just to keep her from being something she is not.

Also you are all going to think I'm crazy about this but it is something I've thought about for a long time, well before she came back into my life. I am seriously considering joining the Marine Corps. I think I need the discipline and confidence. I've always admired the Marines and it would also be nice to serve my country. I spoke with a recruiter and surprisingly I qualify to take the ASVAB testing. While I dropped out of our college I did eventually finish my Bachelors degree.

I am really truly going to consider giving this a run. My job pays well but ultimately it is unfulfilling.

Either way sorry for the length of this and it is somewhat disjointed. I just want to thank everyone for responding and sharing with me. You have no idea how much it was the boot in the ass I needed to quit blaming her and realize that I need to fix myself.

tl;dr: Met with therapist, going to meet with her tomorrow, feel a lot better about myself and the future.

**Edit:  I actually posted this about 17 hours ago but it was apparently taken down due to some 48 hour rule.  There has even been more happen since this but I think this is more important so I'll just go with this for now.**

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/IYvDMywcud)  **June 11, 2014 (6 days after 1st update)**

Several things have occurred since my last update however things are pretty much evening out on my day to day life so I'm not sure from here if anything is worth updating going forward.

Last time I wrote I had stated I met with her but didn't really say what we talked about or anything.


I also told you that I set up a date with a friend. So as to not confuse anyone I will say that my ex's name is Susan and the new person is Jenny.

After my emergency therapy session, which we are going to continue once a week for awhile just to make sure I don't have any relapse, I did my exercises and did a lot of thinking. It allowed me to look at my life and the situation in general and honestly I decided from that day forward that I wasn't going to let this situation run my life for even one more second. I know I got a lot of advice telling me to not talk with her or whatever but the more I thought about it the more it just became clear to me that avoiding her, hiding from her or whatever else was doing nothing but me moving her to a hidden spot where I would not deal with her or the situation.

So I knew she was coming over so I called her and asked to meet her at a diner that we would not be disturbed.

We sat and talked for a long time. Honestly it was empowering to set across the table from her and not feel like I wanted to curl up into a ball and die.

I brought all of her letters with me and asked her if she wanted them back. The first thing she wanted to know was if I had read them all and I told her I did, every single one. She said she would prefer if I would keep them, which I said I had no problem with.

She wanted to talk about the letters, which I agreed to listen to her. She pretty much had poured her heart out in these letters and she wanted me to know that is how she still felt.

I listened politely. She talked a lot about her life post us and I never really asked her about anything because I figured it was none of my business. She kept wanting me to reassure her that she didn't hurt me and I just openly and honestly said that while it was not her fault how I dealt with the breakup I sure as hell was not going to tell her that I was okay with everything and that yes she hurt me like no other person has ever hurt me.

I was not mean about it and I was actually kind of proud that I was able to say it in a matter of fact type of way.

She wanted to talk about her life with other men after me and I told her that honestly I wasn't interested in hearing it. She was insistent because she wanted me to know how few (as though one more was somehow not enough) and how little any of them meant to her. Obviously she wanted to talk about being abused, which again I listened politely and intently. Obviously that guy and myself both reacted differently to her breaking up with us but neither of us handled it well.

She was Hospitalized for two days apparently with head injuries and such. I told her I was sorry that happened to her and that it wasn't right. I think she was hoping I was going to be a little more of something at that point but I just kind of waited on her.


We did some b.s. small talk as well, I know all about her jobs since then.

She wanted me to know that she was sorry for what happened and she tried blaming her new group of friends, which didn't even last till the end of her senior year, and I just politely told her that certainly outside influences may have impacted her decision but ultimately she is the one who chose to leave me, to see other men and explore herself. I didn't agree with it but at the end of the day had come to peace with the fact that this is what she had chosen to do but under no circumstance was I going to shift responsibility of this to someone else.

She agreed.

Then it came down to the here and now. I knew where this was going to go from the letters she wrote me.

She wanted to come back, she wrote that she tried to come back not even three months after she left, but I was gone by then and obviously my parents were running interference and not letting her see me.

I was as kind and polite as I could be with her but I just simply told her that I read the letters, thought about everything that she said and even tried to see if I felt like I could do it.

I was honest and just told her that while I had loved her with all of my heart and soul she shattered it when she left. I said that no matter what occurred that I just could not envision an scenario where I would not end up resenting her for leaving me to see other men. I said that would not be fair to her nor frankly to me either.

I did tell her about my theory of her not even being the same person anymore, which she did not really like this idea, but I told her it was the only way I could even sit her with her and not want to either rage at her or run off crying.


We talked a little more about my mental health, she obviously did not believe me the first time about not seeing anyone else and she was very upset that I had attempted suicide.

Then I just told her the best thing I could offer her was that I could be her friend and would be willing to see her as a friend, which I explained was a major breakthrough for me.


She was very disappointed and started to cry but then she shocked me by sitting up and saying that she wasn't giving up. I told her she needed to live her life and not wait on me.

She then said that she had decided that I had to explore the world but she was done exploring, she knew what she wanted and she was going to wait on me. I told her again that this was a horrible idea because I was not saying I would ever be anything more than a friend and that I purposely was going to start dating.

She just said that no matter how long it took she was going to be here for me and she was only going to be with me.
I decided this was backfiring to an extent but if nothing else she was no longer a larger than life figure.

I got up to leave and she got up with me, as I bent over to get the check she gave me a hug and reached up for a kiss. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and told her that I had to go. She asked me for my number to text me, which I went ahead and gave her.

As I was leaving I ran into Jenny and set up the date that I mentioned in the last post. We went to dinner and saw Maleficent, which was actually more entertaining than I thought it would be. We then went out to drink some coffee and sat and talked for a couple of hours. It was amazing to sit and talk to another woman who actually seemed interested in me. I was nervous as fuck because I had never been out with another girl in my life.

It went so well that we agreed to meet up the next day for a food festival that our city was having. We met at 11 and walked around all day, me trying not to eat my weight in food. She was just so easy to talk to, it was like I'd known her for years. By 3p.m. I could no longer say that I had never kissed another woman. We had been through the fair 4 times when it just became obvious that we were done there but didn't want to leave each other. So we retreated to another park for some music but neither of us cared for the band that was playing, so she invited me to her place to watch TV.

By 7:30 I can officially say that Susan is no longer the only woman I've ever been with.

Fucking amazing. It had been so damn long period that I about passed out when I saw her without her top on.

Anyway that is where my life is now.

I no longer harbor the hatred/resentment/anger towards Susan. I know she wants more but right now we are just friends. Jenny is amazing but I am not going to jump head first because I am just not that familiar with dating in general so I'm taking it one day at a time from here.

Oh one last little bit before I sign off. I met with the recruiter again on Monday and I got a cool guy who just shot straight with me. He told me that with my history of mental health issues that they would tell me to take the testing but the truth was they were never going to accept me in OCS and that in this day and age even basic might not be available.

It was kind of harsh but I appreciated him telling me like it was. I still respect the hell out of those guys but if I want something more its going to have to come from here. I've got some ideas but we will see what pans out.

Anyway thanks everyone for suffering through my shit and anxiety. I've still got a road to go for recovery but I can honestly say for the first time for real that I am going to get there.

With all of the above in mind and I know I have gotten a lot of comments regarding whether or not I should continue to see Susan as a friend.  My question is how soon should I share all of this information with Jenny?  I kind of told her that I had a previous ex but she knows nothing about the extent of it all. 

When should I bring up my severe depression and frankly my suicide attempt?  I am deeply ashamed by it all now and I would really rather not tell anyone, however I think she has a right to know if she is going to develop feelings for me.


Tl;DR: Met with ex, went on date with new friend, life is much improved.

**EDIT:  I apologize to everyone because my first posting of this was removed because I did not read the new rule that disallowed updates without seeking further guidance.  With that in mind I have added a question to the bottom of this update that I would like some guidance on.  Again I'm sorry for not following the new rules, thanks**

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/S4P7ECEnQB)  **Sept 2, 2014 (3 months after 1st post)**

Hey guys, 

It's been a couple of months and I kind of thought nobody was interested in how things were going but then the other day my in box started blowing up.  Another poster was going through a very similar event as to what I went through.  I sent him a p.m. and hope that my experience can help him along.

Anyway when last I posted Jenny & I had started to see each other and Susan & I had agreed to be friends with her holding out hope that some day we will get back together.

Against a lot of people's advice, sorry I just did what I thought was best, I came clean to Jenny about everything.  About Susan about the toll it took on me as a person, how poorly I handled everything and yes I was even honest about the suicidal gesture on my part.

Contrary to what a lot of poster told me, this was the single best thing I have ever done.  This opened up a dialogue between us and she has been another level of support that I never expected to have.  

We spent hours and hours talking about both of our pasts, I know all about her ex's and issues she has had and she knows all about mine.

As to therapy.  I went to the emergency session and then I had two weekly followups after that then we did a session two weeks later and he and I both agreed that I am in a very good place and I am back to him being available for me if I need him.

I am making it a point to use Jenny as support but not to be so invested in her that I become unhealthy about it.  In fact after the first month of talking about things we have kind of moved on to just bringing it up if one of us feels down for some reason and we both are great about getting each other out of that mood.  When she comes into a room I can't be upset anymore.

As to Susan.  

Well one thing I did learn about Jenny is that she is a very open and honest person and when I told her about Susan still being invested in me and waiting on me she told me that she felt sorry for her.

Then she did something that I still can't quite understand but she called up Susan and took her to lunch.  Neither of them will tell me exactly what was said but both of them seem to get along now and when I've seen Susan for lunch Jenny was invited to come along by Susan.  It was an awkward lunch for me but neither of them seemed to bat an eye.

Susan has told me that she thinks Jenny is a wonderful woman and will not do anything to interfere with us but wants me to know that she is still going to wait on me and knows that I am her one true love.

I've told her that knowing this its just not right for me to ever see her without Jenny being there as I would never want Jenny to ever suspect anything.  We've agreed to basically keep in touch via text and only meet up when Jenny can be there.

Overall life is so much better than I thought it would be.  I feel like some guy who has come out of a 5 year coma and found out that life has gone on.

It's been a couple of months and I don't know the rules or anything about this type of stuff but I am ready to commit to telling Jenny I love her.  I've never said those words to another woman before and that is something of a hurdle for me.  I plan on telling her this week.

Now I just have to hope it doesn't scare her away. :)

Thank you relationships you guys have no idea how much you helped me.  In particular that first night when I about sunk into the same black hole I spent the previous few years trying to get out of.

## What is Apex Capital AI?

Apex Capital AI is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze markets and execute trades on behalf of users. Think of it like a robo-trader that doesn’t sleep, doesn’t panic, and doesn’t need coffee every hour to stay focused.

The platform's main appeal is that it simplifies trading for people who might not be pros. It uses algorithms to spot trends and opportunities across different markets—including **crypto, forex, stocks**, and even **commodities**. You can let the AI do most of the work or adjust the settings for more control.

What’s cool is that it tries to eliminate the emotional side of trading. No more panic-selling because you saw a red candle!

## Who Created Apex Capital AI?

This is where things get a little murky.

The creators of Apex Capital AI are **not publicly named**, which is pretty common with platforms like this (see also: Bitcoin Era, Bitcoin Code). The site claims it was developed by a team of experienced traders, AI engineers, and data scientists. That might sound generic, but the platform itself feels professionally built.

While I’d love more transparency about the team behind it, the lack of public info doesn’t automatically make it shady. Still, I always recommend caution and starting small—just like with any investment tool.

## How Does Apex Capital AI Work?

At its core, Apex Capital AI uses **machine learning algorithms** to scan vast amounts of market data in real-time. It looks for patterns, price movements, and indicators that suggest a good entry or exit point.

Here’s a basic breakdown of how it works:

- **Market Analysis**: The software constantly monitors global financial markets using AI models.
- **Signal Generation**: It identifies potentially profitable trades.
- **Execution**: Depending on your settings, it can automatically execute trades or send alerts for manual approval.
- **Learning**: Over time, the AI adapts based on past performance and new data.

You can choose between **auto-trading** and **manual trading**, which gives flexibility depending on how hands-on you want to be.

## Apex Capital AI Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s the good and the not-so-good.

### Pros:
- **Beginner-friendly** – Super easy to use, even if you’ve never traded before.
- **AI automation** – Takes the guesswork out of trading.
- **Supports multiple assets** – Not just crypto, but also forex, stocks, and commodities.
- **Demo account available** – Try before you risk real money.
- **No commissions** – You keep what you earn (aside from potential spreads).

### Cons:
- **No mobile app** – Works fine on a browser, but an app would be nice.
- **Opaque founders** – Would love more transparency about who’s behind it.
- **Requires $250 to start** – Not free to try with real money.

- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android)

It doesn’t have a dedicated mobile app, which is a bit of a bummer. But the web platform is mobile-optimized and works smoothly on smaller screens.

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The AI continuously monitors global markets, from major cryptocurrencies to traditional stocks. This allows the platform to react instantly to changing conditions—something a human trader couldn’t possibly do manually 24/7.

### User-Friendly Interface

Honestly, this is one of the cleanest trading UIs I’ve used. The dashboard is intuitive, with charts, balances, and trade settings all laid out clearly. If you’ve ever been overwhelmed by other platforms (*cough* MetaTrader), you’ll appreciate this one.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a native app, the mobile site works surprisingly well. You can check your trades, adjust settings, or even fund your account straight from your phone. I’ve used it on both iPhone and Android—no major issues.

### Customizable Alerts

If you’re not into the full auto-trading experience, you can set up **custom alerts**. This way, you get notified of trade opportunities, but you still make the final call.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Apex Capital AI isn’t limited to just crypto. You can trade:

- Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins
- Forex pairs like EUR/USD
- Stocks like Apple and Tesla
- Commodities like gold and oil

That gives you more diversification than most AI trading tools.

## Is Apex Capital AI a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn’t seem like it**.

Based on my testing, user feedback, and comparison with similar platforms, Apex Capital AI looks like a legit tool. It’s not some get-rich-quick scheme, and it doesn’t promise you’ll become a millionaire overnight.

That said, always keep your guard up. Start with the **demo mode**, don’t deposit more than you can afford to lose, and watch out for any third-party brokers or fake clones of the site.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Apex Capital AI?

To start live trading, you’ll need to deposit **$250**.

This is pretty standard for platforms in this space. That deposit is your trading capital—not a fee. You can use it to open positions across various markets.

### Apex Capital AI Customer Support

Their support is actually decent. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** – Available most hours
- **Email** – Responses within 24 hours in my experience

No phone support, but the live chat gets the job done for most questions.

## How do you start trading on Apex Capital AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Apex Capital AI site and fill out the signup form. It takes maybe a minute. You’ll just need basic info: name, email, and phone number.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be prompted to verify your identity (usually a government ID and proof of address). After that, deposit at least $250 to start live trading.

Payment methods include:

- Credit/debit cards
- Bank transfer
- Sometimes crypto (depends on broker)

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either activate **auto-trading** and let the AI handle everything, or switch to **manual mode** for more control. I recommend trying the **demo account** first to get a feel for how things work.

## How to Delete an Apex Capital AI Account?

To delete your account:

1. Reach out to their customer support via email or live chat.
2. Request account closure and data deletion.
3. Make sure you withdraw any remaining funds before doing this.

They don’t make it hard, which is nice. No shady “are you sure?” loops.

1k0bb3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1k0bb3q/my_plan_that_worked/,MY PLAN THAT WORKED,"People often ask me how I got rid of SIBO and H. pylori so I went into my doctors treatment app to find my documents so I can post it for everyone finally. Please keep in mind that your treatment will look different than mine in CERTAIN ways but the idea will still be the same. Yours will be based on the kind of SIBO you have, the intensity of the infection, and your own mineral deficiencies. The point is to treat the infection, as well as replenish, while not making things worse (with lifestyle, diet, and alcohol).

After I got a G.I. map test and blood test done, and we learned that I had h pylori, SIBO, as well as a mild gluten and dairy intolerance (likely due to the bacterial infections). I had SIBO first then got h.pylori because I left it untreated for so long. 

The plan was to eradicate the bacterial infections while supporting adrenal function, thyroid, while staying away from foods that feed the bacteria such as gluten and dairy, and replenishing those nutrients and vitamins lost. 

THIS IS LONG but please read until the end (please the important takeaways - especially the last one)

Month 1:


UPON WAKING (7 am )

Motility Matrix - 1 cap (SIBO was slowing my gut motility greatly)


BREAKAST

1.HCL (supporting stomach acid production and reducing bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine)

2. Vitamin D - 5 drops (under togue) (to treat deficiency as SIBO inhibits vitamin and nutrient absorption greatly)

3. Thyroid Matrix - 2 caps (thyroid support)

4. Intensity SAP - 1/2 cap for 1 week; 1 cap ongoing (replenishes microbiome)

5. Motility Matrix - 1 cap 

LUNCH

1. HCL

2. Zinc - 50 mg (to treat deficiency as SIBO inhibits vitamin and nutrient absorption greatly)

3. Omega 3 (liquid - supportive for reducing inflammation)


Mid-afternoon *1-2 hrs away from food/supplements/coffee 

1.Glutashield - 1 scoop in 1 cup water. (soothes and repairs intestinal lining)

2. Motility Matrix - 1 cap 

DINNER

1. HCL


BEDTIME 

1.Magnesium Glycinate Chelate- 2-4 caps (also helps with bowel movements greatly)



For month 1 and 2 we added other vitamins I was deficient in because I could afford to at that point, we also switched out HCL for Berberine one month, and a SIBO tincture the next (the tincture was fucking heinous and potent but it was an absolute SIBO killer). I think the tincture was Barberry, Thyme, and Myrrth - extremely concentrated.

The following 2 months (so month 4 and 5) we kept up with adrenal and bowel movement support as well as the vitamins. I was instructed to stay off gluten and dairy and then slowly reintegrate it if my body could handle it, but it couldn't. Honestly I never could and just didn't realize that I was feeling like shit because of it.

Important takeaways: 

1. Again - your treatment will look different than mine based on the kind of SIBO, the intensity of the infection, and your own mineral deficiencies. The point is to treat as well as replenish, while not making things worse with diet and alcohol. Yes I’m sorry, stay away from alcohol.

2. Gluten and dairy will always and forever be adding fuel to the fire with any bacterial infection. If anyone here tells you different they siiiimply just do not know what they are talking about and giving bad advice, while also worsening their condition (while living in denial) CRY ABOUT IT.. Do you want SIBO or H.pylori forever????? Thought not.

3. The presence of SIBO creates a domino effect on your entire system. Skin conditions can show up, hair can fall out, exreme bloating and weight gain. and constipation etc. It's highly likely that you'll end up getting H.Pylori as a result, one can cause the other when left untreated.

4. Remembering that gut bacterial get infections deplete your vitamin and nutrient levels overtime, and getting back to a normal level takes a lot of time and consistency if you're taking supplements as opposed to infusions (which I highly recommend instead of). This aspect of treatment alone can make it very expensive. 

5. Supporting your system while also working to eradicate is VERY important, your body is not strong enough to work at the capacity it needs to, treat it with love. MAKE SURE you're pooping, get those toxins the f out of you. If you're not pooping, not only is the bacteria is staying in your system and making things worse, but your estrogen is heightening and can cause hair loss, PCOS, reproductive issues, breasts in men etc. Extreme inflammation all over your body, pls just ensure you're pooping.

6. If you're not pooping, I know you probably want to add fibre to your diet because that's what normal-bodied people can do to effectively help you, but fibre can be a total BOMB for bacteria, they thrive off that shit so consider that in your treatment.

7. If you choose not to go the herbal route, and opt for typical antibiotics with an MD - remember that you're wiping out allllll of your good bacteria too, and you'll NEEEEED to be taking probiotics at the same time so you're not giving your body more of an opportunity to let bad bacteria and lack of good fuck you up even more. You NEED good bacteria period period period. If your MD tells you otherwise, or urges you to wait until you're done your antibiotics to start taking probiotics, please seek a second opinion. It's common knowledge that MD's do not take the time to give treatment plans that are comprehensive to overall health and do not look at things like this holistically. Anyone here who has come to an MD about this and been told it's just IBS, and to eat low fodmap will roll their eyes as they reflect now, and agree.

8. Speaking of probiotics, it’s important you are taking the strains that your body specifically needs, do not just take any, get some guidance as to not make it worse. (Always find gluten and dairy free options)

9. Last but not least (and most important) - if all you do with a naturopath, if it’s the only thing you can afford, ORDER A GI MAP TEST AND BLOOD TEST. This will give you an extremely comprehensive understanding of 
e v e r y t h i n g going on inside of you. This is how you know exactly what to do, and not end up wasting time and a shit ton of money (and the will to live). Could someone teach a class on calculus if they did not educate themselves beforehand? Could a surgeon work on a body before going to med school? No. Educate yourself on your body THEN take action.

1k0b9cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/1k0b9cl/parents/,parents,"anyone else have very toxic weird parents? i just feel this must be normal i mean i see it time to time online like tiktok comments and such. 

like im 22 i feel like im a full grown women and still my parents are so invasive. they’ve been my whole life but i just assumed it’d be over by now. and i don’t even go out and i rarely have friends cause them so it’s not like im disobedient and go out and stuff. mostly school and work (currently unemployed so im home most of the time but when i do) i always come home before maghreb. my parents get upset when i go somewhere with my friends after, they always assume the worst of me. 

like i like going to the beach and some days when im free after class ill go there, literally look at the water for a bit, i collect rocks as well and so i usually pick some things up. i get a drink like a coffee nearby and come home. and these usually happens early like tuesdays or thursday’s when i finish 10:30am from class. my mom then told me the area i go to is full of muslim men and a specific ethnicity and she thinks its wrong for me to be there and around them. which i asked her why would i be around them and that i dont even see the people she’s talking about. she’s shouting at me on the phone saying she wont have a daughter in the street. mind you they have my location and my dad checks it allllll day because he barely works and is so obsessed with controlling me. 

my dad gets me upset because he goes through my things, he checks my banks (everytime i open a new bank he takes it from me so don’t even say make a new one because this is ongoing third on he took and idk how he even finds out about it) if im on the toliet he knocks. if im in my room he bursts in. he checks my call logs and tells me he does then when i say why he says cause its my house u live in and my phone i gave u. 

i just dont understand what this is about and i can assure you im a respectable young women. i mean i pray all my prayers, im giving, i clean, i cook, i play with my siblings. it’s like my mom has this secret hate towards me. 


i could talk about the ways they physically and mentally abused me for so long but the whole reason for this post is what happened today, i’ve been telling my mom for a week now ill be going to a school event that’s taking place in the evening. we were checking in with each other the whole day. i at first, told her i wanted to come home and sleep for a bit since i was up since fajr but then told her that ill stay until the evening on campus since i have major exams approaching and ill just go to the study sessions they are having. i told her this, wallah. and she told me okay. i told her ill call my dad after for a ride and she says oh yes call him when ur done and see if he is near to come. okay right khalas it’s the end of this event i told her about, this is a educational event by the way its not like a school party or anything. this is a benefit to me. the end of the event comes and the speakers were taking so long and i originally believed i could catch the last bus but by the time it was over i had not enough time to get to the bus stop. it’s late at this point im talking almost 11pm…. never been out this late besides taraweeh


i call my dad, coincidentally my moms on the line with him so it’s a three way.  he tells me i would have but im not close i say okay. he then asks where i am, number one he just has bad memory and i told him once but not today so it made sense to me. i told him school for a event. he then said at 6pm i was off campus, he said the specific street and i didn’t recognize it and i was flustered cause its dark and i have anxiety and im about to miss the bus and im also with my friend. i was like i got food baba. he’s like “at 6pm you get food and now your telling me your at school again” i then say out of frustration “what are all these questions baba, why are u asking me about food at 6pm when i asked for help for right now” the worst part was my moms on the phone saying “where did she go? campus is closed at this time where is she?” she’s not even addressing me right, she does this all the time. tries to impress my dad like he’s her boyfriend or something. i was flabbergasted guys i was so let down, im like it’s late im in a city the bus im missing it and i can also take a uber but instead im being played with on the phone like im a kid. my dad is mocking me and then saying that im weird and basically laughing manically acting like im lying or something. my mom doesn’t even once say that she knew i was at school or that i was at the event i told her. my dad tells me to take a uber i say okay and i end the phone so i can deal with my own stuff. 

i find a ride, i was gonna call my sister but i called my mom on her cell. she already answers angrily like “what” when i call. i start casual im like omg im so tired my ride is almost here she’s barely speaking she’s like just making noises like she agrees. then i ask her “mama why’d you pretend you didn’t know where i was when i told you long ago” she starts yelling saying listen to me how dare u ask us why we are asking u so many questions this is my house … etc.  wallahi i tell her sorry for saying that and i was just missing the bus and confused. my mom , if you say sorry to her she will make a even bigger commotion and loves drama and if you say sorry she sees it as your admitting she’s right. so she’s like no no no your weird like your sisters are not like you how could u say that. i tell her that i said i went to get food and that’s not the point the point was how can she act like she had no idea where i was and then also make the comment that campus was closed at the time i called. like guys she acted as if she thought i was home the whole time. like am i crazy or …

anyways she’s yelling at me and im trying to get her to listen all she keeps repeating is i disrespected my dad and come home now. i end the phone i burst out crying and im just sobbing waiting for my uber even a police officer drives to me and comes out and asks me if im okay. i told him i was fine. 

i’m so sick of this ladies, my mom and dad are childish. they constantly do stuff to me and i forgave them for all the physical abuse they put me through. the mental abuse. you guys don’t understand i even got a auto immune disease from the problems i was dealing with at home. this is so serious. and i forgave them for the sake of Allah guys, i still help them around like im still in undergrad because i took a almost two year break because i was suicidal yall and depressed for awhile because of them. i mean they only stopped hitting me at 20 years old and i remember when i finally asked my dad seriously and with a regular tone “why do you have to hit me everytime i speak to you why can’t you use your words” my mom literally had to hold him back from me, he was telling me if im so big and bad to hit him now and he dares me. and why don’t i challenge him and hit him if i have so much to say. my mom was just saying i was disrespectful and how can i say that to my parents. i had so much anger in my eyes that day he said “look how angry she is at me, i dont even wanna sleep in the same house as her tonight i feel like she will kill me” like thats ridiculous. i was just feeling so degraded. i was just so tired. no one helped me. even when i bring up today to my mom that i got sick cause of stress she tells me how about her? she says how about her she was stressed too. and i told her i was literally a underage child and she tells me okay well i was pregnant. like there’s no sympathy for me. 

and guys my whole life i thought i was just some evil kid and that’s why they did this to me. but now that im 22 i know im not. i know im strong. i know Allah will reward me for my
pain. i’m a great person. i treat bugs, animals and kids and people and even plants with respect. i have no hate in my heart. i love everyone. i still make dua for my family and my parents for Allah to forgive them and give them Jannah. my mom doesn’t even pray and she tries to religiously guilt me all the time. my dad texts prostitutes yet he’s in prayer all night. all of this confuses me. i know im a good person. i know ill be a good mom and good wife someday. i dont care what they think anymore. i spent so long trying to get comfort from them and was always met with coldness. i always thought dads were supposed to protect their daughters but i feel so unsafe around him and other men. i can say the pain hurts, it does but i just want to be happy. i crave a good environment so bad i cant give up. and i love Allah and i love islam man. those will be the reason for my peace. i know ill be okay. i dont want sympathy. i want logical advice and also similar stories of people who agree. i don’t wanna hear for me to forgive them and have patience because ive done both and will always continue to do both because i want Allah to do the same to me. i love life, and i hope that when i die someday people know how much i cared about everything, people and this world. i hope people know how much i love. how much love i have and how much i wanted to be loved and understood. i wish they accepted me for who i am. i wish they loved me unconditionally. i wish i was not the least favorite and i wish i had gotten the support when i needed it. because i don’t anymore.

1k0b8q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1k0b8q2/damaged_need_to_rant_in_need_of_support/,"Damaged, need to rant. In need of support.","Recently broke up with pwbpd of about 3.5 years. Still living together until she can find a new place. Part of me had wanted to end it for a long time, but as per usually I remember her good side and how “maybe things will get better”.

She was very loyal throughout most of the relationship, but for a few months before the breakup I had this intense gut feeling that there was some kind of cheating happening, even if it was just getting emotionally involved with another man. She was incredibly distant, physically and emotionally. Every time I brought it up it was always my fault, whether I wasn’t emotionally available enough, not confident enough, not assertive enough, not clean enough, there was always something. 

The man in question is a guy I was in school with for around 6 months, we got along well. When my partner inevitably needed a new job, I reached out and he helped her get into a good position. I was concerned from the start but I decided to trust her and put my issues with jealousy aside. 
She stated that he got her the job and refused to give me any credit for reaching out for her.
Then she gets his number, they start texting.
At first I still wasn’t too concerned as she had quite a few of her coworkers numbers and talked to a lot of them.
Then she’s texting him our seating positions while we’re at a show. And I’m getting the vibe that she would rather be hanging out with him than me. 
When I brought it up, she got upset. Hard to remember how the conversation went exactly but my feelings were wrong, and I should have just not worried about it.
Multiple other times I brought up my suspicions that she was hiding something from me, and that I was concerned about her relationship with this guy. Pretty much every time it ended up with her getting very upset that I didn’t trust her, and leaving it at that. She would say things like” yeah he’s cute, but I wouldn’t abandon our relationship for him”.
Maybe 2 weeks later she breaks it off, stating that if we got married things would be different. Along with lots of other reasons that ended up making me feel more confused than anything.
It was a good mix of relief, optimism for my future and deep sadness of losing her, all felt relatively normal given the circumstances.
A few nights later she goes out with her coworkers, this guy included. (Keep in mind we still live together in a 1 bed apartment ).Turns off her location sharing and just goes radio silent for the whole night. I maybe got 3 hours of light shitty sleep that night. This is where the heavy mental spiralling and even deeper pain started. The next morning I find the text of her letting me know she might be spending the night with a bunch of the coworkers.

When she gets back home I talk to her about it. She tells me that she was sleeping on a couch and “someone” brought her a blanket while she was talking about how the emotional pain of the breakup was hitting her. Silly me asked who the someone was and it was “the guy” in question.

My heart literally sank, the very physical feeling of a weight being thrusted down your chest. The cuts were getting deeper. 

Maybe that night or the night after, can’t quite remember anymore, she went downstairs to do some laundry and left her phone on the couch. I couldn’t resist. I quickly grabbed it and checked all of the messages between them. I felt I had no more control of my mind or body, I was fully aware of the double edged sword this would be and went for it. 

Nothing too crazy, and I keep thinking that maybe I’m just crazy. But they were texting quite a bit.
Lots of small talk, he invited her out that night and she gave him a ride. 

My heart was pounding, I was shaking and I didn’t know what else to do other than leave and aggressively and manically walk. Fortunately I have a good friend that I called and was able to talk it out a little.

Almost every second of every day I’m now a mental mess, thinking about him and her, how his type is anything with a heartbeat and how she admitted that she’s attracted to him. I can’t get it out of my head and the pain continues to linger and dig. All the while she is still living here.

She would have intense fits over crumbs on a counter, spend more effort getting her coworkers goodie bags for Christmas than my own present, tell me she didn’t want me come to her Christmas party because she “didn’t want to babysit me”, then wonder why I don’t have as much confidence as I used to. All the while I feel like an idiot for continuing to hope that she/ we would get better. I put so much effort into making her feel comfortable when she was sick or on her period, only for her to get annoyed when I wasn’t feeling well. Coming home and ranting about work or life for 2 hours straight, yet hardly ever asking me how my day was. Every morning I would bring her a cup of coffee in bed, and yet it was never enough. 

I don’t even know for sure if she is abandoning me for another man, but it very much feels like it and it hurts like crazy. 
Every time she’s not home on time, out late or if I don’t know where she is, I can’t get it out of my head and it just stings. Meanwhile I’m just sitting at home with my thoughts. 

Best case scenario is she moves out in 2 weeks, and even that feels like far too long. 
Im constantly going back and forth from wanting to confront her about how I feel, to just keeping my mouth shut around her so things are civil while she finds another place to live.

I’m fucked up big time, but reading some of the experiences of other on this sub has provided me some much needed relief. I am desperate for some mental clarity and to get out of this deep depressing hole that I am stuck in. I feel like a fool for staying as long as I did.

1k0b7tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1k0b7tm/is_my_dad_being_financially_abused_by_his_brother/,Is my dad being financially abused by his brother and sister in law?,"I’m the only child (27, F) to my dad and mum has remarried. I have a close relationship him and visit him often. He recently retired in January.

Yesterday, I was at his place helping him with his phone as he’s not tech-savvy. We were sitting together having a coffee while I was waiting for a code via text message on his phone to access his account when I saw a message to my aunty (my dad's brother's wife) that said, “let me know when you get the $850.” I instantly asked my dad about it. He got defensive and said the money was for their car insurance. 

Backstory: my dad’s brother and his wife don’t work and live off Centrelink (payments from the government for unemployed in Australia) They have a daughter who is in and out of prison and has been caught with weapons. My dad has given them money for most of his life because he feels sorry for younger brother, but he can’t really afford it since he’s on the pension. He often tells me he’s stressed about money and can’t sleep well. At 68, with many health issues, he continues to support them, even though they know he can’t afford it. A lot of the money goes towards my dad’s brothers drug habits. My dad says my uncle uses drugs for pain, but I know he does meth and drives while high - putting other people on the road in danger. My dad also helped buy them both of their cars. Which I never knew until years later.

Anyway, I had enough yesterday. I instantly called my aunty, whom I stopped speaking to years ago because of this situation, and firmly said, “Hello… you both need to stop asking dad for money. He’s on the pension and can’t afford it. He will run out of money and won’t be able to afford his mortgage.” She claimed she never asked for money and accused me of abusing her before hanging up. She then called my dad and told him I abused her and accused her of lying.. my dad didn’t defend me and told my aunty not to be upset and she could keep the money. My aunty then hung up on my dad. 

My dad then got angry at me for starting drama. I am so upset that he never defends me and always sides with his brother and sister-in-law, who don’t even contact him on his birthday. They don’t care about him, yet he continues to give them thousands, even taking money out of his home loan, which he can’t afford. Whenever I ask my dad why he does it, he says his brother has had a hard life. My dad also continues to say everytime he sends them money is the last time. But it continues. I told my dad I was too upset to stay and left his place, I told him I felt betrayed that he never understands where I am coming from. 

Am I in the wrong in this situation? I honestly feel like this could be financial abuse, even though my dad willingly sends money every time. I should also add at Christmas time he has given them $500 each. They also ask my dad’s other siblings for money from time to time.. but they often say no.


Basic summary TDLR - my aunty and auntie keep asking for money off my dad. My dad is retired and doesn’t have much money. He is old and has health issues. ",2,1744775105.0,family,1,1.0,False

It's been a while since my second script. But after a few months of tossing out ideas, I finally have a third one ready to go! I had hoped to upload it before my birthday, but one thing led to another, and it's being uploaded on my birthday instead. Such is life :/

  
After experimenting with formatting during my first  two scripts, I tried something a bit different this time. Hopefully it's still clear! I also wanna give a huge shout out to my friends u/lillian_luvcharm u/GooseASMR and u/FROGGIIPRINCE for taking the time to help with beta reading! 

  
Monetization is fine, if you do put the script behind a paywall, I would appreciate a link! Minor edits, ad libs, and gendering the script are also fine! I've included links to a google docs version, a scriptbin version, and a direct post on Reddit. Hopefully, it's helpful!  If you do fill the script, please let me know in the comments! Anyway, I hope the script brings some joy, and have a pleasant timezone!

\[There is a constant rainfall in this script, as the speaker and listener are talking in the rain\]



(the speaker is crying, quietly mumbling to themselves)



Stupid…Hiding that camera in a flower pot, what on Earth was I thinking? Of course, they were going to find it! My sweetie is the smartest person I know. Why did I ever think I could keep it hidden?



\[footsteps approach, the rain should sound slightly distorted, as if bouncing off an umbrella\]



(the speaker gasps, composing themselves)



 Sweetheart? You came- I mean, what are you doing here?



I’m…fine. I don’t need you or your umbrella. I’m completely fine sitting in the rain-



(sneeze)



Okay, maybe I am a little chilly. But I swear I’m fine, you didn’t need to come out and check on me. You can go back home now, we probably shouldn’t talk anyway. Not after our fight-



\[a backpack quietly unzips, the listener pulling items from the bag\]



A blanket and some snacks? You really came prepared to stay, didn’t you? Fine, you can sit down if you want; the bench is big enough for both of us. But I understand if you want to keep some distance between us-



Are you sure you want to be this close to me? Someone “crazy” I believe, were the words you choose back at your house, sweetheart-



(the speaker grows aggressive, as if resuming an earlier argument)



Oh, well, I’m sorry for being concerned about your well being. But when Casey started talking to you after work, what was I supposed to think? That they were really concerned about the project you two have due for your boss? 



Oh sure, that’s all they talk about, but pleasant words can hide malicious thoughts and intentions. Thoughts about how wonderful you are, or how they intend to steal you away from me-



Well no, I don’t know that’s what Casey is thinking. But, by that metric, you can’t know either, can you?



I don’t see how my actions were unreasonable! I never bothered you when I followed you home, I made sure to only check your messages when you weren’t using your phone, and what’s wrong with grabbing your arm when we’re out in public?



I said I was sorry about the camera! But after I caught you out drinking with your coworkers when you told me you were visiting your mothers house, I had to make sure you wouldn’t lie to me again! Thank god she told me the truth when I went to see her, otherwise I would’ve-



(the speaker gets cut off, trying to retort before they collapse and break down) 



I would’ve - I would’ve - I WOULD’VE MADE HER SUFFER FOR TRYING TO HIDE YOU FROM ME! Is that what you wanted to hear!? That I’m having thoughts of violence when it comes to holding on to you?! That I’m so scared of losing you, I keep having these intrusive thoughts about what I would do if someone got between us?



(as the speaker begins to air out their issues, the speaker's voice should be a remorseful sob)



Those thoughts have been ringing in my head for the past three months. I don’t know when it started- maybe when that server wrote your name with a heart at the coffee shop? Who does that anyway-just flirting with you while I’m with you? It was just-



A-anyway. I’ve been dealing with this feeling swallowing me whole for the past 3 months. Anytime you weren’t in my sight, or talking to me over the phone, or texting me-my mind was spiraling with worry, uncertain if you were okay, or if you were talking to someone who wanted to steal you away from me. Or worse, you were thinking about leaving me-



I know-I didn’t have any proof you were thinking of leaving me, and things still seemed normal when we were together. Your smiles were as sincere as ever, your kisses as warm and full of life, and you still held on to our hugs for longer than you needed to… There was no reason for me to suspect anything was wrong, and yet, and yet-



I couldn’t help what I was feeling! That gnawing in the pit of my stomach, the dark feeling swallowing my heart, the intrusive thoughts in my head, “Sweetie isn’t talking to you. They’re talking about their friends and coworkers instead. They are better than you, you don’t matter, \[speaker name\]. You aren’t enough for them anymore.”



I knew what I was feeling wasn’t healthy. This kind of intense jealousy over everyday interactions, looking at you and your coworker handling overtime and suspecting they were trying to take you away. Even worse, wanting to do something about it…



No, I didn’t do anything to them - thank God. But, I thought about it, every day and night. Laying in bed alone, looking out the window, thinking about what I would do if I saw anyone make a move on you, or try to keep us apart. Those thoughts… terrified me. 



I’m supposed to be a good person, right? That’s one of the things you say you love about me, how sweet and caring I am. I cover for my sick coworkers, I pay my half on dinner dates, and I try to greet everyone I can with a smile. I’ve tried to be a good person all my life, and yet these thoughts have come to me so easily…



You want to work through this with me - why? After everything I’ve confessed too, and the spy camera - you want to talk me through this-



(the speaker takes a shaky breath, no longer angry or frantic, but the voice should be shaky) 



Okay, I won’t question it anymore. I’ll try my best to answer any questions you have… I know it’s a lot to ask, but would it be okay if I hold your hand while we talk? 



Thank you, sweetheart. I know I don’t deserve it, but thank you….



I don’t blame you for calling me crazy during our fight, I know I was out of line, and you said it in the heat of the moment. But thank you for apologizing. Now, I’ll answer any questions you have for me, I promise. 



(From here, the pauses between each line should be slightly longer, to denote the listener asking questions. With the first question being “how long was the Camera in the house for?”)



The camera was a new addition I brought just last week. I bought it after you lied to go socialize without me. I felt awful when I installed it in your living room, but I steeled my resolve, because I had to know if you were seeing anyone else. I was relieved to see that wasn’t the case, you didn’t even make a move on Casey when they came over to finish up that assignment. So all the anger I felt at them seemed to be unjustified. 



(The next question “You mentioned having violent thoughts, what stopped you from acting on them?”) 



I didn’t take any action against Casey because I had no evidence they were doing anything. Yes, I was jealous, and I thought you were spending a lot of time with them, but I didn’t have enough proof to say they were trying to steal you away. As jealous as I was, I didn’t want to hurt them, not unless I had to, and even then… 



Mhm, that earlier visit with your mother was the same. As soon as I had the thought of hurting her if she lied, I shook it out of my head as forcefully as I could. I couldn’t do that to her, not after everything she’s done for you, for us, and for me…



But even if I could swallow it down, I still felt angry at you for lying to me, sweetie. Thinking back on how much I was smothering you to validate my insecurities, I can’t blame you for trying to get some space. But in the moment, all I could focus on was the dark feeling in my heart bubbling over.

  
  


I think the reason I got so aggressive with everyone at the bar was because it made me like I was in the wrong for being upset. My sweetie was lying to me, and all of our friends were a part of it. . I still shouldn’t have shouted at them, or accused them of trying to break us up… Are they still mad at me? 



Given I shouted at them for hiding you before you pulled me away for the night, I don’t blame them… I know Avery reached out to ask what was bothering me, but I never answered them, out of embarrassment.They didn’t deserve my verbal abuse, none of you did. I’m truly, truly sorry. 



Worried? After I yelled at them and had to be dragged away, they’re still worried about me? I guess I can understand that, if they think I might turn into a psycho that tries to hunt them down. Like one of those Yandere stories Noah likes so much. 



Oh, you mean worried as in - I see, I guess our friends are a lot kinder than I had thought. I’ll be sure to apologize in person to everyone, next time I see them. Thank you for letting me know, sweetie. What’s your next question? 



(After the next question “Have you ever thought of harming me?” , the speaker is serious and firm.) 



No, absolutely not. Even when you lied about going out with everyone, I never once thought about hurting you. My mind may have spiraled towards harming the people around you for getting between us, but I could never hurt you, sweetie. I love you, from the tips of my toes, to the top of my messed up head. I’d jump off a cliff before I ever harmed you. I couldn’t even act on those violent thoughts, but I never once thought of harming you.



\[a gentle kiss on the cheek is followed by a long pause\]



(the speaker is flustered, but the tone is wistful and remorseful)



When we first met, do you remember how much I hated myself? I was barely eating, sleeping, trying to impress parents who never cared, and dealing with a job which made me bitter, angry, and terrified of everyone around me. You were a true friend in those days. Getting me to enjoy my hobbies again, helping me quit my shitty job for something better, and taking me out everyday to make sure I was eating properly. 



You were like a ray of sunshine, in my dark and gloomy world. You even introduced me to your family and friends, who all accepted me as one of their own. But through it all, with that shining smile of yours, you were the one who made my heart race everyday. 



I still don’t understand why you accepted my confession. My words were so slurred with anxiety, I can’t even remember what I actually said. But, you still took my hand, and called me your darling. And the past 10 months have been the best of my life, right up until I ruined it today.



…It’s ruined because you're breaking up with me, isn’t it obvious? You're going to break up with me because I crossed a line, violated your boundaries, and I’m a danger to those around you. I don’t deserve to be with you, and breaking up with me is for the best-



You're not breaking up with me? Sweetheart, it’s only a matter of time before I do something to hurt you, or the people in your life! These urges, even if I know how unhealthy they are-I’m still feeling them, I can’t stop them on my own. As long as we’re together, that’s going to be a risk, fixing it could take years of therapy and-



\[The speaker is cut off by a kiss from the listener\]



… Alright, I’m shutting up and listening now.



(the speaker is surprised by the listeners words, but they hesitate.) 



Couples therapy for jealousy? Are you sure you want to commit to that? Therapy can take a long time for results to show, and one of us might get impatient and give up if I don’t get better fast enough-



\[The speaker is cut off by another kiss\]



Y-Yes I do love you, sweetheart. I would think my intense jealousy makes that obvious.



(the speaker gasps quietly, now tripping over their words)



Sweetheart, you can’t just drop that sort of confession on me when I’m already flustered! You can’t just say ‘I love you’ after I tried to stalk you!



Because it doesn’t make any sense! It’s completely illogical for you to feel that way after a violation of trust like that! You have no obligation to stay and support me! I’ve been harboring violent thoughts towards others, and invading your privacy! How can you still love me after all of that?



Yes, I know love doesn’t always follow common sense, but there have to be limits-



\[The speaker is cut off by another kiss from the listener, leaving them annoyed, but happy\]



You really can’t keep cutting me off like that, you know… How am I supposed to hold myself back when you keep kissing me like we’re in some cliche romance film? You're making it hard for me to stay away from you, sweetheart…



I suppose, every relationship has it’s own unique challenges. Honestly, you're unbelievable, sweetie. Bringing light into my life from the day we met, and now standing by me after I tried to stalk you. What did I ever do to deserve someone as bright as you in my life?



(The speaker laughs as the listener lists all of the things they love about the speaker)



Now I know you're trying to flatter me. I’d like to argue with you, but the rain isn’t letting up, and I don’t want you to catch a cold-ACHOO!



(the speaker sneezes, sniffling and chuckling)



See? I really don’t want to pass anything on to you, so please stop holding on so tight, sweetheart.



(The speaker laughs, amused) 



And here I thought I was supposed to be the clingy one. Very well, I can tell you're serious from the look in your eye… Let’s head back -  my place or yours?



Alright…back to your house for some cuddling and chicken soup. Thank you, for your forgiveness and patience, sweetheart…I love you. And I promise, I’ll do everything I can to get through this, with you.

## What is Immediate Future AI?

**Immediate Future AI is an automated trading platform** built to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets using AI-powered tools. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends, then automatically places trades based on that data. You don’t need to sit and watch the charts all day—it’s kind of like having a robot do the thinking for you.

One thing that stands out is how it’s designed for people who don’t have a background in finance. The platform claims to provide consistent signals and a user-friendly interface, making it easy to get started even if you’ve never traded before.

## Who Created Immediate Future AI?

There’s no single person or big-name company publicly attached to the creation of Immediate Future AI, which is pretty common with these types of platforms. It was likely developed by a group of software engineers and financial experts, similar to how **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge** came onto the scene.

While the anonymity might seem sketchy at first, it’s not that unusual in the crypto space. What’s more important is how the platform performs and whether it actually delivers on its promises—and we’ll get into that.

- The platform uses **AI algorithms** to scan the market 24/7.
- It looks for patterns, news events, price movements—anything that might indicate a good time to buy or sell.
- Once a signal is detected, it can either **suggest a trade** or **automatically execute** it based on your preferences.

You can customize how much control you want. Some users prefer the hands-off, fully automated mode, while others like to get alerts and manually confirm trades. The real benefit is that it reacts to the market way faster than a human could.

## Immediate Future AI Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I found during my testing:

### Pros:
- **Super easy to use**, even for beginners
- **AI-driven analysis** gives a serious edge for timing trades
- Supports multiple assets (not just Bitcoin)
- Offers a **demo mode** to test strategies risk-free
- Works on desktop and mobile

### Cons:
- The **minimum deposit of $250** might feel high for some
- Doesn’t reveal much about the developers
- **No guaranteed profits** (but that’s just trading in general)

Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons if you’re looking for a simple way to automate your trades.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Immediate Future AI?

Immediate Future AI works on pretty much anything:

- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones**, both Android and iOS

There’s no standalone app on the App Store or Google Play, but the web version is fully responsive. I used it on my phone and it ran smoothly—no lag or weird formatting issues. So you can check your trades while waiting in line for coffee.

## Immediate Future AI – Supported Countries

Immediate Future AI is available in most countries, including:

- **United States**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Canada**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**
- **South Africa**
- **New Zealand**

Some countries may have restrictions due to local crypto regulations. If you’re unsure, try signing up—if your country isn’t supported, the system will let you know early in the process.

## Immediate Future AI – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The AI engine is always watching the market—literally 24/7. It scans thousands of data points in real-time: news, social media, indicators, charts, and more. This helps you catch trends *before* they explode.

### User-Friendly Interface

No confusing dashboards here. Everything’s laid out clearly, with big buttons and simple explanations. Even if you’ve never traded a day in your life, you’ll know what to do.

### Mobile Accessibility

Since it runs in your browser, you can use it on any device. I’ve used it while commuting, on lunch breaks, and even during Netflix binges.

### Customizable Alerts

Don’t want automatic trades? Set up alerts instead. The platform will ping you when a good opportunity pops up. It’s like a crypto assistant tapping your shoulder and saying “Hey... you might want to look at this.”

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not just limited to Bitcoin. The platform also supports:

- Ethereum
- Litecoin
- Ripple (XRP)
- Forex pairs
- Some stocks (depending on broker integration)

It’s nice to diversify without needing 10 different accounts.

## Is Immediate Future AI a Scam?

From what I’ve seen, **Immediate Future AI doesn’t raise any major scam alarms**. It functions similarly to other well-known platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge. It connects to third-party brokers (some regulated), offers a legit demo mode, and doesn’t promise “get rich quick” nonsense.

Still, use common sense: start small, don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose, and always double-check your settings before going fully automated.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Future AI?

You’ll need to deposit at least **$250** to activate your account and start trading. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category.

That money isn’t a fee—it goes into your trading balance. It’s your capital, and you can withdraw it whenever you want.

### Immediate Future AI Customer Support

Support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them through:

- **Live chat** (during business hours)
- **Email support**

I tested it by asking a few questions late at night and got a helpful reply in under 10 minutes. So yeah, they’re responsive.

## How do you start trading on Immediate Future AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site and fill out the short form. You’ll need:

- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number

Takes about 60 seconds.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll be connected with a broker, where you’ll need to complete KYC (identity verification). Then, make your **$250 deposit** via credit card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

From here, you can either:

- Use **demo mode** to test strategies
- Set up **auto-trading**
- Or receive **alerts** and trade manually

You’re in control the entire time.

## How to Delete an Immediate Future AI Account?

If you ever want to leave, just contact support and ask to close your account. They’ll process it within 24–48 hours. Make sure to withdraw your funds first.

1k0b2qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1k0b2qt/bizarre_life_change_after_hot_yoga_class/,Bizarre life change after Hot Yoga class,"Long read but details are important

*Hi! For relevant context, I am 25F currently living in Colorado. I moved here a couple months before the new year. I live a pretty average life other than my work: high-stress life consistently working in different time zones. I don’t exercise much other than hiking & occasional hot yoga. I am highly independent, spiritually active, & self-aware of how I think, feel, & process (I know when something’s off). I eat pretty much everything.
I barely drink, briefly smoked some joints in years past, though I had taken acid about 8 times within a 3-year time span but never a very high dose (max 200ug one time, the rest were 1/2 tabs or about 100 ug). Since the last dose (2y+ since my last bad trip), I have had very fleeting, 10-60sec flashbacks of acid whenever I talk about a trip, looked at a trippy art piece, have had too much coffee, or experience nausea, yet these have never never debilitating to my daily functions. I have depression/anxiety run in my family, though I’ve never been clinically diagnosed*

It all started the evening of December 4th, 2025. I had to wake up extremely early for work shift the next day, so I decided to got to a hot yoga session to help me get to sleep early. I have been to multiple hot yoga sessions before & have only had feelings of bliss/relief afterwards. The yoga session was a blend of vinyasa & Bikram & it was harder than my typical yoga because of the elevation (this was my first time doing it here). It may be important to note that the room was 105 & I did a headstand inversion in the middle of it for a sustained amount of time. 

After my yoga session, during meditation, I felt as if I couldn’t concentrate. Normally, I would have a somatic happy cry, though this time I was really anxious & felt as if I couldn’t get out of my head. When I stood up, everything felt woozy & almost robotic, like a head high. I figured it was from a combination of not eating since lunch or drinking enough water, lack of sleep the previous day, & potentially elevation sickness. I felt extremely hot & it wouldn’t go away even after we walked outside in the cold air. I tried to eat but nothing seemed appetizing, so I forced ice cream down. When driving, things just seemed… off.

Come about an hour later, I enter my room & shit hits the fan. It’s almost like I was reliving a full bad acid trip without the visuals. My inner monologue was racing of catastrophising thoughts. Traumas were coming up & I couldn’t ignore it. I was nauseous, couldn’t physically handle even the idea of eating. I had major tremors. Indigestion set in soon after & I couldn’t keep anything in. I was uncomfortable with different temperatures, foods, lighting, music, & certain topics that were triggering. My jaw was clenched, teeth were chattering, & my head felt SO hot, almost like a brain fever. My temples had a constant, festering pain. Mentally, I felt like I was slipping away & going to be on autopilot. I had to work the next 4 days & couldn’t call out sick. I even dealt with a coworker’s medical emergency & even the rush of that didn’t get me out of my head. I’ve never felt anything like this before. The only thing that made it “better” was interacting with people. I was able to reason & intellectualize my feelings despite the underlying high panic. The days leading on, I noticed It was better in the mornings, though set in intensely at sunset. Sleeping turned into escapism. It all felt like there was SO much energy in my head & didn’t know where to go. Exercising felt.. too good.. uncomfortable, almost like my head chemicals weren’t processing right. It was a living nightmare for 14 days straight. I was so tired by the end of it, & felt frustrated being so on edge.. constantly waking up with the “trip” just to get a full rest & it restarting the next day. I felt isolated in a crowded room. Nothing was working. Nothing physical mattered. 

It was consistently this intense until after New Years. I was feeling good, yet having major anxiety with the thought of coming back home from work because being home felt dooming after being in a bad headspace for so long. I eventually got over that, & realized my room is still a safe space. It was a glimmer of hope that my thought patterns CAN change.

It is now April & I’m still in a constant weird headspace. It varies day to day. I never know how I’m going to wake up & have avoided making big plans, especially anything with big crowds. There are days that get really bad & I panic from the head pain pressure, tunnel vision, feel like im going to pass out, feel numb, &/or hyper emotional. Sometimes the pain moves- from temple to temple, to the forehead, back to the neck almost as if it’s some type of energy that’s stuck. Some days I have no pain at all. Though it has never been as intense as it was the first 2 weeks, I still have light sensitivity, certain music & food turns me off, loud tinnitus, & swells of both what i think to be depersonalization/derealization. I’ve learned to manage it quite well- I hydrate well & my diet has changed to pretty much rice, fish, veggies, fruit, yogurt, & health drinks like kombucha or green smoothies. I eat meat on occasion. There are days I have no appetite all day & others I’m chowing down out of stress. The sun being out longer & weather getting warmer is helping a bit. Recently ive been having a bit of vertigo. 

Despite all of this, I am grateful day to day that I am alive. Today was good enough, for whatever reason, that a lot of things haven’t been bothering me.. so much that I could even type this out, which was a HUGE feat. This too, shall pass.

Any physical, psychological, emotional, & even spiritual explanations/advice are welcome. It is hard for me to look up things as it makes me anxious & spiral out (typical case of the internet giving you worse possible outcomes). I have dabbled with the thought of this being related to having an anxiety disorder to psychedelic PTSD, to CSF leak, to kundalini… Open to literally anything

Thanks in advance

## What is DexanexTrader?

DexanexTrader is an **automated trading platform** that helps users trade in markets like **cryptocurrency, forex, and stocks**—even if they don’t have much experience. It combines trading bots with manual options, so you can either let the algorithms do the work or take control yourself.

The idea behind DexanexTrader is to make trading **accessible, fast, and user-friendly**. It claims to use real-time data and smart algorithms to help users make better decisions and potentially maximize profits. It's especially popular among people who don't have time to sit and watch charts all day but still want to be active in the markets.

## Who Created DexanexTrader?

This is where things get a bit murky. Like many modern trading platforms, DexanexTrader **doesn’t publicly list its developers or leadership team**. That’s not unusual in the fintech space, but it can make some users hesitant.

From what I’ve gathered, the platform seems to have connections to a variety of developers who’ve also worked on platforms like **Immediate Edge** and **Bitcoin Era**, which have similar user interfaces and trading engines. The lack of transparency isn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s something to keep in mind if you like to know exactly who you’re dealing with.

## How Does DexanexTrader Work?

At its core, DexanexTrader uses a combination of **AI-powered bots** and **real-time market analysis** to help users make trading decisions. Once you create an account and deposit funds, the platform lets you:

All of this happens through a **web-based interface** that’s clean and relatively easy to use. It’s designed for beginners but has enough depth for more experienced traders who want to tweak settings or strategies.

The **automation** aspect is probably the biggest selling point. You don’t have to understand candlestick charts or RSI to get started—just set your preferences and let the bot run.

## What is MetaRise AI?

MetaRise AI is an **automated trading software** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and place trades on your behalf. It’s designed for anyone — beginners, part-timers, or even pros who want to automate part of their trading strategy.

Unlike traditional trading platforms, MetaRise AI focuses more on **autonomous decision-making**. That means fewer charts to stare at and more time for, well, literally anything else. The platform can trade crypto, forex, stocks, and even commodities, depending on your preferences.

The idea is to make trading accessible, reduce emotional decision-making, and (hopefully) help users make smarter moves based on data-driven predictions.

## Who Created MetaRise AI?

There isn’t a clear public face behind MetaRise AI, which is pretty common in the auto-trading world. A lot of these platforms are built by **teams of developers, quants, and financial analysts** who prefer to stay behind the scenes. That said, some sources suggest it may share development roots with platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Bitcoin Era**, which have similar interfaces and AI-driven mechanics.

While anonymity can raise eyebrows, it's not necessarily a red flag. A lot of fintech startups operate in stealth mode, especially when they're testing new tech. Still, I always wish these platforms were more transparent about their teams.

## How Does MetaRise AI Work?

MetaRise AI uses **machine learning algorithms** and **real-time data feeds** to analyze market movements. Once it detects a profitable opportunity, it can automatically execute trades on your account.

Here’s an ultra-simplified breakdown:
- It scans crypto and financial markets using AI.
- It identifies patterns based on historical and live data.
- It predicts potential price movements.
- It places buy/sell orders automatically based on your settings.

You can adjust risk tolerance, asset preferences, and trading limits. The platform does the heavy lifting, but you still get to stay in control.

It’s not magic, but it’s definitely smarter than trying to outguess the market manually.

- **No mobile app** – Mobile-friendly site works fine, but a native app would be nice.
- **Market risk still applies** – It’s not a guaranteed money printer.

1k0ayha,https://i.redd.it/3quyu67k94ve1.jpeg,BioLite CampStove 2+ Complete Cook Kit,"Took this out for a test run before heading out. I only used the grill for hot dogs and chili. Real easy to set up. I layed it on a bbq grill and the fold down tripod legs worked perfectly. Instead of foraging for pine cones and twigs, I filled the stove 1/2 full of wood pellets and started it with the provided fire starter. The units battery had enough charge to operate the fan that stokes the fire creating a cyclone type flame that's hot AF!. The led lights monitor the adjustable fan speed that'll adjust the temperature,  and displays the battery charge level. The fan was set at about 75% and it was definitely hot enough.I attached the provided light into the USB but it can be used to charge anything. 
The grill cooked really fast, 4 dogs in about 5 minutes. The chili was put into a small stainless bowl, then onto the grill.
I cooked the dogs 1st then wrapped them on foil and sat on the grill edge while I cooked the chili. In hindsight, I probably could have cooked it all at once instead of 2 phases. Also, I should have added more pellets to start, or added some as some time passed.
It takes a little bit of planning having a multi course meal all hot and cooked at the same time.
The set comes with a vessel that can boil water and be used as a coffee press or to cook soups. The stoves top base can also accommodate a smaller frying pan or 2.0l pot. There's a usb light and cable thats also included. Every item except the grill comes with its own draw string bag. I've put all the pieces into a small tool bag, and the pellets in a plastic ammo box.
I'm looking forward to using this extensively when I'm camping. I've had all types of fuel stoves and they are very efficient, but the reliance and cost of the fossil fuels has turned me off them. If you're a camping single or a couple, this portable unit will amaze you.

## What is Lumen Avkastare?

**Lumen Avkastare** is an automated trading platform that uses AI (artificial intelligence) to help users buy and sell assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks. The idea is to make trading more accessible and less intimidating, especially for people who aren’t seasoned investors.

It’s designed to monitor the market in real-time and execute trades based on pre-set strategies, so users don’t have to sit in front of their screens all day. Kind of like having a personal assistant that trades for you — minus the salary and coffee breaks.

## Who Created Lumen Avkastare?

This is where things get a little vague. Like many algorithmic trading platforms, **Lumen Avkastare** doesn’t have a public-facing founder or team. Some say it's backed by a group of fintech developers and former Wall Street traders who wanted to democratize access to intelligent trading tools.

While that sounds cool, I would’ve appreciated more transparency. Still, this isn’t uncommon in the world of trading bots. Platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** also play it close to the chest when it comes to their creators.

How do I navigate family chaos?,"My brother and I have been estranged for about five years. He’s made it clear that unless I apologize for something I said and/or did during a family event years ago, he wants nothing to do with me. I’ve never been given a clear explanation of what exactly I need to apologize for, and the longer this has gone on, the more frustrating it feels to be pressured to cave and apologize for something i dont understand.

The incident that led to our estrangement happened after he and his wife announced they were expecting their first child. I made what I thought was a harmless, teasing comment—something like ""this is amazing news! You, though? Youre not so great"" with a smile, to me clearly indicating i was just kidding. This is the kind of ribbing he had done to me our entire lives, in successes and failures alike. His response to me was to cut me out and off. Overnight, I was disappeared from their lives, and we haven’t spoken since.

The part that makes this really hard for me is the long history we have. I was the younger sibling by nearly four years, and from early childhood, he made my life hell. There’s a lot I don’t remember from that time—trauma makes the details slippery—but what I do remember is a constant miasma of fear and humiliation. There were two main scenarios that played out after school for me: either my brother intercepted me at the door, or god forbid my mom did.

For example, a memory: I was walking home from the bus stop, headphones in, just a kid trying to enjoy the last moment of peace before getting home. As I opened our front door, my brother—who had been hiding behind it—slammed it shut into my face with full force, smashing my head against the glass storm door. I started falling, holding my mouth because the braces on my teeth were now firmly lodged in the flesh of my lips. Before I could even react, he yanked off my headphones, mocked me for the music I was listening to, called me a poser and a faggot, then put me in a chokehold at his waist and wrestled me to the ground. That was routine. I would usually try to drag myself to my room so he wouldn't see me crying, but he always saw, and it always opened me up to more punishment.

For context, i feel like its important to mention what we grew up in. My mom hated me and favored my brother from as long as i can remember, and over time that morphed into me being the scapegoat for years and years. When my mom would start to feel the heat from my dad about her pillhead ways, she would seek me out just to use me as a human shield against his fury. Here is a good example of what I mean:

I came home from school and for once, I wasn’t grounded. I think i was 12. I’d managed to avoid reacting to her goading that week, and a couple of neighborhood friends wanted to hang out. I was excited, i didnt have a lot of friends. I brought them into the basement, where I kept all my things. After maybe 15 minutes, my mom called me upstairs. The moment I opened the basement door, she was on me—angry, sneering, saying I had no right to bring “those little assholes” into *her* house and to get rid of them, right now or she would. I begged her not to humiliate me, not to do this, but it only made her more furious. Stupid and panicked, I held the door shut with my foot. She turned, wild-eyed, and struck me hard in the throat with the web between her thumb and forefinger. I choked and stumbled. Then she took the opportunity to tackle me over the couch. My head cracked against the coffee table. While I lay there winded and seeing stars, she marched downstairs and told my friends to “get the fuck out.” They walked past me, silent and pitying. I got up and stood there red-faced while she pointed wordlessly at the door. Finally, she retreated to her bedroom, locked the door, and called my dad to tell him how awful I had been to her and how I put my hands on her first. When he got home, he made me apologize to her while she stood there tight-lipped and cold. Then, I had to go out to dinner with them, sat there silently, and at the end of the meal I had to thank my mom for letting me come with. The knot on the back of my head throbbed the whole time.

That’s the kind of house we grew up in. Im sure my brother has similar stories about my dad, but he was the only one that didnt hit me so 🤷‍♀️

We weren't allowed to complain. If I ever spoke up about what my brother did, my dad would tell me, “Siblings bully each other, but of course he loves you. Move on.” If I brought up my mom’s behavior, it was: “She wasn’t herself, she was high. Let it go.”

As adults, things didn’t get better. We came from military and both my brother and i enlisted at 18. He went combat and i went medical. After his deployments, he needed help but didnt get it. As I moved on, followed a career, and built a life for myself, something strange started to happen. I gained medical authority and was being groomed for leadership while he was struggling, and our roles flipped. I became the golden child. Id be lying if i said i didnt think this was at the true heart of our problems. I think the way he sees it - i dethroned him. In my eyes we were finally equals and for some reason he hated me for it.

His behavior got pettier. At a small party with mutual acquaintances, my brother called me a “stupid bitch” in front of my coworkers from a prestigious hospital. At a different event, he threatened to “kick my teeth in” in front of my entire extended family. And then there was Pierogi Fest—a big annual event in our family.

He had already cut me off by this point and my life had moved on. Preparing for Pierogi Fest, I had spent days making dozens of pierogi with my grandmother by hand, something that meant a lot to me. I figured he would be there, and like an idiot assumed that even though my brother and I were at odds, we could both behave at grandma’s house. But he found out I’d be attending and told my dad, “Oh, that’s no problem. I’ll just make her so ungodly uncomfortable that she leaves.”

My dad called me and said, “It’s not a good idea for both of you to go, so…” and just let the sentence hang. I knew what he wanted. So even though I was a large part in making the food, I stayed home. The day of the party, I didn’t hear from anyone. Hours later, my parents called—not to thank me, not to say they missed me, but to again pressure me to be the bigger person and just apologize because “this is so ridiculous.” That his daughters have the right to meet me, but that won’t happen until I apologize.

No one said anything about the food until I asked. There were no leftovers. Glad they enjoyed.

Not too long after that, my brother sent me a text in the middle of the night: “You have a lot of ass kissing to do.” I still haven’t responded. I just don't want to. I'm not angry, I'm exhausted.

The most galling part is that my family still, right this very second, expects me to make this right. They tell me he’s hurt. He says i make everything about me. That I don’t want anything to do with his kids. That I must’ve known the joke would upset him.

Meanwhile, I’ve never once asked him to take accountability for anything. I’ve never demanded an apology. I haven’t listed out his offenses (well, except for here, i guess) or dredged up the past. I decided that it was worth putting behind me just to find out he hates me all over again. All I’ve done is refuse to reconcile on terms that require me to grovel for the privilege of being mistreated again.

So yeah. I’m tired. I feel like I'm being gaslit. I know a joke doesn’t justify five years of silence. I know I’m not crazy for thinking this is about control, not hurt feelings. I just don't know how to see this clearly without the past clouding everything and making me confused.",1,1744773894.0,relationship_advice,14,0.6,False
1k0aueq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1k0aueq/does_this_sound_like_an_mcas_flare_up/,Does this sound like an MCAS flare up?,"So I have been diagnosed with Graves Disease for 3yrs, and since then I have had a slew of other problems pop up (BPPV and bursitis in my hips, plus having vasovagal syncope since I was a baby). Last week I wound up in the ER for an anaphylactic reaction to I have no idea what, since I have never been allergic to anything before, I had the feeling of dread and immediately took a benadryl and after 30min it wasn't stopping so my husband drove me to the ER as i held onto my daughters epi in case I needed it (by this point my whole mouth and throat were numb, but I could breath fine). Then again I had a smaller reaction Friday evening, where literally the only common denominator was alcohol and buttercream frosting, that was able to be somewhat controlled by benadryl. I do have an appointment with an allergist, and a message in to my doc about the list of problems, but I am wondering if this sounds like an MCAS flare up? I know autoimmune problems often go hand in hand, and already having one can increase the risk of developing another one.

1. Excessive drooling, even awake, not realizing I am actually drooling out of the side of my mouth, because by the time I notice it is usually also about the time I realize my lips are half numb
2. Constant headaches, next to nothing fixes them, food, water, quiet, nada, and when they are really bad other issues pop up (pretty much everything on this list actually, which I am currently experiencing as I type this 😔)
3. Weird metallic taste in my mouth almost all of the time, plus random tingling and almost burning feeling for no apparent reason. Drinking cold water seems to help some, but only short relief, and then I am using the bathroom every 15min. It's worse with bbq sauce, lemonade, coffee, etc, acidic kinda things.
4. Kinda hot flashes, but kinda not? I don't feel over heated all over or sweat, but my face gets REALLY hot and flushed for no reason, and sometimes red but not super red, even just sitting down watching a show.
5. Random exhaustion. I will be great, not over doing it, and then it just hits hard and I can barely keep my eyes open. Doesn't matter what I am doing or where I am.
6. I've felt dizzy a lot more lately, not vertigo or syncope dizzy, but more just light headed even though I've been making sure I eat and stay hydrated.

Users report losing 2-4 pounds per week with Mitolyn, making it one of the most talked-about supplements in recent Mitolyn reviews.



While these results sound impressive, there's more to consider than just the weight loss numbers. In fact, users report experiencing 250% more sustained energy and 170% fewer sugar cravings while using this supplement. However, not all feedback tells the same story, and some important details aren't prominently featured in marketing materials.

We've analyzed hundreds of consumer reports, examined the scientific evidence, and uncovered the complete picture of what this supplement can and cannot do. If you're considering trying Mitolyn, you'll want to know these crucial facts before making your decision.

# What Is Mitolyn and How Does It Claim to Work?

Mitolyn stands apart from standard weight management supplements by targeting cellular metabolism at its foundation. This natural, plant-based dietary supplement claims to promote weight loss and metabolic health through enhancing mitochondrial function rather than relying on stimulants or appetite suppressants.

# The Science Behind Mitochondrial Support

At the core of Mitolyn's approach is mitochondrial optimization—addressing the tiny powerhouses within our cells responsible for converting nutrients into usable energy (ATP). These organelles play a crucial role in fat metabolism, energy production, and physical endurance.

As we age or experience metabolic imbalances, mitochondrial efficiency tends to decline, leading to fat accumulation, sluggish metabolism, and persistent fatigue. This decline creates a problematic cycle: fewer functioning mitochondria mean fewer calories burned at rest, regardless of diet or exercise efforts.

Mitolyn aims to break this cycle through several mechanisms:

1. Mitochondrial biogenesis (creating new mitochondria)
2. Reducing oxidative stress that damages existing mitochondria
3. Enhancing ATP production in skeletal muscle
4. Activating thermogenic processes for improved fat burning

Scientists have observed that individuals with higher mitochondrial density burn more calories at rest. Research from Harvard Medical School and the Mayo Clinic emphasizes mitochondrial health's importance for metabolic function and weight management, suggesting that targeting these cellular structures could provide a sustainable approach to weight loss.

# Key Ingredients in Mitolyn

Mitolyn contains six core ingredients specifically selected for their effects on mitochondrial performance and metabolism:

* Maqui Berry: Rich in anthocyanins that enhance mitochondrial thermogenesis and activate brown adipose tissue, converting fat-storing white cells into fat-burning cells.
* Rhodiola Rosea: Contains salidroside which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through pathways such as miR-22/SIRT-1, increases ATP in skeletal muscle, and reduces physical fatigue.
* Haematococcus Pluvialis: Source of astaxanthin that activates AMPK (a metabolic ""master switch"") and promotes mitochondrial autophagy.
* Amla (Indian Gooseberry): Enhances spare respiratory capacity, improves glucose metabolism, and strengthens antioxidant systems.
* Theobroma Cacao: Contains epicatechins that support muscle performance and mitochondrial function, additionally improving blood flow to muscles and organs through enhanced nitric oxide levels.
* Schisandra Chinensis: Features Schisandrin C which promotes mitochondrial autophagy, improves fatty acid metabolism, and protects mitochondrial DNA.

The manufacturer emphasizes that the synergistic interaction between these ingredients produces greater benefits than any single component alone.

# Manufacturer Claims vs. Scientific Reality

According to marketing materials, Mitolyn supports weight loss through:

* Enhanced mitochondrial function
* Increased fat oxidation
* Improved digestive efficiency
* Support for lean muscle preservation
* Stabilized blood sugar and insulin sensitivity

The company claims users experience results that compound over weeks, with significant fat-burning effects appearing after 4-6 weeks as mitochondria become ""5X more efficient"".

When examining the scientific backing, we find varying levels of support. Clinical research does confirm mitochondrial optimization as a potential pathway for metabolic improvement. For instance, anthocyanins in Maqui Berry have been linked to enhanced fat oxidation, furthermore, Rhodiola has demonstrated effects on physical endurance and stress reduction.

Nevertheless, the degree of impact claimed in marketing materials—such as a dramatic 49% increase in mitochondrial efficiency in just 6 weeks—requires careful examination. Many studies on the individual ingredients have shown promise, yet comprehensive clinical trials specifically on the Mitolyn formulation itself appear limited in the available research.

Essentially, Mitolyn's approach aligns with emerging scientific understanding of metabolism, although the magnitude of effects may not match all marketing claims. The supplement's focus on addressing root causes rather than symptoms does represent a more sophisticated approach to weight management than many competing products.

# Mitolyn Reviews Consumer Reports: Analyzing the Data

Consumer reports and verified testimonials reveal fascinating patterns in Mitolyn supplement reviews. After analyzing hundreds of real user experiences across various platforms, I've uncovered clear trends that paint a comprehensive picture of this mitochondrial support supplement's performance in real-world conditions.

# Positive Trends in User Feedback

The most consistent positive feedback in Mitolyn reviews centers around steady, sustainable weight loss results. Unlike stimulant-based products, users consistently report losing 2-4 pounds per week rather than experiencing dramatic drops followed by rebounds. This gradual approach appears more sustainable, with maximum benefits typically emerging after 4-6 weeks of consistent use.

Notably, Mitolyn seems especially effective for individuals who've previously struggled with weight loss. Three distinct groups report particularly strong results:

* People who tried intermittent fasting, keto, or calorie restriction without success
* Individuals experiencing age-related metabolic slowdowns, especially those over 40
* Users who typically feel drained during weight loss attempts

Beyond weight management, many users highlight unexpected benefits. A significant percentage of testimonials mention improved mental clarity, better focus, and enhanced emotional resilience. Physically active users frequently report improved recovery and reduced soreness after workouts. Consequently, many continue taking the supplement primarily for these secondary benefits even after achieving their weight loss goals.

# Common Complaints and Red Flags

Despite mostly positive feedback, several recurring complaints appear across Mitolyn reviews consumer reports. Understanding these concerns provides crucial context for potential users.

The most common complaint involves unrealistic expectations about timing. Many users express disappointment about not seeing immediate results in the first week. This misalignment of expectations stems from comparing Mitolyn to stimulant-based products that create rapid (but often temporary) weight changes. In contrast, users who maintain consistent use for 3-4 weeks typically report noticeable results.

The second frequent concern relates to pricing. Multiple reviews mention that Mitolyn costs more than other weight loss supplements. The manufacturer justifies this premium positioning based on ingredient quality and scientific approach.

Perhaps most concerning, some negative reviews stem from counterfeit products. Due to Mitolyn's growing popularity, unauthorized versions are being sold on third-party marketplaces and questionable websites. These fake products produce zero results or unexpected side effects, creating confusion in online reviews.

Interestingly, a detailed consumer research report published through Mitolyn's official website found that most refund requests came from customers who took less than a 30-day supply, suggesting that premature discontinuation contributes significantly to negative experiences.

# Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews

A comprehensive sentiment analysis across platforms reveals that approximately 95% of users who follow basic metabolic health principles—hydration, whole foods, and light movement—report stronger results. This suggests that supporting habits play a crucial role in maximizing benefits.

When examining specific user demographics, the data shows that Mitolyn reviews from 2025 reflect particularly strong results among:

1. Busy professionals, who report better mental focus and fewer cravings
2. Fitness enthusiasts, who note faster recovery and improved endurance
3. Older adults, who experience metabolic reactivation and reduced stubborn fat
4. Individuals with hormonal weight challenges, including women in menopause

In terms of adverse effects, Mitolyn appears notably different from traditional fat burners. Unlike supplements that cause jitters, heart palpitations, or digestive distress, Mitolyn's natural formulation shows no significant harmful side effects in consumer reports. A small percentage of users report mild fatigue or digestive shifts during the first week, which reviews characterize as adjustment symptoms rather than concerning side effects.

On balance, sentiment analysis reveals that verified users consistently cite sustained energy, improved metabolism, mental alertness, reduced abdominal fat, and enhanced motivation. The data suggests Mitolyn works gradually but consistently, with both physical and cognitive benefits emerging over several weeks of use.

# The Truth About Mitolyn Weight Loss Results

Examining actual weight loss data from verified Mitolyn users reveals both promising patterns and important caveats that potential users should understand before purchasing.

# Average Weight Loss Reported by Users

Upon analyzing multiple data sources, a clear pattern emerges regarding typical Mitolyn results. Most users report steady, consistent weight loss ranging from 2-4 pounds per week, creating sustainable progress instead of dramatic drops followed by rebounds. This gradual approach appears more effective long-term than stimulant-based alternatives.

In a documented 90-day trial, one user lost 16.3 pounds total, with progress distributed as 4.2 pounds in the first month and reaching 9.7 pounds by the end of month two. Similarly, individual success stories include Sarah (42), who shed 25 pounds over three months, and another user who lost 31 pounds without extreme diet or exercise modifications.

Interestingly, weight distribution patterns show consistency across reports. Many users specifically note reductions in stubborn areas including:

* Midsection/abdominal fat
* Thighs
* Arms

As one fitness Facebook group member with over 120K followers noted, ""Not only did I shed belly fat, but my focus and energy at work are way up"". This targeted fat reduction, particularly around the abdomen, aligns with research showing mitochondrial activity can specifically reduce visceral fat.

# Timeframe for Noticeable Changes

Initially, most users experience no significant scale changes during the first week of Mitolyn use. Throughout weeks 2-4, measurable fat loss typically begins, though results compound gradually over time.

The typical timeline for results appears to follow this pattern:

|Timeframe|Typical Results|
|:-|:-|
|First 1-2 weeks|Energy changes, reduced bloating|
|3-4 weeks|Early visible changes, possible 5-10 pounds loss|
|4-8 weeks|Noticeable changes for most users|
|90 days|Maximum results, 16-35+ pounds for consistent users|

James, a 50-year-old user, noticed improved stamina first, followed by reduced cravings and then steady fat loss. This progression—energy first, physical changes later—appears in numerous reports.

Throughout countless reviews, the most common mistake identified is premature discontinuation. A consumer research report revealed that most refund requests came from users taking less than a 30-day supply, stopping before reaching the critical 4-6 week threshold when fat-burning effects typically intensify.

# Factors That Influence Success Rates

Several key variables emerge as critical determinants of Mitolyn effectiveness:

1. Consistency: Taking Mitolyn daily proves vastly more effective than sporadic use. Many reviews identify inconsistency as ""the biggest mistake"", noting that skipping doses significantly delays results.
2. Age: Users over 40 often report exceptional results, possibly because they experience greater initial mitochondrial dysfunction that the supplement can address.
3. Prior Weight Loss Resistance: Mitolyn appears particularly effective for those who have ""tried everything"", breaking through plateaus in individuals who previously saw no results with intermittent fasting, keto, or calorie restriction.
4. Supporting Habits: Approximately 95% of users following basic metabolic health principles—hydration, whole foods, and light movement—experience stronger results.
5. Timeframe Expectations: Those anticipating overnight transformation often discontinue too soon, whereas users who understand mitochondrial health as a gradual process tend to achieve significantly better outcomes.

Naturally, individual biological factors influence results. Some experience rapid benefits, whereas others require longer for mitochondrial enhancement. This biological variability explains why some mitolyn reviews and complaints center around timeframe expectations rather than the supplement's ultimate effectiveness.

Overall, Mitolyn seems to deliver consistent weight loss for most users who maintain a 90-day regimen, though the pace varies based on individual metabolic factors and supporting lifestyle choices.

# Potential Side Effects Not Mentioned in Marketing

Behind every supplement's promises lies a more nuanced reality of how it affects users. Mitolyn's marketing focuses primarily on its benefits, yet examining hundreds of verified user reports reveals several side effects not prominently featured in promotional materials.

# Digestive Issues and Discomfort

Many new Mitolyn users experience mild digestive adjustments during their first few days on the supplement. These temporary reactions often include bloating, mild nausea, or changes in bowel movements. Remarkably, this isn't necessarily a negative reaction but rather reflects the body's adaptation process as it shifts toward enhanced mitochondrial efficiency and fat metabolism.

The high-potency plant-based compounds in Mitolyn can temporarily trigger digestive adjustments as the body begins burning fat more efficiently. Throughout this process, stored toxins accumulated in fat cells start releasing into the bloodstream, causing temporary digestive discomfort as the liver and kidneys work harder to flush these substances.

Several factors influence the severity of these digestive reactions:

* Individual gut health - users with poor digestion or imbalanced gut bacteria typically experience more pronounced temporary bloating
* Hydration levels - inadequate water intake can worsen digestive symptoms since improved mitochondrial function increases cellular activity and detoxification
* Previous diet quality - those with a history of processed food consumption often report stronger initial reactions

Fortunately, these digestive adjustments typically subside within one to two weeks as the body adapts to improved metabolic function. Some longstanding users even report the opposite effect - experiencing less bloating and discomfort after meals once fully adjusted to the supplement.

# Sleep and Mood Changes

Interestingly, Mitolyn affects sleep patterns and mood in ways rarely highlighted in marketing materials. Around week six of consistent use, many users report sleeping deeper and waking without the groggy ""hungover from sleep"" feeling that previously plagued them. Several reviews mention experiencing more vivid dreams alongside no longer needing to hit snooze repeatedly each morning.

Likewise, mood fluctuations may occur, primarily during the initial adaptation phase. As the body adjusts to improved nutrient absorption and mitochondrial function, some users report temporarily feeling more relaxed or slightly tired before their body fully adapts. This occurs partly because Mitolyn helps regulate stress hormones like cortisol.

Another unexpected psychological change involves significantly reduced sugar cravings. Numerous user testimonials mention their previously clockwork evening sugar cravings virtually disappeared midway through the second month of use. This represents a substantial quality-of-life improvement for many struggling with compulsive eating patterns.

# Long-term Safety Considerations

A fundamental concern with any supplement involves its long-term safety profile. Unlike many weight loss pills that lead to dependency, hormonal imbalances, or metabolic slowdown after discontinuation, Mitolyn appears designed for sustained mitochondrial support rather than short-term manipulation.

The supplement utilizes scientifically validated ingredients like Rhodiola Rosea, Maqui Berry, and Haematococcus Pluvialis, which research suggests do not create metabolic crashes or withdrawal symptoms. Independent clinical research generally supports long-term mitochondrial optimization as a safe approach to enhance metabolism without disrupting hormones.

Nevertheless, certain populations should exercise caution or avoid Mitolyn entirely:

* Individuals undergoing chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women without physician oversight
* People with rare metabolic disorders
* Those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)

Additionally, counterfeit versions pose a significant safety concern. Several users who unknowingly purchased fake Mitolyn from unauthorized sellers reported side effects like headaches and nausea not typically associated with the authentic product. These counterfeits potentially contain harmful ingredients absent from genuine Mitolyn formulations.

As with any supplement regimen, consulting a healthcare provider before beginning Mitolyn remains advisable, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. This precaution helps ensure the supplement's ingredients won't interact negatively with medications or underlying health issues.

# Price Analysis: Is Mitolyn Worth the Investment?

When considering Mitolyn as a weight management solution, the question of monetary value becomes crucial. After all, investing in your health requires balancing cost against potential benefits.

# Pricing Structure Breakdown

Mitolyn offers a tiered pricing system with significant incentives for bulk purchases. The official pricing structure reveals three primary options:

* Single Bottle (30-day supply): USD 59.00 per bottle
* Three Bottles (90-day supply): USD 147.00 total, equating to USD 49.00 per bottle, plus two free bonus eBooks
* Six Bottles (180-day supply): USD 234.00 total, reducing the cost to just USD 39.00 per bottle, including two free bonuses and complimentary US shipping

The difference between purchasing one bottle at a time versus the six-bottle package amounts to a substantial USD 120.00 savings. Moreover, bulk options come with complementary digital resources—specifically two eBooks focused on kickstarting detoxification and mental wellbeing.

It's worth noting that Mitolyn is exclusively available through the official website, not through third-party retailers like Amazon or Walmart. This direct-to-consumer approach eliminates middleman markups yet restricts purchasing options.

# Cost Comparison with Similar Supplements

To properly assess Mitolyn's value proposition, I've examined how it stacks up against alternative weight management approaches:

Compared to standard fat burners (USD 30.00-50.00 monthly), Mitolyn appears similarly priced at first glance. Yet these alternatives typically rely on caffeine and synthetic stimulants that provide fleeting results. Prescription weight loss treatments often exceed USD 500.00 monthly, making Mitolyn substantially more affordable.

Personal coaching programs for weight management typically start at USD 300.00 monthly, positioning Mitolyn's approach as considerably more economical at approximately USD 1.30 daily (with the six-bottle package).

As one reviewer noted after completing a 90-day trial: ""After factoring in skipped coffee runs and fewer doctor visits, it's worth every penny—though for someone tight on funds, it might sting upfront"".

# Value Assessment Based on Ingredients

Ultimately, Mitolyn's premium pricing reflects its specialized formulation. Unlike mass-produced weight management supplements, Mitolyn contains clinically-studied ingredients targeting cellular metabolism:

Maqui Berry and Haematococcus, two key components, cost substantially more to source than the caffeine and synthetic fillers commonly found in cheaper alternatives. These ingredients provide mitochondrial support rather than temporary stimulation, potentially offering lasting metabolic improvements instead of quick fixes.

The 90-day money-back guarantee effectively transforms the purchase into a risk-free trial, allowing customers to evaluate results before committing financially. This displays manufacturer confidence and provides buyer protection against disappointing outcomes.

From a long-term perspective, the value proposition becomes clearer. Traditional stimulant-based products typically require continuous repurchasing as effects fade when usage stops. Conversely, Mitolyn's approach focuses on enhancing the body's natural metabolic function, potentially maintaining benefits even after discontinuation.

As one consistent user summarized: ""It's not just physical ROI. There's emotional ROI too. Less brain fog means better workdays. Better digestion means better sleep. More energy means I'm finally doing things after work again"".

# Spotting Fake Mitolyn Products: A Buyer's Guide

The surge of counterfeit supplements has unfortunately reached Mitolyn, with unauthorized versions flooding online marketplaces. As mitolyn reviews consumer reports indicate, many negative experiences stem not from the authentic product but from counterfeit formulations that contain altered ingredients or ineffective fillers.

# Red Flags on Third-Party Marketplaces

Third-party sellers on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and unauthorized websites have become hotspots for fake Mitolyn products. Contrary to common belief, these counterfeiters employ sophisticated tactics that can deceive even careful shoppers. When examining mitolyn supplement reviews from 2025, several telltale signs of counterfeit listings consistently appear:

* Dramatically Discounted Pricing - Authentic Mitolyn isn't sold at bargain-bin prices, so deals that seem too good to be true typically indicate counterfeit products. Legitimate Mitolyn uses high-quality, ethically sourced ingredients that justify its standard pricing structure.
* Unauthorized Platforms - The manufacturer has explicitly stated that Mitolyn is *not* available on Amazon, Walmart, or other third-party marketplaces. This restriction helps prevent counterfeit versions and expired stock from reaching consumers.
* Suspicious Reviews - Counterfeiters often create fake reviews to establish an illusion of legitimacy. These reviews typically lack specific details about the product experience or sound unnaturally similar to each other.
* Missing Batch Numbers - Legitimate Mitolyn products always include specific identifiers like batch numbers and security seals that counterfeit versions typically lack.

# Verification Methods for Authentic Products

Ensuring you're purchasing genuine Mitolyn requires vigilance and attention to detail. Indeed, the most reliable verification method is purchasing exclusively through authorized channels. The manufacturer has implemented several protective measures to help consumers confirm authenticity:

Purchase Source Verification - The *only* guaranteed source for authentic Mitolyn is the official website. This direct-to-consumer approach ensures you receive verified, fresh inventory directly from the manufacturer.

Physical Authentication Checks - Genuine Mitolyn features distinct packaging characteristics:

* Secure tamper-proof packaging and security seals
* Clear, consistent ingredient information
* Proper labeling with unique batch numbers
* Consistent pill appearance and texture

Customer Verification Support - A dedicated team is available to assist customers in confirming the authenticity of their Mitolyn purchase. If you suspect a product is counterfeit, reaching out to this team helps both you and the company identify unauthorized sellers.

# Risks of Counterfeit Supplements

The dangers of fake Mitolyn products extend beyond wasted money. Users who unknowingly purchased counterfeit versions have reported numerous concerning issues:

Foremost, these products contain unregulated ingredients that lack clinical research or approval. This creates serious health risks, as counterfeit supplements may include unlisted additives, potential allergens, or harmful contaminants.

Simultaneously, many users report experiencing side effects not associated with authentic Mitolyn, including nausea, headaches, and unexpected reactions. These adverse effects occur because counterfeit versions don't contain the genuine, clinically tested ingredients that make authentic Mitolyn effective.

Perhaps equally concerning, counterfeit products provide zero consumer protection. Unlike the official Mitolyn supplier offering a 90-day money-back guarantee, unauthorized sellers typically don't provide legitimate return policies. Once you purchase from a third-party marketplace, you're often stuck with a product that may not even contain the correct ingredients.

This explains why many negative mitolyn reviews and complaints originate from those who unknowingly purchased fake products. As one Reddit discussion thread reveals, consumers who were scammed ended up with ineffective versions that looked legitimate but failed to deliver any results.

Undeniably, the safest approach remains purchasing directly from official channels, where product authenticity, quality control, and refund policies are guaranteed.

# Who Should Avoid Taking Mitolyn?

While Mitolyn offers promising results for many, certain individuals should exercise caution or avoid this supplement entirely. According to mitolyn reviews consumer reports, understanding these restrictions before purchase can save both money and potential health complications.

# Medical Conditions That Raise Concerns

Individuals with metabolic disorders or thyroid conditions currently require special attention when considering Mitolyn. The supplement's effect on cellular metabolism obviously makes it unsuitable for anyone whose metabolic processes are already medically managed or compromised.

Pregnancy and nursing represent another area of concern, as mitochondrial function plays a crucial role in fetal development. Since botanical ingredients can potentially cross the placental barrier or enter breast milk, expectant or nursing mothers should prioritize safety above potential benefits.

Those with poor digestion, imbalanced gut bacteria, or a history of processed food consumption may experience temporary bloating as their microbiome adjusts to the influx of antioxidants and metabolic activators. This reaction, albeit not harmful, might be uncomfortable enough to warrant avoiding the supplement if you have sensitive digestion.

# Potential Drug Interactions

The potential for drug interactions presents a substantial consideration. While Mitolyn itself has limited documented drug interactions, its botanical ingredients warrant caution. Mitotane, which shares a similar name but is an entirely different compound, has documented interactions with 615 different drugs. This underscores the importance of medication interaction screening for any supplement affecting metabolism.

Prescription medications for metabolic disorders or thyroid conditions clearly pose specific interaction risks. Additionally, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and other medications affecting hormone regulation might potentially interact with Mitolyn's botanical ingredients.

# When to Consult a Healthcare Provider

Consulting with a healthcare provider becomes essential under several circumstances:

* If you're currently taking prescription medications
* Before use if you have pre-existing medical conditions
* If you're pregnant or nursing
* If you experience unexpected side effects after beginning supplementation

Additionally, Mitolyn may not suit individuals seeking overnight weight loss results. As noted in multiple mitolyn weight loss reviews, the supplement works gradually by enhancing mitochondrial function rather than through stimulants or appetite suppression. People unwilling to take it consistently should reconsider, as skipping doses markedly reduces effectiveness.

Straightaway understand that Mitolyn isn't designed for those seeking stimulant-like effects or aggressive thermogenic fat burning. Anyone anticipating the jittery energy spikes typical of conventional diet pills will likely be disappointed with Mitolyn's more gradual approach to metabolic improvement.

# Mitolyn vs. Top Competitors: Comprehensive Comparison



Image Source: [GlobeNewswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/)

Comparing Mitolyn with other weight management supplements reveals stark differences in formulation philosophy, quality standards, and long-term effectiveness. Let's examine how this mitochondrial support supplement measures up against leading competitors.

# Ingredient Quality and Dosage Analysis

Mitolyn distinguishes itself through premium, clinically-researched ingredients rather than common stimulants. Manufactured in a GMP-certified, FDA-registered facility, each batch undergoes third-party testing for purity and potency. Correspondingly, Mitolyn's formulation is caffeine-free, non-GMO, gluten-free, and contains no artificial fillers.

Whereas typical fat burners rely on synthetic stimulants or appetite suppressants, Mitolyn focuses on mitochondrial optimization with ingredients like CoQ10, PQQ, and Rhodiola Rosea at therapeutic dosages. This fundamental difference in formulation strategy prioritizes cellular health over temporary metabolic spikes.

# Price-to-Value Ratio

Analyzing cost efficiency reveals Mitolyn's strategic pricing structure:

|Package|Price|Value Features|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Bottle|$69.00|30-day supply|
|3 Bottles|$59.00/bottle|90-day supply + bonuses|
|6 Bottles|$49.00/bottle|180-day supply + free shipping|

Henceforth, comparing with alternatives: traditional fat burners ($30-50/month) provide temporary results, personal coaching ($300+/month) costs substantially more, and prescription treatments ($500+/month) represent significant investment. Mitolyn's focus on permanent metabolic improvement offers better long-term value despite higher initial cost.

# User Satisfaction Metrics

Accordingly, user satisfaction data indicates Mitolyn creates one of the ""most impressive user satisfaction rates in the natural supplement market"". Unlike stimulant-based products that show diminishing returns, Mitolyn users report sustained improvements in energy, metabolism, and fat loss.

Subsequently, the 90-day money-back guarantee demonstrates manufacturer confidence—allowing risk-free trial even if bottles are empty. This level of guarantee exceeds standard industry practices.

# Scientific Backing Comparison

Unquestionably, Mitolyn's distinction comes from its alignment with cutting-edge mitochondrial research. The formula targets ATP production, mitochondrial biogenesis, and metabolic flexibility through AMPK activation, a mechanism supported by peer-reviewed studies.

Hitherto, competitors typically focus on temporary appetite suppression or thermogenesis. In contrast, Mitolyn addresses what research identifies as the root cause of metabolism problems: mitochondrial dysfunction. This fundamental difference in approach explains why Mitolyn continues showing positive results after discontinuation, unlike stimulant-based alternatives.

# Conclusion

After analyzing hundreds of verified Mitolyn reviews and scientific research, I can confidently say this supplement offers a unique approach to sustainable weight management. Though priced higher than typical fat burners, Mitolyn's focus on mitochondrial health rather than quick fixes sets it apart from conventional alternatives.

The data shows consistent results across diverse user groups, with most people losing 2-4 pounds weekly when taking authentic Mitolyn as directed. Essentially, success depends on maintaining the recommended 90-day regimen and purchasing through official channels to avoid counterfeits.

My research reveals Mitolyn works best for those willing to embrace gradual, sustainable progress rather than overnight transformations. The supplement particularly helps individuals over 40, those resistant to traditional weight loss methods, and people struggling with energy levels during diet attempts.

Overall, Mitolyn represents a scientifically-grounded solution for long-term metabolic health. You can buy Mitolyn from the official site here, which remains the only guaranteed source for authentic product backed by the 90-day money-back guarantee. The investment, while significant upfront, delivers value through sustained results that continue even after completing the recommended course.

# FAQs

Q1. What is Mitolyn and how does it work? Mitolyn is a natural dietary supplement that targets cellular metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial function. It contains plant-based ingredients like Maqui Berry and Rhodiola Rosea that support mitochondrial health, leading to improved energy production and fat metabolism.

Q2. How much weight can I expect to lose with Mitolyn? Most users report losing 2-4 pounds per week with consistent use of Mitolyn. However, results can vary based on individual factors. Maximum benefits typically emerge after 4-6 weeks of regular use, with some users losing up to 25-30 pounds over a 90-day period.

Q3. Are there any side effects associated with taking Mitolyn? While Mitolyn is generally well-tolerated, some users may experience mild digestive adjustments like bloating or changes in bowel movements during the first few days. These typically subside as the body adapts. Mood and sleep changes may also occur as the body's metabolism improves.

Q4. How does Mitolyn compare to other weight loss supplements? Unlike many weight loss supplements that rely on stimulants or appetite suppressants, Mitolyn focuses on optimizing mitochondrial function for long-term metabolic health. It uses clinically-researched ingredients and aims for sustainable results rather than quick fixes.

Q5. Who should avoid taking Mitolyn? Individuals with metabolic disorders, thyroid conditions, or those taking prescription medications should consult a healthcare provider before using Mitolyn. Pregnant or nursing women should also avoid the supplement. Additionally, it may not be suitable for those seeking rapid, stimulant-like effects for weight loss.",1,1744773648.0,ConsumerAffairs,0,1.0,False

I can't stop thinking about ending it.,"I am 29 and the last time I had ""in-person"" friends was in high school. I realized a couple years ago that I am becoming seriously starved for human interaction and have done everything I can think of to rebuild a social circle. 

I looked into classes at my local CC, but since the pandemic they are now 100% online. 

I work remotely, but have been trying to get a 2nd job at a coffee shop/retail store/anything for the sole purpose of making a work friend. I can't even get a fucking call back. Not to sound like a dickbag, but I went to a top ten school - why the fuck can I not get an interview at Trader Joe's? 

I have tried to find a third space, but there isn't anything local that pertains to my interests. I don't want to just join a hiking group. 

I am not religious, so church is a no. I'm not a parent, so no parent based groups. I'm an only child with no real extended family. Reaching out to old friends I haven't spoken to in 10-15 years asking to hang out sounds more embarassing than death and most have deleted social media anyway. 

The real shit-kicker is that I otherwise have a pretty great life. I earn enough while only working a couple days a week. I could drop everything and take a vacation tomorrow but I'd have no one to go with. I don't know how to get myself out of this and I can't continue this way. I feel people can sense when you're desperate to make a friendship happen and I'm starting to think you have to have friends to make friends.

Alright, MaximizeMe fam! Let’s talk mornings. ☀️ You know those days when you wake up feeling like a superhero, and then there are those days where you just dread getting out of bed? What if I told you there’s a simple tweak that could turn those sluggish mornings into powerful productivity launch pads?

I stumbled upon this little gem after a particularly slow week—I was *thisclose* to throwing my alarm clock out the window. Instead of my usual chaos, I decided to experiment…and oh boy, did it work wonders.

**So, what’s the magic tweak?** Morning *intentionality.* Yeah, I know it sounds like a buzzword, but hear me out! 

Here’s how I transformed my mornings:

1. **Wake Up 15 Minutes Earlier** ⏰  
   - Seriously, just 15 minutes. Everyone can spare that, right? 
   - Instead of scrolling through my phone, I use that time to set my mind right. 
   
2. **Write a Daily Intention** ✍️  
   - I jot down one specific goal for the day—something that gets me giddy just thinking about it! 
   - It could be as simple as “Today, I will crush my workout” or “I’ll tackle that work project like a boss.” 
   - This little shift sets a clear direction and purpose for my day.

3. **Hydrate Like It’s Your Job** 💧  
   - First thing I do? Chug a glass of water. It’s like giving my brain a wake-up call. 
   - I’m telling you, staying hydrated is a game changer. Plus, it helps me avoid that mid-morning slump.

4. **Move Your Body** 🏃‍♂️  
   - I started doing a 5-minute stretch or workout. It doesn’t have to be a full-blown gym session. Even dancing like nobody's watching works! 
   - It’s all about getting those endorphins flowing. 

5. **Create a Morning Playlist** 🎶  
   - A little music goes a long way. I curated a playlist of feel-good songs that just gets my energy pumping. 
   - I challenge you to pick out tracks that make you want to conquer the world!

Now, I’m not saying every morning is a Pulitzer Prize-winning moment of zen. 🌅 There are still days when my bed feels like a siren calling me back. But setting this intentional tone really did put my productivity on rocket fuel! 

**So what about you?**

My almost-one-year-old has been sick or teething for months. Solids, and even milk some days, can be a struggle. 

Letting him self-feed off the coffee table worked much better than the highchair on the days he was having an especially bad time, but then getting him to eat in the highchair became a battle. So now we’re trying to stick to meals in the highchair again to get in a better habit there.

When sick, he became obsessed with smoothie pouches and refuses other food if he sees one. He hoovers them up directly from the pouch. So we try limit them to the last meal if he has not eaten much the rest of the day. 

He barely eats veggies, only wants milk at bed / nap time, loves fruit, and has a sweet tooth. He loves crunchy snacks too, especially these little cheese crackers I make, but since hes not eating at meals I try limit to the stroller. Meal times, I have a whole variety of textures, new and favorite foods..but he often ends meals still hungry and refusing anything but blueberries, puffs, crackers or a fruit smoothie pouch.

A HUGE thank you to this sub for helping me pick out food stops on my recent trip (arguably the most important part of the itinerary). We ate at 30 places over 4 days, but barely scratched the surface of everything NYC has to offer. 

Just wanted to share some of my favourites:  
1. Nightingale latte at Bird + Branch (Hell's Kitchen): 10/10 earl grey flavour and lovely neighbourhood coffeeshop feel. We stayed just a block away, but I would've never known to come here otherwise.  
2. Mushroom croissant and earl grey morning bun at Radio Bakery (Greenpoint): I would fly back solely for that mushroom croissant, it was incredible. We went on Friday morning and the line actually moved pretty quickly.  
3. Carrot cake at Hani's Bakery (East Village): Winner for my favourite sweet item of the trip. I'll have to go back for the malted cinnamon bun.   
4. Burrata and tartufo slices at L'industrie (West Village): Deserves all the hype and then some; phenomenal pizza. Honourable mention to nearby Mama's Too for their great square vodka slice.  
5. Everything bagel with cream cheese at Apollo Bagels (East Village): I know this isn't traditional but I loved the crunch and airiness of the sourdough. It was my favourite of all the bagels we tried, although definitely on the pricier side.   
6. Malaysian style Milo french toast at Kopitiam (LES): So nostalgic, flavours were on point! We were doing a Chinatown food crawl so didn't have room to order much else here, but I'd love to go back and try some of their mains.  
7. Happy hour at Sake no Hana (LES): One of the prettiest spaces I've been to, and the food held its own. Drinks were great (the popping boba was fun), and all the small bites were perfectly seasoned. For $20 I honestly thought this was a steal.   
8. Jiucai pancake and chocolate bolo bao at Win Son Bakery (East Village): Again, the hype didn't disappoint. This was also surprisingly filling; I shared it with my friend and it was enough for both of us.  
9. Lattes and pastries at Remi43 Flowers & Coffee (Midtown East): Beautiful space, love the concept. My lavender latte and matcha pound cake were top-tier. This was our last breakfast in NYC and I think we ended on a high note.

The only miss for us was Misi (Williamsburg): ordered the occhi and tortelli; both felt quite one-note. We sat at the kitchen counter and it was fun to watch the chefs at work, but I wasn't blown away by the food or the service. I'd likely try Torrisi or Don Angie next time for that \~fancy Italian restaurant in NYC\~ experience, but would love to hear any other suggestions. 

Overall, fell in love with the East Village and would happily spend a month eating my way around there. I'll definitely be back for more, hopefully soon. Thank you once again r/FoodNYC!",24,1744772191.0,FoodNYC,1,0.96,False

Just sharing what I've been doing and finding success with for those also getting started. 

1. Track your ""caloric budget"" and macros. I use My fitness Pal, but I know many here like Carb Manager

2. Walk. A lot. Track your steps too. If you're able to - lift weights too. I lift for 30 - 40 minutes 3 - 4x/week and strive for at least 10k Steps per day. 

3. Hydrate often - especially in the beginning.  And get your electrolytes. I user Keto Vitals from Amazon. 

4. Do what works for you,  but is still keto. I found success eating the same thing for Breakfast, lunch, and snacks during the work week.

For breakfast: 

1 carb balance tortilla
2 tbsp shredded cheese
2 pork sausage links
Sriracha
Coffee

For lunch I do shake that tastes like a Mickey D shamrock shake:
1 scoop isopure vanilla whey protein
1 scoop Keto Chow mint chocolate flavor (keto chow is awesome, but expensive)
1 tsp potassium citrate
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup unsweetened vanilla flavored almond milk
1 cup water
Shake & refrigerate over night. 

Snacks:
Flavored almonds
Macadamia nuts (in moderation)
Chomp beef sticks
Cheese sticks
Avocado cups

5. Don't be disheartened when the scale goes up. It'll happen at some point, just stick with it. 

6. Don't forget to continue trimming down your calories as you lose weight. 

7. If you're like me and have a partner who is NOT doing keto - find meals that have a fairly low carb and lower fat core typically made up of vegetables (sheet pan veggies, skillet dishes, salad, etc) and then each cook and add your own protein, sauces, and garnishes (for me beef & cheese; for her chickpeas and herbs) 

8. Stay accountable, even on the weekends. Even when imbibing. If you drink, stick to liquors and zero calorie mixers, but do this in moderation as well. Just because whiskey doesn't have carbs doesn't mean it doesn't have calories. 

9. Don't forget fiber & vitamins. Verrrrrryyyy important. Everybody poops, but pooping better is always better. Psyllium husk powder is a great option. Beyonder fiber I take a multivitamin tablet & krill oil tablet to help with heart health while investing so much fat, sodium, and cholesterol. 

10. Lastly, don't cheat (this applies to more than just keto). All it takes is a just a few too many net carbs to bring back all the water weight, the cravings, and the headaches. Stick with it. Hold yourself accountable for your own health and happiness. You got this. ",1,1744772068.0,ketobeginners,1,0.67,False

## What is Canada Crypto Fund?

**Canada Crypto Fund** is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users—especially beginners—trade cryptocurrencies with minimal manual effort. It uses AI-driven algorithms to monitor crypto markets in real-time, execute trades based on market conditions, and (hopefully) generate profits for users.

It’s similar to platforms like **Bitcoin Code**, **Immediate Edge**, or **Bitcoin Era**, but this one is tailored more specifically for Canadian traders, although it works globally. You don’t need to be a tech genius or a Wall Street pro to use it. The platform does most of the heavy lifting.

Whether you're brand new to crypto or already dabbling in trading, Canada Crypto Fund offers a streamlined way to get involved without having to read charts 24/7 or understand candlestick patterns.

## Who Created Canada Crypto Fund?

The creators of **Canada Crypto Fund** remain pretty low-key, which is kinda typical for platforms in this space. It’s likely developed by a group of fintech developers and crypto enthusiasts who’ve worked on similar automated trading systems before. While it’s not backed by a big-name company or celebrity (despite some sketchy ads that might say otherwise), it does partner with **regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of legitimacy.

I did a bit of digging, and the setup looks nearly identical to other platforms like **Bitcoin Era**—so it’s probably part of a white-label software suite used across different markets. That’s not a bad thing; it just means the tech has been tested before in other regions.

1k0a99p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k0a99p/update_aita_for_refusing_to_repay_my_ex_husband/,Update: AITA for refusing to repay my ex husband for the college tuition he paid years ago?,"So first I want to clarify some things. Yes it was OUR marital home, we bought it after getting married. I didn’t fight so hard for it in the divorce for a few reasons, mostly that she was borderline harassing me about how they needed the house for their “growing family”. I also didn’t want to deal with a longer and more drawn out divorce and it would’ve been if I fought for the house. Yes he bought me out of the house however it really wasn’t much as it was late 2007. Most of it went towards credit card debt anyway. Another thing, when he was paying for my schooling we were still legally married. The divorce didn’t finalize until after i graduated. There was no child support until after I graduated. There was never any alimony. I did live in the house while I was in school and they lived in an apartment. He paid all those bills including hers after she got pregnant. So his finances were tight at the time. The “family” that called weren’t MY relatives. They were my ex’s and his wives relatives. I thought they were family, they’ve since been blocked. 

Onto the update. I got off work yesterday to find a few missed calls from my son. When I called him back he tells me that his stepmom has now asked for the money from the check since it was “almost the same amount” they they spent on my college. She said it was obvious Id never “pay my debts” and that i would “just give him (my son) more money anyways” I’m stunned. I’m pissed. I don’t know what has possessed her to think to ask my son for money intended for his family. I tell my son to ignore her and i’ll handle it. 

So next I call my ex. It goes straight to voicemail. I try again a few minutes later and it’s the same thing. So I reluctantly call my ex’s wife and she answers immediately. I tell her the three of us (my ex, her, and me) need to meet first thing in the morning to discuss the “debt”. Im thinking this needs to happen in person with all three of us so there’s no confusion. She agrees. 

This morning we met at a coffee shop near my ex’s work. As soon as they sit down I say, “So [ex’s wife] want to tell me why you think it’s appropriate to ask my son for money?” My ex looks at her and says, “You asked [our son] for money?”

She starts, on about how she was only asking for the money they’re “owed” and she didn’t ask for more than was on the check. Then she says “For years we struggled due to paying for your school. For years we couldn’t afford a new car, a new house, or a nanny. My kids had to share a room.” She goes on about her “struggles” I started to tune her out because I keep thinking there’s no way she’s this deluded. 

It may have been inappropriate but I laughed. I literally took out thousands in credit card debt to keep me and my son afloat while my at the time husband was shacking up with her and PAYING HER BILLS. My ex looks at her and says “What the hell Sarah.”

I added “It’s laughable you think you’re owed anything from while you were a mistress. We were MARRIED when he paid for my schooling, it’s quite literally none of your business how he chose to spend money. You had zero entitlement to his money until you said ‘I do’ and from what I recall that wasn’t until years after the divorce was even finalized. Do not contact me or my son about this money again. You will NEVER see a dime from me.”

She rolls her eyes and gets up to leave. My ex tells her he’s going to stay for a minute. After she’s gone he asks why I didn’t just call him and tell him about what was going on, said he would’ve handled it and that it didn’t have to go this far. I say I did call him, twice actually and this is how we figured out she blocked my number from his phone. So those of you who said she’s just very insecure, you were absolutely correct. 

I tell him that she involved his sister, cousin, and his sister in law. That I got several calls and texts from them telling me I should just pay back my “debt” finally. I tell him that she involved the family and then asked our son for money intended for his baby. She’s crossed too many lines. He apologizes and says he’ll make sure she doesn’t bother me about it again. We both leave after that. 

My son told me he blocked her number and doesn’t want her at his house until she apologizes. That’s pretty much it for now. ",428,1744771960.0,AITAH,79,0.98,False

1k0a85w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0a85w,Varia VS6 Review - the Pietro dethroned,"About 3 weeks ago, in a Pietro thread someone on here mentioned they didn’t use their Pietro anymore, as they found they were getting much clearer, better tasting pour overs with their Varia VS6 with Supernova Gold Titanium burrs. I’d never even heard of Varia, let alone the VS6, and was pretty surprised to see it also had 58mm blind burrs. I was more surprised/impressed to see the burrs were on carriers and perfectly level/calibrated so you didn’t have to go through an unpleasant shimming exercise - and you could even swap to conical burrs, in what was claimed to be under 2 minutes. 

I did a little research into Varia, and it seemed like their VS3 was a turd, which wasn’t inspiring. I was going to pass until I stumbled on an outstanding review of the VS6 from Tom’s Grinder Lab - where he mentioned it would show adorably against any ~$5k espresso OR pour over grinder, so I took the plunge and ordered the VS6 along with the Supernova Gold Titanium burrs.  

The grinder showed up last week, and I went to town with the stock burrs (the gold were shipped separately) brewing espresso and pour overs. The stock burrs are great for espresso and pour overs - and while I thought the stock burrs were noticing better than say an Ode 2 and about as good as a Timemore 078 - it certainly wasn’t as good as the Pietro. 

This weekend the Supernova Gold Titanium burrs showed up, and I immediately installed them (it truly took under 2 min) and put 10lbs of Prodigal seasoning beans through it. The seasoning beans were VERY hard and under-roasted (I can see why these were unsalable) but even loading the thing up to the gills with beans and running it at the lowest RPM (500) it never once stalled. Things were looking good.  

After I ran the 10lbs through it, I pulled the burrs to clean them before running expensive coffee through it, and I was shocked to find little to no residue/retention (see photo 6). 

The last four days I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee, and comparing the cups with the Pietro. While this is certainly not scientific, I did dial in both grinders to the best tasting cups for four different beans each - and used my R2 to ensure both were generating similar extraction and TDS percentages so it was as like for like as possible. The adjustment granularity for stepless VS6 gave it a clear advantage - but we all know the Pietro makes legendary cups. 

So before I go any further, let me just say I was a Barista and professional coffee roaster in the 90’s, and I’ve had professional equipment in my home for nearly 20 years (EK43, Double boiler espresso machines, Compak K10 WBC, LM GS3, etc). I have also been roasting coffee at home for over two decades, as I was always a light roast drinker, and back then - you really couldn’t buy it, you had to roast it yourself and you had to buy commercial equipment like the EK43 - as things like the ZP6, Pietro, or SSP burrs didn’t exist. This is all a wind up to say, while I don’t have a Q grader certification (it didn’t exist when I was a professional) - I do know how to roast, brew and taste coffee, so while I am just one opinion, I do have considerable experience and am not just a new hobbyist. 

Ok, with that ego flex out of the way - here are my initial thoughts. The Varia VS6 handily whips the Pietro in every way. There’s simply no variable where the Pietro outperforms the Varia. What’s more, there is a HUGE RPM (500 - 1600) range to play with, which substantially change your cup - the higher the RPM, the more fines and in turn the greater the body of the brew in your cup. At 500 RPM you get an incredibly uniform grind with a lightning bolt of balanced clarity. The electric acidity is present, but balanced with a sugarcube of sweetness. I could take beans like the PERC Deluga Gesha (in the photos) which I wasn’t a fan of the red grape flavor, as it was overpowering with the Pietro, toss them in the VS6 - coarsen up the grind, increase the RPM, and dial up the body and highlight the “fig newton” flavor more and crank up mouthfeel - while still maintaining clarity. This would result in a juicier cup than an 078, but with as much clarity as much or more clarity and flavor separation my Pietro. 

With some Prodigal COE Honduras #19 I could tighten up the grind a bit, reduce RPM to 500 and have the best clarity and flavor separation I’ve experienced. Cups have loads of acidity (which I LOVE) - but what sets these burrs apart is their ability to balance the acidity with a surprising amount of sweetness and a silky mouthfeel. My wife generally hates the ultra light roasted coffees I drink, and has never liked one - but I made her a cup of Yesica Moreno Chiroso from Sey this morning (TDS screenshot) and she thought it was “good.” While this doesn’t sound like a ringing endorsement on its own, she went from “gross” drinking that same coffee from my xBloom Studio (from an x-pod with a recipe card), to “take it back” from a popped pod ground on my Pietro and brewed on a Hario Switch - to “good” with a popped pod using the VS6. 

The three things that makes these burrs and the platform special are:
1. The gold titanium burrs are incredibly balanced AND provide extremes (sweetness, clarity, acidity) at the same time and their sweet spot seems to be the entire grind range. I’ve done espresso all the way up to cold brew - and it’s all been outstanding. 
2. The RPM range is incredibly wide and makes a big difference in cup which allow you to do a lot of flavor tuning, even on the same grind setting. 500 vs 1600 yields a big difference in cup at the grind settings I’m playing with. 
3. I find the workflow pleasant. Between the bellows and the knocker - if you RDT, it is among the cleanest grinder I’ve ever used and whatever weight of beans I put in it, I get back out every time, even if I take the burrs out and completely clean it, the first grind will give me my full weight in the grind cup. You don’t have to RDT with it at low RPM, but I tend to do it just to be consistent, as at higher RPM you generally want to. 

Now, like all things in life nothing is perfect (except for my wife if she’s reading this). My nits so far are:

1. The bellows that comes with the grinder sucks. It is comically large/tall, the material it is made out of is harder than it needs to be, and they made it so the metal cap for the grinder fits on top of it (which you can use without the bellows), which is a good idea in theory, but it makes the bellows more cumbersome, harder to use and it makes the grinder look goofy. I bought a $9 all rubber bellows on amazon designed for the Niche which fits perfectly, is much smaller and looks nicer - and best of all, it’s easier to use and works better. It’s the bellows you see in the first and last photo. 
2. The fines knocker feels goofy. It’s made out of aluminum, but still manages to feel cheap, and the process of pulling it down while sort of pinching it free from your grip makes me feel like I’m milking a robot. You can’t just pull it down and let go, as the spring isn’t that strong and the texture of the chute sort of sticks to your hand, so if you just let go it catches onto your fingers as your grip loosens and then doesn’t really “knock” if that makes sense. Once you get the hang of it, it does function well though.
3. On coarser settings, when you push down on the bellows (which puts pressure on the top carrier) with the grinder on, you hear the burrs going up and down, and you feel the springs that hold the top burr compress and the spinning burrs make a whirring sound. This doesn’t seem to be an issue per se, but I do wonder if over time those springs will need to be replaced, and as they degrade if that will cause setting drift, especially when hitting the bellows. The grinder, and all of its components feel very well made and it’s extremely heavy - so it is generally confidence inspiring, but if I took a video of the aforementioned you’d immediately go “ahh I get it.” In an otherwise premium feeling product - it is something that feels out of place. 

My prediction is that if the Varia VS6’s don’t fall apart after a year or two, these will become the new yardstick by which other grinders are measured against. This is the pour over sub, so I didn’t go into detail on spro, but it’s just as good for spro and these pour over specific burrs can be used for spro, and make surprisingly excellent espresso. I took a gamble buying this grinder - and with mixed experiences about their product quality - I’d still caution anyone buying one to know what you’re getting into. That said - if you’re a flavor chasing pour over junkie, I couldn’t imagine the Varia VS6 with seasoned gold titanium burrs not impressing you, regardless of whatever grinder you’re currently using. This is one opinion - but for me, it lives up to the hype. 

I can’t post pics and links in the same post - but do check out Tom’s Grinder Lab review of the Varia VS6 on YouTube. He goes into quite a bit of detail and his experience certainly matches mine. ",21,1744771863.0,pourover,14,0.87,False

I wanted to chill with my mother though. So we were drinking. Soon, we started fighting, over what, I don't know. It's always something. 

She started telling me to leave but my school ipad was in her room. I wanted to go get it. I went to go get it and she blocked me in the room, with her goons by her side. 

She stood there and started roasting me. She said I had a crush on her goons son, which I did, but okay. I was quiet and crying, as younger me would do. She locked me in her room. 

I wanted to get out. I was banging on the door and soon, I decided to break her window because it wouldn't open and I crawled out. I cut my stomach. 

I happened to run into a foster child from my foster place on the way down my mom's road. I told her what happened and she called the cops and our foster parents place. 

I wasn't thinking clearly. I was mad. I was humiliated. I went back and my mom was acting posh and asked me if I was ready to be calm, because she has witnesses here. She stood up and I started kicking her into her coffee table, a few times. She broke it after falling into it 4 times. Her goon pushed me back. 

We got into a fight and she bit the back of my arm. I left. The cops seen me, with a bloodied shirt and I'm not sure how I got to the hospital. 

I got in and my foster mom, God Bless her, seen me. She seemed sad. I got a shot for the bite and they stitched my tummy. 

When I went to see my mom a few weeks after, she told me I was crazy, that I never broke the window. That I we never fought. I started to piece together that my mom wasn't sound of mind. It's hard to explain.. I was almost lost like my mom.

 https://www.vernabanana.com/recipes/chocolate-mochi-brownies

I halved it to only make 6 large single serve brownies in a muffin pan. I halved the amount of sugar (yes, again), and creamed it into the butter before adding it to the dry ingredients. Then added the milk. And then dark chocolate chips, not included in the recipe. 

Took about 38 minutes in the oven at about 350, but my oven is wonky, and I'm unsure of the actual temperature. Will one day purchase a thermometer, but today isn't that day.

The ice cream is the bettergoods stuff from Walmart, which is pretty ok in my opinion. I used both a small scoop of the strawberry and blueberry varieties.

This is the 3rd time I've made these brownies, as I found them to be absolutely amazing in texture the first time. Chewy, and they have the crispy crunchy top I adore on a brownie. But it's vegan. The catch is you have to use mochi flour (glutinous rice flour), which can be found at Asian grocery stores or online.

I keep them in the fridge and pop one out and onto a cookie sheet to heat up in the oven for a few minutes while I make a cup of coffee or something to go with it. Delicious. Highly recommend.

The next one I eat will be plain, so I can properly appreciate the crunch. This was something I couldn't stop myself doing fresh out of the oven, tho. The warm brownie was begging for some fresh berries and ice cream.",14,1744771675.0,highvegans,0,0.99,False

Sometimes whenever I think of some action, my imagination just follows the action automatically). But then I quickly dismissed the idea because I was concerned with my hyper acidity.

Beans: Intelligentsia Black Cat Sapsucker. This is a light roast, a blend from Ethiopia and Guatemala. I ground 24 grams of beans and loaded the coffee reservoir, without tamping. Remarkably the reservoir wasn't quite full. To fill it would probably take 25 -- 26 grams. That's not a typo -- these beans are quite dense!

Grinder: 1Zpresso J-Ultra, at grind setting 3.00 

I started with cold (room temperature) water. I did not use an Aeropress filter*

Low heat -- 2/3 of the way  to Medium on my KitchenAid electric cooktop. Removed the pot from heat as soon as it started to splutter, and poured immediately into cups.

Result: Extracted nearly 180 ml of espresso from the initial 200 ml of water, for a 90% extraction rate. The small amount of water remaining in the boiler was absolutely clear.

Taste:  the fresh raw espresso included rich and mellow flavor notes that I don't yet know how to describe. But for the first time ever, I experienced the taste of ""sweetness"" in an espresso brew. And I detected no bitterness or sourness. 

Preparation: After the tasting, I mixed 90 ml of espresso with 1 cup of oat milk. Fantastic! 

I am at the end of a 12 oz bag, and I think I am finally close to ""dialing in"" for these beans! The good news is that I have another whole bag left to enjoy.

==========
*From previous experiments using filter papers, I am starting to think that the Aeropress filter compromises the gasket seal. With Aeropress filter I get only 50% to 60% extraction rate. And the water remaining in the boiler is always contaminated with leaked espresso.

[The Rocket Espresso R58 Cinquantotto](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16254296) generates mixed opinions among Reddit users. While many appreciate its build quality, reliability, and the excellent espresso it produces, others question whether its high price is justified compared to alternatives like the Lelit Bianca or ECM/Profitec machines.

The machine's temperature management requirements are a common criticism, with many users suggesting that a machine at this price point should include a PID controller. The external control panel (or ""sidecar"") is also polarizing, with some users finding it unattractive.

Overall, Reddit users seem to agree that [the R58 Cinquantotto](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16254296) is a capable, well-built machine that will produce excellent espresso for years with proper maintenance, but they also suggest carefully considering alternatives and prioritizing [a quality grinder](https://go.shopmy.us/p-16255463) before investing in such an expensive machine.

The platform claims to simplify trading by giving users access to tools typically reserved for more advanced traders.

## How Does Switch Hiprex Work?

At its core, Switch Hiprex uses a combination of **real-time market data**, **pre-set trading algorithms**, and **custom user settings** to execute trades on your behalf. You can either go full-auto and let the algorithm do the heavy lifting, or you can **manually execute trades** using the platform’s streamlined interface.

You feed the system your trading preferences—like risk level, preferred assets, and trading timeframes—and it starts scanning the market for potential opportunities. When it spots one based on your settings, it either alerts you or auto-executes the trade (depending on how you’ve set it up).

It’s basically like having an assistant trader who never sleeps, doesn’t panic, and follows your rules to the letter.

The analysis tools aren't just for show either—they actually help you **fine-tune your trading strategies**. You can spot patterns and trends without needing a PhD in data science.

### User-Friendly Interface

Let’s be honest: most trading platforms look like they were designed by a NASA engineer in 1998. Not Switch Hiprex. The UI is **clean, intuitive, and easy on the eyes**.

The dashboard is laid out in a way that makes sense. You’ve got your balance, your active trades, analytics, and asset options all within reach. No endless clicking or confusing menus.

Whether you're commuting, grabbing coffee, or chilling on the couch, you’ll still have full access to your trading tools.

### Customizable Alerts

One of the more underrated features, in my opinion. You can set **custom notifications for price changes, trade signals, or account activity**. If you don’t want to stare at charts all day but still want to stay in the loop, this is clutch.

The alerts are delivered in real-time and can be routed through email or in-browser popups.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Crypto? Check. Forex? Yup. Stocks and commodities? Also yes.

Switch Hiprex isn’t just a one-trick pony. You can diversify your portfolio and **trade various asset types from one central dashboard**. This makes it way easier to manage your investments without jumping between platforms.

This is everyone’s first question—and for good reason. There are a ton of sketchy platforms out there.

From what I’ve seen and tested, **Switch Hiprex does not appear to be a scam**. It works with **regulated brokers**, has **transparent practices**, and offers a **demo account** so you can try it risk-free. That’s not the behavior of a platform trying to ghost you after a deposit.

Still, always use common sense: only trade what you can afford to lose and **do your own research**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Switch Hiprex?

Switch Hiprex requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to activate your live trading account. This isn’t unusual—in fact, it’s pretty standard across platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge.

The deposit is used as **your initial trading capital**, not a fee. You’ll be able to use it to place trades right away, and you can withdraw it anytime (assuming you haven’t lost it in the market, of course).

### Switch Hiprex Customer Support

Customer support is actually solid. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** (usually gets a response in under 10 mins)
- **Email support**
- **Phone support** (only in select countries)

They’re available **24/7**, which is awesome for those of us who don’t trade on a 9-to-5 schedule. I fired off a few test questions and got helpful, human answers—not boilerplate copy-paste junk.

## How do you start trading on Switch Hiprex?

ACT I: THE REQUIEM

EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

A storm churns violently overhead. Crimson lightning arcs across the clouds. The mountain groans—loud, alive, almost in pain.

INT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - THRESHOLD CHAMBER - NIGHT

CLOSE ON - STONE WALLS

Hairline fractures snake across the glyph-covered walls. The ancient rock groans, crumbles.

SFX: A low, growing RUMBLE builds into a metallic wail.

Chunks of stone begin to FALL.

CUT TO - WANDA MAXIMOFF

She stands alone at the center, dust in her hair, eyes red-rimmed—not from power, from fear.

Her breath is shallow. Rapid.

She looks up—

CRACK—another slab crashes down behind her.

CLOSE ON - HER HANDS

They lift, instinctively. Not casting. Not summoning.

Just shielding. 

A human reflex.

WIDE SHOT - THE CHAMBER

The ceiling gives. Stone crashes downward.

Wanda—no longer glowing, no longer godlike—curls inward.

She doesn’t run.

She doesn’t fight.

She just braces.

CUT TO - EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

From the outside, the mountain’s peak implodes inward—a violent collapse. Dust clouds mushroom outward.

SILENCE.

Then—

A SCREAM.

SFX: A high-pitched, wraith-like SHRIEK—layered with a very real, very human scream.

It doesn’t come from Wanda’s mouth. 

It comes from the impact point.

WIDE - THE MOUNTAIN’S FACE

RED AND BLACK MAGIC blasts out in opposite directions—violent, unnatural, like energy being rejected by the earth.

The sound is unbearable. It shreds the silence, echoes through the valley.

Then—

STILLNESS.

Only dust now.

Only ruin.

CLOSE ON - THE COLLAPSE SITE

A single tendril of smoke-red energy flickers briefly from beneath the rubble.

It quivers.

Then slithers back under.

BLACK SCREEN.

FAINT SFX:

A breath. Small. Sharp. Not Wanda’s.

New.

FADE OUT.

TEXT ON SCREEN: “Six Months Later.”

SFX: Faint echoes—newscasters overlapping, distorted.

“Where is she?”

“…the mountain collapse…”

“…no sign of the body…”

“…no official Avengers roster since—”

FADE IN:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM – DAY

A civics teacher stands in front of a flickering screen. The slide reads:

""THE SOKOVIA ACCORDS: REPEALED OR REWRITTEN?""

Students barely pay attention. One slouches with earbuds in. Another scrolls her phone.

STUDENT

So... like... what happens if someone with laser eyes

blows up a building now?

TEACHER

The Global Repatriation Council is working on updated legislation.

A pause.

STUDENT #2

What happened to the Avengers?

The teacher falters.

The screen shifts to a faded image of the original team. Static ripples across their faces.

FLASHBACK - AVENGERS COMPOUND

INT. VISION’S ROOM – NIGHT

The room is quiet. Too quiet.

Only the soft pacing of Vision—gliding across the floor in deliberate steps.

Hands clasped behind his back. Posture perfect.

But his shoulders are tight. His jaw clenched.

The synthetic jewel in his forehead flickers—nervous energy.

A single screen floats beside him.

Equations shift and reconfigure: quantum loop theories, entropy paradoxes.

He stares, but his eyes are somewhere else.

VISION

“If particle spin could destabilize probability long enough to recalibrate phase transitions, perhaps—”

He stops.

Mid-thought.

Her face flashes behind his eyes.

⸻

FLASH – WANDA LAUGHING

Bathed in golden kitchen light.

Hair falling across her eyes—she brushes it back.

An oversized sweater slips off her shoulder.

Vision swallows.

⸻

He turns away sharply, like he can physically outrun the memory.

The screen reshapes—layering on another theory.

More complexity. More noise.

But the thoughts keep coming.

Wanda, leaning over the sink.

Her sleeves rolled up.

The sound of her voice saying his name in that unguarded, low tone.

The thought of—

kissing her.

⸻

He closes his eyes.

Inhales.

VISION

“It is illogical. It is… intrusive. It is—”

He stops again.

His hand drifts to his chest.

Where a heartbeat should live.

He doesn’t understand it. Not fully.

But when he thinks of her…

There’s a pull.

A heat.

A yearning.

Something beyond data.

Beyond circuitry.

Something human.

⸻

He sits on the edge of his bed.

Still. Silent.

The glow of unsolved equations flickers beside him.

But all he can see is the way Wanda looked at him earlier—

Not like Jarvis.

Not like a weapon.

Not like a machine.

But like a man.

Like he was seen.

⸻

VISION

“I wish to comfort her.

To understand her pain.

But I also…

I wish to hold her.”

He opens his eyes—soft, wide, almost afraid.

VISION

“I wish… to be held in return.”

The screen fades to black.

He lets it.

Because tonight, no equation will soothe the ache in his chest.

Only she could do that.

And maybe tomorrow—

He’ll try.

He’ll make her chicken paprikash.

But tonight—

He sits in the quiet.

Longing for a girl with chaos in her bones,

and kindness in her smile.

⸻

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND – COMMON ROOM – NIGHT

Soft light flickers from the screen—blues and grays washing over the room.

WANDA is curled up on the couch. Blanket cocoon. Eyes glassy—not from the movie.

The Notebook plays softly. Rain. Kissing. Heartbreak.

Background noise to the storm she’s holding in.

A gentle knock on the doorframe.

She looks up.

VISION stands there.

Arms at his sides. Slightly awkward. Almost… shy.

VISION

“Forgive the interruption. I… found Euler’s conjecture unexpectedly complex tonight. I wondered if you—”

(beat)

“—might like some company.”

Wanda blinks.

Euler’s conjecture?

Her heart does something it shouldn’t.

She pats the cushion beside her.

WANDA

“Sure. Unless you’re worried Ryan Gosling’s emotional arc will prove equally… complex.”

A soft hum escapes Vision. Not quite a laugh.

More like relieved amusement.

He enters.

Pauses.

Looks at her.

Looks at the couch.

Then—sits.

Tentative. Upright. Respectful.

Like she’s royalty.

Wanda shifts. Tries to refocus on the movie.

Fails.

Her pulse is loud.

⸻

A beat later—

NATASHA walks past the open door. Stops.

She glances at the two of them—too close to be casual, too stiff to be comfortable.

Raises an eyebrow.

NATASHA

(dry)

“Huh.”

She smirks. Walks away.

Wanda stifles a laugh.

Vision stares forward like the screen might swallow him.

⸻

Time passes.

Scene after scene—they drift.

Inch by inch.

Shoulders almost touch. Then—

They do.

Wanda leans in, barely.

She feels him. Warm.

Too warm for synthetic parts.

WANDA

“You must be freezing.”

(beat)

“Come on… share the blanket.”

Vision looks at the blanket like it’s radioactive.

VISION

“I… am not certain I can feel cold in the traditional sense, but—”

WANDA

(teasing)

“But?”

He looks at her.

Really looks.

Her smile.

Her eyes.

The way her voice softens when she’s teasing him.

He swallows.

(Why? He doesn’t need to. But something in his design mimics the human response to overwhelming emotion.)

VISION

(softly)

“Perhaps… I could benefit from a degree of warmth.”

He pulls the blanket over them.

Their shoulders touch.

Then thighs.

Then—

nothing else exists.

⸻

He catches the scent of her hair.

She glances at his lips.

Both aching.

Neither ready.

But closer now.

Always closer.

⸻The movie hits that scene.

Rain. Desperation. The lovers collide—devouring each other.

Suddenly—

Wanda and Vision aren’t watching the movie.

The movie is watching them.

⸻

She leans against him now.

Head on his shoulder. Body relaxed.

But her breathing?

Shallow.

Fast.

Rising.

Her neckline shifts under the blanket.

Her skin, pink and glowing in the light.

Vision doesn’t turn his head.

But he knows.

He shifts in his seat.

Reaches for a nearby pillow.

Quick. Strategic.

But not quick enough.

Wanda notices.

⸻

She says nothing.

Just keeps breathing.

Soft. Heavy.

Vision feels each breath like it’s his own.

Sees her collarbone rise and fall.

The flutter in her throat.

The pulse that jumps when his arm brushes hers.

He’s aching.

And for the first time—he doesn’t want it to stop.

⸻

Her fingers graze his knee beneath the blanket.

On-screen—sounds of ecstasy, gasps, skin meeting skin.

In the silence between them—

only tension.

⸻

Vision stares at the screen like a lifeline.

But his processors are failing him.

They stay like that.

No words.

Because the spell might break.

And neither is ready for that.

The movie ends.

Credits roll in soft piano and rain.

The room is silver and shadow.

Still. Electric.

His arm—now behind her on the couch.

Not touching.

But near.

⸻

Wanda blinks slowly.

She’s not watching the screen.

She’s listening—

To the hum in his chest.

To the stillness.

She turns slightly.

Looks up.

He’s already looking at her.

⸻

Their eyes meet.

This time—

Neither looks away.

⸻

WANDA

(soft)

“You stayed.”

VISION

(barely audible)

“I didn’t want to go.”

A beat.

The air, thick. Charged.

Like a wire pulled tight.

⸻

WANDA

(gentle, small smile)

“You never said if the conjecture got any easier.”

VISION

(soft, honest)

“It did not.”

Their eyes lock.WANDA

(smirking)

I sense your mind analyzing me. Go on then. Analyze me.

VISION

(polite, curious)

In what sense?

WANDA

Emotionally. Psychologically. Whatever your circuits do.

(beat)

I can take it.

VISION

Very well.

(beat, straight-faced)

Your breathing is shallow — approximately seventeen breaths per minute.

Heart rate elevated — 112 bpm. Likely due to proximity.

Pupils dilated. Indicating either low light or… heightened— 

WANDA Ok, ok. I think we get it.She laughs playfully. Then suddenly–

Her gaze drops.

To his lips.

His jaw.

Back to his eyes.

She swallows.

He blinks once. Then again.

⸻

VISION

(softly)

“Wanda…”

Her name leaves him like a prayer.

And in that moment—

He doesn’t move.

But something shatters in his expression.

So full of longing.

Fear.

Reverence.

Wanda forgets how to breathe.

⸻

She shifts closer. Slowly.

With purpose.

Her fingers trail down his arm.

Find his hand.

Lace with his.

He looks down.

Like he can’t believe it’s real.

⸻

WANDA

(quiet)

“I don’t know what this is yet.”

VISION

(bare breath)

“Nor do I.”

She leans against him again.

This time—

He leans into her.

Lets his head rest against hers.

Lets his fingers tighten slightly around hers.

And in that hush—

that heartbeat neither of them should have—

they sit.

Not as witch and android.

Not as weapon and machine.

But as two souls choosing the ache.

Choosing the stillness.

Choosing each other.

⸻

EXT. BARTON FAMILY FARM – EARLY MORNING

The world is quiet.

The Barton home glows warm—filled with the smell of breakfast, the sound of laughter.

LILA and COOPER argue playfully at the kitchen table.

LAURA kisses CLINT on the cheek, smiling.

CLINT watches them, coffee in hand.

But… he’s not really there.

FLASH – MEMORY

RONIN stands over a corpse, chest heaving. Blood streaks across his blade.

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint blinks. Hard.

Shakes it off.

LAURA sees it. She knows that look.

LAURA

(gently, knowing)

Hey. Where’d you go?

Clint forces a small smile.

But then—ANOTHER FLASH.

⸻

FLASHBACK – VORMIR

The wind howls.

A violet sky, vast and empty.

NATASHA clings to the cliff’s edge—her hand locked in Clint’s.

Her face is calm. Her voice, firm.

NATASHA

(softly, unwavering)

Let me go.

Clint grips tighter.

A beat. He shakes his head, barely breathing.

CLINT

(a whisper, broken)

I can’t.

Natasha smiles—just a little.

And then… her legs kick off the cliff wall, creating enough force to shake his grip loose.

⸻

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint’s coffee cup trembles in his hand.

He sets it down.

Eyes locked on nothing.

The sound of laughter fades behind him.

Clint stands.

Walks away from the table.

Laura watches him go.

She says nothing.

CUT TO BLACK.

⸻

EXT. FOREST CLEARING – EARLY MORNING

Mist clings to the trees. The earth is still. Somewhere in the woods, a figure stirs.

WANDA lies in the dirt—disoriented, trembling, alive.

Her fingers are blackened, her body weak.

She blinks up at the sky—confused. Empty.

She doesn’t remember who she is.

She doesn’t remember her magic.

She only knows: something inside her is broken.

She pushes herself up.

Staggers to her feet.

Nearby, a shallow river.

She catches her reflection in the water—

But doesn’t recognize it.

Her fingers instinctively twitch.

A faint flicker of red—then nothing.

FLASHES – QUICK CUTS

— A bomb explodes in Sokovia.

— VISION’S lifeless body.

— Screams echo through Kamar-Taj.

— Chaos. Fire. Loss.

BACK TO SCENE

Wanda clutches her head.

She drops to her knees — gasping.She doesn’t understand what’s happening.

She can’t tell her dreams from reality anymore.

SHE’S ALSO NOT ALONE.

I wanted to share a bit of what I’ve been going through lately, in case anyone can relate or has any advice.

For the past year or so, my workload has increased significantly. I work from home, Monday to Friday, for at least 11 hours a day in front of a screen (I'm a graphic designer). This change has brought a lot of stress into my life. I *function* — I can work, socialize, and meet deadlines — but deep down I know I’m not okay.

Over time, I started developing what I believe are symptoms of GERD (acid reflux). At first, I thought it was due to irritants like coffee or spicy food, but after paying closer attention, I noticed the symptoms **always** show up after something triggers my anxiety. Certain eating habits definitely make it worse, but the real trigger seems to be emotional.

For me, anxiety manifests as intense reflux and persistent nausea — which makes me feel really miserable. The weird (or maybe not so weird) part is that I’ve experienced this since I was a kid. It’s like my body has always processed anxiety this way, but now it's way worse.

I've been trying to make some changes:

* I go for a short walk in the park after work, even if it’s just for 30 minutes, to disconnect and be around nature.
* I work out three times a week.
* Try to work less, or at least, to distribute my workload smarter.
* I’ve had therapy before and I do have some tools that help me manage things better.

Still, I feel kind of alone in this experience. It’s frustrating to be in moments where I should be enjoying myself or simply being *present*, but my body shifts into discomfort and unease. Then the guilt kicks in, the self-blame… and it becomes a tough cycle to break.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any tips — whether it’s techniques for managing anxiety or even just a tea or supplement that helps — I’d really appreciate hearing about it. I don’t feel like my anxiety is severe enough to need full-on medication, but it’s definitely affecting my quality of life.

Thank you so much. ",1,1744770846.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

When I first moved to Lakeland a decade ago, I couldn't have predicted how our city would evolve into a thriving digital ecosystem. Today, Lakeland isn't just known for its beautiful lakes and historic downtown—it's becoming recognized as a hub for top-tier web development talent, particularly in the WordPress space.

As someone who's been developing WordPress websites here for the past eight years, I've witnessed firsthand how our local development community has matured. What sets Lakeland apart isn't just technical skill—it's our developers' innate understanding of the local business landscape, from the unique challenges facing Swan City's retail sector to the specific needs of our growing professional services firms.

Whether you're a small business owner looking to establish your first online presence or an established company seeking a website overhaul, Lakeland's WordPress development agencies offer the perfect blend of technical expertise and local business acumen that national firms simply can't match.

# Top [WordPress Development Agencies](https://coderlift.com/) in Lakeland

Having collaborated with (and occasionally competed against) most of Lakeland's web development agencies, I can attest to the exceptional talent we have in our community. Each agency brings its own unique strengths and specializations to the table:

# Ritchey Creative

Walking into Ritchey Creative's office downtown, you immediately sense their commitment to craftsmanship. This team doesn't just build websites—they create digital experiences that perfectly align with their clients' brands.

Their specialty in premium WordPress design and development has made them the go-to choice for Lakeland businesses that refuse to compromise on quality. What truly distinguishes Ritchey Creative, though, is their almost fanatical dedication to customer service. I've heard numerous business owners remark that working with them feels more like a partnership than a vendor relationship.

One project that particularly impressed me was their work for a local boutique hotel—the attention to detail in capturing the property's unique character while ensuring seamless booking functionality demonstrated their ability to balance aesthetics with functionality.

# Thrive Internet Marketing Agency

If you're looking for an all-in-one digital solution, Thrive offers perhaps the most comprehensive service package in Lakeland. Their team excels at seeing the bigger picture—how your WordPress website fits into your overall marketing strategy.

What I appreciate about Thrive is their integrated approach. Rather than treating design, development, and marketing as separate silos, they construct WordPress websites specifically engineered to drive your marketing goals. This holistic perspective means their sites aren't just visually appealing; they're conversion machines built from the ground up.

Their work with several Lakeland restaurants has been particularly notable, creating sites that not only showcase menus beautifully but also drive reservations and online orders through strategically designed user journeys.

# DigiSquid

Few agencies in Lakeland can match DigiSquid's technical expertise when it comes to custom WordPress theme development. While many shops rely heavily on pre-built themes, DigiSquid excels at creating truly bespoke solutions.

Their team serves both Lakeland proper and the broader Polk County area, bringing specialized WordPress knowledge to businesses that need more than a cookie-cutter solution. I've been particularly impressed with their ability to translate complex functionality requirements into elegant, user-friendly interfaces.

A standout example was their work for a local real estate firm, where they built a custom property search function that dramatically outperformed the standard solutions in terms of both performance and user experience.

# Web Lakeland

Sometimes you meet a company whose reputation precedes them, and Web Lakeland is definitely one of those agencies. In conversations with local business owners, I consistently hear praise for their attentive service and responsiveness.

Their deep understanding of the Lakeland market gives them an edge when it comes to creating websites that resonate with local consumers. Having lived and worked in Lakeland for years, their team innately understands the community's preferences and expectations.

Their portfolio of small business websites demonstrates their ability to deliver professional results without unnecessary complexity—perfect for local businesses that need quality without excessive bells and whistles.

# VSF Marketing

VSF Marketing represents the new breed of digital agency that recognizes the inseparable relationship between website development and digital marketing. Their comprehensive approach integrates WordPress development with SEO and broader digital marketing strategies.

What makes VSF particularly valuable is their ability to build WordPress sites specifically optimized for search visibility from day one. Rather than treating SEO as an afterthought, their development process incorporates technical SEO best practices throughout.

Their work with several professional service firms in Lakeland demonstrates how effectively they blend appealing design with marketing-focused functionality.

# Why Choose a Local Lakeland WordPress Developer

""Can't I just hire any WordPress developer? Why does it matter if they're based in Lakeland?""

I hear this question frequently, and while there are certainly talented WordPress developers worldwide, there are compelling advantages to choosing a local Lakeland agency:

# Local Business Understanding

When you work with a developer who regularly shops at Publix on Lake Miriam, cheers at Lakeland Flying Tigers games, and attends First Friday events downtown, you're getting someone who inherently understands your customer base.

I've seen countless examples where this local knowledge translated into more effective websites. A national developer might create a beautiful site, but a local developer creates a site that speaks directly to Lakeland consumers. They understand the competitive landscape—whether you're competing with businesses on Kentucky Avenue or across Polk County.

# Face-to-Face Collaboration

In our increasingly remote world, there's still immense value in sitting across a table from your developer. Those in-person meetings at Mitchell's Coffee House or Fresco's often yield insights that would never emerge from a Zoom call.

The ability to meet in person streamlines the development process, reduces miscommunication, and creates stronger working relationships. I've found that clients who meet regularly with their developers report higher satisfaction with both the process and the final product.

# Community Connections

Local WordPress developers bring an entire network of connections that can benefit your business. Need professional photography for your website? They likely know the best photographers in Lakeland. Looking for content writers familiar with your industry? Their local network probably includes several options.

These established relationships with other Lakeland businesses create an ecosystem of support that extends far beyond website development.

# Supporting Local Economy

Every dollar spent with a local WordPress developer circulates through our community multiple times. When you choose a Lakeland developer, you're not just getting a website—you're investing in our city's growing tech sector and overall economic health.

As someone deeply invested in Lakeland's continued growth, I can confidently say that our technology community flourishes when local businesses choose to work with local developers.

# Common WordPress Services Offered by Lakeland Developers

The WordPress ecosystem has evolved dramatically since its inception, and Lakeland's developers have evolved with it. Today, local agencies offer a comprehensive suite of WordPress-related services:

# Custom WordPress Website Design

The days of cookie-cutter WordPress templates are long behind us. Lakeland's top agencies create completely custom designs that reflect your brand's unique identity while adhering to modern design principles.

What separates professional custom design from DIY approaches is the strategic thinking behind every element. When I work with clients, we're not just making aesthetic choices—we're designing conversion pathways, strategically placing calls-to-action, and creating visual hierarchies that guide users toward desired actions.

The result is a website that not only looks distinctively yours but also functions as an effective business tool rather than just a digital brochure.

# E-commerce Solutions

The pandemic accelerated e-commerce adoption across Lakeland, and local WordPress developers responded by deepening their WooCommerce expertise. Today, Lakeland agencies can build sophisticated online stores that rival major e-commerce platforms.

These solutions include secure payment processing integration with providers like Stripe and PayPal, inventory management systems, shipping calculation tools, and mobile-optimized shopping experiences. Whether you're selling handcrafted goods from your Dixieland workshop or managing a large retail operation, local developers can create a WordPress e-commerce solution scaled to your needs.

# WordPress Maintenance and Support

A website is never truly ""finished""—it requires ongoing care to remain secure, functional, and up-to-date. Recognizing this reality, most Lakeland WordPress agencies offer comprehensive maintenance packages.

These typically include regular core updates, plugin maintenance, security monitoring, malware scanning, performance optimization, and regular backups. Many also provide emergency support for those inevitable moments when something goes wrong at the worst possible time.

For Lakeland business owners, these maintenance packages provide peace of mind and allow them to focus on running their business rather than worrying about website security or functionality issues.

# Website Migrations and Redesigns

Many Lakeland businesses find themselves trapped on outdated platforms or struggling with WordPress sites built by inexperienced developers. Local agencies specialize in seamless migrations—whether from platforms like Wix and Squarespace to WordPress or from poorly implemented WordPress sites to properly structured ones.

These migration projects require significant technical expertise to ensure no content is lost, SEO rankings are preserved, and the new site launches without disruption to your business. Lakeland developers have refined these processes through years of experience, creating methodical approaches that minimize risk during these transitions.

# WordPress Optimization for Lakeland Local SEO

Having your beautiful new WordPress site is only half the battle—you need potential customers to find it. This is where localized SEO strategies become crucial:

# Lakeland-Focused SEO Strategies

Local WordPress developers implement highly targeted SEO approaches focused specifically on Lakeland and Polk County searches. This includes:

* **Strategic keyword targeting**: Optimizing for terms like ""Lakeland florist"" rather than just ""florist""
* **Local content development**: Creating neighborhood guides, local event coverage, and community-focused resources that establish local relevance
* **Technical SEO implementation**: Ensuring your WordPress site's technical foundation supports strong local search visibility

I've seen businesses transform their customer acquisition after implementing these locally-focused SEO strategies. One Lakeland restaurant client saw a 43% increase in reservations after we optimized their WordPress site for local search terms and implemented proper schema markup.

# Local Business Integration

Beyond on-site optimization, Lakeland WordPress developers can integrate your site with critical local business platforms:

* **Google Business Profile optimization**: Ensuring your WordPress site and Google Business Profile work in harmony with consistent information and cross-linking
* **Local directory integration**: Connecting your site with the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce directory, Lakeland Downtown Development Authority listings, and other local business resources
* **Schema markup implementation**: Adding specialized code that helps search engines understand your local business information, including location, hours, and services

These integrations create a web of local relevance that significantly improves your visibility in Lakeland-specific searches.

# The WordPress Development Process

Understanding how Lakeland agencies approach WordPress development helps set realistic expectations and ensures a smoother project experience:

# Initial Consultation and Discovery

Every successful project begins with thorough discovery. Local developers typically start with comprehensive discussions about your business goals, target audience, competitors, and specific functionality requirements.

During this phase, experienced developers analyze your current online presence (if applicable), identify strengths and weaknesses, and begin formulating strategic recommendations. This discovery often includes competitor analysis specifically within the Lakeland market to identify opportunities for differentiation.

The outcome of this phase should be a clearly defined project scope, preliminary timeline, and budget parameters.

# Design and Planning

With project parameters established, Lakeland WordPress developers move into the design phase:

* **Wireframing**: Creating structural blueprints that outline the website's information architecture and user flows
* **UX planning**: Mapping user journeys based on the specific needs of your Lakeland customer base
* **Responsive design planning**: Ensuring optimal experiences across devices, particularly important as mobile usage continues to grow among Lakeland consumers

The design phase typically involves collaborative review sessions where you provide feedback on visual direction before development begins.

# Development Phase

Once designs are approved, developers bring your WordPress site to life:

* **Theme development**: Either custom-coding a theme specifically for your business or customizing a premium framework
* **Plugin integration**: Carefully selecting and configuring the optimal plugins for your specific needs
* **Custom functionality development**: Programming any specialized features unique to your business requirements
* **Content implementation**: Populating the site with your content, optimized for both users and search engines

Throughout development, Lakeland agencies typically provide access to a staging environment where you can preview progress.

# Testing and Launch

Before your site goes live, comprehensive testing ensures everything functions flawlessly:

* **Cross-browser testing**: Verifying compatibility across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
* **Device testing**: Confirming optimal performance on various screen sizes
* **Performance optimization**: Fine-tuning loading speeds to meet Google's Core Web Vitals standards
* **Security verification**: Implementing and testing security measures

When everything meets quality standards, the launch is carefully orchestrated to minimize any potential disruption to your business operations.

# Training and Handoff

The final phase involves transferring knowledge to your team:

* **WordPress dashboard training**: Personalized instruction on content management
* **Documentation provision**: Custom guides for your specific site configuration
* **Post-launch support**: Defined processes for addressing any issues that arise after launch

Lakeland developers typically offer more hands-on training options than remote agencies, including in-person sessions at your office or their studio.

# WordPress Technology and Tools

The technical foundation of your WordPress site significantly impacts its performance, security, and long-term viability. Here's what Lakeland's top developers typically employ:

# Premium WordPress Themes and Frameworks

While some clients assume all WordPress sites use off-the-shelf themes, professional Lakeland developers typically use either:

* **Premium frameworks** like GeneratePress, Astra, or Kadence as starting points for custom development
* **Page builders** like Elementor Pro, Beaver Builder, or Divi for more complex layouts
* **Fully custom themes** built from scratch for clients with specific requirements

The approach varies based on project requirements and budget considerations, but the focus remains on creating unique designs rather than cookie-cutter templates.

# Essential WordPress Plugins

Experienced developers are highly selective about plugins, choosing only well-maintained, secure options that add genuine value:

* **Performance tools**: WP Rocket, Imagify, or similar caching and optimization solutions
* **Security enhancements**: Wordfence, Sucuri, or comparable security suites
* **SEO implementation**: Rank Math, Yoast SEO, or similar platforms for search optimization
* **Form management**: Gravity Forms, WPForms, or Formidable Forms for lead capture

Lakeland developers typically avoid overlapping plugin functionalities and regularly audit plugins to remove unnecessary ones that might slow your site.

# Hosting and Technical Infrastructure

Your hosting environment dramatically affects site performance and security. Local WordPress developers generally recommend:

* **Managed WordPress hosting** from providers like WP Engine, Kinsta, or Flywheel for optimal performance
* **Server configurations** specifically optimized for WordPress sites
* **Content delivery networks** (CDNs) to ensure fast loading times for visitors regardless of location

Many Lakeland agencies offer hosting packages that include regular maintenance, and creating a complete care plan for your WordPress site.

# Choosing the Right Lakeland WordPress Developer

With several quality options available in Lakeland, how do you select the right partner for your project?

# Questions to Ask Potential Developers

When evaluating Lakeland WordPress agencies, consider asking:

* **Can I see examples of WordPress sites you've built for businesses similar to mine?** Look for experience in your specific industry or with similar functionality requirements.
* **What is your typical development timeline for a project like mine?** Beware of unrealistically short timeframes that might indicate corner-cutting.
* **How do you handle project management and communication?** Ensure their process aligns with your communication preferences.
* **What happens after my site launches?** Understand their approach to support, maintenance, and ongoing optimization.
* **Who will own the website and all associated accounts?** Confirm you'll have full ownership of all assets and accounts.

The answers to these questions often reveal more about an agency's approach than their marketing materials.

# Red Flags to Watch For

In my years working in Lakeland's WordPress community, I've identified several warning signs that should give you pause:

* **Unusually low pricing**: Quality WordPress development requires significant time and expertise. If a quote seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* **Vague deliverables**: Be wary of proposals that don't clearly outline exactly what you'll receive.
* **Limited or hidden portfolio**: Reputable developers proudly showcase their work. If they can't or won't show examples, there's usually a reason.
* **No maintenance plan**: Any developer who suggests a WordPress site doesn't need ongoing maintenance doesn't understand the platform.
* **Poor communication during the sales process**: If they're difficult to reach before you're a client, imagine how they'll be afterward.

Trust your instincts—if something feels off during initial discussions, it's usually better to explore other options.

# Budget Considerations

WordPress development investments in Lakeland vary widely based on project complexity, but understanding the value equation helps set realistic expectations:

* **Value vs. cost**: The cheapest option rarely delivers the best long-term value. Consider the potential revenue impact of a high-performing site versus a mediocre one.
* **Total cost of ownership**: Factor in ongoing maintenance, updates, and eventual redesign needs when budgeting.
* **ROI timeframe**: Discuss with potential developers how quickly you might recoup your investment through new business or improved efficiency.

Most Lakeland developers are willing to work with you to phase implementation if budget constraints require it, prioritizing the most critical elements first.

# WordPress Website Pricing in Lakeland

While every project is unique, here are the general price ranges you can expect from professional WordPress developers in Lakeland:

# Typical Project Ranges

* **Basic WordPress websites** ($1,500-$5,000): Brochure-style sites with standard functionality, suitable for service businesses or professional practices.
* **Mid-range business websites** ($5,000-$15,000): More complex sites with custom functionality, content management systems, and advanced design elements.
* **E-commerce websites** ($7,500-$20,

This project is considered a hypothesis and was yet not approved by official sources. Until workers and authorities are able to improve the standards of budget cost, moving houses to new communities, and facing several challenges, the project can be approved at anytime and the mall will start construction in the future. Roads and streets that are in the Delmarva Mall project will be demolished or moved to avoid obstruction.

Just like the Kalahari Resorts and Great Wolf Lodge, this hotel can be purchased on day passes for unregistered guests to visit the water park.

Have you ever woken up and felt the gentle embrace of a day unfolding with grace? It's a magical feeling, isn't it? The idea of enjoying the day and letting it flow with grace is more than just a pleasant notion—it's a philosophy, a way of approaching life that can transform how we experience each moment.

Imagine this: you wake up in the morning, not rushed or anxious about what's ahead, but simply present. Maybe the sun is peeking through your curtains, casting a warm glow on your room. You take a deep breath, inhaling the freshness of a new day, and you feel a sense of peace settling within you. This is where it begins—this acceptance of the day as it comes, without resistance or expectation.

For me, learning to let the day flow with grace has been a journey of mindfulness and appreciation. It's about finding beauty in the smallest of things: the laughter of children playing outside my kindergarten classroom, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or the soothing rhythm of rain tapping against my window. These moments, when savored and embraced, become anchors of peace in a busy world.

But embracing the day doesn't mean avoiding challenges or setbacks. Life is a blend of sunny mornings and stormy afternoons. It's in these moments of challenge that the philosophy of grace truly shines. It's about navigating difficulties with resilience and compassion, understanding that every experience—pleasant or challenging—is an opportunity for growth and learning.

Think about how you approach your daily interactions and tasks. When we approach them with grace—being kind to ourselves and others, maintaining patience even when things don't go as planned—we create a ripple effect of positivity. It's like dropping a pebble into a pond; the effects of our gracefulness spread outward, touching lives in ways we may never fully realize.

Moreover, enjoying the day and letting it flow with grace isn't just a personal philosophy; it can also be a communal practice. When we cultivate an atmosphere of grace in our relationships and communities, we foster understanding and harmony. We become agents of peace, contributing to a collective sense of well-being and connection.

In essence, embracing each day with grace is about mindfulness, resilience, and cultivating a positive outlook. It's about finding joy in the present moment and appreciating the richness of life's experiences. So, the next time you wake up to a new day, remember: embrace it, enjoy it, and let it flow with grace.

## What is Tradenex Maven?

Tradenex Maven is an **automated trading platform** designed to make trading accessible for people who don’t want to spend hours analyzing markets. Think of it as a smart assistant that does the heavy lifting — it scans the market, finds potential trades, and executes them based on pre-set algorithms.

The platform is geared towards **cryptocurrency** and **forex trading**, but it also supports other popular markets like stocks and commodities. It uses automation to help users take advantage of market opportunities in real-time, even if they’re asleep or busy with day jobs.

In short, it's a tool that combines **AI-driven tech** with a clean user interface to help you trade smarter, not harder.

## Who Created Tradenex Maven?

Tradenex Maven doesn’t make a big fuss about who’s behind it, which is kind of annoying, but also common with platforms like this. It’s likely developed by a group of fintech professionals or trading enthusiasts who’ve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of transparency on the founders might raise an eyebrow, it's not necessarily a red flag. Many trading platforms choose to focus on the product rather than the personalities behind it. That said, I’d love to see more public-facing info in the future to build more trust.

## How Does Tradenex Maven Work?

At its core, Tradenex Maven works using **automated trading algorithms**. These algorithms constantly scan the market to identify potential buy or sell opportunities based on real-time data.

Here’s a basic breakdown of how it works:

- You sign up and fund your account.
- The system gives you access to a dashboard where you can customize settings.
- Tradenex Maven then begins analyzing market trends and executing trades on your behalf.
- You can either let it run fully automated or choose to intervene manually.

It’s designed to minimize emotional trading and take advantage of market volatility — which is perfect for crypto markets that move 24/7.

## Tradenex Maven Pros and Cons

Like any platform, there’s a mix of good and not-so-good. Here’s a quick breakdown:

**Pros:**
- **Beginner-friendly** interface with easy setup.
- **Automated trading** removes emotional decision-making.
- **Supports multiple assets** like crypto, forex, and stocks.
- **Customizable strategies** for more experienced users.
- **Demo account** for testing before going live.

**Cons:**
- **Lack of transparency** about creators.
- **No native mobile app** (though mobile web works fine).
- **Minimum deposit of $250** might be steep for some beginners.
- **Some risk involved** — automation doesn’t guarantee profits.

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, especially if you know your risk tolerance.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Tradenex Maven?

Tradenex Maven is web-based, which means you can access it on pretty much any device with a browser. I tested it on:

- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome and Firefox) – smooth performance.
- **Smartphones** – works well on Safari and Chrome mobile.
- **Tablets** – no issues there either.

While there’s no dedicated mobile app yet, the **responsive design** makes it easy to trade on the go. Just bookmark the site and you’re good.

## Tradenex Maven – Supported Countries

Tradenex Maven is available in most regions, including:

- United States
- Canada
- Australia
- United Kingdom
- Most of Europe
- South Africa
- Southeast Asia

However, it’s **not available** in a few **restricted countries** like North Korea and some parts of the Middle East due to regulatory reasons. If you’re unsure, just try signing up — it’ll tell you if your country is supported.

## Tradenex Maven – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Tradenex Maven shines. The platform uses **AI-driven algorithms** to process massive amounts of market data in real-time. That means it can **spot trading opportunities way faster** than the average human.

The data is refreshed constantly, and the bot adapts its strategy based on current market movements — which is crucial in fast-moving markets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and **not overloaded with charts or jargon**. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone who’s used other trading tools, you’ll find your way around quickly.

I appreciated the simple layout — no unnecessary tabs, just straightforward buttons and sliders to tweak your strategy.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no official app, Tradenex Maven is fully optimized for mobile. I tested it on both Android and iPhone, and it worked fine. You can **check your stats, update settings, or pause trading** while waiting for your coffee.

It feels like having a pocket-sized trading assistant.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **alerts for price changes, trade actions, or account performance**. If you don’t want the bot to go full-auto, you can use it as a signal tool and act manually when you get notified.

Great for control freaks (like me) who still want a bit of automation.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Tradenex Maven isn’t just for crypto. You can trade **forex, commodities, and even stocks**, depending on your preferences. That’s a big plus if you want to diversify or try out different markets without switching platforms.

## Is Tradenex Maven a Scam?

From what I’ve seen and tested, **Tradenex Maven is not a scam**. It functions as advertised, the dashboard is responsive, and the trades actually execute.

But let’s be real — **all trading carries risk**, especially when automation is involved. The platform isn’t a magic money printer. You still need to manage your strategy and understand what you’re getting into.

The key green flags:

- SSL secure website
- Verified brokers
- Transparent pricing (no weird upsells)
- Responsive customer support

Just remember to **start small**, use the demo account, and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Tradenex Maven?

The minimum deposit to start trading on Tradenex Maven is **$250**. This is fairly standard across similar platforms.

That $250 goes straight into your trading account — it’s not a fee. You can use it to test the waters with the bot or explore manual trading if that’s more your style.

### Tradenex Maven Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** through email and live chat. I tested the live chat at around 11 PM my time and got a response within 5 minutes, which was a nice surprise.

They also provide a **help center** with FAQs and basic guides. While it’s not the most detailed knowledge hub, it’s enough to get you started.

## How do you start trading on Tradenex Maven?

Starting on Tradenex Maven is super straightforward. Here’s what the process looks like:

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Tradenex Maven site and fill out a short form — name, email, phone number. Once you submit, you’ll get redirected to your dashboard.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff). After that, you can deposit your initial $250 using:

- Credit/debit card
- Bank transfer
- Crypto wallet (BTC/ETH)

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either:

- Use the **demo account** to practice.
- Set your **trading preferences** and go live.
- Monitor performance and tweak strategies as needed.

Easy peasy.

## How to Delete a Tradenex Maven Account?

1. Contact their support team via email or live chat.
2. Request account closure.
3. Withdraw any remaining funds before deletion.

They’ll process it within a couple of days. No shady roadblocks.

***Talia, domestic human***

*December 3rd, Earth year 2103*

Sprinting away from animal control for as long as my tired legs would allow, I continued in the direction indicated by my benefactor’s device. My left wrist throbbed with intense pain only dampened by the cocktail of adrenaline and sheer willpower coursing through my veins. I had awoken less than an hour before, and already I felt like collapsing once again. 

My whole body trembled with exertion as I turned yet another corner, praying to gods I didn’t believe in that nobody was waiting for me up ahead. With one wrist dislocated, I had to make an agonizing decision to pocket the gun so that I could access my ally’s directions at the cost of going unarmed. Sweat dripping down my brow threatened to blind me as for a moment I collapsed against the comfortingly-cold metal body of a dumpster, momentarily setting down the device to nurse my injured hand. 

Suddenly, the screen displaying my destination lit up with a message. *“Don’t stop now!”* It demanded. *“You’re just three blocks away. I won’t be able to disrupt the satellite system for much longer.”*

Searching within myself for just a few more droplets of strength, I struggled to my feet and all-but-limped the final few blocks. Out in the open streets, xeno citizens were going about their lives, blissfully free of the pain and fear that dominated my mind.

The warehouse marked as my destination looked on the outside like it hadn’t been used in years. Its corrugated walls, streaked with rust, presented a mosaic of decay and abandonment. Once-vibrant paint peeled away in long, curling strips that partially obscured the alien glyphs marking its loading bay. Weeds pushed through cracks in the surrounding pavement in quiet defiance of the industrial relic. To me, however, it may as well have been a palace made of gold.

Hope renewed a sliver of my strength as I dashed forth and wrapped the fingers of my still-functional hand around the rusty back door’s handle, beaming with joy as it gave way with a light yank. Stepping into the warehouse’s almost pitch-darkness, I sighed with pleasure as the cold air inside kissed my sweat-slicked skin, distracting me for a few blissful moments from the last day’s nightmarish occurrences. With the door closed behind me, I saw a thin strip of bluish light reaching out to me from a cracked door.

Hesitance tempered my every step as I crept toward the light and peered into the sizable room illuminated by it. Judging by its dust-caked desks and long out of date computers, this was a reception area of some sort. A television screen hooked up to the wall fizzled with silent static as it overlooked a low-set coffee table bearing five vials of a silvery liquid.

*“Congratulations, Talia!”* The television beamed, startling me as I dropped my device and fumbled desperately for Prochur’s gun. *“There’s no need for that…”* it continued as the static cleared to reveal a geometric pattern that moved as it spoke. *“I’m the one who’s been guiding you this whole time.”*

Picking up the device I’d dropped onto the ground, I took a moment to confirm this. *“R U talking 2 me thru TV rite now?”*

In response, a single word popped up on screen. *“Yes.”*

Relief flooded my mind as I took a moment to recollect myself before looking up at the television and speaking up. “Why aren’t you here in person?” I asked, refusing to let my guard down just yet. 

*“That is complicated,”* replied the television, its response not exactly as comforting as I had hoped. *“For now, we need to get your tracker disabled.”*

“And how exactly are we going to do that? I don’t see doctors or surgery bays around here.”

Behind me, one of the old computer screens lit up with a notification, partially illuminating an old filing cabinet. *“The key to the cabinet is under that computer’s keyboard. Use it to unlock the second cabinet drawer from the top.”* Instructed my benefactor, remaining deliberately enigmatic.

With no choice but to obey, I carefully crept over to the computer and lifted its keyboard to reveal a simple, unassuming key. Then, with only slight hesitation, I slotted it into the second cabinet from the top and opened it up to look inside. “Is this…” I picked up the strange chrome device shaped almost like a staple gun. It reminded me of something my vet would use. “Is this an auto-syringe?”

*“Correct,”* replied the television as the geometric icon was replaced by a simple diagram on how to insert a vial into this device. *“Now: you see those vials on the coffee table? Grab one and load it into the syringe, then inject it into your neck.”*

“In my neck?” I repeated incredulously, eyeing the screen with newfound suspicion. “Why would I do that?”

*“It is the most efficient path to your subcutaneous implant. You have approximately thirty minutes until the satellite link is restored and this location is compromised.”* Continued my benefactor, their tone a curious mix of casual and robotic.

Picking up the auto-syringe with my good hand, I cautiously approached the table and set it down there before picking up one of the vials and surveying it. “I'm sorry, but I can’t inject this stuff unless you tell me what it is!”

For the first time since I’d come into contact with my benefactor, they actually took a moment to respond. *“The vial you are holding contains a population of programmable medical nanites. Once you inject them, they will rapidly bypass the blood-brain barrier and I will be able to use them to disable your tracker.”*

Eyeing the small glass vessel of silvery liquid, I felt a lump forming in my throat. Horrific as the procedure Prochur would force me to undergo was, at least I knew what its result would be. This vial, however, presented an unknown quantity. My escape up to this point had been painful and terrifying, but at least then I wielded some sliver of self-determination. Even if these really were nanites, what they would do to me was entirely up to the one controlling them. Now, once again, I was placing my fate in the hands of another.

*Is this how I die?* I wondered, awkwardly loading the auto-syringe and holding it to the side of my neck. If this was a sedative, I’d be at the mercy of my ‘benefactor’. If it was poison, I’d be dead in minutes. My finger quivered as I began to tighten it around the trigger, fighting my self-preservation instincts for every millimeter of movement.

I didn’t feel the needle go in. There was a puff of air, and after a few seconds of nothing else, I took the syringe off of my neck and felt a droplet of blood trickling down from where I had held it. “There…” I sighed, slapping the instrument down onto the coffee table before looking back up at the television screen. “I injected it… What now?”

*“Take a seat and try to relax,”* answered the television in a command I was more than happy to follow, collapsing onto a nearby chair with a sigh of mild relief. *“We are still waiting on someone.”*

Hearing this, I felt a lump of anxiety forming in my throat, momentarily rendering me as speechless as Prochur’s implant had. “Who else is coming?” I asked, trying and failing to conceal my mounting concern. 

*“You are not the only runaway I sought to enlist,”* replied my enigmatic ally, pulling up a series of images on the television screen depicting my face alongside those of four other humans, each one accompanied by basic information regarding them. *“Each vile on that table was intended for one of these runaways…”* Following this explanation, three of the profiles faded away, leaving behind only mine and one other. *“Unfortunately, three of my selections have already been recaptured. That leaves just you and Enzo—who is currently two blocks away from our position.”*

The profile beside my own was of a young man roughly my own age. Judging by the sterile white background that matched mine, his picture had also come from a veterinary clinic. Behind locks of wavy blonde hair, Enzo’s eyes like pools of chocolate pierced through the screen as though he was staring right at me. 

Shaking off the bizarre sensation crawling up my spine, I held my damaged wrist in my hand and momentarily attempted to correct it, stopping almost immediately as agonizing pain lanced up my arm in reply. *“Do not attempt that,”* the screen crackled. *“You will not be able to reset your wrist without assistance from another sapient. Once Enzo arrives, he will assist you in correcting the injury.”*

“You never told me your name…” I interrupted, looking upon the geometric pattern with something between curiosity and suspicion. “Now would be a good time.”

*“My name is… Difficult for most sapients to pronounce,”* continued my benefactor, their geometric avatar shifting and pulsating as though lost in thought. *“You may call me ‘Dovetail’.”*

Given the secretive nature of my benefactor up to this point, a nickname seemed like the closest thing to an actual answer I was going to get, so I decided not to push the issue. Reaching into my froggy-face backpack, I retrieved my water bottle and a handful of jerky, eating just enough so that my stomach would stop growling at me.

In the next room over, I heard the same rusty door I had come in through opening once more. “Hello?” A voice called out in English, the sound of their footsteps echoing across the floor towards me.

“In here,” I practically whispered, just barely loud enough for the fellow runaway to hear. For a moment, the footsteps ceased; then, they sped up.

Watching as Enzo walked in, I felt a sudden surge of self-consciousness wash over me. I didn’t get to interact with other humans often, and peering into the dark television screen at my reflection, the girl staring back at me seemed like she’d make a poor first impression. Her hair mussed by recent sleep combined with clothes that assuredly smelled of sweat created an aesthetic less of ‘badass rebel’ and more ‘scraggly goblin’.

*“Welcome, Enzo!”* Chimed Dovetail, their robotic tone tinted with satisfaction. Though not as pristine as he appeared on his profile, Enzo’s escape had clearly gone much smoother than mine judging by his relatively clean clothes and lack of visible injuries. *“Congratulations on making it here! You are one of two to have successfully reached this place.”*

“I, uh… I see that,” Enzo panted, regarding me with a bizarre mixture of pity and suspicion. “What’s your name?” He asked, keeping an arm’s length away from me as he circled the coffee table and took a seat on its other side.

Raising the water bottle to my lips and taking a long swig, I noticed a flicker of longing appear in the other stray’s eyes. The vessel I’d been drinking from only had a few gulps left, and I had planned to savor them. Empathy, however, prevailed as I held out the bottle to Enzo. “My name’s Talia,” I smiled, trying not to let him see how much it hurt me to give up the rest of my supply. “Looks like we’re the only two who made it.”

*“Enzo: on the table in front of you are four vials of nanites. Please use the auto-syringe to inject one of said vials,”* commanded Dovetail just as the other stray finished draining what was left of our water. For a moment, he seemed hesitant, but a reminder from our benefactor of the tracking device broadcasting our location was sufficient motivation. 

Loading the nanite vial with clinical precision, Enzo held it to his neck and without further delay pressed down on the trigger, eliciting another puff of air from the syringe as it pumped the liquid into him. With that done, the human turned his gaze toward me. “Holy shit: your wrist!” He half-gasped, reaching out for my arm only to stop short of grabbing it. “What happened?”

“I… Might have tried to fire a Jakuvian-grade pistol one-handed,” I sighed, deciding it best to simplify my explanation. “Dovetail says you can help me reset it.”

“Oh, that’s easy,” replied the stray, gently wrapping his hand around my limp wrist. “You’ll wanna bite down on something: this is gonna hurt like a bitch.” 

Taking his advice, I placed one of the straps of my backpack between my teeth and clamped down hard onto it. “On the count of three, okay Talia? One… Two—” he didn’t wait for ‘three’ before yanking the bone back into its original position with a sickening *crrrack* accompanied by a roaring agony worse than what I’d felt incurring the injury. I wanted to cry out, to scream, to swear, but we couldn’t risk anyone outside hearing it. Instead, I remained silent as the pain slowly but surely faded to a manageable level. 

*“Excellent!”* Dovetail chimed in, their voice partially muddled by the pain I was in. *“Your nanites will take care of the rest.”*

“So your name is Dovetail?” Enzo asked, looking at our benefactor with a curious expression. “Not to sound ungrateful, but I have some questions regarding whatever the hell is happening here. For one thing, what’s the plan? I’m guessing you wanna try and sway the Council. The vote for Human independence was decently close—maybe we can get them to reconvene on it?”

*“Unfortunately, I do not believe that is an option…”* Answered Dovetail with an enigmatic lilt. *“You see, the Council’s vote was not merely on whether they should deem Humanity sapient—it was a vote to change the definition of sapience itself so that Humans could be included under it.”*

Oddly pedantic as it was, Dovetail’s explanation gave no clear reason as to why a recount was out of the question. “Even still…” I replied, picking up where Enzo left off. “The vote *was* close. If we can get them to recount, maybe things might go different.”

*“The vote they showed the public was close…”* our benefactor replied, their geometric avatar onscreen replaced by a pie chart representing the Council’s votes. *“Sixty in favor, seventy-nine opposed, and three abstaining. However, when I accessed the voting database with ‘borrowed’ Council privileges, the vote looked something like this—”* Immediately, the chart began to shift as the red ‘opposed’ section seemed to swallow up the blue ‘in favor’ one. *“Eight in favor, seven abstaining, one hundred and twenty seven opposed.”*",79,1744770369.0,HFY,14,1.0,False

1k09pkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1k09pkw/im_ready_to_finish_it/,I'm ready to finish it,"I started watching twin peaks in 2016 and I instantly fell in love. This is a story unlike any other. I love how it is so over-the-top silly, surreal in it's symbolism, cozy in a small town kind of way, and a dichotomy of tenderness and brutality. I quickly went through the first and second season while I was with my college girlfriend. We watched the movie together and it just blew my mind. Shortly after, they announced the release of season 3. I couldn't believe it. I counted the days for the release and when the time finally came, I didn't watch it. I couldn't watch it. I was scared. I thought to myself, ""If I finish this show, it will actually be the end."" 

I watched the show again in 2021 and I finished the movie. Once again, I couldn't bring myself to watch the 3rd season. Ive done this in different ways throughout my life. One of my all time favorite shows is  Parts Unknown with Anthony Bourdain. I had watched all the episodes. But when I landed on the last season, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Bourdain and Lynch are no longer on this plane and this would truly be the end. I find comfort in knowing that there are still episodes both for Twin Peaks and Parts Unknown that are still untouched, waiting for a random Tuesday night for me to gently take in an episode I have yet to see.

At times I feel silly thinking this way over tv shows. But truthfully I dont get like this for other shows. I can finish them just fine. I think the difference is that people like Lynch and Bourdain are people that I respected so much on their own regarding their life philosophy outside of tv. 

I don't have a traumatic history with grief,  just a complicated relationship to it. I felt this in past relationships where I have struggled to let go. The idea of the end is unsettling and a part of me can't comprehend it. I know I'll be fine, I know that part of it is just a matter of getting through it. Still, I struggle. 

But I don't want to keep feeling like this. Part of getting better with this is to recognize that I'll get better at it by simply doing it. I recently finished season 1, 2 and FWWM and I've decided that I want to invite my friend over to watch the last season together. He loves the show so much so it would feel appropriate to finish it with him. I may even swing by Bob's Big Boy and get a slice of cherry pie and black coffee. It feels more right this time and I'd feel happy to finally be in the same level of confusion as everyone else after I've watched season 3 lol.

1k09oz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitCrewNicotine/comments/1k09oz6/the_most_common_quitting_mistakes/,The most common quitting mistakes,"Quitting nicotine is one of the hardest things you can do, and most people make it even harder on themselves without realizing it. If you've tried to quit and slipped up, or if you're planning to quit and want to be prepared, this is for you.

These are the mistakes I see over and over. Avoiding them won’t make quitting easy, but it will make it possible.

**1. Telling yourself “just one won’t hurt”**  
This is the biggest trap. That one turns into a full relapse faster than you think. If you're quitting, you have to go all in. No exceptions, no gray areas.

**2. Not having a real plan**  
Deciding to quit is great, but if you don't have a strategy, you're relying on willpower alone. And willpower runs out. Know your quit date, know what your triggers are, and have a plan for what to do when cravings hit.

**3. Thinking motivation will carry you**  
Motivation comes and goes. Some days you'll feel fired up, but other days you'll want to cave. That's normal. Quitting requires structure, not just good intentions. Routine, accountability, and backup strategies are what keep you going when the motivation disappears.

**4. Keeping your routine exactly the same**  
If you always smoked or vaped during certain parts of your day, like your morning coffee, after meals, or when driving, those triggers will hit hard. If you don’t change your routine, you’ll keep walking right into cravings. Even small changes help. Switch your drink, take a different route, change your schedule slightly.

**5. Not preparing for withdrawal**  
If you're surprised by how bad withdrawal feels, you're more likely to relapse just to make it stop. It's not a sign that you're weak. It's literally your brain and body adjusting to life without nicotine. Expect the headaches, brain fog, irritability. Know that it passes. You’re not broken, you’re healing.

**6. Trying to do it alone**  
Some people think they can white knuckle it by themselves. It usually doesn’t work. You need people around you who understand what you’re going through. Having others in your corner makes a huge difference.

**7. Thinking a relapse means you failed**  
People mess up. It happens. But a relapse doesn't have to mean you're back at square one. The real mistake is giving up completely after a slip. The faster you get back on track, the more likely you are to stay quit for good. Learn from it and move forward.

1k09ncr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k09ncr/the_hierarchy_of_employment_and_how_ai_affects/,The hierarchy of employment and how AI affects your job,"**tldr;** my 2¢ on how to think about AI with respect to job security - own projects, not tasks

**Background:** I'm a senior software engineer with 7 years of experience, including fintech, big tech, and early-stage startups. I'm currently bootstrapping a lifestyle-sized small software product for SMBs. 

**Point of this post:** I'm giving my two cents about how to think of your career in software and whether it is at risk from AI.

**Part 1: the hierarchy of employment**

I think of all jobs, including in software, as falling into three categories:

1. Task-oriented: your day-to-day revolves around completing tasks assigned to you. If you're working at a cafe, that might mean ""clean the tables"" or ""make coffee."" If you're a SWE, that might mean ""change the button color palette from blues to purples according to the design system."" Being good at this means you're known for clearing Jira queues quickly and nobody has to clean up after you or redo work you said you did.
2. Project-oriented: you're given projects to complete but the details and methods are up to you. If you're working at a cafe, it could be ""make sure the pastries are refreshed every two hours."" If you're a software engineer, it could be ""implement the new design system."" Being good at this means you can be trusted to deliver a feature that may have multiple ways of completing it while balancing trade-offs, on time. This often requires delegation. I'm at this level right now.
3. Outcome-oriented: you own an outcome. That's often quantified in terms of money or a money-adjacent metric. If you're at a cafe, it can be increasing the number of baked goods sold with coffee orders. If you're in software (you may not be actively coding at this level), it may be ""increase conversions from large enterprise clients on the landing page."" Being good at this means being known as someone who can make products grow revenue and/or profit. I'm upgrading to this level by bootstrapping a business - even if I fail, I will have owned an outcome.

In both coffee and software examples, notice that these are different roles on the same project. Notice also that I focus on ""being known as,"" which is the most important thing in career stability and progression.

Almost everyone typically starts on level 1. It's unusual and incredibly risky to stay at level 1, and you have to be constantly adapting and learning new technologies to pull it off. You want to graduate to level 2 as soon as possible**,** ideally within 2 years. Few people make it to level 3, it's normally OK to stay at level 2. Level 2 makes more than level 1 within the same company/skillset (of course a PM at Walmart might make less than an AI engineer at OpenAI). Level 3 has unbounded pay. 

**How to move levels**

I am by no means a great authority on getting promoted, I tend to get distracted and chase my own goals. But from talking to people who are good at it, there are two things you need to do:

1. Be really good at your current job band: if you're level 1, your manager knows that when they give you a task, it will be done when you say it will be done, it will be done to the highest reasonable standards, and nobody is going to have to clean up after you.
2. Know your manager's goals and align your work to them. Find ways to make them look better and achieve their goals. Show you care.

Of course, there are more cynical factors, like being liked and having a good attitude. Finally, your self-conception is important. If you think of yourself as ""a guy who makes Spring Boot apps"" you'll be stuck in level 1 longer than if you think of yourself as ""a guy who delivers backend services."" PG has a great essay about keeping your self-characterization loose but I can't find it right now.

  
**Part 2: What AI means for you**

AI is decently good at doing a lot of level 1 work. If you counted on being the gatekeeper of button colors as the reason for why you can't be fired, that's not going to work anymore. In fact, if you counted on being the gatekeeper of anything, that's unlikely to keep working. 

That being said, level 1 is always risky. If you were a really good JQuery developer who could complete any task in that language, the rise of frameworks like React threatened your job. Not right away as your company might need you for their existing code, but the reduced demand for JQuery devs would lessen your bargaining power and the increased support and flood of React developers would make switching stacks increasingly attractive to your employer. Any major technology shift is a threat to level 1 operators.

The difference with AI, however, is that it's happening across all technologies at once. The goal is what's being automated, not just the method. AI can write basic software in any language. You can't switch from owning button colors in JQuery to owning button colors in React or whatever the next tech is, you have to upgrade what you can deliver.

There are tasks that AI can't do because it's not smart enough. If you're a staff engineer working on very complex problems you might be fine, but if you're part of the 90% that do various versions of the same thing that everyone else does, your job is at risk once the Devins of the world nail their product and user experience.

The good news is that it's also a resource that you can use:

1. If you're currently task-oriented, use AI to be really good at completing tasks fast and well. Do this by focusing on the ""well."" AI is already really fast compared to you, so don't try to go faster. Plan first, think what kind of testing you need, both automated and manual, and what the deployment story will look like
2. Now that you know the hierarchy of employment, focus on graduating to the next band by understanding the context in which you're given tasks, talking to your lead, and making their project happen faster and better

**Why AI is not a threat to bands 2 and 3**

Owning a project requires taste. AI doesn't have taste yet, and I doubt it will develop it. The main difference between owning tasks and owning a project is thinking through tradeoffs, understanding how this project fits and what its goals are, and making a plan that aligns the tradeoffs with the goals. AI can be very helpful as an assistant in doing this, but it requires the person doing it to already know what the options are and what the goals are. This is not the case for basic feature development.

Level 3 is safe first because it's the decision makers who aren't going to fire themselves, and second because it requires even more intuition and experience than AI has access to. More importantly, it requires accountability, which is one of the main barriers to using AI.",18,1744770030.0,cscareerquestions,3,0.88,False

ACT I: THE REQUIEM

EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

A storm churns violently overhead. Crimson lightning arcs across the clouds. The mountain groans—loud, alive, almost in pain.

INT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - THRESHOLD CHAMBER - NIGHT

CLOSE ON - STONE WALLS

Hairline fractures snake across the glyph-covered walls. The ancient rock groans, crumbles.

SFX: A low, growing RUMBLE builds into a metallic wail.

Chunks of stone begin to FALL.

CUT TO - WANDA MAXIMOFF

She stands alone at the center, dust in her hair, eyes red-rimmed—not from power, from fear.

Her breath is shallow. Rapid.

She looks up—

CRACK—another slab crashes down behind her.

CLOSE ON - HER HANDS

They lift, instinctively. Not casting. Not summoning.

Just shielding. 

A human reflex.

WIDE SHOT - THE CHAMBER

The ceiling gives. Stone crashes downward.

Wanda—no longer glowing, no longer godlike—curls inward.

She doesn’t run.

She doesn’t fight.

She just braces.

CUT TO - EXT. MOUNT WUNDAGORE - NIGHT

From the outside, the mountain’s peak implodes inward—a violent collapse. Dust clouds mushroom outward.

SILENCE.

Then—

A SCREAM.

SFX: A high-pitched, wraith-like SHRIEK—layered with a very real, very human scream.

It doesn’t come from Wanda’s mouth. 

It comes from the impact point.

WIDE - THE MOUNTAIN’S FACE

RED AND BLACK MAGIC blasts out in opposite directions—violent, unnatural, like energy being rejected by the earth.

The sound is unbearable. It shreds the silence, echoes through the valley.

Then—

STILLNESS.

Only dust now.

Only ruin.

CLOSE ON - THE COLLAPSE SITE

A single tendril of smoke-red energy flickers briefly from beneath the rubble.

It quivers.

Then slithers back under.

BLACK SCREEN.

FAINT SFX:

A breath. Small. Sharp. Not Wanda’s.

New.

FADE OUT.

TEXT ON SCREEN: “Six Months Later.”

SFX: Faint echoes—newscasters overlapping, distorted.

“Where is she?”

“…no sign of the body…”

“…no official Avengers roster since—”

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM – DAY

A civics teacher stands in front of a flickering screen. The slide reads:

""THE SOKOVIA ACCORDS: REPEALED OR REWRITTEN?""

Students barely pay attention. One slouches with earbuds in. Another scrolls her phone.

STUDENT

So... like... what happens if someone with laser eyes

blows up a building now?

TEACHER

The Global Repatriation Council is working on updated legislation.

A pause.

STUDENT #2

What happened to the Avengers?

The teacher falters.

The screen shifts to a faded image of the original team. Static ripples across their faces.

FLASHBACK - AVENGERS COMPOUND

INT. VISION’S ROOM – NIGHT

The room is quiet. Too quiet.

Only the soft pacing of Vision—gliding across the floor in deliberate steps.

Hands clasped behind his back. Posture perfect.

But his shoulders are tight. His jaw clenched.

The synthetic jewel in his forehead flickers—nervous energy.

A single screen floats beside him.

Equations shift and reconfigure: quantum loop theories, entropy paradoxes.

He stares, but his eyes are somewhere else.

VISION

“If particle spin could destabilize probability long enough to recalibrate phase transitions, perhaps—”

He stops.

Mid-thought.

Her face flashes behind his eyes.

⸻

FLASH – WANDA LAUGHING

Bathed in golden kitchen light.

Hair falling across her eyes—she brushes it back.

An oversized sweater slips off her shoulder.

Vision swallows.

⸻

He turns away sharply, like he can physically outrun the memory.

The screen reshapes—layering on another theory.

More complexity. More noise.

But the thoughts keep coming.

Wanda, leaning over the sink.

Her sleeves rolled up.

The sound of her voice saying his name in that unguarded, low tone.

The thought of—

kissing her.

⸻

He closes his eyes.

Inhales.

VISION

“It is illogical. It is… intrusive. It is—”

He stops again.

His hand drifts to his chest.

Where a heartbeat should live.

He doesn’t understand it. Not fully.

But when he thinks of her…

There’s a pull.

A heat.

A yearning.

Something beyond data.

Beyond circuitry.

Something human.

⸻

He sits on the edge of his bed.

Still. Silent.

The glow of unsolved equations flickers beside him.

But all he can see is the way Wanda looked at him earlier—

Not like Jarvis.

Not like a weapon.

Not like a machine.

But like a man.

Like he was seen.

⸻

VISION

“I wish to comfort her.

To understand her pain.

But I also…

I wish to hold her.”

He opens his eyes—soft, wide, almost afraid.

VISION

“I wish… to be held in return.”

The screen fades to black.

He lets it.

Because tonight, no equation will soothe the ache in his chest.

Only she could do that.

And maybe tomorrow—

He’ll try.

He’ll make her chicken paprikash.

But tonight—

He sits in the quiet.

Longing for a girl with chaos in her bones,

and kindness in her smile.

⸻

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND – COMMON ROOM – NIGHT

Soft light flickers from the screen—blues and grays washing over the room.

WANDA is curled up on the couch. Blanket cocoon. Eyes glassy—not from the movie.

The Notebook plays softly. Rain. Kissing. Heartbreak.

Background noise to the storm she’s holding in.

A gentle knock on the doorframe.

She looks up.

VISION stands there.

Arms at his sides. Slightly awkward. Almost… shy.

VISION

“Forgive the interruption. I… found Euler’s conjecture unexpectedly complex tonight. I wondered if you—”

(beat)

“—might like some company.”

Wanda blinks.

Euler’s conjecture?

Her heart does something it shouldn’t.

She pats the cushion beside her.

WANDA

“Sure. Unless you’re worried Ryan Gosling’s emotional arc will prove equally… complex.”

A soft hum escapes Vision. Not quite a laugh.

More like relieved amusement.

He enters.

Pauses.

Looks at her.

Looks at the couch.

Then—sits.

Tentative. Upright. Respectful.

Like she’s royalty.

Wanda shifts. Tries to refocus on the movie.

Fails.

Her pulse is loud.

⸻

A beat later—

NATASHA walks past the open door. Stops.

She glances at the two of them—too close to be casual, too stiff to be comfortable.

Raises an eyebrow.

NATASHA

(dry)

“Huh.”

She smirks. Walks away.

Wanda stifles a laugh.

Vision stares forward like the screen might swallow him.

⸻

Time passes.

Scene after scene—they drift.

Inch by inch.

Shoulders almost touch. Then—

They do.

Wanda leans in, barely.

She feels him. Warm.

Too warm for synthetic parts.

WANDA

“You must be freezing.”

(beat)

“Come on… share the blanket.”

Vision looks at the blanket like it’s radioactive.

VISION

“I… am not certain I can feel cold in the traditional sense, but—”

WANDA

(teasing)

“But?”

He looks at her.

Really looks.

Her smile.

Her eyes.

The way her voice softens when she’s teasing him.

He swallows.

(Why? He doesn’t need to. But something in his design mimics the human response to overwhelming emotion.)

VISION

(softly)

“Perhaps… I could benefit from a degree of warmth.”

He pulls the blanket over them.

Their shoulders touch.

Then thighs.

Then—

nothing else exists.

⸻

He catches the scent of her hair.

She glances at his lips.

Both aching.

Neither ready.

But closer now.

Always closer.

⸻The movie hits that scene.

Rain. Desperation. The lovers collide—devouring each other.

Suddenly—

Wanda and Vision aren’t watching the movie.

The movie is watching them.

⸻

She leans against him now.

Head on his shoulder. Body relaxed.

But her breathing?

Shallow.

Fast.

Rising.

Her neckline shifts under the blanket.

Her skin, pink and glowing in the light.

Vision doesn’t turn his head.

But he knows.

He shifts in his seat.

Reaches for a nearby pillow.

Quick. Strategic.

But not quick enough.

Wanda notices.

⸻

She says nothing.

Just keeps breathing.

Soft. Heavy.

Vision feels each breath like it’s his own.

Sees her collarbone rise and fall.

The flutter in her throat.

The pulse that jumps when his arm brushes hers.

He’s aching.

And for the first time—he doesn’t want it to stop.

⸻

Her fingers graze his knee beneath the blanket.

On-screen—sounds of ecstasy, gasps, skin meeting skin.

In the silence between them—

only tension.

⸻

Vision stares at the screen like a lifeline.

But his processors are failing him.

They stay like that.

No words.

Because the spell might break.

And neither is ready for that.

The movie ends.

Credits roll in soft piano and rain.

The room is silver and shadow.

Still. Electric.

His arm—now behind her on the couch.

Not touching.

But near.

⸻

Wanda blinks slowly.

She’s not watching the screen.

She’s listening—

To the hum in his chest.

To the stillness.

She turns slightly.

Looks up.

He’s already looking at her.

⸻

Their eyes meet.

This time—

Neither looks away.

⸻

WANDA

(soft)

“You stayed.”

VISION

(barely audible)

“I didn’t want to go.”

A beat.

The air, thick. Charged.

Like a wire pulled tight.

⸻

WANDA

(gentle, small smile)

“You never said if the conjecture got any easier.”

VISION

(soft, honest)

“It did not.”

Their eyes lock.WANDA

(smirking)

I sense your mind analyzing me. Go on then. Analyze me.

VISION

(polite, curious)

In what sense?

WANDA

Emotionally. Psychologically. Whatever your circuits do.

(beat)

I can take it.

VISION

Very well.

(beat, straight-faced)

Your breathing is shallow — approximately seventeen breaths per minute.

Heart rate elevated — 112 bpm. Likely due to proximity.

Pupils dilated. Indicating either low light or… heightened— 

WANDA Ok, ok. I think we get it.She laughs playfully. Then suddenly–

Her gaze drops.

To his lips.

His jaw.

Back to his eyes.

She swallows.

He blinks once. Then again.

⸻

VISION

(softly)

“Wanda…”

Her name leaves him like a prayer.

And in that moment—

He doesn’t move.

But something shatters in his expression.

So full of longing.

Fear.

Reverence.

Wanda forgets how to breathe.

⸻

She shifts closer. Slowly.

With purpose.

Her fingers trail down his arm.

Find his hand.

Lace with his.

He looks down.

Like he can’t believe it’s real.

⸻

WANDA

(quiet)

“I don’t know what this is yet.”

VISION

(bare breath)

“Nor do I.”

She leans against him again.

This time—

He leans into her.

Lets his head rest against hers.

Lets his fingers tighten slightly around hers.

And in that hush—

that heartbeat neither of them should have—

they sit.

Not as witch and android.

Not as weapon and machine.

But as two souls choosing the ache.

Choosing the stillness.

Choosing each other.

⸻

EXT. BARTON FAMILY FARM – EARLY MORNING

The world is quiet.

The Barton home glows warm—filled with the smell of breakfast, the sound of laughter.

LILA and COOPER argue playfully at the kitchen table.

LAURA kisses CLINT on the cheek, smiling.

CLINT watches them, coffee in hand.

But… he’s not really there.

FLASH – MEMORY

RONIN stands over a corpse, chest heaving. Blood streaks across his blade.

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint blinks. Hard.

Shakes it off.

LAURA sees it. She knows that look.

LAURA

(gently, knowing)

Hey. Where’d you go?

Clint forces a small smile.

But then—ANOTHER FLASH.

⸻

FLASHBACK – VORMIR

The wind howls.

A violet sky, vast and empty.

NATASHA clings to the cliff’s edge—her hand locked in Clint’s.

Her face is calm. Her voice, firm.

NATASHA

(softly, unwavering)

Let me go.

Clint grips tighter.

A beat. He shakes his head, barely breathing.

CLINT

(a whisper, broken)

I can’t.

Natasha smiles—just a little.

And then… her legs kick off the cliff wall, creating enough force to shake his grip loose.

⸻

BACK TO PRESENT

Clint’s coffee cup trembles in his hand.

He sets it down.

Eyes locked on nothing.

The sound of laughter fades behind him.

Clint stands.

Walks away from the table.

Laura watches him go.

She says nothing.

CUT TO BLACK.

⸻

EXT. FOREST CLEARING – EARLY MORNING

Mist clings to the trees. The earth is still. Somewhere in the woods, a figure stirs.

WANDA lies in the dirt—disoriented, trembling, alive.

Her fingers are blackened, her body weak.

She blinks up at the sky—confused. Empty.

She doesn’t remember who she is.

She doesn’t remember her magic.

She only knows: something inside her is broken.

She pushes herself up.

Staggers to her feet.

Nearby, a shallow river.

She catches her reflection in the water—

But doesn’t recognize it.

Her fingers instinctively twitch.

A faint flicker of red—then nothing.

FLASHES – QUICK CUTS

— A bomb explodes in Sokovia.

— VISION’S lifeless body.

— Screams echo through Kamar-Taj.

— Chaos. Fire. Loss.

BACK TO SCENE

Wanda clutches her head.

She drops to her knees — gasping.She doesn’t understand what’s happening.

She can’t tell her dreams from reality anymore.

SHE’S ALSO NOT ALONE.

## What is Ethereum 2.0 ProAir?

Ethereum 2.0 ProAir is an automated trading platform designed to help everyday users take advantage of crypto market volatility. It uses **advanced algorithms and AI-driven tools** to analyze market conditions, make predictions, and execute trades — all without needing you to be glued to the screen 24/7.

If you're familiar with platforms like Immediate Edge or Bitcoin Era, this is in the same ballpark, but with a sleeker interface and more customization options. The goal is simple: make crypto trading more accessible, less risky (well, relatively), and more efficient for newbies and semi-pros alike.

## Who Created Ethereum 2.0 ProAir?

This is where things get a little murky. Like many crypto trading platforms, **Ethereum 2.0 ProAir doesn’t have a clear founder listed** on its website. It claims to be developed by a team of financial analysts, software engineers, and crypto experts. Classic, right?

That said, this isn’t necessarily a red flag. Many reputable platforms use teams rather than individuals as figureheads. From what I could tell during testing, the software is stable, the customer service is responsive, and the tech under the hood feels professional — not something slapped together overnight.

## How Does Ethereum 2.0 ProAir Work?

In a nutshell, Ethereum 2.0 ProAir uses **AI and machine learning** to scan the market, identify trends, and place trades based on pre-set parameters. You can choose to let the software run in full-auto mode, or you can tweak the settings to match your style — think of it like cruise control vs. manual driving.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- The algorithm analyzes **real-time market data**.
- It predicts potential opportunities based on trends and historical data.
- If the conditions match your chosen strategy, it executes the trade.
- You can monitor everything from your dashboard or app.

It’s kind of like having a robo-trader doing the heavy lifting while you sit back and enjoy your coffee.

## Ethereum 2.0 ProAir Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real — no platform is perfect. But here’s the breakdown of what I liked and what could be better:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Demo account** for learning the ropes.
- ✅ **Real-time insights** with AI support.
- ✅ **Low initial deposit** ($250 is manageable for most users).
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets** beyond crypto.

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app** (yet) — only mobile browser access.
- ❌ **No clear info on founders** — would be nice to have transparency.
- ❌ **High volatility still applies** — automation helps, but doesn’t guarantee profits.

I came to terms with it, then she said she “realized” she missed me in her life and it was rough to hear 

had a really nice talk with a friend who got super busy with life and so did I and we both became distant. It started as her being chronically busy and bailing all the time on plans that I made with her bc she never made plans first. At first I was hurt but I came to terms with it bc shit happens and life happens; no one owes time or explanations. She sent me a cryptic text on my bday after low contact for MONTHS on end and zero effort for a year (hadn’t seen her in over a year even though we live in the same city!). She basically said she “realized” that she misses me in her life ….That didnt sit well with me. I told her thanks for the kind wishes, I hope we can connect soon, however I acknowledged that we had drifted/ it was also on me for not speaking up and stopping reaching out. I mentioned that initally when she was always bailing and busy, i didn’t want to be a bother and be the only one reaching out/responding bc she literally had not texted me in months and months. I was happy to reconnect moving forward if we both could work on better communication and showing up. And I offered to match my time with hers since shes super busy all the time (haha then she said she was never annoyed about it but “realized” again now now nice it was to have someone stay in touch … also kinda not sitting right with me but i want to try to move forward) 

Im thankful she received the conversation and I feel better after it. When moving forward with a friend in a new direction (I need new boundaries, she will probably more a more distant friend now which is fine to me). What should i do and ensure healthy communication and boundaries moving forward? Making sure she also offers plans so it’s not one sided? Meeting for a quick coffee first to feel the waters and schedule something routinely (like lunch once a month) and seeing how it goes? 

Has anyone had a difficult convo with a friend like this and moved forward just fine?
