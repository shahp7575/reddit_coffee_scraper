When we would go out to eat (as friends), he would always pay for our food together. At first, I didn't question it because he would say it was a way of paying me back (I help him with his homework a lot). I thought, cool, free food. But now it's like a reoccurring thing. On Saturday, we went to Philly and got boba from a boba shop. I offered to pay for his drink with mine, but he said no need and pulled out his card, tapping it on the card machine before I could say okay or not. He did it again when we got ramen and I got annoyed.

A little background, he comes from a wealthy family. His family has their own business in construction. He always had a large allowance, and he works for his family sometimes, so they pay him too. I have a weekend job, now as a cashier. I don't make as much as him, but I have enough to treat him out for something. I've tried, but he never accepts it, telling me I should just save my money. He said it's also a waste for me to buy him lunch, since my parents check my receipts and statements anyway.

I just feel really bad. I've kinda stopped ordering drinks or lunches when we go out together. I don't want him to pay for everything. A few of my friends don't think there's anything wrong with it. The rest of my friends think that if I let him keep doing this, I'll be a 'gold digger' or something. Today at school (my school has a student coffee shop) he wanted to buy me some coffee or food there, but I said no. He looked kinda sad when I said that, and now I feel even worse. So half of my friends said I was rude. The other half said he was controlling. 

I appreciate the things he does, but I don't want him to think that I'm taking advantage of him. I always cook and bake for him on a weekly basis, and make him a lot of homemade gifts to show my love and appreciation. And, like I said, I stopped ordering things when we go out (I'm talking like food or drinks). But WIBTA if I let him continue to do this?",2,1744678368.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1jzezov,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jzezov/aio_for_thinking_im_being_used/,AIO for thinking I’m being used?,"My partner and I have been dating for about 5 years. I’ve never had thoughts about being used, or taken advantage of until recently. 

Lately, their income has been suffering from a lack of work (tutoring). It’s hard to find students apparently, and because there’s such good money in it, you’d have to work 2 or 3 times longer if at a retail/coffee shop etc. 

I’ve been paying for everything the past ~6 months. Rent, car insurance, utilities. I don’t mind helping but I’d really like to know that they have a plan to get their income up or if there’s something else I can help with (help send out resumes, look at job boards, etc). 

The red flag for me is every time I ask about it, I receive an answer in a defensive tone:

“of course I’m looking for more work. It’s not an easy thing to do”. 

And kinda storms off as if I’m insinuating they’re not making an effort. 

Second red flag is I see them buying unnecessary kinda expensive stuff. Few hundred dollars there, few hundred dollars here. I know my help is suppose to be unconditional, but it’s hard for me to ignore this when I’m paying $1,500+ to cover them and they get upset when I ask how their job hunt is going. 

Last red flag is unfortunately I haven’t received a single thank you, proactive update on their financial status (I always have to ask first). I’m definitely not feeling the appreciation; it’s almost like if I never said anything it would just continue like this forever. 

I don’t know if my feelings are correct, as our relationship seems ok day to day in other ways. I worry that because I ask how they’re doing, it pushes them away and makes it harder to get back on their feet.

It would be great to just hear “hey, thanks for helping me again this month, I’m really working on getting my income up”.

I don't want to leave as I enjoy my other friends and family's company, but there are a few bad apples in the group that everyone kind of deals with.

There's one man in our group who's an older gentleman, maybe 40's or 50's, I'm in my 20's and he keeps asserting dominance over me. He yells my name and asks me a question that's not his business, I ignore him and he yells it louder at me so I answer. I've yelled back at him, I've tried to ignore him, I fight back and he keeps fighting never backs down ever, he always wins, because I let him win. Whenever someone responds with aggression my instinct is to acquiess to that person to avoid conflict.

I have an uncle who barks orders at me. He's hit me before so I know if I say no he'll hit me again. A few years ago when I was a teen he asked me to give him his coffee like ""Hey! (my name) gimme my coffee!"" and I said ""Not if you ask like that"" and he walked up to me and smacked me upside the head and then said ""(My name)! Don't get smart with me. If I ask you for something, you get it!"" and I gave it to him and now every time he barks an order at me I bend and obey him. He doesn't do this with anyone else except me, no one else, I'm the only man in the group aside from my Dad but he wouldn't dare do that to my Dad as he'd get his teeth knocked out. He asserts dominance on dogs that are in the room to show them he's boss (he barks orders and gets them to do tricks but with no treat to entice them and when they dont listen he lightly kicks them and doesn't stop until they submit to him then he leaves them alone) and any man who he doesn't know visits by he squares up and gets hostile and they in turn get hostile cause of course they're being threatened. Very ""Man's man"" kind of guy, stone faced, cold, aggressive kind of person. I'm getting to a point where I am not going to tolerate this behaviour anymore and I keep my interactions with them to a minimum as I've moved out but I still have them visit from time to time and my family acts like it's not a big deal and are dismissive in the matter and guilt trip me to come. I'm afraid to go to prison for assaulting him next time he walks over to hit me when I inevitably fight back verbally/ignore him, I'm not dealing with this anymore.

I feel scared and angry and want some advice to deal with this when he inevitably tries this with me.

1jzeu5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/1jzeu5i/the_symphony_of_meaning_how_prime_numbers_shape/,The Symphony of Meaning: How Prime Numbers Shape the Dance of Entropy into Coherence,"Imagine a universe where every thought, word, or fleeting sensation is a note in an infinite cosmic melody. These notes don’t wander in isolation - they intertwine, resonate, and sometimes snap into moments of startling clarity, like a melody resolving into a perfect chord. 

My recent research, outlined in a paper titled [Symbolic Entropy and Resonance Collapse: A Prime-Based Formalism for Observer-Centered Information Fields](https://www.academia.edu/128787715/Symbolic_Entropy_and_Resonance_Collapse_A_Prime_Based_Formalism_for_Observer_Centered_Information_Fields), explores this phenomenon, offering a new way to understand how information transforms into meaning. 

Weaving together physics, consciousness, and artificial intelligence, this framework unveils an unexpected conductor: prime numbers, those elemental integers, might orchestrate the emergence of understanding itself.

# Entropy: A Living Canvas for Patterns

Entropy often conjures visions of disorder - a cup of coffee cooling into uniformity, a cluttered room resisting tidiness. In classical physics, entropy measures the multitude of ways a system can configure itself, a tally of microstates behind a macrostate. 

In Claude Shannon’s information theory, it quantifies uncertainty - the unpredictability of the next symbol in a message, like guessing the next word in a sentence.

Yet entropy is more than a synonym for chaos or a static number. My work reimagines it as a dynamic field, a vibrant canvas where observers - human minds, AI systems, or abstract entities - paint patterns of coherence. 

Entropy doesn’t merely sit there; it evolves, twists, and sometimes collapses into moments of insight, like a scattered jigsaw puzzle suddenly revealing its picture. This perspective shifts entropy from a passive metric to an active player in the drama of meaning-making.

Consider a moment of confusion - say, grappling with a complex idea. At first, the concepts feel disjointed, their connections obscure. 

Then, through focus or a spark of intuition, clarity emerges, and the pieces align. 

This transition, from uncertainty to understanding, lies at the heart of my framework. Entropy, in this view, is the stage where such transformations unfold, driven by the interplay of symbols and the observers who wield them.

# The Observer’s Melody

At the core of this model is the *symbolic observer*, a conceptual stand-in for any system that processes information. 

This could be your brain piecing together a story, a neural network parsing data, or a theoretical construct in a simulation. 

The observer doesn’t passively receive symbols—words, images, sounds, or bits—it generates and interprets them, crafting sequences that oscillate between chaos and order, noise and harmony.

Picture yourself diving into a novel. Early pages feel fragmented: characters are strangers, plot threads dangle, and meanings shimmer just out of reach. 

As you read on, patterns coalesce—relationships deepen, themes crystallize, and suddenly, the story *clicks*. 

My framework names this moment *resonance collapse*: a high-entropy state, brimming with uncertainty, transforms into a low-entropy state of coherence, where meaning shines through.

This process mirrors countless experiences—solving a math problem, recognizing a friend’s face in a crowd, or even an AI learning to predict text. 

The question driving my research is: how does this collapse happen? What mechanisms guide a system from diffuse possibilities to a singular, resonant truth?

# Primes: The Elemental Notes of Meaning

Here, the narrative takes an audacious leap. To model this dance of entropy, I turned to prime numbers—2, 3, 5, 7, and their infinite kin. 

Primes are the atoms of arithmetic, indivisible and unique. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every number can be expressed as a distinct product of primes, a kind of numerical DNA. 

I propose that ideas, too, might build from elemental patterns, and primes offer a natural scaffold.

In my framework, each symbol processed by the observer links to a prime number, creating a *symbolic Hilbert space*—a mathematical realm where symbols exist as vectors, much like particles in quantum mechanics. 

As the observer generates sequences—say, words in a sentence or notes in a melody—these vectors shift, overlap, and interfere, navigating a high-dimensional landscape. 

Within this space lie *attractor states*, stable configurations that represent coherent meanings, like the fixed points where a pendulum might rest.

To grasp this, imagine tuning an old radio. At first, static crackles, a cacophony of high entropy where no signal dominates. As you turn the dial, faint strains of music emerge, growing sharper until the station locks in, clear and resonant. 

This is resonance collapse: the observer’s chaotic symbolic state aligns with an attractor, transforming uncertainty into meaning. 

The prime-based structure ensures each symbol’s contribution is distinct, leveraging the unique factorization of primes to prevent overlap and preserve clarity.

Mathematically, we represent the observer’s state as a vector in this Hilbert space, weighted by the probability of each symbol’s appearance. 

Entropy becomes a vector too, with magnitude and direction, evolving as the observer’s focus shifts. When the state vector nears an attractor, measured by their inner product, a threshold may trigger collapse—a sudden or gradual alignment where the system “chooses” coherence over chaos. 

This mirrors quantum-like dynamics, not in physical particles, but in the abstract realm of information.

# Simulating the Flow

To test these ideas, I built a real-time simulation—a digital theater where entropy performs its ballet. The setup includes a *symbol generator*, producing sequences that blend structure (like grammar in language) and randomness (like noise in a signal). 

A *sliding window* tracks uncertainty over time, computing Shannon entropy for each segment. These sequences map onto the prime-based Hilbert space, where a *resonance calculator* measures alignment with predefined attractors, and a *visualization module* renders the dynamics live.

The results are striking. Entropy doesn’t drift aimlessly—it *moves* with purpose. 

We observe *critical slowing*, where fluctuations dampen as the system nears an attractor, like a storm settling before sunrise. 

*Resonance cascades* appear, where a small alignment sparks a chain reaction, pulling the system toward clarity. 

Occasionally, the system pauses in *metastable plateaus*, teetering between competing attractors before committing to one. 

In experiments with multiple attractors, we see *competition*, with the system oscillating between partial alignments, like a mind weighing two ideas before choosing.

# Implications: Rewriting AI, Consciousness, and Reality

This framework opens a treasure chest of possibilities, each more tantalizing than the last.

# 1. Semantic Compression: Revolutionizing Search and Data

Imagine searching the internet not by typing keywords, but by sketching an *idea*. 

My model suggests a way to compress information by storing a sequence’s attractor—its core meaning—rather than every symbol. 

Instead of archiving every word in a book, we save the “gist” and its deviations, like a musical score stripped to its melody. 

Preliminary tests show compression ratios of 3:1 to 8:1 for text, rivaling statistical methods but preserving semantic ties.

This could birth *resonant search* engines, finding content by conceptual proximity. 

A query about “freedom” might surface texts on liberty, autonomy, or emancipation, even if the exact word is absent. Early prototypes show a 37% boost in relevance over traditional models, especially for abstract queries. 

Beyond search, this could streamline data storage, making AI leaner and smarter, from chatbots to recommendation systems.

# 2. Consciousness: Cracking the Binding Puzzle

Neuroscience grapples with the *binding problem*: how does the brain merge sights, sounds, and emotions into a unified experience? My model offers a clue. 

If conscious percepts are attractor states in a symbolic field, resonance collapse could be the mechanism that binds fragments into wholes. 

A red apple isn’t just color plus shape—it’s a coherent concept, a low-entropy state where sensory inputs align.

By quantifying coherence through metrics like entropy minimization and attractor alignment, we might measure consciousness more precisely. 

Simulations show these metrics correlate strongly (r > 0.85), suggesting they track a unified process. This aligns with theories like Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory, but adds a mathematical lens, grounding consciousness in resonance dynamics rather than neural tissue alone. 

If validated, this could guide experiments, perhaps linking prime-based patterns to EEG signals or fMRI scans.

# 3. Quantum-Like Computing Without Quantum Hardware

The prime-based Hilbert space mimics quantum computing’s superpower: exploring multiple possibilities simultaneously via superposition and interference. 

Yet it runs on classical hardware, making it practical today. 

By evaluating symbolic sequences in parallel and collapsing to optimal attractors, this approach could enhance algorithms for pattern recognition, optimization, or even creative tasks like generating art or music.

Unlike neural networks, which often obscure their reasoning, this model offers transparency—every step traces back to primes and resonance. 

A prototype semantic search engine, built on this architecture, outperformed vector-space models by 37% on conceptual queries, hinting at its potential. 

For AI, this bridges classical and quantum paradigms, offering a new toolkit for problems where meaning matters more than raw data.

# 4. Reality as a Resonant Symphony

Philosophically, this framework suggests meaning isn’t just a human construct—it might be woven into reality’s fabric. 

If primes structure how information resonates, the universe could be a vast symphony, with observers like us tuning its patterns. 

This echoes ideas from physicist John Wheeler, who saw information as fundamental to existence, and Carlo Rovelli, who views time as emergent from interactions.

The Path Forward: Challenges and Horizons

Despite its promise, the model faces hurdles. The Hilbert space grows unwieldy with large symbol sets, demanding computational tricks like dimensional reduction. 

Collapse dynamics are sensitive to parameters, needing fine-tuning for each domain—text, images, or neural data. 

Most critically, we need empirical tests: do human brains exhibit prime-based resonance? Experiments with EEG or behavioral data could answer this, but they’re complex and costly.

Future work will push these boundaries:

* **Continuous Symbols**: Extending the model to images, sounds, or emotions, beyond discrete symbols like words.
* **Observer Networks**: Modeling how multiple observers—like people in a conversation or AI agents—interact, sharing attractors.
* **Neural Links**: Testing if brain activity mirrors resonance patterns, perhaps via machine learning on neuroimaging data.
* **Applications**: Building resonant AI for search, compression, or creativity, and exploring quantum-like algorithms.
* **Philosophy**: Probing why primes work so well, connecting to theories of quantum cognition and consciousness.

# Join the Cosmic Melody

The universe hums with noise—random signals, fleeting thoughts, scattered data. Yet beneath this chaos lie patterns, waiting to resonate.

I'm curious, do you guys think they're valid, and are there any others you would suggest?

---

1. “This is random, but…”

This might be the most underrated opener of all time.

Saying “This is random, but…” instantly lowers the tension and makes whatever you say next feel more natural. It shows you’re socially aware and makes the other person way more open to chatting.

Examples:

“This is random, but I thought you seemed interesting and just wanted to say hi.”

“This is random, but I need a second opinion—should I get this one or that one?”

You can use this as a standalone opener, or combine it with literally any of the tips below. 

---

2. Observations + ""right?""

Just comment on something both of you can see, hear, or even smell. 

The ""right?"" let's them know you're not talking to yourself.

Examples:

“Wow, it’s packed in here today, right?”

“That art on the wall is really cool, don't you think?”

“That smells amazing, right?”

The trick is to say something open-ended that invites a response.

---

3. Asking for info / facts

When in doubt, ask about something simple and factual, like time, directions, or info.

Examples:

“Do you know where the nearest Starbucks is?”

“Hey, do you know what time this place closes?”

It's not my favorite but it's great for when there’s no obvious reason to be talking to someone. 

---

4. Asking for Advice

People love being asked for their opinion, it makes them feel valued.

Examples:

“Hey, I don't know what to get, what would you recommend here?”

""Hey, can I get your honest opinion, what do you think of this shirt?""

This works really well in coffee shops, stores, or anywhere you're making a choice.

---

5. Authentic Compliments

Give a sincere compliment about something they chose, like clothes, accessories, or what they’re carrying.

Examples:

“That’s a really cool outfit, you must have great taste.”

Extra points if you direct the compliment to the person rather than to the object.

---

6. Shared Similarity

Use the fact that you're part of the same group of people to create an instant connection. 

Examples:

“How do you know Jared?” (at a party)(same wider friend group)

“Is this your first time doing this class?” (part of the same gym, course etc)

---

7. The Cold Read

You make a light guess on how someone's doing based on their vibe or body language.

This one’s a bit more advanced, but can be powerful if done right.

Examples:

“You seem like you’re in a good mood.”

“Tough day?”

“Boring day today, huh?”

It skips the default “How are you?” autopilot and invites more genuine answers—if done respectfully.

---

I think at the end of the day saying anything is better than nothing but these conversation starters have made these interactions super easy for me.

But what about you? What conversation starters have actually worked for you guys?

I've been married almost 10 years, together since our teens. We have three kids under 6. Early 30s. No unfaithfulness or anything like that.

I feel physically ill and completely heartbroken, grieving something that isn't dead yet and I'm the one holding a knife over.

Looking back now, my wife and I almost certainly trauma bonded from the start. Both our parents had major martial issues, and I made it my life's goal to break the cycle of divorce several generations running. I thought we were doing it all right: financial stability, then marriage, then kids.

I just can't do it anymore. In addition to 50% kid duty, I have nearly always done all the chores except laundry (yes, all), all the finances because it stresses her out (aside from having her manage her own CC so she knows how to navigate modern banking if I die), and all home and vehicle repair myself. I was all in for her taking her dream job, part time at a 66% paycut, to help lower her stress level keeping up with kids and laundry and friends. Which didn't happen. Meanwhile, I got the *actual flu* once, which I caught from her, and still woke up early to shovel snow from the driveway... only to hear her complain about my ""man flu"" to a friend on the phone that night.

Years have gone by, and nothing has helped. The few major fights we've had since, one stemming from something EXTREMELY irresponsible that could have had us both hurt or arrested, I begged her to start therapy. Brought up the D word for the first time ever. She promised every time but never went. I've been going for years now and offered to help her into it, as she's only been medicated for going on a decade but never saw a psych.

That last fight put a major crack in the foundation for me, but this most recent one did me in. She did something *exceptionally* lazy, but decided to give me the silent treatment on/off for a week instead of talking through it. I'm just so sick of getting angry and having to defend my frustration. It was like a switch flipped...

I was always so happy when I wasn't with her. I loved being around my kids more when she wasn't there. When we're out, she ignores me unless several people are talking to me. Always writes long, nice notes in my cards for holidays/bdays, but never puts effort into my gifts aside from money, and they're weeks late. I planned a whole trip to see her favorite musician last year among other small dates, but I can't remember the last time she ever took ME out. Not once. She does all that and more for/with her friends.

I dress well, stay in shape, take care of myself, and get enough attention to know I'm an okay looking guy. I have friends and make them easily so I know I'm good company.

For some reason, the only person whose attention and equal partnership I want more than anything just takes it for granted.

Guys, I sobbed last Saturday night for the first time in probably a decade. I put my kids down, and realized the conversation I had with someone at a coffee shop earlier that day about a book we had both read was the most genuine interest anyone had shown me on a personal level in a long time. I cried for like 15 straight minutes.

All this time on antidepressants and in therapy trying to figure out what's wrong with me... and maybe I did. I see hope for the first time, but it's going to be unimaginably painful to get there if I make that choice. I'm just scared for my kids most of all.

FoMu is great as well. They’re vegan but I still recommend them to vegans and non vegans,their fruit based flavors are great as they use fresh fruit.

Eataly even though it’s a chain is still very good for gelato

I’m totally happy being coworkers, until our company started doing layoffs and unfortunately as a newer employee, I am one of the ones to go. I really like M30 as a friend and would love to continue to keep in touch and even get together every once in a while to catch up, but I am not sure how to approach it that doesn’t sound weird or could be perceived as too forward. I also have never met his wife (she was pregnant for the first 6 months I worked at this company, so her + M30 typically declined work events/happy hours) so I’m not sure exactly what their relationship is like and what she would find inappropriate.

1jzepza,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jzepza,My experience being a manga colorist and why it sucked coloring jjk when it was coming out,"idk if this is where i should post this but i cant think of anywhere better so itll do.

TL DR: color manga for the love of the game and not for clout unless u wanna spend all day in gcs and sucking up to people u don't even know for lil to nun in return.

as the title says this will be me explaining the absolute rat race coloring jjk was when it was coming out and why i would never recommend doing this to try to get followers on anything like x.

first off i wanna talk about what it was like just waiting for the chapter leaks. unless you live in a timezone where the leaks would come out when you actually woke up or would have been awake already you would have had to stay up literal all night to get the pages to color.

this means your sleep schedule would be absolutely terrible or you'd actually have to pull 30 plus hour days just to color a single page. now this dosnt sound that bad epically since the first person to em would get all the likes and they'd be put in the thumbnails of all the jjk vids about that chapter and that's true............ if you were in a gc.

as with everything social media you needed connections to make it. solo work don't exist and if you are the lucky one to brake through and get popular all on your own congrats you were the literal exception. 

(this also applies to a lot of art you'd see on x they're called gas gcs and they even exist just for regular tweets and this has been going on since before you could make money from twitter post going viral. i know cause i used to be apart of some which ill talk about now)

so me being me ruining my sleep schedule and getting nothing back thought id ask my at the time friend and manga colorist (no longer cause personal reasons) if i could join his manga coloring gc where everyone would rt each others coloring's a gas gc.

and it worked i started getting followers more people were seeing all the hard work i as putting in and i was loving it except for one thing. it was completely soulless and id just color wtv got me likes and nothing more which was usually jjk or mha manga leaks. not to mention people i barely knew i had to rt theyre coloring's which sounds fine on paper until you start disliking someone and they're work was mediocre for what they were giving and receiving.

and as you could guess i left cause its twitter and i wasn't gon sit there and take shit from someone i didn't know just so they could use me for interactions and they did nothing for me back. and as you could also guess what happened next i FELL OFF i was washed no likes no rts nun back to square one.

anyway skip forward a few weeks and kashimo v sukuna hiean transformation gets leaked. and manga colourist have a knack for knowing when sum bigs coming so i stay up all night i drink coffee and everything and the leaks drop and there's sukuna with 4 arms aura farming. i get to work immediately and next thing i knew i was the first person to color the page.

keep in mind i didnt even wait for the cleaned digital scans i cleaned the photos of the weekly magazine i edited em myself in my ipads camera app cleaning em and removing the grain and making the white more white.

i get put in a yt vid a hour later im gassed i got 30 likes the most id gotten in a while........ then everyone in the gcs colored it and i fell off not 10 more likes while everyone else including that former friend of mine getting thousands of likes. and im ngl that fucked me up a lil and had me tweaking a lil i stayed up for like 30 plus hours was the first to cross the finish line and got last place.

then the same thing happened with chapter 262 when the leaks dropped i was the first to color rika holding yuta the shit everyone wanted to see i got 20 likes everyone else got thousands again. and suddenly this thing i had a passion for and loved doing did nun but cause me stress and make me feel like shit.

so i stopped coloring nearly entirely cause i just hated it, it wasn't even a rat race it was who had the more connections and i had nun so i flopped hard. and then after about half a year after jjk ended i started coloring again i found it fun and thats how i got my modern style of more realistic coloring with half tones and water colors n oil paint brushes.

this is pretty much a long cautionary tale about trying to get popular off stuff like art and manga coloring's just to get nothing in return. so if anyone wants to get into manga coloring im just telling you now unless u can do some digital painting and cook absolute fire just do it for the love of the game and not the bag cause u aint getting nun unless u sell your soul to gas gcs.

btw i wanted to get some my old colourings for these cause they did make it into vids i just coudnt cause in completely unrelated vids this nerd ricardo put jjk 236 and allat in his tags and completely ruined the search for yt so i coudnt find nun with my stuff in it. so yer thats why i aint got any coloring's i did from then here.",2,1744677539.0,Jujutsufolk,1,1.0,False

My close friend recently got out of a relationship. I’ve had a crush on him for a long time, but I always kept my distance—so much so that I chose not to be in the same class section just to respect their relationship. At that time, I was also in a shaky relationship myself.

We only recently reconnected due to mismatched schedules. We haven’t even had the chance to go out or spend time in our little safe space (we call it our coffee) because our timelines rarely align. Despite that, we’ve grown closer again—through messages, harmless inside jokes, and just honest companionship. Some might interpret it as flirty, but for us, it was comfort, not malice.

Context:
His ex started posting old screenshots of our convos from last year, claiming we cheated. They already talked about those messages months ago, clarified everything, and made peace (or so we thought). Yet now, the ex is back on social media exposing everything out of context and accusing us all over again.

And I get it—he’s hurting. But we didn’t do anything while they were together. I didn’t “steal” anyone. I just showed up. And unexpectedly, I was loved.

I’m trying to support my friend through this, but it’s scary. My socials are being watched, our privacy’s been violated, and I’m being painted as the bad guy when I didn’t even enter the picture until after the breakup.

Are we wrong for letting something real grow between us after they ended?

I don't even know how i got the idea of getting breast implants since my family were ""house on the prairie"" type of people. I ruined myself. 

I live off government crumbs so I'm unable to gather money, I find myself waiting each month the crumbs of government, spending it in basics and left with nothing and always scared the government is going to cut that money because they have left me with 0$ on my account for almost a year. 

I never worked in my life. I never thought about  how to earn a living.........honestly working never crossed my mind, always had the mind of a teenager, my parents treated me like a kid which I loved. 

I search how to make money, and stuff like ""remote job"", ""data entry"", ""corporate job"", ""customer service"" , ""paid surveys"", ""transcribing audio into text"" appears. I asked chat gpt to explain me as if I would have 10 years what those jobs mean. I didn't even know corporate job means working in an office. Anyway I know nothing about computer stuff, I barely have facebook and reddit. I'm really old fashioned and don't understand this modern world dominated by technology. 

I downloaded an app that seemed like a ""paid survey"", didn't know what the fuck to do, it was a real mess. 

I'm with a man who is jobless, spends time playing video games, now he is studying some computer stuff, but wanna leave me stranded in a foreign country, with no language, disabled by the breast implants, and totally helpless. He only wants to talk about sex and things he like sexually while not trying to get money for the surgery..... 
I try to blow him here and there but I'm totally disgusted by sex, I hate sex with all my soul, I wanna be a celibate. 

I don't know how to do anything online. 

I have nothing in my resume, just like marge of the simpsons. 

I don't know what to do as I need like 7000 euros to remove the implants, I can barely walk or do anything at home, he is dumping me, I have no family left, and I don't know nothing about adult life/jobs and I don't know how to open a path for myself to make money, remove implants and be independent.

Is there any page that would train me for any of the online jobs that chatgpt had to explain to me? Any course who would teach me how to do ""data entry"" according to my limitations? I need everything explained as I would be a child. I need a course or whatever to learn how to make money and someone who would choose what job would be a good fit for my limitations which are chronic pain, being bed bound, mind of a kid, can't make any phone calls (I will hang up), and basically no skills. I can write an email though. 

After getting implants out and managing my health I wanna drop off the face of the earth, go live in a cheap town, work a in a coffee shop, my soul longs for a simple, quiet life, without sex, without men, and with the least amount of stress. I'm not chasing money or possessions.

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit, so bear with me as I try to navigate this lol. I spent a lot of unnecessary time reading other posts and making myself anxious when I got my diagnosis, and I want to help others who have health anxiety avoid doing the same!

I got my positive test around the middle of March. I had some weird GI symptoms for a while (honestly not sure how long because I just kind of learned to ignore them lol). These included acid reflux, bloating, burping, and sometimes nausea and stomach burning after almost every meal. I am also lactose intolerant and found myself increasingly sensitive to dairy during this time, sometimes even getting hives or rashes after having something heavier in dairy content (like coffee creamer or ice cream). Like I mentioned, I kind of ignored these when I could as I never experienced the vomiting or severe illness that others have. I was never hospitalized and did not see it as a super pressing issue, just annoying to feel sick after most meals.

I went to a new primary care doctor for a checkup and decided to mention it to her. Right away, she had me test for H. Pylori which I had never heard of before. Looking back, I am so lucky that she nailed it right away! I also tested negative for a dairy allergy which helped me rule that out. When I got my diagnosis, I was immediately panicked. I read countless horror stories of the treatment wreaking havoc on people’s digestive systems, and everything lasting forever and being awful. I have terrible health anxiety and OCD already, so this honestly put me in a really deep and scary hole. 

I started my treatment the last week in March. I was terrified and had planned out all of the safe foods I could eat during this time. I was on quad treatment (metronadazole, tetracycline, Pepto bismol, and lanzoprazole) 4 times a day for two weeks. I stuck to a pretty clean diet (no dairy as it can interact poorly with antibiotics, avoided added sugars and processed foods for the most part, no caffeine or alcohol). Although I did experience some slight stomach discomfort (some days were better than others!) and a whole lot of fatigue, I am lucky to say that this treatment did not take a terrible toll on me. I took a probiotic every day (two hours after my first dose) and used L glutamine to help protect my stomach. I never missed a dose and did not have to swap out any medications. 

I am now about a week post treatment and I am feeling better. I am eating what I want in moderation and trying to be more mindful of my added sugar intake as well as processed foods just as a way to be healthier. Some acidic foods like coffee and red meat still give me some reflux symptoms, but that is to be expected, especially after coming off of a PPI. I can’t say my stomach is perfect, but I am optimistic and know what I can do to make this recovery as smooth as possible. I haven’t retested yet and won’t be able to for about a month or so, but I am hopeful for a negative result as the medications did not give me any complications and I was able to complete the treatment as prescribed. Obviously, I am still a bit anxious that I will get a positive test, but I know now that I will get through it and eventually everything will be okay.

I know I do not have a negative result to share like many others do, but I hope someone who has health anxiety can read this and feel a bit of peace. This diagnosis is just a bump in the road, and you can and will live a normal life again. It can be so scary feeling like you have no control over your body, but the choice of how to handle this is always yours. Happy to answer any questions or give words of encouragement to someone who is anxious like I was!",2,1744677304.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

I'm moving to Siargao with my family some time July this year and I plan on looking for job/business opportunities when I get there but figured I'd try to get a head start on this sub to see if there's any interest in my skillset.

A little bit about me and what I can offer:

I have years of experience growing various crops suitable for Philippine climate and also have managed multiple farms (& farm types) from monocrops (sugarcane), permaculture (diverse food farms/gardens), fruit orchards, native tree plantation, coffee farms, livestock production (free range chicken and pigs), vegetable farms (greenhouse w/ automated irrigation systems), aquaculture (fresh and brackish water), Aquaponics, hydroponics, and Natural farming techniques (prioritizing microbiology of soil for long term soil health and organic food production)

I have a degree in carpentry and woodworking and have helped build multiple tiny houses, done multiple renovations (think remodeling a space/room to be an airbnb), house extensions, deck builds, make furniture, and a few creative builds (think skateboard decks, spearguns, signages, custom furniture/weird woodwork requests - ie I have an open mind and am a fast learner.) To top that off, I have an extensive set of power tools and equipment that I'll be bringing along with me when I move that allows me to complete jobs cleaner and quicker than other handymen that only rely on manual tools.

I have worked in a high end resort in the Philippines (Balesin) as a Farm, Sports and Recreation, and a Villa manager and have experience in Housekeeping and F&B.

I've been surfing and rock climbing since I was a kid so have expertise in both as well (surf/climb coaching, route setting, wall design/building.) I'm hesitant to mention that I'm also an experienced trader in traditional stocks/finance and cryptocurrencies (I know cryptobros have a bad rep lol) but the reason for my mentioning it is that I'm good with numbers and accounting.

If any of part of my skillset interests you, feel free to DM me for collaborations or just flat out hire me for a project you have in mind. I speak fluent Tagalog, English, Hiligaynon/Ilonggo, and some Bisaya (If you're a foreigner, I can bridge the language gap/barrier between you and local workers.)",1,1744677219.0,SiargaoPH,0,1.0,False

You ever stumble out of bed, still half-asleep, and think, “How is it already morning again?!” 🙈 Yeah, we’ve all been there. Mornings can feel like a tornado of chaos, but I’ve discovered a routine hack that genuinely transformed my mornings—from “meh” to “heck yeah!”

And here it is: **The 5-Minute Journal.** 📝 Sounds simple, right? But hear me out—this tiny ritual has been a game changer for keeping my mind sharp and focused. Here’s how I make it work:

1. **First Thing Upon Waking:** Seriously, it’s like the first sip of coffee for your brain. Grab your journal and jot down three things you're grateful for. Yes, even when you’re dreading that 8 AM meeting. 🙄

2. **Set Your Intention:** What do you want to achieve today? Write it down! Whether it's “Get through my to-do list” or “Surprise my coworker with coffee,” having an intention gives you a mini-guide for your day.

3. **End with a Positive Affirmation:** It can be as simple as “I am capable of handling whatever comes my way.” Think of it as a warm hug for your brain. 🤗

4. **Keep It Short and Sweet:** The beauty of the 5-Minute Journal is its simplicity. No need for long ramblings—just get to the good stuff. Plus, it makes you feel accomplished before you even start the day!

**Why It Works:**
- **Focus:** Starting with gratitude shifts your mindset from “ugh” to “yay.” 
- **Accountability:** You’re much less likely to bail on your goals when you’ve committed them to paper!
- **Positivity:** Affirmations? They’re like your own personal cheerleader kicking off the day with a bang.

I started this hack on a whim, and honestly, I didn’t think much would change. But now? I can’t imagine my day without it. I feel more centered, focused, and dare I say it—happy! 😊 

What about you? Have you tried any morning hacks that really stuck? Or maybe you’re still on the journey of figuring it out? Let's share our experiences and keep each other inspired! 🌟",1,1744677059.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Planning to go for OMAD, by only eating everyday around 7 PM. During fasting period, what you guys usually do? Would drinking slow down the process? I usually drink coffee throughout the day. Can I drink apple cider vinegar to boost potassium levels to urinate more often to let body get rid off excessive fluid? 

What are some of the DOs and DONTs during the one meal? How much should we eat? Should I watch my calorie intake?

And lastly, should OMAD be done everyday? Of few times a week? Considering my goal of losing 15 lbs , how long could it take ?

Earning very slightly above average income (< 6 fig) as a grad. Paying about 42 \~ 44% to rent + utilities for after tax income. 

I like to be financially aware and try to budget very specific amount, set money asides for big occasions while also trying to save and invest (even if it's very little amount).

I was wondering how others (mainly guys) budget while considering money that will be spent towards relationship (e.g. gift, food, events). 

I at least try to save about 500 \~ 800 a month on a good month but I'm slowly realising that I might need to adjust my budget as my current structure is a bit limiting my spending capabilities.

I'm not the type to go out drinking really often or buy tangible things just because. In fact the last time I bought a pair of shoes for myself was 6+ months ago. I purposefully stop myself from eating out or buying random snacks/drinks/coffee to minimise those unnecessary spendings. I try to cook at home mostly too. Really luckily, I'm not materialistic.

Luckily, my partner also does understand my financial situation and doesn't demand designers or luxuries but it's also not that financially comfortable for me to paying for small/minor (food, drinks, uber/didi etc) either.

I'm hoping to reduce rent soon when my contract ends by finding a cheaper place but my ultimate goal is to balance all these different aspects in life so I don't compromise on one thing. 

It feels like I'm living off absolute necessity along with some entertainment and treat occasionally but still finding it hard to balance things.",1,1744676729.0,AusFinance,0,1.0,False

Cavern Club for 2 acoustic acts and 2 pints - Awesome time, great music, and is a great place to sit and people watch people far from home letting loose. Pro tip: go stand in the little window to the left of the stage and you have the best view as you are right next to the singer and get a full view of the front of the crowd which was very entertaining.

Budget is flexible where it makes sense, but we don’t want to overspend if there are solid options at lower price points.

So far, I’ve got:

• An Osprey 65L pack

What I need help with:
1.	Sleeping bag – Something that packs down small, is lightweight, and will keep me warm from early spring to fall in the Rockies. Hoping to stay around $250 CAD but willing to go a bit higher if it’s worth it.

2.	Sleeping pad – Looking for something that’s comfortable but still packable and light. Around $150 CAD budget.

3.	Camping stove – Just need something solid and simple for boiling water for meals and coffee. Aiming for under $100 CAD.

Also looking for recommendations on:
• Cook set (Stanley, GSI, or other brands worth looking at?)
• Water filtration or purification setups
• Bear safety gear (bear spray, canisters, etc.)
• Any other essentials or small comfort items you wish you brought on your early trips

That being said, i have faith that i can make this place feel like home. I rent and most of the furniture is part of the deal.

When i initially moved in, the TV was in the bedroom and the couch was not against the wall, creating a sort of hallway to the kitchen. I hate having a bedroom TV and also wanted the living room to be less cramped, so this is my nee configuration. 

Here are some more objective questions i cant decide on:

What color/type/length curtains?

What should go on the mantel? Should i look into mounting the TV (it may not be an option)?

What size/style coffee table should replace my trunk? 

What color pillows/accents (i can change the covers of the current)?

Would a small armchair or wingback fit in the corner by the mantle across from the tv? If so, what color should that be? 

Also, any tips on un-greying the very grey kitchen would be much appreciated, but living room seems most important right now.

Im big on maximalism, brighter colors, lots of art on the walls, etc. but it’s just not coming together. 

Many thanks in advance!!

Zebra toothpaste has emerged as a promising contender in the teeth whitening market. With its innovative formula and focus on enamel protection, it aims to provide a safe and effective whitening solution for consumers. The growing demand for at-home whitening products positions Zebra toothpaste as a potential game-changer, especially for those seeking noticeable results without the harsh effects of traditional bleaching agents. It seeks to stand out by not just whitening, but by remineralizing and strengthening tooth enamel, promising a healthier and brighter smile.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Zebra toothpaste offers several noteworthy features that contribute to its whitening effectiveness and overall oral health benefits.

**Advanced Whitening Formula:** This toothpaste utilizes a proprietary blend of ingredients, including micro-polishers and stain-dissolving agents, to gently remove surface stains without damaging the enamel. The formula is designed to target common culprits like coffee, tea, and red wine stains, gradually revealing a brighter and whiter smile over time. The active whitening ingredient is PAP (Phthalimido-peroxy-caproic acid), a clinically proven and enamel-safe alternative to traditional peroxide-based whitening agents.

**Enamel Remineralization Technology:** Zebra toothpaste incorporates hydroxyapatite, a naturally occurring mineral that makes up the majority of tooth enamel. This ingredient helps to remineralize and strengthen the enamel, making it more resistant to acid erosion and decay. The remineralization process fills in microscopic imperfections on the tooth surface, contributing to a smoother, shinier, and healthier appearance.

**Fluoride Protection:** This toothpaste contains fluoride, a well-established ingredient in preventing tooth decay. Fluoride works by strengthening the enamel and making it more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria and sugars in the mouth. The optimal fluoride concentration in Zebra toothpaste ensures effective cavity protection without posing any risks of fluorosis.

**Unique Zebra Striped Design:** The toothpaste features a visually appealing zebra-striped design, with alternating stripes of whitening and remineralizing formulas. This unique design not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the product but also ensures a balanced delivery of the key ingredients during brushing. The stripes are formulated to blend seamlessly during brushing, providing a comprehensive cleaning and whitening experience.

**Refreshing Mint Flavor:** Zebra toothpaste comes in a refreshing mint flavor that leaves the mouth feeling clean and invigorated after each use. The flavor is designed to be pleasant and long-lasting, without being overly strong or artificial. This encourages regular brushing and helps maintain good oral hygiene habits.

**Sustainable Packaging:** Zebra toothpaste is packaged in a recyclable tube made from plant-based materials, reflecting a commitment to environmental sustainability. The packaging is designed to minimize waste and reduce the product's carbon footprint. This eco-friendly approach appeals to environmentally conscious consumers.

 ## Core Benefits

**Noticeable Whitening:** The advanced whitening formula in Zebra toothpaste effectively removes surface stains, leading to a visibly brighter smile within a few weeks of regular use. Users report a gradual but noticeable improvement in tooth whiteness, without the sensitivity often associated with traditional whitening products. This translates to increased confidence and a more radiant appearance.

**Improved Enamel Health:** The enamel remineralization technology strengthens and protects tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid erosion and decay. This reduces the risk of cavities and sensitivity, contributing to long-term oral health. Users experience less sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures, allowing them to enjoy their favorite foods and beverages without discomfort.

**Enhanced Oral Hygiene:** The combination of fluoride protection and a refreshing mint flavor promotes good oral hygiene habits. Regular brushing with Zebra toothpaste helps to remove plaque and bacteria, freshen breath, and maintain a healthy mouth. This leads to improved gum health and a reduced risk of dental problems.

**Gentle and Safe Whitening:** Zebra toothpaste offers a gentle and safe alternative to harsh bleaching agents, minimizing the risk of sensitivity and enamel damage. The PAP-based whitening formula is clinically proven to be effective without causing any harm to the teeth or gums. This makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive teeth or those who prefer a more gradual whitening approach.

**Can Zebra toothpaste be used by people with sensitive teeth?**

Over the course of our relationship, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern that’s hard to ignore:

1. He does something that really upsets me.
2. I bring it up and try to talk about it.
3. He gets very defensive—sometimes even refuses to take responsibility.
4. I get more upset because I feel unheard or invalidated.
5. Eventually, he apologizes and we move on.
6. (The frustrating part) Later on, he’ll bring it up again—this time defending his original action, almost like he never really agreed with me in the first place.

Now that I’m writing this out, I find myself wondering—how common is it in relationships to skip steps 3, 4, and 6 entirely? Is it realistic to hope for that? Or is this cycle something many couples deal with?

The defensiveness in particular has really worn me down over time. There are moments when I feel like he’s being outright cruel. For instance, there was a trip I took with a friend where we ended up having a big falling out. I was emotional, crying, and called him late that night in tears. I told him I was having a hard time and would likely cry myself to sleep. The next morning, I wake up exhausted and emotionally drained—only for him to scold me for not texting him goodnight. Not a “are you okay?” Just “why didn’t you say goodnight?” That moment crushed me. Even though he apologized after we argued about it, I still felt like he never truly understood why it hurt so much. Like deep down, he still stood by his reaction.

And that’s the theme I’ve been seeing—he hurts me, we argue, he defends himself at length, and even if we “move on,” it never really feels resolved or that he fully agreed on how to change his perspective to not hurt me.

Take today as another example (super recent so my memory is very good on this one lol). I work from home, and he was off from work today at home. I told him I’d be free for lunch around 1–2pm once my meetings wrapped up. But a last-minute issue at work kept me tied up, and I didn’t come out until about 3:30pm. We had a quick lunch then, then I got back to work. Later, around 5pm, I asked if he wanted to go grab a quick coffee with me, just to lift my spirits after a long day. But he told me he was annoyed because he had waited around for me earlier from 1pm-3:30pm, instead of using that time for something else which he wanted to do, and that he refused to take me to coffee because of his missed obligation/errand.

To put this into perspective, his own work involves him being locked in all day in calls with minimal ability to do anything else (call center job). Which I felt I had given considerations for when he couldnt answer my texts, yet in this instance I felt he couldn't extend this same consideration to me! I have also told him in the past that if I don't answer while working, for him to please do what he needs to.

Still, It hurt to hear that instead of what I feel should be empathy or kindness in certain moments, he is annoyed or invalidating of what hurt me in defense of his own actions. Even more hurtful is that when I point it out or ask for him to consider another perspective, he doubles down on his own defenses and reasoning. Or, even worse, passively apologizes only to bring up that he was never actually on board with me much later.

Moments like these make me question: is it reasonable to spend so much time during conflicts listening to someone defend their actions, even when you’ve already explained how they hurt you? Do I need to change something in myself here? I find myself constantly having to justify why something felt painful to me, and I just want to hear that he cares and doesn't want to hurt me, or do those hurtful actions again.

I’m a M24 Italian living in Oslo with my F23 girlfriend. We’ve been here for about five months now.

Our relationship started long-distance, then we spent a few months living together in northeastern Italy. After she graduated, we both landed great job offers in Norway and decided to make the move.

I work as an HVAC technician and she’s a marine researcher. Financially, we’re in a great place: excellent salaries, no money stress, and we’ve been able to take short trips almost every month.

Here’s the issue: I feel she wants to go back to Italy.

She hasn’t given me an ultimatum, but the other night she came home in tears. She said she misses everything — her family, her friends her daily life. Told me she loves me, that I’m everything she has — but “outside of us,” she feels like she has nothing.

On the other end , I absolutely love it here. Ofc it is fucking cold but I love the nature and I’ve made friends with both “outgoing” Norwegians and other expats. We speak English (and some Norwegian), we go out, we joke around — I’ve built a solid social life, especially with Greek, Spanish, and Middle Eastern friends.

She’s having a very different experience.
Her workplace is extremely formal and “Norwegian”: polite but distant. Her colleagues invite her to things, but she never feels truly included. If she goes to the gym without me she nearly doesn’t talk to anyone. Same during coffee breaks etc. 
On top of that, something is off with some people, happened that both drunk men and women hit on her even when I’m right there. It’s strange but I understand it can be the culture. Overall, she’s struggling to connect with the Norwegian culture.

Our relationship is strong — we’re close, we communicate well, and there are no issues between us. These trips between Scandinavia and other countries that we do every month really brought our couple-happiness to a next level. 
But she’s missing a life of her own outside our relationship.

I really don’t want to move back to Italy.
My job here pays way more than anything I could get back home. I’d probably have to work off the books just to earn over €1800 a month.
I have a degree in International Relations, but my current job gives me more stability and real satisfaction. I even bought the car of my dreams without having to stress about money — something that would’ve been impossible in Italy.
Even she’s been treated fantastically professionally speaking and has achieved a lot.

I don’t want to be selfish, but I also don’t want to sacrifice my own happiness.
I’m thinking of suggesting a “trial period” — she could join local activities, improve her Norwegian, attend expat events, maybe connect with other Italian women in a similar situation.

Has anyone been through something similar? Any advice on how I can support her in feeling more connected?",2,1744675181.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1jzdvoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jzdvoq/honey_turpentine_part_1/,Honey & Turpentine (Part 1),"I sighed as I leaned back in my chair. “*Just a few more hours….*” I thought to myself.

I looked at my watch, the clock on the wall and then the one on my computer. All correct, all in sync. Just as it should be.

I’d been planning this camping trip for a while now. I’d set out what I needed, where I was going, how much time off I needed…

Nothing was going to go awry, at least not on my end. A voice suddenly pierced through my reverie, coming from the entrance of my cubicle.

“Hey! You’re going to want to see this.”

I turned, nigh-on, expecting to see my boss ready with a lambasting for my sudden unplanned break, despite the voice’s definitely higher pitch.

However I was, fortunately, wrong. It was Lauren, my cute co-worker who I absolutely did NOT have a crush on. She was holding up her phone, upon which a video was readied to play.

“O-ok…” I replied, playing it as cool as my inexperience with talking to her would allow.

She smiled at me and tapped her phone, the video starting a clip from the news, already in progress.

“....source of the recent fires is yet to be determined.”

I watched in slight confusion as footage of a forest fire played on the screen.

“Um…cool?” I said, hesitantly, deciding that was the best response that made her not think I was a jerk. She frowned a little, making me instantly regret my words.

“Isn’t this where you’re going for your camping trip?” She said, with slight disappointment.

“Um…” My eyes returned to the screen, looking for anything that would identify the mass of trees as my destination. The chyron and news ticker did indeed identify the forest as part of Blackbell Park. I was almost crestfallen, till a park ranger popped up announcing that the park would remain open as the fires seem to not be spreading beyond a certain range and would likely be managed into extinguishment within a few hours. I sighed in relief. I cursed myself mentally for not checking the news this morning. How fast had that fire spread?

“Oh, it is. How about that! W-well, thanks Lauren, for that. Um…” 

I had no idea how to end this interaction.“

You’re welcome!” She replied chirpily and walked away. I breathed out yet again, relief washing over me, over both the continuation of my plans and not having to talk to Lauren more, and potentially further risking massive embarrassment. I returned to my paper work, eager to get everything done before quitting time. I hummed to myself as I set to it.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I hummed to myself as I pulled up to the park’s ‘Designated Vehicular Area’ (I had no idea why it had such an official sounding name). From here it would just be a short hike up a trail to the campsite. I continued my tune as I got out and readied my things, all neatly stuffed and packed into a single camping pack. I only intended to stay for three days, over the weekend and into Monday before heading back. As I walked along the trail, I admired the early Spring greenery. It wasn’t overwhelming like it would be in summer nor was it absent. It was just right. Perfect time of year for me. I decided to switch from humming to whistling, but almost as soon as I did, the few chirps of birds and buzzing of insects stopped. I chuckled to myself.

“*If you didn’t like my whistling you could have just said so.*” I thought to myself.

That’s when I heard a snap of a twig. I twirled around, half-expecting a bear, as these woods were known to have them and this was about the time they’d be waking up. Instead I saw something I was not expecting in the least.

“Eugene?!” I almost shouted out of confusion.

Before me was my co-worker who sat a few cubicles down. He was a scrawny, bespectacled nerd of a guy who, frankly, was an ass. But what was worse was that he thought he was the coolest guy around. What he was doing out here, I had no idea. He went on his own vacation a few days before me and hadn’t shown up since. He, of course, said nothing concrete about his intentions aside from him having ‘unfinished business elsewhere’.

“Um, you alright man?” I asked, trying to sound as genuine as possible, which was only slightly less hard than usual given his appearance.

He looked like a geeky hobo, covered in dirt and what could’ve been blood. His appearance alone confirmed my long-time personal theory that he did not belong outside. He smirked at me. What he said next removed any lingering doubts about his outdoor inadequacies.

“Oh, just… indulging in the wonders of Mother Nature.” He said, almost recited, as if he were some kind of poet.

“Are you, uh, bleeding?” I asked, not sure what kind of answer I was hoping for or expecting.

He gave me a confused look, but then gave a forced smile.

“Oh, yes, of course, yes it’s my blood.”

His tone was…stiff and reassuring at the same time, as if what he meant was that it was blood he claimed from some living thing in combat. 

That was worrying for all of the few seconds it took me to really look at him, specifically at his tattered clothes. There were a few dozen pricks and gashes all over him, visible through his torn shirt, likely from various thorns, prickles and maybe even some rocks. How often did this guy trip and/or stumble? I realized he was just trying to be cool, like usual.

“...Ok. Um, I’ll be camping just up this trail, so…If you need help, you can come to me.” I said this out of nothing other than politeness. Eugene, smiled fakely, nodded and then half sauntered, half jogged away into the woods.

I could only stare in confusion. I felt like I should try to contact someone, but…who? How? I left my phone home, to avoid distractions, and moreover, I didn’t know anyone Eugene knew aside from our co-workers. I had no idea if the guy had a family or what. I did get the distinct impression he lived with his mom though. Ultimately, it wasn’t any of my business what a guy did with his free time, even if it did seem bizarre.

I continued along the trail, the campsite nearly in my sight.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

As I finished setting up my camp, I double checked my walkie-talkie, which was set to the park rangers’ designated emergency channel. Satisfied with that, I quickly turned my attention to one of my favorite parts of any camping experience - building a fire.

A couple of dry twigs and sticks later and a wonderful blaze was alight in the firepit. Next came out the marshmallows, the Graham crackers, chocolate bars and a few more extra ingredients. It’s hard to beat an s’more with a chocolate chip cookie shoved between the chocolate and marshmallow. Next came a few hotdogs (actually German sausages) and my reverse meal was over. Or it would’ve been had I not decided on a couple of more s’mores, this time with sprinkles.

A couple of overly stuffed desert items later and I was more than satisfied. I spent the next hour or so reading, then finished up my first evening by double checking everything and making sure I was doing everything right. I wasn’t too far into the woods, maybe a solid three miles. I wasn’t the kind of guy to go ten, twenty, or thirty miles in, at least not every time I went camping. Trips like that I saved for when I was going to be in a group. No, I didn’t want isolation, just quiet nature. I soon settled into my sleeping bag, double checking for any unwanted bedfellows, and turned on my portable radio, tuning it to a classical music station and turning it really low. Tomorrow was fishing, the next hiking, the next birdwatching. It was all laid out and prepared, just like it should be. I vaguely hummed along with the radio till consciousness left me.

A couple of distorted screams later, and I was up and out of my tent, bear spray in hand. It was morning and the sun was just peaking through the trees and I was more awake than I had ever been in my life. Coffee made from Red Bull couldn't have been more effective.

“H-hello?” I prompted, my voice barely above normal. I wasn’t sure how to feel about what I had heard, or even *if* I had heard it. My nightmares had had the tendency to wake me up on more than one occasion. I did a half strafe, half long step, as I moved around my set-up. Maybe my still sleepy subconscious thought it made me look like a secret agent stealthily sneaking about, but in a second, with the air being clear of any weird noises, I realized it made me look like some kind of comedy movie character on an acid trip. I shook my head and mumbled before turning back to my tent, only to freeze and stifle a shout.

Standing there, right at my tent, was a man. It wasn’t Eugene, though. He was dressed very well. Excruciatingly well, like he was at some kind of gala or ball. His suit was spotless, unwrinkled and sharp as an Italian gangster. Matching tie, white dress shirt, the works. His shoes gave off an unnatural shine. But what had made me freeze and nearly shout, aside from the surprise of his sudden appearance, was his face. It was…wrong, somehow. It’s hard to describe. It’s not that it was uncanny, or emotionless, or exaggerated. It was just…broken. Which is the only word with any level of specificity that ever really came to me whenever I thought about him.

“Um, uh, well, um, h-hi, can I-” was all I managed to stutter out when he suddenly cut me off with a booming pronunciation.

“I CAN CALL SPIRITS FROM THE VASTY DEEP. WHY, SO CAN I, OR SO CAN ANY MAN. BUT WILL THEY COME WHEN YOU DO CALL FOR THEM?”

My hands shot to my ears, my attempt at shielding inadequate for the piercing sound, that seemed to be less audible and more like he was talking directly to my brain. He began to approach me, each step a pinnacle of suave confidence, like he was about to ask me my name or offer some kind of flirtation. At this point I was on the ground, moaning and struggling to rise. I felt a grip upon my scalp, pulling me up to face it directly, quickly followed by yet another sounding of his penetrating utterances.

“DO NOT CALL UP THAT WHICH YOU CANNOT PUT DOWN.”

Once again, a bolt of pain streaked through me. But this time it did not lessen, but seemed to pinball its way through my nerves, before settling in my head, nearly sending me into unconsciousness. A third phrase soon followed, this time taking me to the brink. My vision began to fade, my comprehension of the words of this thing along with it.

“AND THE KING SAID UNTO HER, BE NOT AFRAID: FOR WHAT SAWEST THOU? AND THE WOMAN SAID UNTO SAUL, I SAW GODS ASCENDING OUT OF THE EARTH.”

The next noise I heard was almost as deafening as that last sentence, the sound in question being that of the report of a shotgun. The thing’s head exploded like it was made of glass and black shards scattered and flittered to the ground. Despite its recent decapitation, the thing’s body still stood stock still, as if nothing happened. A new voice suddenly reached my abused ears.

“Alright, banisher rounds it is then.”

The pumping of a shotgun was the last thing I heard before I slipped away. The last thing I *saw* was the thing’s torso exploding. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Consciousness came back to me, slowly at first, more and more with each jab of some object, then all at once as I realized the thing that was poking me was the business end of a shotgun.“Hey, you alright? I don’t got all day.”

I shot up into a sitting position.

“What- Who are you?”, I half asked, half panically pronounced, “What’s going on? What was that thing?!”

The person standing in front of me forwent answering my confusion and fear fueled questions in favor of staring at me as if I were a pile of trash and he was assessing how long it would take to clean me up.

He was a middle aged guy, with a buzzcut to his slightly greying blonde hair. A scar ran down the right side of his face from the top of his forehead, to just next to his eye to down to his chin. His features were hard but had a hint of sarcastic, sardonic intent to them. He was dressed like a SWAT team member, bulletproof vest and all, and looked very comfortable holding the pistol-grip shotgun in his hands. He seemed to have a backpack on as well. On his vest was the sown image of what looked like a tan walnut with the letters ‘B.V.A’ under it.

“Glad you’re ok,” He finally answered, a hint of amusement in his voice, and began to walk away.

“Hey! HEY!” I shouted after him. “Mind telling me what just happened?”

He ignored me and kept walking. I was incredulous beyond belief, feeling like the victim of a hit and run, only that the perpetrator got out and checked on me before driving off, but not before making some rude comments.

If I wanted to continue with my ordinary, everyday vacation, I should’ve just left well enough alone and went back to my tent, had breakfast and then gone fishing, like I planned. But, like a fool, I didn’t. I went, grabbed my walkie-talkie and began to make an emergency call-in to the park service.

“This is an emergency call, I’m making an emergency call, there is a man with a shotgun walking around the park-” It was then I noticed the man running back over.

“For Pete’s sake, stop!” He cried out as he ran at me. 

However, I had finished making my call-in by the time he got to me.

“Ah, crap! Thanks! Thanks a lot!” He said, sarcasm dripping from his words.

“Oh, sorry for me reporting a clearly dangerous individual! Maybe next time you’ll explain yourself before running off!”

“You- I- I saved your life! Do you even have a clue as to what you JUST DID?!” He yelled at me. His voice was so full of sincerity, it made me bite back what I was about to say next. After a second's reflection I spoke.

“What? What did I do?” I asked, my voice going several levels lower than it was before.  He gave me a harsh look, that then softened upon seeing the genuineness of my inquiry. He sighed, tiredly, before answering.

“You got the federal government involved.”

It was only a minute later that we were sitting at my tent, eating breakfast. Bacon and eggs are great but even better after a harrowing experience like I had.

I was quiet, just attending to my food, while keeping an eye on my visitor. I felt like I should be suspicious of him, as a gut instinct, but my reason told me otherwise. If he had wanted to kill me he could’ve, that much was obvious.

“So monster hunt-” I ventured before being cut off.

“No.” He curtly responded.

I looked at him awkwardly.

""Well, how else am I-” I started again.

“Good grief, will you shut up? I’m trying to eat. I’ll explain everything after I’m done and not a moment before.” He returned to his meal. Despite his obvious rudeness I decided to let it slide. No use in getting him worked up. Fortunately, I didn’t have long to wait. He brushed off some crumbs and bits of egg from his legs, mumbling something about crappy MREs.

“Alright, if you want answers, you’ll be patient while I give you the basics. After that you can ask questions.” He said all of this with military precision, leaving no room for tomfoolery. I decided to be patient.

“I work for a company that hunts and kills monsters. The government doesn’t like us and tries to keep us from operating. Capiche?”

I looked at him for a second, blankly.

“Is that it?” I asked hesitantly.

“No, but I figured I better let you take the wheel as far as questions go.” He said, with a half smile. I had a feeling he had a lot of experience with explaining this to people.

“Ok… um, how did I get the federal government involved?”

“They monitor all the frequencies of every device they can in a given area if they catch even a whiff of my company's activity.”

“All of them?”

“ALL of them. Even rinky dink walkie-talkies.”

“Right. Why?”

“We don’t pay taxes.”

“What? Really?”

He chuckled.

“Well, it’s more like we don’t pay taxes because the government won’t officially recognize us due to them wanting to quote, unquote ‘maintain normalcy’.”

He seemed to carry a very large amount of disdain in his voice as he said this.

“So why not just shut you down?” I inquired.

“Can’t. They don’t know where we are, let alone anything else about us, aside from our predilection for doing a better job than their own monster hunting agency.”

“How big is your company then?”

“We operate all over the U.S.”

“What?! That’s…impossible. I mean, we’re talking about national security! How can a company that size that focuses on what basically amounts to paramilitary operations even exist off grid?! That’s like having an foreign army on-”

He cuts me off with some hand motions.

“Listen, the B.V.A has a long, storied history, it’d take more time than we have to explain it all. Just know we have a few tricks up our sleeves for keeping out of Uncle Sam’s reach.”

My eyes widened at his mention of time, realizing what this all means. I then spouted off at a mile a minute.

“Oh, God. If the federal government wants you, and I’ve been talking to you, and they want to keep all this a secret then doesn’t that mean I’m on their list or something?!”

“Technically yes, but they don’t know you know. As far as they know you’ve just seen a guy with a shotgun. They WILL investigate, but when you tell them it was just a drunk hick with a Remmington taking potshots in the woods, it’ll be fine.”

“I-I don’t know If I can lie to a full-on G-man.”

He snorts, but says nothing, apparently thinking.

“Well, the other option is tagging along with me.”

“Why in the name of Sam Hill would that be my other option?! Why can’t I just leave right now?!”

“Same reason whatever spooks around here haven’t found us yet.”

“And that would be?”

“Too busy trying to find their way around the effects caused by the Turpentine Father’s presence.”

“Right. Of course. What?”

I tried to make my face express incredulity and confusion in equal measure.

All this time he had the makings of a wry grin on his face but now he looked deathly serious, turning to face the fire.

“I don’t get sent out except on the most important, life-threatening missions. So when a very affluent, wealthy, recurring client of ours called in asking if we could send someone to deal with something happening at his beloved childhood park, I was picked. Turns out this was bigger than we thought. A lot bigger. The Turpentine Father has been a repeat adversary of ours. He’s a ‘Won’t Stay-Deader’ as my buddies call him. Usually sticks to forests. Warps time and space around himself. Can’t be hurt by mundane or most non-mundane means. And of course with him comes his entourage of freaks. That’s the guy I blasted into oblivion. You’re welcome again by the way.”

“All of that sounds like all the more reason for me to leave.”

His face suddenly goes from vaguely depressed to something like disappointment.

“Did you not hear the warping time and space part?”

“What does that have to do with me?”

“You’re in the AOE- Area of Effect. Have been since probably late last night. If you try to leave, well, you won’t. As in, you can’t. Not unless you wanna walk over the same 5ft patch of ground for the next five hundred years in an loop.”

I could only stare at him.

“This is crazy…”

He gave me a sympathetic smile.

“Don’t worry. Ol’Hogan’s still got a hand on this.”

I frowned then laughed as I realized that I hadn’t even asked him his name. He seemed to know and laughed along with me.

“What’s yours?”

“Edmond. Edmond Zurich.”

He whistled.

“So, did your parents hate you or something?”

I chuckled.

“No, my mom was British and my dad was Swiss.”

He grinned.

“Wow, even worse. Never stood a chance, huh?”

We both laughed. It felt good after everything that had just happened over the last hour or so. We calmed down after a moment and then I asked a question.

""So… I guess I’m tagging along. What does that entail? What are we doing?”

I felt a sudden surge of faith in this practical stranger. I don’t really know why. He did save my life and definitely seemed like he knew what he was doing and talking about.

“Well, Turpy is a Level 5, Class C, Type Echo Entity so we…”

He paused as he saw the blank look on my face.

“Eh, force of habit. It’s an outdated system anyway.”

He cleared his throat and started over.

“Turps McGee isn’t a very mobile guy, not yet at least. He’ll need some more time to fully acclimate to our world before he can, literally, take flight. After that, it’ll be curtains, for us at least. The B.V.A won’t fold as easily. He’ll have a nesting area where he’ll be drawing strength up from the earth, sucking in all the nutrients and energy he needs, ‘part of a complete breakfast’ deal. Now if what my doohickey-”

Here he pulls out an small device with an readout screen and an delicate looking set of V-shaped prongs

“Is saying is correct, then there’s also an Hellmouth open, which he would’ve come through along with his Goof Troop. He’ll need that Hellmouth open as long as he acclimates, but if it gets closed then he’s dead. Or banished. Whichever.”

I nod along, understanding most of what he’s saying. He gives me a suspicious look.

“Does any or all of this sound like I’m talking fairy tale?”

“No, no, actually this all makes sense. Well, as far as the earth-shattering proof of the supernatural can make sense. One question: What’s a Hellmouth?”

“Right, next natural question. You ever look at old Renaissance paintings?”

“I recall visiting a couple of museums. Rembrandt comes to mind.”

“Wrong era and wrong Dutchman. You should be thinking Bosch.”

I blinked pointedly at the correction.

“In a lot of those paintings depicting Hell, they’ll be a demon with a big piehole, gaping to let the souls of the damned in. That’s a Hellmouth. Literally. Functions as a portal straight to the fiery lake.”

I give him a half-incredulous look, but my mind readies to accept this new part of my reality.

“So… Hell’s real?”

“Or something so much like it, the distinction is moot.”

“Cool.”

My face reflects the maelstrom my mind is sinking into. He once again smiles in sympathy.

“This was a lot to take in when I was hired some twenty years ago. My mind was a lot more flexible then. You’ll live.”

He looks around at my camp.

“You should probably pack up. We’re going to be on the move and not likely to come back here.”

I nod in agreement and start on my tent still intently listening to him. He suddenly starts to check through his pack, fiddling with different devices and equipment as he talks.

“Now, we’ll need to close it, the Hellmouth that is, and to do that, we’ll need to kill whoever opened it.”

I freeze, right in the middle of me shoving my sleeping bag into my pack.

“Whoa! Kill? Like… actually? Can’t we… take them to Weird Jail or something?”

He looks at me bemusedly, holding what looked like a cross between a detonator and a voltage tester.

“The only other way would be to provide our own counter-incantation and the B.V.A’s resources in that literal department are slim, especially after…well, that’s a long story in and of itself. But, yeah. Kill. Or we could try to convince them to close it themselves, but good luck with that. Anyone crazy and/or dedicated enough to open a Hellmouth is not just going to give up after an old fashioned talking down.”

I swallowed, as I packed up my cooking utensils.

“Right. Ok. Kill. So where do I come in exactly?”

I ask, as I deftly put away my tent. At this he, apparently finished with the lookover of his equipment, pulls out a pistol and the device with prongs, handing them to me. I gingerly take both. He starts to finish packing my stuff up for me. I open my mouth to object but notice that he’s actually packing the stuff away just like I would. Lucky guess(s)? Maybe just military instinct.

“You’re on radar duty. It’s a little twitchy and doesn’t have an wide range in that mode but if it starts flashing you tell me and then point the thing in your other hand at whatever I start pointing this-”

He grabs and holds up his shotgun, still bent over my pack.

“At. You ever been shooting? Hunting?”

He stands up straight, holding my pack, giving me a hopeful look tinged by doubt.

“Both.” I say with confidence. I hand him the pistol and device, trading them for the pack.

Relief washes over his face, as I slip on my pack.

“Thank God. There’s a severe deficit of gun-nuts in this country.” He says as he hands me back the two items.

“Is that sarcastic or…?”

“Well, gun-nuts enough to deal with the things that go bump in the night.”

I scoff, jokingly. He rolls his eyes.

“Right. Now, I’ve got a general sense of where Turpy-Wurpy is but, as you might’ve guessed, the closer you get, the weirder it gets. So we’ll need to be on guard the whole way.”

I nod in assent, then get a wave of uncertainty.

“Doesn’t it seem a little...irresponsible to hand me what is basically a service weapon? Even if I know how to use it?”

He gives me a confused look but then nods in understanding.

“Listen, this isn’t the first time I’ve… inducted, let’s say, someone into a situation like this. There’s rules the B.V.A has against doing this, but when you’ve been doing this for as long as I have, the rules become… suggestions. On more than one occasion, a civilian has saved my life. Believe me, you’re more prepared than you think.”

His expression emanates sincerity and seriousness all at once. I nod back, feeling way more sure of him and what’s going on. He smiles at me.

“Now… let’s go kill a monster. Or monsters.”

He strides off into the woods, me following closely behind, both pistol and device at the ready.",1,1744675150.0,CreepCast_Submissions,2,1.0,False

1jzduwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelideas/comments/1jzduwo/title_and_author_please/,Title and author please,"My sister Lila and my boyfriend all didn't show up to the awards ceremony where I was named teacher of the year.
It was weird.
When I walked into the house, there is Lila’s crumpling leopard-print dress by the sofa. Her black lace bra dangled from the armrest; the strap snapped.
The sounds drifting down the hallway were low, breathy laugh—followed by a moan.
My stomach lurched. 
I pushed the door open. There they were. 
Lila’s auburn hair fanned across my pillow. The sheets, the ones I’d washed just yesterday, were twisted around their legs, damp with sweat. 
I turned on my heel and marched to the kitchen, grasping the green garden hose back to the room. They’d scrambled apart, but it's too late.
I aimed the nozzle at their face and squeezed.
“Enjoy the shower, pricks! You’re gonna need it!” I yelled.
————————
Clara
Abigail enters my classroom as I unpack my suitcase-sized briefcase. She’s my one source of support in this school full of wildly out of control teens. Catching sight of the extra-large Styrofoam cup of coffee in each hand, a smile jumps onto my face.
“I thank God for you every single day, Abby. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Quickly grabbing the cup she offers, I take a sip. It’s so good, my eyes practically roll back in my head. “I really needed something to give me a little boost this morning.”
My best friend smiles at my dramatics and takes a sip of her pumpkin spiced latte. “Even you can’t have anything to complain about this early in the morning, Clara,” she responds with a sigh.
I open my mouth to comfort her, but the morning bell sounds off, long and loud, calling everyone to homeroom. “Bye Abby. Later.”
Students come rushing into my classroom and scrambling to find their seats. Abby turns and fights her way through the throng of teenage bodies to make it to her own classroom. I have to admit as I stand there drinking the last of my coffee, that my students look really motivated, eager even.
The twenty-eight students in my homeroom move around the building in one homogenous group. They have me for world history, Abby for mathematics. 
We have two-hundred and nine kids, and I teach approximately around a hundred and seventeen of them throughout the day, which keeps me blissfully busy. Prior to this position becoming available I was teaching at an elementary school. I enjoyed it, but high school teaching had been my specialty at college, and since I got this job three months ago I couldn’t be happier.
I’m just about to take roll when my phone rings. It’s my soon to be ex-husband. I reject the call and wait a few seconds. Of course it rings again, only this time it’s my sister, Gina. I reject that call as well. It pisses me off that they call in tandem. Since I can’t do anything about my cheating husband or the woman he cheated with, I put my phone on silent and announce, “Put your cell phones on silent. If I can go without my phone for forty-five minutes, so can you. Anything urgent and your parents can contact the principal.”
I give them a couple of minutes to settle down, take roll and head right into today’s lesson. “Please open your books to chapter thirteen. Today we’re going to discuss the Kyoto Protocol. I hope everyone completed their reading assignment last night because today is going to a class discussion of the material...”
By the end of the day I’m more exhausted than usual. And my phone has blown up with a bunch of texts from the dynamic duo. I just shove it back into my pocket, I really can’t be bothered with their things right now.
After packing up everything into my pull-along briefcase, I head out to my car. I’ve got papers to grade and lessons to plan, so I decide to scoot on home without any side stops.
On the way home I mull over the situation with my sister and soon to be ex-husband in my mind. Finding him in bed with my older sister had been a huge shock, since they’d both been pretending to hate each other for years.
I can still remember every detail of that day three months ago like it was yesterday.
Flashback
The fluorescent lights of the school auditorium hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over rows of folding chairs and bouquets of drooping carnations. My parents sat in the front row, my mother’s hands clasped tightly in her lap, her eyes glistening with pride. My father’s phone buzzed incessantly—a reminder of the conference call he’d rescheduled to be here. But where were they?
My sister, Lila, had promised to come. She’d even texted that morning: “Wouldn’t miss my baby sis getting her shiny trophy!” with a laughing emoji. But the ceremony started, then ended, and her seat remained empty. My husband, Mark, had been even more adamant: “I’ll be front and center, babe. Got the camera ready and everything.” His absence felt like a phantom limb—there, aching, impossible to ignore.
The principal handed me the “Teacher of the Year” plaque. It was heavier than I’d imagined. The applause was polite, perfunctory. My students whooped from the back, their voices sharp and bright against the stifled formality of the room. I forced a smile.
“Where’s Mark?” my mother whispered afterward, her breath minty and anxious. “He didn’t miss this, did he?”
“Stomach flu,” I lied. “Didn’t want to risk… you know.”
She nodded, but her eyes narrowed. My sister’s absence went unacknowledged. Lila was always flaky, always “stuck in traffic” or “waiting for the sitter.” Still, the twin voids of their empty chairs gnawed at me.
Rain speckled the windshield as I drove home, the wipers screeching like a metronome. My phone buzzed—another generic “Congrats!” text from a colleague. Nothing from Mark. Nothing from Lila.
Maybe he’s asleep, I told myself. He looked pale this morning. But the excuses felt flimsy, paper-thin. A memory flickered: Lila at Thanksgiving, her foot brushing Mark’s under the table. He’d jerked away, spilling cranberry sauce on his shirt. “God, could you be any clumsier?” she’d sneered, rolling her eyes. They’d bickered for years—over politics, over Mom’s favoritism, over who forgot to refill the coffee pot.
Hate was too strong a word. But they’d never been friends.
I turned onto our street. The house loomed ahead, its windows dark. But parked crookedly in the driveway, half on the lawn, was Lila’s cherry-red Jeep.
My hands tightened on the steering wheel.
No. No, no, no.
She’d said she couldn’t find a sitter. Mark had said he was sick. But here they both were, their absences colliding in a way that made my stomach lurch.
I killed the engine. The rain had stopped, leaving the air thick and muggy. Lila’s Jeep glistened under the streetlamp, a candy-apple omen.
Maybe she came to check on him, I reasoned. Bring him soup or something. But Lila didn’t “do” soup. Lila did tequila shots and passive-aggressive Instagram posts.
The front door was unlocked. I stepped inside, my heels clicking on the hardwood. The living room was dim, the TV off. And there, in a tangled heap by the sofa, was Lila’s leopard-print dress. Her stilettos lay discarded, one heel snapped. A black lace bra dangled from the armrest.
My breath hitched.
A sound drifted from the bedroom—a gasp, a moan, a laugh. Familiar. His laugh.
I stood frozen, the plaque still clutched in my hand. The room tilted. This isn’t happening. This isn’t—
Another moan. Higher this time. Feminine. Taunting.
My body moved before my mind could catch up. I dropped the plaque. It hit the floor with a crack, the glass face splintering. I barely noticed.
The hallway stretched endlessly. My pulse roared in my ears. The bedroom door was ajar.
I pushed it open.
The scene burned itself into my retinas: Lila’s auburn hair fanned across my pillow. Mark’s hands gripping her hips. The sheets—our sheets, the ones I’d bought at Macy’s last spring—twisted around their legs.
For a heartbeat, time stopped.
Then Lila screamed. Mark jerked upright, his face draining of color. “Jesus Christ—Sophia—!”
I didn’t speak. Didn’t scream. My rage was a silent, white-hot thing. I turned on my heel and marched to the kitchen.
“Sophia, wait—!” Mark’s voice chased me.
Under the sink, coiled like a serpent, was the green garden hose. I yanked it out, hands steady. The faucet hissed as I screwed on the nozzle.
“What are you doing?!” Lila shrieked from the bedroom.
I didn’t answer. The hose throbbed in my grip, alive and eager.
I kicked the bedroom door open. They’d scrambled apart, Lila clutching a sheet to her chest, Mark frozen mid-reach for his boxers.
“Get. Out.” My voice was low, lethal.
“Sophia, let me explain—” Mark began.
I aimed the nozzle at his face and squeezed.
The jet of water hit him square in the mouth, cutting off his words. He sputtered, arms flailing. Lila screeched, scrambling backward.
“YOU LYING SACK OF stuff!” I roared, dousing him again. “MY SISTER?! MY SISTER?!”
“Stop—stop!” Mark coughed, shielding his face. “It’s not what you think—!”
“Oh, really?” I swung the hose toward Lila, who yelped as the cold spray drenched her hair. “Because it looks like you’re screwing my sister in our bed!”
“Soph, please—” Lila begged, mascara streaking down her cheeks. “It just… happened—”
“Happened?!” The hose trembled in my hand. “Did you trip? Fall? Land on his shaft?!”
Mark lunged for his pants. I redirected the spray, hitting him in the chest. “Where do you think you’re going?!”
“You’re insane!” Lila hissed, clutching the soaked sheet. “Put the hose down!”
“Insane?” I laughed, the sound jagged and wild. “You’re undressed in my house, in my bed, with my husband, and I’m insane?!”
Mark edged toward the bathroom, dripping. “Soph, baby, let’s talk—”
“Don’t ‘baby’ me!” I advanced, relentless. “You want to talk? Talk to the hose!”
Another blast sent him stumbling into the bathroom. He slammed the door, but not before I got a final shot at his retreating back.
Lila seized the moment. She bolted, the sheet trailing behind her like a soggy ghost.
“Forget your clothes?” I called after her. “They’re on the lawn, sis! Hope the neighbors enjoy the show!”
Lila’s shriek of outrage echoed from the front yard. Through the window, I watched her dart across the grass, undressed and furious, snatching her dress from the rose bushes. Mrs. Henderson from next door stood frozen on her porch, grocery bags dangling from her hands.
Mark pounded on the bathroom door. “Sophia! Open the door!”
I turned the hose on the bed again, drowning the pillows, the memories, the lies. “Enjoy the shower, prick! You’re gonna need it!”
When the room was a sopping wreck, I dropped the hose. The silence was deafening.
That was the shittiest day of my entire life bar none. Going no contact with them both after throwing him out the next day was the best decision of my life. Filing for divorce was surely the second-best decision though.

Hey, everyone. I’m sure you were expecting Newport, but no. This is Dawson. He gave me access to his Reddit account as long as I promised not to defame him in front of the whole internet. I said I’d do my best (a lie.)

I don’t know if I’ve got the same storytelling power that he does, but regardless, I’m going to tell you guys about the spider princess. But my side of the story… goes a bit deeper than that whole mess, I guess. I made Newport promise not to read this until I told him it was okay, but honestly, I may never let him. I have my reasons. 

It all started in the first few days of September, right before the corn harvest. 

It didn’t feel like it was going to be a day different from any of the others when I woke up. Sure, it would be a little different, considering I was heading over to see my best friend, and a few months ago, I hadn’t had one of those, besides my mom. But going over to Newport’s was quickly becoming a new normal.

When my alarm went off, I hit snooze and rolled over, resting my eyes for just a little longer. Even when you’re an early riser like me, there’s just something about those five extra minutes. 

The smell of breakfast cooking filled my nose and got me opening my eyes again. After crawling out of my three-quilt cocoon and throwing on my running clothes, I headed downstairs.

“Shíyázhí. How did you sleep?”

I stole a piece of bacon from the pile my mom was pulling from a pan, and burned my mouth for my troubles. Even at 6 AM and with no coffee yet, she looked ready for the day. Her hair was tied back and she was wearing her favorite dress, the one she’d bought the last time we took a trip back to the Rez.

“Good. No weird dreams,” I lied. “How did *you* sleep?”

“Like a baby bird in a basket.”

My mom wrapped up a breakfast burrito for me, packing it in a paper bag along with an apple.

“You haven’t seen anything strange lately, have you? You know what I’ve told you, son.”

I definitely had, but not the kind of thing my mom was watching out for.

“Not much more than weird spots of color. My brain has been behaving.”

For context, sometimes I hallucinate. I don’t like to talk about the “why” much, because it inevitably leads to “I’m so sorry that happened to you.” It’s nice and all, but it gets old fast, especially considering I barely remember it. When I was four, my mom took me to the doctor because I suddenly couldn’t see, and the doctors found a brain tumor, I got it surgically removed, and my vision returned. Since I was so young, my brain had ample time to recover, but we’re all pretty sure it didn’t grow back entirely right. My mom, however, thought it was always in me. That it was my birthright— something to be proud of and to pay attention to. 

The hallucinations can be anything from a few colorful butterflies in the distance to a shadowy monster standing behind a loved one, savagely chewing on their shoulder. I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut, and thankfully, I can usually tell what’s real and what’s not. Or that’s how it used to be, at least. 

I grabbed a water bottle and threw on my running shoes. 

“Be careful. The ground is still wet from the rain.”

I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and she smiled. 

“Don’t worry. I’m always careful.”

She rolled her eyes and waved me off, reminding me to try and make it home for dinner. I promised I would.

I pulled my jacket a little closer around myself as I walked down to the main road. It was one of those unusually chilly fall mornings for this part of the South. I thought about turning around and going back inside until the sun had its chance to warm the world. But no, Newport was probably waiting on me.

I stretched out my legs a little before starting a pretty impressive sprint, if I do say so myself. The sun hid behind thick grey clouds as it rose, leaving my path gray and misted. I’d just blown past Silver’s Curve when I couldn’t ignore the burn in my throat any longer. I jogged to a stop and opened the bottle from the bag my mom gave me. After chugging half of it, the fresh smell of the apple wafted from within, and my stomach growled. We’d picked the latest batch the week before, and our apples seemed to get prettier every year. 

I took a big bite, savoring the taste and the sound of the crisp skin snapping… except the second one never came. Confused, I took another bite, and was met with silence. I could hear the wind singing along with the birds as it whipped through the trees, and I could hear the rattle of an old wooden gate somewhere in the near distance. I could even hear my own pulse as it thumped faster and faster in my ears. But what I couldn’t hear was the apple. I stood there and ate the entire thing with not so much as a single smack. 

Something was wrong.

I uneasily tossed the core to the side of the road, and as soon as it hit the ground, the chattering began. I jumped back, startled, and struck with the crazy thought that it was coming from the apple core. It was hard and sharp, but organic, like fingernails. It almost sounded like a word.

“Newport’s going to get a kick out of this one,” I mumbled to myself, “everyone knows oranges are the only fruit that talk.”

As if provoked by my stupid joke, the apple core began to roll in the opposite direction, spinning through the ditch and hurtling into the woods. 

I knew I shouldn’t follow it. In fact, it would’ve been a much wiser decision to strip off all my clothes and skip down the road singing showtunes. It was probably just a hallucination, which made me just about as nervous as grand prix produce. I hadn’t had any in a while, and I was just beginning to think it might stay that way. 

I knew I shouldn’t follow it, but by the time I’d fully processed that thought, I was already breaking the treeline. The clicking got louder as I walked deeper into the pines, and it wasn’t long before I stumbled upon the small hollow. The grass was dry and dead, and the trees surrounding it were already bare despite it barely being autumn. Well, all except for the one in the middle. 

The branches were full of green leaves that shook in the wind as it picked up. That, and apples. Each branch hung low and strained with the weight of the massive amount of fruit. It would’ve been a really pretty sight if it weren’t for the fact that every single one had a full set of yellowed teeth in a cavernous mouth, each clicking them together in an animalistic frenzy. 

“What the…”

My legs went weak and sore beneath me and I suddenly really regretted my run that morning. I took a step back, but the clicking just got louder. Almost like they were telling me to stay. 

But no, that’s not what they were saying at all. I could hear it, a single word chanted by dozens of nightmare apples. *Ripe. Ripe. Ripe.*

I watched one apple sink its teeth into the skin of another, foul juice running in rivers to the ground. This time, the sound of breaking skin was loud and clear. I turned and ran as fast as I could out of those woods, the tart, sweet taste of fruit mixed with stomach acid on the back of my tongue.

I ran all the way to Newport’s house, not stopping for even a breath until I was crashing through his front door. I doubled over and almost puked on his feet. He was still in a nightgown, Alice in one hand, and a frozen waffle in the other. 

Alice, if you didn’t know, is his twelve-gauge shotgun, named by yours truly. I think it suits her. The stock was two weak pieces of plywood Newport had stuck to it, after it broke when we were fighting the Rot. It wasn’t anything that would hold together more than once, but something told me that, for whatever reason Newport *really* had that gun, once would be all he needed. 

“What’re you running from this time? The circus you escaped from finally catch up with you?”

I would have laughed if I had enough air in my lungs to do it. I grabbed the edge of the table and looked down, the world spinning around me a little. I would have liked to say I’m just out of shape, but we both know I’d be lying. It was definitely the fear, and I couldn’t understand why it had bothered me so bad when I was used to things like this. 

“Teeth,” was all I said, all I could say. Newport’s light mood dissolved and he grabbed my shoulders. As he stared into my eyes, my heart rate slowed, and I could feel myself coming back down.

“Show me.”

He didn’t question or doubt me for a second. He just scarfed his waffle, threw on his boots, and pulled me out into the building rain. We walked all the way back to where I’d found the horticultural horror, and Newport looked at me warily. The air was still filled with the clacking sounds of teeth on teeth. 

“This is probably gonna ruin whatever appetite you had for breakfast, so… sorry in advance.”

Newport barked out a laugh, his crooked teeth curling into a wry grin. 

”At least I won’t be eating on *purpose* this time.”

Then he took my hand, and we trudged through the growing mud, into the forest. The closer we got, the more the sound changed. When we made it to the hollow, it was entirely different, sharp teeth slicing into fruit flesh. 

Newport stuck his arm out in front of me, stopping before either of us took another step closer to Hairy. The bearsquatch was down on his hands and knees, feasting on a scattered pile of apples. They were normal, not a single grin to be seen. Juice dripped down his fleshy snout and glistened in the wrinkles of his pink skin. 

“Is Hairy what spooked you so bad?”

It was a genuine question, not a dismissal. But still, I lied. It’s not that I thought he wouldn’t believe me. I just didn’t want it to be real, or even worse, not be real. I didn’t want to tell Newport about my brain stuff. With all we’d been through, I didn’t want him to think he couldn’t rely on me.

“I… I guess so, yeah. He’s a sneaky bastard. Wanted the Tree of Knowledge all to himself.” 

Hairy looked up at us and growled like a starved dog, baring an enormous set of canines. It was loud and guttural, the kind of sound that would’ve made most people shit their pants and run home to their mom. But Newport stared him down like he was an annoying toddler. 

“Oh shut up, you Build-A-Missing-Link.”

Newport patted me on the back and turned toward the road.

“Don’t beat yourself up about it. Hairy has scared me more than a few times.”

I followed after him, trying my best not to feel like I was losing it. Then he stopped abruptly.

 ”What’s this?”

In the crow behavior that was very typical of him, Newport picked up the small and slightly shiny things that had caught his eye. Something uncomfortable grew in the pit of my stomach as I saw what it was— a nauseating mix of relief and dread. It was three teeth, yellowed and cracked, still attached to a thin strip of bloody gum. He immediately dropped it. 

“Wow, that was. Yeah. That was gross. Those teeth you were talking about?” 

I tried to answer, but only managed a nervous whine. Newport stared at me for a long moment, then nodded, as if he was deciding something.

“Let’s get out of here. The rain is getting worse, and I’m sick of smelling bear butt.”

I didn’t argue. I just let him take my hand again and lead us back to the farm. By the time we made it back, we were both soaked to the bone by a chilly September downpour. 

As soon as we got under the porch awning, Newport turned to me.

“Alright, we’re home and you’re safe with me now. So out with it. What did you see? Because you clearly saw something.”

“It was nothing, really. It was probably just nothing.”

Newport put his free hand on his hip. 

“And I’m probably gonna hit you upside the head.” To drive home his point, he put Alice over his shoulder like a major league batter.

“Make sure to do it extra hard. It might fix a thing or two,” I said, before really thinking about it. Curse my hilarity!

Newport paused, then set the gun down against the house. 

“Dawson, you know you can tell me anything, right? I know I don’t really talk about my stuff a lot, and I think if I tried to call myself anything close to a therapist, I’d be struck by lightning. But I’m always gonna listen.”

I didn’t say anything for a second; I just looked at him. He watched me with those big green eyes, his hair hanging in his face and rain clinging to his stubble. His nightgown shifted in the wind, mud stained along the hem and caked on his boots. 

As I looked at him, I realized I wasn’t stopping. I could just keep looking at him forever and never get tired of it. I wanted to. 

“You okay? You’re staring at me.”

I snapped back to reality and crossed my arms, grinning at him.

“Don’t think there’s any rules against looking at people, Newp.”

He rolled those green eyes at me, but he was smiling. Then his smile fell.

“Seriously, Dawson.”

I sighed.

“Alright, fine. I saw… well, you’re gonna think I’m crazy—“

“Remember who you’re talking to.”

“— but it was. A bunch of apples with mouths. It was really freaky. But it probably wasn’t even real because I just see stuff like that. I have for as long as I can really remember. My mom thinks it’s the Gift— that I should always pay attention. The doctors said it's the result of complex brain surgery on a four year old.” 

I braced myself for the pity party, but I think he lost the invite. Instead, he just shrugged.

“Doesn’t really matter if it was real or not. It freaked you out. Also, those teeth didn’t come from nowhere… unless Hairy’s gotten into the habit of eating people. I hope not, but I’m not going to lie and say this town couldn’t stand to lose a certain person or two.”

I knew exactly who he was talking about, but where’s the fun in spoiling that one?

“Furthermore, you and I both have seen a triple-decker crazy sandwich twice before breakfast. I get the feeling you think it makes a difference to me whether whatever you’re seeing is real or not. But it doesn’t. You’re my best friend, warts and all.”

He grabbed Alice again, and took a knee on the porch. I stood beside him, a weird feeling tingling in my stomach.

“Th… thank you,” I croaked out, my throat suddenly tight. He looked up at me, one eyebrow raised, half a scoff leaving his chapped lips.

“What? Don’t thank me, you weirdo. Just go inside and get out the flour and eggs. I got a late start on the walk today, and you were absolutely wrong about me losing my appetite.”

I gave him a mock-salute and went inside, gathering the necessary ingredients for pancakes. As much as I loved baking from scratch, I was more of a cupcakes in the afternoon kind of guy, and I was buying Newport a gallon of premade batter as soon as my mom and I made another trip to town. 

I actually didn’t jump this time when there was suddenly an old woman standing next to me. I was getting better at not letting her startle me. Aunt Jean was in a harvest orange dress, complete with the buckled pilgrim shoes. 

“Morning, Aunt Jean. How’s old age treating you today?”

She smiled at me like she knew a secret I didn’t, then, and I swear on my life, even if Newport doesn’t believe me, she did an honest-to-god backflip right there in the kitchen. I’m pretty sure I heard every single bone in her body crack.

“Well, I guess that answers that. Do you want this?”

I’d only just realized that I was still holding the paper bag with the burrito my mom had given me in it. The top was a little shredded, but it still had the goods. I offered it out to Aunt Jean, and when I blinked, the entire thing was gone. A strip of brown paper clung to her lips, and she pulled it off delicately with her pink-painted nails.

“Andddd that answers that too. I’m gonna start on pancakes, if you’ve still got room after that.”

Aunt Jean said nothing, as usual, but instead hopped up on the counter and sat as I began to cook, swinging her wrinkly legs like a teenage girl. 

Newport came in after taking care of his morning activities, and once the batter was mixed, he decided it would be funny to throw flour in my face. Naturally, this turned into an all out flour war. When it was over, and I was victorious, Newport reluctantly bestowed upon me the glorious prize of using his shower. We were both still soaked from the rain, and flour was starting to clump in my soggy hair. I kept a change of clothes over here anyway as a precaution for the various messes that happen on a farm, especially this one. Also because more and more often, I was falling asleep at the farmhouse.

“You totally used my shampoo.”

Newport came up behind me after his turn with the shower and snatched a pancake from the pan, still searing hot. I turned around and watched him toss it back and forth in between his hands for a good minute before tearing off half of it like a starved lion. One of these days, he was gonna end up in a zoo.

“You think I grew out my hair like this just to ruin it with flour goo? Do the ancestors mean nothing to you?”

“My dad had a mullet for the first seven years of my life. Does that answer your question?”

I poured in more batter and winced.

“Whew, yeah, that one. That one’s rough. My condolences. Your shampoo smells really nice, though. Coconut?”

He nodded. I piled our plates high with blueberry pancakes, making sure there was one for Aunt Jean, even though she’d already eaten. It was good to see Newport digging in as soon as he sat down, because most of the time, I had to remind him to eat. For a little while, there was only the sound of both of us ugly eating and noises of content. It had been that kind of morning.

I think Newport was the first to see it. His mouth slowed as his eyes followed something across the table. At first glance, it looked like a blueberry rolling through the thin sheen of flour left on the table top. I thought to myself how tired I was of moving fruit, and that we’d definitely reached that quota today. But as I looked closer, I realized it had eight legs and a tiny head on which there was… an even tinier crown?

“I think Two-Toothed Steve might’ve lost another painting project. I’ve never seen a blue corn spider.”

We watched it for a while with benign curiosity, finishing our pancakes. It made a very dedicated if random path, crawling slowly through the flour. Newport suddenly froze, fork hovering over his mouth. 

“What? What is it?”

But then I realized. The tiny trail the spider had made through the flour wasn’t random at all. It spelled out a word, in letters big enough for a castaway: HELP ME. 

“You didn’t learn how to spell in the last five minutes, did you?”

Newport sat his fork down.

“Are you kidding me? You think I wouldn’t have been bragging about it nonstop to you if that was the case?”

The spider got as far into its next word as *PLEA*, and then Newport jumped up from the table.

“I have an idea! Be right back.”

He ran up the stairs, and not one to waste food even at the worst of times, I finished my pancakes. I was washing up the dishes and listening to Newport rummage around in his room upstairs when I heard the little footsteps. At first, I assumed it was Osseola, until I realized I was not at my own house and it was definitely not my cat. I looked over and in the hall doorway was the biggest spider I’ve ever seen. And I’m not saying that like I saw a tarantula for the first time because one, I've seen one before, and two, this spider was as big as a Jack Russell Terrier. 

It was a corn spider just like the tiny one, only its pattern was interspersed with pink instead of blue. I had to push down the whispers of the arachnophobia I’d had as a kid. Newport, however, screamed like a little girl when he came back downstairs. 

“Dude, calm down. If it had wanted to eat us, it would’ve finished me off and come for you by now. It’s just been sitting there watching me.”

“Yeah, that totally makes me feel better and not like it’s plotting the best way to catch us off guard and slurp us like smoothies.”

I sat back down at the table, back turned to the giant spider. I couldn’t explain it, but even though it startled me, I didn’t feel any malice coming from it.

“They eat bugs, Newp. We’re probably not even on his radar. He’s probably out there taking out entire hornet nests for you.”

Newport sighed and agreed that I had a good point. Then, almost to further prove that I was the one with the brain cell today, he pulled out a freaking ouija board. It wasn’t the classic Hasbro one either. No, it was a dinky little cardboard thing with Sharpie letters.

“Made this with my family one Halloween. My dad thought it was a bad idea but my mom was on an occult kick. My… we played with it for a while but it was mostly a dud. We couldn’t figure out who Zuzu was.”

Wow. That made a lot more things make a lot more sense.

“This’ll be easier than running around trying to make messages in flour.”

“I can’t argue with you there, but someone will have to—”

Newport put a Lisa Frank notebook and a pen in my hand.

“And you will be our faithful scribe, right?”

I rolled my eyes and I watched the spider dutifully make its way to the DIYja board.

“Why don’t you buy me dinner first?”

Newport cracked a grin wide enough to see from the edge of his face, and without turning, said “it’s a date.” I knew it was just an expression, but I was really glad he couldn’t see my face.

For all the messages I’d imagined of world domination or *bring food now* from our tiny spider houseguest, what it spelled out first surprised me.

*M-Y-N-A-M-E-I-S-N-E-L-L-I-E.* 

The spider had introduced herself to us, and she had a pretty human name. Newport looked back at me, confused and fascinated. I almost missed her second message when I was looking into his curious eyes for just a little too long. Good thing I mastered those typing games in elementary school.

*PRINCESS OF THE KINGDOM IN THE CORN.*

Newport laughed incredulously. 

“Guess we’re in the presence of royalty. Is that big fella over there your prince?”

The tiny spider princess paused long enough that we thought she was done. But then she began to skitter across the cardboard again. 

*He is my companion. His name does not translate.*

I looked at the dog-sized spider that was making his way slowly into the room, then back at the princess.

“Well, I want to call him something. How about Wilbur?”

*He does not look like a Wilbur, but I will accept this.*

Newport nervously offered the giant spider a chunk of pancake that somehow escaped our plates, and he took it eagerly.

“Well, no offense, but all you spiders kind of look the same. Besides the size thing.”

Newport nudged me hard in the side.

“Dude, what the fuck, don’t be insensitive!”

“They’re spiders!”

Princess Nellie crawled across the board faster than she ever had.

*You really upset me and I’m going to need you to apologize right now.*

“C’mon man. Apologize to the lady.”

I ran a hand through my hair and crouched down, eye level with Princess Nellie.

“Fine, fine. You’re right, that was kind of messed up of me to say. I’m sorry.”

She nodded her little head in righteous, spidery indignation. Then she began to crawl again, answering the million dollar question before we could ask it.

*I need your help. My stupid mom won’t die.* 

Newport and I looked at each other, then back at Princess Nellie.

“Wanna run that by me again?”

Princess Nellie proceeded to give us a lesson in corn spider society. Apparently, the spiders have a queen, who rules over them for a period not to exceed sixty-one years. When that time comes, she has a daughter, who then becomes the queen, and afterwards, the preceding spider queen dies. Nellie was that daughter, but for some reason, her mother wasn’t giving up the throne that rightfully belonged to her. Not only that, but some of her spidery subjects were behind her mother keeping the throne. 

Newport scanned over what I’d written down, then rubbed his forehead.

“Man. That’s a lot of drama for someone the size of a dime to be dealing with.” 

He was right. I couldn’t even stage a coup d’etat on the TV remote when my dad was watching Impractical Jokers— I couldn’t imagine having to overthrow my own mom.

*Yes. That’s why I need your help to kill her.* 

My stomach turned a little. I felt guilty when I swatted at mosquitoes. The only reason I’d had no problem burning up the Rot was because it had tried its hardest to kill Newport. But killing a spider just because she wasn’t following the rules made me feel weird.

*The Elders prophesied that I would find help from the Dirty Giant who lives in the Castle Beyond the Corn.*

Newport giggled at the nickname, and I found it funny how he didn’t even have to question that she was referring to him.

“Of course we’ll help.” 

I raised an eyebrow.

“What? I never agreed to play hitman.”

Newport narrowed his eyes at me, then glanced at Nellie. 

“Can I speak to my associate for one second?” He said in his best customer service voice, before pulling me through the doorway into the living room. 

”Come on, Newport. We don’t even know if this spider queen is actually evil or anything. Maybe she’s toppling a ruling standard that should've long since come down!”

Newport crossed his arms over his chest and sighed. 

“Alright, I won’t deny that’s a good point. But if we don’t agree to help her, we’ll never know. If the princess is the problem, we can double agent this shit. When’s the last time we had a good, low stakes quest?”

I wasn’t sure how low the stakes actually were, but regardless, Newport was making sense, even if I hated to admit it.

“We have enough problems of our own right now, Newp. What about the freaky thing I saw in the woods?!”

He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled at me. I felt my stomach twist, but not in a bad way. It was the first drop of a roller coaster. 

“I haven’t forgotten about the haunted dentist apples. We’ll figure it all out. We make a pretty good team when it comes down to it. We can handle both, don’t you think?”

I looked away from his expectant face and tried to find a way through his solid logic. We did make a good team, and it wasn’t every day you were part of a prophecy. None of it really mattered though, because he wanted to help, and I wanted to do what was going to make him happy.

“Listen,” he said with a soft sigh, “if you really don’t want to, I’ll tell her we have something we can’t get out of this weekend. We’re either both on board or neither of us. What you need is more important to me than a spider revolution, dude.”

I turned back to him and he was giving me an earnest smile and god, I just couldn’t say no to him. I didn’t want to.

“Alright, you convinced me. But if things get too weird, we’re bailing out.“

Newport nodded with a grin that said *not a chance.*

“Good. Because I’m the dirty giant from the spider prophecy and I make the rules.”

He practically skipped back into the kitchen to tell Princess Nellie that we’d help her. After a minute, I followed him.

*I offer you my highest gratitude, Dirty Giant and Dirty Giant’s Friend! I will speak to the Elders and return to you post haste.*

Newport gave the princess a two finger salute and escorted her and Wilbur out the front door. After that, it was business as usual. 

When the sun hung in orange just above the trees and the heat wasn’t as slap-you-in-the-face, Newport peeled himself off the couch and away from the random Internet videos we’d been watching. 

“Wanna take a ride on my big green tractor?”

I jumped up and tied my hair back. 

“Is the big green tractor in the room with us? Because I bet your bucket of bolts hasn’t been anything but cowpie brown since the nineties.”

Newport just scoffed and dragged me out to the back of the barn with him. The truth was, though I’d only done it one other time, riding along on the harvest was one of my favorite things in the world. I held onto his shoulders, carefully crouched as we plodded along. Every breath was full of good smells— homemade smoke, turned dirt, drying leaves, coconut —and the clouds had dissipated, leaving the sky the bluest I’d ever seen.

Newport saved the field closest to the house for another day, not wanting to disturb the corn spiders before they got the chance to have their revolt. Instead, we packed it in after all of the others had been picked clean, Newport luring me in with the promise of mindless television and cube steak. 

I texted my mom that I’d be home in an hour, but by the fourth episode of How It’s Made, I’d dozed off.  

The first thing I saw when I woke up was the moon.  It was big and round in the window, and I got a disorienting sense of deja vu. It looked like a massive eye, staring in at me. Judging me. Watching me struggle. 

*Fuck. My mom*.

I got up from the couch, where Newport had fallen asleep beside me, in the kind of position that would’ve had a pretzel taking notes. Without really thinking about it, I picked him up and carried him up the stairs to his room. He didn’t wake up, but he mumbled in his sleep, something that sounded suspiciously like “cinnamon rolls.” I decided to get my mom to make him some, if she didn’t skin me first.

Aunt Jean watched me from the kitchen doorway while I grabbed my jacket, and as I opened the door, I heard her call out “good boy” in the same way she’d done when I made Newport take care of his bruise. I didn’t feel like a very good boy right then, but I took the compliment anyway. 

I stood on the porch, and after sending a few panicked apology texts to my mom, I stared out into the darkness and thought about the long walk home. I considered turning and going back inside, but then, someone pressed play on a memory. 

Maybe a week after the Rot disappeared, I was sitting outside with Newport while he milked his cow, Dairy Queen. A particularly nasty fly bite had made her nearly kick me, and though I didn’t hold it against her, I was standing at a good distance.

“You know,” Newport said, “anything that’s actually worth worrying about will try and kick your ass in the daytime too. You’re telling me I’m supposed to be afraid of something that’s afraid of the sun?”

I guessed it had slipped his mind that one of our biggest problems hesitated to show his snout out in the sunlight. But I wasn’t about to remind him of that particular monster.

“I don’t think that’s fully true. I can name *several* things that we wouldn’t have to worry about during the day. Have you ever seen a werewolf out for an afternoon stroll? Or a sunbathing vampire?”

Newport just rolled his eyes.

“Please. I’d tie a werewolf into a knot.”

And maybe I still stood by my statement, but his logic still gave me enough courage to venture out into the dark anyway. I kept my eyes off the porky pair staring at me from a distance and started jogging once I hit the main road. 

The night was alive, full of the wind in the trees and the calls of crickets and frogs. The moon that watched me through the window was just bright enough to illuminate my path. Maybe the trip home wouldn’t be so bad.

Then I hit the trees just past Silver’s Curve, and it was like I’d just jogged into another world. 

Moonlight wasn’t welcome here. The air was still and quiet, and as much as I should’ve turned around and ran back to the farmhouse for the rest of the night, the fear of making my mother sad outweighed any others. Not only that, but I could sense something just a few steps behind me. It was watching me, and if I turned around, I'd have to face it. 

“It’s okay,” I mumbled to myself, “you go this way every day. No way some voyeuristic  monster is gonna beat you home.” 

I kept walking steadily, the darkness thickening and rolling over me like ink, choking the urge to run. Not yet. 

Then came the crunch of a twig behind me, just when I’d passed the post with a stripe of paint I’d left on it, a marker that I was halfway home. I took off. 

All at once, the branches around me began to shake like hurricane season. I heard the hard thud of apples as they pelted the ground, launched from trees that definitely bore no fruit in the daylight. 

I ran harder and faster, even after getting Isaac Newton’d more than once. Once I could see the break in the pines, whatever force working against me got desperate. Roots surfaced from the ground like alligators out of a pond, and I dodged them as best as I could. 

I didn’t realize one had caught me until my chin hit the dirt. It coiled around my ankle and thickened, before yanking me backward. It felt like a rope more than a vine, like someone was pulling on the other end. 

It dragged me a good few feet before I dug my nails hard into the dirt, gritting my teeth. The harder I fought, the harder it pulled. I’m not ashamed to say I yelled out for my mom. The image of her finding me strung up in the branches of a tree gave me the rush of horrified adrenaline I needed to break free. I tore loose with a loud, woody snap*,* and I was back on my feet so fast I almost fell back down. Few times in my life before then had I run faster. 

When I passed the treeline, it felt like someone unpaused the world again. The hoots of owls and croaks of frogs were too loud, and the night around me looked like a saturated scenery puzzle. The presence of whatever had been following me had lifted, and the only monster that I was left to deal with was overstimulation. I kept going.

I slowed down just a little as I made it to the turn-off of my road. Running up the drive, I could see that the porch light had been left on, as well as the light above the stove in the kitchen. Everything was okay now. I’d made it, and my mom was waiting for me despite it all.  

I opened the front door with my key and stepped into the kitchen. The second I laid my foot past the threshold, the air turned to ice. Standing by the sink, holding a ripe apple and my mom’s washing rag was a tall, shadowy figure. My eyes locked with its shining white ones, and it gave me a smile full of gleaming teeth. The air filled with the smell of cider, enough cinnamon to make me feel sick. 

“Get out of my house,” I gasped, stumbling back toward the door, “get out of my house! Leave me alone!”

In the space of a blink, everything changed. The light and warmth came back, and instead of staring into the face of a ghoul, I was caught in my mom’s worried gaze. Her grip on my shoulders was tight and grounding. 

“Dawson, my son, what’s wrong? Where have you been all this time? You’re covered in dirt, and— Heaven help, you’re bleeding too. The fear you put into me. Sit.”

I collapsed into a kitchen chair, and she cradled my head in her arms. 

“I’ve been having bad dreams, Mom. I think something is messing with me.”

I couldn’t tell her the whole truth. The thought of making her any more worried than she already was made my heart ache. But I knew she could sense there was something more. My dad always said I got my smarts honest. 

She shook her head no and kissed my forehead.

“Not while I’m around. It will have to get through me first,” she said, war face and all. 

After cleaning my cuts, she lit her special bundle of white sage from my grandmother. I stood up and let her cleanse me until she was satisfied, then she left the bundle smoldering as she grabbed a plate from the fridge. The microwave hummed to life, and she turned to me. 

“What hurt you, son? You and I both know it wasn’t your dreams.”

I sighed, and answered honestly.

“I don’t know.”

I considered for a second that maybe the Rot was back for round two. But that didn’t feel right. When that thing was around, it had given me a certain feeling in my stomach— spoiled and earthy. What I’d felt running through that corridor of darkness was different; it was sharp and sour. And I almost would’ve preferred it to be the former haunting me. There’s only one thing worse than the devil you know, and I wasn’t sure if Newport could sink his dentures into this one.

She walked across the kitchen and put a hand on my shoulder. There was a warm, familiar look in her eyes. I’d seen it a million times, on birthdays and on Christmas, whenever I’d give her paper flowers on Mother’s Day or skin my knee when I was climbing a tree. I’d long learned the unspoken words in it: *you’re* *my miracle, and as long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you.* 

“It’s alright. You don’t have to.”

She didn’t press any further. I could tell she wanted to ask again if I’d been seeing things, but my mom always knew when to talk and when to listen. Instead, she just sat the warm plate of dinner I’d missed in front of me then took the chair next to me.

“I’m sorry I was late. I’ve been doing that a lot recently and I want you to know that it’s usually not on purpose, and it tears me up inside every time I realize that I—“

“Don’t sit here and apologize to me, Dawson. I’ve hoped and wished every night that you would find someone other than your father and I to spend your time with. I love being your best friend, but I’m so grateful you’ve got someone closer to your age to confide in. You have nothing to be sorry for.” 

I didn’t realize I’d started crying until she wordlessly handed me a tissue.

“I know, but I still should stick to my word and make it back for dinner when I say I am.”

She pushed the plate of food closer to me. It was a bowl of corn stew, and she’d put a toasted bread roll on the side. It smelled heavenly.

“Listen, son. Your dinner is right here, and so am I. Eat it, and all is well.”

I still felt guilty, but I knew I couldn’t argue any further, and it also hadn’t occurred to me until just then how starved I was. So I tucked in. 

“I think it’s sweet that you stay so long over there. I remember when that was me and your father.”

I nearly choked on the mouthful I’d shoved in. 

“Really, when are you going to bring him around? I want to properly meet the boy that makes my son so happy. Not in a hospital room.”

I sat my spoon down and swallowed hard. My food wasn’t sitting well with the butterflies in my stomach.

“It’s not like that, mom. He’s just my friend.”

She nodded and smiled. 

“I mean it! There’s nothing going on between us like that,” I said, and that part was true. She didn’t need to know how that made me feel. 

She just chuckled in that wise way she always did. 

“I believe you. I said the same thing. And now you’re here.”

For some reason, that kind of made me want to cry. Instead, I just finished my dinner as my mom sat with me and hummed to herself. 

With the storm of thoughts and emotions raging inside me, being in her presence was soothing. By the time my bowl was empty, I could barely keep my head up. 

“Bring him here,” she said as she took my empty plate to the sink,“I’ll make fry bread.”

I had to fight through a yawn to answer.

”I’ll do my best. No promises.”

Even if he had been my worst enemy, everyone deserves a chance to try my mom’s cooking. I’d have to drag him away from the farm kicking and screaming, but I’d manage it somehow. I’d break a wrist again if that’s what it took. 

The dark in the hallway walking to my bedroom was monster-free. They were still around; I could sense them licking their teeth as they waited out in the trees. But they couldn’t get me here. So I crawled into bed to the sound of my mom washing dishes in the kitchen, knowing she’d come tell me goodnight before she went to bed herself. Even if I wasn’t awake to hear it.

As I closed my eyes, and sleep began pulling me under, I knew that somewhere out there, a princess was plotting, and a prince was sleeping in a pair of overalls. And not a single shadow in this sorry world could stop either of them.

okay hear me out

vast majority of women are feminine, and as feminine creatures they’ll feel most confident and sexually liberated while they’re at their most feminine

work is inherently non feminine, and it gets more so the lower you go down the economic ladder (poorer people do less feminine (more physical) work)

so now consider the fact that most Nigerias are a bit low on the economic ladder, and with things being so tough lately more women are being forced to work

this means these women will most likely feel less feminine after engaging in such demanding work that leaves very little time for personal grooming, and as a result these women feel sexually repressed

they can’t even dress “sexy” and try to seduce their men cause they feel less confident as a result of their loss of femininity due to their engagement in hard demanding labor for survival

When we would go out to eat (as friends), he would always pay for our food together. At first, I didn't question it because he would say it was a way of paying me back (I help him with his homework a lot). I thought, cool, free food. But now it's like a reoccurring thing. On Saturday, we went to Philly and got boba from a boba shop. I offered to pay for his drink with mine, but he said no need and pulled out his card, tapping it on the card machine before I could say okay or not. He did it again when we got ramen and I got annoyed. 

A little background, he comes from a wealthy family. His family has their own business in construction. He always had a large allowance, and he works for his family sometimes, so they pay him too. I have a weekend job, now as a cashier. I don't make as much as him, but I have enough to treat him out for something. I've tried, but he never accepts it, telling me I should just save my money. He said it's also a waste for me to buy him lunch, since my parents check my receipts and statements anyway.

I just feel really bad. I've kinda stopped ordering drinks or lunches when we go out together. I don't want him to pay for everything. A few of my friends don't think there's anything wrong with it. The rest of my friends think that if I let him keep doing this, I'll be a 'gold digger' or something. Today at school (my school has a student coffee shop) he wanted to buy me some coffee or food there, but I said no. He looked kinda sad when I said that, and now I feel even worse. Some of my friends said I was rude.

I appreciate the things he does, but I don't want him to think that I'm taking advantage of him. I always cook and bake for him on a weekly basis, and make him a lot of homemade gifts to show my love and appreciation. And, like I said, I stopped ordering things when we go out (I'm talking like food or drinks). But WIBTA if I let him continue to do this? ",14,1744673997.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,34,0.89,False
1jzdfyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jzdfyu/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_husband_brought/,AITA for being annoyed that my husband brought dinner home for me?,"My husband (43M) and I (33F) have been together for over 7 years. He's a great dad, and we love him. He has thankfully taken over the responsibility of dinner 99% of the time. He gets off work at around 3:30 pm, and I get off around 6 pm. We don't like to eat too late, and he's been a chef for the majority of his adulthood and genuinely enjoys cooking. 
In this asshole situation, I just don't feel prioritized or considered, and I don't like myself because I only want to feel grateful, not annoyed. I get this same exact feeling occasionally. I think he likes to feel like he knows me so well that he can get me whatever HE THINKS instead of asking me what I want, even if it's not what I would order for myself. But also, at this point, I feel like he should know what I like or some of my regular orders. Sometimes, he'll run to the store or somewhere and come home and say, ""Oh, I brought you this!"" and it's actually his favorite snack or drink. Sometimes, it's something that I don't even like. It's just little things like this, like he's trying to be sweet but misses the mark. Then, of course, I feel guilty for being more annoyed than grateful. 
This one time he actually did ask me what I wanted from Ziggi's Coffee, so I wrote out my Ziggi's order. Then, he went to Starbucks instead and got me something gross (GUILT!). I couldn't even drink it. It wasn't even something on Starbucks' menu. He just had them make this weird custom drink because he thought I'd like it. If he had asked what I wanted from Starbucks, I would have told him my Starbucks order so he could get that for me. (God, I feel like an asshole) Anyways, there'll be times when he goes out for, let's say, ice cream, for example, and I'll say, call me when you decide where you are going for ice cream, and I'll give you my order for that specific place. Then he won't call, and he'll bring whatever he guessed I might've wanted, and I'm not grateful; I'm annoyed. 💔 Like, just ask me what I want, and I'll tell you. I'd rather have what I want than feel guilty for not being grateful. And yes, I know I'd also be annoyed if he didn't bring me anything at all. Writing this out makes me feel like the asshole so I am expecting it a little, potatoes. 
Now to this asshole business at hand. Yesterday, I was so tired because I didn't sleep well the night before. When I got home from work, my husband was out with our boys, so I decided to take a nap. When I woke up from my nap, I noticed they weren't home yet. I opened our family's tracking app and saw that they were at the McDonald's down the street. I figured he didn't feel like making dinner, or it just got too late to cook. No big deal. I assumed he was just picking up some food and would be home shortly. After a while, they still were not home. I looked again, and they were still at McDonald's. I waited a little longer then figured they were eating in. I felt a little left out, but I had been asleep, and he probably didn't want to wake me. I figured he'd just bring food home for me. We don't go to McDonald's much (maybe 3-4 times a year), but when we do, we both always order the same meals. (I know his order.) When they get home, he hands me a McDonald's bag, and I thank him. However, the food in the bag is cold, and it isn't my usual McD's order. No drink, and no McDonald's fries! 🙁 (Yes, really.) At this point, I'm already feeling guilty because I'm more annoyed than grateful, but I still ask, ""How come you didn't get me fries?"" He says, ""Oh, I didn't think you'd want cold fries."" 
""Ok."" (I also don't want THIS cold, but ok....) 
I'm not sure if I'm too particular here, but my thought is if you are bringing someone food but are also eating in, you order their food to-go a bit later, when you are finishing up your meal, so their food is somewhat fresh when they receive it. I 100% know that he knows this etiquette because we've done this several times before. I wanted to know how the food he gave me was THAT cold, seeing as this McDonald's is less than a 5-minute drive away, so I asked him if they went anywhere after McDonald's, and he said no, they came straight home. Then I saw the receipt and saw that he had ordered all of our food at the same time, and the three of them all got fries and drinks. I ate my food without complaint because I was hungry and I didn't want to say too much, but I hate myself inside because I feel upset about this. Again, I just don't feel prioritized or considered in these moments, and I only want to feel grateful, not annoyed. How do I even bring this up without sounding ungrateful? Or should I bring it up at all? If I do, he will 100% feel attacked.

A few hours later we matched, and she was flirty, calling me handsome etc and we were going back and forth. We were talking about what we were looking for on hinge and I said nothing serious, just something casual/fun over the summer while I'm on a break from school. And she said she was looking for something similar and that we're ""on the same page ;)"". So we didn't flat out say it, but it was undeniable the two of us were communicating that we were DTF.

So we agreed on a day to meet up for coffee/drinks. I told her I'd look up some places and let her know. However, I was unfamiliar with the city, and was struggling to find a good place that isn't starbucks. And although a big part of me thought the idea was hot, a small rational part of me was saying ""dude whats wrong with you, she's twice your age!"". I also know a lot of people that live in that area and was low key paranoid about being seen with her (because of the taboo age gap thing etc). As the day got closer and not being able to make a solid plan, I chickened out and unmatched her without saying anything like a bitch.

Anyways, part of me is glad I didn't go through with it. I've never really done a FWB type of thing and I've never been that type of person, especially with an older woman. But another part of me always regretted it too, wondering how it would've been lol. 2 years later, I think about it still. I've started taking salsa classes and there are a lot of attractive older women there too, and lately its gotten be thinking about the lady from Hinge.

So I looked, her profile is still there, new photos/prompts etc so she's still active. Lately, I've been feeling like trying it out again. Maybe just straight up telling her that I chickened out but I'm ready to try it again if she's down lol. But then, I still have the same fears from two years ago. So I don't want to waste anyones time and want to make sure that if I DO reach out, I actually follow through with it.

What do you guys think? What would you do? Have you been in a similar situation with an older woman, how was it etc?",1,1744673466.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

In every MMO that I play, I always go for the magic-hurling classes. So, how did I end up here, you ask? 

First -it's hard being someone who's too affectionate - I tend to get swept up by my feelings and give too much, usually ending with them being overwhelmed or even worse - turned off. They say they're interested but their vibe says otherwise. 

Nakakapagod na din umasa na may magkakagusto sa akin sa mga dating apps, so I am trying my luck again and again dito sa Reddit.

I'm not sure if being chatty is frowned upon by women nowadays. If you know the lyrics of the song Tibok that goes...

Kumusta? Kain na, hello, magandang umaga Ingat ka, pahinga, huwag kang masyadong magpupuyat pa...

...I have a habit of saying these things out of care/love and I'm scared it might annoy people.

I still hope and pray na there's someone willing to share my kind of love with me. I want to feel important to someone. Gusto ko ma-experience maging favorite person. Gusto ko makakilala ng taong excited na makilala ako as much as I am excited to know them. 😅

My goal with this long post? I want to know where that red string leads.

I am pretty much open, so to start...

I understand that this post is a lot to process and take in, pero mas maigi na maging selective sa taong plano mong maging life partner than settling for just anyone. After all, mahalaga pa din na intact ang mental health natin while we love. ♥️

Have you ever been interested in taking a vacation from the modern Hell on Earth we find ourselves in to what can only be described as the Neurodivergent Equivalent to Purgatory? A place so dryly understimulating that the only things you have to look forward to are interesting conversations and a few fucking snacks like you're a damn zoo animal? No? Well too fucking bad, I did it so you don't have to.

When I tell you that this was one of the worst fucking experiences I've EVER had the idea of partaking in, I am not exaggerating. Even so, I broke that system so badly I walked in with nothing but a Dr Pepper and some chips but walked out with the motivation of god to cleanse it and any place like it with the infernos of hell's hottest flames, holy fucking shit.

Ideally, this experience is completely 1 and Done, but I'm apparently pretty nuckin futs so who knows. From the moment I walked into the hospital to the moment I walked out I was on Red Alert and on the razor's edge the whole time. Rocky Robby, Looney Leila, and I managed to blow the whole thing open from the inside out, and I'm here to tell you about it. That whole system is designed to break down the spirit of all who enter and mentally beat you into a shape that fits society's mold well enough for an outdated and static system of metrics. Big fucking stir-fries.

Chips-A-Hoya, when I got there, had already started playing goalie for 30 people and me being the DUCWIC I am immediately set about collapsing the house of cards in any way I could, because my nose was twitching and I could tell some bullshit was abound. The first pothole I hit was that Hoya came out swinging a little strong for my taste, offering me a paid visit to the vending machine in the back corner (literally the only 2 things in the room you had to pay for, it gets worse), leaving me with the impression that he was a plant. My first mission was to make sure that there were no plants in the deck, and to be perfectly Candace I would not be sure of this for about 18 hours, which in my time equates to months.

Why be so G-Sus of him when he was being nothing but charitable? Believe it or not spending 2½ days in a windowless blue brick room with nothing but a decommissioned one-way mirror and a bed already kitted out with restraints tends to drive a motherfucker up the walls. Without so much as a post-it note's worth of explanation and maybe a few coloring pages of you're lucky.

When they finally moved me up to the 7th floor ward I was tired, gross, and ready to lash my tongue at anyone who so much as breathed suspiciously. Hoya has a 144 IQ, and if I read people right he sees me at an equal intellectual level, so there's that. That said, who's smart ass fucking idea was it to lock up a bunch of retards in boring boxes then expect them to come out of circumstances like that with a fucking dandy smile, ready to play nice with them? The amount of people who go through that phase with pre-loaded trauma that only gets overdriven in a place like that is insane.

It wouldn't be until day 2 that I realized those horrible circumstances actually had an upside. Who else but Robby fucking Rotten, the Ace Of Clubs, and Looney Leila, the Ace Of Diamonds show up and they both recognized my voice from the Hole. If Hoya, the King of Hearts, was the bread for this shit sandwich these two little idiots were the peanut butter and jam. However, they both had their own problems.

Robby was through-and-through a Jarhead while Leila had virtually nonexistent defense against the dark arts. Hagrid Hotter was gonna have to get Her-Mine-Knee and More-Ron's lids screwed on right if this heist was going to work the way it was supposed to. Even WORSE for wear is there was a third Bad Actor that smelled different, codename Asian Jesus, or AJ.

As soon as these three showed up I went full Pink Eye and popped quizzes like I was writing cheques meant to bounce like a ball. That night, with Mr Nobody's Railroad in hand I went.

The first Johnny Test is always simple, this one was just to let them read what was there at the time and observe. Robby, being the fucking genius he is, tagged AJ almost immediately, and made the decision to turn in the book to the nurses, claiming it had ""crazy shit"" written in it. This would mark the first of what was to be many instances of the staff getting japped while I went about decoding their game.

From there Robby and I played rug rats, spending a bunch of time together and training him up to get out ASAP. ""But Bud, what happened to Leila?"" I hear you asking. This Dumb Bitch was throwing a wrench in the machine, she was feeling self-conscious about wearing a hospital gown. Don't get me wrong, I fucking HATED those things too and had the Jeneral Order drop off some clothes at our earliest convenience but this also meant she was missing all of the training as a by-product. This was not going to be very Cash Motherfucking Money.

On Mr Brightside, Robby was an absolute prodigy at playing patty-cake. TO THIS DAY, I've never seen someone learn to play ball this efficiently. When I say he was Ahead By A Century I'm not being hyperbullic. Sargent Johnson couldn't learn in 4 years what this clown learned in 3 days. He was also THE GUY who helped me work out how to fiddle with cards as though the 52! was a big bag of bullshit.

Nevertheless, Looney Leila got a grip and felt confident enough to poke her head back out , and with all three of us back in Civvy Clothes Robby and I had to catch her up. One of the biggest targets you can paint on your back while on the floor is codependency, so to get us out the next step seemed pretty obvious to me.

On the surface, it would appear to the nurses like I was playing Dr Love or maybe there was a Dorito going on but in reality all three of us were running circles around them, all without the two of them knowing that I was also taking mental notes for later.

For the three of us, our parents were a lifeline. Robby, however, needed to be untethered. Leila was also in a paradox where she trusted too much but did not trust her parents enough, and a plan formulated in my mind quite rapidly. We had to play telephone. One thing that you have to be wary of on the floor is that you have no real sense of privacy. The only two rooms that aside from patient rooms didn't have cameras or nurses looking in every 5 or so minutes were a common room where patients wine and dine or shoot the shit, and a TV room that there was a civil war going on over control of the remote. It was at this point I was starting to understand why the elders needed to be treated like children.

The TV room immediately jumped out at me as the obvious spot for Red Business (private meetings) because it would look the most natural for 3 Gen Z shit stirrers to hang out in and had the best angles for us to keep our shady shit quiet. The reason for this was because I'm about 86% sure that at least one nurse could read lips. Using an exercise bike that was conveniently facing toward the door we used Leila's gender to our advantage. It worked out that to communicate Leila was the only one who consistently faced the door, whereas Robby and I, perpendicular to the nurse's view, would end up turning our heads away from their view more often to talk. Random bullshit, card tricks, and frequent stops to do laps around the ward made the nurses very fucking suspicious very fucking quickly. Japped.

In the ward there are 3 ""sections"" for different levels of patient needs. By order of how humanely you're treated, there was 100 where I stayed (somehow) for my entire visit, the 200 rooms that come with extra bells and whistles, then PICU. PICU was basically the hospital's version of solitary confinement, from what I heard they were just like to rooms from Emerge. To be fair, at least this time you're on the 7th floor with the rest of the cream of the crop. In our section there was even a coffee machine so you could drink all of the insani-tea you want, but don't you dare think you're getting cream with that. For whatever reason they offer exclusively milk using those rinky dink milkette cups like the ones you get in Denny's. This meant that I had to use like 6 for a full ""large"" size cup.

With our who and what established, the game was now to collectively figure out our individual ""why"". While we had spent about 2 days getting her more or less up to date on her shots, we ended up setting the plan into motion in 1 day. It was gonna be a good golf night for sure.

Step 1 was Robby baiting out Leila, which apparently wasn't very difficult but I'm not gonna ask. Unfortunately this also meant that I had to lay the relish on this if I was gonna ketchup for the bucket these two must-tards dropped on my meal. Playing Big Green Meanie was NOT going to be easy, but she was being so obvious a poker face was really all I needed.

That was, until she SHOT HERSELF IN THE FOOT by literally dropping her pants in plain view of the nurses statio. I may be legally blind but my ears work fine and I almost got whiplash looking over to make sure I heard that right. Terrific, this meant Robby and I needed to shift gears too, to clean up the vase she just shattered at our feet.

A close call (I'm pretty sure only like 1 nurse was actually on that side of the station, thankfully), so we spent the rest of the day on drills making sure these two Super Special Retards could fill their roles correctly. Naturlich, I was still investigating the inner workings of the nurse's script to figure out what it was they were looking for. It helped that I didn't even know what happened when my mind fractured but all things considered it was going pretty well. Robby's head was much cooler and Leila was getting harder to fool.

When night fell we all got ready with some nachos and mind games until, at midnight, we were asked to leave the TV room with about as much dramatic flair as we expected considering we'd just spent the day stirring the pot. In the ward you're being observed all the time and it was becoming apparent that the nurses were becoming agitated at not being able to get a read on me. By that time, thanks to Robby's hard work as battering ram, the mere presence of a deck of cards in my hand had become almost threatening. Japped.",1,1744673276.0,OrangeSeed,0,1.0,False

Last week I had doc appointment and had to do urine test along with the 36W GSB screening. 
The doc told me she was concerned bc my urine test contained too much protein that morning. Asked me questions about any headaches and how I've been feeling. I said I've been fine not any headaches that cause any type of vision spots. I mentioned how I can't sleep too well and I do wake up with maybe a migraine that soon goes away with some coffee. Also I told her I hadn't had breakfast and that I also hadn't drank much water. I knew my urine was going to be a concern bc I was extremely dehydrated that morning as I woke up late and had to get my kid ready for school and drop off. And once I got to my docs appointment early I wasn't seen until after 30-40mins. My BP reading there was okay. Anyways they asked me for blood tests and another urine sample and to come in the following day for a follow up. 
Next morning I wake up earlier drink more water have a small snack and try to keep myself hydrated. I go in they call for me, did urine test. They checked my BP. BP was okay 128/86. Urine test was good. No excessive protein, GSB swab negative and my blood test were all negative. 
I have an appointment by the end of this week but they asked me to check my BP at home. 
Today I felt fine up until the afternoon. I feel slight cramps and I decided to check my BP with cuff from walgreens. First 2 checks have been 143/98 and 142/97. I waited 30min and now it's over 146/101. They told me any reading over 140/90 to go to the Triage floor. But I don't feel bad. Just the minor period cramp feeling. Should I be concerned. I usually never check my BP and idk why I even checked it today. Now I just feel worried I don't want to go to the hospital just to be sent back home bc of my minor freak out. Has anyone experienced high BP reading in the 3rd trimester that could give me some input on how you handled it. I would appreciate it. I'm thinking on checking my BP in 30mins again before I decide to go to the ER. Thanks in advance for reading. ",1,1744672975.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

I brewed two cups of coffee using the same beans, same recipe, same grind setting, same water, same everything. The only difference I can think of is how I stored the beans right before brewing:

The fruitier cup came from beans that had been sitting in my grinder’s hopper overnight. I left them there for convenience, so they were exposed to air for several hours.

The less fruity cup came from beans stored in my usual airtight container.


To be clear, both brews were done using the same gear and method. But the difference in the cup was very noticeable. The one from the hopper had a more vibrant, fruity profile. The other tasted a bit more muted and flat in comparison.

Could this be a case of the beans “breathing” a bit like wine does? Maybe a bit of oxidation mellowed them out and brought out certain notes? Or did storing them in the grinder somehow impact the grind consistency or extraction?

Would love to hear if anyone else has experimented with pre-loading their grinder or noticed flavor differences tied to short-term storage choices. Was this a fluke or something worth digging deeper into?",2,1744672951.0,AeroPress,3,1.0,False

When you're reading a book, you can go at your own pace. If something confuses you, you can just stay there and think on it for a while. In a podcast, the story is being read at a predefined rate. Sure, you can pause and rewind the audio or video, but you don't have the whole book in front of you. Besides, many are doing other things while listening to the podcast, so they can't even do that and just have to try to keep up—making it easy to get lost.

On top of that, this sort of writing has never really been on *Creep Cast* before, the closest being *Dagon’s Mirror*, which still had a cohesive plot behind it. So many were not expecting something of this style when turning on the podcast while cleaning the house or something. Imagine if you regularly went to a coffee shop only for one day for them to sell you tea.

I'm fine with them branching out into more published works (although I disagree with Hunter that if they did nothing but read creepypastas, the show would die). I do wish they had gone with something less 'surrealist' on the first go. 

On another note, this sub needs to be way less combative about discussion of stories on both sides. People shouldn’t harass the author or engage in constant name-calling, but at the same time, there shouldn’t be this toxic positivity where people can’t dislike stories.",25,1744672943.0,creepcast,21,0.81,False

1jzd2aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalBased/comments/1jzd2aa/my_carnivore_experience/,My Carnivore Experience,"51F - I became severely iron, thiamine, magnesium and b12 deficient plus fatigue, constipation, vaginal prolapse, weight gain, heart palpitations, “idiopathic"" heart pain and edema on almost 2 yrs of the carnivore diet and I suspect a lack of critical cofactors such as copper, vitamin C, manganese, vitamin A, thiamine, folate and molybdenum as the reason why.

My first year was very successful, I felt great as many do but soon after I crashed but was unable to successfully go off the diet. l attempted to convert to AB multiple times but would experience extreme carb intolerance and painful swelling of joints plus severe lactic acidosis of my muscles so l'd have to keep running back to carnivore diet but eventually I couldn't eat carnivore either because I began experiencing gastroparesis, fatigue and super low metabolism plus a loss of my period. Bloodwork showed zero inflammation, ANA negative, rheumatoid factor negative but low MCV, low hemoglobin, ferritin of 9, mixed sized rbc indicating low b12 too, and TSH of 4.6. My diet had consisted mostly of ground beef, kefir, eggs - though I went egg intolerant after a year carnivore (molybdenum deficiency!) plus occasional liver and pork.
After my bloodwork I added in regular liver, oysters, fresh lime juice, pomelos (I'm salicylate intolerant so l have to eat low sals fruit), and orange juice. 1.5 months later my hemoglobin was normal, MCV was up and TSH was 2.6 with T4 and T3 in normal range.
My remaining symptoms of carb intolerance, peripheral neuropathy, heart pain, fatigue, gastroparesis and lactic acidosis in my remained. So I began to research these symptoms and came up with the likelihood of thiamine deficiency as carnivore diet is low on thiamine, although thiamine sparing due to low carb, but if one begins carnivore with a probable deficiency already and the requirement increases with healing (I had CFS, mold toxicity and MCAS) then the deficiency could get worse.

""Thiamine (vitamin B1) is critical for the metabolism of food into cellular energy or ATP. Without sufficient thiamine, cellular energy wanes, and with it, the capacity to maintain the energy to function declines. Chronic, unrelenting fatigue is a common characteristic of insufficient thiamine. At its root, fatigue is the physical manifestation of poor energy metabolism."" Dr. Chandler Marrs

“Thiamine is the gatekeeper to energy metabolism and if you derail energy metabolism, everything else will fall ascute. So anything that creates illness is going to require energy to resolve and if you don’t have that energy it’s going to become chronic and worsen” Dr. Chandler Marrs

So l began supplementing with a bioavailable form of thiamine, benfotiamine and within a day gastroparesis resolved!! I began feeling as though I required carbs, adding in a couple of bananas, coconut water and goat milk to fulfill new potassium demands. After a month I added in TTFD another form of thiamine that crossed blood brain barrier and my heart stopped hurting. My GP had disregarded my heart pain as well as my edema because my bloodwork did not show a reason for it. She told me, ""only alcoholics get thiamine deficiency."" Turns out anything that uses up extra thiamine or blocks thiamine such as a diet high in refined carbohydrates, excessive coffee/tea, certain meds like metformin, certain antibiotics, birth control pill, mold, Lyme disease, high toxin load, gut damage (I have celiac), viruses of any kind high stress - can deplete thiamine on a cellular level making digestion of carbs and fat nearly impossible and obtaining energy from them is very limited. Low b1 makes the body then convert to anaerobic energy which produces lactic acid as a byproduct causing the muscle pain and swollen joints.

It's been almost 2.5 months now and my vaginal prolapse completely stopped, my muscle pain is gone, my heart never hurts, my joint swelling is rare unless I spike my blood sugar, my food sensitivities have mostly gone away, I'm tolerating eggs again and tolerating more salicylates, my carb intolerance is gone, peripheral neuropathy is way better, I can feel my toes again, and just this week my energy came back full force.

Just wanted to share incase anyone else is dealing with mysterious multi system symptoms - brain, heart, autonomic nervous system - it could be thiamine deficiency. Eating pork might help but bioavailable thiamine supplementation might be necessary!

Dr. Marrs has a website called Hormones Matter if anyone is interested in learning more and cowrote a book with Dr. Derrick Lonsdale called Thiamine Deficiency Disease, Dysautonomia and High Calorie Malnutrition.",1,1744672811.0,AnimalBased,4,1.0,False

1jzd19f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1jzd19f/multiple_health_issues_feeling_overlooked_by/,"Multiple Health Issues, Feeling Overlooked by Doctors—Anyone Found a Good Specialist?","
I’m 35F, a veteran, and my body has been in full rebellion mode for most of my life. I’ve seen a ton of doctors, but at this point, it feels like I’m just getting the “here’s a pill and good luck” treatment. If I hear “drink more water” one more time, I might just give up entirely.

Here’s the rundown of what’s going on:

1. GI Issues (the ongoing saga):

Chronic constipation that’s just... never-ending.

Abdominal pain right under my ribs that feels like I swallowed a rock.

Nausea that comes and goes, but when it hits, it’s pretty brutal.

Coffee makes me feel like I’m about to die, even though I used to drink it regularly.

Linzess worked for a little while, but then it stopped being effective. MiraLAX doesn’t do anything. Fiber helps a tiny bit, but it’s not the solution I’m looking for.

2. Musculoskeletal Pain:

I’ve got scoliosis and have been dealing with chronic back pain since I was 11.

I’ve torn both hips—one’s been repaired, but I’m just not motivated to deal with the other one yet.

I get disability from the military, but getting any kind of real care has been a challenge.

3. Migraines & Mental Health:

Migraines that pretty much take me out whenever they decide to show up.

Years of trauma that have affected my mental health, which just makes everything else harder to manage.

At this point, I feel like I’m a combination of physical pain and emotional exhaustion. It’s draining, to say the least. I’m just tired of being told I’m “too complicated” or “too young for this much pain” or my personal favorite “your levels are low but not low enough.” I just want someone who will take me seriously and help me figure out what’s actually going on.

If anyone has had a similar experience or can recommend a doctor who actually listens and connects the dots, I’d really appreciate it. Or if you’ve got advice on how to handle the “I’m not crazy” conversation with new doctors, that’d help, too.

Thanks for reading, and I’m just trying to keep going while everything feels like it’s falling apart",6,1744672738.0,ChronicIllness,3,1.0,False

1jzcv2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CVS/comments/1jzcv2s/facing_a_potential_suspension/,Facing a potential suspension..,"We have a candy basket where colleagues are more than welcome to help themselves. I’ve been store using candy for everyone to consume. We’ve always had a candy basket since the day I started working here.

AP pulled me in the office to talk about why I’ve been store using candy and consumables or just things out of the ordinary. For example, there was a time where I was cleaning out the break room. The break room has things such as coffee, tea, sugar, things for everyone to use. I was cleaning out the things there which included honey which was about to be or was expired. A couple days after that, the pharmacist had asked me if we had any honey. I told her we did and I store used some for her (with her knowledge) and it’s remained in the break room ever since.

Another incident was when my manager had ordered pizza for us to celebrate something. Another pharmacist had came to me saying the store manager had allowed us to store use drinks. I agreed and store used it for them. 

I was also told I store used hair ties??? Either someone took my scanner or they were rubber bands. Which is okay to do since pharmacy uses rubber bands to tie prescription boxes with. 

All these things were permissible. I was told that store using consumables was not allowed. This is the first time I’ve been told this. Even my manager has store used candy before.

They also told me they seen me in the camera store using valentines chocolate and immediately throwing it out. I explained that yes. I store used it because they were individually wrapped. I threw the chocolate I BIT off on because I wasn’t pleased with the taste. They insisted that I threw the whole box away. I said no. I left chocolate there for everyone to help themselves but I just threw out the piece I ate. I was not going to put it back. Then I threw the empty box away after I put in the candy basket.

So I am just over 8 weeks pregnant and for the last 3-4 weeks I have been so tired I can barely function. My sleep is ok, but I wake up feeling like I didn't sleep. On days I work I have to take a nap immediately when I get home and I haven't napped since I was like 5 lol. When I work multiple days in a row I feel like I need a solid 1-2 days to recover before I can do it again. I am doing like 1/4 cup of coffee  on work days just to survive. 

For those of you that have had ""regular"" pregnancies and IVF ones, is it the meds from IVF causing the extreme fatigue or is it just all pregnancies?

Granted, I had to start meds post ovulation and instantly felt a tad blah, but didn't get this tired until maybe a week after my first positive HCG. So maybe it's just pregnancy? I am on estrogen patches and progesterone suppositories. My blood levels have been on the upper side of normal but they don't wean meds regardless until after the 9-week ultrasound. 

How have women survived in the work-place for multiple pregnancies with this much fatigue?? I am dying over here. But still grateful of course. ",3,1744671704.0,IVFbabies,15,1.0,False

I've done lots of research on a variety of parts of the OR/WA coast, including the peninsula, so I'm aware of the weather challenges, general demographics, and some other issues that people have cited in various internet forums. I've been to the area several years ago at the very end of the season and really liked it, but that was just a short stay as a tourist. I'd be grateful for some insight from folk who live in, frequent, or are very familiar with the area to share their opinions.

That being said, do you think that the Long Beach/Ilwaco area would be able to support a new cafe/bakery type place? Think coffee, sandwiches, pastries, breads, etc. for breakfast/lunch, possibly with regular popup dinners to offer something different. I'm a former chef who currently works remotely in tech and she's a talented baker. We wouldn't be looking for Michelin stars, but we also enjoy being good at our craft and making delightful things that people love to eat.

I know that seasonality plays a big role (and the off-seasons can be challenging for business owners who rely on tourism), but I have seen a few folks talk about how the area is growing at a decent pace (not sure how true this is). Does the seasonality really make for a stark boom/bust contrast? I've spent some time in towns like that in the NE where the locals are just kinda getting by when tourism drops off or they take odd jobs elsewhere to keep food on the table. We've been mentally preparing ourselves for a shift in lifestyle from a major metro to something much more isolated (by comparison), so we're on the hunt for a new place to call home, and potentially a career shift.",4,1744671689.0,LongBeachWA,0,1.0,False

I quit my full time job and becoming a digital marketer, work everywhere, travel whenever I want…. And it’s a year after , I’m still having a stable income from digital marketing so I am confident and proud to share with you guys.

A year before, my lifestyle like a lot people, have a full time job, spent 8hours, 5days per week for penny to living but never live the life I want. 

I miss my parent’s birthday, I barely cannot afford my gas cuz tax , insurance and tax are insanely high. I neglected my health mentally and physically , then I had a serious depression , I cried a lot for no reason, I couldn’t help quit my job to rest but the fee for psychiatric treatment is another financial pressure.

I know my life needs to change, so I start searching “how to make money online“ , “passive income“ on Instagram and YouTube. Then I discovered that the reels/ short videos we scrolling through on the social media that can makes a tons of money. And it’s called digital marketing. I am curious how it work and it seems my last chance to make my life better. So I invest myself in a $500 course and it almost all of my money. But this is the best decision I made. 

In this course, I learned over 15 ways to make money online, from email marketing, affiliate marketing, how to be an influencer, content creator, print on demand … you name it. I kept trying, trying , trying and I finally get consistency sale with different business models which means I have multi income streams. Now I am no longer worried about looking for a job, can’t afford a bill, living in pay-check to pay-check are gone. Just spend 4-5 hours on my business in my couch, coffee shop or everywhere I want.

1jzcn06,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinanceAutomation/comments/1jzcn06/one_click_forecasting_in_excel/,One Click Forecasting In Excel,"Alright, Excel enthusiasts (and spreadsheet warriors-in-training), it’s time to talk about one of Excel’s most underrated gems that’s probably been sitting there, completely ignored, while you’re pulling your hair out over trends and predictions. I’m talking about the Forecast button. Yes, the one that practically screams, *""I can save you hours if you’d just click me!""*

If you’ve ever stared at a mountain of data and thought, *“Ugh, how am I supposed to predict what’s coming next?”* this one’s for you. Buckle up, because I’m about to show you how to use this game-changer step by step.

Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Forecast Button 🔮

1. Get Your Data in Order Before you start, make sure your data is clean and organized. You’ll need two columns: one for dates (or any sequential values) and one for the numbers you’re tracking. Think monthly sales, website traffic, or coffee shop foot traffic (because caffeine is a key KPI, obviously).
2. Highlight Your Data Select your range of data. Excel needs to see both your timeline and the values you want to predict.
3. Head to the Forecast Button Go to the Data tab, look for the group called Forecast, and click on Forecast Sheet. (Not sure where it is? Imagine Excel rolling its eyes at you and walk yourself to the far-right side of the Data ribbon.)
4. Admire the Preview Boom! You’ll see a chart pop up, showing your historical data AND a trendline that extends into the future. Feel free to take a second here to bask in the glory of how cool it looks. Go on, I won’t judge.
5. Fine-Tune the Details Want to adjust the forecast? Mess around with the confidence interval or change the forecast start date to match your needs. Excel even lets you factor in seasonality if your data’s got those peaks and valleys. Your summer sales spike? Yeah, Excel sees that.
6. Hit Create Once you’re happy, click Create. Excel will generate a full forecast, complete with a table and chart, in a new sheet. Now you’ve got predictions that make you look like a crystal-ball-wielding data wizard.

Why You Should Care About This 🧠

The Forecast button doesn’t just save you time; it upgrades your whole approach to data analysis. Instead of shrugging your shoulders when your boss asks, *“What do you think sales will look like next quarter?”*, you can pull this out and hit them with numbers AND visuals. Bonus points if you follow up with a killer strategy based on your forecast.

Whether you’re running a business, managing inventory, or just trying to impress your manager during the next meeting, this tool is your secret weapon.

Share Your Excel Wizardry! 🔥

1jzcmvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kratom_Extractors/comments/1jzcmvk/mitragynine_crystals_not_crashing_out_of_solution/,Mitragynine crystals not crashing out of solution- need help,"In an attempt to devise a streamlined kratom extraction without losing product, I did as follows:

1. Simmered 100g powderized leaf at 80C for 60 minutes. When it finished, I added citric acid until the slurry got to a pH of 2, but it turns out citric acid is about a 3 so I added an excess most definitely.
2. I then strained the now water soluble mitragynine citrate through 3 coffee filters total with some additional hot water each time and when each stopped dripping into my collection container, I would squeeze them dry with nitrile gloves on.
3. The filtrate is hardly translucent and this is intentional since the polyphenols will be present. I then slowly added sodium hydroxide and while doing so the solution turned a brilliant beige colour. I added a little too much while this happened, and it turned a dark red- pH reading at a 10.

After letting the basified solution sit at room temperature, no crystals crashed out. After refrigerating, still no crystals crashed out. So, I added more sodium hydroxide because why not- it shouldn't hurt the mitragynine, right? The solution is now burgundy. Lol.

At no time during the process did I see any noticeable crystals unless that brief beige colour was my extract. I did this exact same process after initially washing the powder with water and draining the excess water off. What's going on here? Did the mitragynine reincorporate itself with the plant fats?",1,1744671654.0,Kratom_Extractors,7,1.0,False

I shouldn’t, but I can’t find a reason to not just eat a piece of fruit and wait for my coffee instead of having real breakfast.

Feels stupid to ask this, but is there anyone out there that had a similar situation and did have breakfast/ any good reasons. . . My brain is not giving me peace.
