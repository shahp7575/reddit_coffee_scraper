I (30M) moved out to Dallas TX about a year ago and bought my first home. During my first week in my new house, I was welcomed by different neighbors in the area and since then, I have ran into these people on almost a weekly basis.

My neighborhood is very quiet and is one of those types of neighborhoods where families are always out walking and the streets are always full of people. However, I am convinced that my neighbor (30-35ish F) who lives in the house directly across from me is spying on me.

If it matters, I am a black man, about 6’5 with an athletic build. And this woman is a white woman, on the petite side, and maybe 5’0ish.

Now I can’t say for sure and I am working my way up to figuring out the best way to ask her but here are the facts and I’d love some input from others:

• My gym inside my house is in the room with the window directly facing the street, this is the window that is directly across from hers that I always catch her glancing from.

• Every other day I go for a run around the neighborhood, like clockwork for months every time I am rounding the corner to come home she always is in her front yard doing something.

• I once got a random knock at my door from her because a week went by where she “didn’t see me” and it’s because I was sick and dint workout that week. Whatever the case, this concerned her so she felt the need to come and check on me?

• I go to the same coffee shop 2-3x a week to work and I shit you not, the last 2 or so times that I went, shortly after…I’m talking minutes, she would walk in and sit directly across from me. 

Could all of this be a coincidence? Sure. Could this just be in my head and I am just making something out of nothing? Possible.

Regardless, I would love some outside opinions and would love to know if I am in fact overreacting here.

So, have you ever been lying awake at night, thinking about how you could turn that side hustle of yours into a **full-blown passive income machine**? I mean, who doesn’t want to make money while binge-watching their favorite shows in their pajamas? 🤷‍♂️

And here's the kicker—AI is here to help us do just that! Seriously, if you’re not thinking about how to harness the power of AI for your side hustles right now, you might just be missing a boat that’s about to sail! 🚀

**Let’s dive right in! Here are a few ways you can start putting AI to work for you:**

1. **Content Creation**:  
   - You can use AI tools like ChatGPT or Jasper to whip up articles, blogs, or even social media posts. When was the last time you spent hours staring at a blank page? With AI, you can have fresh ideas flowing in no time!

2. **Customer Service**:  
   - Implementing chatbots on your website can answer FAQs and guide customers through their purchasing journey. Your robot helper can work *24/7*—talk about having an employee that never sleeps! 😴

3. **Market Research**:  
   - AI can crunch numbers and analyze data way faster than you can say “spreadsheet.” Get insights into trends or customer preferences without spending hours combing through reports.

4. **Automation**:  
   - Tools like Zapier can connect your favorite apps and automate repetitive tasks. Imagine freeing up hours in your week for actual strategy thinking instead of the nitty-gritty admin stuff. 🙌

5. **Feedback and Improvement**:  
   - Set up AI to gather and analyze feedback from your customers. It’s like having a magic mirror that tells you what your customers really want—no more guessing games!

Ever thought about what a life without the constant hustle could feel like? Sometimes I catch myself dreaming about just waking up, sipping coffee, and seeing my bank account grow. What’s your dream scenario? 

And of course, it’s crucial to act now. 🕒 Don't wait until everyone has figured this out and you're left picking the leftovers. The opportunities are ripe for the picking—like fruit hanging just a hair out of reach.  What if you could seize the moment before the market gets too saturated? 

But hey, don't just throw your money into every shiny AI tool you see. **Choose what aligns with your business goals.** 

- What's your current side hustle? 
- Have you tried using AI in any aspect of it?

1. Morning check-ins with myself — just 2-3 minutes to notice how l'm feeling and set a small intention for the day

2. Romanticising everyday moments -  Scented Candle while working , making my coffee in a cute mug, dressing up for myself etc

3. Talking to an Al companion - surprisingly comforting when I just need to feel heard without pressure

 night skincare, a weekly café date with a good book, or cooking a ""fancy"" dinner for one

I’ve got a new NDIS client with 2 hours of support to cover  hand washing dishes, a short dog walk, pulling up the bed,taking in laundry and then a coffee/chat in the home.

Before I started I  asked the plan manager if 2 hours was enough time, but apparently that's the time the previous supports did. First day I went 10 mins over but didn’t charge as they wanted to talk while I worked, which is absolutely fine but it does slow things down. Yesterday I went 20 mins over and now I’m not sure what to do.

The client was really looking forward to the coffee/chat and we did have 15 mins to spare, but I felt like I couldn’t look at my watch or get up to leave without it turning into more conversation. I said a few times I had to go, and then they would bring up something else.

I’m already efficient and fast, but I don’t know how past workers did it all in 2 hours without either going over or cutting corners. I really enjoy supporting this client and think the social interaction is really important for them. 

I tried to be firm, and mentioned  if they want me to stay longer I can move things around, but I don’t think they understood.

So what would you do?

Do you bill the extra 15/20 mins?

Stick to 2 hours no matter what, and just have alarms set up and exit even if they are talking?

Or ask the plan manager to change the shift length?

She called out to the next client on her list and was surprised when a frog came in carrying an ashtray. ""Can I help you?"" she asked, very confused. 

""Sure,"" said the frog. ""I'd like $25,000 to start a coffee shop. I've emailed you plans for the building space, some of our drink and pastry ideas, and our pricing plan which you will find can make us quite profitable.""

""Oooookaaayyyyy,"" Patricia said, ""that's all fine and good, but do you have anything for collateral?""

and like a ruin—
both holy and crumbling in the same breath.

People come with candles,
with questions,
with their hands outstretched for blessings
I do not have the strength to give.

There are nights I want to unpeel my skin,
leave it folded on the chair,
and ask the mirror if I ever belonged
to this body at all.

There are mornings
where grief curls into my coffee,
where loneliness climbs into my lap like a stray animal,
demanding to be fed before I can even
open my mouth to pray.

I do not heal quietly.
I fracture loudly.
The walls remember every echo
of my collapse.

But here is the truth:
I have grown from the ache that tried to bury me.
I have worn the teeth of silence
like a crown.
I have learned to stand in the fire
and not apologize for the smoke.

If love does not come—
then let me be my own devotion.
If God does not answer—
then let my bones write scripture for themselves.

I am not healed.
But I am here.
And maybe that is enough,
to call this wreckage holy.

and like a ruin—
both holy and crumbling in the same breath.

People come with candles,
with questions,
with their hands outstretched for blessings
I do not have the strength to give.

There are nights I want to unpeel my skin,
leave it folded on the chair,
and ask the mirror if I ever belonged
to this body at all.

There are mornings
where grief curls into my coffee,
where loneliness climbs into my lap like a stray animal,
demanding to be fed before I can even
open my mouth to pray.

I do not heal quietly.
I fracture loudly.
The walls remember every echo
of my collapse.

But here is the truth:
I have grown from the ache that tried to bury me.
I have worn the teeth of silence
like a crown.
I have learned to stand in the fire
and not apologize for the smoke.

If love does not come—
then let me be my own devotion.
If God does not answer—
then let my bones write scripture for themselves.

I am not healed.
But I am here.
And maybe that is enough,
to call this wreckage holy.

*A Story of Eternal Love*

## Act I: The First Life (Ancient Times)

The crimson sun bleeds across the horizon as seventeen-year-old **YUBAU** cradles **VATMI** in his arms atop the forbidden hill. Below them stretches a field of beautiful but deadly nightshade - the very plants that have poisoned their bodies and sealed their fate.

They had come here knowing the consequence. Their families - the House of Light and the House of Shadow - had been enemies for a thousand years. Their bloodlines were cursed, destined to destroy each other upon contact like fire meeting ice. But love had made them brave, and desperate.

""Do you regret it?"" Vatmi whispers, her voice like silk against the evening breeze. Her fingers trace patterns on his chest, over his heart that beats slower now with each passing moment.

Yubau lifts her chin so their eyes meet - hers like liquid starlight, his like the depths of midnight. ""Never,"" he breathes, his thumb brushing away a tear that rolls down her cheek. ""I would choose you in every lifetime, even knowing it would end like this.""

She smiles through her tears. ""The stars are so beautiful tonight. Look how they dance for us.""

""Not as beautiful as you,"" he murmurs, pressing his forehead to hers. ""In all the heavens, in all the worlds, nothing could ever compare to you, my beloved.""

The poison weakens them, but their love burns brighter. Vatmi's hand finds his face, memorizing every line, every curve. ""Tell me again,"" she whispers. ""Tell me how much you love me.""

""I love you more than the moon loves the night,"" Yubau says, his voice breaking with emotion. ""More than flowers love the rain, more than the ocean loves the shore. I love you with every breath in my body, with every beat of my heart, with every fiber of my soul.""

""And I love you,"" she replies, her voice growing faint, ""beyond time, beyond death, beyond everything that exists or ever will exist. You are my heart, my soul, my everything.""

As the poison spreads through their bodies, Vatmi begins to panic. ""Yubau, what if we can't find each other? What if this is truly the end?""

He holds her tighter, his own fear threatening to overwhelm him. ""Look at me, my love. Look into my eyes."" When she does, he sees eternity reflected there. ""We are written in the stars themselves. Death cannot separate souls that are meant to be one.""

""But how will we know?"" she gasps, her breathing becoming labored. ""How will we find each other in the vastness of forever?""

Through their fading vision, they see shooting stars streaking across the heavens. ""We'll call each other's names,"" Yubau says, kissing her forehead with infinite tenderness. ""Even in death, even in dreams, even when we've forgotten everything else. Our souls will remember the sound.""

""Promise me,"" she begs, her grip weakening in his hands.

""I promise, my eternal love. In every life, in every world, I will find you again. And you will find me.""

As the poison claims them, they whisper each other's names like a sacred prayer: ""Yubau, my beloved..."" ""Vatmi, my heart..."" The words echo across the hillside like music, carrying their souls toward the stars they had wished upon.

Their last breath leaves them as one, their bodies intertwined like the very constellations above, their love transcending death itself.

## Act II: The Endless Cycle (Modern Day)

### The Awakening - Year One

**DAVID CHEN** jolts awake in his cramped Beijing apartment, his heart racing from a dream that feels more real than his waking life. The remnants fade quickly - a girl's voice, soft and musical, calling a name that starts with 'Y.' He can never remember more than that.

At 25, he's a talented architect who designs buildings with inexplicable romantic details: balconies perfect for two, windows that frame sunsets, gardens filled with night-blooming flowers. His colleagues tease him about being a hopeless romantic, but David feels anything but romantic. Every relationship feels hollow, incomplete.

Meanwhile, in Shanghai, **MAYA LI** sits in her small apartment, staring at a poem she's written but doesn't remember writing:

*""In dreams I hear a voice calling,  
A name that starts with sorrow—  
Y... something beautiful, something lost,  
Someone I'll find tomorrow.""*

At 24, she owns a small flower shop where she unconsciously avoids nightshade and gravitates toward flowers that bloom in pairs. Customers often comment on how she arranges bouquets like she's reuniting lovers.

### The Subtle Awakening

**Maya's First Whisper**
During a busy afternoon arranging wedding flowers, Maya suddenly stops mid-motion. A customer is asking about centerpieces when Maya softly murmurs, ""Yu..."" 

""Excuse me?"" the bride-to-be asks.

Maya blinks, confused. ""I'm sorry, I thought I heard... never mind. These roses would be perfect for your tables.""

But the syllable stays with her. ""Yu."" It feels important, like the first note of a song she's forgotten.

**David's Growing Certainty**
David starts a sketchbook of fragments from his dreams. Page after page shows details he can't explain: a girl's silhouette against a sunset, hands intertwined under starlight, flowers that seem to glow with inner light. Beneath each sketch, he writes letters: ""V... A... T...""

His coworker JENNY finds the sketchbook. ""These are beautiful, David. Who's the mystery girl?""

David closes the book quickly. ""Just... someone I dream about.""

""You should find her,"" Jenny says kindly. ""Anyone who inspires art like this must be special.""

### The Cruel Relationships - Year One Through Five

**Maya's Heartbreaks**

*Year One - MARCUS the Charmer*
Marcus sweeps Maya off her feet with grand gestures and expensive gifts. But beneath the charm lurks possessiveness that grows like poison ivy.

""You don't need that flower shop,"" he says six months in, his hand gripping her wrist too tightly. ""I can take care of you. You just need to do what I say.""

Maya tries to pull away. ""Marcus, you're hurting me.""

""Good girls don't pull away from their boyfriends,"" he snarls, his grip tightening.

That night, Maya calls her best friend LILY, sobbing. ""I thought he loved me, but love isn't supposed to hurt like this.""

""Leave him,"" Lily begs. ""Please, Maya. You deserve so much better.""

But Maya feels trapped, isolated. Marcus has systematically cut her off from friends and family. On their one-year anniversary, as he raises his hand to strike her for ""disrespecting"" him, Maya closes her eyes in terror.

She opens them in her graduation gown, walking across a university stage. Marcus never existed. The trauma fades like a bad dream, but the scar on her soul remains.

*Year Two - ALEX the Artist*
Alex seems different - sensitive, creative, understanding. He paints Maya's portrait, calling her his muse. For months, she feels cherished.

But when his art doesn't sell, Alex's love turns bitter. ""You're my curse,"" he screams after another rejection letter. ""Everything was fine before you came into my life!""

He destroys the paintings of her, each rip of the canvas like a wound in her heart. ""I gave you everything,"" Maya whispers, tears streaming down her face. ""I believed in you when no one else did.""

""Your belief is worthless!"" Alex shouts, grabbing her shoulders. ""You're worthless!""

As their anniversary approaches, Maya finds herself saying a name in her sleep: ""Yub..."" Alex hears her and accuses her of cheating. The cycle resets as his jealousy reaches its peak.

*Year Three - KEVIN the Doctor*
Kevin is everything Maya's friends tell her she should want - stable, successful, kind. But even as he proposes marriage, Maya feels like she's drowning.

""I love you,"" Kevin says earnestly, holding her hands. ""We'll have a perfect life together. Two kids, a house in the suburbs, everything planned out.""

Maya stares at the ring, beautiful and suffocating. ""I... I need time to think.""

""Think about what?"" Kevin's voice grows cold. ""I'm offering you security, Maya. Most women would be grateful.""

But grateful isn't love, and Maya realizes she's trying to force feelings that simply aren't there. As the year mark approaches, she finds herself sketching a face she's never seen - strong jawline, kind eyes, features that feel like home.

**David's Distant Relationships**

*Year One - SARAH the Teacher*
Sarah is everything David should want - intelligent, compassionate, patient with his emotional distance. But even as she shares her deepest dreams with him, David feels like he's watching their relationship through glass.

""I love you,"" Sarah whispers one evening, her head on his chest. ""But sometimes I feel like you're not really here with me. Like part of you is somewhere else.""

David's heart breaks for her because she's right, and he doesn't understand why. ""I'm sorry,"" he says, stroking her hair. ""I wish I could be the man you deserve.""

""Where do you go when you look out the window like that?"" she asks. ""What are you looking for?""

""I don't know,"" David admits, and it's the most honest thing he's ever said. ""But I can't stop looking.""

*Year Two - ANNA the Designer*
Anna understands David's artistic nature. She doesn't demand explanations for his sketch-filled notebooks or question why he sometimes calls out names in his sleep.

""You dream about her again?"" Anna asks gently one morning, seeing the tears on his cheeks.

""I can't see her face clearly,"" David confesses. ""But when I wake up, it feels like someone ripped my heart out. Like I've lost something precious.""

Anna holds him, her own heart breaking. ""Maybe you should try to find her. The girl from your dreams.""

""How do you find someone who might not exist?"" David asks desperately.

But Anna knows she's fighting a losing battle against a ghost. When their relationship resets, she's almost relieved.

*Year Three - MICHELLE the Journalist*
Michelle tries to investigate David's dreams, thinking she can help solve the mystery. She researches reincarnation, past lives, soul mates.

""What if she's real?"" Michelle suggests excitedly. ""What if you're remembering a past life?""

David wants to believe, but doubt plagues him. ""What if I'm just broken? What if I'm incapable of loving anyone?""

""You're not broken,"" Michelle insists. ""You're just incomplete. There's a difference.""

But even her understanding can't bridge the gap in David's heart.

### Years Six Through Ten - The Pattern Deepens

**Maya's Growing Awareness**
By year six, Maya starts keeping a journal of her dreams:

*""The name is getting clearer. Yu-ba... something. And I see hands - strong, gentle hands that feel like they belong with mine. Why do I feel like I'm waiting for someone I've never met?""*

*Year Seven*: ""Had coffee with a new guy today. Nice smile, good job, everything perfect on paper. But when he laughed, I found myself listening for a different laugh. One deeper, warmer. One I've never heard.""

*Year Eight*: ""Woke up crying again. The dream was so vivid - lying under stars, feeling completely loved. More loved than I've ever felt awake. Is this what I'm measuring everyone against? A dream?""

**David's Desperate Searches**
David begins actively searching for clues:

*Year Seven*: He starts visiting art galleries, looking for paintings that match his dreams. In a small gallery in Shanghai, he finds a landscape that makes his heart race - a hill at sunset, flowers in the foreground. The artist is unknown.

*Year Eight*: David hires a private investigator to look into reincarnation cases. The man thinks he's crazy but takes his money. No leads.

*Year Nine*: He creates an online blog called ""DreamingOfYou"" where he posts his sketches and asks if anyone recognizes the scenes. Hundreds respond, but none feel right.

### The Near Misses - Growing Closer

**First Near Miss - The Coffee Shop**
*Year Ten, Spring*
Maya decides to visit Beijing for a flower arranging conference. She stops at a small coffee shop three blocks from David's apartment.

David is there too, laptop open, sketching while waiting for his morning coffee. Maya sits two tables away, close enough to see his drawings if she looked. She's reading a book about past lives, underlining passages about soul recognition.

They both order at the same time. The barista mixes up their orders - David gets Maya's jasmine tea, Maya gets David's coffee.

""Excuse me,"" Maya says, tapping David's shoulder. ""I think you have my—""

David turns, and for a split second, they lock eyes. Time seems to pause. Both feel a jolt of recognition so powerful it's like lightning.

But the barista interrupts: ""Sorry about the mix-up! Here are your correct orders!""

The moment breaks. David blinks, confused. Maya shakes her head, wondering why her heart is racing.

""Thank you,"" she mumbles, taking her tea with trembling hands.

""No problem,"" David manages, his voice hoarse.

Maya sits back down, but she can't concentrate on her book. She keeps glancing at David's table, feeling drawn to him in a way that defies logic. David sketches furiously, his hand moving without conscious thought. When he looks down, he's drawn Maya's profile perfectly, though he never consciously studied her face.

Maya gets up to leave. As she passes David's table, she glimpses his sketch and gasps. It's her exact profile, down to the small scar on her chin from childhood.

""How did you—"" she begins, but David's phone rings loudly, breaking the moment. By the time he finishes the call, Maya is gone.

That night, both dream more vividly than ever. They're on the hill again, but the dream lasts longer. They hear each other's voices clearly: ""Yubau, my beloved..."" ""Vatmi, my heart...""

**Second Near Miss - The Hospital**
*Year Eleven, Summer*
Maya's friend Lily is in a Beijing hospital after a car accident. Maya rushes to visit her. David is there too - his sister just gave birth in the maternity ward.

They're in the same elevator. Maya, exhausted and emotional from worry about Lily, starts crying silently. David, riding the wave of joy from becoming an uncle, notices her distress.

""Are you okay?"" he asks gently, offering her tissues from his pocket.

Maya looks up, and again they feel that electric connection. ""My friend... she was in an accident. I'm scared.""

""I'm sure she'll be fine,"" David says softly. ""You being here means everything to her. Love has healing power.""

Maya nods, studying his face. There's something so familiar about his kindness. ""Thank you. That's... exactly what I needed to hear.""

The elevator stops at Maya's floor. As she exits, she turns back. ""What's your name?""

""David,"" he says, holding the elevator door open.

""I'm Maya."" She smiles through her tears. ""Thank you, David.""

As the elevator doors close, David slumps against the wall. The name ""Maya"" echoes in his mind like a bell he's been waiting his whole life to hear.

Maya walks down the hallway in a daze. The name ""David"" feels significant, but she can't place why. That night, she dreams of calling out ""Yubau"" and hearing ""David"" in response, as if the names are connected somehow.

**Third Near Miss - The Bookstore**
*Year Twelve, Autumn*
Both are in the same Shanghai bookstore, in the poetry section. Maya is looking for books about eternal love. David is researching books about dreams and past lives.

They reach for the same book - ""Love Beyond Lifetimes: Ancient Chinese Poetry."" Their hands touch as they both grab it.

The moment their skin makes contact, both are hit with a vision so powerful they nearly collapse: lying together under stars, hands intertwined just like this, whispering promises of forever.

""Oh my god,"" Maya gasps, jerking her hand back.

""Did you feel that too?"" David asks urgently, his eyes wide.

But before Maya can answer, a bookshelf between them falls over (knocked by another customer), creating chaos. By the time the mess is cleared, Maya has fled, terrified by the intensity of what she experienced.

David buys the book and finds a note tucked inside - Maya's bookmark with her first name written on it. He keeps it like a sacred relic.

That night, both have the most vivid dreams yet. They remember more of their first life - the families that kept them apart, the poison flowers, the promise they made. But upon waking, the memories fade, leaving only the certainty that they must find each other.

### Year Thirteen - The Names Become Clear

**Maya's Breakthrough**
Maya is arranging flowers for a traditional Chinese wedding when she suddenly stops. The bride is talking about fate and destiny, how her grandmother always said true lovers call to each other across time.

""What do you mean?"" Maya asks.

""Oh, it's just an old belief,"" the bride laughs. ""That souls recognize each other by name, even across lifetimes. My grandmother used to say that when you meet your true love, their real name - their soul name - will come to you in dreams.""

That night, Maya dreams more clearly than ever. She's seventeen again, dying in Yubau's arms. But this time, she remembers everything - how they met in secret, how their families' ancient hatred made their love forbidden, how they chose death together rather than live apart.

She wakes with the name burning in her memory: ""YUBAU.""

**David's Recognition**
The same week, David is designing a memorial garden for a client who lost his wife. The old man shares stories of their love, how they promised to find each other in the next life.

""Do you believe in that?"" David asks. ""Past lives, eternal love?""

The old man's eyes grow distant. ""Son, when you love someone with your whole soul, death is just a pause, not an ending. She visits me in dreams, calls my name the same way she did when we were young. That's how I know she's waiting for me.""

That night, David's dream is complete. He remembers being Yubau, remembers Vatmi's face in perfect detail, remembers their promise. He wakes with tears streaming down his face and a name on his lips: ""VATMI.""

### The Active Search

**Maya's Quest**
Maya becomes obsessed with finding Yubau. She knows logically that no one has that name in modern times, but her soul insists he exists. She creates social media accounts, posts in reincarnation forums, even consults with spiritual advisors.

One elderly woman tells her: ""Ancient names often change in new lifetimes, but the soul essence remains. Look for someone whose modern name connects to the ancient one.""

Maya starts researching names similar to Yubau. She finds David's blog ""DreamingOfYou"" and recognizes every sketch, every detail. But it's signed only with initials: D.C.

**David's Discovery**
David hires linguists to help him understand the name Vatmi. They tell him it could be related to modern names like Victoria, Valentina, or Maya.

Maya. The name from the elevator, from the bookstore. David's heart races as he remembers the girl who touched his hand, who looked at him like she was seeing a ghost.

He starts searching for Maya Li in Shanghai, focusing on the area near where they met.

### Year Thirteen, Winter - The Final Search

**The Website**
David creates ""FindingVatmi.com,"" posting everything - his dreams, his sketches, his memories of their encounters. He includes a photo of himself and writes:

*""I'm looking for a woman named Maya Li. We've met three times in Shanghai and Beijing. Each time, I felt like I was remembering someone I've loved for lifetimes. If you're reading this, if you've dreamed of a man named Yubau, if you feel like you're waiting for someone you've never met - please contact me. I think we promised to find each other, and I'm ready to keep that promise.""*

**Maya's Discovery**
Maya finds the website through a past-life regression forum. When she sees David's photo, she collapses. It's him - the man from the coffee shop, the elevator, the bookstore. The face she's been sketching without realizing.

But more than that, she recognizes his soul. This is Yubau, her eternal love, wearing a different face but with the same kind eyes, the same gentle smile.

With trembling hands, she writes to him:

*""David - My name is Maya Li. I think we've been looking for each other for thirteen lifetimes. I remember the hill, the flowers, the promise we made. I remember you calling me Vatmi as we lay under the stars. I remember choosing love over everything else, even life itself. If you're truly Yubau, meet me where we first touched in this life - the coffee shop on Nanluoguxiang. I'll be wearing a white dress and carrying jasmine flowers. I'll wait for you as long as it takes.""*

## Act III: The Reunion

### The Meeting
David arrives at the coffee shop an hour early, his hands shaking as he orders tea. He's brought a single red rose - in their past life, Vatmi loved roses above all other flowers.

When Maya walks in, wearing a flowing white dress and carrying jasmine, time stops. Every sound fades to silence. The busy café seems to empty, leaving only the two of them in the universe.

Their eyes meet across the room, and suddenly, they remember everything - not just their past life as Yubau and Vatmi, but hundreds of other lives. They see themselves as star-crossed lovers in ancient China, as separated sweethearts during wars, as soulmates divided by oceans and circumstances. In every incarnation, they loved and lost each other, always searching, always hoping.

""Yubau,"" Maya breathes, tears streaming down her face.

""Vatmi,"" David whispers, rising from his chair on unsteady legs.

They walk toward each other as if in a dream. Other customers notice the charged atmosphere, how the very air seems to shimmer around them.

When their hands touch, the café seems to blur and shift. For a moment, they're back on that hillside, young and dying, making their eternal promise. Then they're here, now, alive and whole and finally, finally together.

""I told you I'd find you,"" David says, his voice thick with thirteen lifetimes of emotion.

""You kept your promise,"" Maya sobs, falling into his arms. ""You kept our promise.""

They hold each other as if they'll never let go again, crying tears of joy and relief and overwhelming love. Around them, other customers stop their conversations, moved by witnessing something sacred and eternal.

### The Test - The Final Reset

But their reunion triggers one final, cruel test. As they hold each other, both feel the familiar tug of the reset approaching. The world around them begins to shimmer and fade.

Maya's eyes widen in horror. ""No, not now. Not when we've just found each other.""

""I won't let it happen,"" David says fiercely, gripping her tighter. ""I won't lose you again.""

But the reset is stronger than their will. They feel themselves being pulled apart by forces beyond their control.

""If we wake up and forget again—"" Maya starts to panic.

""We won't,"" David interrupts, cupping her face in his hands. ""We've broken the pattern by finding each other. We've completed the cycle.""

""How do you know?""

""Because this feels different. This feels final.""

As the world dissolves around them, they kiss with desperate passion, pouring thirteen lifetimes of love into a single moment. They whisper each other's names - both old and new - like an incantation against forgetting.

""Yubau, my beloved...""
""Vatmi, my heart...""
""David, my soul...""
""Maya, my forever...""

The reset takes them, but this time, they don't fight it. They surrender to it together, trusting in the love that has sustained them across centuries.

### The New Beginning

Maya awakens not in her old apartment, but in a bedroom filled with morning sunlight streaming through windows she's never seen before. The walls are covered with David's sketches - but now they're complete, showing both their faces clearly, showing their life together.

Confused but not afraid, she follows the sound of humming from the kitchen. David is there making breakfast, wearing a wedding ring that matches the one now on her finger.

""Good morning, my love,"" he says, turning to kiss her forehead as naturally as breathing. ""How did you sleep?""

Maya's memories flood back - not just of their past lives, but of this life. Their real life. Meeting in college, falling in love instantly, dating for three years, their beautiful wedding by the lake, their first apartment, their dreams for the future.

The cycles, the painful relationships, the endless searching - it had all been a test, a trial their souls had to endure until they were ready to recognize and accept their eternal bond.

""I dreamed we had to find each other,"" Maya says, touching his face with wonder.

""We did find each other,"" David smiles, pulling her close. ""We always do.""

### Epilogue - Forever Realized

Outside their window, a garden blooms with every flower except nightshade. In its place grow jasmine and roses, peonies and cherry blossoms - symbols of eternal love in Chinese culture.

On their kitchen table lies a photo from their wedding day, but in the background, barely visible, is the hill from their first life. They had chosen it as their venue without understanding why it felt so significant.

As they hold each other in the morning light, Maya notices David's latest sketch on the counter. It shows two figures lying under stars, young and eternal, with words written beneath: ""Love promised forever, love delivered eternal.""

""Do you think we'll remember this time?"" Maya asks. ""If we have other lives?""

David considers this, then kisses the top of her head. ""I think we've learned what we needed to learn. How to fight for love, how to recognize it, how to trust it even when everything else falls apart.""

""And what's that?""

""That some promises are stronger than death, deeper than memory, and more persistent than time itself.""

A gentle breeze carries the faint sound of their voices from that long-ago hillside: ""In every life, in every world, I will find you again.""

The promise, at last, fulfilled. The cycle, finally complete. Their love, truly eternal.

**THE END**

Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.“Just a few spots to sign.”Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.But he hadn’t come back alone.My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.’I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.”I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’My throat tightened painfully.My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.Firm. Bold. Unwavering.Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.‘We do’, I agreed.Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.I hit send without hesitation.The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing — something Amelia would never allow.Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.I had my dignity.After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.“Come in,” I said.Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.“Luna Olivia,” he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. “Alpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.”Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set — necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.Disgust crawled up my throat.“Alpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.” Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.“How thoughtful of him,” I said. “Even with his busy schedule and all” I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.Reed flinched slightly. “I should get back,” He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights.My stomach twisted in disgust.Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I’d just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that’s what it felt like.By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.My eyes narrowed instinctively.That’s when I spotted Ethan’s car, parked near the exit.Through the window, I caught a glimpse—Ethan, sitting in the back seat.And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn’t have a care in the world.Reed was behind the wheel.The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.For a heartbeat, everything went still.My eyes locked with Ethan’s through the glass.Chapter 2Olivia’s POVI recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan — it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.She didn’t even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn’t stop her.I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.I hadn’t been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace — something simple to go with tomorrow’s blazer — when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.I didn’t need to look to know who it was.A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.I didn’t turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.“Are you upset?” he asked.“Obviously,” I said, still not looking at him. “You should be careful next time.”He didn’t respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. “The Windsor pack’s Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I’ve been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.”I nodded slightly and turned to face him. “So to secure the alliance, it’s necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?”His jaw flexed. He didn’t answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn’t expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.“I'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.”I stared at him for a second.“You don’t need to explain anything to me,” I said. “If you’re tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I’ll leave.”His face darkened. “What did you just say?”I didn’t flinch. “I said we can get a divorce and break the bond.”I stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.“Don’t ever say that again,” he said, voice low.I didn’t respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.But inside, I already knew — I wasn’t saying it for effect.I’d been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn’t want him anymore.Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha’s private office most of the evening, didn’t eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn’t close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman’s voice on the other end — crying.The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava — a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole’s latest post.It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: “Enjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.”I stared at the photo.One of those hands was Ethan’s. I’d know that scar near his thumb anywhere.I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.The following days, Ethan didn’t return home.At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn’t go upstairs to his office, and he didn’t come down to mine.In the evenings, I started browsing house listings — somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn’t mean anything to me anymore.One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar—I'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.I almost said no. But then I remembered — if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I’d have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.“Sure,” I texted back.When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.“Glad to see you Olivia,” she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.“Me too,” I tried to fake smile.She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.There were people on the other side — laughing, drinking, talking loud — but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan’s circle. She smiled at me — tight, awkward.I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.My name.From the other side of the screen.“She hasn’t been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?”“Well, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.”“She’s the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she’s a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.”“Still, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what — eight years? He’s probably tired of her even though they are mates.”There was a pause. Then a chuckle.“Shame. She wasted her best years. I’d still take a go at her, though.”The cup froze in my hand.I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.The laughter faded when they saw me.I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who’d spoken last.“Isn’t it a bit unfair?” I asked. “You make it sound like I’ve been living off him.”They blinked.I took a sip.“Ethan was a virgin before we got together. So if I’ve been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying — sounds like I got the better deal, doesn’t it?Silence. The whole room had gone still.Most of them just stared— and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.Chapter 3Olivia’s POVI smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.Alpha Ethan.I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me —her eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim — made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.That’s when it clicked.This wasn’t some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle — people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn’t their first. They didn’t even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.Ethan walked toward me.Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. “Olivia, we were just messing around—none of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.”Another added, “Really sorry. We didn’t mean anything by it.”I didn’t respond.Ethan reached for my wrist.“Let’s go,” he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.I didn’t fight.Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.I smiled faintly, “Please, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won’t interrupt again.”Then I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.His grip only tightened.His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.I kicked instinctively. “Ethan—put me down!”He didn’t respond.We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn’t loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands — each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up — and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.Sharp and captivating.They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan’s shoulder like some helpless object.Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.I didn’t know why I felt that way. But I didn’t like it. It unsettled me.Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.Then he finally spoke. “Why were you there? You came to catch me, didn’t you?”As he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.A foil wrapper — gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.A condom.The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.“I’m not staying in this car,” I said.He pulled me back roughly. “Where do you think you’re going?”“Home,” I said, my breathing uneven. “I want to go home.”“Stop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.”I didn’t answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.“Harold!” Ethan called out toward the club. “Drive.”Harold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.Only then did I feel something close to normal.When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn’t ask why.I sat down across from him.It was quiet for a while. Then he said, “I was there to talk business. A new project.”I said nothing.“You showing up and making a scene like that — it embarrassed me.”He kept going. “You looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.”I stared at him.He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.“Is that all?” I asked.His brows drew together. “If you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don’t have time for your insane suspicions.”I nodded. “Got it. Anything else?”He stared at me. “Do you know how annoying you are right now?”I stood up slowly.He won’t be annoyed much longer.I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn’t touch.That didn’t stop him.He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.By morning, I hadn’t slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself — toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn’t say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.He leaned in close to my ear.“This weekend,” he said gently, “let’s go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.”I took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. “Hmm.”That was it.On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to Washington for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.I wasn’t surprised. I didn’t feel anything — no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.Maybe he hasn’t noticed we haven’t shared a meal in weeks. We don’t talk. We don’t go anywhere. We don’t spend time like people in a marriage — not even like people who live under the same roof.He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn’t exist to him.If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.Melina.I hesitated, then picked up. “Hello, Luna Melina.” Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.She snorted arrogantly. “Come over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.”I paused. “Is that really necessary?”She didn’t hesitate. “If I say so.”""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""Chapter 4Olivia’s POVI arrived atHawthorne Manoraround 11 AM.As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.“Yay! I won again!” The girl’s tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. “Are you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?”I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn’t need to see her to know who it was.Chole Windsor.I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.I took a slow breath, letting Yve’s quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. “What are you doing here?”I walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn’t bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,“Your mom didn’t tel you? She called me.” I continued, “Didn’t know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?”His jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn’t respond.Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.“Hi,” she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. “I’m Chole Windsor. It’s nice to meet you.”I looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.“Chole, darling,” she said, taking Chole’s hand in both of hers,“I hope you’re having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.”I felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.Melina’s eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.“Ah, Olivia. You’re here.”She turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.“This is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She’s here on business.”It took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son’s wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn’t even try to defend my position.“Didn’t you say we had business to discuss? Let’s get it over with.”Melina’s smile tightened slightly.“We can discuss it another day. You’re here now, so why not join us for a meal?”I exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.“I’m not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.”I turned to leave, my back already to them.Her voice sharpened,“I am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.”I paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.“Fine. I’ll stay for a meal.”I met her gaze without blinking.“Just make sure you don’t regret it.”Chole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,“Oh, that’s perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I’d love to keep playing.”I glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn’t even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new — probably Chole’s idea.Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple — players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.Chole’s eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.“Oh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?”I met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.“Only a little,”I replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.“Wanna play?”Ethan’s jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.“Of course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?” Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.“Go ahead. I’ll watch.” I stepped back, casually folding my arms.Chole’s smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.She turned back to me,“Almost nailed it.”Behind her, Melina’s eyes followed the ring,“Chole. So graceful.”Chole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.I didn’t bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.Chole’s smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.“Lucky shot.”I let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.“Maybe.”I shrugged,“Last time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.”The remark hit its mark. Chole’s face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.Melina stepped in quickly,“Dear, it’s just a game. The important thing is to have fun.”I shrugged, stepping back.“Of course. But some people get carried away too easily.”I didn’t miss the way Melina’s eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around theMoon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole’s throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.Melina’s expression grew more strained with each missed attempt, her jaw clenching tighter every time I hit my mark. She glanced at Ethan, as if hoping for some intervention, but he remained silent.I stepped back, dusted my hands lightly, then walked to the nearby sofa. I set my final ring down on the polished side table, folding my hands neatly in my lap, my eyes meeting theirs without flinching.“Want to keep playing?”I asked, my tone light, almost bored.Chole’s hand curled tightly around the last ring, her knuckles turning pale, lips pressed into a thin, strained line.Melina shot me a sharp, furious look, her eyes narrowing into thin, dangerous slits.Chapter 5Olivia’s POV“Come on, one more,”Chole said, trying to hide the frustration in her eyes.“I’m just getting warmed up.”I glanced at her, then at Ethan, who still hadn’t said a word. Melina watched from the side, clearly annoyed but not stepping in.“Sure,”I replied, picking up another ring, my tone casual.“Let’s keep going.”We kept playing. I hit the pillar again. And again. Chole’s throws grew wilder, her aim less precise, her confidence visibly cracking. Melina’s eyes darted between us, her polished exterior slipping as her face twisted into an increasingly sour expression. She glanced at Ethan, clearly expecting him to intervene, but he just stood there.I picked up my final ring, tossed it with a casual flick of my wrist, and it spun neatly around theMoon Pillaronce more.Chole’s forced smile finally shattered. Her eyes filled with tears, and a small, broken sound escaped her throat. ",1,1755316749.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

By the time I got my shoes off, “Mi Amore” was already heading upstairs for the bedroom. “Gotta be up at midnight,” she said over her shoulder. “Don’t keep Koegalie up too late.”

“Yeah,” I said, but she was halfway up the stairs before I finished.

It had been a tense couple of months. Despite us having good jobs we still couldn't do the things we dreamed of. I tried to say I love you but with Aaron in the room the words seemed to just…die.

I stood in the kitchen for a second, weighing my options. My head still wasn’t right, but the beer in the heavy bag I brought home was calling my name. I grabbed one, cracked it open, and took the first long swallow with that guilty, satisfying hiss in my ears.

Aaron was Koegalie's couch, legs stretched out, scrolling his phone like it was the only thing in the world. He didn’t say anything, just nodded once without looking up. I sat on the other couch — my couch — and half-watched the 10 volume TV while doom scrolling the recent news reels.

Koegalie padded in a few minutes later, making airplane noises and dragging a toy car along the wall. “Shush,” I said, pointing towards upstairs. “Quiet time, Mama’s sleeping.”

He grinned, those little chuckles bubbling up in his chest, and plopped down next to me instead of his usual spot. Aaron didn’t look up, didn’t say anything. Just kept scrolling.

Time moved the way it does when you’re not paying attention — I glanced at the clock and it was already 8:00PM. Bedtime. My usual quiet time.

“C’mon, kid,” I said, pushing myself up. “Story time.”

Up in his room, he picked some random marvel book with lots of pictures and few words and  I read it emphatically, the way his mother couldn’t do. Its strange how a fathers voice puts so much weight on little words. Only recently he let me read to him. This time he was more emphatic about it. He really, REALLY wanted ME to read it. We read it slowly, his head heavy on my arm, his eyes half-lidded by the end. The first time he has ever done this. Usually its a few lines and then “Where is mommy? Is she sleeping?” but this time, my arm was numb. I tucked him in, turned on his nightlight, and crept back down stairs to the living room.

Beer number two. The can popped and hissed and Aaron finally looked at me. “Mind if I have one?”

I hesitated. I usually drink four. This was my second. Giving him one meant… what? stretching them? Ending early? I nodded and grabbed one from the bag anyway, handing it over.

He cracked it, took one sip, and went right back to his phone.

By the time I was at the end of my third, his was still three quarters full, sweating on the coffee table. He looked up again, just for a moment, like he’d been thinking about saying something for a while.

“You ever think about… quitting?” he asked.

I didn’t answer right away.

“You’re good at it,” he added. “Drinking, I mean. But I wonder… how much of you is in there, and how much is the can?”

“My can?” I replied not really listening, pretending to watch the still on screen cartoon my kid was watching, just wondering when this guy would go to bed. 

“No,” He chuckled and finally took another swig as I popped open my third...and last. “How much is left in you” 

I didn’t know how to respond. My first knee jerk response was “Not a lot.” but i didn’t want to cross that road, not only in my own mind as i drank to forget that thought and certainly did not want to cross that thought with a stranger. 

I took another drink instead of answering. The bubbles burned going down, and the silence between us was thicker than it had any right to be.

Aaron didn’t look away this time. His eyes stayed on me, not sharp exactly… but patient. Like he had all night to wait for whatever I might say.

I let the TV’s flicker be my excuse not to meet his gaze. Somewhere in the cartoon, a laugh track rolled — fake laughter for fake people.

He spoke again, softer. “You know, most people don’t even think about it. They just drink.” I glanced at him. “And what about you?” “I notice things,” he said. Then, without blinking, “Like how you keep your beers in a bag instead of a fridge. Not even worth putting them in cold if they still go down cold.”

That made me pause.

I tried to play it off. “I just have a routine. Drink, relax, have a bit of dinner, go to bed, wake up and work. Don’t we all have routines?” “Maybe,” he said, and went back to his phone. But I could feel it — the weight of him still *there*, still watching without looking.

The room felt smaller after that. Every tick of the cuckoo clock came through like a tap on the inside of my skull.

Then, far off at first, a siren began to rise. Not a short burst — a long, steady wail that climbed in pitch until it got my attention.

Aaron didn’t move. Didn’t even flinch. “You hear that?” I asked. He smiled — small, almost polite. “Yeah.”

The sound got louder. A second siren joined it. Then a third.

That was when I realized it wasn’t moving past. It was *coming here*.



**Chapter Four – Shapes in the Lights**

The sirens still didn’t fade. They stacked. Three. Then four. Then more. A layered, rising wail that filled the air until the walls hummed with it.

Aaron stayed where he was, legs stretched out, phone in hand. I couldn’t tell if the glow on his face was from the screen or the red-and-blue bleeding through the blinds.

Then came the first set of flashing lights — red across the living room, blue across the kitchen, switching places in a stuttering rhythm. My eyes kept trying to adjust, but it was like being in a nightclub for ghosts.

A horn blared. Deep, heavy. Not a car horn — something bigger. That’s when I caught shapes moving past the window. Quick, sharp silhouettes. Someone ran. Someone else followed, carrying something that sagged in their arms. A dog barked once and then went dead quiet, like someone had flipped a switch.

I stood up before I’d really decided to. Aaron didn’t ask where I was going. Didn’t even look up.

At the door, the sound doubled — the sirens, the horn, a new low thump like machinery winding up. I cracked the door just enough to see a wash of blue and red light cut across the street.

Fire trucks. An ambulance. Both idling in the middle of the road, their engines growling under the wails.

And behind them — soldiers. Or maybe just people dressed like soldiers. Helmets, rifles, body armor that caught the light. They weren’t shouting commands or rushing around. They were… walking. Steady. Deliberate.

Farther down the block, I saw the neighborhood gathering. At least two dozen people, maybe more. All standing too close together, faces turned toward the trucks. No one was talking. No one was moving. Every so often, I thought I saw them shift, all at once, like a school of fish.

I thought about calling out, asking what was going on, but my voice stuck somewhere between my chest and my throat.

Movement behind me. Aaron, stepping up just far enough to stand in the doorway’s shadow. He didn’t say anything, but I caught that same easy grin from the corner of my eye.

Aaron’s gaze stayed locked on me, not the blinding lights. It was the first time I really looked into his eyes — flat, emotionless. He slipped past me without a word, his shadow stretching long in the strobe of red and blue, and made his way toward the gathering down the block.

The crowd, still growing, joined hands. Even with Aaron in the middle, I could still see him in the glitter of white and blue — his eyes catching the light like two dull coins — staring right at me.

**Chapter Five – The Circle Closes**

The sirens cut off so suddenly my ears rang with the absence. No fade, no shift — just silence, and then… laughter. It rolled in like a tide, low and steady, until it swelled almost as loud as the sirens had been. Dozens of voices, perfectly in sync, too clean to be real.

I’d wandered farther from my door than I meant to. I was close now — only a few paces from the back row of the silent, staring crowd. The flashing lights from the trucks painted them in pulses, the reds and blues making their faces look waxy and pale. No one looked at me.

That was when the first pizza car rolled in. Round-bodied, oven-shaped, all glossy yellows and reds, with a giant cartoon face stretched too wide across the hood. Its smile was big enough to hurt just looking at it. Heat shimmered off the roof, and under the exhaust there was this smell — scorched dough, sauce too sweet, cheese cooked down into something that clung in your throat.

Another followed. Then another. Slow, unhurried. They slid into a wide circle around the gathering, wheels turning in a perfect, steady crawl. Four. Six. Eight of them now, surrounding the people without touching them, leaving no gaps in the ring.

The laughter swelled, but none of the people in the circle moved their lips. It was the cars. Every one of them laughing the same laugh, the sound washing over me like a hot wave.

One stopped just in front of me. A side hatch hissed open, warm orange light spilling out in a rectangle that painted my feet. The smell doubled — heavy, sweet, wrong. Something shifted in the light, too quick to catch detail. And then I heard it. My name. Not yelled. Not whispered. Just *there*.

Aaron was in the crowd now. I don’t know when he moved, but he stood almost at the edge, head turned toward me, hand making a slow “come here” motion.

I felt myself lean forward, like my weight was trying to pull me in. My foot hovered an inch off the ground. I could feel the heat from the open hatch on my shin.

And then— I stepped back.

The hatch shut with a wet *thunk*. The cars never stopped circling, but they closed the ring just enough that I couldn’t have slipped in now, even if I’d wanted to.

Aaron’s hand dropped to his side. His grin didn’t.



**Chapter Six – Why Did You Not Pizza With Us**

The laughter didn’t stop when the hatch closed — it shifted. Higher, tighter, a note of strain in the chorus, like something holding itself back.

Then I noticed the others. They were right there, scattered around me on the edge of the circle. Faces I recognized from the block. A neighbor who always smoked by her porch. A kid from two houses down with the mop of blonde hair. People I swear hadn’t been there a second ago. And there — Mi Amore. Koegalie. Both of them. Their faces lit by the spinning lights, pupils blown wide. My kid’s shoes were on the wrong feet.

They didn’t look at me. Not yet.

The laughter snapped to silence. In its place came the scrape of dozens of shoes pivoting at once. Everyone in the mob turned to face me. Every one of them now wearing the same bright blue shirt — the kind delivery drivers wear, but starched stiff, spotless. On the left breast, stitched in white: a little smiling slice of pizza.

And then they smiled. All of them. Too wide, too even. The ones around me seemed to suddenly snap out of it and instead of those blown out pupils, the faces of fear appeared.

Aaron stepped forward from the middle, the others making way for him without looking away from me. His grin didn’t change.

“Why,” he asked, voice syrup-slow, “did you not pizza with us?”

I opened my mouth but the words stuck, as if my tongue had been dipped in glue.

Someone in the crowd moved. The smoker lady — she stepped toward one of the pizza cars, and in a blink the side hatch snapped open and *pulled* her inside. The door slammed before she could scream, but her legs, now no longer with her body, twitched once on the pavement.

A kid — not mine — sprinted for the gap that was barley there before one of the laughing vans moved and crushed him at the knees. He was pinned and screaming, and the others were on him before the sound could carry. When they pulled back, there wasn’t anything left but the bright blue shirt, neatly folded where he was crushed, silently sitting on the car hood. On the bright blue shirt, seemingly glowing, was a poorly stitched sad face pizza slice, folded just right into the corner antimirroring the other happy pizza slices.

The laughter came back, louder than before, and it was *inside* my ears now, like someone had wired it directly into my skull.

My wife’s head tilted just slightly. Koegalie’s too. The fear on there faces now looking towards me for help.

Aaron took one more step toward me. “You don’t have to be hungry,” he said. “You just have to *say yes*.”

Behind him, another hatch hissed open. The heat spilled out, thicker than breath, smelling like burning dough and copper. This is no longer real. I shouted “Run!” and we all did.",1,1755316723.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1mrk0zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LushCosmetics/comments/1mrk0zy/layering_pumpkin_spice/,Layering Pumpkin Spice,"So I finally got Pumpkin Spice body spray today and I definitely see what people are saying about it smelling like a candle or poutpori or a the craft isle at Christmas. I was initially a little disappointed in it as it felt more like a smell than a fragrance? I did't strongly dislike it but didn't see myself wearing it at all. I did however, want to see how it layered with Cardamom Coffee and Turmeric Latte to see if that would get closer to that PSL experience (for reference I haven't smelled the shower gel yet). After some mixed results I found more and more I wanted to try it with and ended up discovering that while it's not my favorite on its own, it makes a fantastic layering scent! Here are some things I tried

Cardamom Coffee - Not what I expected at all, it really played up the bitterness in the coffee and I think this combo would require the addition of something else really sweet and lactonic or marshmallow-y 

Turmeric Latte- really nice and a fun twist, but there is already so much spice in Turmeric Latte that it sort of gets drown out.

Dear John - liked this a lot! The coffee note doesn't go terribly bitter and the lime is nicely amplified and I'm reminded a bit of a simmer pot or dried citrus garland

Honey I Washed the Kids - one of the most fun combos, it's giving Harvest Festival. I want to try this with something apple-y mixed in for caramel apple vibes

Sticky Dates - Great combo, but a little cloying. The two are really well matched in strength and intensity and play so nicely off each other- they really balance one another. Reminds of the pumpkin sauce they use for PSLs 

Let The Good Times Roll - Also really nicely balanced but not as heavy! Reminds me of cinnamon graham crackers

Sleepy/Twilight - a surprise love!! The spices and the tonka blend very nicely while the lavender elevates it all to something much more interesting. It feels slightly herbal but still sweet and fun. Like something Sabrina the Teenage Witch would wear. 

There's still so many combos I want to try with this! While I still don't know if I will get much wear out of Pumpkin Spice on its own, I think it's going to be a really fun one to play around with tthis Fall and im glad I got it. But also would recommend maybe start with the smal gift set if you're curious about the pumpkin stuff this year because it's definitely not going to be for everyone.

Any other combos you've tried or would like to try with this one?",1,1755316602.0,LushCosmetics,0,1.0,False

Context: Kumain kami ng 25F girlfriend ko sa restaurant, kaso nung magbabayad na kami for our orders narealize namin na wala pala kaming cash kaya we opt for Gcash payment. Medyo walang signal yung place at parehas kami ng GF ko na nag attempt mag bayad. Kaso dito ko sya medyo nataasan ng boses na umupo nalang muna kasi medyo na-annoyed na ko na nag fe-fail yung transaction. Alam ko din kasi na parehas lang kami ng Sim for data, at parehas din kami na BPI/Gcash ung ginagamit na app kaya para sakin kung mag fe-failed sakin ay malamang sa end din nya kasi baka ung mismong app na ung may problema. Nung medyo nawalan na ko ng pagasa bumalik naman ako sa kanya at tsaka ko na sinabi na i-try baka gagana sa kanya. Fast forward, meron palang card payment method dun sa resto at yun nalang ung ginamit namin pang bayad, ako na yung nag bayad ng buo sa lahat ng kinain namin.

Nung nakaupo na kami habang nag aantay sa order namin kinain ko muna yung mcdo na takeout namin, inalok ko sya para sana gusto ko sa kanya yung first bite pero ni-deny lang nya. After non alam ko naman na pero hindi lang ako sigurado na baka tampo sya, to make up with her sinabi ko na try nya icheck ung menu ng coffee shop sa tapat thru web para dun nya nalang ako ilibre. Naisip ko na kasi at this point na baka nagtampo sya kasi di ko na appreciate na gusto nya mag ambag sa pagkain namin/tumulong. 

Nakita ko naman na chineck nya pero wala na syang sinabi sakin, at hanggang dumating ung order namin nag cellphone nalang din sya kaya ako nag cellphone nalang din ako kasi nainis nadin ako. Dumating na ung order at agad ko nalang kinain, tumitingin na sya sakin non pero wala na, masyado na akong nainis at hindi na ko umimik at inilagan ko na ung tingin nya.

Natapos ako kumain, inantay ko din sya makatapos tsaka ko sya inaya na tara na umuwi [may meeting pa kasi ako sa gabi]. Sinabi nya sakin na umuna na daw ako. Ako naman, lumabas ako dahil nainis nadin nga ako. Hindi ako umuwi, nakatayo lang ako sa labas at tinitingnan ko sya, eventually pumasok nadin ako sa loob at dun ko na sya nakita na naiyak. 

At this point alam ko na mali ko na, the reason kaya naging emotional din kasi sya ay everytime na nag aaway kami ay nag wa-walkout ako pero hindi naman ako umuuwi. 

Tanong lang, bago ba mangyari yung pag labas ko ng resto ay valid ba yung tampo ko at tama ako sa naramdaman ko? Akala ko kasi kilala na nya ko na ako madalas yung nagbabayad ng food tapos tsaka ako mag papalibre sa kanya ng drinks. Hindi ko din naman sinasadya na tumaas yung boses ko nung sinabi ko na umupo nalang sya pero ayun nga since nangyari na sinubukan ko naman buhayin ulit yung mood nung inalok ko sya ng mcdo at bag start ako ng topic na ilibre nya ko sa tapat na coffee shop.

Recently the last time i took it out the wheel bearing and hub exploded. Of course it was a few hours before we had to leave but we were returning the following weekend and I would look into it more. 

We got back up late Thursday night and then next morning my BIL has the whole hub off and comes over to talk to my MIL and saying, oh we need 2 hubs and mil says we're just going to replace the entire axle. As im sitting there drinking my coffee this conversation is happening. I was completely taken back by this. The fact that it was my boat and they were making decisions without even asking kinda of rubbed me the wrong way. 

Let me make this clear I am absolutely appreciative of them offering to work on it and even pay for it. Im not mad at them whatsoever. I love my inlaws and BIL's, they truly are great people. But I would never just start making decisions about some else's property without asking them.

Now here is where I need to know if I am the asshole.

I tell my wife when were alone that I was taken back by this, just like I stated above. She immediately got pissed off and defensive saying whats the big deal, there gonna fix it and pay for it. I start trying to say im not mad, i was caught off guard that she cuts me off and says well then dont leave it there and you wont have a problem. I flat out told her that i knew i shouldnt have said anything and that I was just trying to tell her how i felt.

Crack!   
  
My fiancé hit me.  
  
Three minutes ago, I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment, where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.  
  
Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.  
  
Then, Rhys slapped me across the face-hard.  
  
My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire.  
  
It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted, slowly piecing reality back together.  
  
""Are you f\*\*king insane?"" I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.  
  
Rhys's lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute.   
  
""It was just a mug with Catherine's face on it,"" he said, as if my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.  
  
""You have got to be f\*\*king kidding me."" I stared at him in disbelief, my ch\*\*t heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.  
  
For half a second-just half-something like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.  
  
""No, you're the insane one!"" he roared. ""I already agreed to marry you-what more do you want? Catherine's gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!""  
  
His voice trembled with anger. ""She was your sister! She had to leave because of you! And now you're jealous of her? You won't rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?""  
  
The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the s\*\*p.  
  
My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bl\*\*ding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.  
  
I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. ""It wasn't me. I never asked her to leave.""  
  
Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Catherine had left behind a letter.   
  
In it, she said she'd seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to ""let go,"" to ""let him be yours.""  
  
I don't think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it-she told everyone.  
  
No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame, forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.  
  
To my family, it was like I'd been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl-I should've been grateful.   
  
Even if Rhys had st\*\*bed me in the gut, they'd still find a way to excuse it.  
  
It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better I did than Catherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn't protect her fragile pride.  
  
The searing pain on my cheek intensified.  
  
My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat-anger, humiliation, resentment-rose in my throat.  
  
Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision. I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.  
  
I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.  
  
I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart.   
  
Whatever shred of dignity I had left-I couldn't let it be destroyed in front of this man.  
  
Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. ""Clean it up.""  
  
I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I'd heard him right.  
  
""You broke the mug. You clean up the pieces."" His voice was icy, absolute.  
  
He had to be insane.  
  
""No."" I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.  
  
His face tightened, jaw clenched. ""You sure you want to do this?""  
  
""Yes. I said no."" My eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching.  
  
If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.  
  
The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me.   
  
And beneath that fire, I saw something else-disbelief. The once docile little lamb had bared her fangs.  
  
He took a step closer, menace radiating from him. ""Last chance. If you don't obey me, then we-""  
  
""-are over,"" I finished for him, cold and final.  
  
Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still. He hadn't expected me to actually say it.  
  
While he was caught in that moment of confusion, I wrenched my arm free from his grip.   
  
The taste of freedom hadn't yet bloomed in my ch\*\*t when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.  
  
Now.  
  
I spun around without hesitation and raised my hand-sm\*\*k! A resounding s\*\*p landed hard across Rhys's handsome, arrogant face.  
  
The air froze again, thick with silence.  
  
My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce, unprecedented satisfaction.  
  
Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief-not from the pain, but from a world turned upside down.  
  
He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply.  
  
I lowered my hand, lifted my chin, and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile. ""Now we're even.""  
  
Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating h\*\*l.  
  
If I stayed even one more second, I would break down. I'd rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.  
  
Then-thud-I fell.  
  
High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.  
  
Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Bl\*\*d surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.  
  
I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking.  
  
Home. I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this. Away from him.  
  
Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building-only to slam into a wall of mu\*\*le and the in\*\*xicating scent of expensive cologne.  
  
I looked up-and saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room.   
  
He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off, wouldn't just ruin your life-he'd erase your entire existence.  
  
Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.  
  
For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair-my face flushed red instantly.   
  
I snapped myself back to reality.  
  
""Sorry,"" I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.  
  
Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.  
  
No keys.  
  
Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.  
  
Frustration and helplessness surged in my ch\*\*t. I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently. It didn't help-but I needed to let it out.   
  
Why did everyone always choose Catherine?! Hadn't I done enough?  
  
I collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.  
  
Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice-low, smooth, like black velvet-cut through the air behind me.  
  
""Your key.""  
  
Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?  
  
Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare-only to freeze.  
  
Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs-the one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.  
  
""Your key fell,"" he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. ""That's probably why you couldn't find it.""  
  
I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand, my face flushing so hot it could've lit a match.  
  
I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.  
  
It wasn't until my back hit the door that I realized-I hadn't even thanked him.  
  
Great job, Mira. You absolute id\*\*t.  
  
Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.  
  
He lived across from me?  
  
He must have just moved in. With a face like that-and that aura-there's no way I wouldn't have noticed before.  
  
Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You're seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the h\*\*l Rhys just put you through?  
  
No. Absolutely not. All men are tr\*\*h. Always.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat, reminding myself not to be so st\*\*id again.   
  
But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.  
  
I needed ice-for my racing pulse, and more urgently, for the stinging pain on my cheek.  
  
Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang, shrill and sharp.  
  
One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.  
  
Mom.  
  
I couldn't ignore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.  
  
The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air-cold and merciless.  
  
""Mira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now, or you're no longer our daughter!""  
  
I opened my mouth to explain, stunned-but she hung up before I could get a single word out.  
  
I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't earn even a sliver of their love?   
  
And Catherine-she never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect, precious jewel.  
  
Enough.  
  
I thought if I worked hard enough, my family, my fiancé-they would love me.  
  
But that's never going to happen.  
  
I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.  
  
I have to break off this engagement with Rhys-no matter the consequences.  
  
  
Chapter 2 Plan B  
For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.  
  
No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets, and the crushing weight of humiliation.  
  
That s\*\*p from Rhys wasn't just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a s\*\*p across my entire life-one steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing.   
  
It forced me awake. It made me look back on everything I'd ever done to make him notice me, everything I'd done for a fantasy called ""us"" that had never truly existed.  
  
God, where do I even begin?  
  
Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he'd once praised.   
  
My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, ""It's fine-some allergic reactions are worth it.""  
  
Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning how to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain.   
  
He didn't even open the door-just had the receptionist tell me, ""Don't bother next time. I don't like sweets.""  
  
Then there was that night at his friend's dinner party. I forced down oysters-my most hated food-just to seem ""graceful and agreeable.""   
  
I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m. He didn't ask if I was okay. He laughed and said, ""Can't even handle seafood? That's just dramatic.""  
  
But the worst?  
  
That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party.  
  
I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, ""Don't pretend to like things you clearly don't understand.""  
  
And I laughed. I laughed and said, ""You've got such a good memory.""  
  
What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.  
  
He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the ""perfect and untouchable"" Catherine. A cheap stand-in.  
  
I wasn't her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.  
  
I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook. Not because it was funny-but because the pain had gone too deep for tears.  
  
Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn't contacted me again.  
  
A small part of me wondered-did Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he'd done?  
  
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.  
  
And it didn't stop ringing.  
  
For a full five minutes.  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.  
  
Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.  
  
Yvaine Carlisle-my best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me-stood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.  
  
Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed. ""What the h\*\*l happened to you?""  
  
""I'm fine,"" I said, trying to sound casual. She wasn't buying it.  
  
She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.  
  
Then-silence.  
  
Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind. The kind that comes right before something explodes.  
  
""Who hit you?""  
  
""Come inside,"" I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors' attention. That would be mortifying.  
  
Yvaine didn't move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. ""Mira. Who. Hit. You?""  
  
As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.  
  
She didn't flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.  
  
I didn't know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.  
  
""Rhys.""  
  
Yvaine didn't move.  
  
Everyone in Skyline City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn't the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone.  
  
One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation, money, status-he had it all.  
  
Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection-like the ticking of a Rolex.   
  
When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Sc\*\*ch in hand.  
  
People called him arrogant. No one ever called him vi\*\*ent.  
  
That's why, when Yvaine processed what I'd just said, I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.  
  
""No way,"" she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. ""Rhys? Your Rhys? He couldn't have...""  
  
I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant, untouchable good guy.  
  
""It was him,"" I said quietly.  
  
She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. ""Tell me what happened.""  
  
I swallowed. ""I was at his place. I, uh... accidentally broke a mug.""  
  
Her entire body tensed. ""Just a mug?""  
  
I nodded.  
  
Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, ""I swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted, one-of-a-kind family heirloom-""  
  
""It was Catherine's mug.""  
  
Yvaine's hand froze mid-pat.  
  
Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting mu\*\*er.  
  
I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. ""It's over between Rhys and me.""  
  
""Really?""  
  
""Really. Even if the earth split in two and Skyline City sank into the ocean, I wouldn't marry him.""  
  
That stopped her from storming out to commit ho\*\*cide.  
  
""Catherine. That venomous snake-"" Yvaine spat the name like it physically hurt her.   
  
""She's not even here anymore and she's still managing to wreck your life! And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they'd hand her the matches. It's unbelievable!""  
  
I felt like a balloon someone had just popped-deflated, exhausted. That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my ch\*\*t.  
  
I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing I could do about it.  
  
""I'm sorry, Mira.""  
  
Yvaine sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile.   
  
""Actually, I think it's a good thing. At least I found out what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?""  
  
She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. ""Mira, you know no matter what happens, I've got your back.""  
  
Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.  
  
Like a magician, Yvaine reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you'd be like this.  
  
I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.  
  
After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed. What now?  
  
Through the half-open door, I heard her on the phone. I didn't catch every word, but the ones I did hear... were iconic.  
  
""A pile of s\*\*t.""  
  
""Total f\*\*king psycho.""  
  
""Oh, you think that's bad? Wait till I tell you what this vi\*\*ent ba\*\*ard actually did-""  
  
She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.  
  
The way Yvaine so instantly, so fiercely chose me-without hesitation, without question-made my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.  
  
This wasn't something she did lightly. Rhys's family sat at the very top of the food chain-untouchable. And I had no doubt her parents wouldn't be thrilled to see her go up against them.  
  
I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.  
  
Why couldn't my parents love me like that?  
  
Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini'd her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn't mean they forgave my existence.  
  
Let's be honest: the only reason they'd stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys.   
  
That little arrangement somehow elevated me from ""irreparable family di\*\*race"" to ""potential saving grace.""  
  
Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement-and I know how pathetic this sounds-was because I thought maybe I could finally get something Catherine had: a sliver of parental affection.   
  
A crumb of approval.  
  
But now that the engagement was off?  
  
I was disposable again.  
  
Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I'd spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.  
  
They were absolutely capable of that.  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my pillow. What the h\*\*l do I do now?  
  
Unless... I married someone more powerful than Rhys.  
  
The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Skyline City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.  
  
And yet-  
  
A face flashed in my mind.  
  
Three days ago. My new neighbor.  
  
I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking I wouldn't mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.  
  
I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought. I didn't even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.  
  
No. Way too dangerous.  
  
I gr\*\*ned again.  
  
If I hadn't broken that st\*\*id mug, everything might've been okay.  
  
But it wasn't. And it's not. And there's no going back.  
  
F\*\*k! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn't even the one who messed it up?! I sat up-and bam, the door burst open.  
  
Yvaine marched in. ""Sl\*\*p is just going to make you feel worse. We're getting up, and we're going to find a d\*\*k worth loving-one that's better than Rhys's.""  
  
WHAT?!  
  
While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.  
  
Just like that, we were off to Skyline City's most exclusive club-members only.  
  
  
Chapter 3 Rebound Night  
""Is this really necessary?"" I stood at the end of the line, shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt.   
  
I could practically feel it-if I opened my mouth to speak, my un\*\*rwear would be on full display.  
  
""Sweetheart, we paid a fortune to get into this place. Of course we're going all in. Do you not get it?""   
  
Yvaine declared like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.  
  
""But isn't this a little too-"" I didn't even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face like it had a personal vendetta.   
  
I immediately zipped up my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.  
  
Yvaine let out a dramatic gr\*\*an. ""Mira, come on. We're going to a b\*r, not an Arctic expedition.""  
  
""I'm just glad I won't be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks,"" I snapped back.  
  
She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out, gave me a once-over full of disappointment-but said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe-for now.  
  
I'd thought we'd have to wait in line like everyone else. That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Yvaine.  
  
She had zero plans to follow the rules.  
  
With the ease of someone who'd done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer's hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard ch\*\*t like a Bond girl who'd forgotten her martini.  
  
Ten seconds. That's all it took. We were in.  
  
Yvaine was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol-and ethics-in an instant.  
  
And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.  
  
The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of ch\*\*pagne.   
  
I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with an are-you-trying-to-embarrass-me glare from Yvaine.  
  
She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she'd personally hired the man. Regal, effortless, born for this.  
  
I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who'd just woken up from a freezer nap.  
  
Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels.  
  
If I hadn't known each co\*\*tail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might've even convinced myself I was pulling it off.  
  
""Jesus Christ!"" I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just in\*\*lted my entire bloodline.  
  
Yvaine gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. ""Relax. Tonight's on me.""  
  
I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude.  
  
Considering I'd nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.  
  
Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.  
  
It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones, wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.  
  
We found a table near the b\*r and hadn't even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.  
  
Well. He was hard to miss-tall, sculpted features, sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.  
  
He shouldn't be mixing drinks-he should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior's newest fragrance campaign.   
  
Maybe that's why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.  
  
""Two 75s, French br\*\*dy,"" Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Yvaine had already tossed her order at the ba\*\*ender. ""Make it strong.""  
  
And of course, she didn't forget to flash her signature smile-the one that balanced perfectly between s\*\*y and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say ""Oops, didn't mean to flirt.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender reached effortlessly for the g\*n, giving her a half-smile. ""Rough night?""  
  
""More like an engagement-level disaster,"" she said, casually pointing her thumb at me. ""And it's wrapping up real soon.""  
  
I glanced at her. ""Thrilled that my personal life is now public broadcast.""  
  
She patted my hand with mock sympathy. ""Sweetie, this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks.""  
  
Then she turned away and melted into the crowd, flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.  
  
In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep-like a hawk zeroing in on prey-before spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.  
  
""Okay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A: Six-foot-two, hair neater than your ex-fiancé's moral compass, shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream s\*\*y without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or, at the very least, a VIP card.""  
  
I shook my head. ""Nope.""  
  
Her eyes flicked to a new direction. ""Exhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn't happened yet, but he's hot enough you'd forgive him. You'd fund his next album and still sl\*\*p like a baby.""  
  
""Pass.""  
  
She sighed, then pointed again. ""Fine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes-but the good kind. Like 'books your doctor's appointment and your breakfast' dad, not 'calls the waitress 'sweetheart' and thinks climate change is a myth' dad.""  
  
I gr\*\*ned into my hands. ""Yvaine, please.""  
  
She didn't back down. ""Mira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds.""  
  
Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.  
  
Then, far too casually, she said, ""Hey, want to hit the bathroom?""  
  
I narrowed my eyes. ""No?""  
  
""...Or maybe let's move tables? The vibe here's weird."" Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.  
  
Weird vibe? We'd only been sitting for ten minutes, and we just ordered drinks. By Yvaine's standards, we hadn't even made it past the opening credits.  
  
Then I followed her gaze.  
  
A half-private booth.  
  
Rhys.  
  
He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.  
  
I didn't need more details.  
  
That face-I would never forget it.  
  
Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances.   
  
I, in all my na?ve glory, believed she had simply ""stepped aside,"" choosing to selflessly walk away from a future with Rhys.  
  
And now, here was Catherine-perched on my ex-fiancé's lap, locked in a pose so in\*\*mate.  
  
I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We'd broken up. It was done. Time to move on.  
  
Until I heard what came next.  
  
""Honestly, I didn't think she'd fall apart over a coffee mug.""  
  
Catherine's voice was soft, full of false pity-the kind that sounded like she'd just k\*\*led someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.  
  
She gently swirled the w\*\*e in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile.   
  
""Of course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice. After all, she still doesn't know you've been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint, wasn't it?""  
  
She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration.   
  
""Honestly though, darling, your performance was spot-on. Even I almost believed you were worried she'd find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene.""  
  
""She's so st\*\*id-of course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your af\*\*ir.""  
  
Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. ""I had to act like I cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn't compete with you, she'd lose it.""  
  
Catherine laughed under her breath and patted his ch\*\*t.  
  
""Don't worry. Knowing Mira, she's probably still scrambling to fix things. She's the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth.""  
  
Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a bl\*\*e.  
  
""But the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just 'happened' to return home. Her parents don't know a thing. They didn't even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I'll be seeing them in broad daylight-because she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless.""  
  
Catherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. ""Isn't this the best ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside.""  
  
Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. ""You're right. You always are.""  
  
A loud roar rang in my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.  
  
Yvaine must've been saying something-pleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything st\*\*id-but I didn't hear a word.  
  
I wasn't the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.  
  
I slipped free from Yvaine's grip and turned to the bartender. ""Your best red. Put it on Rhys Granger's tab.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender-bless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul-didn't even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I'd just ordered mineral water.  
  
With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular, burning purpose.  
  
The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face-like a vengeful goddess straight from h\*\*l-made him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.  
  
I marched straight toward Rhys and Catherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.  
  
I raised the bottle-and smashed it, with all my strength.  
  
Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys's forehead split instantly, a trail of bl\*\*d beginning to drip down between his brows.  
  
Catherine screamed and leapt off his lap. ""Mirabelle?! Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!""  
  
She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice. ""You're misunderstanding, it's not what you think-""  
  
Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm, his gaze dark and cold. ""Don't bother explaining, Catherine. It doesn't matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We're just correcting an old mistake.""  
  
Catherine's panic twisted into smugness in an instant. She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed, ""Oh, honey, your head's bl\*\*ding. We have to get to the hospital.""  
  
Before I could say anything, Yvaine rushed to my side, fury radiating from every pore.   
  
She raised her hand, ready to s\*\*p Catherine straight back to whatever pit she'd crawled out of. ""You disgusting, two-faced bi\*\*h-!""  
  
I grabbed her wrist, steady and cold. ""Yvaine, let them go. If they stay here one more second, I might lose my appetite permanently.""  
  
I locked eyes with Catherine's smug little face and raised my voice deliberately. ""After all, the theme of this place is premium taste, not some clearance aisle for secondhand tr\*\*h.""  
  
Catherine's smile froze on her lips. Rhys's face darkened, but they had no chance to respond.  
  
Yvaine, emboldened, lifted her chin and sneered at the bouncers. ""Well? What are you waiting for? Kindly es\*\*rt these two walking health code violations off the premises.""  
  
  
Chapter 4 Key Guy  
As soon as they were gone, Yvaine dragged me out of the club.  
  
D\*\*n it. I hated that Catherine had predicted every single thought running through my mind.  
  
Yes, I was still considering salvaging my relationship with Rhys.  
  
But now? The truth was right there, unmistakable and r\*w-they'd been sl\*\*ping together behind my back all along.   
  
And me? I was just the fo\*\*ish, unnecessary third wheel in their twisted little story.  
  
What I couldn't figure out was-why had Catherine faked her disappearance four years ago? What exactly had she been hiding? And why come back now?  
  
My eyes stung. I tilted my head toward the sky, forcing the tears back.  
  
Fine. Catherine's back. Perfect. Now they could all reunite like a happy little four-piece family?, and I... I was finally free.  
  
""Mira... I'm so sorry. I had no idea they'd be there tonight. I didn't even know Catherine was back."" Yvaine's eyes were full of regret.  
  
I gave a bitter laugh and shook my head. ""Neither did I. But I heard it loud and clear-they've been screwing around for a while. To them, I was just in the way.""  
  
""Those godd\*\*n as\*\*oles!"" Yvaine hissed through clenched teeth.   
  
""You should tell your parents. Let them know Catherine's not the perfect angel they think she is. What about Rhys's parents? No way they'll tolerate a scandal like this.  
  
I was quiet for a moment. Yvaine had a point-Rhys's parents were the only people who had supported me.   
  
But he was their son. They wouldn't choose me over him. Not in the end.  
  
And my parents? I let out a breath, heavy and tired. ""You know better than anyone-they only care about Catherine. No matter what I do, I'll never replace her.""  
  
Yvaine grabbed my shoulders, worry darkening her gaze. ""So what now? You're just going to let them humiliate you?""  
  
""Maybe."" My voice dropped to a whisper, a weariness weighing it down. ""Maybe if I accept it, it'll finally be over.""  
  
Suddenly, Yvaine's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her brows knitting in frustration.   
  
""Mira, my agent just called. There's a last-minute ad shoot-I have to go now. Can you get home on your own?""  
  
I nodded, managing a faint smile. ""Go. Don't worry about me. I'll call when I get back.""  
  
After she left, I hailed a cab. Instinctively, I gave the driver my home address. But barely two minutes into the ride, a wave of suffocating pressure settled over me.  
  
""No, wait,"" I said quickly. ""Take me to a b\*r. Any bar. Just... far away from Roxanne.""  
  
The driver didn't blink-clearly used to the erratic demands of Skyline City's broken-hearted.  
  
We eventually pulled up outside some unfamiliar ni\*\*tclub. Velvet ropes. A crowd of influencer-types wielding selfie sticks.   
  
I didn't bother checking the name. I handed the bouncer some bills and strode inside.  
  
Straight to the b\*r.  
  
""Wh\*\*key sour. Large. Keep them coming.""  
  
""Ma'am, maybe you should slow down,"" the ba\*\*ender said gently, concern in his voice.  
  
I slammed my empty glass on the counter and shoved my card across. ""Did I stutter? Top me off.""  
  
The ba\*\*ender sighed but obliged.  
  
""That guy's right,"" a smooth, magnetic voice murmured beside me.  
  
""Too much al\*\*hol can impair cognitive function and judgment. Unless you want to wake up in a stranger's b\*d tonight-""  
  
I turned, irritated-then froze.  
  
It was him.  
  
The man from last night. My new neighbor. The one who'd handed me my keys with all the casual elegance of a Renaissance statue.  
  
""Well, well. You again."" I raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at my lips. ""You really can't resist other people's business, huh?""  
  
He chuckled softly, completely unfazed. ""Think of it as a well-developed instinct for being helpful.""  
  
I gave an exaggerated sigh. ""You're a hero, truly. But I don't need saving, Mr. Key Man.""  
  
""I know,"" he said calmly, lifting his glass and taking a slow sip. His eyes were clear and sharp. ""But you do seem in desperate need of clarity.""  
  
I frowned. ""Is this how you treat all your neighbors? First their keys, then their dignity?""  
  
He laughed-a low, rich sound. ""Only when the neighbor looks like she's on the verge of self-destruction.""  
  
""...But I am always self-destructing,"" I muttered, suddenly quieter. ""Doesn't it seem kind of pathetic? Like my whole life is just one mess after another?""  
  
He didn't laugh. He didn't rush to reassure me, either. He didn't even deny what I'd just said.  
  
He just looked at me. Calm. Quiet. Like he was watching a slow-motion disaster unfold-but had no intention of stopping it.  
  
""You're not wrong,"" he finally said, his voice low and steady.   
  
""You are pretty good at making a mess of things. Like right now-you can't even stand properly and you're still demanding more al\*\*hol.""  
  
I froze, frowning instinctively.  
  
But he went on, his tone unhurried-like he was flipping through a book and had landed on a sentence he already knew by heart:  
  
""But strangely, you always seem to meet someone who refuses to walk away... right before everything falls apart.""  
  
I stared at him, half in shock, half in suspicion. ""Are you... fl\*\*ting with me?""  
  
He gave me a slow smile, his eyes lazily curving with just the right amount of mischief.   
  
His voice came out smooth and provocative, like velvet wrapped around steel. ""Does it make you feel any better?""  
  
His voice was low and warm, like wh\*\*key being poured into a glass at midnight-just a little dizzying, just a little dangerous.   
  
He looked at me with an intensity that felt nearly uncontrollable, like he might lean in close and whisper things in the dark, on a b\*d, asking if his to\*\*h was hard enough.  
  
My heart skipped a beat. My cheeks flushed instantly. My fingertips tightened against the edge of the b\*r.  
  
I had to look at him properly. Really see him.  
  
That face-it wasn't just handsome. It had the kind of quiet, devastating maturity that no amount of cologne and hair gel could fake.

* Sonim XP3plus: not the newest of the bunch (2021) but has significantly better hardware (2GB RAM + 16GB storage + up to 128GB expandable storage. i just hate how the lid is smaller than the main part of the phone, the visible screwholes on the front of the screen, and how 'old person phone'-ey the buttons on the keyboard are. 
* TCL Flip GO: has AOSP, is newer and therefore more readily available (2023), has up to 128GB expandable storage and 1GB RAM. is also ugly as sin and the only cases i could find for it have an even WORSE grid texture. better than the sonim only because you can change the wallpaper on the outer screen, which is the thing i miss most from [my first phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_cu500-pictures-1656.php). 
* Kyocera DuraXV Extreme+: the perfect middle of the road solution. it looks sufficiently edgy enough for me to not worry about it being mistaken for a jitterbug i borrowed from my grandmother, but still has all of the hardware functionality i need (2GB ram, a whole entire 512GB of expandable storage *what do you mean i could fit the entirety of my DVD/CD collection on this thing and still have space*). the only think that has me concerned is that the advertising on the website is very verizon-oriented, which makes me wary about it working with my mint SIM (and i'd REALLY rather not go back to verizon, if only because i'm still salty about losing my long-term user discount just for moving to a flip phone). 
* Kyocera KY-42C: most similar to my beloved 903KC that i am now unable to use in my area. it's significantly older than the others on the list, only supports up to 32GB of expandable storage, and having service to my 903KC vanish without warning has me really nervous about buying any non-US phones in general (which is irrational considering that it has the same band support as the aforementioned DuraXV). The significant price increase for the phone also has me a bit torn, as I'd be paying about $50 more than I would for the last phone on the list solely for aesthetics. 
* Kyocera KY-42C but red: all of the same previous bullet points, but the phone would be $100 more instead. do you know how many wawa coffees you can get with $100? 

anyways, word vomit over, TLDR: having to choose between buying an aesthetically unappealing phone that meets my needs vs buying a gorgeous phone that may or may not be supported, made myself miss my LG-CU500 in the process. can we just make a magical 6g that covers all towers?

Available in round,rectangular,and oval shapes,these tables cater to diverse spatial needs and preferences.

Black and walnut tables in 2025 come in a wide variety of sizes, from compact side tables measuring 20 inches in diameter and height to large dining tables capable of seating 8-10 people. Height options also vary to suit different purposes, from standard coffee table heights (16-18 inches) to counter-height tables (36 inches) and bar-height tables (42 inches). This range ensures there is a black and walnut table available for every room and purpose.

**Craftsmanship and Construction:** Meticulous craftsmanship is evident in the construction of the top-rated black and walnut tables.Quality joinery techniques, such as dovetail joints and mortise-and-tenon joints, ensure structural stability and prevent the table from wobbling or becoming misaligned over time. Attention to detail is paramount, with smooth edges, seamless transitions between materials, and a flawless finish that highlights the natural beauty of the walnut wood grain.Many manufacturers emphasize hand-crafted elements, adding a unique touch to each piece.

**Sustainability and Eco-friendliness:** In line with growing environmental awareness, many black and walnut tables in 2025 prioritize sustainability.

Some companies even partner with environmental organizations to offset their carbon footprint and support reforestation efforts.**Stability and Weight Capacity:** A well-designed table must be stable and capable of supporting a reasonable amount of weight.

1mrjhyj,https://i.redd.it/hhdonubxwajf1.jpeg,28 M --Colorado -- Looking for new connections.,"I moved to Colorado about 8 months ago (back in January) from the Santa Barbara area in California, and I’ve been trying to meet new people and make some real friends out here. It’s been a bit rough — Denver hasn’t felt as welcoming as I’d hoped, and between school and just adjusting to life here, I haven’t had a lot of time to explore or go out.

I’ve met up with a few people here and there, but honestly, it feels like a lot of connections fizzle out quickly or people lose interest. It’s been tough navigating that while coming from a genuine place — I moved out here on my own and don't know anyone here, so I’m really hoping to build some meaningful friendships.

A little about me:

* I’m into video games (mostly horror and shooters on PC)
* I love going to the movies
* Before school took over my life, I was big into reading and would actually love to find a queer book club if anyone knows of one
* I enjoy checking out new coffee shops and just hanging out and chatting

(im american, but i live in mexico) we went to get coffee, and walked around and sat down, and drank our coffee for about an hour and a half. we just talked and laughed, asking each other about ourselves. where he went to school, his hobbies, just typical first date questions. we hit it off pretty well. he told me how pretty i was, and that he loved my outfit. he then asked if i wanted to walk outside. the outside area is very nice at this particular mall, it was night time, and it was lit up very beautifully and had an outside seating area. we kept talking for about an hour.. and then he kept looking at me and smiling, and asked what i wanted to do. i jokingly said “why? do u want to kiss me?” although it wasn’t a joke, and i wanted to kiss him as well. he did a big smile and said “yes.” so we kissed, and made out for a while and he wrapped his arm around me, and we spent the rest of the time conversing and kissing. he said he really liked me a lot, and he kept saying that quite a bit. it was then time for me to go home, so we both ordered our ubers. he walked me to my uber, and we held hands on the way there. i kissed him goodbye, and told him to tell me when he got home. soo, i got home and sent him a text saying “hi, i made it home, let me know when ur home too. i look forward to seeing u next week” (we had planned to go out again the next week) he messaged me back and said he couldn’t wait to see me and that he had a great time. so we exchanged a few messages here and there. one night he even said “te quiero mucho” which is a way to say “i love you” in spanish, but not in a serious way. you more so use it for friends and maybe people you’ve just met, yet care about. the next week came around and i asked if he still wanted to go out. he said he’d have to see, as he didn’t have much money due to something personal. (i don’t wanna say here, im paranoid that he’ll see this lol) so i told him that was okay, and we could do something free. that was around 2 and a half weeks ago, and he hasn’t messaged me back or said anything since then. i haven’t messaged him either since that conversation. he goes to college, and he also kept telling me that he’s been really busy, but it’s been two weeks. did he just not like me as much as he said? did i do something wrong? idk if i should send another message, or just leave it be so i don’t bother him. i need advice. i really like him, and he’s exactly my type, he was funny, cute, and had a great style. i know we only went on one date, but i felt a great connection, and it’s hard for me to stop thinking about him. what should i do?

1mrj8xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1mrj8xu/harpers_ferry/,Harpers Ferry,"The waters at Harpers Ferry followed the roads and split three ways. One branch came in from the Shenandoah on the Virginia side, another curved down from the Potomac on the Maryland side, and here they met. For a while they grew as calm as a lake—calm enough to mirror upside down the blue ridgelines and the black seams of old oaks—then slid south, and farther south, tracing for a time the boundary among three states—Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia—before the flow carried on as the main stem of the Potomac.

Because three roads splayed from here toward Luray and Front Royal, up to the hill of St. Peter’s Church, and on to Brunswick and Frederick, travelers were constant, and the Harpers Ferry market thrived even on days that weren’t market days. There are many ways into the Appalachians, but the fair set along the C&O Canal towpath had a fame that carried unusually far. There are state lines enough in this country, yet when people said “the market on the line,” they meant this place. On market days tenant farmers from the hills came down with ramps, morels, fiddleheads, and blackberries; peddlers from the Maryland side crossed with thread and needles, round hand mirrors, pocketknives, twine, and small tin trinkets; and from downstream the fishmongers of the Potomac and the Shenandoah trudged up with shad and herring, smallmouth bass, catfish, and American eel. For a gorge, it was a respectable market indeed—but Harpers Ferry’s name was not built on trade alone.

Even when no market was set, the place tugged at people from the nearby towns, perhaps because every inn that had crawled from the towpath up onto the knolls poured hard cider unusually clear and cold and pan-fried trout the moment it came up from the water. Perhaps it was the old-time ballads, heavy with sorrow and style, and the shape-note hymns with their meaty harmonies that drifted year-round through the weeping willows lined along the porch. And then there were the tent shows and string bands that now and then rolled in from the west; by custom and precedent they always shook out their last rehearsal—really a first performance—right here before crossing a state line. That too raised the market’s name and made it dear.

Of them all, May’s inn, the Willow & Trout, was the most renowned: drink that tasted better than elsewhere, prices that ran low, and May’s generous hand. Folks favored and pitied her all the more because she had lately lost her mother and lived with only her bachelor son and two kitchen girls, waiting for a husband whose road back was doubtful. If a traveler’s purse ran short or his kit proved wanting, he’d make for May’s as a matter of course.

“When I come back from Maryland, we’ll settle up together.”  
People said it as if it were nothing.

It was a summer sundown—willow switches rinsed by the river, shad flashing in the evening glow—when an old brush-and-comb hawker, well past sixty, climbed May’s porch with frames and comb boards across his shoulders, a cane in one hand and a fan in the other. Right behind him stood a slender young woman of about twenty-one with a small bundle tucked at her side. Both looked bone-tired.

“Two of you, counting the young lady?” May asked, watching the ‘big girl’ more than the old man. He nodded without a word.

That night, after the table was cleared, he asked leave to introduce himself. Walker, he said. He lived near Shepherdstown and had come to earn a bit on the Virginia side. His home country was the mountains of West Virginia; as a young man he’d followed a friend and lived for a time near Harpers Ferry, then drifted to the shipyard at Charleston, then the mills at Swannanoa, and later to a factory town inland—lonely as an island—where he spent eighteen years, turning gray before finally circling back to the Shenandoah a few years ago. When May asked how he could travel with such a grown girl, he said he’d meant never to wander again, not to the end of his days, but if they didn’t take to the road, the two of them would starve.

“She’s your daughter, then?” May looked past the slant of lamplight to the corner where the young woman, eyes bright, glanced this way now and again, her shoulders round and gentle. The old man nodded again. A life of drifting, he said, had made even the place he’d returned to feel like another lodging—no better than a stranger’s house—and a father’s daughter with nowhere to lean was a sorrow.

“When I was young I liked sport myself,” the old man went on. “I roamed with a little troupe, playing the clown and making merry… New Year’s when I was twenty-four—thirty-six years ago to the day—I spent one night of high fun at this very market.” He peered around the room as if teasing out a thread of memory.

“Mercy, that’s an age ago!” May feigned more surprise than not.

It rained the next day.

Eli, who set up his book stall only on market days, was coming down a day early from the school attached to St. Peter’s on the hill to lay in what he’d need for tomorrow. The road from the church to the market is a scant couple of miles of good going, but that day the sweep of water and rock and splendid gorge would not let him have the back of the road.

At first he’d been led to school by the wrist, dragged really, by his grandmother, and then he’d kept going, tugged along by affection for the older boys. But of late the daily bell, the Latin hymns, even the clear shade of the elms and the maples in the yard had grown wearisome.

He’d always wanted to wing off to somewhere—anywhere—but his mother flared up red-eyed at the very word “go.”

“I’ve no husband, no kin to speak of. I’ve staked my life on you. If you talk of going day and night, who am I to lean on?” He’d heard that lament until it set like nails in his ears.

His grandmother, for her part, had hoped the bell would bleed the wander out of him once she’d sent him to school at ten. But when Eli was about three, a traveling phrenologist—one of those men who read an outlook by the bumps of a skull—had passed through the inn and declared, “This boy has the temperament of a traveler,” and for a time she took it to heart and mourned. She asked the parish priest one day, and an odd hermit beyond the ridge on another, but the saying never changed.

“He’s born to take after his daddy’s ways,” his grandmother had muttered—only half a dig at his mother, and not from malice. May, who took such remarks to heart, would answer, “Children don’t fail to resemble their parents. Root and branch start with the mother,” and scolded her own self along with her mother for good measure.

The truth was more tangled. Thirty-six years before, Eli’s grandmother had fallen for a roaming troupe’s slow, pendulum-swinging tune and conceived May; later May herself, taken with a man who drifted like a white cloud, conceived Eli. Mother and daughter had both been born to this market inn. There was no time, and no sense, for blaming anyone. If Eli’s roaming bent came from his mother’s choosing “a man of the road,” and if she chose such a man because her own mother once lost her heart to a troupe, then the root of the boy’s traveling temper lay with the grandmother. She tried to tame it by setting him to the bell; when the bell failed, May meant to try peddling books and see if trade could spend what church could not. Eli, for his part, was drawn more to tales than hymns and liked the idea of dealing better than the yard, and so May, after extracting a promise that he’d at least keep the Harpers Ferry market, gave him a stall.

When Eli came up on the porch ledge, May sat up in a start. “Hot as it is, why so late getting down?” She handed him a towel and a fan.

The stranger who had been reading penny tales aloud to May looked up from the book and met Eli’s eyes. A tapered face; eyes bright as blossoms, white and black set off clean. Eli felt a quick sting in his chest and, suddenly shy, glanced out at the willows in front of the house.

A moment later the young woman slipped inside, and May brought out Eli’s dinner. “She’s the comb man’s girl,” she said, looking pleased.

“A comb man?” Eli held the tray but didn’t lift his spoon, watching his mother’s face.

“He’s gone into the Shenandoah hollows. Says he may cross into Maryland after. Last evening he took the hills. The girl’s an only child. He begged to take her along, so I said we’d keep her awhile.” May studied his face as if to read him. “How long does he mean to stay up there?”

“If he takes to it, he’ll push deeper along Blue Ridge.”

Then, as if to herself, “She doesn’t seem like the daughter of such a man, does she?” The girl’s name was Lucy.

Eli lifted his spoon in silence, but he pushed the tray away before he’d eaten half.

Next day, as he sat at his stall, the comb man’s daughter came down with his dinner. The inn and the market were within shouting distance, and Meg usually did the carrying; he felt awkward that a young woman had been sent. But she set the basket down with a smile bright in her blossom-eyes, and her gaze ran straight to the food sheds where they sold candy apples, sorghum sticks, and cut comb.

“Where’s Meg?” Eli, feeling her happiness in his chest, kept his head turned aside and asked a little roughly.

“The porch is crowded. May sent me.” Lucy, who swallowed most of her words, answered in a Shenandoah lilt, her voice clear. Slender waist, wiry limbs, plump backs of the hands, full lips—the sound fit the build.

“Lucy, set Eli’s wash water.”  
The next morning May kept Meg in the kitchen and put all of Eli’s tending on Lucy—wash water, barley coffee, tray, towel. “She’s not dim, she’s warm, and there’s no meanness in her,” May said, with a touch of pride. “Her father—strange to say—seems half eager to leave her with me, as if she were to be my foster girl.” She paused to read Eli’s face and went on, “Still, your say matters, so I’ve only half agreed… Take her up sometime and show her the Seven Hills overlook.” It was as if she sought his consent.

Lucy said their place on the Shenandoah side was a shack at the foot of a ridge, far from town, with hardly a neighbor.  
“What did they do with the house then?”  
“Lock the door and that’s that,” May answered for her. “But I worry having Lucy out on the road.”

It began to look like Walker truly meant to leave Lucy with May. May had begged Eli to marry more than once, and though the barmaids sometimes kicked up trouble with him, he’d never set his heart on any of them. Now May seemed anxious that Lucy not give Eli cause to dislike her.

When Eli came up from the dry goods store below with a pair of new shoes, May grinned and, instead of liquor, dipped him a bowl of hard cider. “Too hot for anything else.” She was generous with tastings when she strained a barrel.

“Lucy, come on out. You’ll be thirsty—have a drink first.” May called toward the room. Lucy came out in a neat calico blouse and slender linen skirt, and with those clear eyes she looked like a lotus riding the water.

“That was mine, twenty years ago,” May said, half wistful. “I let the seams out yesterday—more room in it than you’d think… Here, drink up. No need to act shy in front of Eli.” Lucy took the cup, smiling, and seemed to finish it inside.

Eli went first to the willows and wet his new shoes; Lucy followed. Eli had said he needed to go up to the bookshop on the hill to collect, and May had answered that Lucy had been wanting for days to gather greens and should see the overlook anyway—so take her. Eli’s heart beat a little quick. He’d grumbled that he didn’t know one green from another, and May had said, “Who asked you to pick? Just walk ahead and show the way,” and he could argue no more.

From the start Eli left the main road and took the brushy path few used. This was Blue Ridge foothill country; trails were often more notion than path. He’d grown up here, but more than once the deepening thickets lost him.

Look up—ridges stabbed the sky. Look down—underfoot the hazed green of brush like a sea, white sunlight falling in streams. Summer blackberries instead of mountain grapes, wild grapevines in place of akebia, pawpaw fruit still green; cherry red raspberries and mulberries so black that the least touch stained your hands.

Eli walked ahead, beating back the kudzu with a green alder stick. Lucy lagged, breaking off tender ramps or stopping for strawberries.

“Hurry up—what are you doing?” Eli would halt and scold, and she would drop berries or ramps, press her full lips together, and hop after him. After a while she’d fall back again.

“Oh my!” she cried at last. He turned to see her skirt snagged high on a branch as she stood on an oak. Why the oak? A blackberry cane had arched up within reach; the thorns were tough and the slope too steep to climb from below, so she’d gone up the oak wrapped with grapevine. She could not free the fabric without letting go the branch that steadied her, and if she let go she’d fall. The sun poured under her; a gust might lift the petticoat—Eli tried to keep his eyes averted and reached with his stick.

He tried to pry the fabric free with the sapling cane, but it was too short and kept brushing her ankle and calf.  
“No—please! I’m going to fall!” she cried. Just then a squirrel ran the grapevine, ready to jump onto the very limb she held.  
“Just scare the squirrel off! I’m going to fall in a second!”

“You rascal…” Eli climbed to the base of the same tree, freed the snag at last, and flicked the grapevine once where the squirrel had sat. A few doves burst up and away over the briars.

“If only there were a spring,” Lucy said, wiping her brow with her skirt.

Each turn to a new spine of mountain brought a rougher knob; each lift of the canopy to the bright sky showed another valley matted with grape, blackberry, and kudzu. Deeper in, the whip-poor-wills threw a racket, and now and then a wild turkey’s call shook the fern fans.

The sun passed noon and beat down as if a coal had been set on the head. In the shade, black snails clung, leaving pale slime.

The hotter and thirstier they grew, the more they burrowed like animals into the tangles. Strawberries, blackberries, hard little wild peaches—whatever the hand reached found the mouth, and whatever reached the mouth melted like frostwater, leaving only a sour mouthful. Now and again the teeth hit green pawpaw or some other unripe thing and the bitterness spread into the cheeks. Thirstier for it, Lucy heaped a kudzu leaf with the small peachlike fruit and passed it to Eli. He set the leaf across his palms and bent to it like a drink. When it was empty, he tossed the leaf aside and leaned back on a log wrapped round with grape.

She offered a second leaf plate. He, impatient, poured it in at once and flicked the rest away, and soon began to snore.

She filled a third with blackberries and wild grapes, but seeing him asleep, ate it herself as he had. “Sleeps soundly enough,” she murmured. She tried to lie back but sneezed; her mouth was dry, her belly empty. Suddenly the whip-poor-wills frightened her.

“Maybe there’s a spring in the thicket,” she said, shouldering in until she found a pawpaw limb tangled with grape and heavy with green fruit. “If only these were ripe.” She picked three of the largest and, by habit, bit one at once. A greenish, fishy bitterness filled her mouth. “Oh, that’s green,” she said, spitting it out, and went back to Eli. The sun was already slanting; hunger came with the thirst.

“Wake up. Let’s find water.” She shook his shoulder. He opened his eyes. Flustered, she held the two green fruits to his nose. He sat up, pulled her round shoulders and the nape of her neck to him, and their lips met.

On her full lips was the sweetness of the morning—strawberries, blackberries, wild peach, the green tang of unripe pawpaw—and with it the warm scent of earth and crushed grass.

Caw-caw—an old crow swung over their heads.

“Is it far to the overlook still?” she asked at last, lifting down the lunch bundle from the grapevine.

Walker, who had gone into the Shenandoah hollows, did not return for more than a fortnight. He’d said as much when he left; he must have gone deep, May and Lucy thought.

“Looks like he’ll summer in the hills,” May would say. The two of them kept to their penny tales. Lucy’s Shenandoah lilt, a little earthy at first, grew clearer and more plaintive, like song.

In that time one new thing did come between May and Lucy: May found a tiny birthmark just above the rim of Lucy’s left ear.

One morning, as May was braiding Lucy’s hair, her hand trembled as if she were about to faint.  
“What is it, May?” Lucy asked, startled. May only stared into her eyes and said nothing.  
“May—what’s wrong?” Lucy asked again. May drew a long breath, like someone coming back to herself, and said, “It’s nothing,” and set the comb to work again. Lucy thought it strange but could not press May past a “nothing.”

Next day May, hair pinned tight, left early for errands in Charlestown. Eli was napping in the front room. A shower came. Lucy ran in with the wash, crying, “Oh no, May will be caught in the rain!” The fresh wind and damp on her hem brushed Eli’s face and woke him; his hand reached and caught her skirt. She turned her head quick, cradling the wash, and looked at him. Dimples began to rise in her cheeks, and just then someone moved outside.  
“May’s clothes will be soaked!” she called again and went back to the porch. Eli was snoring in a moment.

When he woke once more, customers were drinking hard cider on the porch. From the kitchen Lucy called, “Only catfish and green peppers for a bite tonight!” After they’d gone, Eli said, a touch peevish, “I told you not to take customers when May’s gone.”  
“If we let that barrel sit, it’ll turn by morning. May would be more cross if we wasted it, wouldn’t she?” Lucy answered as if to soothe him. A little later she came smiling. “Eli, buy me a round hand mirror—please? I’ve always wanted one.” Next day was market day; when she brought his dinner, he handed her the small mirror he’d bought ahead, and a bundle of sorghum sticks.

“Oh my!” she cried, seeing mirror and candy. She looked in it again and again with blossom-bright eyes, tucked it to her breast, and sat beside him, cracking the candy between her teeth.

He shifted this way and that whenever a shadow crossed the front of the stall to keep her from notice. Lucy loved sweets. When the candy-man or fruit-seller passed the house, she’d spring up from her sewing and stand, staring after them until they were gone.

Once Eli came down from the school and found only Lucy on the porch steps—May was nowhere about—sharing slices of watermelon with a loafer from the inn next door. When she saw Eli, her face flushed, then brightened. “Oh—Eli!”  
He didn’t look at her, went straight to his room. She set down the melon and followed with eyes wide.  
“What is it, Eli?”  
“…”  
“Hey—what’s wrong?”  
“…”  
He said nothing. When she set her arms about his shoulders to draw him close, he twisted free like lightning and, all at once, fell on her and slapped her face. She cried, “Eli, Eli!” and raised her hands at first, looking at him with a painful little frown; then, after two or three loud smacks, she turned to the corner and buried her face, taking the storm without a word.

Next day she brought his dinner to the market with her lips pressed tight and said nothing. In her clear eyes there was no deep grudge or hate over what had happened.

That night he saw her alone by the river and followed. The sky was blue with stars, and willow shade made the bank black.  
“Eli,” she said when he came close, rising and stepping up until she was near his chin, speaking low. “Why’ve you been holed up at the school all the time?” The Shenandoah lilt curled in the whisper.

About then he seldom came down unless it was for market day. After May came home wet from Charlestown, she seemed to watch them differently; his heart was delicate, and he hated being disliked, and anger at his mother made him dig in and stay uphill. That night, before he could answer Lucy, May’s voice came out of the dark—“Lucy! Lucy!” Eli wrinkled his nose and shut his mouth. “Oh, May—how can she be so hard?” he thought, throat gone tight. A firefly drifted past. Lucy sat on a rock and clenched a handful of reeds, murmuring something he could not hear for the water.

At dawn next day Eli poked around the room and kitchen, looked a little disappointed, and went back up to the school. Lucy, as ever, was at the same bend of water with the reeds, rinsing rags.

Three days later Eli came down again. Walker sat on the porch drinking cider; Lucy, hair braided and dressed in the same calico washed and ironed, a small bundle at her side, sat hunched at the edge. When she saw Eli, joy sprang into her blossom-eyes and she started up; in the same instant her full lips tightened with a warning that told what lay between them—urgent and unhappy.

“Lucy’s leaving now,” May said the moment she saw Eli.

Later he made sense of it: Walker had returned that evening—the one when Eli had gone back up the hill. He’d meant to take Lucy away at once; May pleaded for a day’s rest, and now they were packed to leave at first light. But at first hearing Eli felt as if a lump of iron had struck his skull; blood drew tight to a point, ears pricked up toward the crown, tongue curled back into his throat, a blue flash pricked at the corners of his eyes. Dizziness, anger, and hurry ran him from toes to scalp. Only now, at the point of parting, did he know how impossibly bound he was to her. Now, at the knife-edge of forever, the wick took a flame—everything unreal as a dream. He might have howled and thrown honor and shame aside if he’d let himself. But he could not show that face to May. He bit his trembling lip and dropped hard onto the porch edge.

“Fine-looking boy you’ve raised,” Walker said—surely of Eli. Eli did not turn his head, sitting as a man sits who bears a grudge against the world.

In the meantime May told how Walker, while in the hills, had come upon a young man—son of an old friend from back home—who ran a factory there. In the way of meetings, the young man had urged Walker to return to their coastal town and live there, with help to set him up. The thought of home came sudden, and with aid promised, Walker had decided to go back to the shore. To Eli, with his ears humming from fear and fury, the tale buzzed like a swarm of bees and hardly made sense.

“This cider fills me right up,” Walker said, finishing his last bowl and taking up fan and cane.  
“If you go to the coast, I suppose we’ll not see you again,” May said, standing.  
“Who knows a man’s road? If there’s a turn for it, we’ll meet again,” Walker answered, lacing his big boots.

“Go well, girl,” May said, tucking a little flowered purse with money into Lucy’s small bundle as a token. Lucy stared at May with reddened, pleading eyes. “Come again,” May said, stroking the gentle, wave-like slope of Lucy’s shoulders. Lucy buried her face in May’s breast and wept. “Hush now. Your father’s waiting.” Even May’s voice had gone thin.

“Well then, keep well,” Walker said to May.  
“If things don’t take, come back and live with us,” May urged again.  
“Keep well, Eli,” Lucy said, hunting Eli’s last look with eyes bloodshot and bright.

At that Eli sprang up from the porch as if waking, stumbled a few steps toward her, and then, as if some sense seized him, stiffened like a post and stood staring at her face a long time.

“Keep well, Eli.” Even the second farewell held the same hope in her red eyes, as if some miracle, some order would come from him. But Eli, leaning on the willow, had only fire in his gaze, and no word, no wonder came.

“Keep well, Eli.” Leaving the last words in a voice almost broken by tears, Lucy turned. Eli stood staring at the calico blouse receding in the fair light, under drooping willow branches and the mountain-ringing cry of whip-poor-will, and did not move.

He rose again only the following spring, well after Groundhog Day and the first frog songs—around Cherryblossom time, with a fine drizzle on and off. The willows out front were thread-green again; cherries and lilacs bloomed bright on the lanes and foothills.

May came in with a bowl of soup and, seeing he’d finished it, asked,  
“Do you still want to try for the western sea?”  
“…” Eli turned his head quietly.  
“Will you marry here and live with me?”  
“…” He turned away again.

Before spring fully came that year, when most had given up hope of Eli’s coming back to himself, May at last said, “If you’re set on dying, at least go knowing what sits in your mother’s heart,” and told him: that the comb man Walker was, very likely, the same roaming fellow who’d passed one night at the market thirty-six years ago and left a tie to her mother—Eli’s grandmother—and that Lucy, judging by the small mark above her left ear, might be May’s half sister. She showed him the same dark speck above her own left ear.

“When I first heard ‘thirty-six years,’ my heart went cold. I hoped I was wrong. I went so far as to fetch a traveling phrenologist out of Charlestown the next day—God help me—and he too spoke as if he knew the insides of folks and made a fool of me.” She stopped. Eli’s eyes flashed like a lamp as he looked at his mother. “Better not to know, except that once you know, you have to set your conduct right,” she said. “Don’t think hard of your mother.” She washed his thin hand with tears. Oddly, that last, almost a housekeeping of their souls, gave him strength. He stared at the ceiling with burning eyes for a long time and bit his lip as if fixing a new resolve.

He would not go west to hunt a father. He would not marry and set up a household here. May let go her stubborn hopes.  
“Then what will you do? Do as you see fit.”  
“…” He lay back without a word.

A little over a month later, on a market morning early in summer—greens coming in from the Shenandoah in place of the ones from the other hollows—Eli downed a bowl of hard cider with a plate of tender shoots and said, “Mother, have a candy tray made for me.”

May stared at him as if struck.

Another fortnight passed. The whip-poor-wills were loud as hills themselves, and the willows shone with wet light. A light dawn-shower had passed; the day cleared bright. Up at the three-way above the Harpers Ferry market, Eli was taking leave of May. He’d changed into a clean white shirt and pants, tied a silk kerchief tight on his head, and slung the new white wooden tray across his shoulder like a bar. The upper tier was more than half filled with neat sorghum sticks; the lower held a few dime novels and small notions.

Before his feet, water and road split three ways. He had turned his back on the Shenandoah way from the start; the road southeast ran to Virginia, the road northwest to Maryland. The Maryland ridge Walker and Lucy had crossed last year, eyes full of tears, still bent up from the market into the glare—but Eli, after standing awhile, turned. His steps went slow toward Virginia, Maryland at his back.

A step, and another—the farther he walked, the lighter he felt. When May’s inn—watching him from between the willows, no doubt—fell out of sight at last, he was humming a snatch of “Wayfaring Stranger” under his breath. On his left the Potomac, on his right the state line, flowed side by side.",2,1755314363.0,WritingWithAI,0,1.0,False

## key Features analysis

The effectiveness of diamond dissolving whitening strips hinges on several critical features, including the active whitening agent, the dissolving mechanism, and the overall design. Understanding these features is essential for evaluating the quality and potential efficacy of the product.

**active Whitening Ingredient:** Each strip utilizes a different concentration of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, the industry standard for whitening.The concentration of the active whitening ingredient directly impacts the speed and intensity of the whitening process. Higher concentrations generally deliver faster results but may also increase the risk of tooth sensitivity. Some strips also incorporate additional ingredients like potassium nitrate to help minimize sensitivity. The type of peroxide used (hydrogen or carbamide) can also affect the release rate of the active whitening agent, influencing both the whitening power and the duration of the process.

**Dissolving Mechanism:** The dissolving rate and completeness of the strips are crucial for user convenience and preventing residue build-up.

Advanced diamond dissolving whitening strips employ refined polymer matrices that fully dissolve within a specified timeframe, typically ranging from 15 to 30 minutes. The dissolving mechanism ensures that the active whitening ingredient is released gradually and evenly across the teeth, maximizing its effectiveness. A complete dissolution also eliminates the need to remove the strips manually, preventing any unpleasant residue or aftertaste.**Adhesion and conformity:** The ability of the strips to adhere securely to the teeth and conform to their unique contours is essential for optimal whitening coverage.

High-quality strips are designed with a flexible and adhesive material that allows them to maintain close contact with the teeth surface throughout the application process. This ensures that the active whitening ingredient is delivered directly to the enamel, promoting even and consistent whitening. The ability to conform to the teeth's contours also minimizes the risk of saliva interference, which can dilute the whitening agent and reduce its effectiveness.

**Flavor and Freshness:** A pleasant flavor can significantly enhance the user experience and encourage consistent use.

Many diamond dissolving whitening strips are infused with mild flavors like mint or spearmint to provide a refreshing sensation during the application process. This helps mask the perhaps harsh taste of the peroxide and contributes to a more enjoyable whitening experience. The freshness of the flavor is also an indicator of the product's overall quality and storage conditions.

**Strip Material and Thickness:** The texture and thickness of the strip can affect comfort, adherence, and overall effectiveness.

The dissolving matrix is typically a thin, flexible film that allows it to adhere seamlessly to the teeth. Thicker strips may be more difficult to conform to the teeth's contours, while excessively thin strips may lack sufficient structural integrity. The ideal strip material is both strong enough to withstand handling and thin enough to provide a cozy and unobtrusive whitening experience.

## Core benefits

The advantages of diamond dissolving whitening strips extend beyond just teeth whitening, offering convenience, comfort, and a user-pleasant approach to oral care.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Diamond dissolving strips eliminate the need for messy trays or manual removal. They offer a convenient and hassle-free solution for achieving whiter teeth in the comfort of your own home.

the fact that these strips fully dissolve within minutes means users can easily incorporate them into their daily routine without interrupting their activities. This makes them significantly more convenient than traditional whitening methods that require dedicated application times and cumbersome trays. You can even use the strips while commuting or attending to other tasks, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Reduced Sensitivity:** Formulations often include ingredients like potassium nitrate to minimize potential tooth sensitivity.

Many diamond dissolving whitening strips are formulated with desensitizing agents like potassium nitrate, which help reduce the risk of tooth sensitivity that can be associated with traditional whitening treatments. This makes them a suitable option for individuals with sensitive teeth who may have previously avoided whitening products. The gradual release of the active whitening ingredient also contributes to a gentler whitening process, further minimizing the risk of discomfort.

**Even Whitening:** The dissolving film conforms closely to the teeth’s surface, ensuring consistent coverage.The thin and flexible nature of diamond dissolving strips allows them to conform closely to the teeth's surface, ensuring an even and consistent distribution of the active whitening ingredient. This helps prevent spotty or uneven whitening, resulting in a more natural and aesthetically pleasing result. The full dissolution of the film also ensures that all areas of the teeth are exposed to the whitening agent, further promoting uniformity.

**No Mess or Residue:** Complete dissolution eliminates the need for rinsing or removal, providing a cleaner experience.

Unlike traditional whitening strips that require manual removal and can leave behind sticky residue, diamond dissolving whitening strips completely dissolve, leaving no trace behind. This eliminates the need for rinsing or brushing after the application, providing a cleaner and more convenient whitening experience. The absence of residue also prevents any unpleasant taste or sensation in the mouth after use.

## FAQs section

Addressing common questions can definitely help consumers feel more confident in their purchasing decisions.

**How long do the whitening effects last?**

The duration of the whitening effects varies depending on individual habits and oral hygiene. Generally, results can last for several months with proper maintenance. Avoiding staining agents like coffee, tea, and tobacco can significantly extend the lifespan of the whitening.Regular touch-up treatments may also be necessary to maintain the desired level of whiteness.

**Are diamond dissolving whitening strips safe for my enamel?**

When used as directed, diamond dissolving whitening strips are considered safe for enamel. Though, excessive or prolonged use of any whitening product can potentially weaken the enamel over time. it's significant to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and avoid using the strips more frequently than recommended. Individuals with pre-existing enamel erosion or other dental conditions should consult with their dentist before using whitening strips.

**Can I use these strips if I have fillings or crowns?**
While the whitening process primarily affects natural tooth enamel, it's generally safe to use diamond dissolving whitening strips if you have fillings or crowns. though, it's critically important to be aware that the whitening agent will not change the color of these restorations.

Expert Guide for 2025 Bahrain Company Formation with Insider Insights\
\
Alt text: Business people in a professional corporate meeting, reflecting Bahrain company formation activities..\
Forming companies in Bahrain, especially for foreign shareholders, has changed dramatically since then. Recent updates, like the 2025 regulatory reforms implemented via Sijilat’s new digital portal and the LMRA’s biometric verification requirement (effective March 2025), have transformed the landscape. As of this year, foreign direct investment in Bahrain jumped by 11% year-on-year (Reuters, Jan 2025), with over 2,400 new foreign-owned entities registered in the Diplomatic Area, Bahrain Bay, and trending zones like Amwaj Islands.\
\
Quick anecdote: In 2023 I lost a week because I used a scanned passport copy instead of a color-certified original. Don’t make the same mistake—I’ll show you how to avoid delays and save money across every step.\

Bahrain’s Strong Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain, with business districts and office towers., citing its 5.7% projected non-oil GDP growth and over $1.2 billion in FDI inflows. The Seef District and Bahrain Bay are buzzing—serviced offices are springing up everywhere, luring SMEs and multinationals alike.\
Importantly, the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) now offers direct support for foreign investors, reducing approval times for most business structures to as little as five working days. (I once registered an SPV in under 72 hours by timing my application just after Ramadan—an insider tip I’ll explain soon.)\
Key business environment highlights:\
- Over 70% market share in regional cloud computing and payment processing (Gulf News, March 2025)\
- Introduction of the 2025 “Green Company Initiative” waiving certain fees for ESG-compliant startups\
- Enhanced free zone incentives: 0% corporate tax, 100% foreign ownership, fast-track visa processing\

Required Identity Documents for Foreign Shareholders\
Overview of Documentation Needs\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: foreign shareholders preparing identity documents for Bahrain company formation. standards apply, so accuracy and document quality are non-negotiable.\
At minimum, every foreign shareholder needs:\

Passport-sized photos (white background, digital JPEG preferred for Sijilat)\
Valid visa or entry stamp (for in-person signatories)\
Corporate documents (if the shareholder is a company; see details below)\
\
If you’re a resident of a country with apostille conventions, you’ll often also need apostille certification. Gulf residents can use GCC eIDs for digital authentication, but most non-residents will need wet-ink certification.\

\
If your company formation includes GCC nationals, Bahraini eKey integration can speed things up. But non-GCC shareholders must always provide original, certified paperwork.\

A Tangent on Coffee and Contracts\
Now, sidetrack for a moment: in Bahrain, most major deals are discussed over Arabic coffee in a majlis (especially in the Diplomatic Area). No matter how digital the process gets, don’t underestimate the power of a face-to-face introduction. I once had regulatory paperwork expedited after a Ramadan iftar—relationships matter just as much as document checklists. Even the MOICT’s head of licensing prefers in-person meetings for new ventures.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New?\
The most important policy change this year is the Sijilat Digital Document Verification System launched in April 2025. All foreign identity documents must be uploaded via the verified digital portal, with live facial authentication for major shareholders holding over 10%. The LMRA’s biometric verification kiosk (now mandatory for company directors) just opened its third main branch in Seef District—pro tip: early afternoons have the shortest queues.\
Key update effective March 2025: All corporate documents (Inc., UBO) must be apostilled (or legalized at Bahrain embassy if non-apostille country) and accompanied by a local certified Arabic translation.\
I learned the hard way: skipping the apostille meant our Singaporean client lost their CR approval slot, pushing us into the post-Eid rush (not fun at all).\
\
Step-by-Step: Preparing for Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Gather and Certify All ID Documents\
\
Collect original passports for all foreign shareholders\
Obtain certified color copies (notarized in home country + apostilled if outside GCC)\
Prepare digital copies (scan at 600dpi—Sijilat portal is picky about file quality)\
Acquire recent proof of address, certified as true copy\
Get digital passport photos in required spec\
\
2. Legalize Corporate Shareholder Documents\
\
Obtain apostilled (or embassy-legalized) Board Resolution, Certificate of Inc.\
Arrange certified translation into Arabic (Bahrain law mandates local language versions as of 2025)\
\
3. Pre-fill Sijilat Application and Pre-Book MOICT Appointment\
\
Use the Sijilat pre-screen tool (my tip: Thursday mornings are fastest, just before the weekend lull)\
Book your MOICT visit early (they open at 7:30am; aim to be first in line to avoid waiting behind government clients)\
Download all required forms in advance\
\
4. Submit Documents via Sijilat Portal\
\
Digital upload of certified documents\
Live facial authentication for key shareholders (over 10% ownership)\
Schedule in-person visit only if flagged for further verification\
\
5. LMRA and Visa Processing (if applicable)\
\
LMRA’s biometric registration is now digitized (bring original passport for in-person scan)\
Visa application can be submitted in parallel; expect 3–5 days turnaround\

Why Bahrain Beats the UAE and Saudi Arabia for Foreign Shareholders\
Bahrain’s true differentiator? Streamlined digital processes, lower formation costs (often 25-40% less than Dubai), and real 100% foreign ownership for a far wider range of business activities (see foreign ownership options).\
In contrast, the UAE’s notarization requirements are stricter and Saudi Arabia’s MISA portal, while improved, still involves far lengthier UBO and security checks.\
Plus, in Bahrain, relationship building remains a time-saver: there’s nothing quite like finishing your formation paperwork while sharing dates and qahwa with your new commercial neighbors.\

FAQ: Common Questions on Foreign Shareholder ID Documents\
Q1: Do all foreign shareholders need to be physically present in Bahrain to sign?\
A: Not always. Most signatures can be handled remotely IF you prepare notarized, apostilled documents and assign a local representative via Power of Attorney. For certain sensitive sectors (financial services, telecom), at least one director may be required in-person for biometric verification.\
Q2: What’s the fastest way to certify identity documents abroad?\
A: Use international notary/translation chains—ask your formation consultant for a list with next-day turnaround. Always arrange documents before your planned Bahrain application; embassy schedules vary by country and can add weeks if not planned.\
Q3: How can I avoid delays during Ramadan or public holidays?\
A: Submit applications just after morning prayers and avoid the last five working days before Eid. MOICT and Sijilat staff often work reduced hours; pre-booking is critical. For urgent matters, a personal visit (with coffee!) can help.\
Q4: Do Bahraini free zones require different ID documents?\
A: No, but free zone applicants enjoy streamlined review and can sometimes skip in-person verification for certain low-risk sectors. Review specific benefits at Bahrain free zone guide.\
Q5: What’s the best resource for ongoing compliance support?\
A: For document updates, KYC, and annual filings, KeyLink BH’s accounting and compliance service is my top pick—especially if you’re remote or managing multiple entities.\
\
\
Forming a company in Bahrain is all about preparation, relationships, and knowing the shortcuts. With certified identity documents in hand, the right local support, and a bit of Arabic hospitality, your foreign-owned business can be up and running in record time—whether you’re launching your fintech dream in Bahrain Bay or setting up logistics in Seef District.\

# Sometimes The Body Decides For You

[Jenna Woginrich](https://substack.com/@jwoginrich)Jul 07, 2025∙ Paid

I am not the kind of person who takes naps.

I wish I was. It sounds glorious. To give yourself permission to restore the body during daylight feels like advanced meditation. Unfortunately, I’m an anxious kinetic beast. It’s not a good way to be, and yesterday my body forced me to learn that the hard way.

It was a normal morning. I got up around 5:45 and made my bed, walked downstairs, and let Friday out to pee while filling food bowls. I made coffee while the cats circled my legs. I walked around the farm and opened the coop, carried hay bales to the mare and flock, and filled and refilled troughs and watering cans to prepare the animals and crops for the heat wave ahead.

I came back inside the farmhouse and stumbled on flat ground.

I was dizzy, which I never am. A cold sheen of sweat was covering my arms, and I was feeling tired in a way I had not felt since summer camp when I was ten years old.

I went to a program called Night Owls, where girls got to learn about nature after dark. There were night swims and ghost stories, lessons on nocturnal wildlife and fireflies. We made lanterns and sang around campfire. It was perfect.

One night we hiked 3 miles round trip to a ski resort to take in the view of a locally-famous geological feature in the moonlight.

I had never hiked 3 miles before in my life, especially not after a long day of camp. I can still remember the blessed relief of laying down on my sleeping bag around midnight that night. It was the one and only time I could remember falling asleep instantly, before or since. I was standing in my kitchen *that kind* of tired. It snuck up on me.

I grabbed a mason jar off the drying rack and went to fill it with water. When I turned on the faucet the water came out steady, like normal, and then jumped. The smallest hiccup, like a kid running across the lawn stepping on the garden hose.

My knee-jerk thought: the well is shot. I can’t afford a new well. I won’t have running water in this house for years. (That was one hell of a conclusion to jump to, but that’s how catastrophic thinking works.)

It didn’t matter that a friend just helped me install the new faucet, and the whole pressure system was different. It didn’t matter that when I went to check the well outside it was buzzing trying to pull water, as the the recent dry spell had the water table lower than normal.

Nothing logical mattered. Anxiety has nothing to do with logic, it’s a primal fear that pierces and you either need to learn to live with a metaphorical spear in your chest or talk yourself down.

I’ll be 43 in three days. I’m still working on it.

My heart started pounding. I went from lightheaded to woozy. Which, of course had to be low blood sugar because besides exhaustion, I felt fine. There were no aches from the flu, no sore throat or cough. I tested myself for Covid and it came up negative (still haven’t gotten it). So it had to be some rare kind of instant-onset code-red farm diabetes and I was going down like Julia Robberts in Steel Magnolias.

Now my body was exhausted AND my brain was a tornado.

I started to realize how weak I felt. If there’s one thing I always had, it was a sturdy constitution, and I can’t remember a time in my life I couldn’t throw a 80lb feed sack on my shoulder. A well problem I made up was one thing, feeling physically weak was terrifying.

In a more rational state, I could have listed all the reasons why I was exhausted. Besides the recent pour, I hadn’t drank any water for over 12 hours and had two giant cups of coffee for breakfast (a diuretic). It was 8AM and already 81 degrees. I had been moving my dehydrated bones for hours in full sun and only ate one meal the day before (I forget to eat in summer).

I was weary in a primal way, like I had just spent my third day in a row trying to outrun a saber-toothed tiger and if I didn’t stop moving at full alert, I would die.

I know how to deal with panic. Panic and I are old friends. But exhaustion was new. I never get sick. The last time I was in bed for a day was winter 2020, a 24hr stomach bug. I was back to right in a day.

I needed to eat something, drink something, and stop moving. It felt like I was fighting off fainting. I honestly think it was my anxiety about weakness that stopped me from hitting the floor. I was too wired to drop.

I grabbed my phone and a moonpie. I always have moonpies on hand because they are both a luckpiece and a favorite snack of a close friend’s daughter. Now I just wanted the cheap energy, as everything else in the house had to be cooked from scratch. I grabbed a tall glass of ice water. I sat on a comfortable chair, slowly ate the pie, drank water, and then played a guided breathing exercise on my self-care app.

For five minutes I did nothing but breathe. Friday came over and placed her head in my lap. She reminded me I’m not alone, and besides her there was a whole farm of animals depending on me. Get it together, woman.

I’d been running on fumes for days and I didn’t even notice. Summer on the farm is the most physical activity I get all year, and it *never ends*. That’s not a complaint—I love this life and my decision to keep going—but when I get into a chore flow I get tunnel vision and all I do is go go go. It should make me more eager to rest, but the opposite is true. I pile on more tasks, a game of chicken against my own better judgement. As if someone is keeping score and if I don’t constantly up my productivity I don’t deserve to remain here.

Part of it is toxic American hustle culture and part of it is the reality of running a homestead/freelance career alone. If I am not maintaining a diligent list things fall apart. The weeds overtake the landscaping and gardens. The livestocks’ water turns tepid and murky. The flowers droop from thirst. The house starts to look like it did when I was depressed, items scattered and placed wherever convenient instead of where they belong. I spent enough of my life in clutter and confusion. Now I fight it like its my fifth job. I can’t go back to being that sad, messy, girl. I can’t tolerate being around clutter. It’s a trap.

So I don’t rest. I don’t stop. There is always something to do. Go trim the overgrown tendrils of rosebush and goldenrod on the path, check the solar lanterns still hold a charge. Weed wack the tall grass around the sheep gate, and cut back the overgrown hedge. There’s coops and barn stalls to muck, eggs to collect, gardens to weed, and a house to clean.

I am every member of this household - the farmer, the wife, the housekeeper, the gardener, the accountant and scheduler. And yesterday, it was simply too much on too little energy and the body shut down. I whirred to a stop like a wind-up toy out of tension.

I didn’t need insulin or a plumber. I needed to take a fucking nap.

My body is aging and these ongoing unprecedented times are trying on decent literate folk. You can only go so hard for so long before the body demands rest, and she only asks nicely for so long...

So I had to force myself, on a beautiful heatwave of a July Sunday, to rest. Not just stay indoors, but be still. No wiping down counters or mopping floors. No pushups and sit ups on the yoga mat. No standing if I could help it. I needed to recharge or I was going to strain a system.

Saturday I took the window AC unit out of storage and set it up in my bedroom. I had not used it yet this year, but saw how intense the next two days were going to be. I turned it on, and closed the door so the room could cool down.

I took a cool shower, taking extra care to tend to all the tired bits of my body. I made a cold drinks and packed some snacks and went in that bedroom like I had an appointment. At 3PM I put some Joe Scott videos (if I am going to lay down I might as well educate myself) and drifted off [while learning about ball lightning](https://youtu.be/_gOlQCI9Tgg?si=h6S4vtACmP49CwAY).

I woke up an hour later, hungry and a little better. My heart was no longer racing. My body didn’t feel like walking upstairs was Everest. I just needed to give myself permission to rest.

It’s so hard for me to do because I never feel like I deserve it. I am living, writing, and working full-time on my own farm. It’s a dream few ever have and I spent years of it lost in a swirl of depression and alcohol. Now that I had my life back, I never wanted to slip into those old ways. I think the constant strive for improvement was starting to not just take its toll, but to shut down the whole interstate.

The rest of the day I took it easy. I made myself stay indoors. I drafted this, worked on pet portraits, and only went out to check water and evening feeding. Friday didn’t get a two mile walk, but we did take a slow amble down the path behind the farmhouse, and we both stood ankle-deep in the creek and watched the birds for a long while.

That time outside was as restorative as the nap. I went to bed early, making myself lay down for hours before I fell asleep. I watched Gilmore Girls and drank herbal tea and was going to force a solid 8 hours in bed, sleep or not.

I managed about 6.5 of sleep and that’s 2 hours more than normal this month. When I looked in the mirror there were no bags under my eyes and I looked nothing like Julia Robberts, to my relief.

This morning I could still feel the weakness, but not the wild panic. My body was tired but not *The Vapors* from yesterday. Believe it or not, the faucet worked fine. I made sure to walk outside and dig up two potatoes and snip off some kale stems and made hash browns and eggs with chopped kale; a hearty breakfast if there ever was one. I made enough to put half in the fridge for later, so I wouldn’t skip any meals. No one has to twist my arm to eat fried potatoes at any hour of the day.

I decided to start a new tradition on the farm. A mix of tea time and Siesta, a recharge of calories and rest any time the body wants between noon and 4PM. I put an alarm on my phone and will make myself slow down and either find a hammock or bed to at least *try* to nap and then nosh on something, anything, to keep the body strong into the evening.

If you don’t give the body a day off, I guess it decides for you. That’s what I am taking as a lesson from that unpleasant day. I’m not built for rest, which is why I idealize it so much. Hammocks and river swims have their place right beside hay chucking and bucket hauling. And if I want to stick around for a few more summers, I better learn to fall asleep beside Smilodon.

Chapter 1  
  
  
Raven’s POV  
  
  
The neon sign outside Jack’s buzzed like an angry hornet, flickering between OPEN and OPE before finally settling on PEN—which, honestly, was still accurate. The place wasn’t much to look at: a squat brick building with windows so dusty they might as well have been painted shut, wedged between Duston’s only hardware store and a defunct post office that still smelled like mothballs and regret.  
  
  
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, fried onions, and the faint, lingering ghost of cigarette smoke from back when smoking indoors was still legal. The jukebox in the corner wheezed out a half-hearted country tune, something about lost love and pickup trucks, while the ceiling fan overhead spun lazily, like it couldn’t decide whether it wanted to circulate air or just give up and fall on someone’s head.  
  
  
Duston, Kansas. Population: who cares. The kind of town where the cows outnumbered the people, and the people outnumbered the brain cells after last call. I’d rolled in seven weeks ago with a duffel bag, a fake ID, and a story about being a drifter looking for honest work.  
  
  
Honest work.  
  
  
Good one, Raven.  
  
  
Here’s the thing about Duston—it was the perfect place to disappear. A nowhere town where people minded their business just enough to not ask why a 24-year-old girl with no last name (or at least, not one she’d admit to) showed up out of nowhere and started slinging drinks at a dive bar.  
  
  
I wiped down the bar with a rag that had seen better days—possibly during the Reagan administration—and tried not to think about how many germs were probably staging a mutiny on its surface.  
  
  
The door creaked open, and in walked Sheriff Grady, his boots scuffing against the worn wooden floor like he owned the place. Which, in a way, he kinda did. Duston was small enough that the law and the local drunkards were practically on a first-name basis.  
  
  
""Afternoon, Sheriff,"" I said, sliding a coaster his way. ""The usual?""  
  
  
Grady grunted, which in Duston-speak translated to ""Yes, please, and also I’m too tired for small talk."" I poured him a double of the cheap stuff—because if there was one thing I’d learned in eight years of running, it was how to read a man’s mood by the way he sighed.  
  
  
The scars on my face itched when the whiskey fumes got thick in the air. Not a real itch—more like a memory. A reminder. The kind that didn’t fade, no matter how many years passed or how many states I put between me and the bastard who put them there. I can still hear his voice, even now.  
  
  
""My daughter doesn’t cower,"" he’d snarled, backhanding me hard enough to split my lip. ""You’ll learn to fight, or you’ll learn to bleed.""  
  
  
I’d done both.  
  
  
Most folks in Duston were polite enough not to stare. Or, if they did, they at least had the decency to wait until my back was turned.  
  
  
But then there were the ones who didn’t.  
  
  
Like the two assholes currently camped out at table four, nursing their third round of Bud Lights and thinking—wrongly—that I couldn’t hear them over the jukebox.  
  
  
""Shame about the face,"" one muttered, his voice slurred with cheap beer and cheaper charm. ""Bet she’s got a hell of a body under that apron.""  
  
  
His buddy snorted. ""Just turn her around, problem solved.""  
  
  
The glass I was polishing cracked in my hand.  
  
  
Not enough to shatter—just a sharp, sudden snap of stress fractures spiderwebbing through the cheap tumbler. I set it down carefully, took a slow breath through my nose, and counted to five in my head.  
  
  
One. The scent of their sweat, sour with alcohol.  
  
  
Two. The thud of their heartbeats, lazy and unafraid.  
  
  
Three. The creak of the barstool as Joe, the owner of Jack’s, shifted, his knee cap protesting as he turned to give them a look.  
  
  
Four. The low, warning growl building in my chest—one I forced back down before it could escape.  
  
  
Five.  
  
  
I exhaled.  
  
  
Then I grabbed a fresh bottle of Jack and sauntered over to their table.  
  
  
""Gentlemen,"" I said, sweet as poisoned honey, setting the bottle down between them with a thunk. ""Looks like you’re running low. On manners.""  
  
  
The first guy—beefy, red-faced, with the kind of grin that made me want to rearrange his teeth—leered up at me. ""Aw, c’mon, darlin’. We’re just havin’ fun.""  
  
  
""Yeah,"" I said, leaning in just enough to let the dim light catch the scars. ""Funny thing about fun—it stops being fun when the other person ain’t laughing.""  
  
  
His buddy opened his mouth—probably to say something real fucking stupid—but Joe cut in before he could.  
  
  
""Boys,"" he drawled, tipping his glass their way. ""I’d quit if I were you. Raven here’s got a temper, and you’re lookin’ awful flammable.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Raven’s POV  
  
  
The clock hit 2 AM, and the last of the drunks stumbled out into the Duston night, leaving behind the usual aftermath—sticky floors, half-empty glasses with cigarette butts floating in them, and the lingering scent of bad decisions. I was wiping down the counter when Joe lumbered out from the back, his massive frame casting a shadow that could eclipse a small moon.  
  
  
""Another shift survived, kid,"" he rumbled, voice like gravel rolling downhill. He tossed me my pay envelope—thicker than usual, like always when I pulled a double. ""You look like hell warmed over.""  
  
  
""Gee, thanks, Joe,"" I deadpanned, wiping down the last of the glasses. ""You always know just what to say to make a girl feel special.""  
  
  
Joe chuckled, the sound rumbling deep in his chest like distant thunder. ""Yeah, yeah. You gonna go punish yourself at the gym again, or you finally gonna get some damn sleep like a normal person?""  
  
  
I shrugged, sliding the glass onto the rack. ""Gotta stay sharp. Never know when some drunk idiot’s gonna test his luck.""  
  
  
Joe’s grin was all teeth. ""Ain’t that the truth. Though, between you and me, I’d pay good money to see you put Grady’s nephew through a wall one of these days.""  
  
  
I snorted. ""Tempting. But I like my job. And my freedom.""  
  
  
Joe waved a meaty hand. ""Eh, I’d bail you out. Long as you didn’t break anything too expensive.""  
  
  
That was Joe—all bark, no bite unless you really earned it. He’s a sweet big guy, really. The kind of guy who’d toss a troublemaker out on his ass one minute and slip him a coffee and a twenty for a cab the next. The locals loved him, respected him, and—most importantly—knew better than to push him.  
  
  
I grabbed my jacket from the hook behind the bar, the worn leather creaking as I shrugged it on.  
  
  
""Don’t work too hard, boss,"" I tossed over my shoulder as I headed for the door.  
  
  
Joe’s laughter followed me out. ""Says the kid who’s about to go lift a small car for fun. Youth is wasted on the young, I swear to God.""  
  
  
The night air hit me like a slap, crisp and sharp with the scent of dust and distant rain. My boots crunched over gravel as I made my way to the parking lot, eyes scanning the shadows out of habit.  
  
  
There she was—my beat-up blue pickup, rust creeping along the wheel wells like ivy, but the engine still purred like a contented cat when I needed her to. I patted the hood like an old friend. Still here. Good.  
  
  
I didn’t need a getaway car in Duston. Not really. But old habits died hard, and I’d learned the hard way that running was sometimes the only option you got.  
  
  
Keys in hand, I hesitated.  
  
  
The gym was my cover story, and a decent one—plenty of folks lifted after work to blow off steam. But the real workout waited at Off the Rail, a dimly lit, no-frills fight club tucked behind the old rail yard.  
  
  
From the outside, it looked like a run-down storage unit—which, technically, it was. But inside? Inside, it was something else.  
  
  
The club’s air was thick with sweat, leather, and the sharp tang of liniment. The ring was nothing fancy—ropes, mats, and enough bloodstains in the wood to give it character. A few regulars nodded my way as I ducked through the crowd. No supernatural scents here, no magic. Just humans who liked to hit things and didn’t ask questions.

When I was on the hunt for investment banking analyst roles, I sent A LOT of networking emails letting people know I applied, or asking for coffee chats, etc.

And at the end I would always drop my phone number and LinkedIn profile. But that started to feel generic, and I wanted to be more creative, to stand out more.

So I made myself a simple personal website. Nothing fancy, but it definitely had more personality than my LinkedIn profile. Plus, I put a clean button that directed viewers on my site directly to my LI.

Interestingly, I immediately started realizing people were *friendlier* in their email responses. I don't know that it increased my response rate, but it definitely felt like my reception was increased.

I also continued to improve the site to show more of my personality, which I believe enhanced the reception of my emails (or at least lead people to be kinder).

Eventually, I broke into IB as an analyst and haven't upgraded the site much, but I'm thinking it's due for a refresh as I eventually look for my next role.

""Had to sweet-talk my boss into letting me leave."" I rolled my shoulders, already feeling the familiar itch under my skin—the need to move, to fight.  
  
  
Dante chuckled. ""Joe? Dude’s a teddy bear.""  
  
  
""Yeah, a teddy bear with a felony record,"" I shot back.  
  
  
He laughed, and for a second, it was easy to forget what I was. Just another fighter. Just another body in the ring.  
  
  
""Yo, Raven,"" called Marty from behind the makeshift front desk,""You here to work out or just scare the newbies again?""  
  
  
I smirked. ""Depends. Any fresh meat dumb enough to take me up on it tonight?""  
  
  
Marty snorted. ""Nah, they wised up after last time. But Rodriguez is around. Said something about you owing him a rematch.""  
  
  
Rodriguez. Now that was a fight worth sticking around for.  
  
  
I jerked my chin in acknowledgment and headed toward the lockers.  
  
  
I shoved my olive-green duffel inside, the kind of thing you’d see in gyms. But this wasn’t just gym gear. It’s my getaway bag.  
  
  
I unzipped it just enough to check the contents, my fingers brushing against:  
  
  
A fake ID under the name ""Raven Reyes"" (birthdate, hair color, and home state all wrong, but hey, I love that first name, sue me).  
  
  
$3,200 in mixed bills, rubber-banded and tucked inside a rolled-up pair of socks.  
  
  
A burner phone, charged but inactive.  
  
  
A change of clothes—black jeans, a gray hoodie, sturdy boots.  
  
  
A switchblade I’d lifted off a drunk in Wyoming.  
  
  
All of it ready to go in under five seconds.  
  
  
I exhaled, tension bleeding out of my shoulders. Still there. Still safe.  
  
  
""You gonna stare at your bag all night, or you gonna fight?""  
  
  
I didn’t jump, but it was close. Rodriguez leaned against the lockers, arms crossed, his knuckles a mess of scar tissue and fresh tape.  
  
  
""Just admiring my impeccable packing skills,"" I said, slamming the locker shut. ""You here to lose again, or what?""  
  
  
He grinned, all teeth. ""Nah, chica. Tonight’s the night you eat the mat.""  
  
  
I rolled my shoulders, cracking my neck. ""Promises, promises.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Raven’s POV  
  
  
Rodriguez took one look at me still shrugging off my jacket and jerked his chin toward the open mat space. ""You just got here. Warm up first. I’ll clear the ring.""  
  
  
I smirked. ""Scared I’ll cold-cock you if you don’t give me time to loosen up?""  
  
  
""Nah,"" he said, already turning away. ""Just don’t wanna hear you bitch about pulled muscles later.""  
  
  
Fair enough.  
  
  
I locked the locker, then headed to the open floor. The air was thick with the smell of sweat, leather wraps, and the faint metallic tang of blood from earlier bouts. The concrete walls echoed with grunts, the smack of fists on heavy bags, and the occasional burst of laughter from the regulars.  
  
  
I started slow, jogging laps around the perimeter of the room, letting my body wake up. My boots scuffed against the mat, my breath evening out as my muscles warmed. By the third lap, my pulse had settled into a steady rhythm, my senses sharpening.  
  
  
Then I moved to stretching.  
  
  
I planted my feet wide, bending at the waist to press my palms flat against the floor, letting my hamstrings burn. My tank rode up, exposing the defined lines of my lower back, the scars there pale and jagged against my skin.  
  
  
Minuets later, I finished my last stretch, rolling my shoulders as the familiar burn of warmed-up muscles settled in. Across the room, Rodriguez was clearing the center mat, shooing away a couple of rookies who looked like they’d rather watch the fight than be in one.  
  
  
Marty, leaning against the chain-link fence surrounding the ring, let out a low whistle as I twisted into a deep lunge.  
  
  
""Aw man,"" he sighed dramatically, pressing a hand to his chest. ""I think I fall in love with you, AGAIN, sister. I’m gonna propose to you right here, right now. Please say yes.""  
  
  
I snorted, rolling my eyes as I switched legs. ""Sure, Marty. The day you can take me in a fight is the day I say yes.""  
  
  
Dante, who had been wrapping his hands nearby without looking up, deadpanned, ""Guess that ain’t gonna happen in this lifetime, dude.""  
  
  
Marty clutched his chest like he’d been shot. ""Damn, Raven. Cold.""  
  
  
Rodriguez clapped his hands, cutting through the bullshit. ""Alright, lovebirds, break it up. You ready, Raven?""  
  
  
I cracked my knuckles. ""Always.""  
  
  
Rodriguez cracked his knuckles, rolling his shoulders like a bull ready to charge. The dim overhead lights of Off the Rail threw sharp shadows across the mat, turning the scuffed vinyl into a battlefield of light and dark.  
  
  
""No holding back tonight, "" he said, grinning. His stance was loose, but his eyes were sharp—he’d learned the hard way that underestimating me was a mistake.  
  
  
I smirked, bouncing lightly on the balls of my feet. ""Wouldn’t dream of it.""  
  
  
Then we were moving.  
  
  
Rodriguez came in fast, leading with a probing jab—testing my guard. I slipped it, countering with a low kick to his lead leg. Thud. Solid contact, but he barely flinched, already pivoting into a heavy right hook. I ducked, feeling the wind of his fist ruffle my hair, and fired back with a sharp elbow toward his ribs. He twisted, taking the hit on his arm instead, and shoved me back with a shoulder check.  
  
  
We circled, breathing steady, eyes locked.  
  
  
He feinted left, then lunged right, shooting for a takedown. I sprawled, hips low, digging my forearm into his neck to stall his momentum. For a second, we were locked in a sweaty, grunting stalemate—then I hooked a leg behind his knee and twisted, sending us both crashing to the mat.  
  
  
The crowd around the pit whooped. Someone yelled, ""Fuck him up, Raven!""  
  
  
Rodriguez rolled with the fall, popping back up before I could capitalize. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grinning. ""Nice try.""  
  
  
I flipped him off.  
  
  
We went at it again, trading blows—knees, elbows, fists. I caught him with a spinning back kick to the liver; he repaid me with a clubbing overhand that made my ears ring. The rhythm was familiar, almost comforting. This wasn’t a death match, just a dance we’d done a dozen times before, each of us pushing the other to the edge without going over.  
  
  
Then—smell.  
  
  
A scent I hadn’t smelled in weeks hit me like a bucket of ice water.  
  
  
WOLF.  
  
  
I was distracted for a second.  
  
  
Fun facts: when you’re in a middle of a fight, a second might as well be an hour.  
  
  
Rodriguez’s fist connected with my jaw.  
  
  
I hadn’t even seen it coming.  
  
  
The world tilted. My knees hit the mat, the impact jolting up my spine. The crowd’s cheers turned into a muffled roar, like I was underwater.  
  
  
Idiot. Never look away.

Normally, I'm not an ""oh my god this is really bad"" when something happens for a day, but this seemed a little different. She had normal poops yesterday, sometimes near the evening she has softer stool. When cleaning up her diarrhea inside, I noticed that there are black spots throughout the liquid. She isn't acting any different but obviously when you first look up speckled poop the first thing that comes up is melena. However, there are no pictures of what is considered ""coffee grounds"" appearance in the poop so I have noting to compare it to. When I smelled it, it just smelled like usual diarrhea.

She does eat dirt sometimes...but I haven't seen her eat it in the last 24-36 hours (so I think).

Poop #1 earlier in the day, poop #2 30 minutes ago.

This involves aging the wine in stacked barrels, with periodic blending of older and younger wines.The solera system allows for a fraction of the oldest wine to be bottled each year, while the barrels are topped up with younger wine, perpetuating a continuous aging process. This ensures that the sherry maintains its characteristic flavor profile across different vintages.

I ran these by ChatGPT and supposedly they’re about 22 lbs, so a 40 L pack with 25 lbs max load should be good. Maybe I’ll add a z fold mat as well. Could anyone with experiences chime in on which pack is the better option? Honestly I don’t know for sure what features I need as I’ve only done day hikes before. 

On a side note am I packing too much stuff? Am I missing anything important? Maybe a first aid kit and something to store food from the bears? Maybe bear spray as well?

1mrig3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mrig3z/i_left_my_husband_without_hesitation/,I Left My Husband without Hesitation,"Chapter 1  
  
When I was nine months pregnant, I received an email with an electronic bank statement. My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transferring $30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.  
  
Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.  
  
It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-  
  
“The happy woman who gets $30,000 in pocket money every month.’ I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‘accept.’  
  
Immediately, a message popped up:  
  
‘Did you get the bank statement?‘  
  
Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man’s shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.  
  
The caption read:  
  
“Thank you for the birthday gift, love!”  
  
Although only the man’s back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.  
  
Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‘on–a–business–trip‘ husband was celebrating another woman’s birthday.  
  
The irony was almost suffocating.  
  
  
  
My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.  
  
A jasmine–scented perfume.  
  
Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.  
  
I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.  
  
I never wear perfume.  
  
When I didn’t respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.  
  
I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel’s betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.  
  
He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.  
  
Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‘My Carina.‘  
  
She softly asked, “Do you love me?”  
  
This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn’t seen in years.  
  
‘I’ll always love you, Cara.’  
  
I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.  
  
Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, “Olivia, why didn’t you turn on the lights? It’s so dark! What if you fall?”  
  
He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear–streaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.  
  
“Why are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?” he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.  
  
As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, “Where were you?”  
  
“I was working late at the office. What’s wrong, honey?” Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..  
  
‘You’re lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live–streamed the whole thing!‘  
  
Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. “Honey, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,” I said, resting my hands on my belly.  
  
As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. “Can you get some for me?”  
  
Annoyance flickered across Daniel’s face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. “Those dumplings aren’t anything special. Besides, you’re pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.” Standing up, he added, “For the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?”  
  
Without waiting for a response, he muttered, “I’m going to take a shower. I’m exhausted. Why don’t you call Mom and ask her to make you something?”  
  
The bathroom door clicked shut.  
  
Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, “Oh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.”  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Daniel’s phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.  
  
Did he really think I was that naïve?  
  
The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara’s ultrasound report.  
  
Success!  
  
Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app’s storage. Sure enough, Cara’s profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.  
  
He said, “If love lasts forever,” and she replied, “Does it matter if we’re together every day?”  
  
I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of “Darling, I miss you” and “Baby, when will I see you again?” Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.  
  
Next, I opened Daniel’s shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.  
  
With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I’d found it.  
  
Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn’t stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.  
  
When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.  
  
Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn’t make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.  
  
The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.  
  
A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.  
  
His voice was soft as he whispered, “Baby, there’s an urgent project at work. I need to go in.”  
  
I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, “I don’t feel well. Could you stay?”  
  
For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.  
  
But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.  
  
As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. “Sweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean’t miss it.” “I’ll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?”  
  
A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, “Drive safely.”  
  
I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. “Maplewood Estates,” I told the driver.  
  
He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel’s car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel’s arms like a butterfly.  
  
He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.  
  
Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.  
  
My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.  
  
“Driver, follow that car,” I said.  
  
The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.  
  
As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, “Olivia, endure it. The pain will pass.”  
  
When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.  
  
As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, “Miss, take care of yourself. For the baby’s sake, don’t hurt yourself.”  
  
Since discovering Daniel’s affair, I hadn’t told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.  
  
I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. “Don’t worry, Sir. No–one can hurt me anymore. Because I’m ready to throw the trash where it belongs.”  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check–up with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.  
  
At that moment, I realized it wasn’t that he was too busy. He didn’t want to make an effort for the wife he’d been married to for seven years.  
  
In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, “The doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let’s follow the advice this time, okay?”  
  
“Aww, fine, I got it!” she replied, pouting playfully. But it’s your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.”  
  
“Alright, alright, I’ll take the blame,” he said with a smile. “It’s my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?”  
  
“That’s better.” She smirked. “Fine, I’ll forgive you… this time.”  
  
As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital’s harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.  
  
The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.  
  
To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was  
  
thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.  
  
She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, “Olivia, you’ve lost.”  
  
I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. “It’s okay, Olivia.”  
  
Then, I whispered to myself, “He’s just a man, nothing more.”  
  
As the car turned the corner, I waved. “Daniel, I don’t want you anymore. You’re hers.”  
  
In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well–known divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.  
  
By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.  
  
It was Mom.  
  
“Olivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren’t you home?” Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.  
  
Before I could respond, she continued, “Oh, that Danny. You’re this far along, and he’s still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.”  
  
Hearing my mom’s voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.  
  
“Mom, don’t worry,” I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn’t see me.  
  
“We’re just out having dinner.” I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. “Oh, we’re being careful. Danny’s right here with me.”  
  
I had to keep it together. I couldn’t let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn’t.  
  
“It’s raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.”  
  
I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.  
  
There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.  
  
Chapter 4  
  
Daniel didn’t come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:  
  
‘Hey Olivia, I’m working late tonight and crashing into the office. It’s getting cold and rainy, so don’t forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‘  
  
I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn’t even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People’s hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.  
  
A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom’s place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.  
  
It was Cara.  
  
We met at a café downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.  
  
“I thought you wouldn’t come,” she said, a smug lilt in her voice. “After all, you never replied to my messages.”  
  
I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. “Why wouldn’t I come? I haven’t done anything shameful that I need to hide.” I leaned back, still smiling. “Besides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.” “You-!” she snapped, but I cut her off again.  
  
“Oh, and thank you, by the way,” I said, my voice steady. “For sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would’ve been much harder on my own.”  
  
I smiled, this time more dismissively. “So, this coffee’s on me.”  
  
I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.  
  
“What do you mean by that?” she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.  
  
“It means I don’t want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. “If you want him, he’s all yours.”  
  
Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. “What game are you playing now? Don’t think I’m buying this for a second!”  
  
The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.  
  
Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, “Save my baby!”  
  
I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the café staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.  
  
As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.  
  
Finally, he picked up on the last call.  
  
“Olivia, there’s an emergency at work,” Daniel’s sharp and impatient voice said. We’re in the middle of a critical meeting. I’ll call you later, okay? Be good.”  
  
The line went dead. But I could hear Cara’s voice clearly in the background.  
  
I turned away from the nurse’s pitiful eyes and wiped the blood from my hands with my dress. My fingers shook as I took the phone and dialed my mom.  
  
I had to sound calm.  
  
“Mom, I… I’m going into labor.” I swallowed hard, fighting through the pain..  
  
My mom replied, “Don’t panic, okay? Just listen. Go to my place, grab my ID and the hospital bag, and take a cab to Riverside General. Whatever the doctors tell you to do, do it.”  
  
“I’m fine, Mom, really. Don’t worry about me.” I reassured her before quickly hanging up.  
  
Right then, the contractions hit me like a tidal wave, and I screamed.  
  
Cold sweat poured down my face, my whole body shaking uncontrollably. As I drifted in and out of consciousness, I used the last bit of strength I had to grab the doctor’s hand.  
  
“Please, save my baby!” I gasped.  
  
I couldn’t lose my baby. Not again.

Me, god forbid I don’t feel like they’re all doing me a favor.

Example: I needed a laptop I can use for an hour in the conference room cuz I forgot mine at home. I had to be on the phone 3-4x with the staff for them to tell me they didn’t want to take a laptop away from an intern (not interns in law school, so not really doing anything pressing), and I was asked if I can just run home and get mine.

Meanwhile, my colleague, practiced same number of years as me - was on a Zoom meditation, which he had a lot of down time. But the staff delivered him coffee. Then delivered him a damn sandwich.

Every single time, Sebastian would wait silently during the cooling-off period, confident she would come crawling back. She would plead, and only then would he agree to withdraw the papers.  
  
But on the hundredth filing, as Nora stood to leave, the clerk behind the desk couldn’t resist asking, ""So, when are you coming back to cancel it this time?""  
  
Nora glanced at Sebastian’s retreating figure—cold, indifferent—and steeled herself.  
  
Not this time.  
  
When the thirty-day waiting period ended, it would finally be over.  
  
The wind outside the courthouse was sharp, biting into her skin. Nora stepped onto the sidewalk just in time to see Sebastian slide into his sleek black Bentley without so much as a backward glance.  
  
She walked slowly, the hollow ache in her chest widening with every step. The cold seeped in, filling the cracks of her shattered resolve.  
  
Then—screeching tires.  
  
Before she could react, a hard shove sent her sprawling onto the pavement. Her knees burned, her palms stinging as they scraped against the concrete.  
  
Through the tangle of her hair, she recognized Sebastian’s friends stumbling out of the car.  
  
""Shit! We just hit Mrs. Blackwood!""  
  
""Don’t call her that,"" someone muttered. ""They’re divorcing. Sebastian hasn’t called it off yet.""  
  
Nora pushed herself up, legs trembling. Her gaze flickered to the Bentley’s half-lowered window, where Sebastian’s sharp profile was barely visible in the shadows.  
  
One of the guys hesitated. ""Should we take her to the hospital or just head to the club?""  
  
A beat of silence. Nora’s breath hitched as she waited, her heart pounding.  
  
""To the club."" Sebastian’s voice was ice.  
  
Those three words cut deeper than any blade.  
  
The car roared away, exhaust fumes choking her.  
  
Clenching her jaw, Nora forced herself to stand. She limped home, every step a fresh agony—but nothing compared to the raw, gaping wound in her chest.  
  
The moment she stepped inside, she began packing.  
  
She tore through their shared space, yanking out every remnant of their years together.  
  
The diamond bracelet he’d tossed at her after a fight. The silver cufflinks she’d stolen from his dresser. The jar of a thousand handwritten notes she’d left for him over the years.  
  
One by one, she dumped them into the trash. Then, from the depths of her drawer, she pulled out a faded envelope.  
  
Her hands shook as she unfolded the letters inside—letters she’d found by accident, hidden in Sebastian’s safe.  
  
""You brought coffee to my office again today. You didn’t see me watching from the window as you left.""  
  
""That blue dress you wore last night—I wish I’d been the only one to see you in it.""  
  
""Three years of you chasing me. I almost gave in last week. But I wanted to see how far you’d go.""  
  
Each line was a knife to her ribs.  
  
If she hadn’t stumbled upon these letters, she would never have believed that Sebastian—always so cold, so detached—had ever cared for her at all.  
  
She’d first seen him at a university gala.  
  
Sebastian had been onstage, delivering a speech with effortless arrogance, untouchable and perfect.  
  
One look, and she was lost.  
  
She’d spent four years chasing him—bringing him coffee he never drank, memorizing his schedule just to ""accidentally"" run into him, even breaking her ankle once when she’d snuck into a closed gym to watch him play basketball.  
  
And when they finally got together, he’d remained distant. She’d been the one to propose. She hadn’t minded.  
  
But after three years of marriage, Sebastian had filed for divorce ninety-nine times.  
  
The first time? Because she’d overcooked his steak.  
  
The second? Because she’d laughed too loudly at a party.  
  
The ninety-eighth? Because she’d texted him eleven times in a day instead of his arbitrary limit of ten.  
  
Every. Single. Time. She had begged.  
  
On the ninety-ninth filing, she’d spent the entire night on her knees in his study before he’d finally relented.  
  
That same night, she’d found the letters.  
  
All this time, he’d enjoyed watching her beg.  
  
The next morning, Sebastian filed for divorce for the hundredth time—because she’d left a water ring on his desk.  
  
And for the first time in seven years, Nora looked at the man she’d loved and felt nothing but exhaustion.  
  
This time, she wouldn’t play his game.  
  
She wiped her face roughly and turned back to her suitcase—only to freeze.  
  
Her mother’s silver locket—the only thing she had left of her—was gone.  
  
She tore apart the bedroom, the closet, even the bathroom. Nothing.  
  
Then she remembered. The only other person who’d been in the study that night was Sebastian.  
  
Clenching her fists, she grabbed her coat and headed out.  
  
The club was pulsing with noise, laughter spilling into the hallway. She didn’t bother knocking.  
  
Inside, Sebastian’s friends were placing bets.  
  
""Five days max before Nora comes crawling back!""  
  
""Three. She’s obsessed.""  
  
""One. She was literally on her knees last time!""  
  
Sebastian sat at the center, swirling his drink, expression unreadable.  
  
Just as someone asked, ""Sebastian, what’s your guess?""—  
  
The door slammed open.  
  
Nora stood there, eyes blazing.  
  
""Forever.""Chapter 2  
  
Just as Nora began to speak, a honeyed voice interrupted her.  
  
“Sorry I’m late.”  
  
Victoria Kensington glided into the room, effortlessly stealing the spotlight.  
  
With practiced grace, she looped her arm through Sebastian’s and nestled against him, her smile saccharine.  
  
Nora’s fingers curled into her palms as she took in their closeness, forcing herself to look away.  
  
Victoria had been a constant shadow in Sebastian’s life—through his first girlfriend, his engagement, even his marriage to Nora.  
  
He never pushed her away. Never set boundaries. Instead, he let her linger, blurring lines as if it meant nothing.  
  
For years, Nora had questioned if Sebastian truly loved Victoria.  
  
But after finding those letters, the truth was undeniable.  
  
Victoria was just a pawn. A way to provoke Nora’s jealousy.  
  
Sebastian enjoyed watching her unravel.  
  
His gaze flickered to Nora standing in the doorway, and his brow furrowed. “What are you doing here?”  
  
Her grip tightened on her bag strap. He hadn’t even heard her.  
  
“My necklace is missing,” she said, holding his stare. “I just want to know if you’ve seen it.”  
  
Sebastian stilled, then his expression darkened. “That’s why you came?”  
  
“What other reason would there be?” Nora countered. “What did you think I was here for?”  
  
A storm brewed in his eyes.  
  
She knew that look.  
  
It always appeared when she refused to play into the narrative he’d scripted in his head.  
  
“Oh, that silver one?” Victoria cut in, blinking innocently. “I mentioned I liked it, so Sebastian gave it to me.” She sighed. “But I lost it on my way home.”  
  
Nora’s vision blurred with rage. “You gave her my necklace?!”  
  
“It’s just a piece of jewelry,” Sebastian snapped. “I’ll buy you a dozen more if it matters that much.”  
  
“It was my mother’s!” Her voice cracked.  
  
Silence swallowed the room.  
  
For a fleeting second, Sebastian looked stunned—then his mask of indifference slid back into place. “It’s gone. Stop making a scene.”  
  
Nora bit down on her lip until copper flooded her tongue.  
  
She’d told him what it meant to her. And still, he dismissed her.  
  
Was this what love looked like to him?  
  
Realizing the necklace was truly lost, she spun on her heel and strode out. If she stayed, she’d shatter right there in front of them.  
  
Behind her, a chair screeched against the floor. Sebastian stood. “We’re leaving.”  
  
He followed her.  
  
Outside, the wind lashed at Nora’s cheeks like shards of glass.  
  
She kept her head down, walking fast, unwilling to let anyone see the tears she couldn’t hold back.  
  
Then—a sharp crack above.  
  
Before she could react, a shout rang out. “Look out!”  
  
Her head jerked up. A massive billboard hurtled toward them.  
  
Sebastian lunged—  
  
Their eyes locked—  
  
And at the last second, he veered away, throwing himself over Victoria instead.  
  
Crash.  
  
Agony tore through her. But worse than the pain was the humiliation.  
  
He’d rather let her bleed than risk anyone thinking he cared.  
  
When she woke, sterile white walls greeted her.  
  
Nora turned her head weakly. The room was empty.  
  
“You’re awake,” a nurse said, entering to adjust her IV. “You’ve been unconscious for two days. Luckily, it’s just a mild concussion.”  
  
Her throat burned. “Who brought me in?”  
  
“Your husband,” the nurse replied. “He was frantic. Covered in your blood, looked like he was about to lose his mind.” She paused. “But the second the doctor said you’d recover, he left. Said it was urgent. Strange, isn’t it?”  
  
Nora closed her eyes and laughed, the sound hollow.  
  
Of course he ran.  
  
Sebastian would never let her see the truth.Chapter 3  
  
Sebastian didn’t appear for days.  
  
It was only when Nora was being discharged from the hospital that he finally showed up again.  
  
Victoria clung to his arm, her lips curved in a smug smile.  
  
""Honestly, Nora, you recover so quickly. I’ve always been delicate—just a little cold, and Sebastian panicked,"" Victoria cooed, batting her lashes. ""He insisted on bringing me here for a full examination.""  
  
Nora continued packing her belongings, refusing to spare them a glance.  
  
Sebastian’s gaze lingered on her, sharp and probing, as if trying to decipher her thoughts.  
  
Then, abruptly, he spoke. ""Perfect timing. We’ll drive you home. Victoria’s penthouse is under renovation, so she’ll be staying with us for a while.""  
  
Nora snapped her suitcase shut. ""Fine.""  
  
It didn’t matter. In two weeks, the mandatory waiting period would be over, and their marriage would dissolve.  
  
Sebastian could move in whoever he pleased. It wasn’t her concern anymore.  
  
Her indifference visibly darkened his mood.  
  
Back at the mansion, he made a show of doting on Victoria right in front of her—whispering in her ear, brushing strands of hair from her face.  
  
But no matter how hard he tried to provoke her, Nora remained unfazed.  
  
At dinner, Sebastian peeled shrimp and fed them to Victoria with deliberate tenderness.  
  
Nora forced herself to eat, though every bite tasted like sawdust.  
  
""Ah!"" Victoria suddenly gasped, clawing at her neck. ""It burns!""  
  
Nora looked up to see angry red welts spreading across Victoria’s skin. Her breathing turned ragged.  
  
Sebastian swept her into his arms. ""Call the doctor!""  
  
The physician arrived swiftly, diagnosing a severe peanut allergy.  
  
Sebastian’s glare turned icy as he summoned the maid. ""How many times have I told you Victoria can’t have peanuts? Who put peanut oil in the food?""  
  
The maid wrung her hands, her eyes darting nervously to Nora. ""Mrs. Blackwood instructed me to, sir. I—I didn’t dare refuse.""  
  
Nora shot to her feet, her chair screeching. ""I never—""  
  
""Please, Mrs. Blackwood, don’t lie!"" the maid cried, cutting her off. ""You said you couldn’t stand Miss Kensington being here. You told me to teach her a lesson!""  
  
""Nora.""  
  
Sebastian’s voice was a blade, slicing through the tension. The room turned frigid.  
  
He strode toward her, his polished shoes striking the marble like gunshots. ""You’ve been so quiet since the divorce papers. I thought you’d finally accepted it."" His gaze bore into her, ruthless. ""Clearly, I was wrong.""  
  
Nora opened her mouth to protest—then froze.  
  
A flicker of satisfaction curled at the edge of Sebastian’s lips. Brief, but unmistakable.  
  
""If you wanted Victoria to suffer an allergic reaction…"" He turned, retrieving a crystal decanter of whiskey from the bar. The bottle landed on the table with a sharp crack. ""Then you should experience it too.""  
  
Nora’s blood turned to ice as her back hit the wall.  
  
He knew. He knew she was deathly allergic to alcohol.  
  
Two bodyguards seized her, their grip bruising.  
  
The whiskey burned like acid, searing her throat, her stomach. She choked, tears streaming, yet somehow swallowed half the bottle.  
  
The itching started instantly—deep, maddening, crawling beneath her skin.  
  
Red splotches erupted across her neck, her arms. Her breath came in shallow gasps. Darkness crept at the edges of her vision.  
  
The last thing she saw before unconsciousness took her?  
  
Sebastian, silhouetted in the golden light, smiling.  
  
He was smiling.  
  
When she awoke, the bedroom was bathed in the dim glow of a single lamp.  
  
Sebastian sat on the edge of the bed, flipping through documents. He didn’t look up until she stirred.  
  
""Ah, you’re awake."" He closed the file, voice casual. ""Don’t test me again.""  
  
Nora pushed herself up, her throat raw.  
  
She caught the fleeting relief in his eyes—and suddenly, she understood. Her chest constricted.  
  
He didn’t care about Victoria’s allergy.  
  
What infuriated him was her indifference. What pleased him was seeing her jealous.  
  
Just like those locked-away letters. He thrived on her desperation.  
  
But she was done playing.  
  
Two more weeks.  
  
Then, they would be free of each other forever.Chapter 4  
  
Sebastian went all out, hosting an extravagant gala in celebration.  
  
Under the glittering chandeliers, he remained by her side all evening—intercepting unwanted drinks, adjusting the strap of her gown, playing the perfect doting partner.  
  
The murmurs spread like wildfire through the crowd. Sebastian treats his childhood friend like royalty, but his wife? An afterthought. They whispered that if not for Nora’s stubborn persistence, their marriage would have crumbled years ago.  
  
Nora stood apart, swirling her champagne, the gossip rolling off her like water.  
  
Midway through the night, she slipped outside to the garden terrace, craving the crisp night air.  
  
The breeze carried away the cloying scent of alcohol.  
  
“Finally reached your breaking point?”  
  
Victoria’s voice slithered from behind, laced with venomous amusement.  
  
She sauntered closer, heels clicking, lips curled in a smirk. “Honestly, if I were you, I’d have walked away ages ago.”  
  
Nora didn’t bother turning. “Get lost.”  
  
Victoria’s laugh was sharp. “Don’t pretend you’re unaffected. Four years chasing him, three years married, and he still looks right through you. Pathetic. Want to test it? Even if I pushed you into that lake, he wouldn’t lift a finger.”  
  
Before Nora could react—  
  
A brutal shove sent her stumbling backward.  
  
Splash.  
  
Icy water swallowed her whole. She gasped, choking as it flooded her mouth, her lungs.  
  
Through the blur, she saw a figure sprinting toward the water—  
  
“Nora!”  
  
Sebastian’s voice was raw, frantic. He plunged in, arms locking around her waist, hauling her against him.  
  
For a heartbeat, she stared into his eyes—wide, terrified, alive in a way she’d never seen.  
  
On the shore, Victoria stood frozen, disbelief twisting her features.  
  
Sebastian—who barely spared Nora a glance on a good day—had just dived in without hesitation.  
  
The way he clutched her, like she was something irreplaceable—  
  
It made no sense.  
  
Victoria’s nails dug into her palms. This wasn’t supposed to happen.  
  
On the grass, Sebastian dropped to his knees, pressing trembling hands to Nora’s chest. He didn’t stop until she coughed up water, gasping.  
  
Then—like a switch flipped—his expression shuttered.  
  
He stood abruptly, voice cold. “What were you thinking, falling in at a party?”  
  
Nora sat there, soaked, fingers twisting in her ruined dress. “I didn’t fall.” Her voice was steel. “Victoria pushed me.”  
  
Victoria’s eyes welled instantly. “That’s a lie! How could you accuse me?”  
  
Nora’s laugh was brittle. With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone. “Then let’s settle this with the police. Attempted murder carries consequences.”  
  
Sebastian caught her wrist, grip bruising. “Enough. It was an accident. Drop it.”  
  
Nora’s head snapped up. “She tried to drown me.”  
  
“And yet here you are,” he said flatly. “Stop making a scene.”  
  
The absurdity nearly choked her.  
  
She knew he used Victoria to provoke her—but this? Dismissing her life?  
  
Her thumb hovered over the call button. “I’m not backing down.”  
  
Sebastian snatched the phone. “You’re hysterical. Cool off.” He signaled a guard. “Take her to the quiet room. She stays until she’s calm.”  
  
Nora fought like a wild thing as the guard dragged her away.  
  
“Sebastian! Are you insane?!” Her voice cracked. “She tried to kill me! You know she did!”  
  
Her nails raked bloody lines down the guard’s arm. One heel snapped off in the struggle.  
  
But it was useless.  
  
The door slammed shut, plunging her into darkness.  
  
No windows. No light. Just suffocating black.  
  
Her breath hitched.  
  
“Let me out—”  
  
The walls pressed in. Memories surged—ten years old, locked in a basement by her stepmother for three endless days.  
  
That same terror coiled around her throat now.  
  
She curled into the corner, nails biting into her palms.  
  
Somewhere in the dark, a rat scuttled. She clamped her lips shut, afraid to even breathe.  
  
Time dissolved.  
  
She refused the meals they slid under the door. Overturned the water glass.  
  
Her throat burned, but the real torture was the silence, the isolation—the way it gnawed at her sanity.  
  
When the door finally creaked open the next morning, the light stabbed her eyes.  
  
“Had enough?” Sebastian’s voice, cool and detached.  
  
She lifted her head slowly.  
  
There he stood—immaculate suit, not a hair out of place—while she looked half-mad, hair tangled, dress ruined.  
  
Suddenly, she laughed. Tears spilled over.  
  
“You’re right.” Her voice was a ghost. “I’ve had enough.”  
  
No more fighting. No more clinging.  
  
All she wanted now was to escape—Sebastian, Victoria, this gilded cage that had become her prison.  
  
His frown flickered, something uneasy in his gaze. But it vanished just as fast.  
  
“Good.” He turned away. “See that you remember that.”  
  
He didn’t see the resolve hardening in her eyes.  
  
He didn’t see the end.Chapter 5  
  
Nora staggered back into her apartment and collapsed onto the bed, burying her face in the pillows.  
  
She thought she had cried herself dry, but fresh tears still spilled over, dampening the silk beneath her.  
  
Curling into a tight ball, she clutched the sheets, each breath aching like a knife between her ribs.  
  
She stayed like that—numb, hollow—until morning light crept through the curtains. Eventually, she dragged herself up, forcing down tasteless toast and gulping water like it could wash away the pain.  
  
Then her phone buzzed.  
  
A message lit up her old university group chat:  
  
""Reunion tonight! 7 PM at The Grand Royale! Don’t miss it!""  
  
Nora stared at the screen, her throat tightening.  
  
Since she’d be leaving for Paris soon, this would be her last chance to see them. A final goodbye.  
  
The Grand Royale glittered under crystal chandeliers. Nora had dabbed concealer over her puffy eyes and slipped into a simple ivory dress, understated but elegant.  
  
""Nora!"" Charlotte, her former roommate, waved excitedly from a round table. ""Over here!""  
  
A circle of familiar faces greeted her, asking about her life, her work.  
  
Charlotte smirked, leaning in. ""Remember how you chased Sebastian all through uni? Did you ever catch him?""  
  
A few others perked up, clearly eager for gossip.  
  
Nora’s fingers stilled around her wineglass.  
  
Back then, everyone knew she’d been obsessed with Sebastian. But they’d only gotten together after graduation—so no one knew they’d ever been married.  
  
And Sebastian had refused to even discuss a wedding.  
  
""No,"" she said, forcing a light laugh. ""Never did.""  
  
If she could rewrite history, she’d erase him entirely.  
  
""Seriously?"" someone gasped. ""Even you couldn’t land him? The man’s standards must be insane!""  
  
""Don’t worry,"" Charlotte chirped, already tapping her phone. ""I know at least five guys who’d kill to take you out—""  
  
""Who’s playing matchmaker?""  
  
A deep, icy voice cut through the chatter.  
  
Nora froze.  
  
She turned slowly to see Sebastian and Victoria standing just steps away.  
  
Sebastian looked devastating in a tailored black suit, a silver tie pin glinting under the lights. Victoria clung to his arm, radiant in a crimson gown that drew every eye in the room.  
  
The group erupted.  
  
""Sebastian?! No way!""  
  
""Is this your girlfriend?"" someone blurted.  
  
Victoria ducked her head with a coy smile. Sebastian didn’t deny it.  
  
Murmurs swirled instantly.  
  
""Of course the king of the finance program ends up with a supermodel. Power couple goals.""  
  
Nora sipped her water, gaze fixed on the table like it was the most fascinating thing in the world.  
  
Sebastian’s stare burned into her, sharp enough to draw blood.  
  
The party resumed, laughter and nostalgia filling the air. Then someone produced a bottle for Truth or Dare.  
  
After a few spins, the bottle landed on Victoria.  
  
""Dare!"" she declared, fluttering her lashes at Sebastian.  
  
""Kiss someone here for fifteen seconds!""  
  
The group whooped.  
  
Victoria bit her lip, pretending to hesitate—but she was already stepping toward Sebastian.  
  
He lounged on the sofa, one arm slung over the back, his gaze sliding past the crowd to Nora.  
  
She didn’t even look up from her phone.  
  
His jaw tightened.  
  
""Sebastian…"" Victoria stood before him, breathless.  
  
Then he yanked her down into a fierce, possessive kiss.  
  
The room erupted in cheers.  
  
The kiss lasted far longer than fifteen seconds—deliberately loud, deliberately obscene.  
  
Nora finally glanced over.  
  
And met Sebastian’s darkened eyes over Victoria’s shoulder.  
  
She held his gaze for one heartbeat.  
  
Then returned to her phone, expression blank.  
  
Sebastian’s grip on Victoria turned bruising.Chapter 6  
  
Sebastian fed her, his arm wrapped possessively around her waist as he murmured sweet nothings into her ear.  
  
Yet, his gaze kept straying back to Nora.  
  
She didn’t react. Not even a flicker of emotion.  
  
When the party ended, Nora slipped away to the restroom to touch up her makeup.  
  
The moment she stepped out, Victoria materialized at the end of the hallway, blocking her path.  
  
""See this?"" Victoria smirked, shoving her phone in Nora’s face. The screen displayed a photo of her and Sebastian locked in a passionate kiss. ""He wants me. So do us both a favor and sign those divorce papers already. Stop humiliating yourself by clinging to him.""  
  
Nora didn’t dignify her with a response. She simply walked past, brushing her shoulder against Victoria’s without a word.  
  
Victoria’s face twisted in fury. Her carefully orchestrated moment had just been dismissed like it was nothing.  
  
Her fingers curled into a fist, ready to strike—until the sound of approaching footsteps made her pause.  
  
A second later, two sharp slaps rang out.  
  
Victoria had struck herself—hard. Her cheeks bloomed red, swelling instantly.  
  
The restroom door burst open.  
  
""Sebastian!"" she wailed, throwing herself into his arms, tears streaming. ""Nora hit me! Just because I was teasing you earlier…""  
  
Sebastian held her, but his eyes burned into Nora’s.  
  
So this was why she’d seemed so indifferent all night.  
  
She was jealous.  
  
The realization sent a dark thrill through him, though his expression remained icy.  
  
""It was harmless fun,"" he said coldly. ""And we’re divorced. What I do is no longer your concern."" His gaze raked over Nora’s pale face. ""Hurting Victoria won’t change anything. If you want me back, you’ll have to do better than this.""  
  
""I didn’t touch her,"" Nora said evenly. ""She—""  
  
""Enough."" His voice cracked like a whip. ""If you’re going to act like this, then stay here and think about what you’ve done.""  
  
The door slammed shut. The lock clicked.  
  
Nora pounded against it until her hands ached, her skin raw.  
  
Hours later, the lock finally turned.  
  
She exhaled, stepping out—only for three men to emerge from the shadows, surrounding her.  
  
The leader grabbed her hair, jerking her head back. ""You Nora Sinclair?""  
  
""No,"" she lied, already twisting to run.  
  
A fist buried itself in her stomach.  
  
The pain stole her breath. Before she could recover, another man yanked her up by her hair.  
  
A brutal slap snapped her head to the side. Blood welled at the corner of her lips.  
  
""Pretty face, but no shame, huh?"" The man sneered, slapping her cheek mockingly. ""Let’s fix that.""  
  
The blows rained down.  
  
Nora crumpled, curling into herself, arms shielding her head.  
  
Something cracked in her ribs. White-hot agony seared through her, but she bit back every sound.  
  
""Alright, that’s enough,"" one finally muttered. ""Ms. Kensington just wanted her taught a lesson.""  
  
Their footsteps faded, leaving her broken on the cold tiles.  
  
Every breath was fire.  
  
She tried to move her fingers. Even that sent pain lancing through her.  
  
Then, Victoria’s laughter echoed down the hall. ""Let’s see if she keeps that pride now.""  
  
Nora rolled onto her back, staring up at the blinding lights.  
  
Blood trickled down her temple.  
  
And yet—she smiled.  
  
So this was what Sebastian wanted?  
  
Maybe he’d once cared for her. But in the end, he wanted her broken. Destroyed. Trapped in a life worse than death.  
  
Fine.  
  
He got his wish.  
  
But it would be the last time.Chapter 7  
  
""Sebastian, there's a storm coming tonight. Will you stay with me until I fall asleep?""  
  
Nora clung to the banister as she ascended the stairs, every movement sending sharp jolts of pain through her body. Beads of cold sweat dotted her forehead with each labored step.  
  
Sebastian opened his mouth to refuse—until he saw her trembling frame. His jaw tightened. ""Fine.""  
  
Without another word, he wrapped an arm around Victoria’s waist and guided her toward the master bedroom, as if Nora were nothing more than a ghost in their home.  
  
A bitter smile touched Nora’s lips as she limped silently into the guest room.  
  
The following days blurred together as she poured herself into a prestigious design competition.  
  
This was the life she had once abandoned—the life she was determined to reclaim after the divorce.  
  
Back in university, Nora had been the star of her class. Her mentor, Isabella Whitmore, had once declared she would revolutionize the design world.  
  
But that dream had shattered the day Sebastian saw a colleague drop her off at home.  
  
""Quit your job, or I walk,"" he had said, his voice ice-cold.  
  
She had obeyed without protest. Now, for the first time in years, her fingers danced across the sketchpad again.  
  
Just as she was refining the final details of her submission, the door swung open.  
  
Sebastian strode in with Victoria at his side. The moment his eyes landed on the sketches, his expression darkened.  
  
""I told you I don’t approve of this,"" he snapped, snatching the pencil from her hand. ""If you think this will change my mind about the divorce, you’re wasting your time.""  
  
Nora almost laughed.  
  
Did he really believe she still cared about his approval?  
  
Wordlessly, she gathered her designs.  
  
Sebastian mistook her silence for surrender and left, satisfaction etched across his face.  
  
Victoria lingered, her gaze lingering on the sketches with undisguised fascination.  
  
Three days after submitting her entry, Nora received a call from the competition organizers.  
  
""Ms. Sinclair, we’ve received a plagiarism claim against your work. Unless you can provide proof of originality, we’ll have to disqualify you.""  
  
""What?"" Nora’s breath caught. ""Who am I accused of copying?""  
  
""The submission matches one from Victoria Kensington. Given her rising reputation, the burden of proof falls on you.""  
  
Nora’s stomach dropped. She remembered the way Victoria had studied her sketches.  
  
""I have the original draft,"" she insisted.  
  
But when she searched her room, the manuscript was gone.  
  
""Looking for this?""  
  
Nora whirled around. Victoria stood in the doorway, holding the missing designs.  
  
""How did you get those?"" Nora demanded.  
  
Victoria smirked, twirling the papers between her fingers. ""Sebastian gave them to me. He said I could have whatever I wanted.""  
  
She stepped closer, her voice a venomous whisper. ""He’s mine. Stop clinging to a dead marriage. Let him go—it’s pathetic.""  
  
Nora’s vision blurred. She stormed to Sebastian’s study, but he barely glanced up.  
  
""I warned you to stop this nonsense. If you’d listened, you wouldn’t be in this mess.""  
  
She stared at the man she had loved for seven years, her heart fracturing.  
  
Why did he always do this?  
  
He never respected her passions. Never considered her feelings.  
  
If not for those old letters, she might have believed he never cared at all.  
  
With the original draft gone, Nora knew arguing was pointless. The world already saw her as a fraud.  
  
Numb, she retreated to her room and drowned in the darkness.  
  
The shrill ring of her phone jolted her back to reality.  
  
""Nora! Is it true? Are you returning to design?"" Isabella’s voice crackled with excitement. ""I saw your competition entry!""  
  
Nora’s throat tightened. ""Isabella, I didn’t plagiarize.""  
  
""I know,"" Isabella said without hesitation. ""No one else has your touch. I’ve always known that.""  
  
A sigh. ""What a waste, giving it all up for Sebastian.""  
  
""I was a fool,"" Nora admitted, wiping her tears. ""But the divorce is almost final. I’m ready to start over.""  
  
""Perfect!"" Isabella cheered. ""Join my studio in Paris. Your old classmates are here, and we’re thriving. With your talent, you’ll be the industry’s brightest star!""  
  
""Are you sure?""  
  
""Of course! Who trained you, hm?"" Isabella teased. ""If you hadn’t vanished all those years ago—""  
  
Nora inhaled deeply. ""I’ll come. As soon as the divorce is done.""  
  
The door slammed open.  
  
Sebastian stood there, his expression unreadable.  
  
""Where,"" he growled, ""do you think you’re going?""Chapter 8  
  
Sebastian narrowed his eyes at her, suspicion flickering in his gaze, but he didn’t press further.  
  
Instead, he said, “You and Victoria have been at each other’s throats because of the design competition. I’ll take you both to the theme park tomorrow. It’ll help clear the air.”  
  
Nora almost refused immediately but caught herself.  
  
She remembered how she used to plead with him to visit amusement parks, only for him to dismiss them as juvenile.  
  
If she rejected him now, it might raise questions.  
  
“Fine,” she murmured.  
  
The theme park was swarming with visitors.  
  
Sebastian stuck close to Victoria, fastening her seatbelt on the roller coaster, lifting her onto the carousel, even feeding her cotton candy.  
  
Nora lingered behind like an afterthought.  
  
Then, Sebastian’s phone buzzed—a call from the office. He stepped away to answer it. Victoria seized Nora’s wrist. “Let’s try the bungee jump!”  
  
Nora instinctively recoiled. “No.”  
  
“Sebastian said we should try to get along,” Victoria whispered, stepping closer. “Still bitter about the design theft? You really can’t let things go.”  
  
Spectators nearby began to glance their way.  
  
Nora pressed her lips together, unwilling to cause a scene. Reluctantly, she followed Victoria onto the platform.  
  
Click!  
  
The harness locked into place. Victoria leaned in, her voice dripping with malice. “Oh, by the way, Sebastian promised me a private getaway to Bora Bora once the divorce is finalized—”  
  
The ride lurched violently before she could finish.  
  
“Ah!”  
  
The safety strap snapped.  
  
Nora’s stomach dropped as she and Victoria plunged from the towering height.  
  
Wind screamed past her ears. She squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact.  
  
But instead of pain, she landed in strong, familiar arms.  
  
When she opened her eyes, Sebastian’s face was inches from hers, his expression frantic.  
  
He held her so tightly she could feel his racing heartbeat.  
  
“You—”  
  
Before she could speak, he jerked back as if burned.  
  
“Mistake,” he muttered, voice rough, before rushing to Victoria’s crumpled form. “Victoria!”  
  
At the hospital, a doctor rushed forward. “She’s hemorrhaging badly—needs an immediate transfusion! RH-negative blood. Our reserves are critically low!”  
  
Sebastian’s gaze snapped to Nora.  
  
“You’re RH-negative.” It wasn’t a question.  
  
Nora leaned against the wall, her knee still oozing blood. She met his eyes and understood instantly.  
  
“Donate,” he commanded, stepping close enough for his breath to ghost over her ear. “Do this, and I’ll revoke the divorce papers.”  
  
His scent—cold, familiar—once would have made her pulse skip.  
  
Now, it left her hollow.  
  
When the nurse handed her the consent form, Nora signed without hesitation.  
  
She couldn’t afford to let Sebastian suspect anything—not when Paris was so close.  
  
She had to keep playing the role.  
  
The needle slid into her vein. She turned her head, watching her blood fill the bag.  
  
One bag. Then another.  
  
“That’s enough!” the nurse suddenly cried. “She’s past the safe limit!”  
  
Nora’s vision swam. A high-pitched ringing drowned out all sound.  
  
The world blurred. She glimpsed Sebastian standing nearby, his lips moving, but she couldn’t hear a word.Chapter 9  
  
The sterile white walls of the hospital burned my vision.  
  
After Nora had completed her blood transfusion, the doctors insisted she remain under observation. Yet, not once did Sebastian come to see her.  
  
Her phone buzzed relentlessly—Victoria’s latest taunt.  
  
A photo of Sebastian spoon-feeding her soup.  
  
Another of him standing vigil by her hospital bed.  
  
And then, the most intimate betrayal—a stolen snapshot of him pressing a kiss to Victoria’s cheek while she pretended to sleep.  
  
Nora deleted them one by one, her heart now a numb, hollow thing.  
  
When love dies, even pain fades into silence.  
  
On the final day of the waiting period, Nora woke before dawn.  
  
Golden sunlight spilled through the curtains as she zipped her suitcase shut, the last of her belongings tucked inside.  
  
The plane ticket to Paris—departing at 3 PM—lay nestled in her purse.  
  
Then, the doorbell chimed.  
  
Sebastian stood on the threshold, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, as if he’d just stepped out of a boardroom.  
  
""Victoria’s condition is stable,"" he said without preamble. ""I promised to accompany you to withdraw the divorce filing. I keep my word.""  
  
Nora studied him in silence.  
  
""However,"" he added coldly, ""if you pull another stunt like this, I’ll be the one filing for divorce next time.""  
  
A bitter laugh nearly escaped her.  
  
There would be no next time.  
  
The drive to the courthouse was suffocatingly quiet. Nora clutched her bag strap until her knuckles whitened, the car finally rolling to a stop.  
  
""We’re here."" Sebastian unfastened his seatbelt. ""Make it quick. I need to get back to Victoria.""  
  
Nora’s gaze drifted to the courthouse doors, her fingers tracing the edge of her phone.  
  
She needed to ensure he didn’t follow her inside.  
  
Just as she opened her mouth, Sebastian’s phone rang.  
  
""Victoria?"" His brow furrowed as he answered. ""What’s wrong? Calm down—I’m on my way.""  
  
Hanging up, he turned to Nora. ""She’s hysterical. I have to go. Handle the withdrawal yourself and text me when it’s done.""  
  
Nora lowered her lashes, relief hidden beneath them. ""Fine.""  
  
She watched his car peel away before stepping into the courthouse.  
  
The clerk smiled in recognition. ""Ms. Sinclair, here to withdraw your application again?""  
  
""No."" Nora slid her documents across the counter. ""I’m here to finalize my divorce.""  
  
Back at the apartment, she placed Sebastian’s copy of the divorce decree on the coffee table and lifted her suitcase.  
  
The door clicked shut behind her—soft, yet final. A clean severance from seven years of devotion.  
  
On the way to the airport, the sun blazed overhead.  
  
Nora rolled down the window, closed her eyes, and breathed in the scent of freedom.  
  
Goodbye, Sebastian.  
  
This time, I’m choosing myself.Chapter 10  
  
""Ms. Kensington, was that man taking care of you these past few days your boyfriend? He seemed so devoted to you.""  
  
""No, Sebastian has always treated me this way.""

I started making it simple and just for myself first but the scope creep got to me and I ended up with a fully fledged app.



Before publishing I thought Id ask for some opinions and if people like it or would use it.

Core functionality, add an expense with one tap from home screen of app. I know people get lazy tracking expenses so I made it as easy as possible for a person to add an expense.

Other functionalities include setting up a date for your income, amount of your income and choose a currency, then at that date the income repeats (this part is also completely optional)

You can add and categorize expenses, keep track of them in groups (weeks, months, years)

Add additional income (one-time), for people who do gigs

Currency change, you can change your currency setup and it does the exchange with the latest info it can find on your main balance while keeping old transactions with the same currency you had.



Some other additional features include:

Exports of data (CSV/PDF)

Customizable widgets (for your home screen)

Automatic expenses (rent, insurace etc) that repeat

Savings tracker

Themes (Light mode, dark mode, other colors)

Month to month comparisons

Biometric / passcode lock



Im thinking of some of the less core features to be ""premium"", what are your thoughts on that?

The app has a very nice and clean UI design and the entirety of the data is stored locally.

Then, an email notification flashed on his laptop: ""You're invited to the Christening of Leo Thomas."" Our last name. The sender: Hayden Cleveland, a social media influencer.



An icy dread settled in. It was an invitation for his son, a son I didn't know existed. I went to the church, hidden in the shadows, and saw him holding a baby, a little boy with his dark hair and eyes. Hayden Cleveland, the mother, leaned on his shoulder, a picture of domestic bliss.



They looked like a family. A perfect, happy family. My world crumbled. I remembered him refusing to have a baby with me, citing work pressure. All his business trips, the late nights-were they spent with them?



The lie was so easy for him. How could I have been so blind?



I called the Zurich Architectural Fellowship, a prestigious program I had deferred for him. ""I'd like to accept the fellowship,"" I said, my voice eerily calm. ""I can leave immediately.""





Chapter 1

The email notification slid onto Emilio's laptop screen, a sleek, minimalist pop-up from his calendar. My husband was in the shower, the sound of water drumming against glass a familiar rhythm to our mornings. I was just placing a cup of coffee on his desk, a small ritual in our five years of what I thought was a perfect marriage.



My eyes caught the words before I could look away.



""You're invited to the Christening of Leo Thomas.""



The name froze me. Leo Thomas. Our last name.



Before I could process it, the notification vanished. A flicker, and it was gone. Retracted. As if it had never been there.



But it was too late. The image was burned into my mind. The sender: Hayden Cleveland. The name was vaguely familiar, a social media influencer whose perfectly curated life sometimes crossed my feed. A beautiful woman with a massive following.



An unease, cold and sharp, settled in my stomach. It wasn't just a random email. It was an invitation for his son. A son I didn't know existed.



The address was a church downtown, the time set for that afternoon.



A part of me wanted to slam the laptop shut and pretend I'd seen nothing. To go back to the perfect illusion I had so carefully built with Emilio, the brilliant, charismatic tech CEO who loved me.



But another part, a colder, more insistent part, knew I had to go. I had to see.



I left the coffee on his desk and walked out of our pristine, minimalist home, the home I had designed as a monument to our love.



The church was old stone, sunlight filtering through stained-glass windows. I stood in the back, hidden in the shadows, my heart a heavy, painful drum against my ribs.



And then I saw him.



Emilio. My Emilio. He was standing near the front, not in one of his sharp business suits, but in soft, casual clothes. He looked relaxed, happy. He was holding a baby, a beautiful little boy wrapped in white lace.



A little boy with Emilio's dark hair and expressive eyes.



The child, Leo, blew a bubble and giggled, reaching a tiny hand up to touch Emilio's face.



""I hope he grows up to be just like you, Daddy,"" a woman's voice said, soft and proprietary.



Hayden Cleveland stepped into view, her arm sliding around Emilio's waist. She leaned her head on his shoulder, a picture of domestic bliss. Her smile was radiant, her eyes fixed on the man I called my husband.



They looked like a family. A perfect, happy family.



My mind went completely blank. A wave of numbness washed over me, so profound it felt like I was floating outside my own body. I watched as Emilio ki\*\*ed Hayden's forehead, then turned his attention back to the baby, murmuring something that made her laugh.



It was real. All of it. The woman, the baby. His secret life.



I saw a few familiar faces in the pews, business acquaintances of Emilio's, people who had been to our home for dinner parties. They smiled at the happy couple, oblivious to the wife standing in the shadows, her world crumbling around her.



I couldn't breathe. I couldn't bring myself to walk up there, to scream, to shatter their perfect moment. The fight went out of me, replaced by a deep, hollowing despair.



I turned and walked away, slipping out of the heavy church doors and back into the noise of the city. The sounds were muffled, distant. The world felt cold, and I was colder.



I remembered a conversation from a few months ago, on our anniversary.



""Emilio,"" I had said, my voice soft. ""I think I'm ready. Let's have a baby.""



He had gone silent. He'd looked away, running a hand through his hair. A gesture I always thought was him thinking, processing.



""Not yet, Elana,"" he had said, finally. ""The company is at a critical stage. Just give me another year. I want to be able to give our child everything.""



I had believed him. I had trusted the man who pursued me relentlessly in college, the only one who could see past my ambition to the woman underneath.



He was a rival back then, both of us at the top of our architecture program. He was brilliant, driven, and cold to everyone but me.



I remembered him bringing me hot soup when I pulled all-nighters in the studio, his hand gently rubbing my back as I hunched over blueprints.



I remembered when I got pneumonia, so sick I could barely stand. He stayed by my hospital bed for three days straight, not sl\*\*ping, just watching over me.



He proposed to me in that hospital room, his voice cracking with a vulnerability I'd never seen before.



""I can't lose you, Elana,"" he'd whispered, his forehead pressed against mine. ""I can't imagine my life without you.""



I found out later his mother had died in a hospital just like that one. His fear felt real, his love absolute.



We got married right after graduation. His tech startup exploded, and he became the man everyone wanted to be. I built my own career, but I always put him first. I changed my own five-year plan for him, for us.



And all this time, he had another family.



That love, that devotion I believed was reserved only for me, was a lie. A performance.



My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was him. I stared at his name on the screen, my hand trembling. I finally answered.



""Hey, where are you?"" His voice was warm, the same loving tone he always used with me.



In the background, I could hear the faint sound of a baby crying, then Hayden's voice soothing the child.



I stood across the street from the church, watching him through the open doors. He was holding his phone to his ear, smiling as he spoke to me.



""I'm just out for a walk,"" I managed to say, my own voice sounding foreign and brittle.



""I got held up at a last-minute meeting,"" he said smoothly. ""I'll be home soon. I miss you.""



The lie was so easy for him. It slid out, polished and perfect, just like everything else about him. A tear finally broke free and slid down my cheek, hot against my cold skin. All those business trips, the late nights at the office. How many of them were spent here, with them?



How could I have been so blind?



I swallowed the lump in my throat, forcing my voice to be steady. ""Emilio, I need to see you.""



He hesitated. I could see him shift his weight, his smile faltering for just a second. ""I'm still in the meeting, baby. Can it wait until I get home?""



""No.""



Just then, the little boy, Leo, toddled over and wrapped his arms around Emilio's leg.



""Daddy!"" the child squealed.



Emilio's eyes widened in panic. He quickly bent down, trying to shush the boy while keeping his voice low and calm for me. ""It's just... the kid of one of my colleagues.""



The phone went dead. He had hung up on me.



I watched as he scooped the boy into his arms, ki\*\*ing his cheek and whispering something that made the child giggle. He looked so natural, so at ease. Such a good father.



My heart felt like it had been scooped out, leaving nothing but a hollow, aching void. Years of my life, of my love, felt like a joke.



I pulled out my phone again, my fingers moving on their own. I didn't call Ayla, my best friend. I didn't call my lawyer.



I called the director of the Zurich Architectural Fellowship. A prestigious, six-month program I had been accepted to but deferred for Emilio. A program that required complete, uninterrupted focus. Total isolation.



""I'd like to accept the fellowship,"" I said, my voice eerily calm. ""I can leave immediately.""





Chapter 2

""The fellowship is still available, Elana. We'd be thrilled to have you."" The director's voice was warm on the other end of the line. ""But you understand the conditions? Six months, complete isolation. No outside contact.""



""I understand,"" I said. It was exactly what I needed. A place to disappear.



""We can have everything arranged for you,"" he promised. ""Just let us know your travel plans.""



""Thank you,"" I said, a flicker of something like hope cutting through the numbness. ""I'll see you in Zurich.""



I hung up and drove straight home. Our home.



The front door opened into a living room filled with symbols of our life together. A pair of matching coffee mugs on the counter. A framed photo of us on our wedding day on the mantelpiece, his arm wrapped tightly around me. A cashmere throw blanket he'd bought for me, draped over the sofa where we used to cuddle and watch movies.



A wave of revulsion washed over me.



I grabbed a ga\*\*age bag from the kitchen and started moving through the house like a storm. The mugs went in first, shattering at the bottom of the bag. The photo frame followed, the glass cracking. I tore every picture of us from its frame, ripped them into tiny pieces, and threw them in. The blanket, his clothes in my closet, the st\*\*id little trinkets he'd brought back from his ""business trips.""



Everything went into the bags. I dragged them to the curb, a cleansing fire of rage burning through me.



Then I started packing. My clothes, my books, my architectural models. Everything that was mine. I arranged for a shipping company to pick them up and deliver them to my old apartment, the one I had kept as a studio space.



Emilio didn't come home that night.



He walked in the next evening, looking tired but smiling. He dropped his briefcase and pulled me into an embrace, his arms wrapping around me like nothing was wrong.



""God, I missed you,"" he murmured into my hair, his lips brushing my temple.



My body went rigid. I could smell the faint, sweet scent of a different woman's perfume on his shirt. All I could picture was him holding that baby, ki\*\*ing Hayden Cleveland. Nausea rose in my throat.



I pushed myself out of his arms.



His smile faded, replaced by a look of concern. ""What's wrong, Elana? You feel cold.""



""I'm fine,"" I said, my voice flat.



""You're not fine,"" he insisted, his brow furrowed. ""Are you sick? Let's go to the doctor.""



The hypocrisy was suffocating. He could play the part of the concerned husband so perfectly, even after spending the night with his other family.



""I'm not sick,"" I said. ""I'm just tired.""



He didn't push it. Instead, he pulled a series of gift-wrapped boxes from his briefcase. ""I brought you presents. From my trip.""



He had even faked the evidence of a business trip. A silk scarf from a designer I hated. A bottle of perfume I would never wear. Each gift was a carefully constructed lie, a testament to the depth of his deception. The cost of these gifts could probably fund a small startup, but the thought behind them was worthless.



I wanted to scream, to throw the boxes in his face and demand to know how he could do this. But the words wouldn't come. I was trapped between the woman who still, somewhere deep down, loved the man he used to be, and the woman who was drowning in the truth of who he was now.



He noticed my silence, the redness in my eyes.



""What is it, Elana? Talk to me.""



I looked him straight in the eye, my voice hard. ""I want a baby, Emilio. I want one now.""



His face changed. A flicker of panic, then a mask of weary patience. ""We've talked about this. The timing is just not right.""



""It's never the right time for you,"" I shot back.



""The company just launched a new initiative. I'm under a lot of pressure."" The same excuse. Always the same.



""You don't think I'm under pressure?"" I insisted, my voice rising. ""I want a child, Emilio. With you.""



His phone rang, saving him. The caller ID was blank. He glanced at it, his expression turning serious.



""It's work,"" he said, already turning away. ""I have to go."" A lie. I knew it was a lie.



He ki\*\*ed my forehead, a gesture that now felt like a brand of his betrayal. ""I'll be back late. Don't wait up.""



I watched from the window as he got into his car and sped away, disappearing into the night.



I collapsed onto the sofa, the fight draining out of me, leaving only a bone-deep ache. He could have a child with her, but not with me. The thought was a physical blow.



My gaze fell on his second phone, the one he claimed was ""for international business,"" lying on the coffee table. He'd forgotten it in his haste. The screen lit up with a message.



From Hayden: ""Leo's fever is back. He keeps asking for his daddy.""



He hadn't even noticed I was different. That the house was half-empty. That his wife's heart was breaking.



A single tear rolled down my cheek, then another. The pain in my heart was so intense it was a physical sensation, but it was overshadowed by a sudden, violent cramp in my stomach.



I lurched forward, my hand flying to my mouth as I ran for the bathroom, retching into the toilet.



My body felt strange. This wasn't just heartbreak. A cold, terrifying thought began to form in my mind. A possibility that was both a miracle and a curse.



He didn't come home that night.



The next morning, I went to the hospital alone.



The doctor smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she looked at the ultrasound screen.



""Congratulations, Mrs. Thomas,"" she said, her voice bright with a joy I couldn't feel. ""You're six weeks pr\*\*nant.""





Chapter 3

I walked out of the doctor's office in a daze, her cheerful words echoing in the sterile hallway. Pr\*\*nant. Six weeks. I placed a hand on my still-flat stomach, a tear slipping from the corner of my eye.



This tiny, innocent life. Why now? Why did it have to choose this moment to arrive, in the middle of this wreckage?



As I reached the end of the long corridor, a familiar silhouette made me freeze.



It was Emilio. He was standing near the elevators, his arm wrapped around Hayden Cleveland, who was sobbing into his ch\*\*t. He was murmuring words of comfort, his expression filled with a tender concern I hadn't seen directed at me in a long, long time.



I ducked behind a large potted plant, my heart pounding. I couldn't hear their words clearly, but his actions spoke volumes.



Then, Hayden's choked wh\*\*per carried down the hall. ""Do you think she suspects anything?""



""She trusts me,"" Emilio replied, his voice casual, dismissive. It was a careless statement that revealed everything about how little he thought of me, of my intelligence.



""But when will you make me your wife?"" Hayden pressed, her voice laced with a desperate ambition. ""When can you give me and Leo the life we deserve?""



""Hayden, stop,"" he cut her off, a hint of steel in his tone. ""Elana is my wife. That will not change.""



My breath caught in my throat.



""It's the least I can do,"" he continued, his voice softer now, tinged with what sounded like guilt. ""It's my penance for what I've done to her.""



Hayden fell silent, accepting his decision with a reluctant nod. He pulled her into another hug, ki\*\*ing her hair.



""You gave me a beautiful son, Hayden,"" he said, his voice thick with emotion. ""And I will always take care of you both.""



They walked towards the elevator, their arms around each other. As the doors were about to close, Hayden's eyes flickered in my direction. For a split second, her gaze met mine. There was no surprise in her eyes, only a flash of cold, triumphant victory.



She knew. She had known I was there the whole time.



I stepped out from behind the plant, my body trembling. The tears I'd been holding back streamed down my face, hot and unstoppable. The pain in my ch\*\*t was a physical weight, crushing me.



He didn't want to divorce me out of guilt, but he would never give up his other family. What did that make me? A placeholder? A symbol of a commitment he no longer felt but was too cowardly to break?



I remembered his promises, his vows. ""In sickness and in health, till death do us part."" He had said them with such conviction. I had believed him.



But he had betrayed me. And this love, this toxic, fractured thing, was something I had to cut out of my life.



Before I left the hospital, I walked back to the front desk and scheduled an appointment. An abortion.



Then I called my lawyer.



""Draw up the divorce papers,"" I said, my voice cold and steady. ""I want everything split down the middle. Everything I am entitled to.""



I was sitting in my car in the hospital parking lot when my phone rang. It was Emilio. His voice was hoarse, tired.



""Happy birthday, Elana.""



I had completely forgotten. In the chaos and the pain, my own birthday had slipped my mind.



""I'm so sorry about last night,"" he said, his voice laced with practiced regret. ""A crisis at the office. I didn't get home at all.""



A bitter laugh almost escaped my lips. ""Okay,"" I said, the two words feeling like dust in my mouth.



He seemed to relax on the other end, relieved by my lack of questions. ""I've arranged a gala for you tonight. To celebrate your birthday and the new wing you designed for the museum. To make it up to you.""



""Okay,"" I repeated, my voice a monotone.



A year ago, those words would have made me cry with happiness. Now, they were just another layer to his elaborate lie.



I didn't want to hear his voice anymore. I hung up the phone, my hand gripping a steering wheel.



I looked out the window, but I didn't see anything. I just felt a deep, chilling premonition. He had no idea what was coming. He felt a sense of unease, a feeling that something precious was slipping through his fingers, but he couldn't name it.



He had no idea it was already gone.





Chapter 4

When I got home, a team of stylists and makeup artists was waiting for me. Emilio had arranged everything. They fussed over me, transforming my grief-stricken face into a mask of polished elegance, dressing me in a gown of midnight blue silk.



At dusk, Emilio arrived, his own tuxedo perfectly tailored. His eyes lit up when he saw me, a look of genuine awe on his face.



""You look breathtaking, Elana.""



I just gave him a cool, detached glance and let him lead me to the car.



The gala was at the museum, in the very wing I had spent two years of my life designing. We walked in to a ripple of applause, our entrance met with smiles and envious glances.



""You're so lucky,"" a woman I knew whispered as we passed. ""To have a man who adores you so much.""



I used to revel in that envy. I used to feel a thrill of pride, knowing I had what every woman wanted. Tonight, I knew the beautiful surface was just a cover for the dark, rotting abyss beneath.



Emilio played his part perfectly, his hand possessively on the small of my back, his eyes full of a love that was a lie. He presented his gift, a heavy box from a famous jeweler. Inside was a diamond watch from a brand I had once told him I disliked.



He had forgotten. Or perhaps, he was remembering someone else's favorite.



""I don't..."" I started to say, but I was cut off as a small body collided with my legs.



I stumbled back, catching myself on a table.



""Daddy!"" a child's voice cried out.



My heart seized. It was Leo. He was clinging to Emilio's leg, his face buried in the expensive fabric of his trousers, sobbing.



""You're too close to my daddy!"" he wailed, pointing an accusing finger at me. ""Are you going to make him leave me and Mommy?""



The entire hall fell silent. Every eye was on us.



I wanted the ground to swallow me whole. The child looked so much like Emilio, the resemblance was undeniable.



Whispers erupted around the room. ""Is that... his son?"" ""Who is she, then?""



My carefully constructed world, the one I had fought so hard to maintain, was shattering in public, under the bright lights of my own celebration.



Emilio's face was a mask of controlled panic. He knelt, his voice patient. ""Whose little boy are you? Where are your parents?""



This only made the child cry harder.



Then, Hayden Cleveland pushed through the crowd, her face a picture of maternal distress. ""Oh, I am so, so sorry! Leo, honey, come to Mommy.""



She tried to pull the boy away, but he clung to Emilio, his little face a mess of tears and accusations.



I recognized her from the church, from the photos online. She was even more beautiful in person, her performance of the flustered, apologetic mother flawless. But I could see the calculation in her eyes.



""Daddy, don't let her take me away!"" Leo screamed, his voice echoing in the silent room. He glared at me, his eyes filled with a pure, childish hatred. ""It's her! She's the one trying to steal you from us!""



I was frozen, stunned into silence.



My eyes fell to the child's wrist. He was wearing a small string of sandalwood beads, a miniature version of the one I had spent a week on a pilgrimage to a remote temple to get for Emilio, for his protection, for his peace of mind.



He had given my gift to his son.



A surge of rage, hot and powerful, broke through my shock. I took a step forward, my hand outstretched, needing to see, to confirm. ""That bracelet...""



""Elana, don't!""



A powerful force slammed into my ch\*\*t. It was Emilio. He had shoved me, hard. His face was twisted in a panic I had never seen before, his eyes wild as he shielded his son.



My high heels caught on the plush carpet. I fell backwards, my body clumsy and out of control.



My head hit the sharp corner of a glass table with a sickening crack.



The world exploded in a shower of splintering glass and searing pain. Shards from a broken w\*\*e glass sliced into my arm. I gasped, the air knocked from my lungs.



I looked up, my vision blurring. Emilio wasn't looking at me. He was fussing over Leo, who had a tiny scratch on his knee.



""Are you okay, son? Did the bad woman hurt you?"" he murmured, his voice thick with concern. He scooped the boy into his arms and pushed through the crowd toward the exit, Hayden following closely behind.



She glanced back at me, a flicker of pure, triumphant malice in her eyes. It was a look that confirmed everything. This was all her plan.



Emilio left without a single look back. He left me bleeding on the floor of the room built to honor me.



The pain in my head and my arm was sharp, but a new, deeper, more terrifying cramp was seizing my abdomen.



The whispers around me grew louder, turning into a tide of judgment.



""Did you see that? She tried to grab the little boy.""



""She must be the other woman. How shameless, to cause a scene like this.""



""Emilio Thomas is such a good man, protecting his son like that.""



The words were a physical assault, each one a new wound.



The pain in my stomach intensified, a brutal, tearing sensation. I looked down. The midnight blue of my dress was stained with a spreading patch of dark, wet crimson.



My baby.



The last thread of my strength snapped. The room tilted, the lights blurring into streaks as the world faded to black.
