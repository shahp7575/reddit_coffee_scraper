1m16z1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartupIdeasIndia/comments/1m16z1f/startup_success_begins_with_a_wellmaintained/,Startup Success Begins with a Well-Maintained Office: Here’s the Ultimate Checklist,"https://preview.redd.it/dukg2mj827df1.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f220850d08c92dae8d6570f0af04d560cbdf6b22

When you think of startup success, your mind likely jumps to funding rounds, pitch decks, or viral marketing campaigns. But what if we told you that your path to sustainable growth actually starts with something far more foundational—**office maintenance**?

A clean, safe, and well-organized workplace isn’t just about aesthetics. It plays a pivotal role in employee productivity, workplace culture, and client perception. Yet, many startup founders overlook this core area while chasing aggressive growth targets. And the result? Operational hiccups, health hazards, and an environment that undermines team performance.

If you’re running or scaling a startup, this guide is for you. We’re diving into **the ultimate office maintenance checklist** to keep your space thriving and your people empowered. Because the way you maintain your office says a lot about how you run your business.

# Why Office Maintenance Matters for Startups

Startups are built on innovation, agility, and talent. But none of that functions well in a cluttered, poorly maintained space.

Imagine walking into a boardroom with flickering lights, dusty chairs, or a malfunctioning HVAC system. Even if your product is revolutionary, the environment will speak louder—and not in a good way.

Proper office maintenance ensures:

* Employee well-being and morale
* Professional image for visiting clients or partners
* Reduced safety hazards and liabilities
* Increased asset longevity (e.g., IT equipment, furniture, HVAC)
* Improved focus and productivity

And for startups operating with lean teams and tight margins, small lapses can lead to **big distractions**—and lost revenue.

# The Ultimate Office Maintenance Checklist: What Thriving Startups Must Prioritize

Let’s break down your office upkeep into manageable, strategic categories.

**1. Daily Essentials**

These are the tasks that keep the workspace clean, healthy, and professional on a daily basis.

* Empty trash bins and recycling
* Sanitize high-touch areas (door handles, desks, equipment)
* Clean restrooms and replenish supplies
* Inspect entryways and ensure they’re clutter-free
* Check coffee stations, kitchens, and break areas for hygiene

Why it matters: **Daily maintenance is a reflection of company culture**. Employees who walk into a clean and orderly space are more likely to respect it—and each other.

**2. Weekly Priorities**

These tasks focus on deeper cleanliness and systems that can degrade if ignored.

* Vacuum carpets and mop floors
* Inspect plumbing (leaks, clogged sinks, water pressure)
* Clean windows and indoor plants
* Organize communal spaces (conference rooms, storage)
* Wipe down monitors, keyboards, and shared devices

Why it matters: Routine cleaning reduces **long-term wear and tear** and prevents small issues from becoming major problems.

**3. Monthly Maintenance**

This category involves a more strategic review of your office’s overall performance.

1. Service HVAC systems
2. Test fire alarms, extinguishers, and emergency lights
3. Replace air filters
4. Deep clean upholstery and vents
5. Conduct an office-wide safety check

Why it matters: These tasks support **health compliance, legal safety standards**, and long-term asset performance—critical for employee well-being and operational continuity.

**4. Quarterly and Annual Checks**

These are the strategic and infrastructure-related items that should be planned ahead.

* Review service contracts with vendors and maintenance providers
* Perform pest control treatments
* Audit lighting systems and energy usage
* Inspect ceilings, roofing, and structural areas
* Plan office space upgrades or expansions
* Update equipment, software, and workstation ergonomics

Why it matters: Long-term maintenance supports **scalability and sustainability**. A proactive approach avoids unexpected costs and downtime.

# Don't Overlook Compliance and Accessibility

Startups often work with limited administrative bandwidth. But ignoring compliance, accessibility, or emergency preparedness can expose your company to **costly lawsuits or regulatory penalties**.

A few questions to consider:

* Is your office ADA-compliant?
* Are your fire exits clearly marked and accessible?
* Are all electrical systems and appliances up to code?
* Are emergency supplies stocked and visible?

Regularly reviewing compliance alongside your checklist ensures your business is both **safe and legally sound**—a must for investors and future partners.

# The Hidden ROI of Office Maintenance

Still not convinced this should be on your radar? Here’s what effective office maintenance brings to the table:

* **Employee retention**: People want to work in a clean, comfortable environment
* **Brand perception**: Your space reflects your values to clients, investors, and recruits
* **Reduced equipment downtime**: Well-maintained assets last longer and fail less often
* **Cost savings**: Preventative upkeep is almost always cheaper than emergency fixes
* **Compliance confidence**: No scrambling before inspections or investor visits

For small to mid-sized businesses, office upkeep becomes a **strategic asset**, not just an operational cost.

# How Startups Can Delegate Maintenance Without Losing Control

One of the biggest concerns for founders is **time**. You can’t spend your day checking air filters or inspecting fire extinguishers. That’s why many high-growth startups either:

* Assign office management responsibilities to an operations lead
* Use outsourced facility management providers
* Automate tasks via digital maintenance software or checklists
* Conduct quarterly “maintenance sprints” with the team

Whatever model works for you, the key is **documentation and consistency**. Keeping a shared checklist or using simple task management tools like Trello, Notion, or Asana can make a huge difference.

# Your Startup’s Growth Deserves a Space That Grows With It

Think of your office space as a **silent team member**—either helping or hurting your mission every single day. By integrating maintenance into your business strategy, you’re investing in productivity, reputation, and long-term performance.

At **BrightPath Associates LLC**, we understand that thriving startups don’t just need visionary leadership—they need a foundation that’s safe, functional, and ready for scale. That’s why we don’t just help with **executive recruitment**—we support **workplace excellence** across the board.

# Conclusion

In the startup world, momentum is everything. But behind every product launch and funding milestone is a **well-run, well-maintained workspace**. It’s not just about looking good—it’s about operating at your best.",1,1752653582.0,StartupIdeasIndia,0,1.0,False
1m16xgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1m16xgw/i_wonder_if_ill_ever_get_engaged/,I wonder if I’ll ever get engaged,"
I’m in a stable relationship with my partner for almost 3 years already (W30/W31). We came from long term relationships. Siya 4 years with a v pretty ex. And ako, from 6 years rel which didn’t work out. We’ve been living together for almost 2 years now and just recently we got our own place. 

We’re out to everyone even my homophobic parents know (my mom is just tolerating while my dad is transitioning to accepting). My partner’s entire family knows me and we’ve both met each other’s valued circle of friends. 

Yesterday, one of her lesbian friends got engaged. Nagpropose sa gf nyang ldr. Binisita nya sa ibang bansa tas don nagpropose. 

I know same sex relationships have it different due to societal conditions. Ke maengage di naman pwede magpakasal dito. Best we can get is the common law partner thingy. 

We never really talk about this since I’m afraid to put the pressure on her. But it made me wonder. Will I ever get engaged? Will she ever propose to me? Does she see me as a life partner? 

Last night, she opened a tube of coffee beat. Yung plastic tinali-tali nya para magmukhang singsing. Nanunuod kami ng Sinners tapos sabi nya sakin, here’s your engagement ring. I didn’t know how to react but I gave her my left hand so she can put it in my ring finger. Sabi ko, oh no it’s not my size! It’s too big! Hehe. Tumawa lang kami both. 

I kept the plastic because I feel like that’s the best I will get.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk. I’m going to go out for a run before these thoughts consume me. ",2,1752653415.0,WLW_PH,1,1.0,False

I realized that these little rituals—waking up, brewing a cup, and savoring that first sip—are a load more comforting than I ever gave them credit for. To the stranger out there who might be feeling overwhelmed by everything life throws your way, take a moment and let yourself notice the small, beautiful things. 

Maybe it's the smile of someone you love, a hot shower on a chilly morning, or even the way your cat curls up next to you on the couch. It's crazy how much peace and happiness these overlooked treasures can bring. We so often chase the big things that we forget they ain't the only things that matter. 

So, here's to finding joy in the simple, often overlooked moments and feeling connected—even if it's just through shared human experiences. Who knew gratitude could be this powerful, right? ☕✨",1,1752653414.0,dearUnknowns,0,1.0,False

My life of living with that and researching it endlessly has made me able to spot similarities in others.

I've been talking with my aunt about mental health. I started to wonder about her diagnoses. If I told her about ASD she would be receptive. She doesn't know a lot about ASD in women.

My aunt was born in the 80s. Doctors said she had BPD as a teen. She got ECT a few times. She had burnouts, needed isolation (sensory problems, averse to socializing). She had a high education, had very high income, moved far away and lived alone with her cats mostly isolated at home. A decade ago she burnt out and it led to early retirement. 

She's had a VERY structured, routine life with no going out except to doctors or one store where she only buys the same thing. Her mom moved in with her and does a lot for her like cooking, groceries and many bills. No hobbies (basically only deal hunts/shops online all day every day, seriously, like 10 hours of it for interior decorating).

* Blunt, no tact, and 100% honest to a fault. Never ever lies like she can't.
* Weird fixations on items or random topics, one track mind, pedantic about tiny details

* Hyper senses. No scents allowed in her home, some make her breaks out in hives. Melts down from too much noise or certain trigger smells
* Extremely picky eater, must be the exact same as last time or she won't eat it. Must be certain brand or appearance, flavor, texture
   * Same dish, same utensils, same cups, same routine like coffee, must have 2 cups by certain time, must have bottles of iced water with lemon the same way each day at the same time
* Get hung up/obsessed with details or patterns, misses the big picture.

* Doesn't do small talk. Only talks with a purpose
* As a child was a deep thinker, fixed interests, ""old soul,"" extreme empathy, sense of justice, love for animals (saved a bee with a broken wing at 3 years old).
* ""Gifted"" child, offered to skip grades, highly intelligent/booksmart/vocab but verbal situations were hard, high social anxiety
* She had cats her whole life and was an animal whisperer w/ deep empathy (common ASD thread, preferring animals to people)
* Has same TV shows on repeat, same music like 3 bands on repeat. Does not get bored or want something new.
* Never able to be spontaneous. Everything must be planned WAY ahead of time, if she doesn't have it planned, she can't do it
* No kids. She only ever had one long-term boyfriend who was probably also ND

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like craft, do DIY, By the way And I like video games, I love autumn and winter, although lately I am enjoying this hot summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I can also be a bore and sometimes not very talkative if I’m fixated on work haha, Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, still say hi!

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

1m16ngk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m16ngk/i_f25_regret_leaving_my_husband_m27_to_stay_in_a/,I (F25) regret leaving my husband (M27) to stay in a hotel and initiating a divorce.,"I initially shared this in r/advice but found this subreddit, so I’m copying and pasting it from my original post there:

I don’t know where to begin. It’s 2 a.m. and I cannot imagine my future or where I go from here.

Monday I (25F) had a job interview. I had quit my other job at the end of May and my husband (27M) has been supporting us for the last seven weeks while I have been applying and interviewing with new places.

For context, I recently had a job interview at a different place where my tattoos were mentioned.

Flash forward to Monday, and I was excited about this last round in-person interview I had scheduled that afternoon. My husband kept coming into the bathroom going back and forth on whether or not he could take me whilst I was getting ready and I said thats no big deal I just need the space to focus and mentally prepare and finish getting ready. When I was done in the bathroom, my husband complimented me, but then immediately started questioning my attire due to my arm tattoos being visible. I was confident in what I was wearing based on the ‘vibe’ of the place and I had already been screened via Zoom with my interviewers wearing the exact same thing.

He continuously kept going in on how I shouldn’t wear a shorter sleeve blouse and wear a turtle neck and it was really overwhelming me and I kept saying please stop, I’m confident in what I am wearing and I’m really nervous and need to leave soon and want to focus on eating my lunch. He continued and things escalated. I regrettably lost my cool while he continued saying my earrings aged me and how the blouse was wrong and I smashed my bowl that had my rice in it into our coffee table, which is where I was eating, while shouting stfu.

Immediate regret. My husband took a picture of the broken bowl on the table, before I could clean it which set me on edge, because I knew if I went to this job interview he would send it to his family and friends. I know what I did was wrong. I cleaned everything up and had to leave. Stupidly, I blocked his number because I was overwhelmed and didn’t even know if I could do the interview, but after speaking with my mom she told me to go.

After the interview I spoke to my mom on the phone and she asked if I thought he was cheating, because of how quick the switch up was from being excited to criticizing what I was wearing. This also put me on edge, because last night I had had that thought when he had put his phone away quickly when I came into the room.

A few years ago, when we had moved to a new city, there was an incident with a female coworker where my husband had taken a call and lied saying it was his dad. I knew it was a lie because where his dad lives it would have been 2 a.m. This unearthed a series of text exchanges they had made daily, which he had been proactively hiding and deleting from me as I had asked multiple times before this phone call to distance himself from this coworker since she was cheating on her fiance with a different coworker of their’s.

This is what was running through my head, when I entered our apartment on Monday after my interview and after speaking to my mom, and I said to him I think you’re emotionally cheating again let me see your phone. He initially refused saying I could look at his laptop which for me I interpreted as a red flag. Eventually he conceded and he gave me the phone where I found text exchanges back and forth with a female coworker stemming from early March until that Sunday. These were surface level exchanges, but I felt hurt because he had sent her a pic of her favorite candy and sent pictures of him and his twin as kids (this coworker is also a twin) and my thinking was why is he feeling the need to do this with someone?

I mentioned the thread and he got defensive which I felt like was another red flag, given what had happened a few years prior, idk. He took my phone off of me when I was trying to leave so I went to our apartment buildings rooftop patio for space. I guess he tried answering my mom’s calls to me on my phone. He eventually met me upstairs and returned my phone. Obviously at this point we both were angry and frustrated at each other.

Shortly after, I went back to our apartment and said I was staying in a hotel that night. He tried calling his mom, so she could speak with me which is something he had done when the phone call was lied about three years ago, but I just kept my headphones on and quietly told him I was sick of being disrespected and was going.

Again, I know me slamming the bowl and immediately accusing him was wrong. I went to the hotel and fucked up more by keeping him blocked on everything except email. My mom had let me know once I got to the hotel that he was trying to contact her and was saying he didn’t know where I was. He also on the phone with my mom said twice I had thrown the bowl at him and then finally told the truth about me slamming it down on the table.

I emailed him letting him know I was at a hotel and not to contact me or my family and friends unless it was an emergency. I had downloaded divorce forms offline and researched the process Monday evening. We have been together in total 7 years with having been married for 1 year.

I felt certain in the moment this is what I wanted, so I sent them to him along with a doc listing what I wanted from the apartment. I want to make it clear I didn’t file anything in the system, I had downloaded forms that were examples of what we would have to file with the clerk.

We ended up meeting in-person at 4 p.m. the next day to discuss filing. This led to a 4.5 hour conversation with a lot of tears from both sides. He explained to me that he told his entire family about everything (I had deleted my whatsapp account in the heat of the moment which had removed me from all of his family’s groupchats) and had told them I needed to go back to therapy (I just started therapy last week) and he also had said the same to his friends in addition to sharing the picture. He admitted he wished we hadn’t gotten family and friends involved because he didn’t know how we could come back from this with them knowing all of this. He suggested we could lie and say I was having a manic episode which I immediately shot down. (I don’t have Bipolar to be clear I have OCD, PTSD, and ADHD, but definitely not Bipolar or anything else.)

I told him I regretted acting on emotion throughout all of it. We are staying in our apartment tonight with me on the couch bed and him in our bed, and we discussed one of us possibly leaving for a week and deciding what we want to do at the end of the week or seeing how we feel in a few weeks.

I am such a fuck up. I have ruined this because I let my frustration and bitterness take over me. We were supposed to go visit his side of the family and plan our wedding ceremony and reception (we only did the legal union last year with him and i and a friend as our witness) which we both agreed he will visit his family and I won’t be going. I shouldn’t have listened to my mom, she’s my only parent but I know she holds massive grudges with people, so I should have been weary of her influence. I should’ve just spoken to my husband’s mom or gone for a walk instead of spiraling and going to a hotel and downloading divorce forms.

I know I am going to lose him and it is my own fault. I don’t know how we would repair this, even though I wish I could take the whole day back. I’ve been so overwhelmed by trying to find a new job, we recently moved apartments, I don’t have a relationship with my extended family and I have been caught in the middle of feuding between my mom and her mom and brothers, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I’m going to have no family at our wedding because my dad passed away when I was young, so its my mom, sister, and I, again no relationship/ tense relationship with my extended family. My birthday is on Monday and I just don’t know how I can face down another year earth side, when I have fucked up this much.

I don’t know what advice I am seeking, but I don’t feel like I have a neutral adult or person to turn to right now. My husband is saying this will take time and we could heal from it but we also don’t know what that holds, but then I also can see that for him this could be the nail in the coffin. I know his whole family hates me and I know his friends all do as well.

I don’t know what to do from here. What would your advice be for me to try and reconcile? Or do you think it is hopeless? 

TLDR: I left my husband to stay in a hotel for the evening after an argument before a job interview and an argument taking place after the interview. I regret acting solely on my emotions and not having better self control. I don’t know if my husband had any faults in this situations, but I’m seeking advice on what I can do from here if I want to try and make things work and to get a neutral third party perspective on the situation as its shared in its entirety.

2. **Orchard** – Tucked away in the scenic Rajpur area, Orchard offers a lovely garden setting with a mix of Tibetan and Continental brunch options. The view and peaceful setting really elevate the experience.
3. **Cafe de Piccolo** – Known for its European cottage-style interiors, this place is a Dehradun brunch staple. Great coffee, sandwiches, pancakes, and a perfect place to catch up with friends or bring a book.

I’m not talking about just a few scoops now and then. Is there anyone here who has used Nakpro consistently for 3–4 months, made it their main/only protein source, and actually seen good visible results (muscle growth, recovery, strength)?",6,1752651839.0,Fitness_India,9,1.0,False

On our seventh wedding anniversary, my husband Archer Leonel stood me up and sent me an ""anniversary gift"" instead—a newborn baby, still covered in amniotic fluid.  
  
  
I ignored the crying outside my door and dumped the cold dinner straight into the trash—just like the last bit of love I had.  
  
  
Archer's call came through. ""You got the kid, right? Stop giving Hayley such a hard time anymore. She's already given you her child! What the hell else do you want from her?""  
  
  
""Jesus, Karen, can you be more understanding? if you weren’t useless in bed and couldn’t give me a child, I wouldn’t need another woman?""  
  
  
""We’ve carried the Leonel name for seven generations. Just take care of mine and Hayley's baby. Once I finish helping her with her studies abroad, I'll come back and throw the wedding you’ve been begging for.""  
  
  
I responded calmly, ""Fine.""  
  
  
Then I immediately contacted a couple from the slums of Africa. ""Hey, I heard you're looking to adopt a child?""  
  
  
At that moment, a text message popped up on my phone: ""Karen Silkisia, if you don't marry me, I swear to God I'll kill myself!""  
  
  
...  
  
  
I took one last look at this hollow house and replied, ""I do. I'll marry you.""  
  
  
He called back immediately, practically bouncing with excitement. ""I'm picking you up right now!""  
  
  
Three years later, I returned to New York with my child for a business expansion.  
  
  
At JFK, I ran straight into Archer and Hayley Corbella, fresh off their flight back to the States.  
  
  
Archer shoved his suitcase at me like it was expected.  
  
  
""Well, look who's being thoughtful for once. How'd you know we were coming back today?""  
  
  
Before I could answer, he frowned with irritation. ""And why have your texts been so damn weird these past few years? Only time you made sense was asking for money!""  
  
  
I almost smirked.  
  
  
When I left New York, I'd tossed my phone to some homeless guy on the street—God knows who'd been texting him back.  
  
  
Not bothering to engage, I shoved his suitcase right back at him.  
  
  
""Wrong person.""  
  
  
I turned to leave, but Hayley spotted the sleeping child in the stroller and burst into tears, lunging forward.  
  
  
""My baby! Mommy's back! I'm so sorry Mommy met your daddy too late to be there for you properly.""  
  
  
She pushed past me and scooped up my son despite my protests.  
  
  
The kid—who definitely inherited his bio-dad's cranky wake-up attitude—immediately let out a wail.  
  
  
He thrashed around, his little feet kicking Hayley in the face.  
  
  
Crying ""Mommy!"" while reaching for me, which made panic and jealousy flash across Hayley's eyes.  
  
  
I rushed over to take him back, about to explain, ""Look, he's not your—""  
  
  
But Hayley stepped back, tears streaming down her face.  
  
  
""Karen, you promised you'd take good care of my baby. Why is he still so skinny and small at three years old?""  
  
  
Then she cooed to the struggling child, ""It's Mommy's fault. Mommy wasn't there for three years—I even didn't know you were suffering so much!""  
  
  
I was ready to roll my eyes, opening my mouth to say, ""You've got it wrong, he's only two—""  
  
  
SMACK.  
  
  
The next second, my face exploded in pain. I stared at Archer in disbelief.  
  
  
His face was twisted with rage. ""Karen Silkisia, I never thought you were this fucking evil. You promised us, and then you spent three years abusing mine and Hayley's child!""  
  
  
""I sent you nearly a million dollars over three years, and you couldn't even feed him right?""  
  
  
""Look how skinny and dark he is—this is supposed to be the Leonel heir!""  
  
  
A crowd had gathered around us, shaking their heads and whispering.  
  
  
Someone even pulled out their phone to livestream, ""Holy shit, y'all! Rich family catches their nanny abusing their kid!""  
  
  
I frowned, watching my still-crying child, and protectively yanked him away from Hayley.  
  
  
While I was busy comforting him, unable to explain to the crowd, Hayley suddenly shrieked, ""Karen, how could you give him a down pillows? You know I'm allergic to goose down!""  
  
  
""No wonder he's so weak—he's allergic just like me! Didn't you notice at all?""  
  
  
""Poor baby couldn't even talk to tell you—he suffered for three whole years. I guess it's different when it's not your own flesh and blood...""  
  
  
She dropped to her knees, full dramatic grieving mom mode.  
  
  
""Please, just give me back my son! I almost died bringing him into this world!""  
  
  
I wanted to laugh. That baby had been dumped at my door still covered in amniotic fluid, dumped at my door as a gift.  
  
  
These two had immediately fucked off to Europe for their romantic getaway, posting lovey-dovey pics on Instagram while I became everyone's favorite joke.  
  
  
If I hadn't heard the crying, that baby would've frozen to death outside.  
  
  
They couldn't even be bothered to feed their own child back then, and now they wanted to play loving parents?  
  
  
I set my jaw and put my son back in his stroller.  
  
  
Archer was livid. ""Karen, give Hayley back her kid. You can't even take care of a child—you don't deserve to be Mrs. Leonel anymore!""  
  
  
I smiled coldly. ""Like I ever wanted that bullshit title. I've been remarried for years!""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""Hayley's got her Harvard MBA now—she's way more qualified to be Mrs. Leonel than you'll ever be. If it weren't for the fact that you—""  
  
  
Archer was rambling on when my words finally hit him.  
  
  
He stopped mid-sentence. ""Wait, what the fuck did you just say?""  
  
  
Hayley stood there looking all understanding. ""Oh, Karen's just lashing out. I'm not trying to take anything from anyone—I just want to be with Archer and my baby. That's honestly all I care about.""  
  
  
Archer squeezed her hand, clearly moved. ""God, Hayley, you're always so thoughtful.""  
  
  
Then he looked me up and down with this smug expression.  
  
  
""Every single thing you're wearing—that Hermès bag, those Louboutins—I paid for all of it. Remarried, my ass.""  
  
  
""Who the hell else would bankroll your bougie lifestyle?""  
  
  
""Karen, Leonel Corp is worth billions now. If you don't want to lose everything you have, you better start treating Hayley with some respect!""  
  
  
""From now on, Hayley's moving in to bond with her son.""  
  
  
""Since you clearly suck at being a mom, let the real one take over!""  
  
  
Hayley shot me this triumphant look. Whatever. I ignored them both and checked the text from William Firenze:  
  
  
""Babe, still closing this deal in London. Sorry you're stuck with kiddo duty—I'll make it up to you when I get back! ?""  
  
  
Then my phone buzzed with a bank alert. Eight million dollars.  
  
  
""Afternoon shopping for my girl and our little one?""  
  
  
Followed by those puppy dog eyes emojis begging for praise.  
  
  
All the stress just melted away. I smiled and texted back: ""Miss you. Hurry home to us.""  
  
  
When I looked up, Hayley was trying to feed my son chocolate.  
  
  
""Here, sweetie, Mommy brought this special chocolate from Europe. Try it!""  
  
  
I practically flew at her, smacking that chocolate away. ""He's allergic, you idiot!""  
  
  
Suddenly, Hayley threw herself backward and screamed, ""ARCHER! SHE'S ATTACKING ME!""  
  
  
Archer shoved me so hard I went down, scrambling to catch his precious Hayley.  
  
  
The crowd's anger was getting louder. ""What kind of psycho nanny won't even let the real mom hold her own kid?""  
  
  
""Look how she's dressed—way fancier than her boss. Bet she's been stealing from them for years!""  
  
  
""...""  
  
  
Some little brat actually poured coffee on me. ""Bad lady! Bad lady!""

Hello to this world and people of Reddit!

I am from the southwest uk, but I have not lived there for a long time. I am travel fan and I am looking for friends all over the world!

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like craft, do DIY, By the way And I like video games, I love autumn and winter, although lately I am enjoying this hot summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I can also be a bore and sometimes not very talkative if I’m fixated on work haha, Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, still say hi!

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

1m16hcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m16hcm/something_is_following_me_and_its_getting_more/,"Something is following me, and it’s getting more confident…","Have you ever had the feeling that you’re being watched, like eyes are prying into you, trying to dig their way deep into your soul? Because that’s how I’ve felt for the past two days. I don’t know what to do, or how I can make it stop. I’ve never posted on something like this before, but at this point I’m willing to try anything, I’m desperate for some advice.

I’ll take you back to the start, or what I assume to be the start of it all. 

I live a fairly ordinary life. I’m a 21 year old guy, living on his own in a bit of a rundown flat, commuting to work on the train everyday. This doesn’t leave me a lot of spare time for anything else, really, because my commute is an hour each way. My days consist of waking up at 6:30, getting dressed, walking to the train station, catching the train, walking to work, working, and then doing the same process in reverse. That’s it. I don’t really have any friends to hang out with, and I’m not exactly on the best terms with my family (for reasons I won’t go into here), so I sit on my own each evening, watching TV or playing video games. I keep myself to myself, and get on with my life.

Now, you may be thinking that my life sounds pretty miserable or boring, but to me, it’s perfect. I’ve always been a bit of a loner, so my daily routine suits me perfectly, and I’ve been living happily like this for the past year. 

That is, until a dream I had 3 nights ago.

Like all dreams, it didn’t have a beginning. I was simply there, no recollection of opening my eyes in this new place, or how I’d got there. I was standing in the middle of a large grassy field. I could feel the wind blowing gently on my face, and I ran my hand through the large grass strands that stretched up from the ground to meet me. I looked around, and realized I was alone. The field was empty, save for a lone tree, a few hundred feet away from me. I started to make my way over to it, not knowing why I was doing so, but just having the feeling that there was something there I needed to see. As I got closer, I could make out the faint shape of letters carved into the wood. From where I was standing, I couldn’t quite make out what they were, and so I decided to get closer for a better look.

And that’s when I felt it for the first time. Even in my dream, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and a chill went down my spine. I could tell that I was no longer alone. Someone else was here, watching me. I span myself around, and caught the first glimpse of *them*. They were far away, so far away that all of their features were obscured by the distance. All I could make out was a featureless shadow, standing in the grass, watching me. I stood for what seemed like hours, just staring back at them, unsure of what to do. 

And then they started to run.

The figure lurched forwards with impossible speed, heading straight for me. Instinctively, I span back around and began to take off in the opposite direction, towards the tree. The words on the tree were becoming clearer, but I still couldn't make out what they were yet. As I ran through the grass, trying desperately not to trip on the uneven terrain, I glanced behind me to ascertain how much distance I had left between me and my pursuer.

Not much. 

It had impossible speed, coming at me like a steam train, closing the gap between us in a matter of seconds. It would only be a few more until it was on me. I began to panic and tried to pick up my pace, but as is the curse of most dreams, I was running at a snail's pace. My foot slipped, and I was sent crashing to the ground. I flipped over just in time to see my pursuer pouncing on top of me. I could see now that it was not the distance that had caused it to look featureless. It was featureless. Just a black hole of pure energy in the shape of a person. It brought its ‘hands’ up to my face, placing them on either side of my eyes. I began to cry and plead with it, begging it not to hurt me. It didn’t listen. Instead, it plunged it’s dark thumbs into my eye sockets, blocking my vision and causing me to scream out in pain.

And then I was awake, screaming still.

I scanned my room, looking for the creature, but I was alone.

“Fucking stupid nightmare.” I muttered to myself as I led back down, trying to slow my breathing and calm myself down. I managed to eventually get back to sleep, and awoke at 6:30 to my normal alarm buzzing next to me. I got up and began to get ready for work as normal, when my mind drifted back to my nightmare. I tried to think of the letters I had seen carved into the wood of the tree, but all I could remember were,

“Erom ecno niks ym no enihs”

There was still a lot more carved into it, but in my panic I couldn’t make out the rest. 

“Whatever,” I thought to myself.

I left my building and began my walk to the train station, the thoughts of my dream already beginning to fade from my memory, chalked up t o nothing more than a stupid dream caused by a scary video game or something. 

You’d be surprised by how quiet the streets are in a big town at 7am. No one trying to sell you things, no one bumping into you or pushing past, most of the time it’s just me and the road. Nice and quiet. It was the same on Thursday morning, but as I got closer to the train station, I began to get a familiar feeling. The hairs on the back of my neck began to stand up, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around slowly, hoping to just see another commuter making their way to work behind me.

The street was still clear, with no sign of anyone else having been there other than me. I breathed a sigh of relief and shook my head, thinking that the previous night’s dream was just playing tricks on my mind. However, as I began to turn my head back in the direction I was traveling, my eyes caught a glimpse of someone, standing behind a lamppost. Only half of their body was visible, the other half hidden behind the metal pole. They were standing about 200 meters from me, so I couldn’t easily make out any of their features. All I could see was an eye, glistening in the reflection of the streetlight. Whoever it was was watching me, motionless. I stood for a moment, debating what to do.

I brought my hands up to my face and momentarily covered my eyes as I rubbed them. When I removed my hands once more, the figure was gone.

I let out a faint laugh, cursing myself for being so stupid as to believe someone was watching me. It was most likely just someone making their way to work, just like me. They had momentarily stopped to look at me, the only other person on the street, just as I had done to them. And then they had moved on, got on with their day, just as I had to do now as well.

The rest of the day went by as usual, with nothing out of the ordinary to report, that is, until I was on the way home. I got on the train home as I normally would, and we set off back towards my home town. There are a number of stops between where the train begins and where it ends, with the carriages steadily becoming quieter and quieter as the journey progresses. By the time it reaches the final stop, I am normally the only person left in the carriage, which I am more than okay with, as it means no one has to sit next to me.

As the train slowed to ready itself for the next station, I felt my hairs stand on end once more. I sighed at myself. 

“Not again” I thought, wishing that my brain would stop playing tricks on me. It was clearly hanging onto the dream more than I had thought, and was not letting not go any time soon. The train slowed to a halt, and the doors hissed open to allow any passengers to get off. It was a quiet station in the evening, and so the platform was deserted, save for the shape of a lone person standing at the far end of the platform. It had been raining, and so my window was covered in thin streams of water, obscuring the figure and making it seem as though they were a strange shape - almost as if you were looking at yourself in a funhouse mirror. Their body seemed twisted and deformed, no longer even resembling the shape of a human. The thought of it sent more chills down my spine, and as the doors hissed shut and the train pulled off, I silently thanked the gods that we weren’t delayed.

When I climbed into bed that night, I prayed that my brain wouldn’t force me to experience another one of its concoctions, and that I would just be able to forget the whole thing had ever happened. But my mind, once again, had other plans.

I was standing in the middle of a crowded street, streams of people passing around me. I glanced down and found that I was dressed in my work clothes, consisting of a shirt, tie and smart pants. I felt at the tie, and let it slip through my fingers. The silk felt so real. I looked back up to the street and found myself surrounded by staring faces. Everyone had stopped what they were doing and were staring at me, their mouths hanging slightly open in a look of shock and awe. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. All those sat in coffee shops, in the flats above me, and in cars all stared at me through the glass of their windows, the same expressions resting on their faces. They were unmoving, unbreathing, unfeeling. All emission had drained from them, as though they were statues.

And then as one, they took a step closer. Faces squished against the windows as those inside the buildings tried to get closer, seemingly unaware there was something in the way. I began to panic as the space between me and the crowd lessened as they moved closer once more. They were a single organism, moving together as though the individual bodies were simply limbs controlled by one malevolent force. There was now only a meter between me and the nearest person, and this gap was closed before I was able to react. I felt hands grabbing at me, ripping my shirt, grasping my tie and pulling it, tightening it’s grip around my throat and cutting off my oxygen supply. 

“Please… stop!” I choked, pushing and shoving at the mass of bodies, desperate to get them away. I was met with a deafening reply, as every mouth began chanting the same thing. My memory of what they were saying is pretty hazy, but from what I can remember, it sounded something like,

“Uy ma e, em era uy”

The voices were dark, inhuman. I felt as though my eardrums would burst at the volume of the chanting, the vibrations reverberating through my body. I was being crushed from all sides, my clothes being ripped off, my skin being ripped at and scratched by unrelenting hands. I cried out in pain, and as with the previous night, I was awake, still screaming.

I looked at my hands and found that I was shaking. My ears were ringing, as though they had been exposed to a high volume in the night. I picked up my phone and checked the time - 5:47. 

“Screw it.” I thought to myself, there wasn’t a chance I was going back to sleep after that. I climbed out of bed and walked to my bathroom. I splashed cold water onto my face in an attempt to wake myself up and make me think rationally about the situation. All that had really happened was I had had a couple of bad dreams, and seen two people obscured by various things. That was it. Nothing unnatural about that. I breathed slower now, the rational side of my brain slowly beginning to take hold.

As I brought my head back up to look at myself in the mirror, I noticed a shadow standing in my shower, obscured by the shower curtain that had been pulled across. I gasped and my blood ran cold. I was frozen by fear as I stared into the reflection. Whoever was in the shower was facing the mirror as well, their shape clearly visible. They were unmoving, as still as a statue.

I slowly turned myself around to face the curtain, the shape of the intruder still visible. Tears began to form in my eyes as I reached out a hand. I grasped the fabric, and in one quick motion, yanked the curtain across to expose the figure.

It was empty. I let out an audible mix of relief and fear as I brought my shaking hands up to my head.

I went into work early that day.

I couldn’t really focus properly on what I was doing, my mind filled with thoughts of my follower. Whatever it was, it wasn’t a figment of my imagination. I had definitely seen a figure standing in my bathroom, watching me. It had been in my flat. Feet away from me.

I travelled home as usual, thankfully not having the feeling I was being watched at all. I stepped off the train onto the platform and followed the few others that had got off down the nearby stairs that led to the exit. The stairs lead down to a small tunnel under the station, lit by crappy lights that flicker occasionally. At the end of the tunnel is a corner where a set of stairs live, leading up to the entrance of the station. Next to this corner is a mirror, placed onto the wall near the ceiling, allowing you to see if anyone is about to turn the corner, preventing you from bumping into them. As I neared the corner, I glanced up at the mirror, and found that there was someone standing just round it. They were wearing a shirt that seemed to be two sizes too small for them and a tie that looked as though it was choking them. A mass of lumpy skin bulged through the gaps between the shirt’s buttons. I stopped in my tracks, just before the corner. I looked into the mirror closer, and even though they were hunched over, I could see that the person’s head was deformed, as though it was just piles of skin thrown together clumsily. I could hear it wheezing, as if the simple act of breathing was causing it immense pain. I could feel tears beginning to well in my eyes again as I felt my hairs stand on end once more.

“Shit, shit shit.” I whispered to myself, trying to hype myself up just enough to make the three steps to the turn. Every part of my body wanted to turn around and run in the opposite direction, but I resisted. I was startled by a shout from behind me, and turned around to see the cause, only to find a group of kids running down the steps, cheering and joking with each other. I turned back to face the mirror, and found that the figure was gone again. Just like in the morning. I took a few shaky steps forward and turned the corner, confirming that there was no one there.

And then last night, I had the worst dream yet.

I found myself standing back in my bathroom, brushing my teeth. I could taste the mint of the toothpaste as I brushed, spitting out the foam into the sink below. I brought my head back up and stared at myself in the mirror. I was met with a twisted, deformed version of myself, smiling maniacally at me. I stepped backwards, and he stepped forwards, his head protruding from the glass as though it were an open window. A crooked, broken hand reached up onto the frame, and in one smooth motion, the body slithered out pulling itself through. It flopped onto the sink, smacking its head onto the porcelain and causing it to bleed. I fell backwards as I retreated, stumbling into the bathtub. I sat and watched in horror as the being got to its feet, the bones cracking as it twisted it’s broken body around to face me. The mirror-me continued to smile as he began to move towards me. At this point, I was paralyzed with fear as he began the same chant as the previous night.

“Uy ma e, em era uy. Uy ma e, em era uy.”

“Please… please don’t hurt me!” I cried as the shaking, twisted hands reached out towards my face. I turned my face away from the creature and braced myself for the inevitable. 

When I opened them again, I was back in my bed. My breathing was heavy, and my head hurt. I groaned as I sat up. I raised my hand and rested it on my forehead, trying to nurse the pain. When I made contact with my skin, I found that I was covered in something sticky. I pulled my hand away and grabbed my phone, shining the torch onto my palm.

It was covered in blood.

I felt my forehead again and could feel a deep cut in the flesh. I winced in pain as I touched it, and realized that the wound was extremely fresh. I tried my best to clean the wound in the bathroom, and wrapped a bandage from my first aid kit around my head.

In the hallway outside my flat, the lights are controlled by a movement sensor. It’s pretty bad, and only stays on for a few seconds, even if you keep moving. As I walk back to my bedroom, I notice that the light is on outside. I walk up to the door, and double check the lock. The light goes off as I get nearer, but as I turn away from the door, I see it switch back on, the light glowing under the door. 

I move back into my bedroom, and open my laptop. That is where I am now, writing this, asking for help. I don’t know what to do, or how I can stop this. All I know is that whatever is following me, it’s getting closer, more confident.

Let's not gatekeep, so I've a SaaS idea and I want a co-founder to join hands. I'm happy to discuss the idea with you in details. 

My background: 
1. I've over 4 years of experience in ML/AI with a bachelor's and master's degree in CS and DS respectively. 
2. I'm currently based in Germany and planning to apply to YC, Antler and others with the idea and the MVP. 
3. Apart from the commercial part, I've started a social welfare platform where surplus food can turn into hope. It's inspired by Robin Hood Army. The link for it [MayabyCress](https://mayabycress.vercel.app). It's a basic MVP to see traction which will further be translated into a proper ""Zomato"" like app but for free food. 
4. Along with AI, I have some experience with product management as well as raising funds, conducting due deligence, market research and so on. 

I'm looking for someone who's stack agnostic and can share the same passion for technology and want to ride the AI wave but not just by creating yet another ""CHATGPT WRAPPER"" 

As we are starting from scratch, we'll be equal partners (50/50). 

If that resonates with you, even a bit then hit me up. I would be happy to schedule further 15 mins coffee chat sessions. 

If not then, just share it with someone who might be interested. ",1,1752651401.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

1m16a9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppDevelopers/comments/1m16a9d/an_idea_of_vocie_ai_feedback_widget_to_mobileweb/,An idea of vocie AI feedback widget to mobile/web. Does it make sense?,"Hi folks! I'm working on an AI voice feedback widget for web/Android/iOS and want your opinion before I get too carried away.  
  
**First assumption**: Developers/PMs actually value user feedback for complaints and feature ideas. (Hopefully not delusional here!)  
  
**The problem**: Collecting feedback effectively is a pain point for app developers:  
  
1. **Traditional feedback sets up barrier for end users.** Most widgets are just star ratings or comment boxes. As a user myself, typing in those boxes feels tedious. Even when people do type something, it's usually brief. Many users have great ideas/complaints but just don't want to type into a void. Imagine you're on a coffee break and see a feedback request - instead of spending 5 minutes typing out your complaint or feature wish (which most people just close), and send it without further respond, 10s and a few rounds of voice chatting with AI agent makes zero friction.  
  
2. **Existing feedback SaaS options have gaps**:  
   \- Most provide web portals for viewing feedback (Canny, UserVoice) and some offer web widgets (Zendesk AI agent, etc.), but very few have mobile widgets (Sprig, Doorbell). All are text-based.  
   \- Most target medium/large enterprises with high pricing ($50+/month average) - too expensive for small developers.  
   \- Focus is on analyzing existing feedback, not improving collection.  
  
3. **Small developers DIY or skip it entirely**. Most mobile apps I've checked use basic comment boxes, probably because developers don't have time/budget for better solutions.  
  
**Solution**:  
  
1. **Target small/medium development teams** across Android/iOS/web. Out of box widget.  
2. **Affordable pricing**: \~$5/month to cover amount of usage + scaling by token consumption.  
3. **Voice-first feedback collection** with AI chat agent to dig/extract specific complaints/ideas and lower participation barriers  
4. **Built-in FAQ system** that follows developer docs, plus AI that can help users write App Store reviews  
5. **Web dashboard** with basic search, basic AI summarization(tag, sentiment, importance, etc..), and export to PM tools (Slack, Zendesk, etc.). Make it simple and focus on front-end collecting.  
  
**Concerns**:  
1. **Is feedback actually important to developers/PMs?** Especially small teams - this is the foundation of my idea.  
2. **What's the most effective feedback format?** I'm focusing on user-initiated feedback, but what about surveys or tracking power users?  
3. Many SasS is focuing on analyzation of existed feedbacks. But my thinking is even today, AI is just a sidekick, the gold mine still need developer to dig out. So I will not devote too much in this part. Is this reasonalbe?   
  
Any criticism/comments/advice welcome! If feedback isn't important to you, or this product will not work, leave a comment it'll save me a bunch of time. Thanks!",1,1752650896.0,AppDevelopers,0,1.0,False

So I’ve decided to try something a bit crazy… I’m starting with just 4 bucks (about 40 SEK, I’m from Sweden) and I’m going to see how far I can go with penny stocks. The goal? 500k within a year – yeah I know, it’s insane. But I figured, if I lose it, I’ve lost less than a cup of coffee. If it pops, who knows.

📍My first move:
I bought into Puranium Energy Ltd (UX.CN) – a tiny uranium exploration company on the Canadian exchange. It’s super low cap and moves like crazy. I got in at 0.05 CAD.

Why this one?
Honestly, I’ve been watching uranium plays lately and figured this one is so small that any news, volume, or hype could move it big time. And I like that it’s not crowded yet.

🎯 Plan right now:

Hold short term

If it hits 0.075 CAD I’ll take some profits

If it dips below 0.035, I’ll cut it

No leverage, just learning and going for it


I’ll update as I go – win or lose. Might totally fail, but I’m documenting it for fun and maybe to learn something.

My parents are separated, they had me in their teens. My grandma is the only one who legit helped me growing up, I mean I had shoes taped up that were passed off because I was a skater ; but I’ve basically been homeless my whole life. 

My mom is bipolar , I had multiple really good jobs, paid off my car, got in shape, had a really solid start for myself. All worked for, eventually an ex gf set me up and ruined a job for me . My life has been in a downward spiral from there; but I picked myself up. 

After being falsely admitted to a psych ward by family I can’t trust them at all anymore. I have an opportunity to make a lot of money where I’m from and go up a corporate ladder. I mean big bucks, like $150k ; but it was never about money for me. Once again I was homeless and been put through so much crap. 

I wanted to join the marines if everything in life went to crap which it did; but now I have a firearm band and family did me dirty in the worst possible way. That experience was traumatizing; but I’m somehow recovering from it. I don’t smoke, drink, also cutting coffee. So yea, I’ve been gaslit, fear mongered, and emotionally manipulated. Im about to be 30 & my family did more things I won’t mention. 

I received a message asking if I wanted to eat for my bday because they just dismiss everything that happened like it was all a mental breakdown ; but they honestly did some shady s**t . I told them I don’t want to eat, just take the money we would eat with and put it towards my move out fund. 

They’re so offended I don’t want to stay here with them even with the offer of that 6 figure salary down the line; but that’s how toxic and crappy this environment is. I’d rather turn down 6 figures and struggle in the middle of nowhere than stay here make that & be forced to deal with these people who are my family any longer; but it’s mostly the environment.

I don’t know where to go from here.","I don’t know where to begin. It’s 2 a.m. and I cannot imagine my future or where I go from here. 

Monday I (25F) had a job interview. I had quit my other job at the end of May and my husband (27M) has been supporting us for the last seven weeks while I have been applying and interviewing with new places.

For context, I recently had a job interview at a different place where my tattoos were mentioned. 

Flash forward to Monday, and I was excited about this last round in-person interview I had scheduled that afternoon. My husband kept coming into the bathroom going back and forth on whether or not he could take me whilst I was getting ready and I said thats no big deal I just need the space to focus and mentally prepare and finish getting ready. When I was done in the bathroom, my husband complimented me, but then immediately started questioning my attire due to my arm tattoos being visible. I was confident in what I was wearing based on the ‘vibe’ of the place and I had already been screened via Zoom with my interviewers wearing the exact same thing. 

He continuously kept going in on how I shouldn’t wear a shorter sleeve blouse and wear a turtle neck and it was really overwhelming me and I kept saying please stop, I’m confident in what I am wearing and I’m really nervous and need to leave soon and want to focus on eating my lunch. He continued and things escalated. I regrettably lost my cool while he continued saying my earrings aged me and how the blouse was wrong and I smashed my bowl that had my rice in it into our coffee table, which is where I was eating, while shouting stfu. 

Immediate regret. My husband took a picture of the broken bowl on the table, before I could clean it which set me on edge, because I knew if I went to this job interview he would send it to his family and friends. I know what I did was wrong. I cleaned everything up and had to leave. Stupidly, I blocked his number because I was overwhelmed and didn’t even know if I could do the interview, but after speaking with my mom she told me to go. 

After the interview I spoke to my mom on the phone and she asked if I thought he was cheating, because of how quick the switch up was from being excited to criticizing what I was wearing. This also put me on edge, because last night I had had that thought when he had put his phone away quickly when I came into the room. 

A few years ago, when we had moved to a new city, there was an incident with a female coworker where my husband had taken a call and lied saying it was his dad. I knew it was a lie because where his dad lives it would have been 2 a.m. This unearthed a series of text exchanges they had made daily, which he had been proactively hiding and deleting from me as I had asked multiple times before this phone call to distance himself from this coworker since she was cheating on her fiance with a different coworker of their’s. 

This is what was running through my head, when I entered our apartment on Monday after my interview and after speaking to my mom, and I said to him I think you’re emotionally cheating again let me see your phone. He initially refused saying I could look at his laptop which for me I interpreted as a red flag. Eventually he conceded and he gave me the phone where I found text exchanges back and forth with a female coworker stemming from early March until that Sunday. These were surface level exchanges, but I felt hurt because he had sent her a pic of her favorite candy and sent pictures of him and his twin as kids (this coworker is also a twin) and my thinking was why is he feeling the need to do this with someone?

I mentioned the thread and he got defensive which I felt like was another red flag, given what had happened a few years prior, idk. He took my phone off of me when I was trying to leave so I went to our apartment buildings rooftop patio for space. I guess he tried answering my mom’s calls to me on my phone. He eventually met me upstairs and returned my phone. Obviously at this point we both were angry and frustrated at each other. 

Shortly after, I went back to our apartment and said I was staying in a hotel that night. He tried calling his mom, so she could speak with me which is something he had done when the phone call was lied about three years ago, but I just kept my headphones on and quietly told him I was sick of being disrespected and was going. 

Again, I know me slamming the bowl and immediately accusing him was wrong. I went to the hotel and fucked up more by keeping him blocked on everything except email. My mom had let me know once I got to the hotel that he was trying to contact her and was saying he didn’t know where I was. He also on the phone with my mom said twice I had thrown the bowl at him and then finally told the truth about me slamming it down on the table. 

I emailed him letting him know I was at a hotel and not to contact me or my family and friends unless it was an emergency. I had downloaded divorce forms offline and researched the process Monday evening. We have been together in total 7 years with having been married for 1 year. 

I felt certain in the moment this is what I wanted, so I sent them to him along with a doc listing what I wanted from the apartment. I want to make it clear I didn’t file anything in the system, I had downloaded forms that were examples of what we would have to file with the clerk. 

We ended up meeting in-person at 4 p.m. the next day to discuss filing. This led to a 4.5 hour conversation with a lot of tears from both sides. He explained to me that he told his entire family about everything (I had deleted my whatsapp account in the heat of the moment which had removed me from all of his family’s groupchats) and had told them I needed to go back to therapy (I just started therapy last week) and he also had said the same to his friends in addition to sharing the picture. He admitted he wished we hadn’t gotten family and friends involved because he didn’t know how we could come back from this with them knowing all of this. He suggested we could lie and say I was having a manic episode which I immediately shot down. (I don’t have Bipolar to be clear I have OCD, PTSD, and ADHD, but definitely not Bipolar or anything else.)

I told him I regretted acting on emotion throughout all of it. We are staying in our apartment tonight with me on the couch bed and him in our bed, and we discussed one of us possibly leaving for a week and deciding what we want to do at the end of the week or seeing how we feel in a few weeks. 

I am such a fuck up. I have ruined this because I let my frustration and bitterness take over me. We were supposed to go visit his side of the family and plan our wedding ceremony and reception (we only did the legal union last year with him and i and a friend as our witness) which we both agreed he will visit his family and I won’t be going. I shouldn’t have listened to my mom, she’s my only parent but I know she holds massive grudges with people, so I should have been weary of her influence. I should’ve just spoken to my husband’s mom or gone for a walk instead of spiraling and going to a hotel and downloading divorce forms. 

I know I am going to lose him and it is my own fault. I don’t know how we would repair this, even though I wish I could take the whole day back. I’ve been so overwhelmed by trying to find a new job, we recently moved apartments, I don’t have a relationship with my extended family and I have been caught in the middle of feuding between my mom and her mom and brothers, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I’m going to have no family at our wedding because my dad passed away when I was young, so its my mom, sister, and I, again no relationship/ tense relationship with my extended family. My birthday is on Monday and I just don’t know how I can face down another year earth side, when I have fucked up this much. 

I don’t know what advice I am seeking, but I don’t feel like I have a neutral adult or person to turn to right now. My husband is saying this will take time and we could heal from it but we also don’t know what that holds, but then I also can see that for him this could be the nail in the coffin. I know his whole family hates me and I know his friends all do as well.

I don’t know what to do from here.

1m165mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Comfortable-8809/comments/1m165mg/modern_vs_traditional_interiors_which_one_to/,Modern vs Traditional Interiors: Which one to choose?,"

Choosing the right interior style for your home is crucial because it’s about creating a space where you’ll live for years to come. Among the many options, two of the most loved and timeless interior design styles are modern and traditional. While each one has its own personality and charm, they both offer unique ways of bringing your home to life.

If you’re feeling unsure about which style to choose, don’t worry. This guide will walk you through the key differences, so you can make a choice that truly reflects your taste and lifestyle.

# What Is Modern Interior Design?

To begin with, modern interior design focuses on simplicity, functionality, and clean visuals. Originating in the early 20th century, it quickly gained popularity and continues to be a go-to style for those who appreciate neat, uncluttered spaces. Thanks to its minimalist approach, modern design creates a sense of calm and order that many homeowners find appealing today.

# Key elements of modern interiors

• Clean lines and simple geometric shapes that create a sleek, streamlined look  
• Neutral colour palettes with occasional bold accents to add visual interest  
• Open floor plans that allow natural light to fill the space and make rooms feel airy  
• Functional furniture that serves a purpose without unnecessary decoration  
• The use of natural materials like wood, glass, and steel to keep the design grounded and timeless

# Why modern interiors suits you best

If you love open spaces, clean design, and minimal clutter, then the modern style could be the perfect fit for your home. Moreover, it’s an excellent choice if you appreciate smart storage solutions, modern art pieces, and an overall calm, organized atmosphere that promotes peace of mind.

# What Is Traditional Interior Design?

Traditional interiors are all about warmth, comfort, and timeless beauty. Rooted in heritage, this style draws inspiration from classic Kerala homes and brings a rich, welcoming feel to any space.

# Key elements of traditional interiors

• Classic furniture pieces featuring elegant curves and intricate carved details  
• Warm colour palettes including deep reds, forest greens, browns, and touches of gold that create a cozy atmosphere  
• Rich fabrics like velvet, silk, and brocade that add texture and a sense of luxury  
• Thoughtfully layered décor elements such as rugs, curtains, lamps, and accessories that make the space feel full and inviting  
• Symmetrical layouts that bring a sense of balance, order, and timeless elegance to every room

# Why traditional interiors suits you best

If you enjoy cosy spaces that feel full of character, then traditional design might be exactly what you’re looking for. In particular, it’s a great fit for those who love [vintage décor](https://hgtv.co.uk/inspiration/what-is-vintage-interior-design/), appreciate storytelling through design, and want a home that feels familiar, grounded, and full of warmth.

# Can You Mix Both Interior Styles?

Yes, it works wonderfully. In fact, many homeowners now choose a transitional style, which blends elements of both modern and traditional design. For instance, you might pair a sleek, contemporary sofa with an antique coffee table, or install modern lighting above a beautifully carved wooden dining set. The key lies in balance, blending both styles in a way that feels cohesive, without letting one overpower the other.

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to interior design. While modern interiors offer calm, open spaces with a fresh and minimal look, traditional designs, on the other hand, bring warmth, elegance, and a deep sense of history. Ultimately, the best choice is the one that feels natural to you, matches your lifestyle, and creates a space where you truly feel at home.

I'm sad I couldn't get to this earlier - I'm sure it's too late to make reservations for some places. Not sure how busy things are in the summer.

This is our first family trip in a few years and dad passed last year so just wanting to make it a good one for everyone. It's also Mom's 73rd birthday.

Would appreciate any comments on itinerary below and any tips, restaurant recommendations (whether highly recommended or avoid), things to do (or *not worth* doing/seeing).

And yes I know the list is way too long - I'm a maximizer and could not help it lol. I just find places on the map and write them down.

**Details:**

So I’ve decided to try something a bit crazy… I’m starting with just 4 bucks (about 40 SEK, I’m from Sweden) and I’m going to see how far I can go with penny stocks. The goal? 500k within a year – yeah I know, it’s insane. But I figured, if I lose it, I’ve lost less than a cup of coffee. If it pops, who knows.

📍My first move:
I bought into Puranium Energy Ltd (UX.CN) – a tiny uranium exploration company on the Canadian exchange. It’s super low cap and moves like crazy. I got in at 0.05 CAD.

Why this one?
Honestly, I’ve been watching uranium plays lately and figured this one is so small that any news, volume, or hype could move it big time. And I like that it’s not crowded yet.

🎯 Plan right now:

Hold short term

If it hits 0.075 CAD I’ll take some profits

If it dips below 0.035, I’ll cut it

No leverage, just learning and going for it


I’ll update as I go – win or lose. Might totally fail, but I’m documenting it for fun and maybe to learn something.

Anyone else watching UX.CN? Would love to hear your take or if you’re doing something similar.

Start Small to Build Confidence,"If you’ve been trying to manifest for a long time without success, or if you constantly question the reality of manifestation, I sincerely recommend pausing your big goals for now. Instead, focus on some small manifestation experiments to build your confidence and understanding of the law of attraction.

Many manifestation coaches, like Sammy Ingram, Taylor Tookes, and Missy Renee, started with small manifestations, such as manifesting free coffee or spotting specific items (like a lemon-green car or butterflies). Personally, I tried manifesting a free makeup bag and noticed the same style of Dr. Martens that my SP often wears.

When you successfully manifest these small things, you’ll realize that our world is, to some extent, influenced by us. You can genuinely impact your reality. As you accumulate these small successes, you’ll truly understand that you are the operant power.

If you have doubts about the law of attraction, it’s best not to pursue goals that are filled with limiting beliefs. Otherwise, you might struggle to achieve that first crucial success. For most beginners, consistent small successes are what truly help you step into the role of a manifestor, rather than just feeling it without evidence.

I’d love to hear your thoughts! Have you tried small manifestation experiments? What did you manifest?

• “Get on apps.”
• “Just put yourself out there.”
• “Be confident.”

But none of this actually tells you HOW to start dating

Here’s why you feel stuck:

 1. Modern dating is confusing
We’re bombarded with advice that contradicts itself. Apps say “be authentic” but social media rewards good looks and materialism. Friends say “just be yourself” but you’re not even sure what that looks like on a date. And the younger generation nowadays view dating as either for hookups or attention seeking (atleast that's what the apps feel like) (lots of scammers on apps too)

 2. You’ve received bad dating advice
Most advice is generic:
• “Go to bars.”
• “Try speed dating.”
• “Just swipe more.”
These ignore the root issue: dating is a social skill, not a lottery. If your social confidence and conversation skills are low, no method will work.
 3. Lack of exposure
You think dating is separate from life. But it’s not. You only get better at dating by interacting with people daily in non-romantic contexts first. Otherwise, you’ll treat every conversation as a high-stakes event.

4. Thinking apps are the best way
Apps are easy but shallow. your ability to notice attraction signals, approach, flirt, connect, build tension, and lead is never actually trained, those are important skills to have while dating


 Secret Sauce Fix: (Something you prolly haven’t tried yet)
Start with “No Stakes Approaches.”
• For 5 days, talk to 5 strangers per day with no intention of flirting or asking out.
Example: “Hey, do you know a good coffee shop nearby?” or “That’s a cool bag, where did you get it?”
• The only goal is to build social fluidity.
• After 5 days, you’ll notice conversations flow easier. Then, start adding teases or playful comments. (but be very careful with this 😭)
Example: After they answer, “Nice, I’ll check it out. You’ve officially become my coffee guide for today.”

Why this works:
• Removes pressure. You’re not trying to date, you’re training your social calibration.
• Builds reference experiences & confidence. Your brain starts associating social interaction with fun, not anxiety.
• Makes real-life dating feel natural. You’re already in the flow.

 Remember: Dating doesn’t start with dates. It starts with becoming socially fluid so approaching or talking to someone attractive isn’t a mountain to climb – it’s just another moment in your day.

1m1636v,https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-vad,Found a pair of open-source tools for building Voice AI Agents,"Hey everyone,

Was going down a rabbit hole on GitHub and found something pretty cool I had to share. It's a pair of open-source projects from the same team (TEN-framework) that seem to tackle two of the biggest reasons why talking to AI still feels so clunky.

For those who don't know, TEN has a whole open-source framework for building voice agents, and it looks like they're now adding these killer components specifically to solve the 'human interaction' part of the problem.

The first is the **awkward silence**. You know, that half-second lag after you stop talking that just kills the flow. They built a tool called **TEN VAD** to solve this. It's a Voice Activity Detector that's incredibly fast and lightweight (the model is just 306KB). This also makes interruptions feel completely natural. It hears you the instant you open your mouth, so you can cut the AI off mid-thought, just like you would with a friend.

But then there's the second, even trickier problem: the AI interrupting you, or not knowing when it's actually your turn to talk. This is where their other project, **TEN Turn Detection**, comes in.

This isn't just about detecting sound; it's about understanding intent. It uses a language model to figure out if you've actually **finished** a thought (""Where can I find a good coffee shop?""), if you've **paused** but want to continue (""I have a question about... uh...""), or if you've told it to just **wait** (""Hold on a sec"").

This lets the AI be a much better listener, it can handle interruptions gracefully and knows when to wait for you to finish your sentence.

The best part? Both projects are well-documented, and seem built to work together. The VAD handles the ""when,"" and the Turn Detection handles the ""what now?""

It feels like a really smart, layered approach to making human-AI conversations feel less like a transaction and more like, well, a conversation.

Here are the links if you want to check them out:

I knew that I did not have ADHD and if I did it was probably a very minor form of it. But I wanted to take it because I heard that it was a performance enhancer. Well, it was for about maybe 3 months? But it very quickly led me down a slippery sloped. I would never abuse the medication but I would take it in combination with large amounts of caffeine nicotine and I would barely eat and isolate and that's just how it began. 

Fast forward to when I was 17 years old. Only one year later covid hit. This was in 2020 20. My doctor upped my dose to 15 mg instant release. This was twice a day but because of my addictive behavior I was taking it four times a day meaning that I was really taking 60 mg of Adderall a day and I was also combining coffee and other stuff with that at the time.

You'd think that because I was doing all this during covid that nobody would have noticed but they did. I was probably 100 lb at most and I'm 5 ft 10. I constantly looked cracked out and I was very jittery. 

Even during lockdown people noticed how cracked out I was. 

Fast forward to 2022. My mother died and while she was dying I was on Adderall The entire time. Albeit, at a much lower dose. However, I actually quit the Adderall almost instantly after she passed away. Probably within the first 60 Days or so. I was off of it for about 2 and 1/2 years. This is because after my mom died I went down to Florida. And the entire time that I was there. I still had my Klonopin prescription which actually helps me because I legitimately do have crippling anxiety and I actually take that as prescribed even though it is considered a highly addictive substance 

My father called me back in May. 


I'm now back at my dad's house and gave up my apartment in Florida. Even though I was happier in Florida, I'd rather spend this time with my dad 

I'm 23. Because of the trauma that happened to me when I was 20 with my mom passing away and me being addicted to drugs, I truly felt like I needed a couple of years to travel and cope and it helped me a lot. However, I realize that I could have spent those 2 years getting my associate's degree and spending all this time with my dad. 

It is July now. The local community college said that the deadline to register for September classes is already over. Meaning that I'm going to have to start in January. Meaning I will be 24 and only one semester into an associate's degree. 

My only other option is to take some classes online from the community college I was going to in Florida. However, I feel like that would be pointless because I don't plan on going back there for a long time. 

However, I don't plan on staying in new. You work for the rest of my life either. 

Please just pray for me. I don't know what to do and I don't know what path to take 

When I was in Florida I had a lot of friends. I was networking. I was living in a city. Life was exciting and everyone noticed a major improvement in me. I came back here to be with my dad because I understand that I didn't get to spend a lot of time with my mother and if I could rewind time I would have spent those years with my mother. However, I also feel as if I'm throwing away my youth by staying at my dad's.

Part of me realizes that because he lived a very unhealthy lifestyle and I'm talking incredibly unhealthy lifestyle that he might not have that much time left. So it would be best to spend my next few years here. But the other part of me also remembers that he has very good genetics but he also does not look very good and others have made that same comment.",1,1752650047.0,Christianity,0,0.6,False

On one side, San Antonio, a team that’s spent their offseason on a player-shopping spree so aggressive, it’s like they told their wallet, “Spend yourself into a coma.” On the other, Once Caldas, a squad that’s brought in Luis “Niche” Sánchez (a name that screams “star player” like a soap opera scream-queen) and Tomás Ortiz, who probably knows how to spell “consistency” in Morse code. Let’s break this down.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Lesson for the Slightly Interested**  
The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Once Caldas, giving them decimal odds of \~1.57 (or \~61% implied probability) at DraftKings and Bovada. San Antonio? They’re the underdog equivalent of a “mystery meat” entrée—5.75 odds (\~15% implied). The draw sits at 4.0 (\~25%), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Yeah, this could get weird.”

Why the disparity? Well, Once Caldas has the star power of Niche Sánchez, who’s allegedly a magician with a ball (though he’s yet to pull a rabbit out of a hat against Atlético Nacional, who beat them 3-1 to open the season). San Antonio, meanwhile, has the energy of a team that just learned their coffee machine is broken. They lost 0-2 to ABB in their last Bolivian league match—a result so underwhelming, it makes you wonder if the opposition was playing with an extra player.

**News Digest: Injuries, Altitude, and the Eternal Struggle of Shoelaces**  
San Antonio’s recent additions—Rodrigo López, Ariel Ávalos, and the rest of their “shopping spree”—haven’t magically transformed them into a title contender. Their loss to ABB was so惨, it’s rumored the referee checked his watch twice to confirm the final whistle.

Once Caldas, meanwhile, has Niche Sánchez, who’s either a rising star or a cautionary tale about Colombian midfielders w

1m162af,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m162af/aita_for_the_way_me_31_and_my_exs_33_relationship/,AITA for the way me (31) and my ex’s (33) relationship ended?,"I am a born female, queer person who identifies as nonbinary. Socially, I am both a ‘girly-pop’ and ‘one of the boys’. I grew up in a catholic household with my puerto rican mom & italian dad.

I’ve been openly gay for 5 years. In this time I hadn’t slept with anyone who was a man. I have sex/abuse trauma w men, and so i didn’t want to date one ever again. 

Enter Ex, we meet at a cafe. there’s energy between us, i like his style and that we have the same haircut (a slicked back bob). he has a great smile and he’s charismatic. everyone in the community loves him. we introduce ourselves and exchange instas. At the time I am in a long distance relationship & it is nearing its natural end. I am not “on the market” to date.

we chat over coffee, he commissions me to do some art for him. He asks if i’m single, so i politely tell him I’m a lesbian & in a relationship, but that I want to be friends. he then invites me to a DJ event put on by some lesbians a week later. We have an amazing time. the venue near the party has a live cumbia band. We are both latino so we’re like hell yeah should we dance a little bit?? 
Then I realize, ok we have incredible chemistry. He invites me over to his place, but I decline. i’m still dating someone. (morals!)

The following weeks my queer relationship disintegrates over the phone. It’s sad, but we were not compatible. I decide to be single for a while.

The man starts texting me & we begin hanging out. One day we kiss & i proceed to have sex with a man for the first time in 5 years. It’s intense but so fun, light.

we keep seeing each other. I tell him that I need time to process my breakup, but that we can still date. I can tell he is inexperienced as he doesn’t have a lot of language around relationships and has no idea about queer culture at all besides a binary understanding of trans people. He thinks therapy isn’t effective, he is kind of immature. we have different backgrounds, he grew up in a trad latino household which i understand (lots of people in my family like that). i gave him a lot of grace when it came to topics like this. He was willing to listen & learn and often thanked me for educating him.

Then his family member passed away tragically. I organized a fundraiser for the funeral (I do this often it's not a huge burden on me to do). his family is like are you official? i’m like i don’t know. he’s like i don’t know. we continue getting closer.

Enter a guy friend i’ve had for 8 years. let’s call him GF. He’s my one guy friend. We slept w each other 8 years ago casually, we were also seeing other people. We decided to be friends but remained open w each other about our sex lives. GF is very active in his sex life. I am a chronic relationship type person. I enjoy GF’s weird & funny stories—he helps sex workers make content, he falls in and out of love, he asks me for advice. We are both sex positive so it’s not unusual for him to be open about the details. at one point he sends me a pic of his dick in an old lady’s mouth. I’m like that’s gnarly, it made me laugh. Every few years or so he pitches hooking up, only when Im single. Everytime he pitches i say something like “lol maybe someday, but im good”.

Around this time I am feeling super into my ex. I’m falling in love with him, which i had been in denial of, part of that was fear of being with a man again. GF is saying he’s so good at head now and if i’m down he could show me. i respond with “if the stars align im down but right now im dedicated to this guy, im in love w him”. I have no intention of following up on that, we don’t even live in the same state, in my mind I’m a lesbian, my Ex is the only exception. GF is super happy for me, boundaries are made, we dial back the sexual openness out of respect for ex. 

Now the gasoline is pouring. Me and ex begin full on dating and it’s amazing. I am so in love with him. He’s cool, he’s funny, I enjoy our differences. 4 months later, i’m casually talking about GF and his gnarly stories, unaware it will trigger ex. He absolutely freaks out that I am friends with someone I once slept with. He says that shit is sus and wrong, f that. I’m like we are just friends who are sex positive, that’s it. He’s like it’s NOT fine. I am bothered there is not this level of concern for my lesbian friends who i have slept with. I feel that is rooted misogyny. We have a bad fight. He comes back w flowers and apologizes. We talk more about the nature of that relationship and he need not be threatened.

Then, June. I am severely ill—horrible cramping, nausea, bloating, loss of appetite. I go to the doctor for weeks to try to figure this out. There’s no info, i think it’s my appendix. It’s not. I take a test. I’m 6 weeks pregnant.

At this point I’m getting a better pov on my ex. I learn he is more trad than he let on. he’s paranoid about other men. He thinks women should be pure & makes comments about women who have active sex lives being bad or immoral. He makes comments about the queer community that aren’t accurate. just misguided, hateful fox news incel talking points. He calls himself a “nice guy” saying ‘nice guys finish last’ whenever he is frustrated. He is convinced my friends hate him—but there hasnt been enough time around them for him to have that conclusion. I realize he has a big ego. He constantly needs validation & is suspicious about everything. He expects me to share his posts as a sign of love, but never shares my artwork. he has no control over his emotions. That said, 98% of the day to day of our relationship is positive. We have beautiful moments laughing together, going on trips. giggling and lovemaking, being kids, reading together, cooking together. Our hearts are open, we are planning for the future.

early on he told me that he believes in a woman’s right to choose, citing Tupac. So I I tell him, I love you but I cant take this baby to term right now. I’m in excruciating pain & i feel like something with the pregnancy is off. our communication wasn’t in a place where we could healthily navigate parenthood, i’m concerned about $ bc i live month to month, & he is financially supporting his own child with his ex. He ‘supports’ my decision, but does literally the opposite of that. he kisses & cries into my stomach. he tells me that pregnancy pain is normal & it’s fine. he tells me “he is pregnant too” & could feel my pregnancy, even though he is able bodied & not experiencing pain. there’s a lot of concerns i have about values & communication, about his distrust of me & others, his need to always be the center of things. everything in my body is telling me no.

I proceed with the abortion. I keep him informed of every step. He says he needs to get a limpia (a spiritual cleanse) that he needs to beg god for forgiveness. hes picking fights over small things. we have some really good conversations and beautiful moments in between. I feel like i’m dating two people and they are at war.

He has to go out of town for work but wants to cancel for the abortion. I urge him to go, bc i didn’t want the labor of processing his emotions, I wanted to focus on caring for myself. I’m feeling guilt, inconceivable grief, excruciating pain, and dysphoria about the way my body is changing. It’s fkin horrible.

He comes back a day after i start the process. I have lost a concerning amount of blood & i am so weak. I sleep all day. He storms out after he said i’ve been “ignoring him” and “not giving him any affection”. I am baffled. he comes back, apologizes. I recognize that this is hard on him too.

The next morning, he wants to go on a day trip to the river, which would require an hour in the car and hiking in the hot sun. I physically can’t. I can barely stand. He gets upset, saying I “left him alone” he goes and kayaks at the lake and has an awesome time. I’m trapped in my body, trapped in my bed, sobbing, feeling everything, struggling to eat. he comes back & seems like he feels better so I’m happy he went. I guess?

The next day he is mad after overhearing my roommate saying she loves gossip? i told him well, i love gossip too lol. He gets out of bed coldly, gets dressed, and says “I don’t think i could be with a chismosa”. he then goes through my phone. he scrolls back far and sees Taylor’s dick in the old lady’s mouth. He sees the text of my turning down head. He screams in my face. He calls me a disgusting wh0re, he hopes i die, he hopes i starve to death. He’s maniacally laughing. I try to leave the house, distressed, and realize he has slashed all 4 of my tires.

He tells everyone I cheated on him. The anguish i experienced after that was unbearable. My immune system popping off, my heart rate doesn’t calm for an entire week, I am unable to eat, still bleeding, having a generally fkin horrible time.

I keep reeling thinking back on the situation. What did I do wrong? Were we doomed from the start? I’m trying to rationalize his behavior, i’m coming up with nothing. Im trying to process the loss of life, the pain of the procedure, the betrayal of violating my privacy and going through my phone, the violence, the character assassination…I am struggling to get perspective. things were not ideal but i’m having a hard time figuring out wtf happened.

Am I the asshole???",1,1752650029.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1m162a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sociallyawkward/comments/1m162a7/feeling_lost_on_where_to_start_dating_heres_why/,Feeling Lost on Where to Start Dating? Here's Why (and The Real First Step),"You prolly heard or thought one of the following:
• “Get on apps.”
• “Just put yourself out there.”
• “Be confident.”

But none of this actually tells you HOW to start dating

Here’s why you feel stuck:

 1. Modern dating is confusing
We’re bombarded with advice that contradicts itself. Apps say “be authentic” but social media rewards good looks and materialism. Friends say “just be yourself” but you’re not even sure what that looks like on a date. And the younger generation nowadays view dating as either for hookups or attention seeking (atleast that's what the apps feel like) (lots of scammers on apps too)

 2. You’ve received bad dating advice
Most advice is generic:
• “Go to bars.”
• “Try speed dating.”
• “Just swipe more.”
These ignore the root issue: dating is a social skill, not a lottery. If your social confidence and conversation skills are low, no method will work.
 3. Lack of exposure
You think dating is separate from life. But it’s not. You only get better at dating by interacting with people daily in non-romantic contexts first. Otherwise, you’ll treat every conversation as a high-stakes event.

4. Thinking apps are the best way
Apps are easy but shallow. your ability to notice attraction signals, approach, flirt, connect, build tension, and lead is never actually trained, those are important skills to have while dating


 Secret Sauce Fix: (Something you prolly haven’t tried yet)
Start with “No Stakes Approaches.”
• For 5 days, talk to 5 strangers per day with no intention of flirting or asking out.
Example: “Hey, do you know a good coffee shop nearby?” or “That’s a cool bag, where did you get it?”
• The only goal is to build social fluidity.
• After 5 days, you’ll notice conversations flow easier. Then, start adding teases or playful comments. (but be very careful with this 😭)
Example: After they answer, “Nice, I’ll check it out. You’ve officially become my coffee guide for today.”

Why this works:
• Removes pressure. You’re not trying to date, you’re training your social calibration.
• Builds reference experiences & confidence. Your brain starts associating social interaction with fun, not anxiety.
• Makes real-life dating feel natural. You’re already in the flow.

 Remember: Dating doesn’t start with dates. It starts with becoming socially fluid so approaching or talking to someone attractive isn’t a mountain to climb – it’s just another moment in your day.

Ever wondered if, instead of time being a straight line like we're told, it's more like a chaotic maze? What if our memories are actually vivid, living parts of that maze, just floating around in a jumble, engaging with us whenever they please? I mean, imagine remembering something from your childhood and wondering why it feels like it only happened five minutes ago. 

Lately, I've been caught in that kind of time loop—where certain smells, sounds, or glimpses of light just drag you into memories you didn't even know were itching to resurface. It's like how the smell of freshly brewed coffee can teleport you to a tiny café where you laughed too hard over a bad joke with... someone whose face is now a bit blurry. Or how the sound of a whistle can bring back the flood of an old P.E. class, even tho your entire sports experience was sitting quietly avoiding the dodgeball. 

I'm not saying I've perused alternate timelines or anything, but maybe our dreams are time travelers themselves, guiding us through this maze of moments. It's kinda comforting if you think about it—a reminder that every memory has its own odd little home in our lives, nestled among the classic ""What ifs"" and ""Almosts"" that make up our past. 

So, do memories live in a world of their own? I'm sorta here for it if that's the case. It's like having friends who just appear when you need a reminder that your story's still being written, in some beautifully bizarre, non-linear way.

1m160og,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m160og/the_next_frame/,The next frame,"Recently, for my 19th birthday, my mother bought me a used camera she found while antiquing. I’d talked in passing about my desire to start up photography — the idea of taking photos at odd angles, or blurry shots with too much glare, always sounded more appealing than the overly produced nature of social media pictures, where everyone has filtered faces and perfectly adjusted angles, with meticulous posing. I enjoy the chaos of amateur photography. 

However, while it was an entertaining idea, I never considered actively pursuing it as a hobby. Still, I thanked her for the gift and promised to start my amateur work. 

It was a nice camera — a silver brick that probably felt sleek in the hands of some ancient 2000s man, with small scratches that dimmed the shiny veneer it once had. No doubt, this camera was loved before ending up in my hands. On the side, it read 'Kodak Silver' in aged black letters, and the front had a lens that protruded from the device, which made it feel advanced for something so vintage. 

Quickly, I started looking for things in my house to capture: me, my bed, my cat, a flowerpot on my counter. I even managed to get a cute one of a ladybug that sat on my finger. I must’ve only taken about twenty photos before the camera said storage full. I mean, I knew it was an old camera, but I thought it would have more memory than that. 

I plugged it into my computer to offload what I had, opening the folder, only to realize there were hundreds of photos left on the device from a previous owner. 

For a second, I thought about just deleting them. Something about peering into another person’s life felt strange, like a breach of privacy. For a moment, I felt like a true artist, spitting out words of wisdom. 

That lasted about ten seconds before I started scrolling through the images. 

It took longer than it should have before I realized I’d scrolled through twenty photos and most of them were just black, with a few bits of light here and there, like when you accidentally take a photo with your phone in your lap. I started to zone out when, finally, the thirtieth–odd photo showed something intriguing. 

Legs. A pair of denim jeans in an intentional crotch shot. Well, it was more interesting than the black photos. 

Not much in the way of inspiring art, so I started scrolling faster. It looked like a guy in his mid–twenties, who didn’t have much skill with a camera — no face, no people, just odd shots of his room, his closet, inside his car. Nothing all that exciting, not until around the seventy–seventh photo. 

This one seemed to be a pillow on his bed, cut to pieces, its cotton innards spread all over the bed. That was followed by photos seventy-eight and seventy-nine, which captured the walls of his closet, entirely scratched up by something. Some scratches looked deep into the wall, like something you could only do with a knife. At this point, I wouldn’t say I was shocked, but I felt an unease hit my stomach. Was this guy using the camera to document something going on around him? Could it be… supernatural? 

I was more than intrigued. I was captivated at this point. I knew I had to find out more about this story, but it was already late, so I got ready for bed. 

That night, every turn of my pillow, every glance at my closet stirred up my imagination. Can’t say I got much sleep, but I just lay there in bed till the light outside started creeping through my window. 

Got up, made some coffee, and opened my computer, ready to learn more about this paranormal activity. It was a little too quiet in the house that morning, so I turned the TV on to drown out the silence and started reviewing what else was in the file. 

It didn’t take long for the images to start getting creepy again. Photo eighty-nine was of a hallway taken at night, followed by a couple more flash photos — out the window, in the closet again… but it was the ones under the bed that felt eerie. What did he suppose he would find down there? 

Photo ninety-three was the first shot of his face — a charming man, mid–twenties, with short hair. I would say he was cute if it weren’t for the angle of the shot. 

The camera was framed from above, his whole body in frame, and it looked as if he was sleeping. Whoever this cameraman was, they were taking flash photos of him while he slept. 

I was so locked in, I didn’t realize the eerie music was coming from the suspenseful CSI slop playing on the TV. I took a breather and switched the channel to something lighter. The sound of a laugh track usually annoys me like nothing else, but I found some comfort in the levity. 

The tension in the room felt thick. I opened my window in hopes it would find its way out and let in some actual air. 

What is this shit? I thought. Maybe a weird art project. The words slipped out from Stupid Town.   
 “Maybe I should stop here,” I said out loud, as if hearing words of wisdom from someone smarter than me. 

I sat at the computer, hovering my mouse over the files, ready to delete them. 

But I couldn’t. What if this were evidence of a real crime? If it was… did I want to continue? 

I decided to stop there for the day. I went out to lunch with my mother, and she asked me how I was enjoying the camera. 

I didn’t tell her about the photos. I felt almost guilty hiding them, but I didn’t want my mother to feel like this was her fault for buying me the camera in the first place. 

And I wasn’t sure yet what any of it was, but I knew I’d find out tonight once I got home. 

It was around six when I got home that night. I sat down in the safest chair in my apartment — a comfy chair I keep in the corner, overlooking my small room. I felt like an animal cornering itself, but it did make me feel a little less paranoid. So long as no scary demon ghosts jump down from above me, I should see everything else coming. Well, now that I said that, I keep looking up. 

I loosened up with what used to be a full glass of wine and continued to scroll. 

The next dozen shots seemed repetitive at times — two shots in the kitchen, three shots in the corner of the room facing nothing at all. It made my corner defense feel ominous. I took one more look up at the ceiling before continuing. 

A shot of the bathroom, and then of the toilet, and then deeper into the bowl. This was all so creepy. I didn’t understand the motivation. Five photos of clothing hung up in the closet, but these photos were weird — a hand can be seen moving the clothes out of the way, taking a picture of each one. The hand was feminine and bony, the veins popped through her pale white skin, her nails were filthy, and her long-sleeved shirt looked ragged and unsanitary. 

The next few shots alternated day and night — sometimes of the man checking every crevice of his house, only seeming to find dirty prints on the floor and spots on the door. One photo that made me pour another glass of wine was of some half–eaten food under his bed. 

When the photos were not obviously from the man, things went back to weird. 

A picture of a toothbrush. A picture of the woman holding his boxers up to the camera. A picture of his new pillow. And then the same pillow, now dirty and smudged. 

The only plausible deniability was the thought of how a person could keep coming home to this and stay there. The proof was entirely in the camera. Did he never check this footage? Maybe he, too, thought it was supernatural at some point — but this was obviously not. A thought crossed my mind as my lips slipped the very words out. “Maybe he never had the chance.” 

By the time I realized I was on photo 161, everything began to get so much worse. 

It was the man again, in what appeared to be a new house, as nothing looked the same. 

But it seems whoever his stalker was had followed him to his new home. 

What was now clearly documented evidence on his part was slowly spiraling out of control. 

Photo 187 onward — a toilet seat entirely slathered in dirt and grime. Photo 195 onward depicts cereal and crumbs behind a couch in the living room. Photo 211 onward showed clothing all over his room, pulled from dressers and closets and laundry hampers, covered in more grime. Photos 225 onward are when I realized I needed another drink. 

Every surface… of every counter… of every wall had been emaciated by more grime and filth. 

My jaw dropped so low it hurt. I mean — how much grime can one woman produce? 

Plates and furniture were toppled over and smashed against the ground, and bloody footprints walked back and forth through his house. The thought alone left me almost comatose. 

But nothing I’d seen, no amount of wine, could have prepared me for the last hundred–plus slides. 

It all starts with photo 261. Judging by the fact that these first few are of the man, tells me it’s probably his stalker that now has the camera. These angles are insane — slits in doors as the young man changes, more of when he’s asleep, followed by more black photos. It’s clear in these that the man is extremely unwell — his eyes are sunken and a deep red, he looks much more malnourished than he did in earlier shots, and looks more unkempt with each day. 

The part I truly began to question the absurdity of these photos is when this deranged camerawoman seems to be clearly in his line of vision, sometimes during the day. It truly looks as though he passes right by her in some of these, as he exits the bathroom or when he’s waking up. Is she that good at hiding? 

There are over fifty more photos taken from beneath the bed. It clearly lasts until sunrise, when we see the man leave his house for the day. 

The last fifteen… it seems to start similarly to the rest. The man is asleep in bed as the camera stands at his doorway. It gets closer — fourteen, thirteen, twelve. She’s clearly standing over him. Now she’s on the bed. Now she’s on top of him, straddling his waist. Eleven, ten, nine. The flashes of the camera clearly upset the man’s sleep. Her hand envelopes his whole face. Eight, seven, six, five. Her fingers slowly push into his mouth and down his throat as the wine begins to make its way up mine. I hold my hand to my mouth and take a second to collect myself. 

Four — he’s clearly awake, forcing his eyes shut. Who could sleep through someone gagging you? 

Three — his eyes are jetted open in a blurry photo, as I assume he tried to get up as quickly as possible. I can see it clear as day — the fear in his eyes staring at whatever horror stared back at him. It’s all too real, all too unbelievable. 

Two — the next shot is a flash but captures nothing but a blanket, maybe a hand in the blurry corner. 

One — a smile. Just yellowed teeth and cracked lips are all I see in frame. The flash shines brightly at the horror of a pleased grin. The sight had me looking away more than her gagging him. 

It was over. It was finally over. I closed my laptop and unplugged the weaponized camera from my computer with a quick pull. I went over to the center of my room and, with tearing eyes and helpless yelps, I smashed the camera into the hardwood floors as pieces cracked and lenses shattered. I didn’t stop until half the camera disintegrated across my floor, and I realized my hand had begun to bleed. I cried, there on the floor, for maybe an hour as I slowly numbed to the pain in my hand and the scars in my mind. 

A day ago, my mom asked me how I was liking the new camera. I told her I dropped it, and it broke. Couldn’t salvage any of it. She did offer to buy me a new one, but I told her I’m not particularly interested in photography anymore. 

Today, I opened my computer to see that I still had one file saved on my laptop. It was the first photo, the one entirely black. For a second, in the dark, I could almost make out a toothy smile in the image. I even thought about brightening it up to finally see who our culprit was, maybe turn it into the police. 

I deleted it instead. 

I think I’ve finally realized some things should be left alone. Forgotten.

1m15z3e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m15z3e,REPOST with updates: roomie doesn’t want to pay utilities when they’re on vacation and wants to split the cost based on usage,"UPDATE: 

1. BIL was still too enraged to sit down and have an adult in-person conversation. My SO and I ended up having a chat with sister on his behalf instead. 
2. Within one night BIL and sister came to Jesus and realized splitting the electricity based off usage was impractical. She agreed that for future events they would still be responsible for paying their share of the utilities even if they were gone for more than 12 hours a day. HOWEVER, she is uncertain if BIL will agree with having to pay utilities during their frequent vacations. 
3. We concluded that all of this miscommunication and resentment was partly due to the fact that they would constantly misinterpret our words. For instance when I said we are open to sharing our spices they both took it to mean let’s share all household goods which is why they didn’t think to bring their own stash. For this issue we decided we clearly will document everything moving forward. 
4. We will not share consumable household goods with a few exceptions: dishwasher detergent, dish soap etc. we will clearly document this agreement in case of faulty memory. 
5. They were still insistent I Venmo the $2.30 for a “clean break.” We compromised and just split the jar in half.  
6.Sister also admited she was wrong to compare me to sister B because they were never roommates so the comparison doesn’t work. 
7.At the end of the day sister kept insisting the miscommunication came to be because I was blunt and hurt BILs feelings for saying no to sharing certain household goods. Example I said no to sharing Lysol wipes because I knew they would use 100% of it within the week whereas my SO and I would have the same containers for years since we only use them for rare lazy clean up days. This added with every odd look I made his way erupted to 6 months of resentment he felt righteous with his petty responses 
8.when I questioned BILs inability to deal with emotions and petty reaction as a possible need for therapy she insisted he was triggered by my bluntless and that I should reflect on doing better instead.
Maybe she is right and I will reflect on that. But it is red flags to me that she is still thinking of having a child with this type of person. 
9.and of course I had to know why BIL felt compelled to respond with “lol” and he admittedly was doing it to be petty and knew it contributed zero to the conversation.

TLDR: roomies want to split utilities based off usage per person. They also don’t want to pay for utilities during the times they’re on vacation.

For context these roommates are my sister and brother-in-law. My SO and I have been sharing a house with them along with 1 other roommate for a total of 5 people in the house. We had been splitting utilities 5 ways each month which is what agreed to when they moved in. We also agreed to share certain consumable household goods in half unless specified otherwise for the past 6 months. Surprisingly, when they first moved in they did not bring any consumable household goods with them. When I asked what happened to their current supply they said they were just gonna leave it at their Airbnb to expense it out. So basically they were assuming they could just use our current supply without contributing any of their own. I was annoyed but thought it wasn’t worth bringing up since it was family, whatever.

We are now 6 months in and even though we share these household goods it is always my SO and I who purchases, replenishes and stores the household goods. I have told them  they are welcome to do the same but they agreed but never followed through.

So as of a few days ago I suggested that perhaps we should not share consumable household goods anymore. It would be fairer to everyone and if someone is out of coffee filter than it was on them to replenish it.

That’s when I got this text message that’s attached.

Am I just delusional or is the suggestion of splitting the cost of electricity based on usage per person impractical? The picture they attached is also based just off of the previous months cost and in my area prices fluctuate heavily based on the time and season. They also both WFH whereas my SO and I don’t.

My sister said it is a burden for them to not share consumable household goods. And that at the end of the day the cost evens out. But is it now becoming a burden for them because they never had to think about it before because they never had to handle it?

My sister also asked why I can’t be generous like sister B because she never charges her utilities or cost of food. Which is strange because they were never roommates. If anything my sister would house sit, baby sit, or puppy sit for sister B as a favor. If anything sister B should be paying her.

Looking for genuine advice because I honestly didn’t think asking to not share consumable housegoods would lead to this situation 😔",2,1752649689.0,badroommates,5,1.0,False

Their hearts belonged to the same woman: Janet Jameson, the butler's daughter.Even their dying words were the same: Don't marry me.So in this life, I would not waste my time on anyone who does not truly want me.""If I must marry for the sake of the family, I choose Samuel Lockwood,"" I told my parents.""Samuel? Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.\*\*\*Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""""Because...""Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.She did not want someone who did not want her.So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""Brent and Cassandra were stunned.""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.""Which hospital?""There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""Chapter 2After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.""Leave the coffee and get out.""Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.Chapter 3After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""""How much did you hear just now?""""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""Chapter 4After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... """"There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.So, no, she could never compete with Janet.Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.And Emma would never be their wife again.Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.""What's this?""Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?""",1,1752649687.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1m15y4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m15y4k/i_can_get_over_my_ex_its_been_2_years/,I can get over my ex. Its been 2 years.,"Hey Reddit, 

This is my first time posting. Im an avid reader on here for laughs and community but i've never posted. Ive been tempted to ask for advice for a while now and maybe just tell someone that isnt the four corners of my mind. Lets see where this goes i guess. 

Ava and I started as friends through mutual friends back in 2016. She was dating my best friend, Mara, at the time. Nothing sinister—just a solid friendship, the kind you have with your best friend's girlfriend. Eventually, the group expanded, and we’d do typical high school things like trip on shrooms and smoke weed together. Things took a turn when Mara and Ava broke up. One night, while tripping on shrooms, Ava confessed she had feelings for me. I was in a relationship at the time, so I didn’t know how to process it. Plus, the whole “dating a best friend’s ex” thing felt like crossing a boundary. Nothing happened, and we stayed friends.

Fast forward to a rough breakup of my own. Ava stayed by my side during that whole mess. She was there when I was at my lowest—sitting with me through late nights and bad decisions. But, for reasons I still don’t fully understand, I went back to my ex. I lost touch with Ava, Tim, and my other close friends during that time.

A few years later, I reached out to Ava to apologize for disappearing. She forgave me, and we reconnected on her birthday. That night, something inside me clicked, and I realized I’d been in love with her all along. But at the time, Ava was dating someone else. We fell into this pattern of reconnecting more and more, but my feelings for her grew despite her being with someone else. Eventually, they broke up, and after a night out, we ended up kissing. The desire to kiss her had been building for so long—months of emotions and tension all coming to a head in that moment. I didn’t realize what had happened until after our lips parted, and it was as though all the uncertainty and longing I’d carried for so long had finally been resolved in that instant. What began as this amazing and confusing connection evolved into a ""situationship.""

Things were complicated. I didn’t have the courage to commit, and my addiction to alcohol became a coping mechanism. I went out nearly every night, sometimes five times a week. At first, it was just part of growing up, but it quickly spiraled into something I couldn’t control. I was using alcohol to mask my insecurities, and before I knew it, I was drinking at work just to get through the day. Ava saw this, and she was patient with me, even trying to help me find therapy. But I wasn’t ready to face my issues. Eventually, we made things official, but, of course, after all the heartbreak that comes with situationships.

Eventually, I took a step away and worked at a ranch far from my old life to try and get a grip on my addiction. Ava was supportive but obviously hurt by the situation. And at the time, I wasn’t ready to face the reality of getting better. The ranch was just another cover in the name of sobriety—something I realize now.

About three weeks into my stay, I broke it off with Ava. I felt guilty for dragging her into my mess of a life. I felt I was holding her back, and if I truly loved her, the best thing to do was to let her go. It destroyed me. My addiction got worse, and I went back to the city. I went from job to job, losing them because of my addiction.

We would often see each other at holiday friend get-togethers, and each time ended with me getting too drunk and crying about her. It ruined any chance of a friendship, and we saw each other less and less. Eventually, I met someone else—let’s call her Catrina. I met her at work, and after months of trying to get over Ava, I felt like I was finally making progress. My friendship with Catrina turned into a relationship that was new and refreshing. It felt innocent and like a fresh start.

Months into dating, I reconnected with Ava on a friendship basis, meeting for coffee and talking about life—a grave choice I often ruminate on. One day, during one of our coffee chats, she confessed that she still had feelings for me. I was livid and relieved at the same time. How could she, after months of watching me grieve, tell me this right when I was moving on and seeing someone else? A part of me felt relief because, deep down, I was still in love with her.

I'm not proud of the fact that I continued my relationship with Catrina later, knowing I still had unresolved feelings for Ava.

One fateful night, I ended up hanging out with Ava. I was already drunk, and I kissed her. Nothing happened, but I was so embarrassed. Ava told Catrina, and my infidelity siphoned the innocence from the relationship with Catrina. It took months of work to rebuild any kind of trust between Catrina and me, but it never felt the same. Catrina and I became toxic, as loyalty, trust, and honesty were destroyed from the start. She ended up cheating on me twice. Well deserved, I know. I ended it, as the pieces were just too broken between us to put back together. I took the opportunity to actually get better. I started seeing a therapist and got a grip on my addiction. I’m 5 months sober and working out consistently. I’ve been unpacking the mistakes and horrendous choices I’ve made that landed me here. I’m trying to become someone I’m proud of, and it’s paying off. I make time for my friends to do things other than get wasted. I play board games, and I can sleep just a bit easier knowing I’m not adding another laundry list of wicked choices that hurt others. I cook weekly for my family. Things are looking better for me, and I’m making sober choices I can stand by.

Ava is dating someone now and has been for a while, but even after a year of not seeing each other, I can’t stop thinking about her. I don’t necessarily want to be with her, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m still in love with her—or maybe it’s something else, something deeper that just won’t fade.

Six months ago, she called to thank me for helping her with schoolwork after she graduated. Then, a few days ago, Rhea and Tim organized a game night. Ava asked to join with her girlfriend—we’re all in the same friend group. I was already at Rhea’s house when she asked if it was okay, and I froze. All the work I had done to convince myself I didn’t have feelings for Ava came down like a house of cards. I told Rhea I’d feel more comfortable if it was just us this time. Ruby understood and rescheduled Ava’s visit.

I’m left in this in-between—a place where I love someone who is no longer mine, but not in a way that seems to fade. I can’t tell if it’s love or something else—something more painful, maybe—but it’s there, lingering, even after all this time.

How do you let go of someone who, despite everything, is still a part of you? I want to move on, but every step forward feels like a step toward something unfinished. I’m looking for peace, but it feels like I’m caught in a loop that never ends.

Any and all advice is welcome.

Am I unreasonable for thinking it's an overreaction?,"Basically me and my Fiancée have moved in together recently and we are doing quite well. Pretty much all parts of the relationship are very stable and happy except for one: I am extremely bad at organising things and tidying up. I know it's bad, it's really not intentional, when a t shirt is on the floor in the bedroom or things like that I don't even really notice it in my mind. I tried to make more of an effort to fix this because I know it can obviously bother anyone. 



However, my Fiancée gets quite upset at this. Last night I came from the Gym late and was extremely tired and wanted to sleep because I have to wake up at 6 am to go to work, and she  came in the bedroom extremely angry at the fact I hadn't put my folded t shirts from the coffee table in the drawer yet, and they'd been sitting for a day or so. She refused to sleep in the same bed as me because I hadn't done so. I told her I think it's a bit of an overreaction and I asked ""Would this kind of thing make you wanna not live with me/be with me anymore"" and she basically answered yes. Generally whenever something is untidy or isn't put back in place she gets really angry and asks in a demanding/angry tone ""What is this?""

  
I understand being disorganised is really bad, but I'm really not doing it on purpose. And I think I could just be told in a more positive tone to do these things and I'd happily do them to be honest. However she argues that me not knowing or noticing the disorder when I know it bothers her is disrispectful to her and ignorant.

Any advice on what I could do in this situation? I am trying to be more organised but it's extremely difficult. How could I explain to her that it's really difficult for me to suddenly become organised after a life of being like this? Also considering her reactions, if I don't manage to get better at this do you think my relationship is doomed?

Then a scan showed I’ve been sick this whole time.,"For years, I woke up feeling foggy, drained, and disconnected. I couldn’t think clearly, I forgot words mid sentence, and I couldn’t keep up with people. I told myself I was just lazy or burned out. Maybe it was depression. Maybe I just wasn’t trying hard enough.

So I kept pushing. I made lists, drank more coffee, kept showing up, and quietly fell apart inside.

Last month I got a CT scan. It showed severe chronic sinus inflammation. Apparently it has been pressing on my brain, possibly for years. The doctor said it could explain the fatigue, memory issues, and cognitive dysfunction, and suddenly everything clicked.

I sat in the parking lot and cried. I felt relief, because it wasn’t all in my head. I also felt grief, thinking about how long I had been blaming myself for something that was never my fault.

Tomorrow I have a short call with my doctor to try to get medical leave. I’m scared they won’t take me seriously. I’m scared I’ll sound “fine” and be told to keep pushing through it. I don’t know how much longer I can do that.

If you’ve been through something like this, when everything was invisible and no one understood, I’d really love to hear how you kept going. Or just that you’re out there too. I think I need that right now. 💗",1,1752649403.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

I got out of the hospital and ended home, she came foward about everything 2 days ago after a family meal, since I there wasnt anything serious om that chat I told her everything and se got extrimly upset about everithing, at one point telling me that she doesnt wanna hear about me at all.

That was until a couple hours ago when she called me asking how i was about my trip to the hospital and also to try and remedy the situation, she apologized about the things she said but she told me the only way we could be all right was if I blocked my friend and never talked to her again, I refuse on the spot but se went ballistic again, saying that I didnt respected her, that I would rather keep a friendship over her, that i wasnt loyal to her and that i was acting childish. I mamaged to keep thing calm and she just wanted to hear me say that i would do the things that she asked me, i agree and she hung up justo saying goodbye. 

I really dont know if i am really acting childish or if it is just something she is saying because im refusing to cut ties with a 7 year friendship, i would apreciate any avise since if i go to my friends they might be biased about their opinion about everyting, in any way i will update on any development

Need advice as something smells fishy","We didn't text much before meeting but we connected on out first date, it was simple coffee date followed by an hour long walk with conversations we both enjoyed.

We have met 2 twice after that and talking to him feels natural, we talk about movies, social issues, our ambitious, work, childhood, past relationships etc. We text most days and play chess virtually too. We are far away from being intimate, thats something I will go to only when I am atleast slightly sure about him

He mentioned he was in AM process 4 Years back and is right now looking to find a life partner. We both are looking for long term relationships.

Being single for a while i have been on a lot of dates and emotional maturity matters most to me as I had some traumatic events in the past and he is one of the rare people who I feel can understand things

Little about him and me: He studied B Tech and MBA from tier 1 colleges, he seems successful, writes articles to news channels and has huge followers on Twitter. His mom dad are decently successful too, I feel.

I am a fashion designer, I work on my hobbies and moat of day is spent in work, read, and fitness I like to live a peaceful life.

Something I feel is fishy: He mentioned he was in a live in relationship for a year with his MBA friend they dated for 2 years and broke up in July' 24. Since then she started seeing someone else and lives with the guy but they still split the rent for the apartment as he hasn't moved out. He said he is looking to move out with his friends but at the same time mentioned him, his ex and another MBA friend are thinking of looking for a 3BHK. He mentioned a strong bond with his MBA group of friends and that breaking up shouldn't affect the group or friendship.

I have been single for 2 years now and was in a 4 year relationship of which the final 1 year we lived together

I wouldn't be ok with the guy I am seeing living with his ex. I really like being with him and not sure how to seek clarity, I suspect a open relationship too. Or worst case is he just looking to have a good time without any pressure or commitment ?",5,1752649111.0,RelationshipIndia,6,1.0,False

And then it happened—a fleeting, shared glance with a stranger across the room. It lasted just a second, but there was this instant understanding, like we both knew we were seeking some comfort, some connection in the same space.

That look felt nuanced, like a soft reminder that even in loneliness there’s this strange, shared human experience.

1m15puv,https://i.redd.it/uflc4qp596df1.jpeg,The only house that ever actually frightened me.,"This is the Croke-Patterson Mansion in Denver, within walking distance of my home. The urban myths about it have been legendary for decades. Guard dogs frightened so badly that they leapt to their deaths from the upper turret window; a still-born baby buried in the basement; neighbors and passersby reporting lights gliding through rooms when no one's there; numerous paranormal investigations with unexplainable figures in mirrors, clear EVPs, you name it. I could go on but you can Google the house name. You'll find no shortage of links about it. Are any of the stories true? Who knows. It's finally been restored and turned into a B&B. They do ghost tours to capitalize on the stories. Who wouldn't? Here's the B&B's photo gallery for more pics.

  
[https://www.pattersoninn.com/gallery.html](https://www.pattersoninn.com/gallery.html)



I operate in a state of non-belief about ghosts, meaning I neither believe but I also don't disbelieve. I love ghost stories and haunted house movies. I've stayed in multiples of the most haunted rooms in the supposedly ""most haunted hotels."" (dun-dunt-DUNH!) Never got anything but a good night's rest.



I've done haunted house tours in San Diego, Savannah, Charleston, Key West, Portland, Seattle, and New Orleans. In NOLA I was actually invited to join a paranormal investigation of a house in the Garden District. The investigators all got super cool hi-tech equipment. I got stiffed with a fricking copper dowsing rod (grumble-grumble). Most of the investigators' ""proofs"" could easily be dismissed but I didn't say anything.



I do these things because I think they're great fun, even though most of the stories behind them are easily disproved by some quick Googling. ""The doctor who lived here went mad, killed his daughters, threw his wife from the roof and then committed suicide!"" I think that one's from Savannah. Um, no, the doctor and his wife lived to be 91 and 92,  their daughters all grew up, got married, and had families of their own. I keep my mouth shut on those tours, though. Why be \*THAT GUY\* who spoils everyone's fun?



When I was in my late teens and newly enrolled in Uni, friends and I hit Broadway, just down the hill from the Croke-Patterson. Had dinner, hit the clubs (thank you fake IDs!), did after-hours, finished the night at a coffee house nearing 3:00 in the morning. Decided to walk back to my place, which was a condo overlooking Cheesman Park. And oh boy, here we go off on a different ghostly tangent!



Cheesman has its own notoriety for having once been the City Cemetery except that they left most of the bodies in place when they turned it into a park. Cue shades of Poltergeist (""You left the bodies but you only moved the headstones!!""). It's estimated over 2,000 people are still buried beneath the park, and every couple of years crews working on a sewer line or whatever dig up another grave. Tons of ghost stories about that place. Again, you can Google if interested. Some are sad, some really scary.



Interestingly, my place was in a condo high-rise built directly on the site of the Henry-Treat-Rogers house that inspired the 1980 movie ""The Changeling."" My all-time most favorite haunted house movie ever! If you haven't seen it, or if you have and would just like to watch it again, it's free in its entirety on Youtube.



[""The Changeling""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC_B_e0Enqw) 1980 movie starring George C. Scott.



Here's the [condo building in question](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.736122,-104.9666366,3a,75y,2.29h,106.71t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sVAkFlP1P2rfGuPt9EBf5Kw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-16.713521010592856%26panoid%3DVAkFlP1P2rfGuPt9EBf5Kw%26yaw%3D2.291422153163751!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcxMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Spin around to see Cheesman Park.



So back to the Croke-Patterson Mansion (""FINALLY, A-HOLE!"" yells much of subreddit Ghosts). We headed up 11th Avenue toward home and found ourselves outside the Croke-Patterson Mansion. Through the years it had been, variously, a private home, a boarding house, a seedy apartment building, a hippie squatter's house and drug den, offices, and god only knows what else. But at this time it was empty and abandoned. Woo-hoo, let's take a look! We were more afraid of one of the neighbors calling the cops on us than we were about seeing any ghosts.

  
We crept around, peering into windows, trying them all and the doors to see if we could get in. Doing the usual teenager crap of jump-scaring each other. ""BOO! You were scared, admit it, ya pussy."" Blah-blah. But it didn't take long until the mood changed.

  
At one window, the second to the right of the arched door in that pic above, I peered in and I could swear a shadow raced across the room toward me. I dismissed it as probably just my own shadow through the window. Nevertheless, I felt pure evil. I don't know how else to describe it. I physically jerked back in fear. It felt like there was something on the other side of the glass staring right back into my eyes. Something that wished I'd come in so it could tear me to pieces then drag my soul to Hell. I don't believe in demons but my blood ran cold. It was one of the most genuinely terrifying things I've ever felt. I almost began hyperventilating.

  
In the courtyard, someone's girlfriend began crying. Just minutes before, she'd been all-in on the fun. Suddenly wailing, ""I wanna go now! Let's go!"", her boyfriend had to take her across the street because she'd begun sobbing and trembling uncontrollably. A few other guys agreed, ""Not that we're scared or anything but yeah, fuck this place."" And they high-tailed it outta there. I joined them across the street and we all apologized to the young lady. ""Just having fun, didn't mean to scare you,"" etc., etc. She pointed behind her to the house, her back turned because she couldn't even look at it, and cried, ""It's not you guys, it's that place!""

  
For the following weeks, I'd be startled awake around 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM for these things??), certain that I'd heard footsteps tromping down the hall toward my bedroom. Hearing shuffling about my room, I'd sit up and hold my breath, listening keenly and peering into the darkness. It felt like something was there. Eventually those friends and I compared stories. We'd all been experiencing it. Could it have been all of our over-active imaginations? Probably. But it was always near 3 AM for each of us, and always the exact same experience. I'm not saying something followed each of us home but I also wouldn't say it didn't.



Eventually it died down and ceased. But I still get the creeps whenever I go by the Croke-Patterson Mansion. If you made it through all of that rambling, congrats, hope you liked it. Now let's hear about any places that have creeped you out, and did things happen to you after you visited?

## What is Platzi AI Hiprex?

Platzi AI Hiprex is an **AI-powered trading platform** that automates trades across multiple markets like crypto, forex, and stocks. Think of it like a trading assistant that never sleeps, constantly scanning the market for opportunities and executing trades on your behalf.

What caught my eye is how the platform emphasizes **ease of use**, especially for beginners. You don’t need to be a financial genius or know how to read candlestick charts. It’s all about automation, data-driven decisions, and letting the AI do the heavy lifting.

It’s kind of like having a robo-trader in your pocket—minus the attitude.

## Who Created Platzi AI Hiprex?

The creators of Platzi AI Hiprex are a bit of a mystery, which is pretty standard for platforms in the AI trading space. While there’s no single “face” or founder tied to the brand publicly, it’s reportedly developed by a **team of fintech experts and algorithm developers** with experience in AI and trading software.

That said, the lack of transparency might raise a few eyebrows. But it’s not necessarily a red flag—many legitimate trading tools don’t disclose their dev teams, especially when operating internationally. Still, I’d love to see more openness in the future.

1m15nhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1m15nhc/unintentional_weight_loss_and_fatigue/,Unintentional weight loss and fatigue,"Cross-post for WomensHealth.

I (woman in my late 20s) have lost weight unintentionally over the past two and a half years. My energy levels have also dropped, and it's starting to affect my entire wellbeing.

I moved to a new city in late 2022, started grad school and got a new job. My life was very busy and intense. I started eating substantially less and was more physically active than I've ever been. My weight was 50 kg in December 2022, height is 5′1′′.

Someday in June 2023, I'd just returned home from work and was undressing to take a shower when I saw myself in the mirror and noticed how my collarbones, ribcage bones and pelvic bones were all sticking out. This was really frightening as I'd never seen myself like that before.

I saw a doctor a few days later. She told me I needed to eat more and to eat healthier. She gave me ideas of what to eat for a 'balanced' diet. At that point, I've been having one (small) meal a day with snacks and coffee throughout. The meal was either an actual meal, a salad or a Subway sandwich. It depended on the day.

I did exactly like she said, started cooking healthier balanced meals and increased my food intake significantly more than before. I genuinely thought I was doing OK, even though my weight hadn't been visibly increasing. But the next time I'd weighed myself was in December 2023, and I was 42 kg. The doctor ordered me to get a blood test, a urine test, an X-ray and a heart ECG. The tests didn't show any problems, which was very confusing.

Since I was a teenager untill that point, I'd been diagnosed with several mental health conditions and had been taking psychiatric medications that could cause a decrease in appetite. But I'm sure this is not an appetite problem. I also discussed this with the doctor.

I continued on the same diet for the following few month till May 2024 with no big improvement. In May 2024, I decided to just start eating high-fat foods. Almost everything I ate was deep fried. I ate lots of sweets and pastries. By July 2024, my weight had increased to 45 kg. But this didn't help with my low energy levels. I was constantly feeling exhausted, and was becoming less and less productive.

I went back to eating on the previous diet. Now (1 year later), my weight is 43 kg. I still look very unhealthy. I feel tired almost all the time and it's really difficult for me to stay focused and productive.

I'm starting to worry this might follow me for longer than it should.

*October 10, 2024*

So I (27M) met Mila (25F) like 4 years ago at a bar. Long story short, it was a mutual friend’s birthday, we were at this bar, and we had both just gotten out of long-term relationships. Hers was 5 years, mine was 4. A LOT of drinking later, it was hella awkward waking up naked on the birthday dude's couch with Mila. But honestly, that wasn’t even the wildest thing that happened that night. The birthday guy? He did something WAY worse.

Anyway, after all that, me and Mila were both super awkward about it. She legit looked like she wanted to crawl under a rock. Neither of us wanted anything serious since we had just broken up with our exes, but we still swapped numbers and went our separate ways.

Fast forward like 3 months, Mila texted me up asking to grab coffee. I thought it was kinda weird, but I figured she might wanna go on a date or something. When I got there, she looked like she’d been crying. As soon as I sat down, she just started bawling. Turns out, she was pregnant. She hadn’t realized cause she was super stressed and tired, but I was the only person she’d slept with. My whole life flipped upside down. We did a DNA test, and it was mine. Then she moved in with me cause she was sharing a room with a roommate. The guest room became hers, and my office is now Andreas room, but we call him Andy.

Having a kid wasn’t exactly in my plans, but since Andy came along, my life’s been better, honestly. Over the years, me and Mila never really had a romantic relationship, except for this one time she kissed me after Andy was born. We get along, I support them, I’m paying for Mila’s grad school (she finishes next year), we split the chores, and I’m always there for whatever she needs.

So, in November, Andy’s gonna turn 3. We’ve been planning his birthday, it's around Halloween, so he and his friends are all gonna dress up. He wants to go as Bingo from Bluey. During one of our talks, Mila asked if I wanted her to move out. She said now that Andy’s 3, we could co-parent separately, and I could even, like, get a girlfriend if I wanted to. I just went blank and said “no” and dipped to my room.

Here’s the thing: I love her. Having Andy is everything to me, but I’m also legit in love with her. She’s smart, beautiful, caring, thoughtful, kind, dedicated, she’s literally the most perfect person ever. But I’m way too scared to tell her. We have a kid together, and I’m terrified of ruining everything between us as parents and friends. I don’t know if I should tell her how I feel or just keep pretending everything’s fine so I don’t mess up what we have.

*October 12, 2024, 2 days later*

So, I (27M) posted my story a few days ago, and yesterday I finally talked to Mila (25F).

Quick recap: me and Mila had a baby together after a one-night thing. Ever since, we’ve been living together and I’m in love with her. She’s absolutely stunning, breathtaking even, but I’ve been too scared to tell her how I feel because I didn’t want to mess up our co-parenting situation.

So, I left work early, picked up Andy from nursery, and dropped him off at my mom’s. I bought some flowers, cleaned up the house while she was in class, and texted her, saying she didn’t need to pick up Andy and to just come home because we needed to talk.

When she got home, she looked at me with her big eyes wide open, and the first thing she asked about was our kid. I hugged her for a while, but she went full mommy bear mode and kept asking about our baby boy. After I reassured her that he was with my mom and totally fine, she finally calmed down. I brought her to the living room, gave her the bouquet, and started talking.

It was a long convo. I told her how I’ve been scared of ruining things and how it hurt when she asked if I wanted her to leave. She admitted she was afraid she was messing up my life, that she feels like a burden sometimes, and even blames herself for ""ruining"" my life with the pregnancy. I shut that down real quick. I never wanted kids, but honestly, since Andy and Mila came into my life, everything’s been way better. It’s been the best, most challenging “mistake” I’ve ever made.

She also said she likes me too, and she’s felt that way since she was pregnant but wasn’t sure if it was just the hormones. After the baby, she felt embarrassed to say anything because she didn’t feel comfortable in her body anymore. She never got back to her pre-pregnancy body and thought I wouldn’t find her attractive. But to me, she’s the most beautiful and hot woman on the planet. She also admitted she’d get jealous when I went on dates, even though she knew it didn’t make sense because we weren’t ""a thing."" Honestly, if she went on dates, I’d be dying of jealousy too.

We talked for a long time, even got into some deeper, more personal stuff.

By the time we were done, it was late. We went to this small restaurant near our place for dinner. No wine 'cause I was driving, but it was amazing. We chatted about music, movies, and she went off about ASOIAF for ages while I rambled on about LOTR. We talked about life and random stuff. At the end of the night, I got a few kisses in the car, like we didn’t even live together, which was kinda cute.

Then we watched a horror movie(awful movie btw), but she fell asleep cuddling me. It was a day full of wins.

*December 20, 2024, 2 1/2 months later*

Hey guys!

So, I saw a TikTok video about my story and it’s kinda embarrassing having a piece of my life narrated by AI haha. I decided to give y’all an update, but first, a quick note: please use protection. I read some concerning comments about my situation. Yeah, I was pretty drunk and reckless, and things could’ve turned out way worse. Don’t be like me.

Alright, here’s what’s been going on these past few months: We broke up, and she moved to another city :( … Just kidding, haha.

Andy’s birthday was amazing! Everyone showed up in costumes, and the kids loved it. Andy dressed as Bingo, I went as Bandit, and Mila was Chilli. Andy was over the moon that we all dressed up, but what melted my heart was when we were getting ready in the bedroom, and my little guy said, “I always wanted this.” I think the way our dynamic was before, we didn’t really have these sweet family moments, and it makes me so happy that my son gets to experience this now.

So yeah, we’re officially dating now, and it’s been nothing short of amazing. She’s happy, my little guy is happy, and nothing makes me happier than seeing them like this. Has it been perfect? Nah, it’s the start of a relationship with a lot of baggage. We’re doing couples therapy because we’ve been living together and acting as a family way longer than we’ve been an actual couple. The first month was kinda rough. I felt awkward about being intimate at home, and so did she, mostly because of the family dynamic we had before. But I think we’re building something really good.

I don’t have much else to update for now, but I’ll definitely share if anything new happens.

I told her about this account, so to the hottest woman alive: you’ve got my heart. Love you, Emilia, my Mila.

*July 7, 2025, 9 months later*

A while ago I posted here about how I was in love with my baby‘s mom And I was strongly encouraged to talk to her, and I did.

We’ve been together for 8 months now, and these have been the best 8 months of my life. Everything is worth it as long as I’m with her. Every day during these 8 months, I go to bed knowing that everything I experience with her is worth living.

Now, for the biggest update: I proposed to her, and she said yes. And unlike the first time, we’re already planning to give our Andy a little brother or sister right after the wedding.

Thank you, Reddit. I think this will be my last update.

Ps: The dog, Oswald, is fine!

Edit: 
I other platforms, I saw some really disturbing comments. Some people are really worried about the fact that I pay for stuff for my now fiancée. Just wanna say, I’m not struggling financially, and even if she didn’t want to be with me, I’d still cover everything for her until she had a solid career and a place of her own.

My main concern is my son. If I can give him and his mom a better life, why wouldn’t I? I think, that as a dad, it’s my job to make sure my kid has the same opportunities, and I’ll keep doing that, no matter if I’m with his mom or not.

Whether you're invited to an Arab home or dining at a traditional restaurant like Arabian Tea House, understanding the [dining etiquette in Arabs ](https://arabianteahouse.me/dining-etiquette-in-arabs/)is key to showing cultural appreciation and enjoying a meaningful experience. This cultural guide walks you through the essentials.

# 1. Hospitality Comes First

Arab culture values generosity above all. Guests are treated with the utmost respect and are often offered coffee (qahwa) and dates as a traditional welcome. Refusing refreshments may be considered impolite, so even a small sip or bite is a courteous gesture.

# 2. Always Use Your Right Hand

One of the most important etiquette rules is to eat, serve, and accept food with your **right hand**. The left hand is traditionally seen as unclean, especially when eating directly from shared dishes.

# 3. Sharing Is Tradition

Meals are commonly served **family-style**, with large platters placed at the center of the table for everyone to share. Take only what you can eat, and avoid wasting food—respect for the meal is deeply rooted in Arab culture.

# 4. Wait for the Host

If dining in someone’s home, always wait for the **host to signal the start** of the meal. It's also polite to let elders begin eating first. If you're unsure, simply observe and follow the host’s lead.

# 5. Dress Modestly and Respectfully

When invited to a traditional meal or visiting cultural dining spots, modest dress is appreciated. Avoid sleeveless or overly revealing clothes, particularly for women, as a sign of respect.

# 6. Avoid Offense During Religious Occasions

During **Ramadan**, don’t eat, drink, or smoke in public during the day. Many Arab restaurants like **Arabian Tea House** provide discreet dining areas for non-fasting guests.

# Final Thoughts from Arabian Tea House

Respecting **dining etiquette in Arabs** isn’t about strict rules—it’s about honoring tradition, showing gratitude, and embracing a different way of life. At **Arabian Tea House**, every dish is served with care, and every guest is welcomed as part of the family. By understanding these customs, you’ll turn a simple meal into a culturally rich experience.",1,1752648226.0,u_khaled12pop,0,1.0,False
1m15kxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m15kxu/anxiety_worsening_sleep_disturbances/,Anxiety worsening; sleep disturbances,"Hey everyone. 32yo male here.

I'll try my best to tl;dr this, but I'm a chronic over-sharer, and I can not help but feel the need to be detailed in lieu of succinctness. I'm sorry.

I've been struggling with a shit salad of mental illness all my life, but for the last 16 months, it's been dialed up to 10. And, over the past few months, my sleep quality has been diminishing further and further, and I'm losing my mind. It could be a number of things: depression, untreated ADHD, GAD, health anxiety, my weight (300s), hypothyroidism, and still feeling withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing venlafaxine after 3.5 years. I'm also an alcoholic, but I have been sober for officially one year and was sober between April 2020 and May 2024.

I used to teach ESL in China. I lived there for 5 years. I wanted to stay forever. It was an amazing experience that allowed me to explore my wanderlust while not being overly restricted by these primordial mental blocks that make everything seem overwhelming. However, it is also where I was hospitalized for alcohol withdrawals. This almost began in February 2020, when covid was coviding.

I had it all: trouble breathing, low red blood cell count, severe insomnia, delirium tremors, loss of appetite, fatigue, and shivers. I'd always been prone to anxiety, but here is where I experienced my first full-blown PA. I genuinely thought I was having a HA. It was the MOST terrifying experience I've ever had, and little did I know those 30 minutes of pure terror would fundamentally change me.

I relapsed again 2 months later and was hospitalized again, but instead of overwhelming physical symptoms, I had a psychotic break. I was seeing faces and figures on the walls and ceilings, and at one point, I thought I was having a Skype call through a ceiling tile while laying on the hospital bed. I was also hearing voices as clear as day, and we were conversing like friends until they convinced me that they were trying to k*ll me. It was insidious. My panic was triggered again; I was inconsolable. I was yanking out my IVs, trying to escape the hospital because the voices were telling me their plans, telling me they were going to cut my penis off, etc. I was eventually discharged into a psych ward, where I spent 2 weeks becoming friends with the local mentally afflicted Chinese. After 2 weeks at the Chinese psych ward, I was discharged. I went home. When the initial 2.5-month shutdown was lifted, I resumed work until the end of the year. I felt okay. A bit disheveled, but okay. 

Suddenly, one night, almost poetically at the start of 2021, while playing League of Legends, I was overtaken by a strong sense of doom. Before I could even process what my mind was saying, I began putting on whatever clothes I could find, telling myself to get out of my apartment and get to a hospital. It took a few hours before that feeling went away, but this episode left me totally disarmed and afraid. I thought I had healed. And then, a few weeks later, while asleep, it happened again. And then a couple days later, it happened again: impending doom followed by increased heart rate, trouble swallowing, and chest tightness. Sometimes, the symptoms preceded me catastrophizing a bit of shoulder pain, and other times, it required 0 trigger. It got so bad that I couldn't wear seat belts without feeling anxious. I tried to tough it out by practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques, but I couldn't. Breathing exercises felt straining, likely a skill issue, and they reminded me of those hours that I spent short of breath before the hospital admitted me for alcohol withdrawal. 

I went to a general physician in March 2021 for a comprehensive physical because I was still having issues with fatigue and weight gain, where we noted that my liver levels were normal, but my thyroid hormones were totally out of wack. I started a dose of 100mg levothyroxine, later 150mg. Eventually, I did notice minor improvement in energy.

I sought psychiatric intervention in September 2021, as I began having continuous panic episodes suddenly and sporadically. Funny enough, I felt grounded while I was at work, likely because my brain was occupied by students and lesson planning. I explained to the doctor that I was also struggling with executive dysfunction (getting to work late; struggling hard with routines; can not regularly do chores, over reliance on the sense of urgency to accomplish tasks, but even that was waning) and losing interest in things I loved over the past several years, and detailing my ever-devolving psyche; I had a panic attack during the initial appointment. I was prescribed 75mg venlafaxine, 2mg klonopin, and 0.4mg xanax. The xanax did very little, but the klonopin felt like a lifesaver. I'd almost forgotten what it was like to not be in a perpetual state of terror. It completely arrested any and all panic symptoms systemically. I also experienced 0 side effects from the klonopin, except a little misplaced groggyness if I took one too late at night. Eventually I arrived at 150mg venlafaxine with almost no positive effects but a ton of side effects: heat intolerance, sweating, increased heart rate (which did not help with my health anxiety), destroyed my libido, and nausea. None of these ever subsided. By the time I experienced missing my first dose and being SLAPPED with brain zaps and dizziness, I was fully onboarded and too afraid to discontinue it. I thought I just had to give it more time, and maybe some speck of joy and excitement would return.

I started this new regiment on top of the levothyroxine and went about my life. The doctor said venlafaxine would help with executive dysfunction, but it didn't. It made me even more lethargic, and it made starting and completing tasks even harder because not only did it give me yawning spells, but it also made me sleepier. Mornings, which were already tough, were pure agony. I was almost in tears every morning, but I didn't attribute this to venlafaxine. My anxiety was finally under control, and I was no longer having panic episodes in the middle of the night, so I thought, ""Hey, I'll take what I can get."" I even stopped the klonopin to see if it was causing this new level of sluggishness, but even without it, I could sleep for 10 hours and feel like I only got 2 hours.

From September 2021 to April 2024, the anhedonia, fatigue, and executive dysfunction became worse and worse. I turned to coffee as a supplement, which I seldom drank even during my undergrad unless I was prepping for an exam/project or an important upcoming event, because it made me jittery, more anxious, and caused trouble with sleep, but it helped me focus and gave me energy. Eventually, though, caffeine wasn't enough. I was never a nap person, and eventually, I needed midday naps.

It sounds like hyperbole when I say doing anything and everything felt hard, but that was the reality for me. I would spend days thinking about the trash that needed to be taken out or the dishes, now sprouting mold or sometimes flies, that needed to be washed, or picking up important packages filled with classroom materials and feeling paralyzed. No matter how much sleep I got, waking up felt painful. I was so irritable and groggy. I had to sit for a few moments and ground myself every morning before I could even stand up. Coffee had diminishing returns, and it eventually started making me sleepy. But my anxiety was still under control. I'd even go days without taking a klonopin without succumbing to the chest tightness or trouble swallowing.

The executive dysfunction got so bad that I was arriving to work late several times a week. I was also falling behind on lesson planning. No matter what I did, I just couldn't set a proper schedule. I lost my job suddenly 1 week before the end of April 2024. I was crushed. I lost a good job that came with a 3-bedroom apartment. I knew it was coming, but I thought hey, I love my students and my students love me, I work hard during class, and once I'm at school, I can teach for hours, so the administration will surely acknowledge this. Nah. Not even my handsome cat, whom I rescued 7 months prior at my old apartment complex (he was found wandering for weeks and somehow made it to the 9th floor of my complex) was enough to motivate me. I was in full self-sabotage mode. I started drinking heavily again in May 2024. I was in such disarray that I was procrastinating job applications and interviews because, again, everything felt difficult. 

On July 14th, 2024, I woke up with severe pain right above my belly button. I was diagnosed with alcohol-induced pancreatitis. I spent 16 days in the ICU. I couldn't secure a new job in time, so I lost my work visa and was consequently repatriated back to the States. I lost 5 years of my life, my belongings, my beautiful cat, all because I didn't have the drive or willpower to plan and take action accordingly anymore. 

On August 12th, I left China and moved to Washington State to live with a friend from community college. I was so depressed and distraught. I thought about ending it several times. I lost my dream job. I stopped taking klonopin and began tapering off venlafaxine. Things felt okay at first, but my friend made it perfectly clear that she was not there to support me emotionally during my mental health crisis , as I thought. I was sleeping all day, I was isolating, I had no motivation whatsoever, and I was still emotionally recovering from the move, the pancreatitis, and the intense guilt of abandoning my cat. I faced intense criticism from her and her daughter for all my shortcomings. I was going weeks without showering, and even though I tried explaining the paralyzing feeling in my soul, they continued to criticize me, even though I was trying so hard to do chores and push myself even when I couldn't. I was berated and treated like a farm animal. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. My anxiety rebounded hard, and now I was waking up in the mornings with aggressive anxiety. This is where my sleep troubles evolved. 

By now, it's November 2024. It's been 2 weeks since my last dose of venlafaxine and over 3 months since my last dose of klonopin, and I have not had a panic episode. One day, while watching TV with my friend and her family, something just didn't feel right. I wasn't able to concentrate, and I felt uneasy. I go to bed later that night, struggling with racing thoughts and restlessness; the trouble swallowing, chest tightness, clammy extremities, and terror came back in full force. I message my friend's daughter (who is 5 years older than me) and ask for some company. I started hyperventilating,  and the panic didn't cease for over 2 hours. I thought I was going to pass out. 

The next day, we go to the ER, where I am given a small dose of venlafaxine and Ativan, which did absolutely nothing. I finally summed up the willpower to apply for Washington Apple care after putting it off for months due to fear and getting an appointment with an NP. We reinstated 150mg of venlafaxine and 2mg of klonopin. However, my anxiety had reached its apex, somehow worse than what it was years ago, and 1 kpin isn't enough. I took 2 and found some relief. Within a few days, my symptoms had settled. However, now my friend and her daughter are accusing me of being a drug abuser, despite having told them that I have never ever taken Klonopin for recreation and that I never increased my dose since beginning in 2021. In fact, if I didn't need it, I wouldn't take it.

 I felt helpless. Klonopin helped bring me back to a stable mindset. I still had the good, motivating anxiety, not the one that blankets my every thought in doom. I even found a remote job teaching online. Things were finally taking a turn for the better. But then, they weren't. I started struggling with social and work burnout or something. That crushing feeling, that fuc*ing heinous mental block that made everything feel overwhelming, was coming back and worse than ever. I stopped teaching. I started withdrawing socially again. I was waking up every morning super afraid and overwhelmed. I began obsessing over the household chores because I didn't want my friend berating me for doing them wrong or late again. I was waking up every single morning in fight or flight, afraid of my friends' comments, but also overwhelmed by the chores that I was forcing myself with every fiber of my being to complete. 

I'm so sorry. This turned out to be much longer than I anticipated. 

I left Washington in early February of this year and moved back in with my parents in California. My mental health has further declined. Since moving back, I've effectively been bedridden. I don't leave my bedroom. I don't speak with my parents. I can't. I don't have any energy. They don't ask about me either. I had to stop my venlafaxine cold turkey due to losing insurance. This destroyed me. I still have withdrawals 5 months later, but that first month? I wanted to die. I haven't emotionally or physically recovered. I don't know what to do, what the answer is, or who to turn to.

If you made it this far, thank you so so much. I know this is a long, difficult read filled with fluff and non sequiturs. I'm sorry. I feel the need to elaborate excessively. I don't know where that comes from.

TL;DR: Over the past 5 months, since discontinuing Effexor, and especially for the past 3 days, my sleep has suffered tremendously. I'm waking up several times a night, eyes heavy but mind in panic mode, and anxiety ALL day, ESPECIALLY in the morning. No more on or off. It's on ALL fucking day. I get several panic attacks a week now. I still have trouble with words. My memory is completely shot. My appetite is all over the place. My dreams have all been extremely vivid since stopping the venlafaxine, which's further contributed to what feels like rapid cognitive decline. I went February to April without my thyroid meds until I was finally approved for insurance, but my lethargy, complete absence of motivation, and sleepy problems have not improved. I'm getting worse and worse, with no end in sight. Everything feels insurmountable. I haven't had phone service in over a month now because I can't even afford 20 dollars, but I don't have the capacity to teach again, even though I was teaching remotely several months ago. I don't have any motivation. Is this depression? Is this ADHD? Is this a result of emotional and professional burnout? Is this because of my hypothyroidism? Is it because of health anxiety that's consumed me? I have been bedridden for 5 months now, and I can't even stand up for more than 5 minutes without back pain. The thought that I could have a HA eats away at me because of my inactivity. I google my symptoms.

Im in shambles. I have gotten like 3 hours of sleep every night for the past 3 days, and it's only worsening my already rock-bottom psyche. 

I've been seeing a therapist, but I haven't gotten answers; we've just been practicing grounding techniques. I've tried onboarding new antidepressants, such as Lexapro and vortioxetine, but the anxiety becomes too heavy. The prescriber doesn't want to give me klonopin. He also thinks it might be sleep apnea, but these symptoms got even worse and haven't recovered since my antidepressant withdrawal this February. It feels like torture. 

I don't know what to do. Thank you again for reading. Any and all advice are welcome. ",1,1752648192.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Recently I decided to detox and reduce it gradually. I tried increasing water, reducing coffee quantity and dividing a strong cup into weaker cups. But even then, I’m sleeping most of the day (12+) in shifts, feeling exhausted and mentally blank. Waking up tired again and feeling sleepy like an hour after waking up, and feeling tired the entire day.

The worst part? If I sleep irregularly or take naps, I get taunted or scolded, and I don’t have the freedom to just rest and explain it’s caffeine withdrawal at home.

Ever feel like everyone around you is making money trading crypto, but you have no idea where to start? Yeah, me too.

Recently, I came across **[CezFondBit](https://tinyurl.com/ytts2ba3)**, and I was curious—**is it the real deal** or just another flashy name in a crowded space?

With the rise of platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, people are flocking to automated trading systems. CezFondBit seems to ride that wave while offering some cool features that make it stand out. If you're like most of us—curious about crypto but cautious with your cash—this review is for you.

## What is CezFondBit?

CezFondBit is an **automated trading platform** that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, and stocks using algorithms. Think of it like a robot broker that’s working 24/7, analyzing the markets, and executing trades based on real-time data. It's designed to help beginners get started without needing to be financial wizards.

The platform claims it uses advanced AI and machine learning to scan the market and find profitable trading opportunities. Whether you're new to trading or already dabbling in crypto, **CezFondBit aims to simplify the process** by taking much of the guesswork out of it.

## Who Created CezFondBit?

There’s no clear information on the individual or team behind CezFondBit, which is kinda sketchy but also pretty common with platforms like this. To be fair, even popular platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** don’t always disclose detailed creator profiles. That said, **transparency would be nice**, especially for people who are trusting them with real money.

From what I could gather, the platform seems to be backed by a group of developers and financial analysts, but again—no official company name or leadership team listed. So while it’s not a deal-breaker, it’s something to keep in mind.

### [🔥 Start Trading with CezFondBit Today](https://tinyurl.com/ytts2ba3)
## How Does CezFondBit Work?

CezFondBit works by using **automated trading bots** that scan the market 24/7 and execute trades on your behalf. Once you deposit funds and set your trading preferences, the platform uses its algorithms to identify potential price movements and act on them at lightning speed.

It’s not magic, though. The algorithm uses a combination of **technical indicators**, **market trends**, and **historical data** to make decisions. You can either let the bot do its thing or fine-tune your strategy based on your risk tolerance. There’s also a **demo mode**, which is great for testing before putting real money on the line.

## CezFondBit Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here's what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to use, even for beginners
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes (not just crypto)
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (within 24–48 hours)
- ✅ Real-time market data
- ✅ Custom alerts and settings

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lack of transparency about founders
- ❌ No dedicated mobile app
- ❌ Regulation status unclear

That’s the million-dollar question, right?

From my experience—and based on what’s available online—**CezFondBit doesn’t seem like a scam**. It functions as advertised, and I didn’t encounter any shady practices. However, the **lack of transparency about the team** and **unclear regulation** are valid concerns.

Any suggestions beyond the basic research?

I had an amazing experience the day after I built my alter to her. I got a random delivery of someone else's groceries with my own. 

I was laying down, accidentally napping when it arrived and I heard a woman's voice close by (I was completely alone upstairs in bed) which woke me up and had that ""oh snap!"" moment of panic suddenly remembering my groceries, afraid I'd left them out there too long. So strange.

I got a surprise of:

Strawberries
Pork Sausage
Cookie Dough
Caramel Almond Milk Coffee Creamer
And... Beets??

The more I looked into Freyja I realized the connection of these items to her. Except the beets.

I offered my Lady Strawberries. Made some coffee with the creamer. I didn't get around to making the sausage or cookies (I did nibble the dough) and had no idea what to do with the beets. I hope I didn't offend her by not using everything, but I hit burn out easily and was just too tired to cook.

*July 14, 2025*

My sister recently told me she has been getting coffee regularly with an ex-girlfriend whom broke up with me way back in 2005. She hid it from me for over 2 months and then when she eventually told me and asked if I was okay with it I had no visible reaction and asked her what she wanted from me.

This ex and I dated from 1999-2005 from the ages of 14-20. She was cheating on me for the last 2 years and left me for the guy. It was 20 years ago. I’m 40 now. I was heartbroken but dealt with it and moved on. I have a wife I’ve been married to for 12 years. I’m a dad to 3 kids. Why would I care about someone from 20 years ago?

My sister is frustrated because I have no reaction she wants to know I’m okay with it or not. They were good friends back then but stopped talking when the breakup happened but she says it’s like all that time hasn’t passed. I guess she wants my approval? Like I said I literally don’t care. If she wants to talk to her that’s fine but I won’t be interested. It’s her life. She can talk to who she wants.

ETA: my sister also felt as betrayed as I did about the cheating hence why they stopped talking but again the whole affair was 20 years ago and I dealt with the hurt and have moved on from it. I genuinely don’t feel weird if my sister is talking to her again.

- 

I can see why she may feel guilty because she was swiftly on my side and felt extremely hurt and betrayed too but again it was a very long time ago and I literally don’t care who she talks to as it’s not like it just happened.

- 

She said apparently she was out getting stuff for my nieces when she bumped into my ex by chance. They talked for a bit, ended up exchanging numbers, have been talking most days doing a lot of catch up and have been getting coffee at least once a week now

*July 15, 2025, 1 day later*

I realised I had never given my sister an exact answer just that I had no visible reaction just that I asked her what she wanted from me and she was frustrated over it.

I ended up calling her not that long ago and we talked about it. I asked why she felt so strongly about wanting to know my feelings about it and a lot of you suspected she wanted approval and you were right. I explained in my original post that my sister and ex were quite good friends and that the friendship ended cos I got cheated on and my sister also felt betrayed. The two hadn’t spoken in 20 years.

When my sister and my ex were friends they did a lot with me and together. They did a lot together and were almost like best friends snd my sister told me that of course she was pissed and felt betrayed about the cheating but also sad because she lost her only genuine friend at that time. I know she has really struggled to maintain good friendships so she said when she happened to bump into my ex by chance and that they picked up where they left from, she leapt at the chance to kickstart their friendship. She said it’s like a fog has been lifted from her and that she feels like she has her best friend back. She said she wanted to tell me but thought I’d be weird about it because at the time, I was so cut up about the breakup. She feels really guilty for being happy about rekindling a friendship with someone who caused me so much pain.

After hearing all that I understand why she wants to maintain the friendship and why she didn’t want to tell me. I explicitly told her that I have no reaction to it because without sounding like a dick I really don’t care who she spends her time with. I told her I feel enough time has passed that I can accept my ex is in her life, especially since my sister told me she is still with the man she left me for and they are married and have a family so they are obviously serious. She also said her daughters (my nieces) are the same age as my ex’s kids and that it would be good for the kids to be friends too which I get as they don’t have many. I like I said have also moved on and have been married for 12 years and I have 3 kids. I basically told my sister if she is looking for my blessing, she has it but that I won’t be involved or really interested in the friendship cos it doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. I also told her she shouldn’t feel guilty as it’s happened, it’s done and I moved on and recovered from it. Like if I saw the ex I would be civil but I wouldn’t be weird or anything about it cos again, I don’t really care. Plus from the sounds of it the ex will really only be mingling with my sister, potentially my BIL and their kids so I may not see her at all.

She left the call feeling at least happier and I’m just glad she has a friend back I suppose. Not an exciting update or anything but I guess a good outcome. We were just mature and civilised.

*Quick note: If this type of post isn't allowed in this group, please accept my apologies! I’m looking for feedback, and my genuine intent is simply to share a free resource to help social workers, especially recent MSW grads on their licensure journey.*

I'm one of the co-creators behind **License Journey** ([licensejourney.com](https://www.licensejourney.com/)). I came up with the idea for this tool, and then worked closely with an expert developer, providing continuous feedback that shaped it into what it is today. I’ve had many ideas and I’m seeing it come to life, but I would really like any suggestions from this community on how I can make it better. What do you all think?

Our goal was to create a **completely free** online resource designed to help aspiring social workers, especially recent MSW grads, navigate their LCSW hours and prepare for licensure in California.

I started License Journey because I was tired of seeing other platforms charge so much. My goal is to give back to the social work community with a high-quality and accessible resource. 

While we are currently only available in CA for LCSW licenses, my vision is to add more states and licenses like LMFT over time.

# What License Journey Provides Now

There are other tracking tools like TrackMyHours, but we offer some key differences:

* **Always Free (for now!):** Unlike services with fees, License Journey is 100% free. We want to make sure it’s perfect!  When we do introduce a paid option, our goal is for it to be affordable, like a cup of coffee. We believe you deserve that kind of care and accessibility, given all the care you provide to your clients.
* **Built for Social Workers, By Social Workers:** Our platform is designed with your specific needs in mind, offering intuitive tracking and helpful resources.
* **Proven Success:** We have over **600 users**, and some have finished logging their 3000 hours using License Journey!
* **More Than Just Tracking - Your Interview & Supervision Survival Guide:** Beyond hour tracking, we're building out a valuable **blog section** with practical advice. One key area we're focusing on is empowering new MSWs during job interviews.I personally experienced the frustration of being hired, only to discover a 6-month probation period before supervision began. Even after that, my supervisor refused to meet the California BBS requirements for adequate supervision (which required an additional hour of individual/triadic OR 2 hours of group supervision, to claim more than 10 clinical hours weekly), and wouldn't allow another social worker to be my second supervisor… This forced me to pay out-of-pocket for supervision outside of work hours. We want to help you avoid similar pitfalls!Our blog will offer concrete tips on crucial questions to ask during job interviews, specifically about supervision, probationary periods, and ensuring your future supervisor meets all BBS requirements from day one. We want you to be fully informed and advocate for the supervision you need and deserve.

# We're Growing – Share Your Ideas!

Right now, License Journey focuses on California LCSW requirements, but we plan to expand to other states. If you're an MSW outside of California and interested in using a free tool like ours, we'd love your feedback as we plan our expansion!

# Ready to Start Your Journey?

Visit[ licensejourney.com](https://www.licensejourney.com/)! We believe License Journey can be a valuable asset on your path to becoming a licensed clinical social worker.

If you start using License Journey, we'd love to collaborate with you to make it perfect – our contact information is always easy to find for any thoughts or suggestions.

*October 17, 2024*

I (23F) am getting married in January and just found out my fiancée, Mark (25M, fake name) invited his old situationship to our wedding without consulting me.


For context: Me and Mark met on a dating app two years ago after he “”broke up”” a relationship. To be honest, it’s quite confusing what he and Tracy (22F) had. 


They met because of a mutual friend and started to develop feelings for each other. Mark told me they never dated and slept together, but it was more than friendship. Until today he keeps her love letters, gifts and talks about her.


Tracy and him tried to stay in contact after the break up, staying friends but she ghosted him after finding out we started to date. From what I saw in her social media, she’s in a relationship, so I’m not worried about her trying to get with my fiancée again.


They haven’t been in contact for 2 years, but he still has her number and email. I found out about him inviting her after I checked again our guest list and finding her name. 


I know Tracy is not a threat to our relationship, but Mark inviting her behind my back makes me feel bad about our whole wedding. He told me he doesn’t feel anything for her, yet he made sure to send her an invitation. 


This is probably me being insecure, but my fear of him not getting over her is slowly creeping inside my heart. 


I don’t want to lose him.

I don’t get why he is not over her especially if they were never a thing. From what Mark told me, he was the one who didn’t wanted a relationship since Tracy “just started life”.

- 

*(downvoted)*
I don’t know why he is not over her even after two years of no contact. I know Tracy is part of his past, his story but it’s been such a long time.

- 

He doesn’t talk about her all the time. It’s some comments from time to time.

I believe that is not right to erase her since Tracy was part of his story, but I did got the ick in the beginning when I saw her letters and gifts

- 

Her going to the wedding doesn’t make me uncomfortable since I know she won’t do anything. The problem is my fiancée and the fact he invited her to the wedding without notifying me.

If Mark wanted her there, fine. But I just HATE the fact he didn’t told me beforehand and it’s making me think he lied about getting over her.

- 

They are in no contact for two years. She immediately blocked him after knowing we were seeing each other.

The whole situation is making me second guess our wedding.

- 

I haven’t confronted Mark yet. I just found out a few hours ago and I’m waiting for him to come back.

- 

Tracy has a boyfriend and is expecting. Also, she was the one who blocked him everywhere after finding out we were dating.

- 

He has her email and I believe she didn’t blocked him there. There was her name, but Tracy didn’t confirmed her presence

*October 19, 2024, 2 days later*

After reading the comments and talking with some friends, my heart finally understood Mark never really got over Tracy.


In the beginning, I was in denial, but I went out with Tom (24M), his best friend of years to understand about what really happened between them.


From what he told me, Tracy and Mark met because of some friends in common. She just got into the university and was 17 at the time, while Mark was already almost graduating. 


They stayed friend for two years and feelings started to blossom. Mark was already working while she was still in college, he only wanted to formally date her after her graduation, so it was never a thing, even though they shared love letters, gifts and shared almost every holiday together. 


Tom told me everyone from their old friend group thought they would marry since they were so sweet together. So, their breakup was really unpredictable.


Tracy was the one who broke up with Mark due to their religious values not lining up, as she wanted to save herself until marriage. In the end, they decided it was better to go separate ways and maybe try again after a few years.


But after me and Mark started to date, Tracy realized that it was pointless to wait for him and started to see other people too, so she blocked in every thing, except email just to have a clean beginning.


In the end, I finally realized Mark is just hopeful that Tracy would come back to him due to their talks of trying again after a while. It honestly hurt so much, as I loved him so much. 


I still didn’t confronted him since I’m still shaken up, but I don’t know if this marriage will happen. I am going to update once I calm down and confront him.

*October 25, 2024, 2 days later*

It’s been a while since the last update and I’m here to announce the wedding has been called off. My parents are the one canceling everything for me, it’s like I returned to my childhood when mom and dad had to solve my problems.


I confronted Mark after talking with Tom and made him aware of everything I’ve been dealing. His reaction at the beginning was dismissive and was almost as if he was trying to escape from this situation.


In the end, Mark said he never loved someone like Tracy because it was pure and innocent. She reminded him that not everything is about carnal desire and in the darkest moments of his life, Tracy was like a sunlight.


Hearing the man you love admitting how much he loved another woman is so hurtful. During the talk, I started to cry, bawling my eyes out. Mark had the audacity to say he loves me, but it’s a different kind of love.


I asked why he invited her to our wedding and he was speechless. Why he had to throw away our future for something in the past?! This hurts so much.


Mark told me he knew Tracy didn’t blocked him on e-mail, since he was the one who helped her get her first job and a lot of professional stuff was also involved. This is how he was able to send her our wedding invitation, but he “meant no harm”.


When I asked what he meant with this, Mark just said he wanted to make her watch us together and realize what she lost because he was hurt that Tracy was pregnant and not married.


The moment Mark mentioned about Tracy’s pregnancy, a red alarm started to echo in my head. “How did you know about her pregnancy? You said she blocked you every where.” I could see panic in his eyes as he started to stutter.


In the end, I made him give me his phone and I found out more than 5 accounts to stalk Tracy. My stomach felt sick and the urge to vomit was overwhelming. 


In the end, I decided to call off the engagement since he was a creep. Mark threw himself on the floor asking for forgiveness and he loves me, just in a different way compared to Tracy and was just hurt that she gave herself to another man while he begged her countless times for sex. 


This made me feel even more disgusted with him because he felt entitled to her virginity and body. I left without taking even a bag with me. Everything is just too much. I can’t believe I spent two years loving a stalker, a manchild.


Oh, I also told Tracy everything and his accounts. I don’t know if she saw my messages, but I hope she does. The jealousy I once felt for her transformed into pity as no woman should go through what Mark has done. 


Mark wants to meet up with me and doesn’t want to break up, but I’m just so tired. 

SMALL UPDATE: Tracy messaged me and wants to “grab a coffee” with me.

*October 26, 2024, 9 days later*

I think this is my last update, since I’ve already met up with Tracy and talked about what happened.

Me and her met at a cafe and in the beginning I was really nervous, as I didn’t know what was her reaction because her reply was only “Hi, let’s talk over a cup of coffee:)” 

When I was waiting for her, I could feel my back sweating and overall, lots of emotion. Tracy arrived and I finally understood why Mark was so obsessed with her as she is definitely one of the most beautiful women I saw. She’s pretty on the pictures, but personally she looks better.

Tracy said hello to me and asked if I’m willing to go to her house to talk, since being outside for too long makes her really tired. We ordered some coffee to go and it was super awkward. 

So now let’s talk about what she told me: first of all, she apologized for being the reason why now I’m single which I assured her is not her fault. 

Tracy said she received the invitation, but was simply not interested in participating in our wedding as she was already in a happy relationship and is pointless to see a person from the past.

With the story Tom and Mark told me, I got curious and asked about them “staying friends” as it sounded like she wanted to stay with him after the break up and it’s the polar opposite of her behavior. Tracy was extremely uncomfortable with this question, but still explained to me why she said that.

In the beginning, she was really in love with Mark because he was her first love. She described him as a protector, someone trustworthy, handsome and kind as he always showered her in gifts and travels.

Everything was fine and sweet but over time, Mark started to beg her for sex so much to the point of her pretending to be sick just to avoid him. She just didn’t wanted to sleep with him and had some sort of blockage, like a sixth sense telling her to not do this.


She was sick and tired about all of this and used the fact that her parents are extremely religious to justify why sex was off the chart. This lead to a fight, which Mark never told me and them breaking up. 

But two weeks after, they started to talk again as she felt in debt with him as he helped her get a job in a prestigious company and he spent a lot of money on her with trips, foods and presents. One of the gifts was a Rolex for her 18th birthday, which made me mad since he NEVER spent so much money on me.


So when Tracy found out me and Mark was seeing each other, she felt relieved and finally had a proper reason to block him everywhere since he was still sometimes hinting about them sleeping together.


In the end, I told her in the entire relationship, Mark would sometimes talk about her and in the beginning it was kind of weird, but I just brushed it off since she was part of his story. 


Oh, I also talked about Mark’s numerous accounts and in the beginning she didn’t believed me. But I showed her the accounts I knew, which was creepy since they all had female names, followers and pictures. All of them looked real.


Her account is public, so I asked Tracy to make it private. She made a new account with her Korean name and deactivated the old one.


We had fun and became friends. She is a really sweet person and I saw how her boyfriend treated her like a queen. I’m happy she found love and got rid of Mark.

># [Update 4 [NEW]](https://np.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g7hnh0/update_my_fianc%C3%A9e_invited_his_ex_situationship/)
*July 10, 2025, about 9 months later*

Hi, guys! Recently, I logged into my account again and decided to give an update about my life as it is so crazy for me that almost a year ago, my tears were uncontrollable because of a man. 


Tracy got married a few weeks ago and I was invited. It was a beautiful ceremony and her baby was part of it. It was refreshing to see the glow on her face and that she found the one. We’re not too close, but still is nice to hang out with her and accompany her journey as a wife and mother.


Meanwhile, I am not interested in relationships for a while. I got a promotion and thinking about moving to another state as my company offered a position with better pay. Not being engaged actually made me concentrate a lot more on my job as I became able to do more extra hours. 


So, I don’t have much updates about Mark since I cut off contact with him, his family and friends that took his side. The last thing I heard is that he was telling every one how controlling and abusive I was and HE had to call off our engagement. 


This is not my business anymore and what he says doesn’t matter. But Mark is definitely miserable. I am going to take this summer and go to Greece just to celebrate life. 


Thank you all for the advices. If I didn’t posted on Reddit almost a year ago, I would’ve been married to a guy who never saw me as first option.

1m15drw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1m15drw/a_look_at_all_14_under_canvas_locations_in_the_us/,A Look at All 14 Under Canvas Locations in the US,"# 🏕️ Ultimate Under Canvas Glamping Guide: Luxury Meets Wilderness Across America

Hey Travel Trotters! I've been exploring the glamping scene lately and had to share my experiences with Under Canvas, the ultimate luxury camping operation that's changing how we experience America's natural wonders.

For those tired of roughing it but still wanting that immersive outdoor experience, Under Canvas has created the perfect middle ground with their 14 locations across the US. I've visited several, and they're genuinely game-changers!

## 🌲 Why Under Canvas Stands Out

Since launching in 2012, Under Canvas has mastered the art of placing luxury safari-style tents in some of America's most jaw-dropping landscapes. Think plush king beds, en-suite bathrooms with hot showers, and wood-burning stoves - all while being minutes from national parks!

The canvas walls let you feel connected to nature (you'll hear the wind and rainfall), but you'll stay perfectly comfortable. It's camping for people who hate camping but love nature.

## 🏞️ Must-Visit Locations That Blew Me Away

**Zion** - My personal favorite! Waking up to those red sandstone cliffs is otherworldly. The stargazing here is incredible, and you're just minutes from the park entrance. Open March-November, which gives you plenty of options. Try the sunset yoga if it's available!

**Glacier** - If you want that true wilderness feel, the Montana location delivers! The backdrop of snow-capped peaks with wildflower meadows in summer is straight out of a magazine. Since it's only open June-September, book early! Pro tip: request a tent with mountain views.

**Great Smoky Mountains** - Perfect for families! Set on 180 acres of lush Tennessee forest, they offer kid-friendly suites and awesome camp programs that kept my nephew entertained for days. The fall colors here (April-November) are unbelievable.

**Acadia** - For East Coast travelers, this Maine waterfront property is magical. The lakeside views are so peaceful, and exploring the nearby coastal towns gave us the perfect mix of nature and New England charm. May-October operation means you can catch gorgeous fall foliage.

## 💡 Insider Tips From My Stays

1. **Book the Stargazer tent** when available - the viewing window above the bed for nighttime star-watching is worth every penny!

2. **Pack layers** regardless of season. Temperatures can fluctuate wildly, and while the wood stoves keep tents cozy, mornings can be chilly.

3. **Pre-order s'mores kits** for the communal fire pit - they're better quality than what you'd bring yourself, and it's one less thing to pack.

4. **Charge devices during dinner** at the main lodge. Most tents don't have outlets (by design - it's about disconnecting!).

5. **Take advantage of the free activities** - many locations offer yoga, live music, and ranger talks that really enhance the experience.

## 🗓️ When To Go & Booking Strategy

Most locations operate seasonally (typically April-October), with desert locations like Moab and Lake Powell opening earlier in March.

**For best availability:** Book 6-9 months in advance, especially for summer weekends and holiday periods.

**For deals:** Look at shoulder seasons (early May or late September) when weather is still good but crowds are thinner.

**For specific parks:** 
- Yellowstone locations: Book June-August for ideal weather
- Desert locations (Moab, Zion, Bryce): May and September offer perfect temperatures
- Great Smokies: October for fall foliage is spectacular but books up fast

## 🎒 What To Pack That Most People Forget

- Headlamp or flashlight (paths are lit but not brightly)
- Portable phone charger
- Slippers for inside the tent
- Eye mask if you're sensitive to early sunrise
- Reusable water bottle (they have filling stations)
- Binoculars for wildlife viewing

## 🤔 Is Under Canvas Worth The Cost?

Let's be real - with prices ranging from $250-$500+ per night, it's not cheap. But after staying at several locations, I firmly believe the value is there if:

- You want national park access without the campground hassle
- Hotel options near parks are limited or uninspiring
- You value experiences over traditional accommodations
- You're celebrating a special occasion (they make it memorable!)

The price includes the incredible locations, quality furnishings, and that impossible-to-quantify feeling of sipping coffee on your private deck while watching the sunrise over untouched wilderness.

## 🌟 Beyond Traditional Under Canvas: Special Options

If you're looking for an even more elevated experience, check out their newer ULUM Moab property. It's their ultra-premium concept with expanded amenities like a pool, full restaurant, and larger tents. Pricier, but absolutely worth it for a special trip.

## What is Argent Zilo?

Argent Zilo is an **automated cryptocurrency trading platform** that claims to help users make smarter trades using real-time market data and algorithmic tools. Think of it like a high-tech assistant that helps you trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets—even if you’re not a trading expert.

The platform focuses on **user-friendliness**, meaning you don’t need to be a chart guru or have Wall Street experience to get started. It offers tools like customizable alerts, multiple asset trading, and mobile access, which are pretty handy whether you're casually trading or trying to go full degen.

## Who Created Argent Zilo?

This is where things get a little murky. The developers behind Argent Zilo haven’t made their identities public, which is **pretty common** in the crypto space (think Satoshi levels of anonymity). Based on the platform’s design and functionality, it seems like it was built by a team with fintech and trading experience.

That said, I’d love a little more transparency here. While anonymity can help protect developers from legal or political issues, it also makes it harder for users to fully trust the product. Still, lack of public info isn’t a red flag on its own—other platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** operate similarly.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Argent Zilo Today](https://tinyurl.com/ymdud9ur)
## How Does Argent Zilo Work?

Argent Zilo uses **automated trading algorithms** that scan crypto markets 24/7, looking for profitable opportunities. When a trade signal is triggered, the system can either notify you or execute the trade automatically, depending on your settings.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what happens behind the scenes:

- **Data Collection:** The platform pulls live data from global crypto exchanges.
- **Signal Generation:** It uses technical indicators and machine learning to identify potential trades.
- **Execution:** Depending on your settings, trades are either suggested or placed automatically.
- **Tracking:** You can monitor profits, losses, and performance metrics in real-time.

The automation is ideal if you want to trade without being glued to charts all day. But of course, **no bot is perfect**, and markets are always unpredictable.

## Argent Zilo Pros and Cons

Like any trading tool, Argent Zilo isn’t flawless. Here’s a quick breakdown of the highs and lows:

### Pros:
- **Beginner-friendly interface** (great for crypto newbies)
- **Supports multiple assets**, not just Bitcoin
- **Real-time data and analytics**
- **Customizable alerts and notifications**
- **Mobile access for on-the-go trading**
- **Demo account lets you test without risking real money**

### Cons:
- **Lack of transparency** about the founding team
- **Requires a $250 minimum deposit** to start trading
- **Risk of loss** still present (as with all trading platforms)
- **No advanced charting tools** for expert traders

### [👉 Open Your Argent Zilo Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/ymdud9ur)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Argent Zilo?

Argent Zilo is accessible on pretty much anything with a screen and internet:

- **Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)**
- **iOS devices (iPhone, iPad)**
- **Android smartphones and tablets**

The web version is solid, but the mobile app is where it really shines. It's responsive, fast, and doesn’t feel like a clunky afterthought. You can check charts, tweak settings, or even make trades while standing in line for coffee. Super convenient.

## Argent Zilo – Supported Countries

Argent Zilo is available in **most countries**, especially across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. However, there are some restrictions due to local regulations (e.g., users in the U.S. and Canada may face limitations depending on location).

Here are some of the **supported regions**:

- UK
- Australia
- Germany
- South Africa
- India
- Singapore

Before signing up, it's best to check if your country is fully supported. The signup form usually blocks unsupported locations automatically, but double-checking doesn’t hurt.

## Argent Zilo – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Argent Zilo’s backbone is its **live market data engine**, which scans the crypto markets non-stop. This means you’re getting signals based on the most up-to-date info, not stale data from 10 minutes ago.

This is a big deal because in crypto, **10 minutes can mean a 10% price swing**. Having real-time insights can be the difference between catching a pump or buying just before a dump.

### User-Friendly Interface

This is one of the areas where Argent Zilo really shines. The UI is **clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overload you** with charts and jargon. You get just the right amount of info to make decisions, without feeling overwhelmed.

Even if you’ve never traded before, you’ll feel right at home after a few minutes of clicking around.

### Mobile Accessibility

The mobile app is **fast and fully functional**, letting you trade on the go with ease. You can view your portfolio, get alerts, execute trades, and even chat with support—all from your phone.

This is perfect if you’re someone who doesn’t want to be tied to a laptop.

### Customizable Alerts

Want to know when Bitcoin hits $30k? Or when Ethereum climbs 5% in an hour? Argent Zilo lets you **set custom alerts** for price movements, volume spikes, and other metrics.

These alerts make it easier to jump on opportunities—or dodge disasters—without constantly watching the charts.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Argent Zilo supports trading on a range of assets, including:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Litecoin (LTC)**
- **Ripple (XRP)**
- **Altcoins and tokens**

This gives you more flexibility and helps you diversify. You’re not stuck trading just BTC like with some simpler platforms.

## Is Argent Zilo a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t look like a scam**.

It has several legit features, works across multiple devices, and offers a demo account. The automated trading system is similar to those used by other well-known platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**.

That said, **always trade responsibly**. Just because a platform is legit doesn’t mean it’s risk-free. The crypto market is volatile, and even the best algorithm can’t predict everything.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Argent Zilo?

To get started with real trading, you’ll need to deposit **$250 USD**. That’s pretty standard for platforms in this category.

This deposit isn’t a fee—it’s your trading capital. You can use it to place real trades, and you can withdraw it (plus profits) anytime.

### Argent Zilo Customer Support

Customer support is actually decent. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** (during market hours)
- **Email support** (response within 24 hours)

I tested both and got helpful responses, though the live chat was faster. Would love to see 24/7 support in the future, but it’s not a dealbreaker.

## How do you start trading on Argent Zilo?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Argent Zilo website and fill out the signup form. You’ll need:

- Your name
- Email address
- Phone number

No long forms or KYC docs at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signup, you’ll be connected to a **partner broker** where you can make your $250 deposit. Most major payment methods are accepted:

- Credit/Debit cards
- Bank transfer
- E-wallets (varies by region)

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can switch to live trading or test things out with the **demo mode**. You can tweak risk settings, trading pairs, and auto-trading preferences.

## How to Delete an Argent Zilo Account?

If you ever want to bail, deleting your account is pretty simple. Just:

1. Go to your account settings.
2. Click on “Delete Account.”
3. Confirm via email.

Make sure to **withdraw any funds** before doing this, as deletion may lock your wallet.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Argent Zilo Today](https://tinyurl.com/ymdud9ur)
## The Verdict

Argent Zilo is a solid choice for beginners and casual traders who want to dip their toes into crypto without learning every candle pattern. It offers **automation, real-time data, and a slick UI** that makes trading accessible—even fun.

It’s not perfect. The anonymous team and lack of advanced tools might turn off some serious traders. But if you’re looking for a smart, simple way to trade crypto, **Argent Zilo is worth checking out**.

1m15aho,https://v.redd.it/21tnb7zfi6df1,"Pro-Brewer, I need your advice.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been brewing with the V60 for a few months now, just enough time to realize how much I don’t know yet. So far, it seems to me that it's all about control and clarity (modifying the brew ratio, pour technique, and grind size to bring out the nuances of the beans). In a nutshell, though, I just brew coffee on top of a filter and hope I get something enjoyable in my cup.

Over time, I started letting go of the pressure to chase those tasting notes listed on the coffee bag. I used to feel frustrated when I couldn’t find that “berry” or “floral” profile, no matter how many times I tweaked the recipe. But recently, I’ve been more focused on making a cup that I enjoy, something that isn’t too bitter, too sour, or too weak. It doesn’t always match the label, but if it tastes good to me, then it's good enough.

**That said**, I still have so much to learn. For those of you who’ve been brewing for a while, what advice would you give to someone still getting their bearings? Not just technical tips (though I’d appreciate those too), but anything around how you approach tasting, how you developed your palate, or even how you learned to slow down and just enjoy the ritual of brewing. I’d love to hear your perspective!

Thanks for reading.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **San Diego FC vs. Toronto FC: A Tale of Two Teams (One’s a Soccer Dynasty-in-Training, the Other’s a Traveling Circus)**

**Parsing the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (And Neither Does San Diego’s Offense)**  
Let’s start with the numbers because, in sports, math is the original “hot take.” San Diego FC, an *expansion team*, is a staggering favorite at decimal odds of **1.3 to 1.36**, translating to an implied probability of **73.5% to 76.9%** to win. For context, that’s the statistical confidence of a cat knocking over a glass of water—inevitable, messy, and Toronto FC’s defense probably isn’t going to stop it. Toronto’s odds? A laughable **7.0 to 8.8**, implying a **11.4% to 14.3%** chance to win. If you bet on Toronto, you’re either a masochist or a fan of dramatic, last-second collapses. The draw? A meager **5.25 to 5.8** (17.2% to 19.0%), which feels about right—Toronto’s probably not losing by 5, but they’re not exactly booking a victory either.

**Digesting the News: San Diego’s Star Power vs. Toronto’s “We’re-Still-Here” Tour**  
San Diego is the golden child of MLS expansion teams, leading the Western Conference with a **13-6-3 record (42 points)**. Their attack? A nuclear reactor. Anders Dreyer (11 goals, **15 assists**) is the league’s assist king, while Chucky Lozano (6 goals, 8 assists) is his trusty sidekick. Together, they’ve scored at least two goals in **five straight games**. Even after losing forward Milan Iloski to Denmark, they’re still scoring like it’s their job—which it is.

Toronto, meanwhile, is the sports equivalent of a group project that forgot to meet. At **4-11-6 (18 points)**, they’re 14th in the Eastern Conference and coming off a **1-1 tie with Atlanta United**—a result so underwhelming it made their coach reach for his coffee mid-postgame interview. Captain

My (33F) husband (34M) and I got married nearly three years ago. We were together for two years prior to that, a lot of it LDR. He was in the military and I would travel to see him as it was easier than him traveling to see me at the time.

He moved to my home country, and he immediately hated it. He didn’t make an effort to make friends, his income was low, he would complain about the country itself (not a perfect place by any means, but not as bad as he made it out to be). I’m not qualified to diagnose him, but I’m nearly certain he is depressed. 

He prefers to stay home, so we stay home. He likes to go jogging, so he goes jogging. He doesn’t drive here even though I’ve encouraged him to get a car he cites financial issues (even though he has savings and could prioritise a cheap vehicle). 

Mere months into our marriage we were already arguing. Our fights have always been quite ugly. The only way he can be described is having an anger problem. The smallest most ridiculously small fight will set him off - because he feels as though I’m not listening to him or I’m not on his team or I’m picking a fight or whatever else. The issue is never about the first instance - which I walk on eggshells to avoid - it’s always about how we fight. 

He tells me to “fuck off”, he tells me he doesn’t want to be with me, he tells me he doesn’t love me. Then we resolve and he apologises. He says he was mad and that he didn’t mean it. 

He’s told me how unhappy he is here and I get it, I’ve told him I’m willing to move to his home country - uproot my entire life and move across the world with him. The documentation is taking forever (not from our end) to be processed, and we’ve now been at it for 18 months - this has been the plan we are working towards. Our house that we own together is in escrow, we’ve picked out a shipping company for our things, I’ve applied for so many jobs and I always get rejected because I can’t legally work in that country yet - makes sense but I kept trying. He applies for jobs sporadically, whenever I tell him he needs to do more it becomes a fight “don’t pressure me” he says. 

We’ve done couples counselling and not stuck to it - we both didn’t find it that helpful. I go to therapy myself, I’ve asked him time and time again to go but he went once (had a really interesting breakthrough) and never went back. The arguments have escalated - he called me a “fucking bitch” last night and threw away the cold brew he was making me because I didn’t “appreciate it” enough. It’s always something - I do things for him all the time and simple smile or thank you will suffice in terms of gratitude but for him I feel like he needs a declaration of thanks every time he does anything for me otherwise I’m “ungrateful”. The coffee thing really hurt me - it was so vindictive and unkind. 

He’s never physically hurt me but I do get scared of his rage. 

This week I’ve been recovering from minor facial surgery - I had an upper bleph to correct asymmetry. He managed to be this unkind to me whilst my face was bandaged and I was hopped up on all my medication. I don’t get it. 

We both come from divorced family set ups, and I’ve mentioned how we clearly don’t have the tools to work through a fight before and he has agreed (when he has been calm). 

I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I’ve done all the legwork in terms of our move, I’ve committed to it wholeheartedly. I work on myself. And he just continues to chip away at me - at this point I am afraid to confide in my friends about how bad it is because I don’t think i could handle them hating him. 

Yesterday’s fight ended with him apologising and saying he’ll book an appointment - whilst also saying that he didnt appreciate that I pressured him into doing so. He always says he’ll leave me and yesterday was the first time I told him to go ahead if that’s what he wants - we have no children and our house is already being sold. He didn’t like that. He started saying that I seemed to have made up my mind that I don’t want to be with him etc. at this point I feel like I’m getting the ick - I can’t be doing this anymore. 

How much of this is genuinely depression and will change with treatment/therapy/a new environment and how much of this is personality traits I didn’t see in the first three years? 

I’m so conflicted.

This was longer than intended - thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far. ",0,1752646970.0,Marriage,4,0.5,False

Their hearts belonged to the same woman: Janet Jameson, the butler's daughter.Even their dying words were the same: Don't marry me.So in this life, I would not waste my time on anyone who does not truly want me.""If I must marry for the sake of the family, I choose Samuel Lockwood,"" I told my parents.""Samuel? Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.\*\*\*Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""""Because...""Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.She did not want someone who did not want her.So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""Brent and Cassandra were stunned.""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.""Which hospital?""There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""Chapter 2After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.""Leave the coffee and get out.""Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.Chapter 3After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""""How much did you hear just now?""""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""Chapter 4After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... """"There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.So, no, she could never compete with Janet.Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.And Emma would never be their wife again.Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.""What's this?""Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?""",1,1752646940.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

So I built [my own version of Telegram](https://intentchat.app/) with AI features like automatic replies, real-time message
translation, and voice-to-text. The app is called Intent, and it’s my little passion project.Feels so
satisfying to see it actually working in real conversations. Like... who knew I’d get this excited over
smooth translations and AI replies that my friends couldn’t even tell were AI?
If you’re a regular Telegram user or just curious about this kind of thing, I’d love for you to give it a try
and share any feedback or ideas for improvement. I’ll buy you a coffee for your thoughts",2,1752646902.0,reactnative,1,0.75,False

1m158br,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m158br/dealing_with_cutting_off_relationship_with_direct/,Dealing with cutting off relationship with direct family members,"Hi all,

  
I'm going through the painful decision of cutting off any relationship with my direct family, but it hurts me so much, and my head can't stop thinking about it.  

**TLDR:** I moved back to my home country and stayed with my mom while we look for our own place. She’s been complaining about me and my boyfriend behind our backs to my brother and the rest of the family, even though we help with everything at home. I found out by accident, confronted her, and she reacted by saying she’d cut me out of her will and even threatened to end her life. Now I feel done with both her and my brother. We get the keys to our apartment in 15 days, but my head won’t stop spinning. I feel like the black sheep, the enemy, and I’m scared of what people will say if I cut ties.

Sorry for the long text.

  
**Some context:**

I recently moved back to my home country after a few years living abroad. My boyfriend and I are staying with my mom, who is alone since my father passed away in January this year, while we find our own apartment. I always had a good relationship with my mom — or at least I thought so.

I have a brother who is 9 years older than me, living with his wife and their 3-year-old daughter. His relationship with my parents was more difficult than mine: he clashed a lot with my father, but he was able to bend my parents to his will because he gets very aggressive when confronted. Meanwhile, my mom has always complained about him to me.

My relationship with my brother hasn't been the greatest: since he is much older than me, I never saw him as a brother, but as an adult who lived with me and my parents. As a kid, I was a bit chubby, and he always made sure to remind me that I was too fat. In my teenage years, if I dared to dress differently (like wearing a pink t-shirt), he would say, ""Where do you think you're going dressed like that?"" All these events severely harmed my self-esteem, and I'm still dealing with that. When we became adults, he tried to get closer to me, but I always felt uncomfortable with him, so I never reciprocated.

I've always been the ""different one"" in the family: I went abroad, got my university degree, and I don't follow their traditions or ways of doing things. For context, 90% of my direct family lives in the same town: my cousins (all around my brother's age), aunts, uncles, etc. My boyfriend and I have always wanted to live in the capital city because there's not much to do in my hometown, and people are generally more open-minded.

**What happened:**

  
Since we moved back, living with my mom has been a nightmare. She constantly complains about little things, makes problems out of nowhere, and speaks ill of literally everyone around her. She has no friends, doesn't like social gatherings or activities. She started telling my brother and her sisters that my boyfriend and I are not giving her attention or company, that we are using the washing machine too much, that we are wearing down her pans when we cook, etc.

A few days ago, we finally found our home. I told my mom, and she didn’t seem very happy for me. I also told my brother and sister-in-law, but no one else, as we wanted to wait until the contract was signed. Then I accidentally discovered a conversation between my mom and my brother where she was complaining that I hadn’t told my cousins (why should I?) nor the whole family. My brother replied, ""Why? They never invite anyone over. They are worse than X (a family member who is detached from the family), it’s so sad the way they behave."" My mom replied, ""I'm feeling more depressed since they are here; they are wearing my pans down; I still feel lonely.""

Actually, my brother is the one who never invites anyone to his home, and that has been secretly discussed within the family for ages. Even when we were abroad, we always opened the doors of our home to anyone who wanted to visit us.

We had a conversation with my mom two weeks ago because she stopped talking to us. We understood that we had to go the extra mile and dedicate more attention to her because she said she was feeling lonely. Since then, I offered to go to a café to have coffee together, planned some holidays together, or just listened to her. It seemed to be working until I read that chat. She never brought it up again.

I confronted my mom and told her I wouldn’t expect a mother to talk like that about her children. That if she had a problem with me or my boyfriend, we were always open to talk and discuss. I said I didn’t understand why she had to speak ill of us, especially since most of the things she said weren't true. We do the groceries, pay the bills, do the laundry, wash the dishes, clean the house, etc.

She said she would cut me out of her will (out of the blue — I don’t care about the money!) and threatened to end her life. She was more upset that I discovered the chat than about what was written. She said she was ""just venting.""

I told her I didn’t want to know anything about her or my brother anymore, that this was toxic and I didn’t want to deal with it. Now that I am going to therapy, I’ve realized that this behaviour has forced me to bend to their wishes all my life just because I am different.

We will have the keys to our apartment in 15 days, so we still have some time here. My head can’t stop thinking about everything that has happened. I feel like I don’t have a family, like I’m the black sheep, the enemy. I’m also scared of public shame, somehow.

1m157u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m157u4/what_should_i_look_for_when_buying_an_espresso/,What should I look for when buying an espresso machine?,"When I first got into making espresso at home, I had no idea where to start. There are so many espresso machines out there with different features and price points. After doing a ton of research and trying out various machines, I've learned what really matters when choosing an espresso machine.

The most important factor is the quality of the espresso it produces. You want a machine that can maintain the right temperature and pressure for optimal extraction. Look for machines with PID temperature control and at least 9 bars of pressure. This ensures you'll get rich, flavorful shots with that signature crema on top.

Size and capacity are also key considerations. Think about how much counter space you have and how many shots you typically make. If you're just making espresso for yourself, a smaller single-boiler machine might be perfect. But if you're often making drinks for multiple people, a dual-boiler machine with a larger water tank would be more convenient.

The steam wand is another crucial component, especially if you like milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. A good steam wand should produce fine, velvety microfoam. Some higher-end machines have separate boilers for steaming and brewing, allowing you to do both simultaneously.

Ease of use and cleaning are factors that often get overlooked. Trust me, you don't want a machine that's a pain to operate or maintain. Look for models with intuitive controls and parts that are easy to access and clean. Some even have automatic cleaning cycles.

Build quality and durability are worth considering too. Stainless steel construction tends to last longer than plastic. Read reviews to see how machines hold up over time.

Your budget will obviously play a big role. While you can find decent entry-level machines for under $200, investing in a higher-quality machine in the $500-$1000 range will generally give you better performance and longevity. That said, there are great options at various price points.

After trying out many machines, I've found some excellent options that tick all these boxes at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They have a curated selection of top-rated espresso machines for different needs and budgets.

Don't forget about the grinder! A good burr grinder is essential for making great espresso. Pre-ground coffee just doesn't cut it. The grind needs to be fine and consistent.

Accessories like a tamper, milk pitcher, and knock box are also worth picking up. They make the whole espresso-making process smoother and more enjoyable.

Finally, consider whether you want any extra features. Some machines have built-in grinders, programmable shot volumes, or even smartphone connectivity. While not essential, these can add convenience.

Choosing the right espresso machine might seem overwhelming at first, but focusing on these key factors will help you find one that fits your needs.
