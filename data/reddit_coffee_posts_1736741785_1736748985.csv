I have some time before I start and would like to beef up any skills that might be helpful, and generally know what to expect. 

I have more years work experience than the average associate and have been in multiple functions, so I know there a wide variety of things I could be asked to do. 

In the average day, what are you asked to do? And how much time do you spend on that kind of task?


Example:

-Build a chart in ppt that a partner drew on a blank page and send it back ASAP - 3 hours / day

-Build a financial model to predict sales, costs, capital projects, etc. - 4 hours

-Brainstorm with a team and a whiteboard on ways to approach solving a problem - never

-Provide a status update, ask for and incorporate feedback on charts in the client deck - 1 hour

-Analyze reports in excel and pick out the important info to analyze - 3 hrs

-Research industry trends, develop list of relevant metrics and best in class values - 0 hours, only on certain projects and owned by engagement managers

Hi future friends, hope you read it all! 

Had a frustrating encounter with your (boss, sibling, friend, waiter, stranger)? 

Feeling down and need an outlet? Some words of encouragement? 

Just want to chat about your favourite video games, hobbies, or shows? 

For me the company I work for just had a round of restructuring. While I wasn’t affected directly, my team shrank. It’s demoralizing, colleagues were let go, and more work is put on the survivors. Kind of sucks.

Well, I’ve got two listening ears (and reading eyes) and would love to chat with you. Looking to make new friends and connections for long term friendships, no nsfw. 

About me: 
173cm (5’9”?), slim but growing into a dad bod. Chinese
Interests:
Netflix, youtube, manga, cooking, food, coffee, drinks, video games, true crime, crunching numbers and watching the stock markets
Music wise - I enjoy a wide mix, mostly older songs from the 90s to 00s
Boybands like Westlife, BSB, NSYNC; MLTR, Greenday, Simple Plan, Coldplay; even ranging to Taylor Swift, Bieber, and EDM.

About you:
Preferably East Asian, but open to chatting with anyone to see how we get along.
Around the +65 (Singapore) time zone, but feel free to reach out from around the world! 
Petite, slim, and small, but don’t hesitate even if you’re tall.
Close to my age or younger, but 18+ only please.
Similar interests, talkative and fun, and can hold a conversation - not a fan of one word responses.
Looking for a long term online companion as well.
Willing to share / trade pics when we’re comfortable.

Bonus points if you’re in Japan because I intend to move there one day! 

Don’t be shy, tell me about yourself!

Sounds like you, and what you’re looking for?

1i07jeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i07jeo/three_weeks_in_and_think_i_am_starting_to_see_the/,Three weeks in and think I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"Posting this here because I want to track this for myself (as a reminder when the cravings hit!) and also in case it may be helpful to others.

The first few weeks being coffee-free were EXTREMELY hard. SO hard. I was absolutely exhausted (I do have chronic fatigue, and while the coffee was likely ultimately making the CFS worse, it did mask my true fatigue level quite a bit) and I couldn't focus. I could barely keep my eyes open and work was very difficult to get through. Some days I HAD to sleep 15 hours (between nighttime and naps). I felt an intense lack of motivation, body pain intensified, and I was completely depressed. It was actually so awful that I felt desperate nearly all day every day with a voice saying to ""just have a tiny cup,"" but I pushed through.

Now that I am three weeks in I am still extremely tired, but I can feel that slowly lifting a bit. The depression has lifted as well. The cravings are still there, big time. I think about having coffee multiple times a day, which is just crazy to me and really makes me realize how addicted I was, even though before I only ever had one cup of a coffee a day.

While the fatigue is not fun and is very hard to work through, I feel like my body is getting really deep and really needed rest and sleep that it hasn't had in a long time. It's also showing me what my natural baseline of energy is, which makes me realize I have a LOT more I need to do to work on my physical health.

I am noticing I feel more present and grounded and calm.  I am also getting really clear on what the addicted ""part"" of me feels like when it pops up and it's pretty wild. I don't smoke or drink, and I eat a really healthy diet, but I can feel that energy of wanting something to shift my state and it comes up intensely around wanting coffee and is pretty humbling. If it is this hard to quit coffee, I can't imagine what people addicted to more extreme things go through.

I am also realizing just how addicted our entire culture is. TV, sugar, social media/phone usage, foods, alcohol, drugs, sex, porn....the list goes on. We live in a culture of addicts and for most people they are addicted to multiple things, and it's wild to think about the impact that has on society as a whole. There also is a lot of denial around the very real issues with coffee and caffeine consumption.

Since quitting, I feel inspired to limit my phone use, I deleted social media apps from my phone, and I have been getting back to doing yoga and reading books. I feel inspired overall to keep moving towards making healthy changes for my life and I feel like I have more clarity on how to do that without coffee in my life.

This is what coffee ""offered"" me: a delicious warm drink in the morning, a moment of excitement and structure to starting my day (I have NEVER been a morning person, but once I started drinking coffee I became a morning person because I couldn't wait to get up and have my cup of coffee), energy to get through work (but it is false energy), focus and definitely a big dopamine hit (I would get so much done after having coffee in the morning and would have a big mood boost).

What it also was giving me that wasn't so great: I believe even that one cup of coffee in the am contributed to anxiety and mood instability, a crash later in the day, insomnia/lack of deep sleep, extreme migraines, reliance on something to make me feel a certain way, and being controlled by a substance (once, I was camping and didn't have matches for my stove and was in a remote area, so I couldn't boil water for my coffee and I remember it was as if the worst thing in the world was happening to me, I was in an absolute panic over not being able to have coffee, which is once again really a telling example of just how addictive coffee, even in small amounts, can be).

I am sure there is more. But I'll stop here for now. I am really thankful to have found this sub. I had been lurking on it for quite some time and all the posts I read are what finally gave me the push to quit coffee myself. Hoping I can stick with it. I do feel like every day gets a little bit easier.",1,1736748198.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 26th, 1993

The hum of the Rust Bucket's engine is a constant, grating buzz against the drumming in my ears. This isn't the usual low thrum of road trip anticipation; it's the high-pitched whine of anxiety, a sound that's become far too familiar these past few days. The meds help, or are supposed to, but lately it's like trying to quell a forest fire with a garden hose.

I initiated the ruse this morning. The Bulletin Board System, bless its digital heart, allowed me to reach Soror XI with some carefully crafted prose. I framed my message as a desperate plea, a confession of impending mental collapse. \[Three-week sabbatical,\] I typed, my fingers clicking against the keyboard in a nervous rhythm. \[Need to…regroup. Reassess. My mind… it feels like a broken radio, tuning into too many frequencies at once.\] I threw in a few dramatic ellipses for good measure.

The truth, of course, is only partially there. Yes, I feel it, the familiar clawing at the edges of my sanity. But it's not the breakdown she imagines, at least not yet. It's the sheer weight of what I've been uncovering, the unnerving puzzle pieces that have been falling into place – or not falling into place – these past days. What I'm feeling is a pressing need to address the situation at hand.

Soror XI, bless her rigid, bureaucratic soul, bought it hook, line, and sinker. She responded immediately, her message a flurry of concern wrapped in her typical clipped tone. \[Jim,\] she wrote. \[Your request is approved. We will air re-runs of your broadcast to maintain the schedule. Focus on your well-being. Really. This time off will do you a world of good.\] That last part was almost gentle, which, coming from her, is practically a hug. A hug that made me feel like a scoundrel for lying- for using my mental illness to manipulate. But I needed this, needed the freedom to move without scrutiny. She's probably relieved, I think, that I seem to have finally dropped the line of questioning pertaining to the previous Saturday's broadcast.

Leaving Scrimbus was like shedding a skin. I packed my faithful Datsun with the usual gear – camera, recording equipment, my expensive laptop with satellite link – and threw in a couple of weeks' worth of supplies. I drove east first, heading towards Anson. I needed to see Manny, needed to have a closer look at those photos that sparked the initial alarm when he called me at four in the damned morning.

The meeting with Manny at the gas station where we first met was brief and tense. He handed me the envelope containing the photos without a word, his eyes darting around like he expected someone to emerge from the shadows. The images were more disturbing up close, particularly the ones on I-35 right outside Waxahachie. The blurred, indistinct symbols, the unnatural distortion of light; all of it reinforced my belief that this was tied into the anomalies that wormed their way into my show. He also had another photo, one of the figure I had seen on my live broadcast, but this one was much clearer, with the distinctive red robes and pointy capriote as plain as could be.

The drive towards Waxahachie felt wrong somehow, a feeling that seemed to gather like static electricity around me. I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, the red-tinted lenses of my spectacles distorting the road and the sky into something vaguely sinister. I stopped at a truck stop in Thurber about halfway, the kind with greasy burgers and stale coffee. I needed to eat and get gas (Hah! Fart joke. Don't judge. I need to find amusement where I can.). The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a discordant harmony to the anxiety gnawing at my insides. I was just digging into my meal, having applied a generous amount of A1 sauce to my burger when a payphone on the wall next to the john began to ring.

It's for me again. I know it. I hesitated, a strange sense of dread prickling my skin. But the ringing persisted, insistent, and I found myself reaching for the receiver.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded tight, even to my own ears.

A frantic voice crackled on the other end, a voice I recognized immediately. ""Jim, it's Suzie! They're everywhere! NAORC, they're all over Santa Fe! They're like... like cockroaches, crawling all over the place! And... and... "" Her voice broke, a choked sob cutting through the static. ""This has never happened previously; they're everywhere!"" And then the line went dead. Previously, she said... like the unfolding events were a movie she'd seen many times before. Was she watching the director's cut this time?

I stood there, the phone receiver still pressed to my ear, the grease in my fries instantly congealed. New Mexico. NAORC. This wasn't some isolated incident; this was a coordinated movement, a deliberate breach, and Suzie had just confirmed what I feared all along: that this wasn't just about the 'Other' presence. It was something far bigger, something far more insidious. The NAORC were never this bold in the past, usually sticking to their cloak-and-dagger routine. They are tenuous allies to the EOTO, but their goals are, to say the least, sinister.

My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat a frantic drum against the rising tide of panic. I couldn't go to Waxahachie. Not now. I needed to see what was happening in Santa Fe. I needed to meet this mysterious Suzie. I slammed the receiver back into its cradle, my mind racing, calculating. I grabbed my things, my appetite suddenly gone. The greasy burger remained half-eaten on the table, a monument to my abruptly derailed plans.

I was back in the Rust Bucket within minutes, the engine roaring as I tore out of the parking lot, heading west. The road was a blur, the landscape flashing by in a dizzying rush. The anxiety was still there, but it was now laced with a cold, focused rage. My hand tightened around the steering wheel, the ouroboros ring on my right hand feeling like a burning brand. The EOTO had taken me in, given me purpose, and I'll be damned if all they've done for me has gone to waste, even if they secretly knew something was going down.

It was well past sunset when I crossed the state line. The sign read: ""Welcome to New Mexico, Land of Enchantment."" But there was no enchantment here, only a chilling sense of foreboding. As I drove onwards into the vast expanse of the New Mexico dark, I glanced in the rearview mirror. There, for just a fleeting second, was a glimpse of something that made my blood run cold; a red figure, robed and indistinct, standing at the edge of the darkness behind me, its very presence an echo of the chilling image from my broadcast. I could feel its gaze on me, and it sent a shiver down my spine. It could just be a trick of the dim lighting, or the exhaustion of the long drive. But I knew one thing, without a shadow of a doubt; I wasn't alone.

And whatever this 'thing' was, whatever its purpose, had followed me to New Mexico.",1,1736748022.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Hey Travel Trotters! 🧳

I've just returned from an epic journey, visiting 50 incredible countries around the globe, and I'm beyond excited to share some of the hidden gems I stumbled upon along the way. Whether you're a newbie explorer or a seasoned globetrotter, I've gathered some unique travel insights, practical tips, and cultural nuggets that will enrich your future adventures.

---

## Europe: Culinary Delights and Historical Marvels 🍷

**Italy's Secret Vineyards:**
While the Tuscan hills are world-renowned, have you explored Italy's lesser-known wine regions like Piedmont? The family-run vineyards offer intimate tours and tastings that are far less crowded.

**Tip:** Hire a local guide who can introduce you to exceptional, offbeat wineries. Their insider knowledge is invaluable for a personalized experience.

**Anecdote:** In Sicily, I was invited to a local family's Sunday lunch. I learned how to make pasta from scratch and shared stories over copious amounts of homemade limoncello. A true testament to the warmth of the Sicilian people!

---

## Asia: Spiritual Journeys and Vibrant Markets 🕌

**The Tranquil Backwaters of Kerala, India:**
Escape the chaos of India's urban centers by renting a houseboat. Drift through the serene backwaters and witness traditional village life, far removed from the tourist trails.

**Tip:** Visit in August during the Nehru Trophy Boat Race. It’s not just about the competition; it’s a cultural extravaganza!

**Relaxation Tip:** Try an authentic Ayurvedic massage. It's not just relaxing but also a deep dive into centuries-old Indian healing practices.

---

## South America: Natural Wonders and Rich Traditions 🦙

**Colombia’s Coffee Triangle:**
Most travelers hit the beaches of Cartagena but bypass the lush coffee plantations. Stay in a quaint finca (farm) and learn the art of coffee making from bean to cup.

**Tip:** Use Airbnb Experiences or local tours to find immersive two-day plantation tours for a complete deep dive.

**Must-Try:** Have a cup of freshly brewed coffee with a slice of homemade arequipe (dulce de leche) pie at a local café tucked amidst the plantations.

The semester ends in two weeks and I want us to go out before exam season begins. I am not sure what would be the proper way to ask him out without making him feel “emasculated”. Should I ask him for weekend plans when we’re alone and then set something up with him? Should I text him about it?
And what happens when we do go out if I ask him, do I plan the date/pick him up/pay? (I am used to guys asking me out, so I genuinely do not know what happens if I ask out a guy). 

I was thinking that I should set up a study date with him this week and then casually ask him if he wants to grab a coffee or just hang out when we’re done. But there’s a lot that can go not as planned with that.",1,1736747921.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Well, just calculating the hours which you spend in bed is not enough to tell. Sleep quality scales are tools that help you check how well you sleep each night.

The best tool many doctors use is called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, or PSQI. It's a kind of sleep checkup that looks at seven key parts of your sleep:

* How you feel about your sleep
* How fast you fall asleep
* How long do you sleep
* How much of your bedtime is real sleep time
* What wakes you up at night
* If you take a sleep medicine
* How sleepy you feel during the day

Here's something that may surprise you-lots of people believe that they sleep great just because they are in bed for 8 hours, but when they use these sleep tools to check, it turns out their sleep isn't as good as they thought. That is why checking sleep quality is just as important as counting sleep hours.

**Want to get better sleep scores? Here's what helps:**

Go to bed and get up at the same time every day Follow a soothing bedtime routine. Avoid using your phone and tablet at least an hour before going to bed Track when you drink coffee or tea Make your bedroom quiet and comfortable Write down any mid-night awakenings.  
The PSQI gives you a number from 0 to 21. The lower numbers mean you're sleeping better. If you get more than 5, you might want to work on your sleep. You can catch problems early and see if your new sleep habits are helping when you go through your sleep regularly with these tools.

Good sleep keeps your entire body healthy. Your brain functions more clearly, and you'll feel more alert through the daytime. Which do you think is a part of your sleep you would want to improve? Are there times you have noticed things that helped you sleep or things that kept you awake?

I thought I would share my experience. Note I only ever booked the basic/cheapest room. All breakfasts were included with Platinum Elite benefits. 

  
**Sydney - Pier one (Autograph)  1 night**

My partner and I stopped here as we had an international flight flying out the next day. The hotel is beautifully located, with a rustic nautical theme. The only dining we did here was the happy hour $2 oysters (a bargain). We enjoyed complimentary breakfast, and a room upgrade looking at the Sydney Harbour Bridge. 

No lounge

Rating - 9/10

**Bali - Renaissance Uluwatu 5 nights**

This is by far my favourite hotel in Bali (and easily top 3 in the world). I have stayed at this property close to a dozen times. I always get upgraded to a large suite at this property. The breakfast is also one of the best in the world. The staff couldn't be friendlier. The hotel is nice and quiet and off the beaten track a little, but only a short cab ride to surfing spots, restaurants, and other cultural activities. 

No lounge. 

Rating - 10/10

**Dubai - Westin Mina Seyahi 3 nights**

I tried my luck with 3 of my NUA and was stoked to see the confirmation come through a few days prior to an Club Suite Ocean View. After reading so many posts about NUA being rejected, I didnt have much hope, especially mid December. This hotel is beautiful. The lounge is exceptional and if you didnt want to dine anywhere else, you technically could have all meals here. The breakfast is extensive and probably tops the Renaissance Uluwatu - but not by much. The location is close to public transport which is pretty easy to use. I wish it had been warmer so I could enjoy the pools and beach. Staff were very friendly and helpful. 

Lounge available

Rating - 10/10

**Vienna - Imperial Riding School (Autograph) 4 nights**

The first European hotel on my trip, and a sharp contrast to the three prior hotels. An upgrade to a ""church view"" was barely an upgrade, and the room was quite small, but we didnt really mind, we weren't spending much time in the room anyway. The location is great, and some nice restaurants close by. About 15 minute walk to some good sites to see as well. The breakfast was abysmal compared to the prior hotels, but gets the job done. Coffee was definitely a let down (a theme that will continue). Staff were mostly helpful. 

No lounge 

Rating - 7/10



**Montreux - Suisse Majestic (Autograph) 5 nights**

This hotel is stunningly beautiful, and wonderfully located by the Christmas markets and train station. The restaurant overlooks Lake Geneva for a wonderful view. Our room was upgraded to Lake view, however we swapped rooms with people we were travelling with as their room couldn't fit a rollaway bed. Our new room was slightly smaller facing the train station. The room itself is nice, but dated. I am not sure if there is any other bed types in this hotel other than single beds. Our original Queen room was two singles pushed together, and the room we swapped to was two single beds which rolled the second you got in them. The hotel is expensive (although this is true for most places in Switzerland). The service from reception was great, but nothing special from the bar or restaurant. One frustrating thing with this hotel is the elevators - they are slow and small. No barista coffee for breakfast again - disappointing when you are paying such a top price. 

No lounge 

Rating 6.5/10. 

**Lyon - Marriott Cité Internationale 2 nights**

Certainly a more corporate hotel catering for business people, we used this hotel for a short stopover on our way to Paris. This is about as corporate as you get. The room was a good size, but we had issues with the hot water which we only worked out after unpacking. It wasn't worth the trouble to change rooms at this point. The breakfast was fine, but again, nothing special. The location of the hotel is close to public transport and a beautiful park across. The service was adequate - nothing special. 

No lounge

Rating 7/10. 

**Paris - Rive Guache Marriott 4 nights** 

I had booked this hotel as it was the only reasonably priced hotel over New Years Eve. Every other Marriott property was at least $700AUD+ per night. The location of this hotel is quite good with both metro and train stops close by. The hotel was renovating their restaurant (I think?) and breakfast was served on one of the conference levels. This was probably the most average breakfast of the trip. I put this down to it not being served in the restaurant, however there was no notice of this until the first morning - the check in agent didnt even advise us. We were upgraded to a high floor. We didnt visit the lounge at this property. 

Lounge available

Rating 6.5/10

**London - County Hall Marriott 4 nights**

I had been looking forward to this hotel the most. You could not pick a better location. We were kindly upgraded to a Thames/Westminster view. and the room was spacious and modern. The lounge at this hotel was nice, with evening canapes doing the trick after a large lunch. The breakfast in the M club was great and the view (which many have posted) is idyllic. The service by the staff was exceptional. I could not fault this property one bit. 

Lounge available

Rating 10/10

**London - Airport Marriott.** 

We stayed here one night before an early morning flight. When we arrived there was a long queue due to the internet being out. The staff were doing everything they could do ensure guests were comfortable, handing out complimentary beverages whilst waiting. We quickly visited the lounge for a quick bite - the food was fine, nothing special. We were leaving the hotel quite early and the Manager on duty said he would organise a boxed breakfast for us on departure. There is a convenient airport shuttle booking system located in the hotel. The room was fine, nothing special - not that you really need it. 

Lounge available

Rating 8/10 (for an airport hotel). 

**Tokyo - Mesm Hotel (Autograph)** 

Our flight home from London connected through Tokyo and we spent 36 hours here. The Mesm hotel is perfectly situated a short walk from the monorail that departs Haneda airport. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30am not expecting to have a room ready, however the check in agent advised us a room would be ready by 10am. We were very grateful. The views from the hotel lobby are magnificent. The staff were exceptionally friendly. The room was large and modern. Breakfast was also quite good and I finally had a great coffee after about 3 weeks of average coffees. I didnt get a chance to visit the bar, or gym, so assuming those amenities are also top quality, I will be inclined to also give this hotel a 10/10 rating. 

No lounge 

Rating - 10/10

They also didn’t tell me to not drink my cup of coffee per day.

I’d say I eat pretty healthy, rarely drink alcohol, exercise regularly. With my numbers, do you think I should take supplements and cut coffee for a certain period before I do egg freezing or do it as early as possible?",2,1736747283.0,eggfreezing,0,1.0,False

But after some reading I realised there was much better value in getting a good grinder and a used and/or cheap but decent espresso machine. For instance, a mid-range Breville costs a whole of a lot more than my current setup, which consists of a $200 machine and a $400 grinder. 

When you compare it like that it's hardly a contest, you're getting better espresso for less money. 

But soon, if it's not already happening, these machines will probably start getting a bit better, especially in the grinding department.

Colmar, a charming town nestled in the Alsace region of France, is a fairytale brought to life.  But what truly sets it apart, what makes it instantly recognizable and utterly enchanting, are its half-timbered houses. These architectural gems are more than just buildings; they're a living testament to history, craftsmanship, and the unique Alsatian spirit.  Ready to explore?

**What are Half-Timbered Houses?**

Before we delve into Colmar's stunning examples, let's understand what makes these houses so special.  Half-timbered houses, or *pan de bois* in French, are a type of construction where a wooden frame is exposed externally, with the gaps filled with brick, stone, or wattle and daub (a mixture of mud, straw, and clay). This creates a striking visual effect, with the intricate wooden beams forming geometric patterns and showcasing the builder's artistry.

**Colmar's Half-Timbered Heart:**

Colmar's old town is a veritable museum of half-timbered architecture.  Every corner reveals a new surprise, from grand, multi-story buildings to smaller, more intimate houses.  The vibrant colours – often deep reds, yellows, and greens – further enhance their whimsical charm.  Walking through the streets feels like stepping into a postcard, a scene straight out of a children's book.

**Must-See Spots for Half-Timbered House Enthusiasts:**

* **Little Venice (Petite Venise):**  This picturesque canal-side area is arguably Colmar's most famous spot.  The colourful half-timbered houses lining the canals are simply breathtaking, especially when reflected in the water.  A boat tour is a wonderful way to appreciate them fully.

* **Rue des Têtes (Street of Heads):** This street is named for the numerous sculpted heads adorning the half-timbered houses.  Each head is unique, adding an element of mystery and intrigue.  Unraveling their stories is half the fun!

* **Koïfhus:** This former customs house, a magnificent example of half-timbered architecture, stands proudly near the town's main square.  Its impressive size and intricate detailing make it a true highlight.

* **Old Town Square (Place de la Cathédrale):** While not exclusively half-timbered, this square boasts several stunning examples of these houses, providing a great central point for your exploration.

**Beyond the Pictures:**

While photographs capture the beauty of Colmar's half-timbered houses, experiencing them firsthand is truly unforgettable.  Take your time to wander the streets, admire the details, and imagine the lives lived within these historic walls.  Perhaps grab a coffee at a charming café and simply soak in the atmosphere.

**Tips for your visit:**

* **Best time to visit:** Spring and autumn offer pleasant weather and fewer crowds.
* **Getting there:** Colmar is easily accessible by train from major French cities.
* **Accommodation:**  Choose accommodation in the old town for an immersive experience.

Colmar's half-timbered houses are more than just a pretty sight; they're a window into history, a symbol of Alsatian heritage, and a guaranteed source of wonder and delight. So, pack your bags, book your tickets, and prepare to be enchanted by this unforgettable destination. You won't regret it!

I’m going to share my experience with my recent kidney stone removal (laparoscopic) and double J tube removal. This is to provide an insight as to what to expect during the entire course. I just wanted to note that your experience might be a bit different to mine. I have included tips which I’ve learned to make it easier.

Nothing to talk during surgery as you will be under a general anesthesia and will wake up in the recovery room.

DAY OF SURGERY
-The moment I woke up, I am not in any pain; however, my bladder felt very full and burning, even though it was emptied. This is due to the trauma from instruments during the procedure.
-They gave me an anti-inflammatory medication (intramuscularly) to relieve some of the swelling and offered me a pain medication orally.
-After an hour or two in the recovery room, I was allowed to go home. Make sure you have a driver or set-up and transport service.
-1 to 3 days post-op, urinating burns, a lot. You would also feel a discomfort on your lower back and/or below your belly (completely NORMAL- this is due to the double J coil tube ‘touching’ your somewhat sensitive kidney, ureter and bladder. The burning sensation/almost sharp discomfort during urination disappears after inflammation subsides; however, discomfort on your back and lower belly stays for weeks (not bad, very tolerable).
**Bleeding- it is normal to have some blood on your urine, especially during activities, even as simple as long walks such as grocery shopping. The bleed is more on the first few days and slowly lightens . Just a note that the pink/ dark brown urine might stay whilst you have the double J tube.
**Mild pain/discomfort- Increased with activities and might occur early AM as the tube might be ‘leaning’ on one spot while you sleep. I would say the pain for me is between 2-3 out of 10 during light activities. Mostly doesn’t need pain meds (You might need over the counter pain medication on the first few days- talk to your MD).

Tips:
1. HYDRATION!!! helps a lot. I could not emphasize this more. The pain is somewhat lesser and bleeding is less and it keeps your urinary system ‘moist’ for a lack of word. I drink 2.5-3 liters/day and I keep track.
2. I minimize my coffee/hot choco. Less sodium and red meat. I also avoided pops/soft drinks.
3. Medication- I only have 2;  Pain medication as needed and Tamsulosin (relaxes your ureter and bladder- lessens the need for pain meds and facilitates the removal of broken down stones and clots).
4. Hydration, Again!! Very important. You would notice the difference, I did.
5. Take some time off if possible- I am a nurse; however, working as a case manager. Although I spend a lot time on a desk, I’m still required to see my patients and so a lot of walking. I took a week off- rest as much as possible to aid recovery and minimize irritation.
6. Hydration…. AGAIN!!

Double J removal- Mine stayed for 4 weeks. Removed at the doctor’s clinic- some have strings which can be removed at home.
-Do not stress about it.
-From the time I sat on the bed with stirrups, it took the doctor around less than 2 minutes to remove.. Literally.
-They prep you—>disinfects the area —> They put jelly with lidocaine (it burns for about 5 seconds and then numbs your urethra) —> Doc inserts the instrument —> infuses your bladder with a solution to increase visibility (you would feel a pressure and I REALLY need to pee sensation —> Doctors ‘grasps’ the tube and then pulls it out (weirdest feeling ever).
Question:
1. Was it painful- NO; however, there were times with extreme discomfort (last 1-5 seconds) during insertion, infusion of fluid and removal of tube.
2. Was it worth stressing out- No! No! No! It’s over before you know it.

Post removal-
1. So far it burns a lot when I pee (3 hours had past since the removal)
2. Felt a lot better without the feeling of the tube inside (mentally and physically).
3. Some dribbling after urination.
4. With minor bleeding, cleared after 1-2 urination.
5. 4 days post removal update- It went back to normal 24 hours or less after removal. I have seen a lot, I mean a lot of stone came out after. I added a picture on some of them.

I realize that we both have lives outside of our affair, but I’d like a certain level of communication and attention, and I can’t say I’m getting it. To be fair, when we are together, he is attentive, and makes me feel amazing, both physically and emotionally. We are sexually compatible, I am extremely attracted to him, and we have a great time together. We meet at least once a week. Generally for coffee/lunch. Sexual encounters are once, or very occasionally, twice a month. We have taken weekends together, as well, over the course of our relationship.  

However, when we aren’t together, I feel like I’m always trying to figure out where I stand. Which, for me, is ridiculous. I’ve never stressed about relationships. We talk via text only, no phone calls, which I have recently realized I’m not a fan of. I have not communicated this to him. He tends to initiate contact on weekday mornings, for the most part, and will send few, low effort responses during the day, and generally leaves me on “read” after 2-3pm.  Very little contact on weekends, but only because I initiate contact. I’m getting frustrated with it, and am considering looking elsewhere for affection. I’m already lacking it at home, why deal with it in my extracurriculars? 

So my question is, am I expecting too much? Occasional phone calls, text responses, some light chatting during the day, a goodnight or some acknowledgment in the evening? We are both early/mid forties, so we are busy and have jobs, but neither of us have small kids, or things that would prevent any of those things that seem to be very minor time commitments.

I got a CT scan done, which all appeared to be normal except mild constipation. I don’t have a UTI—I’ve been tested for it three times. My blood work came back normal, and I saw a urologist who did a sonogram, but nothing unusual showed up.

I’ve been eating fiber, drinking water, and trying to exercise, but it’s hard to maintain a normal routine because of the frequent urination. I am only able to drink about 40-60 oz of water now instead of the full gallon. I really feel like my hormones are off, and I’d like to get further tests done. I’m just not sure which doctor to see next or what steps to take. Most of the specialists I’ve seen have been pretty dismissive.

1i072fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1i072fe/huel_hs_pots_still_rock_keurig_update_flavor/,Huel H&S pots still rock! Keurig update + flavor descriptions/ratings,"Ever since I discovered that my Korean BBQ Huel H&S was objectively better when made with a Keurig single serve coffee maker and subsequently went on a drunk rant about it in the sub on New Year’s Eve (you’re welcome btw), I decided that I’d try out all of the flavors using this method and record my findings, to see if my observations held true across the product line. 

Now that my little project is done, I’d like to share my findings —completely sober and only a little unhinged. If you want the TL;DR well then yeah, using a Keurig at the 6oz setting works and the flavors are generally agreeable (Cajun pasta needs improvement). You may now exit the post and continue scrolling elsewhere. 

However if you want the deets, well then LOCK IN cuz we’s takin’ the long way home. 



First off, I had to buy a Keurig to do my experiments at home —no time for science projects at work, that’s the rub. I bought the bougie “K-Supreme Plus® Single Serve Coffee Maker”, partly for the increased potential for customization but mostly because I wanted it to match the other stainless steel appliances on my countertop (they do make a pretty slick set if I do say so myself). For further reference, my workplace has the “Keurig® K-Elite® Single Serve Coffee Maker” —which is also the most common model I’ve personally seen elsewhere out in the wild. For whatever reason on this ‘elite’ model, Keurig made the big brain ‘elite’ decision to use a miscellaneous set of pictures of teacups and coffee mugs for their different volume setting buttons instead of just directly stating how many ounces each button pours (In case you also find this confusing, the settings are 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 oz).

As far as actually using the Keurig, the first step is to open it to make sure there’s not already a previously used k-pod still in the machine. If there is, then throw out the old k-pod (while mumbling obscenities about your coworker Vincent, who never clears the Keurig when he’s done with it).  Depending on the model, it may be a good idea to run the Keurig blank to flush out any coffee grounds residue (my new bougie Keurig has this problem but the regular workplace one doesn’t).



And now without further ado, let’s brew some lunch. 



**Chick’n & Mushroom Pasta**

I’ve had this one before in the old multi serve pouches and generally found this flavor as the best of all available at the time. It used to be a penne pasta so the first thing I noticed when opening the packaging was that the pasta changed to smaller swirly bits. 

First up, I went with the recommended 6 oz (3/4 cup) and 5 minutes of wait time. The 5 minutes of sit time isn’t enough (which is true for all of the flavors using a Keurig) and this one it needs the longest sit time of them all at more like 12 minutes (the others are fine after about 8 minutes). Even then, its consistency is more runny than it looks in the advertising. I tried it again at the 4oz setting but then it was crunchy and too thick. For my kettle bros, consider using 5oz. But for those of you also fixed on the “press button, get lunch” concept, just use the recommended 6oz and wait a couple extra minutes.  I saw another user recently make their H&S in a thermos to allow longer sit time without the meal going cold, which would work out great for this flavor in particular, especially if using the sachets instead of the pots (this flavor comes in both packagings).  

The flavor itself reminds me of stroganoff, specifically the Americanized boxed Hamburger Helper version. The base flavor is a cream-of-mushroom body with chicken bullion. Secondary flavor is black pepper and the tertiary flavor is chives and thyme —which are only really noticeable as a mildly pleasant aftertaste. There’s enough salt in here that I don’t notice its absence but not enough that I’d consider the meal particularly salty; it’s appropriate for the rest of the flavors here. There is also no weird chemical or additive taste. 

No recommendations for overall flavor improvement but if you really wanted the mouthfeel to be like biting into my childhood, change the pasta style to truncated lasagna strips. 

  
Taste: 4.5/5

Keurig Settings: 6 oz

Wait time: 10-12 minutes 

  


**Cajun Pasta**

I’ve had this one before too. It’s bad. In the past, “it’s bad” was about as much thought as I’d given the product before dropping the whole bag into the trash can and moving on. But in the name of science, I went at it again and this time put in some more effort into my observations.

The flavor tastes like pea protein powder mixed with Old Bay seasoning. It’s almost kind of like a sad neutered version of jambalaya and thinking of it like this makes the lack of seafood and/or sausage flavors glaringly obvious (which is no doubt why they didn’t just name it that). The flavor is passable but not good. The mouthfeel, however, is much better as pasta than it would have been with rice because if you use your imagination a little, then the pasta mouthfeel is similar to that of crawfish (which to be clear, gross me out. A vegetarian version of those little fuckers is an improvement in my book).

I’ll give this one a 3/5 for flavor, so I’d eat it if it was given to me but I wouldn’t look forward to it. For reference, I’m generally not a picky eater and have lower taste requirements than the average Joe because I’m mostly here for the science + convenience. However at $5 a pop, any product below a 4/5 is likely unacceptable to the average working American (and I guess I should add that even my subjective 5/5 isn’t on par with ‘the best thing I’ve ever eaten’ and is instead ‘the best/tastiest nutritionally complete meal that can be reasonably achieved from this format and at this price point’). 

So anyways, 3/5 this flavor is SUBPAR (in my not-so-humble opinion) unless improved. The main problem is that the mostly neutral but faintly earthy ‘pea protein + nutrient wonderbled’ flavor is front and center when it should be invisible. Also, what’s missing here are the seafood + sausage flavors of more traditional jambalaya or a seafood boil. 

To my taste, there’s a near immediately obvious solution (which I later tried irl for proof of concept and does indeed work, up to 4.5+/5). Wanna know what crawfish tastes like? Earthy shrimp. So add in some shrimp bouillon (which makes use of the otherwise wasted shell of shrimp but not the flesh —so still vegetarian but not vegan) along with some vegan bacon bits and you’d kill 2 birds with one stone. This would both hide the out-of-place flavor better and give a more robust flavor base for the Old Bay seasoning to subsequently enhance. Add in a bit more cayenne pepper tho so that the new flavors don’t take away from that last little kick of pizazz at the tail end of the flavor profile —preferably from the classic original Louisiana Hot Sauce to both add in a bit of acidity and thematically stick the landing.  If you want to go the extra mile and fully commit to the whole ‘seafood boil’ aesthetic, consider swapping the wheat based pasta for a potato based pasta like gnocchi.



Taste: 3/5. Add bacon bits, a pinch or two of shrimp bouillon, and more cayenne pepper (hot sauce).

**Spicy Gochujang Noodles**

This write up is both a relief and a bummer cuz I originally did a much longer write up on an old batch of the spicy g-noodle cups. I’ll spare you the details (tho you can assume it was witty, well-considered, and involved a g-sauce fueled adventure to a local Korean restaurant) but I didn’t like it. I gave it a substandard 3.5/5 and felt that the fermented spicy tofu noodles ultimately needed a pork flavor, some sweetener, and pickled cucumbers. 

However, when I got my new batch of pots, the g-noods were new and improved (or maybe just not expired lol). There was a sweet tang added to the spicy-ness that I felt checked off my ‘add sweetener’ box and gave a satisfactory alternative for my ‘needs pork’ box. Updated taste rating is 4/5, tho I still think the product could be improved with some freeze dried pickled cucumber chunks.  



Taste: 4/5.

**Japanese Curry**

This one is fine I guess. There’s nothing distinctly wrong with the flavor, but it is a bit underwhelming at first. It’s like going to the best sushi restaurant in your town but then ordering off the ‘entree’ section of the menu instead of the ‘sushi’ section —it’s exactly what you ordered but somehow not what you wanted.

I don’t particularly enjoy curry on a personal basis (do we really need FOUR curry flavors btw??) but objectively, it tastes is good. The flavor profile is full bodied but unapologetically simple: a mellow yellow curry with some vegetable accents and a pleasant lingering tangy aftertaste. Humble, but what it lacks in oomph, it makes up for in comfort. The mouthfeel is good too, it doesn’t feel like eating dehydrated instant noodles; it just feels like eating food. 

By the end of our fictional restaurant meal, you are no longer jealous of your friends who ordered sushi and are instead perfectly content with your Japanese moon curry —a dish name which is entirely made up but feels right for this flavor. Generally when i hear ‘Japanese food’, my flavor expectations immediately goes to raw salmon, soy sauce, and wasabi. So when I first heard of a ‘Japanese Curry’ flavor, I was kind of just like “huh, curry and soy sauce? Not sure how ur gonna pull that off but I guess I’ll try it”.  To be fair, I don’t have weeb level knowledge of Japanese cuisine (I’d never heard of ‘Katsu’ before reading the product description) so my expectations were probably misplaced but I’d wager that I’m not too far off from the average American. Adding some sort of modifier between ‘Japanese’ and ‘curry’ (‘moon’ or otherwise) would help to better manage those expectations imo.

**Szechuan Spiced Noodles**

This one is actually quite similar to the Spicy Gochujang Noodles. It’s to the point that on initial tasting, I had to recheck the label to make sure I’d made the right pot. I then immediately decided to taste them both side-by-side and the differences became more apparent. They both have a paprika flavor base with a bit of sweetness and some tang. The main difference is that the g-noods have a secondary Asian sweet-n-sour sort of taste and these z-noods instead have a secondary flavor of chives, onion, and a hint of black pepper. 

I much prefer these z-noodles and although it could be improved with some dehydrated green beans, the flavor profile feels complete without them. I do, however, regret tasting them side-by-side tho cuz now all I can think about is how the (otherwise fine) g-noods taste like how I imagine the z-noods would taste like if they expired and went bad. 



Taste: 4.5/5

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  


**Thai Noodles**

The flavor here is different, but neither in a distinctly good nor bad way. I had a difficult time trying to decide if I liked it or not and had eaten the whole pot before I’d come to a conclusion, which I guess is conclusion enough for me. There’s an immediate sharp sweet soy flavor to the front of the flavor profile and then the initial flavor backs off to unveil a middling flavor of peanuts, garlic, and onion. Finally, the flavor abruptly ends and there is little to no aftertaste. There’s something missing here tho and I couldn’t put my finger on it at first. 

To help me figure it out, I walked over to the Thai restaurant down the street and ordered some take-out Pad Thai to compare. When tasting the real thing side-by-side with the Huel analog, I think that Huel has done a pretty good job —at least considering that the Huel product is constrained to being ‘nutritionally complete’ (and vegan, unfortunately). My real Pad Thai had a similar overall taste experience except the soy flavor is dialed back and the sweetness picks up in the middle of the flavor profile (instead of right in the front) along with a more salient peanut flavor which lingers into the aftertaste. However, the real pad Thai also had a bit of scrambled eggs mixed in and this is where a lot of the ‘savory’ came from. The real thing also had bean sprouts which help create a more interesting texture but don’t have much impact on taste. 

Notwithstanding, I still give this Huel flavor a 4.25/5 cuz I do like it (more than the j or g-noods but less than the Ckn&Mshrm or z-noods). That said, this flavor has the potential for 5/5 with some adjustments: dial back the soy sauce flavor and add in a vegetarian/vegan alt for scrambles eggs, such as JUST Egg (or just actual egg if I were to have my way). Some dehydrated bean sprouts would be appreciated too but aren’t strictly necessary.   


Taste: 4.25/5

Keurig Settings: 6 oz 

Wait time: 8-10 minutes 

  
  


Aaaand that’s it. That’s the post. I almost wanted to launch into new flavor requests for H&S and also for the (probably not) forthcoming Huel chips/‘crisps’ (a theoretical product I’d thought up and mentioned at the end of my previous rant). But this post is already too long and I’ve completed what I’d set out to do. So thanks for your time, have a good day, and whatever you do, don’t try tasting the g and z-noodles together.

My gf and I have been dating for 6 months now and I’m just not sure if she even likes me sometimes. 

    My gf is 19 and I’m 22, we met when she was only 1 month out of a relationship but waiting another 3 before calling it official. 

     She’s a wonderful gal who makes me laugh and smile lots, but I’ve had some qualms that I’d like to hear your thoughts on. 


      My gf constantly reminds me that she loves me when we’re in person and is a great person when we’re together. But when we’re not it seems like I don’t exist sometimes. I never expect her to make me a priority or put her life on pause for me. One thing that unfortunately bothers me is sometimes when I text her, I’ll respond to her within 5 minutes but with her I’m lucky for her to respond within the hour. Usually 1.5-2 hours even for a like on a message. 

    She’s constantly active on her phone but it seems she has a difficulty reaching out. She’s explained to me that she needs time and space sometimes and that it’s hard for her to respond to texts. 


     Mind you, she works 3 days a week and has no license. I work 60 hours weeks and frequently pick her up from work and drive her around to where she need to go. Sometimes I feel used but I tell myself I’m not. 


    Everytime we go out to eat or do anything at all, typically she doesn’t mention to help with the bill and that’s fine with me, I like to treat her. However when she occasionally offers to treat me to a coffee or something, we often show up and she “forgets” that she wanted to do so (atleast 6 times now) and I end up paying. 

     It just feels like it’s really one sided and I’m getting tired. I make plans, I pay for her, I buy her flowers every 2 weeks, I drive her every where, and I don’t ever get anything in return. I’m not trying to sound self centred but I truly feel sometimes she just has me on a back burner or that I’m a parent. 

     She has a very short temper with me. She often gets very overwhelmed and I do nothing but to try to help her (we’ve talked about it and I understand her needs) but even then she’ll break out in frustration and anger with me over really simple things. I try to always show her love and tell her that it’s okay, I’m always here for here even after she tells me I’m of no help and that she’s mad. 

     I don’t really know where I’m going with this but I’m frustrated. I’m very much a home body who prioritizes her and would drop anything to sleep over with her but she has no problem dropping our plans to hang out with a friend or go out to the club in nothing more than a mesh shirt and a bra. 

     I know this post makes me sound really bad, but please let me know your thoughts. 


     Some days I just feel more like a parent to her than her boyfriend. I’m someone that struggles to let others go/ break up so that’s why I’m here. 

    Maybe I rushed her into the relationship but I’m not sure, some days she seems to act like she rather be single but maybe that’s my bias as of this writing. 

If any more context is needed please reply and I will do my best to do so.

Advice and personal experience. 1 week post op. ,"I was so anxious before the surgery. I thought about cancelling it many times and putting up with my chronic sore throats and tonsil stones for the rest of my life because I was so scared of the pain, and discomfort I would feel after surgery. However with much support, I decided on the one big sore throat to hopefully put an end to some of the relentless issues Ive had with my tonsils. It’s been about a week post op, and I think I’m through the thick of it!!! Here are some of my thoughts and advice to all you anxious folk who could use some reassuring. I know it can vary per person, this is just my experience. Hopefully yours goes just as well. 

- first two days were a breeze. I thought I could go back to work lol. KEEP ON THE MEDS anyways. It will hit you the third or fourth day. 

- cold water made the ear pain worse. Sipping on WARM TEA was much more soothing, and loosens everything up instead of stiffening the muscles. 

- SOFT, BLAND, foods are the best. I’m talking ramen with no seasoning packet (or just a quarter of it) eggs with no salt, pancakes with no syrup, or just a little honey or butter. My saving grace for getting some protein quickly was instant mashed potatoes with powdered protein bone broth from Costco. I could make two meals from a packet each. It was a little on the more flavorful and salty side which was a bit irritating on the throat, so you could put a lower sodium content broth in, but it was a fulfilling dinner and loaded with flavor and nutrients. If you’re low on energy/ don’t have an extra hand, scrambled eggs in the microwave, as well as pancake batter in a bowl in the microwave saves you a dish and some time. My husband is so sweet and discovered both of those hacks. Wish I had known them in art school haha. 

- ice packs with an elastic band like for wisdom teeth healing helped to numb the pain externally. 

- I tried all the combinations of ibuprofen, Tylenol and OxyCodone dosing and intervals under the sun. The most effective for me was 2 Tylenol, 3 ibuprofen at the SAME TIME, 6 hours apart, with oxy in between doses, 6 hours apart. (Ty/IB at 12 and 6, and Oxy and 3 and 9.) on the worst days for pain, I took the Tylenol and ibuprofen 4 hours apart. Which may be excessive but it really saved me. I tried taking the meds two hours apart, alternating each one per interval but found it most effective to take the ib and ty at the same time!! 

- Oh and for constipation, still figuring that one out lol. but coffee (latte or with cream so it’s less acidic) pears, sweet potato, peas, cucumber, all help to get things loose and moving. I watched some youtube videos about gentle stomach massages to loosen your bowels and they were super effective and easy to practice lying down. 

Hope this helps. Good luck!!!! You can do it! It’s worth it!!!!! ",3,1736746000.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

I have tried the method using blueing but it’s too difficult to bottle and take to schools, as well as being expensive. 

I am currently trialing different methods using urea but I have the same issue with it being hard to bottle for transport, as it needs to be a supersaturated solution and will crystallise if cooled. 

Any ideas into a cheap, easily accessible recipe that I can prepare the solution in advance and bottle it to let the kids add themselves? Doesn’t have to be taste safe but obviously not overly dangerous as children aged around 7-9 will be using it.

Great for the guys who love vanilla, bad for me.

So then, I tested Azzaro Chrome, Azzaro The Most Wanted EDP Intense, and Azzaro the Most Wanted Parfum.

TMWP and TMW Intense smells SO similar at the start, 15 minutes later TMWP smells VERY sweet and almost overly sweet. It gave me a headache, but somehow got me compliments? Not from men tho, only women.

TMW EDP Intense dry down was very through and through, it smelled the same from start to end and it was AMAZING. It somehow smelt citrus and like a warm cup of coffee handed to you with whip cream and toffee.

It'd be amazing for night time evenings, whether its summer evenings (cooler nights) or winter nights. 
 I also got compliments from both men and women on this and my friend (a guy) loves it and says that it maintains masculinity while being very welcoming.

Almost forgot about azzaro chrome... this thing just straight up smells like body odor and mouthwash trying to cover it.

He was a (28m), and Seth seemed nice at first. he was very charismatic and fun. In his bio, he seemed genuine, and we talked for no more than 2 days. He wanted to talk on the phone. Now I am an introvert, and I have phone anxiety; So I have to psych myself up to talk on the phone. It sucks. Still, I pushed through and called him, and I was excited. A tiny backstory: I was in a relationship with the same man for 6 years he was my only BF before this, so I never really dated, so this was new for me.  So we started talking on the phone, and it was good until the road rage started; He started yelling and honking his horn, telling them to move and that they were being ""candy asses"" he said since his brother was gay, he could say that; These were his words, not mine. I mean, I can't talk. I have road rage, but not as bad as that, and I am an ally. I would never say that I was uncomfortable after this, but I let it slide. The week passed of texting back and forth, and we decided to have another phone call. it started well until he started yelling at a football game he was watching. at this point, it was starting to get annoying, but I ignored it like the red flag wasn't flying high already. At this point, he asked me on a date at his HOUSE, and I said no, not meeting at your house on the first date. I watch 48-hour mysteries and missing persons like hell no, so we settled on a Starbucks 10 minutes from his house and an hour and a half away from me, and he also planned four dates after this one, so there are red flags number two and three already. Still, I go on this date, but I bring my mace and taser like my daddy told me to. Now as I am driving there and I am halfway there and he calls me like, damn chill, dude, I am on my way, but whatever. I get there, and I am ordering my drink. he walks up to me as I get ready to pay and pulls me into an awkward hug, but I let that slide. I go to pay, and he asks to pay for me, but I am one of those girls I can pay for myself; that way, he couldn't say, ""Hey, since I paid, I deserve something in return"" if you catch my drift and then he orders. We talked a little while waiting for our drinks and then went to a table outside the coffee shop. it was a pleasant conversation until he started talking about family plans. I put on my hinge profile I wanted kids and marriage; this was the whole reason I broke up with my Ex because he didn't want kids or marriage, so I'm thinking ok I guess I can deal with not having kids if I have to. Still, it was honestly a deal breaker if it couldn't at least be considered, and he said it was something to consider later. I agreed, and we went back to talking about other things, and this was when it got weird. He was adjusting himself, telling me when he is around pretty girls, he can't help that he gets turned on; then, he asked if I wanted to feel his legs because he works out, and then right after that, says after his last relationship, he isn't putting in more work then he needs to because his last girlfriend was crazy and if it was to work it needs to be equal work  and then He started talking about how he loves WWE and a character called stone-cold Steve Austin and proceeded to do the move that the character does when they are in the ring. The move consists of breaking beer cans over their head, and as it sprays everywhere, they stick their tongue out to catch some of it. Now we are in PUBLIC in a plaza-like area with multiple stores or restaurants, so there are so many people, and I am a nervous person who gets secondhand embarrassment for that person. So when someone does something cringy, I literally turn red and try to make myself smaller, but no, instead, this time, I can't be a normal person. I had taken a sip of my coffee right before and spit my drink out all over the table because I inhaled as I took that sip. It went up my nose, and I started profusely apologizing. As I did this, he was like ok with it, I go get napkins it is all good at this point, but then he did the same move three more times, so at this point, I was ready to go, and as I was trying to wrap this date up it gets weirder he asked if I wanted to sit in his car and if you asked me why I did this I honestly don't know why, but we sit in his back seat and he is like holding my hand and pulling it toward him, now he like rests it in his lap were I can see he is still very happy and he also wanted me to lean against his chest so I am weirded out and like I genuinely was about to run, but before I can he then lays his head on my chest and pulls my arms around him, and now I was stuck, and I tried like saying I need to get home and he like doesn't even acknowledge me saying this, but finally he sits up and says do you have to be somewhere and I said yeah my parent need my help at home at like 3:00 pm and he is like let me walk you to your car and I let him but he tried kissing me but I said I don't do that on the first date. He said he would text me details of the next date and that it is in the city we are in now because it is closest to him. After that, I drove straight home, and then, like two days after that, asked when we could have our next date, and I told him that was a bizarre date. He seemed nice, but I didn't think we would be compatible, and I hope he can find a more compatible girl. he blocked me, so was I the a\*\*hole? ",1,1736745221.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.67,False

I’ve been dealing with urticaria for almost two years now. Despite numerous blood tests, lab work, and skin tests, the exact cause of my flare-ups remains a mystery. I am allergic to several things now which before I don't really have, and while I suspect it all started after the COVID jab, who knows?

I can’t imagine what others have gone through, especially those who have suffered for a lifetime. But after many frustrations, journaling, tears, counseling, lab tests, and a lot of trial and error, here’s what has made me feel better over the past year:

1.  I started journaling everything—what I eat, my activities, even the weather. I noticed flare-ups often happened after cardio exercise or sun exposure.

2. I began gradually exposing myself to these triggers, like taking morning walks or jogs (around 7-8 AM). Yes, I would still get hives, but I managed it by taking Telfast 180mg afterward.

3.  Flare-ups were much worse when I panicked, especially if I saw a mosquito-like bite and spiraled into anxiety. Counseling helped me learn breathing techniques, which sometimes worked to calm my hives. On tougher days, I still relied on Telfast.

4. I realized that stress was a huge factor. Working from home and being inactive made things worse. I started easing back into walking, yoga, and running, which helped both my stress and symptoms.

5. I incorporated Sauna+Icebath into my routine, and they seemed to help reduce inflammation and calm my body.

6. I really really think HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy) have been a game changer for my urticaria to be honest. It might be worth exploring on your side. I tried it once and it reduced inflamations that I have, well I think it did.

7. I always carry Subalm with me. It's a lotion I use with a menthol-like effect and it has helps me relax and stop panicking when a flare-up begins.

8. Reducing my coffee intake and switching to tea seemed to have a positive effect as well.

I’m not a doctor, and I still keep Telfast and Subalm on hand just in case, but compared to before, my urticaria feels much more manageable. I hope some of these tips can help you too!

","Woke up nice and early. Well, early. (We all know why. (I don't appreciate your ageism. Well you're the one who survived this long 😆)) Slowly got my gear packed since my new friend wasn't stirring yet. I heard him puking last night. He doesn't have a tent yet. Just a sleeping bag and some blankets on top of a couple of trash bags to keep the mud from getting to his bedroll.

I unzip my tent, climb out, he looks over. ""Good morning sunshine!"" ""Dude. I've been puking and shitting all night."" ""Sounds like you've got food poisoning. I wonder what got ya. We've eaten the same food for a few days."" ""I don't know man, but I've been puking and running off into the woods all night."" ""That's fucking rough man.""

Gear out of tent. ""Are you taking all your stuff with you?"" ""Yeah. I don't know if I'm gonna take off today or not, and while I trust everybody here I want my stuff with me."" ""Cool.""

(We all know rule #1, right? Say it with me...)

He goes to talk to someone. Comes back. ""Do you have a cigarette?"" ""Yeah."" Pack out of pocket. Smoke out of pack while I answer. ""No, not for me. For -dude I haven't met yet-."" Smoke back in pack. ""Yeah, of course.""

""You say there's a cool coffee shop around here?"" ""Yeah, but I've only got about six bucks. Coffee is $2.29. I don't really wanna spend it on coffee. And it's out of our way."" 'Dude's gonna need smokes soon. He doesn't want to bum them from me. Gotta admire a guy for that. I'm the same way.' Begin to like dude even more.

""I got a few bucks. Some internet strangers (friends) have been very kind and generous to me, (Thank you very much!!! And damnit mods don't fucking ban me. The names are different out there and I don't know who they are here. Love ya!) (And LondonHomelessInfo...not today. I love you too!) I'll get you some coffee. Let's hit that gas station.

Both our gear packed. Out. Run into dude I haven't met yet.""Word on the streets is you need a cigarette."" For the look on his face and how sincere his thanks were, I wish I could bottle that stuff. He immediately offers us some instant coffee he's got.

I'm not gonna use up another homeless person's resources if I can get that thing on my own... Unless we're chilling and breaking out what we have so everybody can feel good for a bit. I will always offer what I can give to someone who asks. Unless you're a draining piece of shit who makes no effort to at least spread your needs around. Even then it's 50/50. Everybody has a rough time sometimes. And sometimes even the most fucked up of us just need something, or someone to listen to them and make them feel heard.
(Message!)

Drop my friend's gear near dude's tent. He told him he'd keep it out of the rain if it hits. Gas station. Coffee.  He tells me of his love of coffee and a cigarette  in the morning. ""On the boat I get up in the morning, do my dishes, make coffee, and have a cigarette or two. It's my favorite thing to do. Just sit there, tunes on, drinking coffee, and enjoying my morning."" ""Dude. That sounds sweet!"" ""It truly is. Even got a french press."" ""I love a french press.""

Stumble across brand new tiny wedge park. Gear down. Table. Smokes. Coffee. No bums. Living the dream for a few. Beautiful!

(It was so nice, I almost want to stop here. But I love you guys, so...)

Gear on. Off to a park he knows for a feed.

As we walk up a woman recognizes him, calls his name. She has missed being in the right spot to find him for a month. Still has a brand new daypack full of snacks and all kinds of goodies for him in her trunk. They chat. I slickly interject, ""He needs a tent."" No need to relay that conversation. He'll have a tent some time soon.

Him, ""You don't happen to be going through the tunnel after this do you. He needs a ride just to the other side."" Brothers helping brothers. Sunshine, rainbows, unicorns flying around... Negative. She's avoiding watching football with the hubs. No big deal. I'm never in a hurry.

Across park. In line. These peeps have got some good tunes playing. Every couple  minutes one of them is coming down the line handing us homemade fudge, slim jims, fresh baked brownies. 'Dude. These people are awesome!' One older guy even came down the line with a good word to say to every single person and offered a hug. Truly heart warming. Dude picked up on the fact I didn't want a hug, slowly reached out, gauging my reaction, gently touched me on the shoulder, said, ""Hey. How ya doing?"" 

Normally, I don't want you touching me. I'll be polite, but you can fuck off with that. You're invading my personal space uninvited, and I feel it's a low-grade attack. And it is. Regardless of your intention. My brain goes into 'what do I need to do to fend this off' mode. I won't act on it, but you're flirting with a violent wrath from someone who has nothing to lose, and is gonna change your life for the worse. 

This dude was so real and genuine to everybody I just rolled with it. I was truly touched by his sincerity.

Through line. Pizza, hot dog, chips or whatever you wanted, more homemade brownies-still warm, some bad ass red beans and rice (I've been an executive chef in three states), choice of gatorade, turn left, girl pouring coffee, ""Do you want cream and sugar? How about some whipped cream on top?"" Left again. Condiments. Thanking everybody as I go. 'Damn!' Pretty much at a loss for words feeling the love this morning. 

Across street to eat. No sense subjecting ourselves to any possible wingnut shit this morning. Nice, peaceful, delicious, meal. I've been craving pizza since the slice I mentioned a while back in Hattiesburg. Not enough to do anything about it, but it's been in my subconscious since then. Unless I'm buying some high dollar pizza -which pretty much never happens- I'm ordering papa johns. That's what's on my plate. Casually sipping another cup of good coffee, having another smoke. Peace, happiness, contentment. 

Library opens right then. Library. Phones charging. Reddit. Library closing soon. Gear on. Camp.

It starts to sprinkle. Friend goes to an established camp he has permisson to use while those peeps are gone for a couple days. I setup my tent at spot from last night as fast as I can without making too many mistakes. Time is of the essence!

Gear in tent. Tarp on tent. Me in tent. Rain hits hard. Bed layed out. Shoes off. Hoodie drying on backpack. Me in sleeping bag with recently acquired southwest style blanket. Perfect!

My hoodies dry. I can hang my solar powered tent light up 'cause I'm in the woods out of site. Solid peeps all around. A beautiful day! Thanks Alabama!!!

Author's note: 

I've never had much good to say about Alabama. It's always been a shitty hitchhike for me. Really long wait time. Worse than all but hitchhiking through Phoenix. Dated a girl from here. While I have nothing bad to say about her, it didn't go well, for a long time. (My fault as well as hers.) That's not really Alabama's fault but things add up over time.

After kinda getting stuck here for a few days, I've got to say, it's really showing me the love in a big way. I will always tell you guys the truth, regardless of how it makes me look. This place has been good to me. I feel it's a pretty enlightened place. There are some issues I've heard about, but I will not avoid it in the future. It has changed my mind.

My son 20M has been dating his girlfriend 19F on and off for 4 years starting in high school.  I have talked to the girlfriend’s Mom on occasion when she would drop her off at our house or at grad parties, nothing more.  The relationship in my opinion has been toxic and I don't think they are good for each other.  The break ups always came after she would get jealous if he talked to another girl (like a peer in a class in college) and she would get angry at him for not responding to her the way she wanted.  He would finally get fed up and break up with her.  The last break up was October 2024 and then in May 2024 they started talking again and wanted to get back together.  This break up was nasty, she said some of the most hateful things to him, things you don't say to someone that you supposedly love!  In May 2024 her mother called me, she left a nasty voice mail that I still have not listened too but my husband did. He suggested I didn't listen to it.   Fast forward to now, they did get back together in May.  I know he is an adult and can choose who he wants to be with.  We have talked with him and told him we support his decisions.  We may not always agree with them but we support him.  This is his life and we love him.  We are good! We have been very kind to the GF and have included her in our family stuff, dinners, holidays, weekend trips.  They have always gone well just a bit awkward as she doesn’t really talk to us much, but we keep trying because we love our son!  After this recent weekend trip away the GFs Mom texted me to meet for coffee. After everything that has happened, I really don’t want to meet with her.

For instance at work there's a girl who works adjacent in a pharmacy who over the last few months has come across and chatted to me. She's very sweet and genuine but there is zero attraction, might as well be a man. 

In a perfect world I would hitch up with her and call it a day, but I've tried dating someone I wasn't very attracted to (still more attracted than I am with her) and it was a bitter disappointment as I found out the soft way, physical attraction does not just magically appear as you get to know someone despite what reddit told me.

Anyway she asked me out to coffee the other day and I had to tell her as gently as possible that I wasn't interested in anything romantic, I blamed it on my own mental health and things going on behind the scenes so I wasn't in the right mindset for dating. 

But then I saw her profile pop up on hinge. If she sees me and sees that I'm active it's going to crush her a bit.

But what else am I to say? That I don't find her attractive? Surely that would crush her even more 

I always try to be polite and empathetic when I reject people but I still end up feeling bad about it. 

And of course, since the universe needs to get its kicks, the women who I'm most physically attracted to more often have much shittier personalities than the ones who are into me. 

I wouldn't date or even sleep with someone if I disliked them as a person, but still I need a fair amount of both physical and emotional attraction for a real romance to have any chance at working out.

When I was 13 years old, I lived in Kyiv, Ukraine. One day, I went to the local football stadium ""Temp,"" exercised a bit, and for some reason decided to climb to the top of the stands. The upper stands were fenced off with an iron barrier to prevent people from falling. I reached the top and noticed that one section of the fence had a hole in it. I didn’t pay much attention to it, turned my back to the fence, and started thinking about something. Then I stepped backward and suddenly realized I was falling backward. The fall lasted no more than 1.5 seconds from a height of about 5–6 meters (16–20 feet). I landed on the asphalt, stood up, and saw that nothing was broken. My bones and back were intact, though my left leg was slightly limping. I walked home, my back didn’t hurt, and the limp in my leg disappeared shortly after I arrived home. For the next two weeks, I kept wondering how I hadn’t broken anything from such a high fall and how I had survived at all.

**The Second Miracle**  
Perhaps you’ve already read about it on this forum. This is the story of how I was saved in Los Angeles and avoided the war in Ukraine. I arrived at Los Angeles Airport on February 12, 2022, passed through passport control, and headed to another terminal to continue my flight to Sacramento. At the terminal, I drank some coffee, then ran my hand over my jeans and noticed that my wallet was missing from the deep pocket. My phone was still there, but the wallet had disappeared. I was shocked—it had just vanished from my pocket. I reported it to the airport's lost-and-found service, but they found nothing. Ultimately, I flew to Sacramento without my wallet.

Around February 20, 2022, I received a message from the airport saying they had found my wallet. I then bought a return ticket to Kyiv, Ukraine, but included a stop in Los Angeles to retrieve my wallet. I flew from Sacramento to Los Angeles on February 22, 2022. Then, looking at my next flight to Istanbul, I was disappointed and frustrated—the next flight was only on February 23, 2022, at noon Los Angeles time, meaning I had a 14-hour delay. So, I booked an Airbnb for one night. On February 23, I flew from Los Angeles to Istanbul. When I landed in Istanbul, the war in Ukraine had already started. Essentially, that missing wallet in Los Angeles and the 14-hour delay because of it saved me from the war.",1,1736744439.0,Christianity,1,1.0,False

1i06iyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1i06iyk/i_think_my_boyfriend_is_dismissiveavoidant/,I think my boyfriend is dismissive-avoidant,"I (31, male) have been in a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend (36) for 4.5 years.  This is the longest relationship that either of us have been in.

If I’m not mistaken, I’m an anxious-preoccupied attachment style, and he’s dismissive-avoidant. We both work from home and live separately in the same city. We are both happy with this until we can afford a home. I record music for a living, so I’d definitely need some sort of basement studio to not disrupt him or feel self-conscious when I’m constantly singing or making noise. He comes over every Friday, and we spend time together at my place (I have a bigger & nicer place, I have trouble sleeping on his mattress, and he hasn’t ever insisted on me staying at his place, although I would if he did).

While he’s consistent and a stable rock in my life, our relationship has felt routine-based, and it’s hitting me more as time passes. He FaceTimes me every night, brings coffee when he visits, and we share some interests. He makes me laugh and playfully teases me (which I enjoy, and assume is his form of affection). However, he’s more of a “glass half empty” person and often shares strong political opinions that can feel mundane, though I usually agree with him. I understand that some interests I share with him aren’t his cup of tea either, but he tries to be involved (e.g. watching me play my favorite video game).

I’ve often felt that he lacks affection or genuine interest in me. He doesn’t ask about my life beyond what he already knows, and he doesn’t say “I love you” (claiming it’s not how he expresses love). He’s not romantic, and I’m the one who plans our activities. I’ve also shown him personal things like childhood photos, but he never asks to see them. I had a serious talk with him recently about how I feel like my needs aren’t being met. I was tearful, and he was quite silent, while saying things like “I hear you,” and admitting that a previous boyfriend of his felt similarly. He even told me that he was more affectionate at the start of our relationship because it was “new,” which didn’t sit well with me, and supported my suspicious of him being a dismissive avoidant.

Intimacy is also a challenge. I usually initiate, and it feels more functional passionate. One time, after we were intimate, he said, “I needed that,” which made me feel like it was a means to an end for him. I often communicate my feelings openly, but things don’t changed much.

I’ve had doubts throughout our relationship, especially because we’re so opposite, but I often wonder if those differences are actually what make us work and enjoy each other’s company. However, my doubts have intensified recently, and I’m starting to resent him. I notice his flaws more and wonder if I’m wasting my time. I’m an overthinker, and I fear I’ll always find something wrong with whoever I’m with. I also worry that I’ll regret leaving when I “wake up” and remember why I loved being with him.

Hey everyone!

I’ve always had a dream of owning a cozy little cafe or restaurant, and I think it might finally be time to go for it. The suburb I live in doesn’t really have any cafes like Barista or Java Lounge — just the usual spots serving fried rice, kottu, and some subpar biriyani.

There are quite a few middle to high-income folks around here, and surprisingly, shop rents aren’t too bad. You can get a spacious spot for about **20k per month**, which seems like a pretty good deal!

Here’s the vibe I’m going for:

* Cozy, earthy, and green aesthetics
* A menu with various coffee drinks, milkshakes, and high-quality pastries like cheesecakes and croissants
* Maybe even retailing high-quality local/foreign branded food items

I’m super excited, but I don’t know much about the regulations, licenses, or common pitfalls I might face. So I’d love advice from anyone with experience in running a cafe or restaurant. Also, suggestions from a customer’s point of view would be really helpful too!

Thanks so much in advance 😊

**TL;DR:**  
Thinking of starting a cozy cafe in a Sri Lankan suburb with good coffee and pastries. Shop rent is reasonable, attaching images for inspiration. Need advice on regulations, potential challenges, and general tips from both business owners and customers. Help a dreamer out!

  
I've attached some images to give you a better idea of the vibe I’m envisioning.

We barely know each other but I asked her out cuz I think she’s cute and we are both in med school and have the same schedule so figured we already have two things in common to start from. We’ve texted a few times and planning to meet for coffee Tuesday. 

Why do I feel a fear that it won’t work out? My previous relationship ended badly and it has been two years since I’ve been on a date; it’s easy to say “oh there’s your reason why you’re scared.” But I’m mentally strong enough to know that I just need to give it a chance, regardless if it does or does not work out. 

What can I do now to at least subdue this fear before the first date? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you ",0,1736743769.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

Here's my first 6 months of ""one-off"" expenses to help you plan","I hope this may be helpful to those of you trying to figure out how much they should expect to spend in that first year. I'm not really interested in judgy comments about how I spent too much on one thing or another, but feel free to ask questions if curious. Obviously everyone's expenses will look a little different.

Background: VHCOL, single income, coming out of a breakup so I had to buy a lot of basic household things. Home was 1,050 SF and move-in ready. Furniture expenses are high because I like nice things (solid wood, rugs of wool or other natural materials), furnished a second bedroom from scratch and went from nearly wall-to-wall carpet to wall-to-wall hardwood and tile.

Tl:dr, I spent roughly $18,000 on initial expenses in the first 6 months to help set up my home. There are also some purchases that most people wouldn't make, so I won't include those (a car, a digital piano, and some camping gear that had previously been shared with my ex).

* $572 movers
* $900 inspection (I waived inspection before closing, as is typical in this area - this was to develop a ""to-do"" list for the next 5-10 years)
* $1,188 initial water bill deposit (surprise!) They make you pay for what they expect four months to be upfront, and then refund it once you have established payment history
* $1,550 rugs
* $680 basic household things (e.g. utensils, garbage cans, bath mats, cleaning products, cleaning tools, etc)
* $5,800 furniture (some details below)
* $440 vacuum
* $2,900 termite treatment
* $48 random taskrabbit helper to move bed from one room to another
* $187 random amazon purchases categorized as one-off. Hmmm
* $225 tools
* $125 to have a contractor out to look at a plumbing issue. I will still have to pay to fix the issue. Otherwise, I have been lucky with repairs.
* $3,000 more than anticipated on my property tax bill (I will get this back) because the County hadn't updated its assessment of my home value by the payment deadline and was charging me based on the higher value this property sold for in 2021, plus three years of annual increases.

Furniture included a gorgeous new solid wood queen bed and mattress, night stand, a solid wood mid-century dresser and end table, some outdoor furniture (I have a sunny deck and yard), two bar stools, kitchen table and chairs. Other than the bed frame, mattress, and night stand, this was FB Marketplace.

I think the only other thing I wanted to mention is how my estimated monthly budget (for non-one-offs) differed from my expectations.

* Food: My monthly food expenditure was $800 not $500 (!). I know that sounds crazy. Believe it or not, I don't spend recklessly, usually bringing my lunch to work and seldom getting takeout at home. But I am an accomplished endurance athlete and eat a lot. This amount also includes coffee, alcohol, cleaning supplies - anything I'd buy at a grocery store.
* ""Random Shopping"" category is a bit high ($465 vs $400) partly because I'm trying to date and generally put any dating expenses in this category.
* Forgot to create a budget category for bike repairs, which is my primary mode of transportation.

My other categories are generally on target or lower than I had set out to spend.",5,1736743566.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,10,0.73,False

1i068ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i068ot/aita_for_being_disgusted_with_my_mother/,AITA for being disgusted with my mother?,"(At the begging I'm sorry for my bad English, I'm from Eastern Europe)

I (17F) took a break from studying and went to make myself a coffee to the kitchen. My mother was playing with my sister (14F), running after her playfully or something like that. My sister hid behind me. Then my mother approached me and for whatever reason grabbed my shirt and literally tore it from neck to waist. Since it was my favourite sleeping shirt I had nothing underneath it and she knew it. Not even mentioning that it was the shirt that I bought for myself with my own money earned at part time job, the shirt wasn't even that big of a problem. More the fact that she tore it in front of my sister and my dad as well. I was so shocked when It happened that I didn't even caught anyone's reaction, besides my mother who started laughing. I tried to cover myself and calmly told her that she shouldn't have done it and she told me ""you've done much worse things to me"" and I swear I can't name a single thing when I did something like this or even close. I just asked my sister to finish making my coffee and bring it to me, went to my room to change into something something else and however stupid it won't sound I started crying. I felt so exposed and embarrassed. Basically everyone at home saw me half naked and no one reacted in any way. Then my mother started knocking to my room to let her in and when I refused she started acting like a victim ""cause I don't have any respect towards her"" and my father started screaming at me for acting like that. Once again, I felt so embarrassed and I'm disgusted by her after what she did. 

That's not the first time when she's being like that though. I have a prom in a few days and she's constantly talking how it's visible that I gained weight in this tight dress (I'm not overweight, I exercise a lot and trying to keep shape) and constantly asks me to step on a scale to see how much I weigh. On the other hand she's obese. I really tried to help her with her diets many times or find her some exercises (she wants to lose weight badly). She's doing nothing, crying how it's not working at all and comes to me for help again. 

A few days before we were discussing how my sister will attend school next year (currently she's taking online classes due to her inability to attend school physically). Basically I just told her that it won't be as easy as it is now and high school will require more than waking up at 1pm, attending 3 hours of classes through the computer, not brushing her teeth and staying up all night playing games. My mother started screaming at me how I know nothing, telling me that I'm unfair towards my sister, I'm selfish, fucked up and I shouldn't be talking about it at all since I'm not even close to being intelligent and all those books I'm reading are going nowhere (I'm on top of my class in private school). And don't get me wrong, I love my sister, I want everything what's best for her and I have amazing relationship with her. I just know that she's kinda lazy and can't do anything by herself and I mean she won't even use deodorant until someone reminds her.

Another time I accidentally spilled some juice and started cleaning it immediately but she started a full blown argument, telling my father how I did it on purpose just to make her life harder, I'm ruining everything I touch, she never met such a disgusting kid, I'm not respecting her and if I'll try to say anything else she'll hurt me.

I'm really wondering what have I done to her to hate me so much. I was the one supporting her when she was crying to me about my father's affairs or problem with alcohol (I was 12), I was always bringing home best grades, praises from everyone, never asked for help, learning a few languages, helping her around the house, helping my sister with her every assignment and getting to private school just to make my parents proud but Im starting to feel like nothing could make them even like me. Mama is always acting the same and my father isn't talking to me at all (we live in one house). I'm always helping her with everything but she's getting worse everyday and this shirt incident was too much for me.

Am I anyhow justified for being sick of her and being disgusted by her actions? Cause I honestly have thoughts that I'm in fact being selfish and shouldn't be thinking about my parents this way. 
So sorry for it being so long and that you so so so much to anyone who read this <33

1i068hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/1i068hd/after_life/,After life?,"When people talk about death, it’s always about one of two things: pearly white gates or eternal damnation. For millions of people, those are the only options, and they fight tooth and nail in order to make it to the former. But what happens if you die and arrive at nothing?

That’s the question I asked myself as I lay in hospital bed after hospital bed, watching doctors tell my parents over and over again that there’s “nothing they can do.” They wouldn’t take that as an answer. It only got worse as the days passed; I could see through the mask my parents had painted on haphazardly. There was no hiding the baggy and dark under eyes, coffee breath, and dissociation that I witnessed daily. Yet, they journeyed on, pulling me along with them. There were many times when I wanted them to stop, to carry on without me, but when I looked into those brown and blue eyes, the words wouldn’t come. They’d given up everything for me: their dreams, money, and time to save me. Their whole life was me, even if they couldn’t say that aloud. Everything was… fine, I guess, up until a week ago. 

I opened my eyes to my room, which my parents had taken the liberty of decorating when they knew I couldn’t. It was dim, with the lights they’d strung being the only source of light. I’d looked to my right, eyeing the photo frame on the nightstand: my parents and I, years before I got sick. I couldn’t cry out of fear and sadness or yell out in frustration. I just stared, taking in the entirety of the photo. My dad had full, thick black hair, which opposed his now thinning, graying hair. My mother, once known for her graceful aging, had begun to wrinkle, her skin growing dryer and dryer from the hospital air. Whether it was just time or stress that had come from this, I’ll never know. 

Finally, there was me. I had hair just like my dad’s, but more curly thanks to my mom’s. He used to say that I was “stealing his follicles.” My skin was tan, not just from my heritage but from being outside all day. Hiking was my hobby, no, my passion. Ever since my mother took me on my first, I’d been obsessed with them, cataloging everything we’d seen. My own skin paled in comparison to the tan. It was barely even beige. I looked back through the glass, spotting my parents and the new doctor they’d pleaded with to take care of me. I didn’t have to hear it to understand what she was saying. My mother fell into my father’s arms, and he was barely able to keep himself standing, let alone her. 
They cleaned themselves up the best they could before walking in, smiles plastered on their faces. They didn’t think I noticed, but I always did. They told me the news I’d heard a thousand times before, and as they gave me the big speech on not giving up, I realized that this was it; there was nothing left for me. Even if they weren’t ready, I was. With the little strength I had, I shook my head. No. Their faces contorted into a look I couldn’t exactly pinpoint, but I assume it was a mix of confusion and worry. Their pleas and cries hurt, but not more than the pain I was in. I couldn’t take it anymore. 

I looked around one last time, trying to picture home, my room. It was still colored pink, the color I chose at the ripe age of 5, minus one teal wall because I thought pink was too girly. My bed, with the strawberry-printed sheets I’d gotten for Christmas years ago; they were still my favorite. My eyes closed, and suddenly, I could see the memories play out: my first tooth falling out, the sleepovers I’d make my parents have with me when thunderstorms came around, the time I broke my arm while trying to climb the large oak tree in the backyard. I smiled, for the first time in what seemed like months, and my hearing became muffled, though I could still hear my parents. My breathing became slower, with brief erratic intakes. I was scared. A tear flowed down my face, and, without warning, everything became silent. There was no beeping from medical machines or 3 a.m. wake-up calls for tests. There was nothing. And there still is nothing. I can’t answer the question I’d been asking myself.

You know that feeling when everything around you seems out of control, but there's that one thing that always brings you back to earth? Yep, that's your grounding routine. We all have one... or at least, we desperately need one! Let me share mine, and then you spill yours (just metaphorically, no coffee stains on screens, please! 😉).

So, picture this: **every morning at 6:00 AM**, before the chaos of the day even thinks about waking up. It's just me, my ancient pair of running shoes, and the open road. I'm not even a ""runner."" More like a ""brisk jogger"" who occasionally stops to admire the clouds... erm, catch my breath. The world is quiet, the air is crisp, and for 20 glorious minutes, it feels like the universe has hit pause.

**Why is this my superhero routine?** 🦸‍♀️
- **Clear Start**: There's nothing like fresh air to blow away yesterday's stress and shake off morning grogginess. Who needs coffee when nature is brewing a multi-sensory breakfast?
- **Mindfulness**: It's not just about fitness, but that beautiful solitude where I can think about nothing... or everything. My brain can either percolate on dreams or just listen to the birds chattering about last night's gossip.
- **Predictability**: When everything is haywire (and with three kids, a full-time job, and a cat who thinks he's a toddler, it often is), this little slice of ""same old, same old"" keeps my feet on the ground. *Literally.*

But hey, routines aren't one-size-fits-all. Maybe for you, it's that steaming cup of tea while flipping through *an actual paper book* (yep, they still exist!). Or perhaps it's blasting your go-to tunes while pretending your showerhead is a microphone. 🎤

Okay, here's something to ponder... **What happens if you miss your grounding routine?** Do you feel off-kilter? Is everyone else somehow more annoying? Maybe it's just me.

I wanna know what keeps your *feet* planted and your *mind* soaring. Drop your thoughts or stories in a metaphorical comment box. Here’s to finding our daily peace rituals, no matter how chaotic life gets. 💫

Whether it's your first time visiting or you're returning for the umpteenth, Paris continues to captivate travelers with its timeless charm, world-class art, and culinary delights. Here's a guide to some of the best things to do in Paris, as well as some lesser-known gems that will make your trip unforgettable.

# The Iconic Landmarks

No visit to Paris is complete without a stop at the **Eiffel Tower**. Whether you choose to ascend its towering heights for panoramic views of the city or simply marvel at it from below, this architectural wonder is as enchanting by day as it is by night when it sparkles every hour on the hour. If you want to avoid the crowds, consider visiting early in the morning or later in the evening.

Just a short walk away is the **Champs-Élysées**, one of the world's most famous avenues. Stroll from the Arc de Triomphe, which honors French soldiers, down to Place de la Concorde. The broad avenue is lined with luxurious boutiques, cafés, and theaters, offering a quintessential Parisian experience.

The **Notre-Dame Cathedral** is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. Although it was severely damaged in the 2019 fire, the cathedral remains an iconic landmark of Paris. Its restoration is underway, but the exterior, with its intricate stonework and flying buttresses, still draws crowds.

For art lovers, the **Louvre Museum** is a must-visit. Home to thousands of works, including the famous **Mona Lisa** and **Venus de Milo**, the Louvre is a treasure trove of art and history. With its vast collection, it's easy to get lost in the galleries, so be sure to plan your visit to focus on the sections that interest you the most.

# Hidden Gems and Off-the-Beaten-Path Experiences

Beyond the well-known landmarks, Paris is brimming with hidden gems waiting to be discovered.

One such place is the **Le Marais** district, a charming blend of medieval streets, trendy boutiques, and historic landmarks. The **Place des Vosges**, one of the oldest squares in Paris, is a peaceful spot perfect for a leisurely stroll or picnic. The neighborhood also boasts the **Picasso Museum**, housed in a stately hôtel particulier, and the **Musée Carnavalet**, which offers an intriguing look at Parisian history.

Another hidden gem is **Canal Saint-Martin**, a trendy, bohemian area that’s far less touristy than other parts of Paris. Wander along the canal, stopping for a coffee at one of the many cafés, or enjoy the quaint boutiques and shops in the area. It's a great spot for a relaxing afternoon away from the crowds.

If you're a fan of quirky and unique experiences, the **Catacombs of Paris** is an eerie yet fascinating underground network of tunnels, which were originally limestone quarries but were later turned into a burial ground. It’s an unusual way to explore Paris’s history and offers a very different perspective on the city.

# Culinary Delights

Paris is synonymous with food. The city’s cafés and patisseries are world-renowned for their quality, variety, and artistry. Start your day with a classic French breakfast of **croissants** and **café au lait** at a sidewalk café. For lunch, nothing beats a warm, flaky **quiche Lorraine** or a decadent **croque-monsieur** paired with a glass of wine.

For dessert, indulge in a delicate **macaron** from **Ladurée**, or enjoy a melt-in-your-mouth **tarte Tatin** at a cozy bistro. And if you're truly a foodie, don’t miss out on a trip to **Marché des Enfants Rouges**, the oldest covered market in Paris, where you can sample fresh, local produce and gourmet food from all over the world.

If you're feeling adventurous, venture beyond traditional French cuisine and explore the food scene in **Belleville**. This multicultural neighborhood offers flavors from China, North Africa, and other parts of the world, making it an exciting culinary adventure.

# The Parisian Lifestyle

One of the true pleasures of Paris is simply embracing the rhythm of the city. There’s a certain art to just **being** in Paris—whether it's people-watching at a café, wandering through the Luxembourg Gardens, or enjoying the ambiance of a quiet street at sunset.

Take time to experience **Parisian café culture**. Instead of rushing through a meal, savor each moment with a coffee or wine and observe the world go by. Embrace the leisurely pace, and don’t be afraid to engage with locals—whether it’s exchanging pleasantries or discovering hidden spots off the tourist trail.

For a more romantic experience, a **Seine river cruise** at sunset is a magical way to see Paris from a different angle. As you drift past landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame, the city’s lights twinkle on the water, making for an unforgettable experience.

# Conclusion

Paris is a city that offers something for everyone: romance, art, history, cuisine, and more. While the well-trodden paths are filled with iconic landmarks, the true essence of Paris is often found in its quieter corners—whether in the intimate atmosphere of a café, the charm of a hidden alley, or the serenity of one of its many gardens. So, whether you’re in Paris for the first time or the fiftieth, there’s always something new to discover in the City of Light.",1,1736742616.0,travellingo,0,1.0,False

I Bell 19, went to my very first dog show this weekend. I had a junior handler Syd (17) that was supposed to show my Doberman pincher, so I paid for the hotel room, food, coffee, pretty much everything that she needed. And she ended up not showing my dog, she told me that there was a ring difference and that's why she was not able to show my dog and from what l've heard, she actually switched my dog to someone else's dog that she wanted to show more, I got a hint of this when she finished her show and and talk to me 30 minutes before my show also watching me show, She was supposed to show her before me. The only reason I paid for everything is because she was showing my dog and I am really upset. The only thing I asked her to pay was $40 for gas (I spent 80) and she actually asked me to cash app her the $40 when possible after I dropped her off. In total this weekend, I spent about $400, would it be wrong with me to ask her for half of that? By myself, do not have a lot of money and I worked really hard for this show. It was something that we had planned for a month so it's not like she didn't have time to cancel with me. I feel like she's old enough to know better, I'm also going to figure out how I can pull up ring times and make sure that I am correct before I make any action, but I just wanted to hear what everyone else's opinions",1,1736742352.0,ShowDogs,3,1.0,False

He's contemplated going back to the temple, sealing us in marriage (which i expressed not wanting that as I'd rather my afterlife just be sleeping eternally), and getting rid of the weed I bought him for Christmas (which was not cheap and I would have been pissed as hell if he did), etc.

We ended up in a fight where I kept pointing out the inconsistencies in this cult (ex. Coffee and diet coke that mitt Romney drank, government saying whether polygamy can stay or Utah can be a state, etc.) I, again would have been fine with Christianity, as at least it was more consistent with its teachings.

He was able to have one of his friends out of state to talk him out of going all out and just to read the scriptures. (I owe Jim a dirty soda if I ever meet him.) Even so, I'm scared of losing him, as we are very compatible.

(18M),"I (18M) have a friend (18F) that I’ve known since kindergarten, but we were never really that close until recently. Two months ago, her boyfriend of three years broke up with her on bad terms and she started to initiate hangouts with me basically every second day - coffee, cinema, ice skating - you name it. A month ago we went on a city break with a friend group of five - there was a moment when we were walking behind everyone and she linked arms with me stating that she’s cold, there was a moment in the airplane when she took a nap on my shoulder, yadda yadda. I started spending a ton of time at her house just hanging out us two alone, talking, watching movies and she’s the one to invite me. She compliments me often.

And I know, it sounds like she’s interested and I’m just totally oblivious but hear me out - I still doubt it and I’m afraid to make a move. She has repeatedly called me her ‚best friend’ on multiple occassions which puts me off, she has no issue mentioning that she went on a date with another boy and that she finds him attractive, her conversations with me often focus on her ex’s behavior, and in general I wouldn’t place a bet on whether she sees something in me or just considers me a platonic friend. And the linking arms and shoulder naps? Maybe she’s just really touchy?

How do I let her know I’m interested? Do I ask directly if she likes me? Do I just explicitly ask her out on a date (despite feeling like those hangouts are already dates?) Do I take the risk of rejection and completely ruining the friendship and possibly my reputation as gossip will arise? Should I be subtle or direct? Take it slow or clarify things immediately? I’m worried the opportunity might pass.",1,1736742267.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1i05x5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1i05x5w/december_trip_report/,December trip report,"I got so much help here when I was planning our trip, I thought I'd post a report. 

1. Accommodation. We stayed in Citadines Bastille, 3 minutes walk from place de la Bastille. It suited us perfectly as we wanted a kitchen, and it was easy access to the city. We booked 2 studio apartments, our teenagers stayed in 1 which was bliss for all of us ha ha! 

2. Transport. We walked about 15k steps daily.  The city is just so pretty to walk around. We caught maybe 1 metro a day, and found the system so easy to use. We just used Google maps, which told us the line to catch and where the nearest stations were. We were there for a week but arrived mid week so the weekly card was no use to us. We bought the Navigo pass and added a fare wherever we needed to. We had one funny incident where it took us 20 minutes to find our exit out of Chatelet 😄 but other than that we had no issues. 

3. Pickpockets. I worried about this a lot based on reports but we had no issues. We all  used a  cheap phone strap to tie it to our bags, which also prevented us leaving it behind accidentally. We were juggling hats, scarves, gloves, leaflets & purchases plus taking lots of pictures so it would've been easy to drop a phone! 

4. Eiffel Tower tickets - I couldn't book them online before we travelled but was able to book them while there, online, for the next day. We went to the tippy top an hour before sunset so we saw the view in daytime, then sunset then watched the city light up. Then when we came down we saw it sparkle (which started at 6pm)

5. Booking attractions - we got the Paris museum pass and booked the essential things in advance  (on the website view all monuments then filter by mandatory reservation). We got to see everything we wanted. Most places were allowing walk-ins as well but that usually meant a longer wait, and we missed out on musee D'Orsay because we didn't make an advance booking and didn't have time to queue before our next activity. 

6. Food. It was almost all fabulous! For lunch, we just looked for somewhere when we got hungry. We either picked somewhere that was busy, or that had lots of ratings on Google. In the evenings we walked to one of several local restaurant areas, then picked one.The street food was amazing. Favourite meals were from pinnochio creperie near the Pantheon, and tartiflettes from the Christmas markets. We didn't eat as much boulangerie/patisserie food as I thought we would, but what we had was amazing. The meals were all very filling and satisfying

7. Coffee - the French do this so well. Even just an automated coffee machine in a chain bakery. Without fail the coffee was amazing! 

8. Weather - we got lucky, it rained very little and wasn't windy. Temps varied between 0°c &  10-12°c. We had coats designed for 0°c and only needed a thin layer underneath, plus scarf/hat/gloves as needed. We brought merino underclothes but barely used them. I had an umbrella but it was impossible to use because the streets were so busy! 

9. Favourite sights - Saint Chapelle & the catacombs were my favourite paid attractions, but overall just wandering around was the best. Everywhere you look there's a pretty door or window, ancient church, elaborate public building or adorable doggy! ",15,1736742260.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,1.0,False

I come from a low income background (my parental contribution should be very low if at all since my parents do not have income sources anymore) but I’ve saved up 70k in stocks and 40k in my Roth IRA over the last four years. 

I had saved this money for law school but I’m looking for clarity to how HLS determines student contribution. Is it going to be the case that the roughly $100k I saved will go towards my student contribution and will be subtracted from the financial aid I will get? 

My parents have never been to America (I was fortunate to get a full scholarship for undergrad), but I do want to get them here in August so they can see a glimpse of my life here and celebrate with me. I would also like to have $10k per year in case I need it for any expenses, going out for food, coffee, alc. etc.

I am medication to try and help with my OCD.  I have spent alot of time learning coping skills and I religiously use them. But there is a stigma with OCD and I feel when I talk about OCD I get 1 of 2 responses. 

1. I have OCD to I like always have to have my  coffee cups in order ( example)
2. * eye roll* yeah everyone thinks they have OCD (example)

These are based off of my personal experience  hence why I am here asking for help; constructive criticism  welcome but please don't be hurtful.


So part of my *sparkle* is everytime I pump something  ( lotion, shampoo, handsome, dishsoap, laundry soap, soda fountains, pumping gas )

I always pump it to seven. ( I developed 7 because when my hair was super long it was the perfect amount of product for me. I thought 🙃)

I have learned to control myself and while I always need to pump it to seven as an adult I understand that sometimes those pumps need to be super tiny so I'm not totally wasteful. ( wasn't so mindful as a child)

-refocus- I count this number in my head everytime and I cannot remember a time I ever told anyone about this because I do alot of weird things but hey.

Then I was trying to talk to someone I love trust and confide in about my diagnosis ( idk how to spell its late ok)

I was telling him.
I have BPD
PtSD 
OcD 
AdHD
Panic disorders
Bi-polar 
Pmdss

They responded  with  they just love to throw diagnosis  around

( mind you these have been long confirmed by several doctors)

This made me paranoid he thought I was lying and what if I was lying to myself!

So then I started to like notice me counting the pumps and other behaviors. 

Then I was like * he was right see I am thinking about the pumps!*

Then I have still proceeded to count every pump since treflecting on this conversation  because I felt so invalidated.  This conversation was 2 years ago.

I have spent 2 years counting the pumps to prove I was like * being dramatic or I'm faking the OCD*

7 pumps all day everyday I think all I have done is prove to myself that I have it
