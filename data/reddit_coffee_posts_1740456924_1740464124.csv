I also used small batch local roasters and Ily. I used the Pico grinder and it was a coarser ground than I’m using in G3 and I used a pressurized basket. I can’t get the espresso right with the G3. I grind on 11 with Pico. 18 g coffee with 36 gram liquid espresso. Water temp is at 200. I’ve tried 25-35 second pull times. I’ve tried lower and higher temps. Finer and coarser grinds. I’ve tried a local artisan roaster with very fresh roast dates and the Starbucks blonde. I use Crystal Geyser spring water. The output is consistently sour. I’m clearly doing something wrong but I can’t figure it out. Tips?

I'm into comedy and frequent comedy clubs, and have met a few great women through that.

I'll meet someone and we'll talk about going to a show together, but then too often things come up and  a girl flakes because of something coming up (which usually sounds legit). But then they don't offer alternatives so I take the hint.

And then sometimes I'll meet a girl and ask her to get a coffee or drink, but then have the hardest time  finding a time.

I don't do much else socially, so it's hard to invite people to join me other times.

1ixo8gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ixo8gm/my_gerd_diagnosismanaging_symptoms/,My GERD Diagnosis/Managing symptoms,"Hi all, I've been lurking on this subreddit since I (30F) got diagnosed in December. Only until this past weekend did the symptoms finally lighten up - I figured I'd make a post in case it's relatable or helps sonehow. Sorry in advance for the length!

I got diagnosed in December mainly due to what I think was the consequences of a overly acidic/high fat diet and lifestyle choices. I was drinking coffee/some kind of caffeine daily, a high fat breakfast like an bacon egg and cheese bagel, and usually pretty decent lunches and dinners with meat, fiber, and vegetables. However, I have been a SPICE lover since I was a kid - every meal I would add hot sauce, chili oil, or salsa of sone kind, usually alot. I loved eating those spicy buldak noodles as well. Weekends I'd typically treat myself to things like pizza, wingstop, etc to celebrate the end of the workweek, and often eat late at night. I also go out and drink some weekends. For further context, I used to be vegan/vegetarian for years, and I started eating meat again when I became more interested in muscle growth in the past 2 years. I don't smoke anymore, but used to smoke green regularly for years, since I was a teenager to about a year ago. I think these things have chronically irritated my gut and esophagus for years before it came to a head.

Periodically over the past two years, I'd sometimes wake up in the middle of the night choking and feeling breathless - it always freaked me out and I thought I was dying. I noticed long lasting burping too when I drank things like kombucha and soda. A sour taste began lingering. I got COVID a few times too which led to long-lasting coughs on top of this - I was prescribed an inhaler and antihistamines which helped a bit. Phlegm became a constant, and I was spitting it out all day long. I would constantly lose my voice and I'd chalk it up to my job where I lecture a lot. Most recently in December I got what felt like a terrible flu - I was dizzy, had a headache, fever, couldn't focus, and felt congestion in my ears, nose, and a sore throat. I also felt an awful burn at the bottom of my throat that now was lasting days and wouldn't go away. It kept me up at night. They tested me for COVID and strep and found nothing. I got the hunch it could be GERD based on the burn I felt and told my PCP, and the flu symptoms might be caused by inflammation to the rest of my upper respiratory system (could also just be flu/cold too). She examined me including pressing on my stomach which had pain and seemed to confirm the GERD diagnosis for her. I went cold turkey, cutting out all trigger foods (for me, animal fats, tomato, spice, and caffeine were the worst) and was put on an 8 week omeprazole dose. 

I didn't like the omeprazole - while it reduced my symptoms, the side effects were not it. The only positive (?) was reducing my appetite by alot. I'm glad I'm off it now (just finished a week ago). However, the rebound was CRAZY and felt like a week of hell. I bought a bunch of items that seemed to reduce the episode, like a wedge pillow and taking licorice root and tea. I was wearing mouth tape to prevent dry mouth during this period as well. 

Currently the rebound is gone, and I've even reintroduced a couple trigger foods sparingly like tomato sauce and coffee. However, I already feel the low familiar burn creeping bsck and am not going further. Nothing is worth the sleeplessness and throat pain. I hope to stay off PPIs and am going to ask for an endoscopy next time I see my doctor, just to be safe. I've lost some weight as well from the diet change while maintaining excercise. Hoping for the best, but I know this is something I might have to deal and live with for good now...thanks for reading!",1,1740463571.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Boss didn’t like my attempts… I need help.,"I work as a barista, it’s *usually* a pleasant job… but this position I work with kitchen staff and only serve 20-60 drinks a day... I help them when I can and try not to add to their dishes. Yet, the stress makes it feel like “The bear” episode every day…

I am now into the rhythm of things, and I was using podcasts and music to help me zone into the grove… now that I’m a few weeks in my boss said I couldn’t do that anymore… 

I tried to get over it, but the issue is that this job is lonely as hell since I am aways away from people and I have CPTSD. I thought things were better but when only doing physical or muscle memory things for 8 hours a day… my symptoms are kicking up again. Particularly the auditory hallucinations, i hear things every half a minute when I don’t keep my mind engaged or zone out and struggle to think at all.

During a dead period I picked up a book, reading a short poem between doing other tasks. Just anything to keep my mind from going insane… I just figured it wouldn’t be an issue since I would use it less than people used phones… I was wrong and my boss talked to me.

I tried to explain I need mental stimulation and my boss just offered more monotonous tasks, mindless tasks - more cleaning, packaging pre-prepped food... I don’t know how to keep myself sane here, it’s 15% serving drinks, 35% waiting for people, and the rest of the time is cleaning constantly.

I like the job, the people, but… the reason I like coffee jobs is cause of the social aspect and occasional laid back times where I can be creative or learn things. I need advice on what I can do to keep myself engaged… I already thought of a ton of drink recipes.

TLDR; My job is muscle memory and physical activity, my mind is starting to go crazy and my boss won’t let me do anything mentally engaging. What do you do to keep your mind going?",1,1740463309.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

Long story short, my friend started seeing this therapist through a joint practice about a year ago, and she was seeing the therapist in-person at her office, which was in a shared office space at a joint practice that was run collectively (idk the details of the organization or how it was set up).

A few months into their sessions her therapist went on mat leave, and offered to refer her to another therapist in the office. My friend didn’t feel like she was urgently in need of therapy at the time and chose to put therapy on hold instead. 

A few months later, she was going through a tough time so she reached out and asked the therapist when she was returning from mat leave and whether she’d be open to doing a zoom session in the mean time. The therapist agreed, but offered her a reduced rate, and told her she’d have to pay her directly instead of through the office, and also that she wouldn’t be able to expense the session through her benefits. 

My friend agreed to this, and since then she has been seeing this therapist regularly. At first they stuck to zoom sessions, but recently they’ve been meeting up in local coffee shops to have their “sessions”. The therapist will buy my friend coffee and they’ll sit in public and just talk for an hour. When she told me she was meeting her therapist for coffee, that’s when I got worried. Not only is this a huge confidentiality risk to me, I was shocked that a licensed therapist would so casually suggest this without properly instructing her of the potential risks and liability of conducting therapy in public. They also didn’t discuss any plan for what to do if they ran into someone either of them knew, which to me feels like a very obvious issue to address, and not addressing it feels to me that this is not meeting the informed consent requirement for therapy. 

Even more concerning is that this therapist has not stated if or when she will be returning to mat leave and therefore able to work out of her office again. She’s not mentioned whether the practice knows she is seeing clients privately on the side. It’s pretty clear that if she was profit sharing with the practice, she is no longer, which is probably what justifies the reduced rate. 

Anyways, so my friend is now just paying this woman $150 a week out of pocket to meet her in a coffee shop so she can tell her about her life. She said that the quality of therapy has not drastically changed and she enjoys spending time with her and having someone to “catch up with” on a regular basis, but isn’t that just a friendship at this point? Beyond just weird and/or unusual, does anyone know if this is even legal or allowed within the code of ethics for licensed psychotherapists? ",0,1740463124.0,TalkTherapy,3,0.5,False

Much similar to Craig's own account, Tweek's is very limited on details, considering how Craig can't even see the twenty three posts he's made, he has more followers than Craig does, though, and he follows fewer people than that. His profile picture is what seems to be a picture of himself in the sunlight, but Craig can't really observe it since he can't click on it either. His bio is empty apart from a simple Tweek. 17. Coffee enthusiast.
What Craig does next should be cataloged as probably the stupidest thing he's ever done, and that says a lot. Going to his own profile, Craig looks through his gallery, searching for whatever picture he can find. He ends up choosing a selfie he'd taken a month ago where he's sitting on his bed with Stripe on top of his chullo-free head, her little face peeking through his black hair. Setting it as his profile picture, he then clicks on the option to customize his bio, and types Craig. 17. Space enthusiast.
Giving himself approximately two seconds to think this over, his brain immediately sets on his usual fuck it, who cares? motto, and he looks for Tweek's profile again, holding his breath as he taps on the request to follow blue button.

It's a 2 hour and 7 minute long harmonic funky house mix that I tried to keep true to the style that I danced to all those years ago, at least in how it felt and how fast it was.  129 BPM   Please enjoy!

Done on a DDJ200, with some creative use of the CFX knob to add some atmosphere and extra funkiness at times.

I slammed my card into the machine quickly to not lose a tick and whilst the machine was taking payment, I went back to the game and resumed two ticking the tree.

I realised when my coffee arrived what I had done.

The revelation that a “note from the future” cannot exist completely changed my perspective, converting me from a determinist to a believer in Libertarian Free Will.

I just saw a commercial space renting for 13k a month here in manila and Im working here also. My house is just 4km away. Reasons kung bakit giniveup nung previous na naguupa is because nagtaas ng renta. 

The commercial space is situated sa jeepney hub and sa baranggay hall.

And kahilera ito ng 711 and unclejohns. Marami na ring fishballan and kwekwekan dito kasi madalas ako magmeryenda sa lugar nato. 

Sa money concerns I can say up to 500k kaya ko magpondo since savings ko un. 

Mga naiisip kong business ay dapat 24hrs para sustainable sa 13k dahil for me ang mahal ng renta niya kaso manila to e and consistent flow ng tao.

And mostly nagwowork sa pasay, makati, etc. mga nandito. May mga students din dahil may school sa likod ng jeepney hub. 

Mga naisip ko ay:
✔️Fishballan
✔️ Mango grahams 
✔️ Milktea /coffee
✔️Sioma-yan
✔️ Potato giant (kaso hindi 24hrs)

Mga hindi pwede:
❌ Sari sari store (3 na sa isang hilera pa lang)
❌ Pandesalan
❌Vapeshop (di ko lang trip)

Mga alanganin:
Lottoo outlet ( ung small bettors)

So i parked behind a coffee shop in front of this rock wall/hill, it’s hard to explain because it is literally a huge rock wall and on top of it is an apartment complex. Well when i parked directly over me is a railing so people who live in the complex can walk around and not fall over and get hurt. a few minutes after parking i’m still sitting in my car and two kids start throwing huge rocks (like the size of a fist) over the railing on top of my car hitting the back of my car almost breaking the back windshield (i have a coupe). as soon as i heard a big crash i got out of my car because i was confused on what happened and i look up and the kids continued to throw another rock while im outside my car hitting the hood of my car. i quickly got in and drove to a parking spot away from the kids and i got out and called my mom (i am a student and this has never happened to me so i didn’t know what to do) i also took pictures of them instantly and the damage on my car. then i called non emergency and waited for a cop for 45 mins to come by. while i waited i drove up to the complex and looked for them but they ran away. when the cop came i filed a police report and he tried to help me look for the kids too but they were gone. he told me if i find out who they are i can file a civil lawsuit against their parents. well i went back today and actually saw the kids in the same spot around the railings , they live literally in front of that spot. what do i do now? do i knock on their parents door and tell them what happened and ask for their information? if they don’t give it to me do i call non emergency again?

Just in the past few shifts I’ve had this interaction countless times

Customer: “Can I get a Java chip/caramel ribbon crunch/etc frappe without coffee” 

Me: Sure! *rings up crème version of that frappe*

Customer: “I didn’t ask for that, I asked for the ABC without coffee. Can you make sure it’s right”

When customers say this I always just smile at them and say in an almost artificially sweet voice something like “Right so that’s a completely different frappe! It has its own name and everything isn’t that cool? That makes it so easy for everyone that’s not a fan of caffeine”

The frappes are just an example, but the same could go for blonde espresso in drinks with alternative milks and the list goes on. For the amount of times customers treat baristas as if we’re stupid and don’t know what we’re doing, these passive aggressive ways to call them a dumbass is cathartic. Just as a reminder, the barista works there and knows the ingredients. You don’t, and probably couldn’t tell me how your favorite drink is made. You know when it tastes off sure, but you probably couldn’t step into some non slips and make it yourself.

I lost my job before this one due to layoffs in an industry you most definitely can’t keep for nearly a decade being as stupid as some of these customers think we are, while being so themselves. It’s like customers forget I didn’t just spontaneously birth myself from the espresso grounds like Aphrodite and have only ever lived, breathed and known Starbucks. It’s also just a testament to how people in general think service workers are lesser just because what we do to keep the basic necessities.

This rant just goes to say; Your barista more than likely knows what they’re doing, and you most likely do not. They might’ve been the colleague you see in the elevator at work, who you probably needed help from on a few occasions. They might be working here to pay for a chemical engineering degree, premed or prelaw, and they’re more than likely not fucking stupid. Treat them as such.

As the title states, for the past 5-6 months (since early September), I (30M) have been in a relationship with a woman (24F) that I’m finally starting to accept was extremely toxic.

We matched on a dating app, and right from the start, we clicked over so many shared hobbies and interests, anime, gaming, horror movies, and so much more. We spent hours talking about our favourite shows and games, often laughing and bonding over the things that brought us joy. It felt natural, and for a while, those moments of connection were some of the best parts of our relationship. We could just be ourselves, enjoying what we loved, and I felt like we were really building something special.

As we grew closer, I was also drawn to her emotional vulnerability. She had a lot of trauma from a difficult childhood and past abusive relationships, and I could relate to that, having experienced my own challenges. I wanted to support her, to help her heal, and to create something safe and meaningful together. I cared deeply about her and wanted to show her that she wasn’t alone in her struggles.

I always tried to handle everything with absolute care, striving to meet her emotional needs and be there for her when she was struggling. I even sought professional help from my own therapy to ensure that I was interacting with her in the healthiest, most supportive way possible. I wanted to be the partner she deserved, someone who could help her work through her pain without adding to it.

But despite these shared moments and my efforts to support her, no matter how much I tried, listening, adapting my communication, reassuring her, it never seemed to be enough. Whenever conflict arose, which began to increase in frequency as the relationship went on, all my attempts to clarify, apologize, or find common ground were dismissed or twisted back on me. She told me I didn’t understand her, that I made her feel unsafe, that my presence alone drained her and made her hate herself. She even admitted to deliberately acting out in ways to “prove me right” when I expressed concerns.

One of the most confusing things was how often conflicts felt like they came out of nowhere. There were moments when I genuinely didn’t understand what I had done wrong. For example, one time, we were just relaxing at my place watching TV, and I asked if she wanted a hot drink. Her response was “Okay?” in a puzzled tone, with a confused look on her face. I could sense the discomfort but tried to roll with it, so I asked, “Would you like a coffee or tea?” She hesitated and said, “Coffee, I guess…” I still felt something was off, so I asked, “Are you sure? Doesn’t sound like you want anything.” That’s when it quickly escalated into an argument, with her accusing me of overanalysing her “just being herself” and telling me that if I couldn’t accept her personality, then we were an incompatible match and she wanted to go home. When I then offered to drive her home because it was the middle of the night, she then said ""I'm not going home"" I asked her where then and I'm happy to take her their as it's the middle of the night or even pay for an Uber, she said ""I'm going to my ex's because at least he knows how to take care of me."" and later going ""I'll just wander around at night and if I get assaulted, that's just the way things are."" Which hurt a lot and in hindsight should have been a pretty big sign to end things especially considering I had only shortly earlier told her how being cheated on really broke me, had opened up about my own SA, and overall I could hear her tone of voice screaming malicious intent.

It was moments like this that left me feeling like I was always walking on eggshells, unsure if what seemed like a harmless conversation was going to turn into a huge argument. My attempts to stand up for myself and get clarity only seemed to make things worse or lead me to being further blamed for not being good enough.

She also told me not to talk to my friends because “they weren’t in the relationship.” But I felt myself going crazy at times, drained, confused, and emotionally spent, so I reached out to them anyway. I needed someone to talk to, someone who could help me make sense of it all. My friends noticed straight away the red flags, but I pushed their concerns aside, clinging to the hope that love could fix things, that if I just tried harder, it would get better. My friendships took a hit because of this and I feel so guilty about this.

I want to make it clear that at no point did I ever respond to her mistreatment with anger, violence, or abusive language. I never resorted to controlling behaviour or tried to manipulate her emotionally. Despite the conflict and the hurtful things said, like when she would call me a ""fucking asshole"" or say that she ""hated my guts and wish I died."" Despite not doing or saying anything to deserve this and how much it hurt, I always made sure to approach the situation calmly and never raised my voice or used language to attack her character. I know that abuse comes in many forms, and I was never physically or verbally abusive. But the emotional toll it took on me was real.

To be clear, I’m not saying I was perfect. I can only speak from my experience, and I know relationships take effort from both sides. I’m sure I could’ve done things differently, and I own that. But the difference here was that every discussion became a battle, and I was constantly made to feel like the sole problem, no matter how much I tried to communicate and adapt.

In fact, there were times when I would attempt to de-escalate or pause a conversation to give us both time to cool down and return to it later, because I wanted us to approach things calmly and constructively. But she would refuse, accusing me of “not doing enough” or “giving up easily.” That really hurt, because I was giving everything I had, emotionally, financially, physically, to support her through her tough times. I was doing everything I could, but it never felt like it was enough, no matter how much I tried.

Then, about two and a half months into the relationship, she dropped a bombshell: she claimed to have Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and couldn’t remember the past few months because I was in a relationship with one of her alters. She suddenly became a lot nicer, easier to get along with, and said she wanted to continue the relationship and “learn to know me.” She even reviewed past messages, telling me, “This is the polar opposite of me, and I’m so sorry you had to deal with this, I understand if you don’t want to continue.” She essentially gave me an out, but I was still clinging onto the hope that things could get better. I chose to continue.

Shortly after, she would revert back to her previous behaviour, treating me terribly again. When I would ask why, she would say, “I let my alter take over because I was scared of being a burden on you,” and that she was so sorry. I shouldn't have taken her back in those moments, but in my desperation to prove I was good enough and that we could make it work, I did.

I realize now that love shouldn’t feel like walking on eggshells, begging to be understood, or sacrificing your sense of self just to keep the peace. When one person’s needs, boundaries, and emotional well-being are consistently disregarded while they’re made to feel responsible for the entire relationship’s success, that crosses the line into toxicity.

I’m not sure why I’m posting this. Maybe to vent. Maybe to hear from people who’ve been through something similar. I’m not posting out of bitterness, I just need to acknowledge what it was, for my own peace of mind.

Call me stupid, but I loved her. In hindsight, I don’t think she loved me. And either way, I don’t think love is supposed to hurt this much or be this abusive. Thanks for listening.",0,1740460686.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.5,False

Diagnosis: I recently got a MRI that “suggests” I have “very mild adeno in the upper uterus” and a “benign left vaginal wall cyst” but my gyno said that does not explain the severity of my pain. 

My symptoms: Since my first period, which I’ve had for 5 yrs, on my menstrual cycle I’m in debilitating pain, I can’t eat or really move in the morning (when my pain is the worst), I get the worst period poops, my legs feel numb, I’ve passed out several times and it’s only gotten worse. Anemia. I’m in pain all the time not just on my period. 
The last few months, the week before my period I get major cramps, I’ve thrown up and gotten the worst poops, like diarrhea and constantly having to go to the bathroom or I might poop my self. 
Sorry if it’s tmi but it’s so bad I’m crying, it feels like I’m pooping out my uterus and bowels. I lost a lot of weight also, I’m already really skinny and have issues eating cause of my symptoms, so that mentally hurt. I thought I had a uti and got tested, the test was negative. I also have other issues but these are my main symptoms.

I also have factor 5 Leiden, which is an inherited blood clotting disorder. Which my  gyno (who is so nice btw, love her) told me greatly limits the medication I can use. She wants me to try progesterone (if anyone has used it I’d appreciate any advice) but I’m getting my blood tested first to see what’s safe for me to take. 

She also said the only real solid way I can be diagnosed with Adeno or Endo is surgery. She said it’s a possibility I have Endo (she was actually suprised it didn’t show up on the mri) but doesn’t want to put me through unnecessary surgery because of my clotting disorder. 

Also a side note I did change my diet which has helped lessen the severity of my symptoms but I’m still in a lot of pain. 

I gave up coffee/milk and drink tea in the morning before I eat anything. Drinking less cold drinks cause that apparently makes my period clotting worse. I drink more smoothies and am eating more nuts, more fiber in general and less processed sugars. 
Also I’m trying castor oil packs but it’s still really early to say if it’s doing anything.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hpb8km/why\_isnt\_the\_lagom\_casa\_more\_widely\_recommended/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hpb8km/why_isnt_the_lagom_casa_more_widely_recommended/)

My Option-O Lagom Casa arrived last week to replace the DF64 Gen 2 that has annoyed me so much for the half a year I've owned it. It is an immediate improvement in pretty much every aspect.

My biggest complaint was consistency. While I never enjoyed the DF64 for filter coffee, I did use it occasionally when I was feeling lazy. I also roast coffee and sometimes used it to grind quickly at coarse settings to do cuppings. If I went from 10 to 50 back to 10, the 10 would not behave the same the second time. I'm pretty sure this is due to the rubber feet and flimsy wave spring that place tension on the upper burr, and think it's really bad design to use a cheap, imprecise solution on the part that requires the most precise tolerances.

The Casa is the polar opposite. If I go from espresso to filter, back to espresso, my shot time is exactly the same. This has been a revelation.

Cleanliness: the Casa is SO clean. I've stopped doing RDT because it's not necessary, and I've never had more than 0.1g of retention using the little clicker. Usually the weight out is exactly what I put in, which is kind of crazy. The DF64 would blow fines everywhere when I used the bellows, which would also make a static-y mess on the chute. And you have to use the bellows to clear each grind, plus clean out that chute regularly to prevent clogging.

Taste: this was a pleasant surprise. I was hoping for ""just as good"" as the flat burrs because the burr ecosystem is by far the best part of the DF64 (and to be fair it is fantastic). But to me this tastes better. The grind quality is visually extremely consistent. For espresso (mostly light roast), the Casa gives me a little less body than the DF64 DLC burrs but excellent clarity, sweetness, and balanced shots. Even when my dialling is off, the taste is pretty yummy. It's a lovely flavour profile. For filter though, this thing shines. Bright, sweet, juicy, balanced cups that are often a bit more satisfying than my ZP6's tea-like results. It's kind of the flavour profile I was hoping for from the SSP Lab Sweet v3 burrs, but those did not work well on my DF64 at all.

Workflow: improved dramatically with no RDT, clean clicker, and the auto-stop is a really nice touch that I didn't think I'd appreciate as much as I do.

The build quality is obviously far superior. It is much quieter, smaller, and lighter too.

I feel like I have good choices now. I still have my JX-Pro (which I've had and enjoyed for years) and my ZP6, which I love and rate very highly. Between the three grinders, I can choose depending on the bean between traditional, clinical tea-like clarity, and the Casa, which is somewhere in between (though closer to the ZP6).

Great grinder and an absolute steal for the price.

Edit: two things to add. It's nice to have a grinder that works great out of the box, without having to spend 2 hours aligning the burrs before using it. Second, my only complaint about the Casa so far is occasionally a tiny piece of bean will come popcorning out of the top during grinding. A cover would have been nice to prevent this, but most of the time it is not necessary.",10,1740460411.0,espresso,8,1.0,False

Additionally, when I have a lot to study, I try to study in the morning, but I find the time insufficient because my class starts at 7:30 AM, and I need to leave by 5:30 AM.

I opted to take it at night since I can’t afford to be unproductive for 3-4 hours during the day.

1ixn3sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ixn3sx/i_dont_feel_worthy_of_my_partners_love/,I don’t feel worthy of my partners love.,"I’m 31 and still feel extremely insecure. Especially next to my partner. 

For context, I dropped out of my engineering degree over a decade now and haven’t had a steady job during the entirety of my 20s (though I opted for going overseas and living a relatively nomadic life for most of it), I am barely making ends meet, still have no idea what I want to do with my life, definitely don’t have any savings or retirement funds aside, and am going back to school to start an undergrad in the fall of this year at 32 years old. 

My partner is a doctor, has been working for Doctors Without Borders doing missions in war zones for the past 10 years, he makes more money in one on-call shift at home than I do in 2 weeks of full time work. He takes 6 months of the year off, sails for months to Antarctica, bike packs across Alaska, flys to Paris for the weekend to see a band he likes, etc. The only job he’s ever had, aside from working at a computer shop once a week in his senior year of high school, has been a doctor. He comes from money and aside from the stress of his job, his life is lavish. 

I grew up in a low-income, multiple divorce, toxic household with 7 kids and parents with severe mental health issues. I feel like Ive been fighting to stay afloat my entire life. 

He is genuinely an incredible man, he acknowledged the privilege he comes from and does his part to give back to the world. Of course there is no fault to anyone that grows up in a loving, well-off family and that is what everyone hopes for. And frankly is what creates people like himself that become Doctors and do well for the world. 

I am struggling to feel adequate for him even though he does nothing to make me feel that way. He pays for almost everything, I tend to buy small things like coffees. I have pretty well accomplished nothing in my adult life. He says he likes my moral compass, that I to against the status quo of life despite being somewhat of an intellect, that I’m fun to be around, that I’m interesting because I’ve worked so many different jobs and have experience the world in a different way than most…. But to me it’s not enough. I don’t feel like I can uplift him or improve his life in anyway, like he already has it all figured out and I’m just fun to be around - which again doesn’t feel enough. My lack of resources and flexible makes me feel like a burden. His x is a full time author, his friends work for the UN, are fighting diseases, etc and are well accomplished and fully excelling in their lives. 

I know I’m rambling a bit and I’m being outwardly negative, but I’m spiralling. 

He’s just such a good guy and I want this relationship to work. I just can’t seem to shake it off, which is inevitable affect it. 

TLDR: I feel insecure in generally, especially next to my partner. He’s ultra wealthy, has a successful careeer and lives a very flexible lifestyle. I’m poor and insecure and have no career. I want to make the relationship work but I’m always feeling back for myself. ",1,1740459490.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

""Hey kid how have you been?""

""I've been better Mr Jacobs, I was actually thinking about popping by if you're free?"" While I talked I was in the midst of picking him out a new bat just a spare since he was getting a bit of use out of the old one based off that crack.

""Good to hear, I figured you should know somebody's looking for you. Some chump named Alex, the kid looked nervous and damn near exhausted.""

""Really? I'll deal with it. How are things going with you? Your hip still giving you trouble?""

""Every now and then, but I can manage. My usual cocktail of pain pills and spite is still working.""

We shared a chuckle, see you around sometime kid. I would say stay out of trouble but better yet always remember how to get yourself out.

""Speak like a gentleman, and when that doesn't work- Left and right are good backup."" we say in unison.

I went to another store and picked out a spare cane as well, before taking the bus to my old neighborhood. I was heading toward my old apartment building when someone called out to me.

Jared! I recognized the voice and then I felt a hand on my shoulder. I scowled and tensed ready to drive the elbow of my free arm into the gut of the person behind me. They approached me from my left, I turned to see Alex standing beside me. He jumped back a bit seeing my expression.

""It's just me."" His lips curving into a small smile. He looked tired, there were bags under his eyes and he had a scar on his cheek. We got off to the side, standing in front of a long abandoned building that used to be a corner store.

""What do you want?""

""I want to talk, I haven't seen you in 6 months.""

""A little late don't you think?""

""Please? We used to be friends.""

"" that's your fault and we know exactly why."" I said through gritted teeth.

Alex winced, ""I know, please talk to me just once.""

""Why? You couldn't give a damn enough to detach yourself from my ex-girlfriend over the last 6 months to see what happened to your supposed best friend but now you want to bug me and ask questions?""

""I know I'm out of line, and I hate myself for what we- I did to you but I want to apologize for real and find out where you were not as a superhero but as your former best friend trying to fix things.""

""It's pretty late for that.""

""Please, we're both worried."" Alex begged 

I should tell him to f*** off, I know I should. The words are on the tip of my tongue, but then I thought of the conversation I had with Mr Jacobs.

_Some chump named Alex is looking for you_

""Fine, Old Bean coffee shop tomorrow 3:00 p.m. your one and only chance.""

""Okay, th-

""Don't."" I kept walking and didn't look back.

The building looked a little worse for wear but still standing. Four stories windows on each side. Dual entrance. I went up to the door on the left and rang the one labeled Jacobs. The door chimed and I pushed it open with my free hand before heading up the steps to the second floor stopping in front of his door and knocking.

""Who's there?""

""Jared.""

I heard footsteps approach the door and then I heard the sound of the chain and the lock being undone. Mr Jacobs open the door slowly peeking through the crack before opening it wider revealing himself and his pistol in his free hand. He smiled slyly and put it away upon seeing that it was actually me.

""Good to see your kid, get your butt in here.""

I walked inside headed down the hallway to the living room, the walls decorated with pictures of Mr Jacob on adventures with his family. We settled in living room, I sat on the sofa while he sounded an armchair facing the doorway. His box TV was down low and the ceiling to floor length curtains were tied in bows allowing natural light to illuminate the room.

""I wanted to get you a couple things to pay you back for hanging on to my stuff when I went out of town suddenly.""

""Free stuff is free stuff but for the record payback isn't necessary, I figured something was up you've never been one to take spontaneous vacations without at least letting the landlord know. I didn't mind holding onto your stuff until you hopefully turned up or news about you did.""

""I appreciate it, I'm sure you know that it wasn't a vacation that I was on.""

“I figured it wasn't, no vacation that went the way it was supposed to results in you dumpster diving for clothes.”

""How did you know?""

Mr Jacob chuckled ""There was another guy's name written on the tag of your shirt.”

I laughed, something I hadn't done in months. It was nice. Now it was time to be honest. “I remember you joked about needing a few beers when I got ready to explain where I was.”

“Go for it.” he encouraged leaning over in curiosity.

Somebody kidnapped me, whoever experimented on me but I'm not sure why.

""That doesn't sound like a picnic but I'm guessing you're going to get to the bottom of it?”

""Yes but I need help from an acquaintance that I didn't end things on the best of terms with.""

""This ""Alex"" guy I'm guessing?""

""Yeah, I'm going to meet him for coffee tomorrow.""

Jacob nodded. “Sounds iffy, can you trust this guy?”

“ I doubt it but he's my only reliable source of leads right now.”

“If you need a hand, I've got your back 24/7 just call me.”

""Thanks, also I appreciate that you didn't give away my name to him, he's an old acquaintance that's a little late to the party if you catch my drift. After tomorrow he shouldn't be bothering you again though.""

“No problem, I know how to handle random people poking around.”

 “ as a gesture of gratitude I brought gifts.""

Jacob chuckled ""You should have led with that."" he joked

I chuckled as I handed Jacob the metal bat first. Mr Jacobs stood up and headed to the hallway giving the bad a few practice swings before gripping the hilt and lightly slapping the end against his palm. “Very nice, lightweight, sturdy and able to give someone a concussion with one good swing.""

""I'm glad you like it. I got you a spare cane too.""

Mr Jacobs leaned the bat against the wall before accepting the Cane.

""Nice, let me test it out."" Mr Jacobs raised the Cane into the air with his right hand. Next he loosened his grip so his hand slid halfway down before spinning it between his fingers and swinging it in a downward-arc before straightening up and swing it to his right before trading hands and repeating the motion with his left. ""Oh this will do the job quite nicely.""

"" I'm glad you like it. I figured you'd want one that would knock the hell out of someone if necessary, especially living around here.""

Mr Jacob patted my shoulder ""A man after my own heart."" We hung out a little while longer and then I headed home. 

The next day after work I headed to the Old Bean. The familiar scent of cocoa greeting me as I walk through the door and stepped in line.

""Table for two please.""

""Right away sir."" The Barista brought me to a table near the window. I checked my watch 2:56 p.m. while I waited I checked the news on my phone. The headline of a particular article caught my eye.

""Three Formally Missing People turn up in the city reunited with their families."" My mind flashed back to the laboratory then to the memory that I swiped from the doctor of that Bloody cell.

A total of three people have returned to the city, but the mystery behind their disappearance still raises questions with the police.

They're bloody clothes and apparent amnesia coupled with their disappearances suggests a darker motive but the police chief has promised to investigate this case and bring all criminals found to Justice 

""Sure."" I muttered sarcastically.

I heard the door chime as it opened and I spotted Alex come in and walk up to the podium. The lady behind it led him to the table and left us to look over the menu. The bags under Alex's eyes had gotten deeper and his eyes were slightly bloodshot this time.

""Thanks for meeting with me.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Don't thank me, I agreed to do this to get you off my back I don't need you putting my former neighbors in danger.""

""Sorry, I wasn't sure where else to start.""

There was a beat of silence between us, Alex couldn't bear to look me in the eye.

What happened to you? Where were you? Alex said finally.

""Why do you suddenly care now? You didn't care 4 months ago?""

""I'm sorry okay? I should have been a better friend before and after you disappeared.""

No shit, Sherlock but you still didn't answer my question. Why are you suddenly so curious?

Alex looked like you wanted to say more but he was biting his tongue.

""I'm leaving. I don't have time for this crap."" I stood up and was trying to get the attention of the waitress when he spoke:

""More people besides you have went missing but you're the first person to turn up, so please tell me what happened, whatever you remember.""

“Fine and all cards on the table, I'm trying to get information as well to figure out what was the point of what happened to me. I got kidnapped by some doctor Who experimented on me for over 4 months until I freed myself and escaped and got back home using one of their planes.""

""So you're the one who left that plane in the junkyard a couple owns over?

""Yes.""

""Okay things are starting to connect here, there's been talk on the news about three formerly missing people returning to their families in bloody rags and suffering from amnesia. I suspect you might be the fourth.""

"" I think you're right for now.""

""But how did you retain your memories of the incident?""

I don't know- we were cut off by the barista asking for our orders.

I apologized for before and picked what I wanted while Alex took a second to decide. Once the barista left we continued our conversation:

""I don't know how I did it but I could feel him taking my memories. They flashed through my mind like pictures. Resisting him seemed to work and I even seemed to obtain some of his memories. Those missing people were kept in a cell. The commotion I caused freed myself must have created an opportunity for them to free themselves.

Alex nodded. ""It can't be a coincidence that all the people came from this area.""

""I doubt it, was there a pattern to the kidnappings?""

""No the incidents were sprinkled all throughout the city.""

""Okay, maybe it was done like that so a pattern would not be easily formed but they did make it a habit of capturing people from this city specifically.""

Alex was quiet for a moment. I looked up and he had a troubled look on his face.

""You look like you figure something out.""

""It's just a theory but what if the connecting factors Is Us? What if along with experimentation one of the reasons for the kidnappings sprinkled throughout the city was to get our attention?""

""I think you hit the nail on the head, because while he was experimenting on me he kept asking what both you and Valkyries secret identities were. I never told him but he knew other important details.""

Alex was tense for a second but relaxed upon me revealing that I didn't tell their secret. I struggled to keep my face neutral thanks to the tinge of annoyance that I felt. 

""He knew about me formerly being friends with you and my previous relationship with Valkyrie. He attempted to use that to empathize with me.""

 I noticed Alex's eyes flicked to the table when I said the word ""formerly"" I didn't acknowledge it. He may not want to admit it but I'm not ashamed to admit I'm using this meeting to gather information not rebuild a friendship.

Alex was quiet for a moment while he absorbed the information. Thank you, he said softly.

""Don't thank me, like I told you Sasha 6 months ago. I'm keeping your secrets because it's the right thing to do nothing more. All I'm trying to do today is get information.""

""Of course, I was wondering if I could ask you for one more favor.""

""You're pushing it Alex, I already agreed to meet with you, that's more than I should have done.""

""Please, it's not for me.""

I narrowed my eyes ""But you're the one asking? What are you up to?""

""I need you to come with me to show Valkyrie you're back.""

""Why can't you tell her?""

.....She's not talking to me.""

""That's a shame."" I sneered.

""She has good reason, I tried to convince her to stop looking for you."" He said in a regretful whisper.",2,1740459400.0,WritingPrompts,1,0.75,False

I recently went out on my first date, well it was not really a date per say. Just two good friends meeting for coffee on paper. But really it was just a meet up to get to know eachother, and to see if we want to pursue eachother. To start off, We both come from a very conservative sort of background. it's seen as immoral for a girl and boy to go out together unless they're married or planning to. Hence we met in secrecy without telling anyone. So we meet, i greet her. She greets me. Then we go off to have coffee, we order two espresso's, and start talking about ourselves, our families and our lives. Since it was the first time I had been alone with a girl, it was very awkward. We both shared the feeling. But we did still talk, turning the awkwardness into a topic of discussion itself, why we're like this, how we've never done this before and all that. While we're talking our coffee arrives. We sip it and it's the worst coffee we have ever had. So we quickly tell the waiter to get us something else. So he turns the espressos into a cold coffee. Which turned out to also he horrible. We tried to drink it. But couldn't. It also had some icecream that I had her taste by my hand. It was okay. So anyway date(or meetup) went well imo. Apart from the bad coffee. I drop her off. And that's that. But when I text her a few hours later. There was a problem, apparently her friend saw her and told her brother. Which was a problem as her brother scolded her, and threatened to take away her phone and tell their parents. Now that isn't really what I am mad about. That sort of thing happens a lot in our country. But the problem is apparently the friend that told her brother was her 'bestfriend' according to her. Now this guy is a total jackass. He got rejected by her and was still friends with her. He is controlling and insecure and tells her you don't need any friends except me. He was good friends with her family and her brother hence he could blackmail her into not having any other male friends. So i hear all of this and tell her. Her so called 'bestfriend' is the problem. He's just mad he got rejected and is trying to force you into being with him. And yet she refuses to listen. She tells me, he's still her good friend and they have been friends for 4 years, so she still has to deal with him. Like this guy, doesn't even want anyone to even be friends with her, she had always told me that she had no friends and was lonely. And now I understand why, because her incel friend wont allow her. So i am pretty livid about this and tell her to stop being friends with him. But she refuses. So now here we are. I think she's in a really bad spot, I don't want to get mad at her, she's a really nice girl. And I want the best for her, it's not even about wanting to date her anymore, i just want her to be happy,  what might I even do? ",1,1740458984.0,RelationshipIndia,5,1.0,False

###Cost breakdown

Excluding airfare, the whole week cost us about 5,700 USD, broken down into:

* $2,700 on lodging
* $1,900 on experiences ($100 of which was tips, but I might be underestimating this a bit because I didn't keep good records of all of them)
* $700 on transportation ($400 in city-to-city shuttles, $150 on Ubers and shuttles in LF, $150 on taxis in MV)
* $400 on food
* $80 on souvenirs

We obviously did not go the cheapest route. We had 2-3 paid activities pretty much every day, our lodging got a little upscale, and because both the LF and MV places were ~20 minutes from the city center, we had to pay more for the Ubers/taxis. We also made a mistake getting a shuttle from a tour company directly to our hotel for an extra $60 on the first day, before we realized how easy Uber is in LF. That could have saved us at least $50.

###Lodging

* 1 night in San Jose at the **Adventure Inn** ($150). We arrived around 10 PM and left the next morning, so not much to say. Breakfast was nice, but it’s cooked to order so takes a little bit of time. We were rushing to our shuttle.

* 4 nights in La Fortuna at **Eden Organic Farm & Bungalows** ($1,100). Great place, very comfortable, nice porch, pretty bathroom. It’s more AirBNB style than a hotel, so the front desk of the farm closes at 5 PM (though of course you can message them on WhatsApp whenever, and I saw them accommodate a late arrival). Perhaps not suited for the very arachnophobic, as an organic farm. We saw a lot many spiders on the night hike here, and a fucking massive one on our bedroom ceiling every night that I just forced myself to ignore. Admittedly the massive one did seem to help the cabin stay free of other bugs!

* 3 nights in Monteverde at **Amalú**'s Glass Cabin 2.0 ($1,400). This was a splurge for sure. It’s a gorgeous place, amazing view from a floor-to-ceiling window with a telescope. It’s got about every amenity you could dream of outside of a spa. The curtains are a giant projector screen so you can log in and watch movies. They left ample breakfast and snacks. There's a hot tub outside and a jacuzzi bath inside.

###Transportation

* SJO > LF shuttled used [Arenal Rides](https://arenalrides.com/) ($180 because of our away-from-town location), LF > MV used [Aventuras El Lago’s Jeep Boat Jeep](https://aventurasellago.com/) ($60), MV > SJO used [Transportation In Costa Rica](https://www.transportationincostarica.com) ($150)

* Within La Fortuna, Ubers were super easy and pretty cheap. About $6-8 per ride.

* Within Monteverde, we had to use taxis and it got expensive, ranging from $12-40 depending on where we were going and probably how nice the taxi driver was lol. I see a lot of advice saying you should make them use the meter, but we did not have any luck (see my post history for some frustration). We just had to accept paying the gringa prices (and probably staying at Amalú in particular didn't help -- several drivers commented on how pricy it was).

###Activities: La Fortuna

* Coffee/Chocolate Tour from Eden Organic Farms. Did this right as we arrived, waiting for our room to be ready (we arrived early). No idea how it compares to any of the many similar tours, but it was fun! We got to participate in making coffee and chocolates. Our guide was very engaging and funny.

* Bogarin Trail sloth tour. Great, saw something like 5 adults sloths, two of which were carrying babies, and other animals. There’s a pond in front with fruit hanging out that attracts many beautiful birds, including toucans.

* [Full-day tour from 7 Tours](https://seventours.com/tour/arenal-one-day). It was good for a big group tour, but the Mistico Hanging Bridges in particular would have been better with a smaller group. We were 16, so I feel obligated to not spend too long at my turn on the telescope, and if you end up at the back of the group it’s hard to hear. At the waterfall, they just let you disperse and meet up at a specific time. It seemed like we took the Mirador El Silencio trail backwards from other groups, which was cool. Most of the way was very empty except our group.

* [EcoCenter Denaus Night Hike](https://www.ecocentrodanaus.com/en/tour-nocturno). My favorite night hike of three. We saw a ton of wildlife, ranging from insects to olingos and caiman 

* [Hike Rio Celeste Waterfall with Lunch & Swimming time](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/874081). Beautiful! A little more strenuous hike (we lagged behind).

* Night Hike at Eden Organic Farms. Funnily enough we had the same tour guide as the Rio Celeste hike earlier in the day. Didn’t see any larger animals (although apparently there have been sloths there), but we saw a lot of bugs and frogs. Our guide also waded into a river trying to figure out what something was – it turned out to be a water opossum and although we couldn’t really see it, he took some good photos and emailed them to us.

* Horseback riding with Go Adventures. We actually booked through [this AirBNB link](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/2257749) and didn’t realize it was with [Go Adventures](https://goadventurepark.com/shortcode-tours/horseback-riding/). This was my favorite of three time we went horseback riding because I happened to get a fast horse, we had a small group of 5 people, the tour guide was very funny and told us a lot about the area, and the trail we chose had us actually ride into a river. I wish I’d known to bring an extra pair of socks, though!

* Tabacón. Yeah, we went with the super expensive hot springs – it was my mom’s birthday! I haven’t seen the other hot springs to compare but it was soooooo lovely. We were giggling over how magical it felt! It helped that it was not at all overcrowded. I don’t know if they just have a limited number of tickets available each day to make sure it stays quiet, or if we came on a slow day, but we were there for at least four hours and I did not want to leave.

###Activities: Monteverde

* [Butterfly Garden](https://www.monteverdebutterflygardens.com/). Had a cute tour run by an intern who was very excited about the bugs. We started by seeing some bugs in terrariums: a few different types of tarantulas, stick insects, a big cockroach, scorpions. She talked about each one, let us ask as many questions as we wanted. Then moved on to the three or four different enclosed butterfly gardens, for different regions.

* [Night Hike with Felix](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/3812961) in the Monteverde Wildlife Refuge (not cloud forest). Saw some good sleeping birds, a snake, and a number of bugs.

* Santa Elena Reserve guided tour - This was the one experience we had bad weather for. It was raining the whole time, and two of our six-person group actually turned back. The 30 minute start in the orchid garden felt excessive (read: boring), but the rest of it was good. Not much big wildlife, but we found some interesting bugs including three orange-kneed tarantulas and a couple of insects that had been infected with cordyceps!

* 100% Aventura zipline canopy tour. Fun! There are three really long ziplines (two superman style, if weather allows) and a tarzan swing, the latter of which gave me a hell of an adrenaline rush (my mom skipped that one).

* El Tigre Waterfalls hike. If you do the zipline bike option, this is mostly downhill, so it was relatively easy. Good views, there are some wobbly bridges to cross one-at-a-time. One of the waterfalls especially you could get really up close to, and I think swim if you wanted. We did the horse option instead of ATV – it was all right. No guide talking about anything, just a means of transportation.

* [Monteverde Equus Farms horseback riding](https://monteverdeequusfarm.com/). My mom liked this horseback riding experience best because as someone with a good amount of experience, she got given a really good horse and was at the front. Mine was more middle-of-the-pack, so the experience wasn’t as exciting. There’s no guide giving information (although she chatted with the guides at the front). A lot of the trail is single-file so it’s a little hard to hold a conversation with others. But there were beautiful views!

###Dining

* The only notable recommendation for food I want to make is for [Soda/Restaurant Rodriguez](https://www.facebook.com/Reservationshostelarenalfortuna1/). It’s a very unique environment, like a treehouse in someone’s backyard. There are upstairs and downstairs areas and domestic animals roaming around. Our upstairs nook got visited by a dog (begging) and a cat (conniving) who were both super friendly, but downstairs there were at least two more dogs, at least one more cat, and the person who recommended this place to us said she saw a pig.

###Spanish

I had some elementary travel Spanish mostly from about 2 months of DuoLingo preceding the trip (and knowing French helped). I was kind of shocked at how far it got me. You should be able to get by fine in LF especially with English only, but I think it enriched the experience to be able to chat a little to the taxi drivers and at some restaurants in Spanish, weak as it was. Taxi drivers always claimed to know only a little English, although I think they probably all had better English than my Spanish! Even so, a lot of them seemed to enjoy talking in Spanish with me anyway. The taxi company operators in Monteverde claimed to not speak any English (straight up ""no"" instead of ""a little""), but given how touristy it is, I feel like they might still know enough to get the basic order done. I didn't try.

###Final Thoughts

We went in mid-February, and had fantastic weather for the most part. There was one heavy downpour while we were in our hotel for the evening, and one cloud forest hike was in the rain, but aside from that we only got occasional sprinkles.

A funny thing we noticed: Of the people we discussed it with, almost 100% of US Americans had rented a car and 100% of non-US people had not rented a car. Obviously we didn't ask everybody, but there might be a trend there.

This is probably the best vacation I’ve ever taken. I normally travel more frugally, but we decided to live large this time. You can definitely save money by booking cheaper accommodations in town, and not doing as many guided tours if you’re happy to just enjoy the hikes. I can't wait to come back and visit the coasts!",3,1740458887.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,0.8,False

**Genre:** Time management game like Diner Dash/Delicious Emily’s etc., except I think it wasn’t as fast paced.

**Estimated year of release:** Anywhere from 2005-2015 or something?

**Graphics/art style:** Very dull, bland colors. Reminds me of a trailer park or a dusty/dingy old-fashioned diner. Mostly browns and tans and muted tones. Character art was not at all cutesy.. Kind of thinking King of the Hill artstyle/designs but more cartoony? Lmao. Foggy memory.

**Notable characters:** Not really. I remember customer expressions being like 😐.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** You had to prep food, which looked pretty simple/bland, and also provide a drink. I think steak was a food option and the drinks were a cardboard coffee cup or (nondescript) Coke/Sprite. The whole diner was viewed by scrolling sideways/couldn’t all be seen at once.

**Other details:** The thing I remember best was that you could tell that drinks were ready to be trashed when the can/cup abruptly became crumpled at the customer’s table. I think often finished drinks before food, and there were never more than like 4 customers at a time or something?

Good idea to call  her and try to explain myself and win her back? or did I destroy any chance of it ever happening?,"Lets start this post off by saying this is gonna be a long confusing tale. one I can't wrap my head around even now. sorry for grammer lol

so it all started when one of my close friends started dating a girl and things were getting pretty serious.serious enough to where she started trying to set me up with one of her friends. \*for clarification, everyone in this story is an acquaintance of friend that I may know because we all belong to the same church/community\* so I knew of that friend we'll call her Grace. Now Grace was her best friend and she saw me and thought I was cute. so I decided I'll go for It and we did. I got Graces instagram from her and we instantly hit it off, we texted for days and exchanged numbers.finally I decided we should meet up for a study date. safe to say we didn't study much that day. I felt this instant fairytale like connection to her. we loved the same things and we had the same ideas about everything. fast forward a week after this day, there was a huge university event, we were both in attendance. she was with her friends and I was with mine. so I texted her to come hangout and she said yes so I walked to pick her up from where she was (across the park). while we were walking back someone from the community saw us together(not important now but will be in future.) Grace seemed off the whole day, checking her phone and acting all anxious, I didn't wanna be nosy and pry since we only known each other for a bit so I let it go. so a couple hours later after the function when everyone (including grace) went home I was getting spam calls from a random number. literally like 11 missed calls. so I answer and its a guy, lets call him Dick, the acquaintance from earlier wanting to know where grace was and if she was still with me.  I told him that he should call her if he wants to know because at that point I didn't know that he had seen me with her. he proceeds to tell me that her phone is not answering and he can't reach her and he needs to talk to her about an important project coming up in class.(its literally like 1AM at this moment) so I told him that she went home.after that awkward exchange he proceeds to tell me ""dude call me when you get home ok, I need to talk to you about something."" now I thought that that was weird because I am an acquaintance of his, I only talk to him if I run into him in the hall. so I called him when I got home. he proceeded to grill me asking me if me and grace were together and began to demand to know the answer. I told him it was none of his business and that he has no right asking a question like that. he then starts telling me about how he used to date Grace and the ""did things "" together. I stopped the conversation there because it was getting a little inappropriate and he began begging me not to tell her about the conversation we had. he wouldn't get off the phone until I promised so I did.

I met with grace the day after for a coffee/ study date and told her what had happened. she started balling her eyes out like crazy. she started telling me how Dick was a talking stage that went bad and he's been stalking her ever since. he's blocked but he gets random numbers calling her and texting her demanding to know where she is and who she's with.(this is why she wa upset at the park. he was sending her paragraphs and spam calling her demanding answers to his questions.) he shows up to her classes and waits for her outside.he parks his car right next to hers and with for her to leave. he was stalking her and she's threatened to call the police and campus security multiple times because of him. of course as anyone would I was shocked to find out that this perfect girl I just met comes with a crazy ex stalker man.

pause the story for a minute to tell you about myself. I am an unathletic man  with severe anxiety who was studying for grad school exams when this was all happening. dick was a masters student 1 year older who frequents the gym and has arms the size of my head. he's also not smart, as in he's idiotic enough to possibly hurt me because im talking to her.

so now I have my guard up at all times, my anxiety is going through the roof at school scared that im gonna run into him or he's gonna run into her. on top of that he's calling me now every day demanding to know what we did or asking if  I told her about the conversation we had. it got to the point were he would call every other hour and everytime the phone rang id have a mini panic attack.

I couldn't study and I wasn't comfortable in school or with her or anything because of Dick. so I talked to my best friends dad about some advice. he told me that men like dick a very unpredictable and now even if you and grace are just getting to know each other, in his mind you're dating and bragging about it to his face. he said this type of man is really dangerous and he might hurt you or try to intimidate you because you're ""taking his girl"" or you're in his territory. He said best thing to do now is focus on your school and get away from this situation because it is none of your Buisness.

long story short I told her what my friends dad said and he was sad obviously but she said ""I totally understand. I didn't want you to get dragged into all of this anyway im so sorry etc"" so it was over but I expressed to her that I had feeling for her and that I wanted to try when the problem is fixed.

her best friend, my boys girl proceeded to call me and yell at me saying I left her when she needed someone most, and that she's gonna feel like I abandoned her and that I didn't stick up for her. \*also it may or may not be important to note that my boy broke up with the best friend  a couple months after this\*

but its not my responsibility. I had my safety and future to think about.

but im telling you all. at least from my side it was a feeling like ive never felt before. IDK why I still think about her now. ive seen her multiple times around campus but she could barley look at me. but I feel like I owe it to her and myself to call her and tell her I regret leaving and that I want to try.but also I don't know if that's the right thing to do. There will be many issues with my boys and the ex best friend. If she got over the whole situation, I don't wanna rehash old memories. I guess my question is what do you think my next step should be? How do I get past it/move on?

This is a long story and I don't know how much is really connected, but I have spent the last 8 years trying to find answers, so I am putting it all out there in a final hail mary.

I have a normal history of mental illness from childhood (anxiety, depression, maybe 5 panic attacks total as a teenager there was an underlying reasoning for all of them such as traveling or in crowded spaces). When I got to college, my freshman year was completely normal - I was a bit of a drinker for sure and I would vape nicotine and the only medication I was on was birth control that I was on for a year. The summer going into my sophomore year of college, I woke up one morning and couldn't hear out of my ear and had shooting pain down that side of my neck. I went to an ENT and the doctors had no idea what was wrong or why it had happened, but they said all they could see was my inner ear was completely swollen. They prescribed me prednisone (I can't remember the dosage) to take for maybe a week or 2. The next morning before I started taking the prednisone, my ear felt better and I could hear, but I decided to take the medication anyway.

While I was taking the prednisone, I felt totally fine - no feelings of anxiety which I know is very common. A couple of weeks after stopping the prednisone, I flew to Europe and I remember having some inner ear pain due to the pressure. While I was on that trip, I experienced depersonalization/derealization for the first time, which was extremely confusing to me. There was no lifestyle changes, stressors, increased anxiety/depression, or anything else that I can point to that would lead to me feeling this way. After coming home from that trip, I noticed that every once in a while I would get that feeling again. They never told me what was wrong with my ear, but I didn't really have any issues after that. Every once in a while I'd get some shooting pain down my neck but nothing crazy.

About a month later, I was at my college and woke up that morning and went to a friends house. I drank the night before but didn't feel especially hungover - again no added trauma, stressor, lifestyle change. All of a sudden at the snap of a finger, everything changed. I had my first severe panic attack that had racing thoughts, suicidal ideation, extreme derealization, and of course panic. I had never in my life, even in my previous panic attacks, felt anything close to this, I literally thought I was dying. I was having extreme intrusive suicidal ideation, but I knew I didn't want to die. To make it worse, these panic attacks would last 12-14 hours straight - no relief. I have never been the same. I remember experiencing brain fog so bad that at one point I couldn't remember my own name. I got MRIs and scans of my brain which led to them saying I may have vestibular migraines. They put me on amitriptyline, but it just gave me suicidal ideation and brought out severe OCD. After this happened, I also became extremely sensitive to any stimulant - decaf coffee, sometimes chocolate that's too rich, decaf soda all lead to anxiety. I cut out nicotine and got a little better, for a few years. I continued to drink and felt okay, I would have normal levels of hangxiety but nothing crazy. I also stopped the birth control, just in case this had any effects.

Fast forward 8 years later, I still continue to feel the extreme derealization DAILY from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep there is no relief. I have been in therapy consistently, I have tried multiple SSRIs that make it extremely worse, and last year, I had another flare up where I was having the severe 12 hour long panic attacks again. I've cut out alcohol and nicotine and although I don't have the 12-hour long panic attacks, I still haven't gotten better and I still have the mental health concerns. It's important to note again that I don't have severe or really any bad trauma, so it isn't common to have severe depersonalization/derealization. Now, if I have 2 drinks of alcohol, I throw up all day the next day and have severe suicidal ideation and derealization.

To add some other symptoms: At around 21 years old, I began having stomach pains that mimic an ulcer. I would have pain if I hadn't eaten or if I ate certain foods, specifically hot liquids like soup, caffeine, etc (alcohol would only bother me the next day never as I was drinking). The only relief was throwing up and I would throw up bile or spit up, sometimes just the act of dry heaving would help. I've been to many gastros and gotten many tests, all no results. Even though there are specific foods that trigger it, the doctors just said I have anxiety. I also have fatigue, more than I used to have when I was younger. I've also noticed lately that there are hormonal changes like my hair growing back quicker than usual. I also get headaches/itchy brain I don't know how to explain. I get dizziness and motion sickness I've never had before. I'm sure there's more symptoms that I can't think of at the moment.

After working with a therapist and psychiatrist for years, they suggested it may be something medical causing it because nothing has helped me, especially the derealization, and I am REALLY trying in therapy to get better. I've gotten many labs and many tests done. The one thing that did come back abnormal was my cortisol about a year or 2 ago (I've put off getting tests because I feel like every doctor has just dismissed me). I got my cortisol taken first thing when I woke up, nothing causing me anxiety, and it was mid-high 20s. I then went to an endocrinologist to get it retested. She did a full panel, but didn't do a 24-hour cortisol test, just one in the mid morning (later than the first) that came back normal. She dismissed me and told me I was fine. My therapist and psychiatrist suggested I get a full hormone panel as well as a 24 hour cortisol test. I asked my GYNO for a hormone panel and she told me to ""get off tik tok"" because I was ""too young to have hormone problems."" This obviously just made my adversion to doctors worse. I am looking to get more labs done soon, but I'm really just struggling.

Yes, a lot of my symptoms are mental health, but I know my body and I just KNOW something is off, I can feel it and I've been shouting it at doctors for years. Of course, physical symptoms can come from suffering from anxiety, but I really do believe and feel like there is a condition that is causing this mental health, not the other way around. I don't have health anxiety or hypochondria either. I have looked into cortisol and hormone levels and that seems to be the most promising avenue. I also was just recently told about CIRS.

This is definitely a lot and I apologize that it is so long, I'm just feeling absolutely hopeless about this and I want to get better. I haven't been consistent with testing and trying to figure out the issue because I've been dismissed so much. Please help!!!!",1,1740457900.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1ixmne5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1ixmne5/getting_back_to_form_a_long_journey_resumed_and_a/,Getting back to form... A long journey resumed (and a question),"Last year, I was having a blast. Final year of college, working with one of our sports teams, easy semester, countless memories made, met some great people (shout-out to two of those coaches in particular - realest people I met) - and then it was all gone just like that. Season ended, I graduated, and life hasn't gone as planned since. The self-improvement journey I was on died.


Nine months later, I'm back. I've tried to find the energy within me to resume this journey, but mentally I was hurting so bad (and honestly, it's still rough not being in college doing what I loved), I coudn't. This time around, I'm taking things slowly - my mental state now isn't allowing me to do it overnight like I could previously. Over this past week, here's where I'm at:


- Working on establishing a morning routine - this is set.

- Eating less - I skip breakfast most days, but if not that, I end up skipping lunch. Snacking isn't an issue, though my cravings are at times.

- Reading books - I geniunely couldn't bring myself to do this for months. I'm trying to read everyday, but it's tough when the time isn't there. Making good progress though!

- Improving my sleep schedule - again, work in progress, but we're getting there.


Additionally, I'm trying to enjoy using the money I earn. I don't spend it all, but I do give myself a weekly allowance to spend if I choose. I don't want to be fearful with money, and knowing how disciplined I am with it, I'm spending it whenever I see something I like or feel like giving something back to my family. I love supporting my family.


None of this is the end goal, but I'm just trying to feel good about myself as well as what I do while I go through the toughest of times. The next major steps for me are to get in shape (it'll be a lot easier once the weather is nicer), finally learn how to drive (not knowing how to drive is hurting my opportunities a lot), and rebuilding my confidence - this is gonna be difficult. 


When it comes to rebuilding my confidence, I'm thinking about getting bold: do I follow the people I knew from my team on social media? I'm somewhat socially awkward, so I wasn't tight with any of them, but I definitely had a solid working relationship with some of them - I definitely think some of them would follow back. We're college students, not co-workers, so I'm not playing with fire - I see it as an opportunity for them to know the more open side of me. I just worry the timing is off, y'know?


Regardless of what happens from here, I'm feeling really good. Internship meeting tomorrow morning and then I'm off to Barnes and Noble to try and clear my mind with a notebook, my Kindle, and maybe a coffee - I used to do that on campus all the time. I might make it my routine on my days off as I want to have a space where I can be independent - I don't get that at home. After that, it's time to figure out how I can get out my situation - I know I don't have to be where I'm at now, doing what I did last year proved that.",2,1740457880.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’m a coffee lover who is not overly hip to all the nuances. I like to go down rabbit holes on things I’m interested in, but there’s still much about “coffee nerding” I haven’t committed to yet.

I did aeropress for many years and recently got into v60 pourovers.

My wife and I are loving it, and I’ve made some good coffee. Great even.

Last night, despite always sort of shaking my head at the over the top silliness of the concept, I got some distilled water and Third Wave (medium roast).

Tried it today.
First off, I’ll say I’m a believer. It tasted richer, more bite (but in a good way, like a fine dark chocolate.)

It definitely has an improving effect.

I was mystified however, that I basically couldn’t “sense” the water on my tongue/mouth.
The coffee? Amazing flavor.
The texture of water? Didn’t exist. The closest I can allude to is it felt like having a mouth full of warm/hot coffee ‘air’.

It wasn’t bad. It was novel. But I’m not sure how I feel about it, yet.

I wonder… even after adding the Third Wave… is this just a sensation of |extremely soft| water?

Has anyone experienced similar? Should I experiment with distilled+third wave / filtered water ratio?

Not really a problem, I just kinda wanted to talk about it.

I’m seriously considering making this happen, but I need some level of commitment from those interested.

Right now, I’m thinking about a format where you’d get 50g of four different coffees (totaling 200g). Does that sound right? Should it be more? Less? More variety?

The only limitation is that I can’t run multiple subscription options at this stage it has to be a single format for now.

I wanna keep something going consistently while I try to figure out other aspects of this venture specifically the single serving style. (Really hard to do, I’m hurting from the last drop)

1ixmeaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ixmeaa/my_27m_boyfriend_25m_lets_his_parents_walk_all/,My (27M) boyfriend (25M) lets his parents walk all over us and it makes me want to pay less of the rent. What reaction would be better?,"TLDR: BFs parents have been throwing out the things I say I like, and BF has not been stopping them. So I want to pay reduced rent since I do not get to select things that go in my home.

I’ve been dating my bf for about five months now. He lives with his parents and I rent a room. Recently he bought a condo, and while his parents are not helping with a down payment or a mortgage, they are purchasing HALF of the furniture and half the appliances (thousands of dollars). They are also doing an overwhelming majority of the renovation work.
I have made it clear that if I were to move in and pay for half of the monthly mortgage, I would want to be an equal contributor to the decor of the place. I’m not living in a hotel I want to feel like I’m at home.
BF agreed.

The first occurrence came when we found that the condo had some vintage brass cutlery shaped cabinet pulls in the kitchen. We both thought they were cute and wanted to keep them (we said these things in front of both parents)

And a couple of days later while I’m at work, Mom says “no these are ugly throw them out right now” and BF follows command.

Whatever, weird mommas boy behavior, been there, overall a forgivable isolated incident.

Fast forward two weeks and it’s now a week before we move in. Most of the furniture is ready. Except the coffee table and some decor. After lots of looking I find a coffee table on FB marketplace that i LOVE. My BF agrees and he drives to go pick it up for us ( I was at work and it was his day off). When he gets it home and is cleaning it up, dad says “that’s a piece of trash I’ll buy you a new one, and he picks it up and walks it out to the trash, and orders one he chooses online. BF does not stop him. 

This no longer being an isolated incident, I believe it’s time for me to set a boundary.

When I bring these things up with him he says things like “well I told them I liked em but they wouldn’t listen to me so I just did what they said.” With a puppy dog look. 

I still want to move in with him, but I was very clear about what I wanted in a place to live. 

I understand that the parents have done a large majority of the work and invested lots of money into furniture for their kid, but my partner allowing his parents to throw away things I’ve picked is a different thing and I want to make it VERY clear that this behavior will not be tolerated.

I feel like a reasonable compromise is that instead of paying one half of the mortgage, I will let his parents decorate his house how they please, but I will only pay one third. (Roughly $600 monthly).

Even in the room I’m renting now I’m allowed to decorate my space how I please.

I realize I might sound petty and small by complaining about not having a choice about what furniture is purchased for me, but this stuff really matters to me and I made that very clear right off the bat.
And to use a cliche as a crutch, it’s about the principle.

Please help me out to see if there is another alternative I have missed, but I feel like this is a fair and measured response that will discourage 

What do you think.

1ixmdb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BelleBetting/comments/1ixmdb3/0225_belles_pick_of_the_day/,02/25: Belle's Pick of the Day 🛎️,"\-CLE Cavaliers -6.0 (-110) | 0.5 Units 



**Why This Pick?** 

I feel like everyone is waiting for Cleveland to choke – and despite being on the road after three wins in a row, I just don’t think Orlando has the chops to take down the Cavaliers (whether Darius Garland plays or not). If Garland is in, this should be an easy cover – and if he’s not, I still think Cleveland wins by at least 7. I know that they've quietly won 3 of their last 4, but if any squad is going to take the wind out of the Cavaliers’ sails, it’s not going to be the Magic. Give me Cleveland to cover.
