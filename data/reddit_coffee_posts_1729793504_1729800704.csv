1gbc1zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1gbc1zv/i_recently_realized_how_bad_sleep_apnea_is/,I recently realized how bad sleep apnea is,"Hi I’m 27 years old and in graduate school. I knew I had sleep apnea for years but I didn’t know I had it bad until I nearly flunked out of my grad program cause I couldn’t keep up with others in the program. I always thought I had a mild case of it so I thought it would be super bad cause I don’t snore loudly and sometimes I don’t snore at all. I fell asleep in every class, when I drive I fall asleep within an hour. I was always tired but it was normal to me. I never drank coffee cause I have a medical condition that prevented me from drinking it. So I literally had no pick me up. I recently found out over the summer I was born with a small throat which makes sense cause I always talked quietly. I finally had my sleep studies done and my second sleep study they put a cpap on me. It felt weird but I was kinda desperate so I didn’t mind it that much and I went to class all day after I got out and the results from that were instant I was awake all day. I asked questions and answered questions. I was actually thinking on the spot! Usually it takes me awhile to process what I’m learning but I understood all the lectures. I’m very excited to get my cpap! ",1,1729800524.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False

The reasoning for moving the kitchen to the other side of the house is that the back deck is effectively isolated from the interior sitting area. This will hopefully allow us to have a more natural flow to the outdoor space. This will also give us a proper entryway with we currently do not have.

Of course this is probably stupid, so I’m hoping you can tell us why or give suggestions.

Mine was after about 3 months out of my only relationship, I went on a date with a gal at a coffee shop. She asked if she could bring a friend as we'd never met yet which I was 100% understanding of. I get there and friend is a guy (Didn't care but for context). Turns out freind was the boyfriend and they asked if I'd join them for a three-way.

1gbby2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbby2z/my_shadow_has_grown_flesh/,My shadow has grown flesh. ,"I work very long hours as an EMT in my small town, where shifts can be as long as twelve hours or as short as eight. Most of the time, we work in very small teams and go to tame calls. We rarely get a true dire emergency call; the worst we’ve had was a bad car crash that hospitalized a few people for weeks.

Recently, my partner Rob and I responded to a call from an elderly lady who reported an intruder in her home. When we arrived, 

police were already on the scene. They had given her first aid, and we treated her for a minor cut on the back of her head and some bruising on her spine, specifically at C3 and T2.

What struck us as odd was that she had to be restrained during our care because she was frantic, almost appearing to be in a state of distress. 

She was rambling and repeating words under her breath but Rob and I had thrown it up to high stress and adrenaline.

 We couldn’t get her name initially, but the police later found her wallet, identifying her as Martha H. Karol.

Martha didn’t respond to verbal commands and was hunched over in a fetal position. Despite our efforts—me being a 240-pound guy and Rob, who is very strong and built like a brick shit house—we couldn’t get her out of that position. She had abnormal breathing and became increasingly frantic during the ride to the hospital.

Once we arrived, she finally eased up, possibly due to the tension in her muscles from adrenaline or fear. With she finally laid down on the stretcher, we examined her torso for additional bruising.

 When I lifted her shirt, I was shocked by what I saw—dark bruising, almost black, covering her body. Rob asked if it could be blood seeping from an organ, but I couldn’t tell; I had never seen bruising like that before, not even during training.

While she might have fallen during the robbery, the severity of the bruising was alarming. I understand that elderly people have fragile bodies, but this was unlike anything I had encountered.

After checking her into the ER, I was rolling the gurney through the hospital when she suddenly sprang up and grasped my arm tightly.

 It felt like she was holding on for dear life, her grip was so strong that I felt sharp pain as her fingernails dug into my forearm, drawing blood. I tried to pull away, but she felt like an anchor, and it took several nurses and doctors to help me.

Eventually, she released me, and I was rushed into an ER room for immediate medical attention. It took five stitches to repair the damage, along with strong painkillers and anesthetic. I stayed until the next evening to ensure there were no infections or any further injuries that had been done to my arm.

When I was released, Rob was there to take me home. On the drive, he mentioned something odd that made the entire call even more confusing. He said the police report confirmed there was no break-in—no broken glass, no locks picked, and no doors bashed open.

After hearing this, a deep sense of dread settled in. The injuries on the woman couldn’t have been self-inflicted unless she was severely disturbed. When Rob dropped me off, I slumped on my couch, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what had just been revealed to me.  


For the next few days, I couldn’t go anywhere since everything in town required a drive, and I didn't want to risk getting into an accident with only one functioning hand. So, I spent my time trying to do basic tasks like laundry and cleaning, which turned out to be much harder than I expected. 

Rob occasionally dropped by to check on me whenever he could, considering his work schedule, and sometimes he would bring dinner because cooking with one arm was a challenge. We’d have Chinese takeout and fortune cookies during his visits. 

However, Rob often mentioned how much he disliked getting to my house since it’s secluded, with a dirt driveway full of potholes from constant rain. Driving there at night, or even at dusk, required careful navigation.

For the next couple of weeks, I went to the hospital for check-ups to ensure my arm was healing. The doctor said it would take more time before it fully healed, and even longer before I regained any feeling in my hand.

 That night, I took a shower, and as the warm water washed over me, I couldn’t feel anything in my arm. Then, something strange happened. As I shut off the water through the steam, I noticed my shadow lagging behind my movements by a split second.



 I waved my hand, but both my hand and body seemed to lag. I felt like I was going crazy, but after slowly waving my hand for a while, I realized I was just sleep-deprived and loopy from the painkillers the hospital gave me. I went to bed, trying to push the strange experience out of my mind.



At around 3:45 in the morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water, something I often did since waking up in the middle of the night was a regular occurrence for me. As I poured the water, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.



 Living alone and in such a secluded area, there shouldn’t have been anyone there, but I swore I saw a person walk from the hallway into the laundry room.



 I almost dropped the glass in shock. Trying to stay quiet, I set the water down and crept back to my bedroom. I quickly grabbed my Glock 34 from my desk drawer and, with only one functioning arm, managed to load a round into the chamber. Crouching in the darkness with my gun in hand, I hid behind the kitchen counter, aiming at the hallway, expecting someone to appear.



After what felt like hours but was probably only five minutes, no one emerged. I cautiously got up, approached the hallway, and started clearing each room. My heart pounded as I expected someone to jump out at me at any moment, but there was no one.

 

I searched every room, but there was no sign of an intruder—no broken glass, no muddy footprints. I started to question everything. The window where I thought I saw the person was on the second floor, so how could anyone have gotten in? 



I began to feel paranoid and frantic, turning on all the lights and going over every room multiple times. I checked every window and door—no windows were broken, no locks picked, and no doors bashed in. It didn’t make sense.



 I was sure I had seen someone, it felt too real. But deep down, I knew it was probably the sleep deprivation and painkillers messing with my mind. I found myself talking out loud in the living room, still clutching my gun, feeling like I was going insane.



After what had happened that night I always made sure to go over not once but twice so that all the windows and doors were locked like always. But I had to make sure that they were locked for certain, I couldn’t risk whatever happened that night to happen again.  


 After a few days, I went on about my life doing chores around the house but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was always behind me just waiting for me to relax and somehow slip up.



 I became so much more paranoid, I never have been a true believer in stuff like aliens and anything that couldn’t be explained hell I never even believed in the paranormal or ghosts I always thought it was just a load of BS and that everything that you saw on the internet had to have been somehow faked or staged.



But after a metric ton of thinking I couldn’t just chalk what had happened that night up to some painkillers and being sleepy for God’s sake. Like I said I don’t believe in the paranormal but as I got up to go inside I noticed that I had no shadow. 

I jumped at the sight and I pranced around almost dancing in a sense as I admired how weird it was that I had no shadow it practically stopped following me and I thought that for a while that I was a vampire of some sort but I came to reality as of what happened in the shower and that night of what I saw.  

Something was going on around here, there had to have been something more to this than what I initially led on to—there just had to be. I went to bed that night and locked my bedroom door and in my room, keeping the handgun right by my side on the nightstand this time in case anything happened.

 But nothing did happen that night, and the next night, and the night after that, even during the day nothing had happened.

I awoke one morning to a seemingly beautiful day, with the sun peeking through the trees and blinds, and the sound of birds chirping nearby. 

It felt like I was in the middle of a dream. I threw on some music and happily made some half-burnt eggs and bacon, struggling to flip them properly with one hand.

 I ate on my porch, basking in the sunlight as I read the news. But then I noticed my phone wasn’t working nor would it turn on either, and that’s when I was dragged out of that peaceful reality and sucked back into my own. It wasn’t real and I realized it was indeed a dream, a dream that didn’t last, I awoke in my room to a total darkness that engulfed my room.

It was dark, too dark to even see in my room. The only thing illuminating the space was my alarm clock with the red numbers that read 3:45 again. exactly like before. As I gathered my senses, I heard the hard rain hitting the window.

 A devilish storm had broken out in the middle of the night, and I was caught in it. There had been no forecast of a storm the night before, but then again our town didn’t have the world’s best weather station either.

 “Jesus Christ,” I muttered out loud as I watched the rain and occasional lightning illuminate the pitch-black sky, revealing ominous dark clouds.

With the dim moonlight coming through my bedroom windows and the bright flashes of lightning flooding the house, I noticed something odd. A huge feeling of uncertainty washed over me, and dread filled my lungs and heart and I felt as though I was almost drowning in it.

 I couldn’t make out what it was, but as the feeling grew, I spun around, scanning my room for anything suspicious. Subconsciously, I reached for my gun but stopped myself when I neither heard nor saw anything out of place, that’s when I noticed in the moonlight I had no shadow again.

“Jesus Christ,” I suddenly heard in a distorted voice, twisted in a range of unsettling vocals. I looked down at the foot of my bed to see a matte black, grotesque version of a human. Half of its body was sticking out from under the bed, the other half hidden covered by the rest of my bed.

 I screamed louder than I’d ever screamed before, terrifying myself on top of the horror I was witnessing. It said “Jesus Christ” again, this time deeper, darker, with more gravel in its voice and louder. I collapsed onto the floor, scrambling away as the creature slithered back under the bed.

As I crawled toward the bedroom door, I realized to my horror, that I had left the gun on the nightstand.

 “God damn it,”

 I cursed myself. Reaching for the light switch, I flipped it on, but as I stood up, I noticed a sharp pain in my ankle. It had been slit open. Blood rushed out of the slit ankle and the skin with an almost razor-sharp cut. I collapsed to the floor again, and when I looked back, all I could see were two yellowish-brown eyes staring at me from under the bed.

“GoD DaMnIt,”

 The creature mimicked my words, its voice jagged and unnatural. Fear overwhelmed me as if someone had lit me on fire. I sat up and desperately tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. By now, I was crying due to whatever was under my bed mimicking my words. Trying frantically to get the door open while glancing over my shoulder to see if the creature was coming after me.

After several attempts, the door finally gave way. I practically crawled out of the room, screaming and sobbing, slamming the door behind me. But as I closed the door, I got one last look at the creature. It was still watching me from under the bed, fixated solely on me, tracking my every move like a predator stalking its prey.



As I crawled out of my room while bleeding soaking my wooden floor with my blood turning the once oak stairs to a dark red and covering myself in the same pool of it I got up to my feet and finally was able to at least hop, to my kitchen where I kept a first aid box. 

I threw it open spilling some of the contents on the floor and getting some of it soaked in the blood that turned some of the gauze from snow white to red the cut must have slit the artery above the ankle.

 I threw on a tourniquet and with all my might I tightened down the strap and then forcefully and painfully I don’t want to admit it but I shed tears, as I bore down as I turned the windlass until I couldn’t anymore with all my might almost blacking out in the process. 

The bleeding eventually slowed down and I was able to quickly patch up the wound wrap it with gauze and bandage and treat it with some disinfectant. 

It wasn’t perfect but it was what I had and it would have to do for now. It still hurt like a son of a bitch (obviously I thought to myself) I could hear whatever the hell was in my room stirring awake now and was still in my room and it was starting to move and I don’t think it was coming to give fucking hugs either.

 The boards of the house cracked and groaned so whatever was in there wasn’t light by any means. My keys to my car were in the room as well, so there wasn’t any escaping unless I wanted to limp for five miles and possibly get my wound infected and die in the cold and rain along the way.

 I grabbed a flashlight as I made my way to the downstairs of my house, as I was going to try and hide from it.

 I limped my way down the stairs and into the bottom part of my house and I made sure to not turn on the lights as I didn't give away my hiding spot. I settled on hiding in the guest bedroom, locking the door behind me and turning on my flashlight.

 I sat there listening to whatever the hell was in my room move around and groan with a freakish noise as it moved around the house. It tried to speak a few times but it just repeated the same phrase saying

 “God damnit”... “God damnit” 

In this things fucked up voice in almost a whisper and shout at the same time, it reverbed throughout the house bouncing off all the walls and windows and into the bedroom I was hiding in. 

What went from heavy sounds of footsteps as if someone was marching around to what I can only describe as wet mushy clomps hitting the floor and almost sounded like if you were taking the insides of a watermelon and a pumpkin and squishing them with your bare hands.

 I was shaking with fear paralyzed by it. I couldn’t move either. This was the most scared I had ever been and he could feel it. 

The realization of not knowing what to do sat with me as I heard this thing roar and roam around the house for hours I hid in my house quietly crying in the corner from what he concluded was a shadow hunting me.

 After it went quiet in the house I decided to muster up whatever courage I had left and I was going to try and escape from this hellish nightmare. I’ve been through worse than this and this wasn’t going to be my story's end, I wasn’t going to die to a monster from hell. 

So with all the bravery in my heart, I stood up and limped my way over to the door and cracked it open to see whatever was out there still.

 It stared right at me,

 it had turned into a ball of flesh and bones. It had no more facial features, all of its matte black color was stripped and replaced with white skin and eyes that looked like they were torn out of somebody’s face. 

There were bones where there shouldn’t, couldn’t have been bones, the ulna was lodged into its ribcage so the arm was just a tube of flesh,

 the rib cage itself was facing out the back had been flipped around and was sticking out halfway of its body.

 I flung myself back into the bedroom once more, the ball of flesh burst open the door and was screaming at me like a child having a temper tantrum. 

“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME”

 I screamed at the top of my lungs, feeling like I was going to lose my voice in the process. The ball of flesh, bone, and hair responded to me,

 “What do you want from me?”

 I almost vomited at the sound of hearing it spit back my shout into a question at me.

 I quickly swallowed the hot acidic vomit that crept up my throat, as it regurgitated my words back to me. 

The flesh that was dripping and falling off this thing's body as if you left the ice cream out for too long was ever so slightly inching towards me as I tried to hold my flashlight in hand shaking with fear. 

I noticed I had pissed myself in fear as the wetness from my boxers leaked onto the floor, 

“Jesus Christ” 

The thing gurgled and mocked me that I had pissed myself and I wasn’t going to allow it. I got up and without a care for my bloody ankle I charged at this hellish beast and I was going to kill it but that didn’t happen.

 It opened its mouth that had been carved from ear to ear, the teeth that looked like they came out of a mix of a T.rex and a hippo. Where I ran and jumped was directly aimed at the beast’s mouth.

I tried to move out of the way but it was to no use, it’s teeth clenched and I was caught in them, I screamed and thrashed around with one-half of my body in it blood spurting everywhere as I tried to break free but it was no use, the teeth yet again bore down on my shoulder, tightening even more with somehow even more force this time. My flesh split in two as the teeth tore it apart from fat to muscle fibers.

 It didn't care as it chewed its way into me. Then it let go, for whatever reason it had released me from its death grip in its mouth and yet again stared at me only this time I could see the silhouette of it because I had dropped my flashlight in the corner when it attacked me. 

The creature yet again lurched forward and hit me right on top of the head. I then awoke in a chair not bound, but in a chair. With the sun beginning to rise and the forest outside my house starting to lighten up the night sky into a bluish haze. 

I awoke in my living room with my laptop sitting in front of me. Was it all a dream? I very quietly said to myself in the chair. 

“No” 

What I thought had been a dream was a nightmarish reality with the feeling starting to kick back in my shoulder as I looked over to see it torn in two with the shoulder cap being exposed even and with every breath I took my lung pushing out a piece of flesh from inside my chest.

 I tried to look around, but I couldn’t move as I felt disabled sitting there. I noticed in the corner of the living the vile creature still with all of its grotesque features like a teratoma had exploded and had features that of a human and could speak. 

After a minute or two the creature then shifted in the corner but it didn’t move itself, it was moving from the inside and it was trying to molt. First, a hand poked the belly of the beast and then a leg and then the face of something. 

Eventually, it exploded out of the bile creature's belly and it sent chunks of flesh and intestines everywhere coating the walls in a sludge full of meat and bone fragments. The creature that came out had evolved a very human-like appearance almost like me…… 

The realization hit me like a freight train. Everything from its body, tallness, and even skin, had been replicated down to my exact measurements and looks. It slowly walked over to me and put its blood-covered hand on the side of my face, I threw up and projectile vomited all over myself as it patted me on the head and tried to speak to me in its broken English tongue learning ever so slightly 

“It’s okay just relax”

 I tried to shake what were my own hands off of me but it was to no use as my neck, spine, and skull cracked and popped violently, with every move I tried to make. I thrashed around on my office chair with me behind me but as soon as I felt my doppelgängers fingers turn from their hard chiseled hands to sharp and razor claws, I heard my phone ring. 

It was Rob he was calling to check in on me to see how I was holding up. The beast growled in disappointment, I guess it wasn’t a fan of Rob for whatever reason. The creature stared at my phone until it went silent, then it rang again. Rob never was one to just call once, especially in this case where he was giving me a checkup call. Call after call eventually became text after text and the time between them shortened.



My mutilated doppelgänger wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and seeing that Rob was now on his way, it seemed like my only way out of this nightmare. The creature turned me around in my office chair of death, “You know there’s no way out of this right?” I spat in its face letting it know that I had made up my mind even if I did make it out of here. 



 As I sat there clinging on to life, awaiting the release of death whether it would be from the blood loss, or the creature that was now growing in the corner, doing God knows what. I heard the indistinguishable noise of Rob’s brakes arriving at the front of the house.

 My body jolted alive once more, with every ounce and microgram of strength I had left within my dying body, I tried to yell for help but all that came out was a shy cry of a whisper for help.

 I could hear Rob call for me from his car, expecting me to walk out of the front door I did. But it wasn’t me, my doppelganger was walking out of the front door to go and do god knows what to Rob.

 But nothing did happen, as I heard the two of them talking outside the mimic perfectly copying my voice. 

But I heard something that gave me a chance for survival. Rob had asked what happened to my arm and that he didn’t see any stitches. My mimic asked him to come inside and he’ll show him what happened. 

“NO DON’T COME INSIDE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON’T DO IT”

 But my screams of silence were to no use as there was no hope I saw myself appear in the doorway without a shadow no less and then harshly swing open the front door walking in smiling at me from ear to ear, like a kid on Christmas day. 

Rob followed closely behind my mimic and what turned into a smile of him expecting to sit down and enjoy some nice hot coffee after a long night on the job, turned into a revolting disgust, as he froze in the doorway and dropped to his knees.

 Rob saw me sitting there half slumped in my chair wheezing for air, caked in blood mixed in with the green vile vomit and waste and with bits of entrails and skin all over me, covering me from head to toe. 

Rob sat there on his knees, in silence taking in the sight of me as I lay there. He slowly got up and shifted over to me closely examining me. I guess he couldn’t tell if it was me or not with all the grotesque fluids and solids on me. 

“Marcus? Is that you?” 

Rob asked in a shivering sheepish voice almost shedding tears. All I could do was slightly nod confirming his suspicion, the only thing he could see was the whites of my eyes behind the thick curtain of blood covering the rest of my facial features. 

Rob reached out to me but a firm hand was then placed on his shoulder. It was my mimic’s hand or more or less my hand, the hand in whole, tightly gripped Rob’s shoulder pressing against his blue cotton shirt that he was wearing for his shift that night.

The single hand then became two and then flung Rob across the living room floor, and he came down with a violent crash putting a massive hole into the wall where his torso hit. Rob groaned with pain as he got up, but my mimic was too fast for him he teleported to him from where I was sitting. 

Before Rob could even get a chance to try and defend himself the mimic grabbed him from the front of his collar like if you grabbed a puppy from his scruff and opened his freakishly large mouth. Saliva and mucus dripped and poured over the sides of the mouth of the creature.

Its teeth were pointy like a doctor’s needle, his tongue was too long for his mouth so it played out the side of his face. The roof of his mouth and not yet fully developed so all that was there in replacement were fibers and muscles that didn’t fully cover it and left gaps that looked almost like the inside of fish gills.

The mimic was about to clamp down on Rob and leave a bloody mess of his head.

“WAIT!”

I had mustered up enough of my breath to say that. The mimic then froze as he was holding Rob in the air. He dropped Rob from his future demise and closed his demonic mouth.

“What? What could you possibly want now in your final moments?”

“How does the taste of lead feel motherfucker”

Rob then pointed to his 45. That he had grabbed from his waistband and unloaded a full magazine into the body of the creature. 

The bullets Rob had fired went straight through the creature’s torso, and a couple through his head. It screamed with an ear-deafening screech which left my ears ringing and almost deaf. The creature slumped and bent halfway over and collapsed to the ground.

Rob ran over to me, in a hurry panic with a state of shock on his face. He grabbed me without question and slung me over his back. As he was carrying me out of the doorway I heard the creature move.

Rob hurriedly put me in the passenger seat of his car and started it. I looked only with my eyes as my neck was still in serious pain to see the mimic standing in the doorway. Rob also noticed and loaded another mag into his sidearm and let loose another 7 bullets.

Most of them hit, the ones that did hit the monster, and parts of flesh ejected from it. A part of the left torso had completely blown off, not due to the bullets but because of the mimic. It knelt and started ejecting even more of its skin.

 It looked like it was ejecting plates or skin armor, what was underneath was an amalgamation of red muscle like if you skinned a human alive and took away the base layer. Smooth dark red muscle moving in unison around the body. Rob hopped back into the car not even wanting to look at what was growing on my doorstep. 

What happened after that I can’t remember as I was either blacked out due to the blood loss I sustained or just unconscious and on the brink of death. But luckily for me according to Rob, he ignored every traffic light and sign to get me to the hospital. 

So as I am writing this and having to recount all the horrific details of what demonic activity sprung in my house to write this, all the advice I have to give you is.

If you’re shadow stops following you

Please don’t ignore it.

It was amazing, but at the same time, I don’t like him like that","I admit that I want to meet someone organically, so I initially agreed to this date to practice my flirting skills a bit more. So I went on this date, and the guy was super cool. He bought me a coffee, and I thought the date would last for maybe an hour or so. We ended up talking for three hours about a variety of subjects such as racism, mental health, toxic masculinity. We have interests in Star Wars and Ender’s Game, and we were talking about that. 

So I went on a date with a guy who I have chemistry with, who I can have deep conversations with, and who appears to be physically attracted to me. We’re going to go out on another date, but I can’t imagine myself ever being with him. I feel really awful for writing this. He’s of another ethnicity, and a few years ago, I was sexually assaulted by a person of that same group. As the years have gone by, I’ve been able to make friends with people of this ethnic group, but it’s a different thing entirely potentially being intimate with them. I know it’s awful.

Ive been diagnosed with bipolar 2 since 2018 but suffered from depression and anxiety all my life. I've tried everything. I have friends, a social life. I go out when I can. I've been long distance running regularly now for two years, I've even completed races. I exercise regularly. I try to eat relatively healthy and regularly. I take my medication. I try to keep my apartment clean (can still be a struggle). I'm taking courses to upgrade my schooling so I can hopefully go back to school to get some kind of career. I have a romantic relationship that's healthy and pleasant. I've lost weight and I'm no longer fat, just totally average and healthy. I live alone with my own apartment that I pay for, no roommates or family. I own my own car. I try not to consume alcohol on a regular basis (sometimes drink once in a week or so if there's stuff to attend). I limit my caffeine to before noon (quit for over a year but I'm back having morning coffee).

I don't understand. I feel like Im doing everything right. But I'm still depressed and so so anxious. I spend countless hours thinking about how no one likes me and feeling shame and guilt for everything. I can be in an okay mood and then boom all of a sudden plummet into deep despair. I still struggle with suicidal ideation when I really plummet and lose my mind, which is a lot - rarely do I have a whole good week. I still have days where I eat too much and then feel like Im trapped in a huge fat body (almost every day). I still feel like I can't trust my brain and I feel that I need to hide away to save my own life. Sometimes I still struggle with self harm.

Is there a solution? Any hope? Will upping my SSRI help? Sometimes I wake up and for a time I struggle to leave the house, even to run. I guess I should ask my doctor, but I wonder what should I say?

Ive been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 but I'm afraid to take mood stabilizers because I'm terrified to gain weight, which will plunge me into deep depression that I know I won't be able to escape. When I took abilify I didnt feel much different but that was about 6 years ago now. Sometimes I wonder if I should ask about benzodiazepines or some kind of amphetamine.

Please, any insight or even just your thoughts would help, I have no one in my life who really knows the depth of my mental health struggles anymore and Im trying so hard to keep up face, but Im totally lost. I just want to feel happy and feel like all of this is worth it. Will I eventually feel ok if I keep it up? It is just so so so hard for me to keep this up, so hard to achieve anything even when I really really push. Life feels like torture.

I need help keeping my house smelling generally not bad, good even. I rent a small house and it’s my first time being in charge of my own home. I am a clean person and find cleaning to be relaxing and get stressed out by it feeling dirty. Despite that, the house just never smells *good*. It usually smells embarrassingly stinky. 

We have 3 cats and a small dog (9lbs and potty trained) which of course contributes to the smell. We have hardwood and one tiny carpet under our coffee table. Our couch is new so it doesn’t harbor any stink. Of course the litterboxes are cleaned every day. I try to open windows and air the house out as much as possible, but we live in Texas so that’s been difficult to do the last few months. 

How do you all do it? Any tips that greatly improved your homes general aroma? Is there a cleaning regiment or product you suggest? I will take any and all advice.

It's been tough to find folks who are both childfree and that I can find an understanding with. I'm quite critical of modern society and don't mesh super well with most people and believe we may very well be walking into the apocalypse, so I'd like to enjoy what remains the best I can, which is probably why I'm trying to watch every movie out there.

Seeking others who don't fit in, likely other neurodivergents or something of that nature I'm not really big on labels. I find life a daily struggle, I want someone who gets that, and would like to tackle it as a team. I like to spend quality time: walks, deep talks, gaming, watching TV shows, maybe a little project.

Long distance can work but would like to meet on some reasonable timeline. I have EU citizenship. I should note I'll never move to the US.

I dislike two things: beards and Funko Pops, I'm sorry.

About me:

- 165 cm, 55kg, from Eastern Europe, brown hair with a fair bit of gray, green eyes
- I have no sense of style and just wear comfortable sporty clothes that fit well
- NOT a cat person, I only enjoy the furry beasts at a distance, can't live with them
- Software Developer in consulting
- probably somewhere on the spectrum
- have some recurring mental health issues, tried therapy and meds, didn't take, traded them for music lessons and running/biking
- casual gaming, mostly ARPGs and single player games, right now playing Factorio again
- really into movies and TV shows and discussing themes and characters
- don't read as much as I'd like
- like sci-fi and horror, especially together

Introverted homebody with a much bigger world in my head than is probably reasonable. Sometimes I write about it, but that goes to my grave. I mostly go outside to catch a movie. Not huge on the organization aspect of traveling so I typically don't, but I like walks around a city or in a forest searching for snails or mushrooms and have a thing for trains and airplanes.

I like the quiet, the calm and the dark, with a hint of the macabre. A night owl no matter how much I've tried to convince myself otherwise. I have to take most things slow and struggle to establish new routines, sometimes having difficulties with things others find easy. I don't cook, for instance.

I find it easy to enjoy simple things like a rainy afternoon or a cozy ride on a tram or just a fine cup of coffee, so I don't really need a lot of excitement in my life. I seek, and would like to provide, mutual security and understanding and emotional and intellectual depth, through conversation and enjoyment of art.",3,1729799560.0,cf4cf,0,0.8,False

**Virgin Hotels New Orleans (Central Business District)** — Big fan. Friendly staff, great gym, and the coffee shop mentioned below (Funny Library) was awesome for work. Also dog friendly. Centrally located with a restaurant and pool bar/restaurant on the roof.



**Lower Garden District (Near Coliseum Square Park)** — Miraculously worked out via a friend of a friend for lodging. It's an awesome area to spend the majority of the time; quiet, walkable, beautiful. A good peaceful yin to the more chaotic yang of the main city if that’s your thing.



— — — — — — — — — — — — — —



# 🏋🏼 WHERE I WORKED OUT OR RAN 🏃🏻

# 

**Franco’s on Magazine** — It ain’t too much but it will definitely do the trick. Usually very empty, all the machines work, and one month only with no annoying cancelation terms or commitments was only $100, including as many classes as you want to do. It was perfect for my wife and I.



**St. Charles Avenue (Lower Garden District Stretch)** — As recommended by Reddit. Flat, grass was good for the knees, and if you run in the direction so you can see the tram long before it’s in your face, you won’t end up as roadkill. Great for an out and back. 



**Audubon Park** — Simply gorgeous. Dirt or asphalt of your choosing, bountiful shade from magnificent trees all over. Gawking at the cool houses along the park is also a fun distraction. Magnificent. 



**WATCH OUT FOR UNEVEN SIDEWALKS!** — I had not taken a fall while running in many years but it happened at one point on St. Charles. There are some really gnarly sidewalks around, some that pop out of nowhere literally. Careful.



— — — — — — — — — — — — — —



# ☕️ WHERE I GOT COFFEE AND WORKED 💼



**Funny Library Coffee Shop New Orleans** — Spent a bunch of work days here during the stay at Virgin Hotel and damn, I loved this place. Great environment with the art and furnishings, comfortable seats, and really strong WiFi with great food (loved the avocado toast with fried egg) and even better La Colombe coffee. But the biggest shoutout the staff here—INCREDIBLY kind and friendly. I don’t know if the free iced coffee refills were only for hotel guests but I took advantage of that many times over. 



**Mojo Coffee House (1500 Magazine St location)** — Good vibe and big inside with plenty of seating; but I thought the coffee was not very good and the WiFi wasn’t very strong. I appreciate the Halloween pet portrait they did for my dog though! 



**French Truck Coffee (1200 Magazine St location)** — Good coffee, good WiFi, nice little outdoor area. Fine place to work. 



**PJ’s Coffee (2140 Magazine St location)** — For a chain place: solid coffee and WiFi, chairs not that comfortable but looking out onto Magazine while working is nice. 



**Hivolt** — Great coffee and vibe with lots of art. Such friendly staff. Tasty Fruity Pebbles Rice Kripsie Treats. WiFi is pretty weak though and I couldn’t stay long because o fit.



— — — — — — — — — — — — — —



# 🎶 MUSIC I SAW / PLACES I SHOPPED / THINGS I DID 🛒

  


**Gretna Fest** — Went on Sunday. Local staples blended with an eclectic mix of Boomer rock (Blue Oyster Cult, Steve Miler Band), jam, funk, and what have you. The setup of the festival within the town was very charming and the food villages were fun. The lack of shade made a hot day feel extra long though.



**The St. Charles Trolley** — The longest continuously running trolley line in the world apparently? Count me in. $1.25 is a deal and while the speed won’t blow you away, if you’re here to enjoy your vacation you’re gonna love taking in all the houses on St. Charles as you slowly drift by. Awesome experience. 



**National WWII Museum** — A well-established and deserved must of the city. Incredible mix of strategy and battles, personal stories of soldiers' heroism, crazy artifacts like Hitler’s tea kettle and bottles from Hiroshima, and more. Four hours and I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what’s in here.



**d.b.a.** — Caught Colin Davis & Night People here. Tiny little stage with great sound and a u-shaped bar spanning two rooms. Great vibes, great music, fair prices, great location. Liked this quite a lot.



**Superdome**— Hit the Bucs vs. Saints game on 10/13. The stadium shows its age a bit but it definitely has plenty of charm to it. Feels massive. Loved the party vibe just outside the stadium with the vendors and stage setup. The on-field product obviously leaves something to be desired right now, but I’m a Giants fan so I can’t really talk.



**Tipitina’s** — We saw Lotus play here on 10/13. Lotus absolutely brought it and I loved, loved, loved this venue. Cozy in the best possible way with great sound and incredibly affordable drinks. A major duh if you’re in town while an artist you like is playing. 



**NOLA Funk Fest at New Orleans Jazz Museum** — The area was absolutely bumping for this. Loved the intimate feel of this festival. Seeing George Porter Jr. finish up with Ain’t No Use → Sneakin’ Sally to close out my month in NOLA was a dream; the set was so damn good.. My wife had the time of her life at Big Freedia right after too.



**Fritzel’s European Jazz Club** — Saw the Fritzel’s All-Stars play. Amazing jazz music in a brick cave environment that feels, go figure, European. I loved the intimate crowd setup here and the feeling of stepping into another world just off Bourbon Street. Absolutely worth checking out.



**The Spotted Cat Music Club** — Fritzel’s, but make it standing room and a little bit more divey; equally awesome. The bartenders were incredibly friendly and the music and place truly feels like a communal experience. 



**Audubon Park —** The best kind of urban park: not massive, not small. Gorgeous trees all over providing shade, run paths, gorgeous houses on the edges and how amazing is…



**The Tree of Life** — So beautiful. I had to hug it. 



**Prytania Theatres at Canal Place** — It’s a theater. In a mall. Not the most updated screens or sound systems and the chairs don’t recline but they are comfortable either way and the bathrooms are very close to the screens. Full bar. I saw The Substance here ($13) and was the only person in the theater who made it to the end. One of 2024’s best.



**Frenchmen Art Bazaar** — Must go! Incredible variety of art in the heart of Frenchmen Street. For reference I bought, all from different vendors: Evil Dead Necronomicon sticker, hand-painted cheetah playing a trumpet with a hand-painted frame, artist drawn shirt with handmade bleached tie dye, and some original photography. Awesome. 



**Oktoberfest at Deutsches Haus** — Great time and vibes! Plentiful tents, solid German food, and The Brats covering songs like “Chop Suey!” in a German polka style was hysterical. Everyone was having an absolute blast everywhere you looked. Recommended. 



**Sydney and Walda Besthoff Sculpture Garden** — Free museums always hit and this one is no different. A serene place to admire some very cool artwork within City Park.



**New Orleans City Park** — Always love a good, huge park within a city and this one checks all the boxes. Nice place to take a long walk and take in some nature.



**Zèle NOLA** — A fun and large collection of art from local creators, everything from jewelry and notebooks to painting and photography. Good place to grab a gift.



**Miette** — Similar to above, but a more indie quirky and weird with it. Also smaller in size.



**Dirty Coast (1320 Magazine Street)** — Some fun merch and designs; loving my new Famous Islands of the World: New Orleans hat. 



**Magazine Antique Mall** — Popped in and out of a lot of antique shops on Magazine but neglected to make note of them. This one seemed the biggest, almost like a labyrinth, but the prices seemed a little inconsistent. 



**Bluesberry Festival (Covington, LA)** — Cute little thing. Two or three stages and lots of people in lawn chairs. Nice pit stop if in the area, but you don’t need to go out of your way unless you’re really into the artists playing.



**Oak Alley Plantation** — We attempted to hit a Tiger Stadium tailgate but neglected we’d have to walk a mile-plus from parking to where someone we knew was. The wife has a bad foot so we decided to audible here. It’s…fine I guess. $30 seems steep for what you get, and it really feels like they sweep the whole slavery thing under the rug entirely. The line of oak trees leading to the mansion is most definitely a sight though. 



— — — — — — —



# 🍽️ WHERE I ATE 🤤



**Acme Oyster House** — We got here before a massive line started, so we dodged that. Fun, homey interior and can understand its status, but thought the food was a mixed bag. Fried oysters were addictive, but the Po Boy was just okay.



**Turkey and the Wolf** — New York sandwich snob here; this place is worth the hype and more. That fried bologna sandwich is the stuff of dreams: the huge, fluffy bread, the delectable house made mustard, the bologna! Don’t think just go, go, go.



**Stein’s Market and & Deli** — I read that the Turkey and the Wolf folks said that this is actually the best sandwich in the city, but they feel more like complimentary pieces, with this being your classic Jewish deli. And it absolutely rules. Got a pastrami reuben where each bite was better than the last. Go to both if you can.



**Cochon Butcher** — Keeping the sandwich section going, another banger here with the porchetta sandwich. The meat was melting in my mouth and the pita-esque housing was an interesting twist. Entire menu looked awesome, but only got to go here once. 



**Cochon Restaurant**— More of the goodness from the deli portion, but make it a sit down meal. Everything we had here was great but that fried alligator was absolute flavor explosion.



**GW Fins** — If you’re going for a fancy meal—gotta rock a collar!—this could be the move for you. Amazing, decorative interiosr with friendly, smiling, knowledgeable service. I didn’t love my order (Scalibut) but everything else was top notch (lobster bisque, crusted drum, tempura snapper breast, and others). Dessert was also outrageous and very rich. All in all, a very fancy and upscale experience without feeling pretentious. 



**August** — We went here for an anniversary dinner and it was great for a date night; loved the old school brick walls, chandeliers, and mood lighting. Service was exceptional. I had the red snapper which I liked plenty but the real stunner was the gnocchi with crab and truffle. God damn.



**Compère Lapin** — Another place that feels like a good date night spot, but perhaps more approachable than Fins or August. Curried goat was a wonderful blend of flavors and felt like a truly unique dish when looking back on all these meals. 



**Port of Call** — Oh hell yeah. Dark dive bar with low lighting and wood everywhere slinging amazing burgers and loaded baked potatoes. Lemonade out of a massive, branded plastic cup. Loved eating here and then walking down to the main drags to burn off the burger.



**District Donuts Sliders Brew (2209 Magazine Street)** — Seems like a small chain, but my BBQ burger was definitely made with plenty of care…very tasty. I didn’t bother with the donuts; my Type 1 Diabetic can only push my luck so much in a place like NOLA.



**Original Slap Burger** — Speaking of burgers: this one hit. Served out of a window in the back of Marie’s Bar and Kitchen, it’s a really solid smash style burger with a healthy dose of pepper for seasoning. Loved bringing it into the bar to eat with a cold PBR bottle. 



**Shaya** — Oh man, this was top tier. The fried chicken hummus was one of the most memorable first bites I’ve had in a minute and one of the best dishes I had in NOLA. Add in an incredible vodka martini, amazing pita and dips, and that fall off the bone lamb with the whipped feta base and this was elite from start to finish.



**Saba** — And this was also top tier; we ended up going twice. I know there is some overlap with owner/former owner situation and some controversy here with Shaya, so the strong similarities obviously make sense. The blue crab hummus is an absolute must here and both the harissa chicken and especially the lamb kofta were stellar. And of course the pitas and dips were phenomenal too. Just go.



**Heart Dat Kitchen** — This one felt truly NOLA. Tiny little thing slinging up hearty, homemade specialities. The fried chicken over the mac and cheese was absolute bliss and the price felt right. I would say that driving here at night felt a little hairy at points to be honest, so just a heads up on that. 



**Surrey's Café & Juice Bar** — Went twice. Perhaps there are “fancier” brunch-y options on paper, but for my money this is the one with perhaps the most flavor and charm. Everything we had was so damn tasty: the biscuits with sausage gravy, the crab meat omlette, and my lord the French toast type thing stuffed with bananas and rum sauce was next level decadent. Loved all the art on the walls. Worth the wait, easily. 



**Sneaky Pickle & Bar Brine** — Super cute and quirky little place. If you’re looking for a slightly healthier or vegetarian option, this is gonna be a great choice. Also one of the places where the menu felt like it had some truly different items than everywhere else. 



**Luke** — Feels somewhere between casual and high end. The steak frites were solid with a healthy portion and the gumbo had a nice kick to it. Maybe not one to go out of the way for, but definitely not bad at all.



**Molly’s Rise and Shine** — After eating at Turkey and the Wolf my expectations were high for this one and the meal delivered. Once I got into the dressed biscuit of the fried chicken biscuit as the massive chicken spilled out the sides, I was in nirvana. One of the best dishes of my trip and worth the hype and the wait to get served.



**Miss Shirley’s** — Family style chinese, and damn good at that. These dumplings were top notch and the orange chicken and beef were massive in size. A few beers from a nano brewery all the way in Nanjing was a cool wrinkle.  Also, Miss Shirley herself coming out and making sure everyone is enjoying their food is too cute.



**Parkway Bakery and Tavern** — Full disclosure: New York sandwich snob checking in again and I just don’t know if Po Boys are my thing. I wish I knew to call ahead for pick up here for starters; the waiting in line then waiting for the food aspect of this took a solid hour or more. Respect to the workers here, they have this thing truly running like a well oiled machine. As for the Po Boy itself (gulf shrimp) it was really quite good, and the proportion of bread to fish/meat finally felt right. I just don’t know if I’d do this wait again.



**Kenney Seafood** — Best Po Boy I had. Not in NOLA technically (Slidell) but this thing hit so hard. And an absolutely absurd amount of food (the sandwich and two sides) for the low price. If you’re in the area, you have to go. 



**Pomelo** — We were able to sit down here when nothing else on Magazine had availability before our Tipitina’s show. The ratings are really good but the Thai food was just…okay? Not bad, just not anything to go crazy over. 



**Atchafalaya** — Another one that was well worth the hype. The vibe, the service, the absinthe bloody mary, the crabcake eggs benedict, everything was awesome. It seems like they do a jazz brunch which I am sad to have missed, but this is definitely one I will be going back to. Stellar all around.



**Peche Seafood Grill** — I quickly understood why this massive space was bustling like it was; we didn’t have a bad dish. It’s interesting in that it felt like they took all the NOLA seafood staples but didn’t give them the full throttle NOLA flourishes and wrinkles, but it still felt unique and noteworthy.

# 🍺 WHERE I DRANK 🍸



**Bacchanal Fine Wine & Spirits** — An absolute vibe. Walk into a wine store…and then a chill backyard with live music…and then a treehouse bar. All at once. Unique setup all around and the staff were beyond pleasant. Jams were great too. 



**Snake and Jake's Christmas Club Lounge** — Possibly my favorite bar I went to. Outside it’s a dilapidated looking home. Inside it’s dark and cramped, lit only by red Christmas lights. Outside you’re in a massive backyard surrounded by huge and beautiful trees. I loved every part of this place and would recommend it as an absolute must if you’re a fan of charming little dives.



**The Abbey** — Lovely little dive. Cheap beers, a local vibe. In the thick of it but seemingly overlooked. CD jukebox falling apart and you gotta really earn your plays on it with some finesse. $3 High Lifes were hitting. 



**Chart Room** — Similar to The Abbey; very centrally located to Bourbon but feels like its own thing. Tiny and hallway-shaped with a few tables and a bar. Friendly bartenders and good energy.



**Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar** — This is my stuff. Divey, historic, dark and candlelit, moody but welcoming. My classic rock picks were hitting on the jukebox. It’s an awesome place to just sit and people watch inside or out the door. Highly recommended. 



**Erin Rose** — Take a small detour off the heart of Bourbon and you’ll find another absolute winner for me, and one of the only bars I went to twice. Tiny little thing with cheap beers ($3 High Lifes), frozen Irish coffees and an environment where everyone is yapping with each other. Loved all the kitschy decorations, and the Killer PoBoys they are slinging in the back. 



**Urban South Brewery** — Hmmm, hard to say for the venue. I walked into this MASSIVE space and I was the only person there. I tried a flight and then bought a custom four-pack. A few solid brews, a few misses, but I imagine this place could be a lot of fun with a crew. Your standard brewery location in an industrial feeling part of town.



**Nola Brewing & Pizza Co.** — We came here to see Talking Grass (Talking Heads bluegrass cover band) play and have a nightcap. I didn’t really love either of my beers, but it was super joyful in there and the legitimate stage setup was great within a large space featuring multiple rooms. I did not try the pizza.



**Care Forgot Beercraft** — It was the most humble of the three breweries in terms of site size or distribution, but it was the best beers I had. Tiny little taproom with a handful of tables but really enjoyed my drinks here.



**The Avenue Pub** — A really solid little beer bar with a good chicken sandwich too. Homey and lived-in feel from all the wood. Nice place to watch a game or two, or just hang on the balcony overlooking St. Charles Avenue.



**Old Absinthe House** — The historical factor is cool, but kinda generally meh on this. It felt like a tourist trap and the \~$25 absinthe cocktail out of a plastic cup seemed to confirm it. 



**Pat O’Brien’s** — A pinch touristy? Sure. Worth doing? Absolutely. Loved the choose-your-own-adventure feel, from watching playoff baseball in one room to dueling pianos in another to just hanging outside in the beautiful garden with the flaming fountain. I can’t give you my Hurricane review; didn’t try one with the whole Type 1 Diabetes thing.



**Parasol’s** — Your classic, friendly, neighborhood Irish dive. Cheap drinks, joyful bartenders, sports on TV and a local feel. I was told the roast beef Po Boy was a banger but did not get to try it. 



**The Rusty Nail** — It was bumping for NFL Sunday and the Saints game. The outdoor area with the palm trees and plentiful seating was a nice touch, it almost didn’t feel like you were in the city. 



**The Bulldog, Uptown** — Pretty standard stuff in terms of pub grub and setup, but a solid craft selection and the little outdoor area with the huge TV is a fun little setup. 



**Rendezvous Tavern** — In the unscientific metrics of dive bars…the ceiling is probably too high. But it’s got plenty of cold beer, casino games, and a pool table. Nice place to pop into to get outta the heat since the AC was BLASTING in here.



**Check Point Charlie** — Dark, dingy, music too loud, and 24 hours. Oh there’s also laundry. Centrally located on Frenchmen. That’s very much my scene but if dives aren’t your favorite you can probably skip.



**The Polo Club** — Swanky. Located in the five star hotel The Windsor Court, wife and I had drinks here before our anniversary dinner. Big comfortable leather chairs and couches, jazz pianist, and lots of polo photos. Decidedly not NOLA in many ways, but a killer vodka martini and good for a fancy stop if you want that. 



**Hi-Ho Lounge** — Went here for Burning Shore, a Phish and Dead cover band. Crowd was very small but friendly. Bartenders were slow and not paying attention even with an empty bar. Could be cool with the right elements, but for now…just eh.



**Commons Club New Orleans** — In the Virgin Hotel. Carries the artsy bohemian vibe of the coffee shop and hotel into a bar setting. Good drinks, fun little bar. Wouldn’t go out of my way if I wasn’t at the hotel already.



**The Pool Club New Orleans** — Top of the Virgin Hotel. Pool is teeny tiny, but the rooftop perspective is fun and it’s a nice place to have a drink and watch football. Food was extremely forgettable. 



**Marie’s Bar and Kitchen** — Ended up here to get Original Slap Burger and loved it. Cigarette vending mashing, ornery bartenders, cold beers, and cash only. Nice little corner area outside to watch the world go by.

My coffee is under extracted (too sour and sometimes even salty), I use a De Longhi La Specialista and I’ve already tried going finer, increasing the ratio and using hotter water.

Long story long:
I’ve been into this niche for at least a couple of years, watching yt and reading reddit posts. About 4 months ago I bought my first coffee machine and I’ve never opened the same bag of beans twice, trying various kind of coffee. I’m prepared on the theory and honestly I don’t think I’m incapable of preparing a decent espresso, although I still haven’t brewed an espresso that I actually enjoyed drinking (I still enjoyed most of them but only because I enjoyed brewing coffee).
Fortunately I haven’t guests very often but I feel bad every time someone asks me for a coffee because I already know they will not enjoy it very much (typical comment: “I can taste that the coffee is of good quality but it tastes strange”); I’m Italian, so you should know that we are used to good espresso, and for no reason coffee should taste sour.

My typical coffee is prepared like this:
16-18g; WDT; tamp; 10s pre infusion; 22-35s (including pre infusion) and 35-38g out.
I can’t go finer (i’m between setting 1 and 2).
Currently, I’m using 100% robusta coffee from a Florence roaster, and it may be the closest thing to something “sweet” but it’s still too sour. I’m thinking of buying coffee from big roasters like lavazza, segafredo, kimbo… hoping it somehow magically tastes “good” anyway I brew it😅

I really have no Ideas, what should I do?
Feel free to ask more details or videos on how I prepare my coffee (btw I’m slowly becoming decent at latte art considering I don’t practice often)

1gbbh6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1gbbh6t/trip_report_4_days_in_edinburgh/,Trip report : 4 days in Edinburgh,"I just returned from my four day trip to Edinburgh. Gorgeous fall colors, intermittent rains, crazy winds on the last day and I loved every minute of it.

Transportation: Tram( airport & other places ), Lothian buses but mostly on foot. Extremely walkable city.

Shoes: I contemplated two pairs of shoes but also wanted to pack the bare minimum, so my Asics gel did a fantastic job and dried up pretty fast even after rain. No discomfort / pain even averaging 30k steps each day.

Clothes : I packed layers, but sweaters and a waterproof jacket was enough. It was pleasant throughout - 55 to 60F.

Weather : it was mostly sunny, and the random rains followed by sun would always pop up the fall colors. Very picturesque.

Stayed in Dean village which was a short walk to city center.

Food and drinks: No specific recommendations. Vegetarian and a teetotaler. I loved Wee Bonnie cafe, Dishoom, Pulse plant, Kochchi and all the coffee.

Itinerary:

Day 1: airport to early check in. Explored Dean village, Princes st gardens, Scott monument, sunset at Calton Hill, James Quarter mall for dinner. Highlight of the day: *two rainbows & sunset at Calton*

Day 2: Edinburgh castle(skipped the tour), Royal mile - St Giles Cathedral, judiciary building, high court, supreme court, Writers museum, Cockburn Street, Greyfriars Bobby, University of Edinburgh and Scottish museum. Tip: visit the terrace at the museum for spectacular city views. Vennel steps for uninterrupted view of Castle, Victoria street. Favorite : *St Giles, Scottish museum*.

Day 3: Dean village, Leith walkway, Belford bridge, St Bernard's well, Stockbridge, Circus lane, Saint stephens, Botanical gardens, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Queen's drive for views of Arthur's seat and finally took a tour of Scottish Parliament building. Balmoral hotel. Favorites: *Circus lane, Queen's drive, Leith walkway*.

Day 4: this was the day of cyclone(!) so canceled the day trip to Glasgow. Had no solid plans. Went to the National galleries and this was a pleasant surprise. Great art collection. Could easily spend half a day here. Gardens were closed, so went around the city again as the rains stopped. Took a random tram to see Queen's yacht and then back to royal mile and checked out a lot of random streets and alleys. Winds were absolutely crazy by evening so decided to call it a day and bid farewell to this colorful joyous city. Its the bittersweet moment of every trip.

I got a lot of useful information on this sub, so paying it forward. Happy travels.

I have to share the story of how my fiancé and I got to this point. We have come full circle and it was truly a blessing from God that we are where we are today. We met each other 9 years ago and dated for about a year and a half. We were pretty serious and talked about a future together. Had so much in common, both of us had past marriages that didn't work out very well. Met each other's families all the serious stuff. There was one big issue that caused the relationship to disintegrate though. I was the problem!!It was my own issues with alcohol and drugs. I was self centered and selfish and didn't want to stop the party life that I was a part of. She saw the huge red flags and tried to discuss the issues with me and I wasn't having any part of letting someone telling me that I had a problem. So she left...and I didn't chase her. My life spiraled out of control and eventually I hit rock bottom. Committed my self to a treatment center and made the decision to go to any length to make a different life for myself. Recovery program, sober living group home and finally returned to being able to live on my own in my own place, professional job and returned to school...was even awarded two scholarships. After three years of getting totally clean for the first time in my life. I thought that a relationship was the last thing I would find. Being able to be a part of normal society was great but I always thought about what I fool I was for pushing her away so many years ago.

She had moved twice, changed jobs twice and had also had two different cell phone numbers over the years. When I moved into my own place I knew that it was only a half a mile from her old residence. I drove by her old place every day on my way home from work and would always look at the duplex where she lived and say to myself....I wonder how her life is now, and what I could have done differently back then. I didn't search her out on FB or anything creepy, just sort of assumed that she had met someone and was happy. Then the miracle happened. I stopped for a soda on a beautiful Saturday at the convenience store a block from my place, and to my amazement as I was walking out of the store, she was walking in. I walked past her and she didn't see me. I turned around after a few steps and called her name before she made it into the store. She turned around and had to take a second to recognize me. She smiled politely and asked how I was. She took a deep breath and said she thought that that she would never guessed that she would get to see me again. She had thought for all these years that I was dead.

I asked her if we could talk sometime over coffee as I had some amends to make to her. Not knowing whether she was married...had a boyfriend or was in a relationship, I just had to come clean and make an honest apology for what had happened years before. I gave her my number and she said she would text me sometime and we could get together and talk. Later that day I received a text from her and she wanted to see if I was free that evening. I was happy to have the chance to make things right, not necessarily to start a relationship or anything like that. Was just glad that she was willing to listen to what I had to say. I was amazed to find out we had been living ONE BLOCK away from each other for over a year. We met that night, had a little fun at karaoke and stayed out till 4am just talking as friends.

I gave her all the horrible details of what I had been through. Overdosing, suicide attempts, law enforcement involvement all of the dark times I had put myself through and where I was now. We left the 24hr restaurant with a hug and a good bye. I mentioned that I was going on a weekend trip three weeks from that night and jokingly asked if she was busy that weekend. She smiled and said that she would go but I thought she was just being polite. I realized that night that I might be ready for the possibility of having another chance. She texted me the next morning while I was sitting in a church pew...and asked if I was serious about including her on my trip to the mountains in a few weeks, I said I was..as friends I told her. She said she would love to get out of the city for a couple days and wanted to join me.

Over the next few weeks we texted and talked every day. The trip was great the time in the mountains was amazing. I knew that this was my only chance and that there was a mutual love still between us. I bought a small but beautiful ring while we were on the trip, and asked her to marry me . She cried, I cried and she said yes!

In 23 days we will be married in the church we both attend now with 100 guests and family approval on both sides. The venue was given with no fee from the church, the reception venue was also given as a gift....and my employer has paid for a week long honeymoon in the same place in the mountains. So this fairytale is all mind blowing and 100% true. I hope that this real life story of second chances touches anyone that takes the time to read the whole thing.

Never give up on life or love.

People can change for the better.

God loves you no matter what happens.

Take the big chances in life!!!! ....sometimes they really do pay off.

I have never been happier and she is too....sometimes you don't get a second chance to make it count.

Sometimes you do...I wish everyone could experience this kind of miracle.

So basically, ever since I started college I've been in the same class as red haired, gorgeous looking girl. I originally paid no mind to her because I knew she wouldn’t be that interested in me and she was kind of shy and I did not want to disturb her. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks later, my classmates and I play one of those ""How much do they love you"" or ""How compatible are you guys"" games on a computer and they put me and her in the textboxes for names. Later the guys showed it to her and she laughed it off, they then all collectively pushed me towards her saying I should make the first move already. However, due to my inexperience and shyness, I didn’t.

Fast forward a bit later, I and a few others began forming the first friendgroup at my new college and we would occasionally walk over to the store to buy coffee, snacks or energy drinks. A couple of times she came with us and we started talking, at first it was a bit awkward since our personalities didn’t match. But after talking to her for a while and knowing her a little I began to notice her sweet personality and fell for her. The crush at first was not that strong, the type of crush you'd occasionally think about it and say ""Damn, she's pretty"" before going on about your day.

This is around the time when she started being part of our friendgroup, and she'd occasionally take photos of me which I didn’t mind. She'd also heart my messages on various messaging platforms at times, which made me believe that she felt the same way about me maybe. This continued for a while, until I invited her to grill with me and my homies and we were talking, we gave each other occasional glances and laughed. Soon enough I asked one of my homies to drop me their tiktok so I can stalk their reposts and she asked me if I stalked hers in a positive manner? Me panicking I said I could do it right now. Before going off she dabbed me up and our hands were holding each other for quite a while.

Fast forward to recently (I promise this is the last one), we have been talking more than normally at school. Occasionally sharing notes by messaging each other, but that’s about it. I am still not sure if she likes me, but some say she does like me. Especially because our class is mainly filled by boys and she does chill with another guy at times. I do catch her glancing at me at times, and she does write with emojis a lot, but her texts are dry. So I am confused, I don’t know how to proceed, I am fairly certain she is interested in me so I am willing to risk it. To do so I need to be able to text her more, but I genuinely do not know what to text about other than asking about the homework or sharing notes. So please, if you have any advice, do give me!

1gbbbf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gbbbf1/it_bothers_me_that_my_bf_is_hanging_out_with_my/,It bothers me that my bf is hanging out with my female friend without me,"I (F22) have been going out with my boyfriend (M22) for the past two years and even recently moved in with him. Ever since I introduced him to my old high school friend, who I’ve known for 8 years now, he’s been borderline obsessed with hanging out with her more. I only introduced them before the summer when she hosted a drinks at her place. We’ve only seen her 1 more time since that hang out. 

My friend has been in a long-term relationship for several years and lives with her boyfriend too. But it just bothers me that my boyfriend keeps asking about her and wants us to arrange plans even if it inconveniences me e.g. wanting to host a dinner after I told him I wanted that evening free. Part of the reason why I feel like he’s obsessed with talking to her is because she went to Oxford and it is his intellectual dream to go there.

Today was the tipping point causing me to make this post. I came home slightly late from work and was under the impression that we were eating together. Earlier he mentioned that he would be out getting a coffee but said he would be back for dinner. He calls me saying that he’s with her and will continue to be with her for the next hour as they wait for her boyfriend. Then he suggests that I come back into the city to have dinner with them, as my friend suggested it. I say no because I’m tired from work and because we have that dinner planned for Sunday anyway. So he just asks me if it’s fine for him to stay out - which is not really an “ask” more so just telling me. 

Literally, I could not care less about what happens. My friend is really smart and interesting, so I hate being insecure like this. I just feel weird as this is the only female friend that he has ever been wanting to hang out with so badly. ",6,1729798654.0,TwoXChromosomes,3,0.75,False

I just wanted to muse on my first ever muay thai class today.

Background: I'm a male in my early 30s who probably hasn't done any kind of exercise in the past 10 years.  I knew my cardio was bad because going up a couple flights of stairs at work was enough to get me very tired.

I went to my first class today - after 2 minutes of jump rope I was completely exhausted. I had to go on to do jumping jacks and burpees and I barely managed with significant breaks. The pad work was really fun though. No idea how I survived the hour session.

Immediately after I left the gym, I went on to throw up 3 times. I hadn't eaten anything that day and only drank a coffee beforehand. I drank a Gatorade after and felt much better. Despite this I can't wait for my next session and I will be going back.

I guess I just wanted to ask if vomiting after amuay thai session is common? Did I just over-exert myself (definitely the hardest workout I have ever done and I pushed myself as hard as I could). Is there any tricks I can do to not immediately vomit after a session? Will this improve over time?

Thanks!!

1gbb6ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/detrans/comments/1gbb6ar/im_cooked_and_totally_lost/,I'm cooked and totally lost,"I'll start from the very beginning.

Everything grew gradually. I was never feminine and never felt like I was. Even in kindergarten, I remember that I was always alien to the rules associated with the female gender. My young mind tried to escape this by choosing the role of an animal rather than a human in games. As I grew older and became more familiar with human culture and the rules shaped over centuries, I began to imitate what I saw in pictures and movies, dreaming of love, a family, and children. A young child couldn't comprehend the concept of love, so I often fell victim to cruel jokes about feelings. ""I love you!""—an empty phrase meant to make me fall for it, only for people to laugh and make me look like a fool. By the age of 11, these words were even used in attempts to coerce me into sexual contact, which, thankfully, I never agreed to. Even my attempts with girls ended in disappointment. By the age of 12, I started noticing that everyone was changing in one way or another, and it brought me pain. At some point, I realized I wanted to look different, that something felt... strangely wrong. I would have meltdowns, during which I scratched my face, literally wanting to tear it off. I hated it. I hated my body. The simple act of taking a shower caused me unbearable emotional pain, so I began washing only in parts. My parents refused to listen to me, dismissing me as just a foolish child who hadn’t seen life.

Later, I got hold of a chest binder. I lived in it. I almost never took it off for nearly five years. I slept in it, showered in it. I even went to the bathhouse in it. To me, it became a part of my body. This took a toll. In 2022, I ended up in the hospital because I needed emergency surgery for a breast cyst. When I had to take off the binder before the operation, I, as an adult, clung to my mother and cried uncontrollably, sobbing even on the operating table. During one of the days I was there, a psychologist came to see me. They noticed that something was wrong. My appearance, my gaze, my words, and my behavior. I couldn’t say the name I was given at birth. I would fall silent, not knowing what to say, how to address myself. As if the words were ripped out of context. I was referred to a psychiatrist who gave me a final diagnosis and convinced my parents of the seriousness of my problems. They began trying to accept me, to listen. Since then, I’ve been actively taking antidepressants, but none of them made me feel fully ""normal."" I was informed that transitioning was only possible after the age of 18, but until then, I was prescribed hormone blockers. Like many people here, I’m no exception—I also thought I was putting my life on pause because social interactions were torture for me. Every time I tried to admit to myself that I wasn't a fully ""normal"" guy, that my voice and appearance were different, people always felt the need to get under my skin, to convince me I’d become a monster that no one would love, that I’d never be whole, that I was an idiot and an empty shell, and that my feelings were just made up. Every time, this would push me into deep apathy, and before that, I'd have intense breakdowns where I’d lose touch with reality, unable to recognize my own hands or even my face in the mirror. It was as if the emotional walls I’d built over the years had been shattered, and now I was on my knees, trying to pick up the pieces of my sanity. When I thought it would pass, I’d be hit by a wave of black envy just at the sight of a child—because they could just live, while I was forced to destroy and disfigure myself just to understand who I was and to stop wanting to smash my own bones with a hammer. I isolated myself. Switched to homeschooling, and eventually, I gave up on school altogether. I stopped leaving the house. I still don’t go out much, except occasionally to the store or for coffee, just to avoid going feral. I can’t trust anyone, I find it hard to sleep, I find it hard to eat. I’ve stopped feeling like a living person, perceiving the world from the outside rather than being a part of it. Human interactions, concepts, and emotions are foreign to me. I can’t immerse myself in them—I can only see concepts, facts, and observations as if I were a different species. My family tries to support me and believe in a better future, but I’ve lost the rose-colored glasses I once had. I’m not alive, and I don’t want to be alive, but I don’t want to stop existing either. After turning 18, I was prescribed hormones, but I spent weeks too scared to inject them, knowing it was the start of a new life, that my body would change and new health problems would arise. (I’m paranoid and a hypochondriac.) In the end, I decided to go for it. It hasn't even been a month, but I was afraid to admit to myself that I felt lost on this path. I’ll never be complete, but there’s no other path for me. I like both genders aesthetically, and I’ve had thoughts like ""what would it be like if I were a woman for a day?"" because I’m attracted to women, but I’m not one of them, and I can’t perceive myself otherwise. Whenever I think the dysphoria is subsiding, all it takes is for someone to address me incorrectly or touch on a sensitive topic, and the tears start flowing by themselves, though I can’t feel anything intensely—not anger, irritation, joy, or happiness. The only exception is when someone hits a ""bullseye,"" reminding me who I ""really am"" and what fate awaits me. I vividly remember my first panic attack, when an ambulance was called for me. It felt like I was truly dying, but the paramedics didn’t care. They kicked my parents out of the room and started convincing me that it was all nonsense, that I wasn't a guy and never would be, and that I just needed to forget it. To give you some context, I’m a quiet person who is almost always silent, and when I do speak, it’s softly. But in that moment, I started screaming at them to shut up, I was completely overwhelmed. And yet, even then, they didn’t stop. My parents had to burst into the room and force them out of the house. I was shaken for days afterward. Sexuality is not part of my nature, and that suits me because it aligns with my worldview and opinions. I have no goals, no desires, no dreams. There’s nothing I truly love. I live behind a computer, pretending to be fictional characters, mimicking a complete, living person. I’m not even sure I want to fix this. I’ve simply become an aimless amoeba, rotting away every day behind a screen. I just... I... I’d like to live like a real, living being, not like the hollow shell I’ve become, as if I was never meant to live from the moment I was born.",5,1729798286.0,detrans,2,1.0,False

So I'm a bartender at a restaurant. The owner of the restaurant is a known alcoholic. He's driven drunk and generally behaved poorly because of the alcohol. 

Last Monday we had an incident. Partway into my shift it was dead- like 2 tables and nobody on the bar side. 

My boss came in and went to the back office. And then he came back out a bit later stumbling into the bar side. He nearly knocked over a table, and he crashed into the bar, clearly, obviously wasted. 

He demanded I pour him a drink and I refused. He insisted and I tried to reason with him, I explained because he was drunk I didn't feel comfortable serving him and if anything happened I - and the business - would be in huge trouble. He started to get belligerent and angry and rambling, I could barely understand him he was slurring so bad. And he waved me off and said to just pour him shots. 

Keep in mind we are a restaurant - the hard liquor we have is for like mojitos and Ceasars, mixed drinks. We don't generally let customers rawdog hard liquor. 

I tried to compromise since he wouldn't relent and I said I'd give him the whole bottle if he left his keys.

He slammed his fist on the bar and shouted ""do what I fucking pay you for"" and glared at me. 

I was scared for my life. In the first place I've seen that look in men before.... I was alone... I genuinely though he was going to hurt me in that moment. I was shaking, and subtly preparing myself to be hit... 

I guess the manager heard the commotion and poked his head around. The instant the owner was distracted I walked right out the door. I left my keys and coat in the back, I just escaped and went to a coffee shop across the street where I had a panic attack since the whole experience triggered some ptsd. 

Eventually my manager came over, bought me a coffee, apologized and did the usual ""he didn't mean it, he just wasn't himself, he's stressed"" excuses they  give whenever he's belligerent. He escorted me to get my things and let me go home with pay for the night. 

I didn't see my boss much, but another server overheard him say while I was working ""oh that bitch is still here?"" About me. 

Today my manager and the owner brought me into the back office and fired me. 

They say it's because of my past disciplinary issues - I've had two write ups in the past. 

The first was for a series of no-shows. Totally my fault. 

The second was BS. A customer was sexually harassing me, I reported it but my manager wouldn't help me or kick him out, so I told him to fuck off (among other things). The writeup was for harassing and abusing a customer. 

They claim I had a pattern of disrepect they could no longer overlook and terminated me, but I think it's because I wouldn't serve the owner that day. 

I have at least three waitresses snd a cook who will go on record about his alcohol abuse. Do I have a case? What should I do? Are my write ups going to be a problem? ",25,1729798206.0,legaladvicecanada,19,0.86,False

While I am super excited to have some big flare and CME action, it is not helping me get ready to fly out tomorrow for vacation. There is still so much to get done, but when there is an X, everything else comes NEXT. I am going to run down the models which have currently been ran and I will fill in the few remaining ones as they come in later.

OVERVIEW: On 10/24 @ approximately 3:33 UTC, AR3869 produced a strong X3.33 Solar Flare with an associated CME that produced a asymmetrical HALO signature on coronagraph imagery. The entire event was impressive in all facets from magnitude, duration, CME signature, and after effects following the ejection. This event occurred on the E limb and as a result it does not have a favorable trajectory directly towards earth but the coronagraph signature and subsequent modeling suggest a glancing blow is firmly within reach. I am going to repost the flare details first.

* **X3.33**
* DATE: 10/24/2024
* TIME: 03:33 - 04:52 (Above X-Class)

* ACTIVE REGION: AR3869
* DURATION: Medium
* BLACKOUT: R3
* ASSOCIATED CME: **Yes (Strong signature, partial halo, very faint ejecta on the NW)**
* EARTH DIRECTED: **Glancing Blow Possible**
* RADIO EMISSION: Type II @ 610 km/s, Type IV @ 03:46
* 10cm RADIO BURST: **12 Minutes @ 5900 sfu @ 3:44**
* PROTON: No

# MODELS

**NOAA ENLIL**

[NOAA ENLIL - MAX DENSITY 10p\/cm3 & MAX VELOCITY 550 km\/s](https://reddit.com/link/1gbb4sq/video/b6tn9j9u1rwd1/player)

NOTES: NOAA is fairly conservative in their modeling showing a true glancing blow with only modest solar wind enhancement resulting. They indicate an arrival between 10/26-10/27. Nothing to get too excited about from this model.

**ZEUS**

[ZEUS CME SIMULATION](https://reddit.com/link/1gbb4sq/video/zv83ve4c2rwd1/player)

NOTES: ZEUS is usually the most conservative with density in the models that I routinely consult. In this case, ZEUS indicates a very dense and powerful CME and while still showing a glancing blow, this model indicates there is a bit more meat on the bone than the NOAA model. For a comparison, here is the CME from the X1.8 on 10/9.

https://preview.redd.it/k9lexrkx2rwd1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=be7121c828984a26a29f28949f16b0b859539011

Its an interesting comparison. The visual signature would also support that this CME is more dense than the X1.8 but obviously the X1.8 landed a direct hit. Man if this thing could have waited just a few more days, or better yet, manage an encore.

**NASA**

https://preview.redd.it/u14hly583rwd1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaa3022dcabc4acd2637e795469c0f2338e6ea0d

NOTES: Due to the format of this model on the ISWA interface, I can really only post still images of it. NASA is also conservative in their forecast with only slightly more density than NOAA and a similar velocity. It suggests a range of Kp4-6.

**HUXt- Coming Soon**

**CME SCORECARD**

[4 Entries Kp 4.0 - 6.0 with Arrival Time Average of 10\/26 10:42z](https://preview.redd.it/u9qmqwfi3rwd1.png?width=1881&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6f8d5b77bff3d5c0e91528c4f53a9e4d661db6)

The CME Scorecard is in line with the NOAA and NASA models and I do note that the confidence level is low at 25%. I think this is due to the glancing blow aspect and nothing to do with its velocity or density. As a general rule, its tough for a true limb event to directly impact us and that is reflected in the confidence in the forecast. To me this suggests there is more chance for an underperformance than an overperformance.

**CONCLUSIONS**

**While a big flare and CME after days of quiet is exciting and a welcome change of pace, the potential geomagnetic and resulting auroral impacts are admittedly low. I am very interested to see the HUXt model because of its lat/long feature that does a great job of estimating impact probability. While the coronagraphs and models all suggest we will catch the trailing edge of this CME, it is going to be difficult to determine to what extent. The ZEUS model shows a fairly robust section impacting earth but the two better known models are more conservative and so is the scorecard. I see no reason to argue with a Kp4 - Kp6 forecast. There is a scenario where we briefly achieve more but there is also a scenario where its more a less a miss. NOAAs geomagnetic forecast has not been issued yet but as always, I will continue to check the models and the latest developments and update this post as needed.**

**The potential exists for a mild to moderate geomagnetic storm.**

**CME Diagram**

I wanted to post this diagram because it does a great job of demonstrating that even though a CME has left the sun, the sun has not left it. It remains connected to its point of origin as it travels through the heliosphere. You can see the shockwave and the sheath that is formed in between the shockwave and the bulk of the CME. Once earth passes through the plasma, the embedded magnetic fields take over in a magnetic cloud type CME.

**Space Weather Update - Can we expect more?**

As you know, we had went 4+ days without an M1+ flare. The sun shattered the quiet with a powerful X3 and CME. Despite that, there has only been a single M1 to follow it. We are not seeing strong signs of growth from the existing regions and our hopes are currently pinned on the capability of AR3869 and its companions. The sunspot number is at a measly 104 and the 10.7cm SFI is respectable at 185 and has been increasing slightly each day, but none of this screams we are heading into a period of active conditions where 5-10 M flares fire off a day with the occaisional X. What we do have working for us is a giant mess of sunspots which may develop more as they cross into the prime earth facing region. Not only is the size and complexity present, but the history is too. These regions were rather prolific when we saw them cross our side last time but that has been a while. However, we also had a pretty full HALO CME last week on the far side and 2 days ago when I posted an SW update, I had attached captures of the Post Eruptive Arcades that were occurring at the region responsible for the X3. Strong PEAs often follow significant flare and CME events and is a hallmark of powerful activity. Even if we did not see the flare that preceded them, their presence a few days ago let's us know that there is reason to expect AR3869 to keep it up, even if the leading regions such as AR3863 and AR3868 dont show signs of growth and increasing complexity. Here is the last 18 hours of sunspot development. Note that due to the limb location, we can't make out much detail right now and its hard to tell whether the region has taken a step forward or back since the X3. We will know more in the coming days.

https://reddit.com/link/1gbb4sq/video/r00c0p219rwd1/player

Unless we see some organization and development from the other regions, we may experience periods of quiet with the occasional outburst from the AR3869 complex while the rest of the sun remains fairly quiet. I thought it was interesting to note that in my comparison of active periods between May, August, September and October that October showed the lowest rate of M/X flares per day but that 70% of them occurred in geoeffective position and a strong 0.55 X Flare per day metric accompanied it. In short, if we have passed sunspot maxima, we may expect to see more sporadic but impactful activity. This could be why the geomagnetic maxima seems to always occur 1 to 2 years after sunspot maximum. We trade a bit of quantity for quality as there are less sunspots, but they are able to build up tension and release explosively.

This is all speculation on my part. I am just having a great time comparing and contrasting and looking for the pattern while trying to be a solar wind whisperer. I think that is a new term I am coining. Who wants to be a SWW?

Well that is all I have for now. As mentioned, I will update this post with new information including new CME scorecard entries and the HUXt model in addition to anything else deemed relevant. In the meantime, I am going to get my butt packed to take a much needed vacation on a cruise to celebrate my dads retirement and successful battles with not one but two aortic dissections. I haven't had a break in over a year and I am looking forward to it. I will still be checking in and keeping an eye on things and the SolarMax crew will make sure to keep the flare event reports and content coming.

Before pregnancy I drank soooo much soda. First trimester I cut out almost all caffiene- soda, coffee, tea etc. Then I learned about the caffiene limit and how to keep track of how much im consuming and I got far too comfortable in the second trimester. I started drinking roughly two bottles of diet pepsi a day (the 16.9oz size ones). Not every day, but definitly a lot of days. This equals out to about 100mg of caffiene a day, so still well below the 200mg limit. But now I am stopping to think about other possible risks from drinking soda other than just the caffiene. 

I passed my GD test thankfully, and I think im going to cut down for the rest of the pregnancy just to feel a bit better, but do I need to worry about all of the soda I have consumed so far? Will baby probably be ok? I get ultrasounds every 4 weeks for something unrelated and so far everything seems to be going well so I feel I might be overreacting a bit lol",1,1729798080.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

1gbaxb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gbaxb7/teeth_staining_after_enamel_microabrasion/,Teeth Staining After Enamel Microabrasion ,"In 2016, I had enamel microabrasion to remove large white spots on my two front teeth that had been there since my adult teeth grew in. My dentist thought they may have been caused by an antibiotic I was given as a baby.

Until 2023, this worked well, the front teeth were very similar in colour to my other teeth. In the past year though, I’ve noticed that the treated areas at the front are getting stained much more quickly than my other teeth. I had a hygienist appointment at the end of June 2024 which removed the staining, but by the end of September the staining was back.

I brush with an electric toothbrush twice a day and visit the dentist and the hygienist twice a year. I do drink a fair amount of tea and coffee, but no more than I did in previous years where this wasn’t an issue, and you can see from the pics that the rest of my teeth aren’t stained anywhere near as badly.

I moved away from the dentists that did the 2016 procedure, and my current one seems unsure how to solve this. Would teeth whitening work, or veneers? I don't need shiny white teeth, I just don't want heavily stained teeth for half the year. I will try to cut down on the teeth staining drinks but it’s annoying if these two teeth are the reason why I have to do that!

Attached pics are me pre-treatment in 2016, in 2020 around 9 months after a dentists/ hygienist visit to show how little staining there is, and today. The 2016 pics are pre-braces, as you can tell. I don’t smoke or have any medical conditions.

ETA: the pics weren't added the first time.

I hike 5 miles 2x weekly with 1000ft elevation gains up and down and lifting 3x weekly.  I also bike when I can. I started this on the 1st before fasting and hope to continue while fasting.

I am also on Ozempic and monitoring my blood sugar levels 4x daily.

I also take electrolytes 2x daily and drink a gallon of water or more.

Do I need to moisturize my body heavily?

Hoping to get some suggestions for breakfasts, lunches and snacks that would be good to bring and help me hit that calorie minimum each day. I work 10-11 hour shifts, and have access to a microwave and a small amount of fridge space. I work alone in a small shop, so items that can be put down easily when a customer comes in are a plus. Anything with lactogenic foods included would also be an awesome bonus, as well as anything easy to consume while pumping.

I usually prep what I’m taking the night before or a couple days in advance if I can, and no time to eat in the morning before leaving, so my “breakfast” consists of grazing on things from the Sides/Snacks list.

All suggestions are appreciated! I don’t get a whole lot of time to prep with a 4mo, so some of the things are kind of guilty items that I know could be homemade cheaper/healthier, but we do what we can 😅 (I.e. frozen potstickers, premade salad, etc.)

And like I've gotten my period so my body is developed. I'll say I have a rather mature body considering my age. I used to sleep w my parents when I was young, but we moved to another house this summer. And now I have my own room. My mom's a lawyer and she goes out to parties w her clients n her friends almost every night. I'm fine w it, but sometimes she brings guests home, and expected me to accept them. The problem is I have school at 6 in the morning so I shower before going to school. If I don't I'll be grumpy or feel disgusted so I shower every morning. It's like my coffee or tea. And I'm not comfortable w anyone seeing me preparing to shower, Even my mom. I shouldve said it to her before she brought her guest this night that I don't feel comfortable having to shower w strangers. But I didn't n when she came back tonight w her guest n she said the maid to prepare the bed so that the guest can sleep in my room. I told her no she can't sleep in my room n went back to my room. After like a few minutes later, she came to my door n said that she didn't like it. I said that I don't feel comfortable w others sleeping in my room. The thing that made me say it is that there's three rooms in our house w master bed on 2 rooms.y brother's n my parents. So I told her that she can js ask dad to sleep w my brother in his room. N she can js sleep w her guest in her room n it'll be better than sleeping in my small room( I have the smallest room out of the three). She said that it's a hassle n that dad will get pissy so it's better to sleep in yours instead, also he's my husband n your my daughter you came out of me so you have no choice. I said that I don't feel comfortable n that I don't want others to sleep in my room n I want privacy. She replied that I don't need privacy cus I'm still under 18 n that I'm still emotionally dumb or js very dumb cus I'm still 11 , so I don't need it. I said that it doesn't matter n that I still want my privacy, n she said that you're still a fucking child n you can't choose, you dont need it, i gave birth to you, n this is my house.i mightve been a lil rude here, but she said whatre you gonna do in this room alone?(In my language it could apply that I'm going to fuck myself)N I said I'm not going to fuck myself she also called me a slut or a whore. I can't going to details cus I don't really remember them cus it was all a blur. But she basically said that I'm still a fucking child n don't need privacy. She was hitting my face repeatedly while this was happening. She punched me also slapped me(but I was blocking myself so It didn't hurt except the punches) she took my phone after that n went downstairs. After that I locked my room, n when she came back n found out it was locked she started to bang the door n told me to open them or she was going to do it herself.But I said that you're going to hit me anyways even if I opened the door so didn't open them. I feel really bad for the guest though. She was like 24 so she will understand, n she started to talk to my mom downstairs that kids still need privacy. It's been like an hour after that n I'm still crying, I'm sure my head's going to kill me tomorrow. I was going to sleep early. I think maybe I should apologise, I should've said it to her when there weren't any guests but she could've js said that she understands n next time she won't bring guests over but tonight let her sleep here, okay?. If she had js said that I wouldn've apologize n let her sleep. But no she didn't n when I tolde her I was privacy she stared to jump on me. That's all I remember n she's a great mom most of the time. But she's out there all the time js spending her life outside so I don't even know anything about her anymore. I feel guilty but like when I was talking to her about how she always goes out she said that ""i didn't make her happy like the girls she goes out w "" n it really hurts yk like I'm your daughter so how we spend time is gonna be different. So to make you happy like those girls you go out w, do I start drinking? Also I need help to explain to her that I need privacy. It's like talking to someone that won't change their mind no matter what. N she just doesn't change. How do I approach her to talk about it.

We are a family of 6 (4 kids ranging from 6 months to 6 years old). 

We are not a fan of a big open concept space and noise carrying is a concern. We want the upstairs and downstairs to feel like two very separate areas and not have the cafeteria effect.

Our short list of wants (dreams?):
- Expand kitchen and dining to accommodate so many people living here
- Larger entrance/ mudroom for organization
- Actual primary suite that is separated from other bedrooms 
- Another bedroom so each kid has their own (although I think it will end up being a spare or playroom for a long while while the kids are young)
- Designated office
- Two living areas so kids can hang out around the family without feeling like they need to be in their rooms all the time for space
- More storage

The current plan is 100% my own imagining, but I will be consulting an architect- just want a solid starting point.

Turning eighteen was supposed to be a celebration—a rite of passage.

My mom couldn’t wait for my eighteenth birthday, and it was two weeks away. 

I was less than excited when I arrived at the party, hovering behind her. 

The party was in full swing, but it was the adults who were celebrating, while the birthday boy himself sat alone, his head buried in his lap. 

He was crying. I could tell by his shuddering shoulders, trying to bury himself in his lap and make himself smaller.

Ethan’s father greeted me with a rainbow cupcake and stroking my hair. 

I awkwardly laughed, shoving him away. “I'm seventeen, Mr Harley.”

I was pretty sure he still saw me as a child. 

Mr. Harley was like an uncle to me. He loomed over me at an impressive and slightly intimidating height, dark red hair slicked back, always wearing brightly colored pants and long trench coats.  

According to my mother, Ethan’s dad was the only one who could stop me from crying when I was a baby, pretending my screams were lyrics to a song he liked which cemented my nickname. 

Personally, I just think my infant self was so confused by him singing over my screams that I immediately stopped. 

“Hello, Ruby Songbird!” he laughed, ruffling my hair again.

I inched away. “Still seventeen.”

“Dylan.” My mom’s face crinkled into a smile. “Congratulations.”

Mr. Harley nodded with a grin, his gaze flicking to me. I didn't notice, mesmerized by the huge cake sitting on a metal platter. I didn't see Ethan’s name on it, though. 

The little kids were running around while the adults stood in their own little groups, holding champagne glasses and whispering to each other. I noticed they kept shooting glances at Ethan, who had moved to the backyard, now sitting on the edge of their pool. Mr. Harley was quick to usher me away so he could talk to my mom.

“All right, my little Songbird! Why don't you take this to my mopey son?” he chuckled, handing me a bowl of ice cream, gesturing to Ethan. “I thiiiiink he needs cheering up.”

I took the ice cream with a nervous laugh. “Uh, what's wrong with him?”

Mr. Harley’s lips twitched, and he and my mother shared a smile.

I was expecting a slightly passive aggressive explanation to why my age group were all *bad*, and that's exactly what I got. 

Mr. Harley nudged Mom playfully, his gaze snapping back to me. “It’s an illness that only affects teenagers, turning them into evil monsters who refuse to do what their parents say.” He held out the ice cream, covering it with chocolate sauce. 

“Right now, *this* is the only cure we have. Ethan prefers vanilla, but one bowl of this, and I'm sure his… *symptoms* will clear up.”

I shot Mom a pained look, and she nudged me a little too hard. 

So, I took the ice-cream. “Yeah, um, sure, I'll give him his *cure*.”

Mom’s smile was a warning. 

*Do not push it*. 

I had to resist the urge to outwardly cringe. Ethan’s father was… a lot. 

Ethan himself used to be a great guy. We grew up together, bonding over our birthdays only being two weeks apart, so it was always me and him. He was the boy next door, the two of us growing up facing each other's windows. He was that freckled awkward little kid, and then, he made my stomach kind of flutter.

We started junior high hand in hand, promising to stay friends forever. 

Yeah, that lasted maybe two fucking minutes. Boys and puberty don't mix. 

Suddenly, he was drawing his curtains and blocking me out. I called him out, of course, and to my surprise, he apologised for being an asshole. We reconciled and our friendship groups merged together. 

But over the last few months, Ethan stopped knocking on my door and ignored me when I shouted his name across the street. When I texted his friends, and then *my* friends, I got no answer. 

Look, I was already a little weirded out by the sudden dramatic change in behavior in some of my classmates when they reached the big one-eight. Jesse Radcliffe and Aris Mora, Ethan’s friends, were the latest casualties. 

In the space of two weeks, the two of them had turned from obnoxious jocks– to– I wasn't even sure.

Was there a word for a complete change in personality/behavior? 

These guys used to spend their Friday nights in the diner, drinking beers and trying to hit on the 20 year old waitress. 

Now, from what I heard, they stayed inside and watched English *golf.*

Whatever happened to them, it freaked Ethan out.

He stopped returning my calls, and just went totally silent. 

At school, he shoved past me, completely ignoring my existence. 

Ethan’s mother called it “typical teenage behavior” when he and a group of guys from school tried to run away from home. 

They were caught, and ever since then, Ethan had become a different person. 

He told me to fuck off a week prior, and I didn’t like the sudden hollowness in his eyes. 

Ethan didn't look happy on his *happy* day, and part of me wasn't surprised. But hey, it was his eighteenth, he should have been at least forcing a smile. 

When his mother gently pulled him into the house to join in on the birthday song, he reluctantly dragged himself inside, rolling his eyes the whole time. 

I noticed him playing with a keychain, a little Pokémon attached to it, his fingers wrapping around and squeezing it for dear life. I was pretty sure it was a gift from Aris. Speaking of, he was keeping his distance for some reason, hanging out with all the parents. 

I did catch looks between them. Ethan, glaring at his friend, and Aris, grinning back at him, saluting his birthday with his glass of… whiskey? 

Didn't Aris hate the stuff? I vaguely remembered him throwing up on my sneakers during a summer camp out. 

When Ethan was told to blow out his candles, the boy refused, and to my surprise, violently shoved his mother away when she tried to pull him into a hug. Mrs. Harley looked hurt, but she maintained her smile.

“Ethan.” Her tone was still gentle, despite her strained grin. “Baby, blow out your candles and thank everyone for coming.”

Ethan didn't move, his face bathed in warm candlelight. 

I tried to meet his eyes, but he refused to look at me. 

I was only met with empty darkness, and a stranger with my best friend’s face.

“No,” he whispered, wrapping his arms around himself.

Ethan’s response was met with low murmurs in the crowd.

“Young man,” Mr. Harley spoke up this time, his smile stretching a little too thin. 

Ethan’s tone terrified me.  He lifted his head, glaring at his parents. “It's not my *fucking* birthday.”

I tried not to notice Jesse smirking at the corner of my eye. 

Ethan’s mother burst into tears, and my own eyes started to sting. 

“Ethan!” Mr Harley chastised. “Apologize to your mother!”

The boy stood very still for a moment, before a smile slowly pricked on his lips. 

I saw his body relax, his shoulders slumping. His fingers twined around the key chain went limp, and he stuffed it in his pocket. “You're right, Mom,” Ethan smiled brightly, but there were tears in his eyes.

When Ethan was caught running away from home, he freaked out, trying and failing to hide the conflicting emotions. This time, he let the tears fall, soaking the collar of his shirt. But he was still smiling.

“Thanks for the cake, *Mom*,” he said, before plucking a still-lit candle from the frosting and dropping it into his mouth. Luckily, Mr. Harley forced him to spit it out. 

“Relax!” Ethan laughed, “Wow, guys, it's almost like you don't want me to hurt myself!”

Mrs Harley was still trying to smile, her eyes wild. “Ethan, *stop*.”

“Stop *what*?” The birthday boy surprised me with a grin, his gaze meeting mine. 

“What's wrong, *Mom*? Isn't this what you've always wanted?” He started cramming candles into his mouth in a frenzy, choking on them. But that didn't stop him trying to stuff more down his throat. They were quickly taken away. 

After a very brief hissing match with his parents, he saluted them with a rebellious grin,  grabbed the cake, and planted his face directly into rainbow frosting before collapsing into hysterical giggles. 

There was a stunned silence, and I think both of his parents were on the edge of their tether, before the crowd, mainly the adults, started laughing, leaving me the only one who wasn't. Jesse and Aris were howling, the two of them slapping their thighs, like this was comedy genius. A shiver slowly slithered down my spine. 

Ethan was sobbing. Through his violent laughter, tears running down his cheeks, choking him. He shot his father a wide grin, licking frosting from his lips and chin. 

“I thought you *wanted* me to celebrate my birthday?” the boy danced over to the cupcakes, stuffing them into his mouth. 

“I'm having a great time!”

I started forwards to stop him, but my mother, who was joining in with the cacophony of shrieking laughter, yanked me back. 

“It's not our business, Ruby.” Mom said, shoving a drink in my face. 

“Sweetie, have a drink!”

I don't think any of us were expecting Ethan to pour the entirety of the chocolate fountain over his head, which set the kids around me into fits of hysterical laughter. 

“Please ignore our son!” Mr. Harley told the crowd. “He's just being a typical teenager!”

The crowd laughed *louder*, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

Ethan was self-destructing, and I couldn't bear watching. 

I turned to Mom to ask if I could leave, but she was already talking to Ethan’s friends, her lips brushing the edge of a wine glass. 

There were several things wrong with what I was seeing, and I remember trying to swallow down soda that was creeping back up my throat. 

Mom didn’t usually talk to the older kids. I remember her telling me to stay away from Jesse and Aris, both of whom she was now deep in conversation with. 

When Ethan ran away from home, Jesse and Aris were caught along with him. 

I wasn’t supposed to be watching out of my window, but I did. I saw a very heated conversation between my mother and the two boys. Something about staying away from me and leaving Ethan alone. The last time I saw them, the two were standing on our front lawn throwing bricks at our door. 

Now, however, it seemed like Mom was friends with them. Jesse kept nudging her like they were best pals, while Aris swirled wine around his glass. 

I couldn’t make out their words, but they kept stealing glances at Ethan and whispering to each other. 

Jesse and Aris didn't seem like the gossiping types, but somehow they looked comfortable with the adults, exchanging greetings with other guests and laughing with my mother. 

They were even dressed weirdly, swapping casual hooded sweatshirts and jeans for more formal dress shirts and pants. Jesse’s converse were already dirty from walking around in the foliage. 

When they were caught by their parents, the three were clinging onto each other. Jesse and Aris were dragged away screaming, and Ethan was pulled back inside. Mom caught me peeking, and she was *pissed.* 

Now, the two boys barely even looked at Ethan, except shooting him judgemental glances over their wine glasses. When the party resumed, the music was cranked up, and nobody was paying attention to Ethan Harley except for me. 

My gut twisted, no matter how many times I tried to convince myself that everything was okay. 

I watched him, still smeared in frosting, hovering over what was left of his cake. 

He was rocking backwards and forwards, unsteady, and I saw it– his fingers twitched, and in one quick motion, he snatched up the abandoned cake knife. I didn't like his smile, the sudden sparkle in his eyes. 

Like he was going to self-destruct even more. 

Mrs Harley, however, was quick to pull the knife from his fingers, and his arms dropped to his sides, his expression crumpling. She was surprisingly gentle with him, wrapping her arms around him and leading him out into the backyard. 

Ethan plonked himself on the edge of the pool, ignoring his mother's attempts to talk to him. She gave him a towel and told him to wipe his face, and he didn't respond, throwing the towel into the pool.

When Mrs Harley rested a hand on his shoulder, the boy jerked away– and she gave up, leaving him alone. I decided to join him, dipping my toes in iridescent water, comforted by the cool temperature. 

“Ethan.” I said. 

“Go away, Ruby.”  he grumbled. 

I shuffled slightly to the left. “What exactly are you doing?”

Ethan surprised me with a sigh, tipping his head back and blinking at the blistering sun. “I'm trying to figure out how to inconspicuously drown myself in a kid's pool.”

“Oh.” I kicked my legs in the water. “Sounds fun.”

Keeping my eyes on water sparkling under late afternoon sunlight, I offered Ethan the dessert, and to my surprise, he took it, offering me a watery smile. “Thanks.”

“Ethan.” I said again. 

I wasn't sure how to ask him what was going on with him, but I didn't need to. 

“I don't want to talk about it.” He leaned back, his mouth pricking into a smile. “If I’m honest, I just want to enjoy the summer breeze on my face,” he leaned over, tracing the water with his fingers, “Maybe go skinny dipping when the kids are gone.”

When he started spooning desert into his mouth, I couldn't resist. “Soooo, what did your candles taste like? Were they as tasty as you were expecting them to be?”

Ethan’s gaze was glued to his friends laughing with the adults. 

Jesse and Aris were embedded in a conversation with my Mom, the three of them drinking  coffee with the other parents. Ethan’s lips curled in disgust, but I also saw hurt, like it *hurt* him to even look at them. “Like fucking rainbows, dude.”

“Ignore them,” I muttered, “They're being assholes.”

The boy turned to me, his eyes swollen red. “Don't say that.”

“What? That your best friends who abandoned you are complete fucking jerks?”

I wasn't expecting him to hide his face, sniffling into his sweater sleeve. “You've got no idea what you're talking about,” he said, his tone hardening. “Just go home.”

I tried to smile, but my stomach was twisting into knots. 

I started to get up, brushing myself down. 
“Well, happy birthday.”

He sighed, planting his cakey face in his lap. “I've told you, it's not my birthday.”

Ethan lifted his head,  but he didn't look at me, his gaze somewhere else entirely. Lost in the sinking rays of the dying sun. “It's my Dad’s.” 

He shuffled closer, leaning his head on my shoulder.

“Can you make me a promise, Ruby?” 
 
“Uh, sure.” 

I felt my cheeks redden. 

When we were little kids, Ethan asked me to marry him. 

I said, “Maybe when we’re adults.”

Ethan was frowning at a pool floaty, his eyes turning impossibly dark, impossibly hollow, Something in my gut twisted, a sliver of ice cream creeping its way back up my throat. He reached out and grabbed my hand, squeezing my fingers. 

“Before you’re eighteen, I want you to do something important,” he said, his voice splintering. Ethan turned to me, his expression twisted with fright, with hopelessness I would never understand. 

I swallowed. “What's that?”

Ethan shuffled away from me. “Can you die for me?” 

Ethan looked up at me–his eyes were red from crying.

He was terrified, and I didn't know why. “No matter what happens, you have to promise me you will die before you turn eighteen.” he held out his pinkie for a pinky promise, just like when we were kids. 

I couldn't resist a laugh, but his expression was serious. 

“I'm sorry, *what*?”

Ethan averted his gaze. His hands were trembling. “Do you want to know a secret?”

“Not really,” I muttered. “Look, I can understand that you're scared to turn eighteen– that it's a big age for responsibility and becoming an adult, but it's also still *young*.” I shivered. “I'm not excited of the idea of leaving home and being a responsible adult either, *but* we all have to at some point.” 

I was babbling, trying to hide that I was fucking terrified of what my friend was trying to say. 

I rested my head on his shoulder. 

I expected warmth, but he was so unnaturally *cold*. 

The sun was slowly eclipsed by clouds, and all the warmth was sucked from the air. It was suddenly so cold, an icy breeze violently blowing my hair back. I wrapped my arms around myself. 

“Just… promise *me* you'll start seeing a therapist.”

I found myself staring into the pool, where the water suddenly didn't look so welcoming. 

“Therapy.” Ethan said it like a joke, tipping his head back. “Sure.”

*“Ethan!""*

Lifting my head, Lila Fabrey was looming over him. 

Ever since *her* eighteenth birthday, Lila wasn't acting like herself either. 

Like the boys, a key member of our gang had turned from a signature potty mouthed cheerleader, to a stranger in the space of a single day. She grabbed him and yanked him to his feet. Instead of hanging around with Ethan, she had spent the afternoon drinking with the adults. She wasn't alone. 

Jesse and Aris had joined her. “What is the *matter* with you?” she hissed. “You can't talk to Ruby like that!”

Lila had this weird mother-like tone that was both jarring and frustrating. 

“I'm fine.” I managed to choke out, aware we had an audience. 

Lila shook her head. “No, sweetie, what he said was uncalled for,” she said, folding her arms. “Ethan, apologize to her.” 

When he didn't respond, she tapped her foot. “Now!”

“You're making a fool out of yourself, boy.” Jesse said, shaking his head. 

Ethan looked paralysed for a moment, staring at his friends, his lips parting like he was going to speak, before his expression crumpled. “Not her face.” He whispered, his wild eyes snapping to all three of them, and then he was moving, stumbling back, his breaths coming out in sharp pants.

“That's not fair.” Ethan broke out into a sob.

When he dropped to his knees, Lila started towards him, he shuffled back, terrified. 

“Ethan—”

“Get the FUCK away from me!”

Ethan’s eyes found mine, and he sputtered out a laugh. “Do you remember our promise?”

I didn't move, my hands were trembling by my sides. 

Ethan’s parents were quick to grab and pull him to his feet, but he was laughing. “I told your daughter to die,” he spat at my mother, struggling in his father’s arms. “Because what’s the alternative, Mrs. Chase?”

Mom didn't respond, which made him laugh harder. 

“Well?” Ethan yelped when his arms were pinned behind his back. “What is the fucking alternative?”

By now, the whole party was watching his breakdown. 

Mom pulled me into her arms when Ethan was dragged away, still screaming. 

I shoved her away, rattled by his words. “What's he talking about, Mom?”

Mom didn't respond for a moment, her lips pursed. “He is… clearly mentally unwell.”

“Answer me!” His wails were like knives stabbing into my spine, his violent struggles, his attempts to rip from his parents embrace, only to scuttle backwards on his hands, and try and run– before Mr Harley scooped him into his arms. 

“Get off of me! Let me go! You assholes!” Ethan kicked and screamed, “He… he's not even my real father–”

Whatever he was going to say was promptly muffled by his mother. 

When Ethan was gone, presumably dragged to his room for a talking to, I tried to follow him. 

Jesse Radcliffe blocked my way, fixing me with a wide smile. 

This was the same guy who used to burp the alphabet. 

He took a step towards me, and I found myself stumbling back towards the pool edge. 

“He's fine,” Jesse said. “Ethan is just in a time-out.”

“Right.” I said, “Well, I just want to talk to him—”

He blocked my way again. “His parents are dealing with him.” The boy slowly cocked his head, his gaze drinking me in, as if for the first time. “When is *your* birthday again, Ruby?” he asked casually.

I tried to sidestep away from him, but Aris was behind me, his breath tickling my neck. These were my friends! But why was I so fucking scared of them?

Why, no matter how hard I tried, couldn’t I recognize their eyes?

“It's in two weeks.” I managed to get out. “You should *know* that.”

Jesse nodded slowly, his smile widening. “I'm excited,” he murmured. Jesse had zero concept of personal space, stepping closer, despite just a few months ago, complaining that I gave him eyesores. 

He was joking. Jesse and I were like brother and sister. When we played video games, he tugged out my controller so I couldn't join in. Looking at him now, he was a stranger with my friend’s face, a grinning NPC staring straight through me. Jesse lifted his glass, as if saluting my upcoming birthday too. 

“There's nothing better than seeing a girl blossom into a young woman.”

Definitely not something Jessie would *ever* say. 

Unless he had substantial brain damage.

I had an idea. 

It was a stupid idea, but it was an *idea*. 

Instead of responding to that, I grabbed his arm and tugged him into the hallway. To my surprise, he followed me. 

“Do you know when we, uh, hooked up in the back of your Dad’s car?” I whispered. 

His expression crumpled with *disgust*, but he nodded. “Yes, of course I do.”

“I'm pregnant,” I whispered, and it was when his eyes flew open in terror, and he stumbled away, quickly excusing himself, that I knew I wasn't talking to Jesse Radcliffe.

Jesse is gay, still in the closet– and would rather commit seppuku (his words, not mine) than be intimate with any female - let alone *me*.

I could sense phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

What the actual fuck?

I wouldn't put anything past our close knit tiny community, which thrived on youth. The parents seemed more excited than the kids themselves over turning eighteen.

I spent the rest of the party sitting on the edge of the pool waiting for Ethan to come back. 

I had a conceptual plan. When he did come back, we were going to get the fuck out of town and start a new life somewhere else. 

Party guests started to leave, the sky above me darkening. 

I was watching the sunset, pretty streaks of red and orange, when Mom came to give me a slice of birthday cake. I threw it in the pool when she wasn't looking. I kept expecting Ethan to plonk down next to me, but he didn't. I figured the boy was on an *indefinite* grounding; at least until he left for college. 

Mom was still talking to Ethan’s friends, and there was no sign of the birthday boy or his parents. I jumped up, shivering, and headed back into the house, slipping through the sliding glass doors. 

The kitchen was a mess, and I snatched up a plastic cup of orange vodka, downing it. 

I was busy staring at the cracked wallpaper when a sudden shriek rattled my skull. 

Ethan. 

Before I could stop myself, I followed his cries through a door I didn't recognise, which led me onto a long white hallway. 

This part of the Harley household felt cold, almost sterile. 

Untouched. 

“Ethan?” I whispered, cringing when my voice echoed. 

There was a door at the end of the hallway, and something was pulling me toward it. I remember it feeling narrow, almost otherworldly. I took slow steps, dragging my fingers down the pale white walls. I remember disliking the texture. 

It was too clinical, fake, even, like venturing down the hallways of an emergency room. When I peeked through the gap in the door, the first thing I saw was… red. Everywhere.

It was wet on the floor, pooling between my bare toes. The room was too white, with bright lights shining in my eyes. I don't think I had fully registered the wet warmth between my toes and trickling through the gaps in the floor tiles at that point. I took a single step forward, blinking rapidly. 

Ethan was strapped to a scary looking metal bed. 

“Ruby.” His voice was more of a breath. I heard both relief and terror. “You shouldn't… be here.” He let out a wet sounding sob, wrenching at velcro restraints, and I could see him trembling. 

I took another step, like my body was in control of my mind. I might have been screaming, but I couldn't hear anything. 

All I could hear was the wet-sounding drip of Ethan’s blood hitting the floor. The red was coming from him, slicking his skin like paint. 

Initially, I thought Ethan really *was* scared of being an adult. He was so scared, in fact, that he had tried to hurt himself. I could see the claw marks from his own nails, his teeth trying to tear into his own skin. But Ethan looked strangely calm, like he was meditating.

He twisted his head, and I noticed straps pinning his shoulders to the table. “Can you do me a solid and grab a scalpel?”

I found my voice, standing on my tip-toes to grasp for one on the top shelf above him. 

In person I hesitated, but inside, my mind was screaming. 

When I tried to cut the restraints pinning his ankles, he shook his head violently. 

“No, that's not what I meant. Please *kill* me.” He whispered in a hysterical giggle. When I checked his eyes, his pupils were huge– dilated.

“What did your parents do to you?” I managed to choke out. 

I was met with a giggle. “Parents?” He scoffed. “They're not my parents! More like my great, great, great, great, great, great–”

Footsteps sounded, and I slammed my hand over his mouth. Someone was coming. 

Ethan was still giggling to himself, muttering, *great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great* into my hand. Looking for an escape, there was none. 

The only place I could hide was— 

I panicked, dropping to my knees and crawling under the bed. Ethan somehow caught hold of himself, sobering up at the sound of his mother's heeled footsteps closing in on us. 

“Ruby.” His voice spluttered into a helpless sob that broke my heart. “Get the fuck *out* of here. I don't want you to see this.”

I wanted to, but the door was already opening and then slamming shut. 

I glimpsed two pairs of shoes. Heels, and white converse smeared with dirt. 

I recognised those shoes, though I wasn't sure where *from*. 

“Please, Mom.” Ethan’s voice was a whimper. “Please don't fucking do this to me.” 

Mrs Harley’s heel clacks sent chills spiking through me. 

In four steps, she was hovering over her son, and I found myself scootching back. 

Something hit the floor with a loud  *clang*, and I had to bite back a cry, my mouth filling with blood when I bit through my tongue. 

The scalpel.

Mrs. Harley’s chuckle was unreal.

“Ethan, sweetie, you know I'm not your mother. I have never seen you as a son.”

“Derek.” Ethan spoke through his teeth. “Jesse fucking hated you.”

It was Jesse’s laugh that sent my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

“Thank you.” Jesse snorted. “I wasn't particularly fond of the boy, either.”

“Ethan, that's rude.” Mrs Harley hissed. “Be nice to your friend.”

“He's not my–” Ethan burst into sobs, the bed rattling with the force of his squirming. 

“Mom, please don't do this.”

The sudden screeching sound of blades was so deafening that I slapped my hand over my mouth, muffling a cry. Ethan let out a single, piercing wail, as if he was trying to cry out, before he... He just… stopped. 

Everything about him stopped—his sharp, panting breaths and his violent struggling. 

I thought Mrs. Harley had shown mercy, had come to her senses. 

But then… it started to rain inside the white room? Ethan Harley had gone deathly silent. It was just a wet spot on my forehead, at first. I swiped at it, and my hand was bright red. My brain processed slower than my body. Blood. 

When I realized what was raining from the sky—or in my case, pooling over the edge of Ethan’s bed—the shrieking screech of blades started up again. The noise was so loud, ringing in my skull, I thought it would never stop.

Half aware, I clawed at my face to muffle my own hysterical shrieks. I don't know why I couldn't move. I froze, paralysed, watching fleshy white strips of flesh and hair dropping into rapidly spreading red stretching across the floor. 

My stomach was twisting and turning, my mouth filling with bile. When the blades stopped, I was sitting very still, my eyes full of bright red. I barely noticed that I was soaked in blood.

It was dripping in thick rivulets down my face, warm and wet and utterly grotesque.

I don't think I'll ever forget that sensation. 

*Ethan* was in my mouth, in my eyes, running down my chin. 

I couldn't move, my knees pressed to my chest, vomit staining my shirt.

“*Hello*, sweetie.”

Ethan’s mother’s voice slowly pricked something inside me. 

I didn't know I had my eyes squeezed shut, until gloved hands fingers were wrapping around my ponytail, and yanking me from my hiding spot. 

I kept my eyes shut, clenching them against the tears, trying to tug away from her, my mouth full of stale barf. 

When I was politely placed in a plastic chair, I sensed Mrs Harley crouched in front of me. Her breath tickled my cheeks. “Ruby, you can open your eyes,” she hummed, “I've… cleaned everything up.”

I did, against my better judgement. 

Prying open my eyes, I was suddenly aware of Mrs Harley swiping at my face with tissue paper. Behind her was what I was trying to escape, trying to pretend didn't exist. But he was still there, reduced to a limp body covered with a white sheet, his hand hanging off of the surface. 

When his fingers twitched, suddenly, something acrid filled my mouth. 

“All better.” Mrs Harley straightened up, fixing me with a wide smile. “Now, I know you have questions, and all will be answered in due course. But right now, I have a surprise for you.”

The woman turned around and pulled a paper party hat from her pocket, before placing it on my head. I didn't move. I *couldn't* move. I was still watching Ethan’s blood fill the gaps between the floor tiles. “Happy early birthday, Ruby.”

I started to jump up, adrenaline driving me to my feet. 

But then, Mom walked in. 

I screamed for her, immediately wanting my *mother*. 

But her wide, satisfied smile only sent me into hysteria. 

Mom’s gaze flicked to Ethan’s body. “You were careful with the body, correct?” 

“Of course I was.” Mrs Harley said, pulling me to my feet to another empty bed. She slammed me down, pinning my wrists and ankles. “Michael is just resting, Iris. He'll be up and about in no time, do not worry.” 

Mrs Harley nodded to my Mom, who rolled her eyes like a teenager. “Go and get yourself prepared. I will be ready when you are.”

Mom scoffed. 

“Oh, please,” she said, “Derek waited three days before his rebirth into his little brat.” Mom started towards me, her face growing monstrous, her eyes flicking up and down my struggling body. 

This thing had been wearing my mother for as long as I'd known her, and all that time I was nothing but her end goal. “I've waited so long,” she hummed, pulling at her own cheeks, “Inside this… ancient, stretchy trash bag.” she prodded at my face with her manicure. “I want to watch it happen!” 

Mrs Harley hesitated, before nodding, pulling on fresh gloves.

“Of course, Iris.”

I won't describe what my ‘mother’ did to me, because it fucking hurts. 

What I do remember is her savage grin when spinning blades started up. 

I was too choked up to scream, my body was stuck. 

Paralysed. 

But before those blades could rip me apart, turning me into a second skin, both my mother and Mrs Harley hit the ground. 

Before I knew what was happening, Ethan was looming over me, a metal tray in his hands. He was covered in blood, still dressed in the blue scrubs he died in. His hair had been shaved off, leaving him with bald, rugged skin held together by stitches. 

Ethan blinked rapidly, the tray slipping from his fingers. He looked confused, slowly inclining his head, before grabbing a scalpel. For a moment, it looked like he was going to drag it across his own throat. 

It *wasn't* Ethan. 

He cut through my restraints with trembling hands. I jumped off the bed, reaching to grab him and pull him with me—only to find, to my confusion, that he was kneeling on the floor, helping his mother stand. 

He didn't even look at me, wrapping his arms around his psychotic mother. 

When he *did* lift his head, his lip was curled in disgust, eyes narrowed into slits. 

“Sweetie,” Ethan shook his mother. “Honey, she's getting *away*.”

I had half a mind to finish my mother off right then and there.

But I got out of there. 

Aris Mora stepped in front of me, and I saw it—straight away. 

How did I never *see* it? 

Stitches, just below his hairline. 

So subtle, but right *there*.

I couldn't control myself, quickly shoving past him and running - as fast and far as my feet could take me.

I realized that day, that Aris and Jesse weren't just dead: they were hollow skins filled with monsters. 

Once I was far away from the Harley household, I hid under an old bridge for three days. I stole Mom’s car, with the intention to get the fuck out of dodge. 

I got all the way to the intersection leaving town, before headlights were blinding me. I expected the cops, or *worse*, my mother herself– hunting me down for what she thought was *hers*. 

But when Ethan Harley stumbled out of his car, I think something inside me snapped in two. 

It was his expression. He looked like Ethan again, wide frightened eyes blinking at me. But I could also see the stitches under thick brown wig, marking him as one of *them*. 

In my mind, there was zero way my neighbor, my best friend, could survive *that*. 

I had come prepared, obviously. 

I didn't know how to use it, but it was just point and shoot, right? 

I pulled out my mother’s gun, pointing it right between the boy's unfocused eyes.

“Why are you here?” was all that I could choke out.

He shrugged. “I don't know.” he kept blinking, like he was genuinely confused. “I was in my backyard planting flowers,” his face crumpled, “and now I'm standing here.”

His words took me off guard. 

I tightened my fingers around the gun, struggling with the trigger. “What did your birthday candles taste like?” I demanded. 

Ethan looked confused, his lips curling into a smile. 

“What?”

I swallowed a shriek. “Your birthday candles! What did they *taste* like?”

“Rainbows.” Ethan said, and when I found myself fingering the trigger, he flinched, throwing his hands up. “Like *fucking* rainbows!” He corrected himself. “Jesus, Ruby, can you please put the gun down?”

I did, letting harsh metal slip through my fingers. 

“I don't have time to explain,” he said. I noticed he was keeping his distance. “But I can get you away from your Mom.”

I didn't realize I was trembling until I was on my knees, my throat clogged with sobs. 

“How did you find out?” I spoke to the ground, my chest aching. 

It wasn't Ethan. 

But it was also *was*?

Ethan’s small smile crumpled, and he lowered his hands. 

“I snuck into Jesse’s house on his brother’s eighteenth birthday,” he said shakily. It started to rain, and I could barely feel it dampening my hair, sticking my clothes to my skin. Ethan stepped closer to me. When we were face to face, he prodded the scar that monster gave me. 

“There were four of us, and…” His voice shook. “We saw everything.” Ethan pretended to fold his arms across his chest, but I could see him trembling. “We were fifteen.” he heaved out a breath. “So, we dedicated every year following to escaping this fucking town.”

Something in his eyes turned dark, a shiver sliding down my spine. 

“But, you know,” he shot me a watery smile. “That didn't happen.” 

Ethan gestured to his car. He told me he was going to take me to a safe place. 

When I jumped into the passenger seat, there was a gun sticking from the glove compartment. But I knew it wasn't for me. 

I didn't question his jerking head, or his hands slick with blood wrapped around the steering wheel, every time he gingerly stroked the stitches still lining his forehead. 

He wasn't stable.  I could tell by the way his body moved, like he was fighting his own limbs. But that didn't stop him shooting me a small grin and cranking up the radio, singing along to Fall Out Boy. 

I found myself relaxing in my seat, my eyes flickering, sleep finally biting me. 

But sitting there against the backdrop of a rainy evening, I finally let myself *sleep*. 

I was hesitant at first, but his hand found my arm. It was warm. 

“It's okay.” Ethan’s voice was a low murmur. “You can sleep.”

When he pulled up at a hotel, Ethan tried to drive away. 

But I was pretty sure he was trying to get rid of the monster inside his head. 

I told him to stay with me, and if his behavior turned erratic, I promised I would shoot him. 

The good news is, we've had Ethan’s parents’ cash to afford us being on the run. 

I got a card through the mail, and I knew exactly what it was.

I don't know how she's found me. Maybe Ethan didn't murder his father after all. 

The birthday card was home-made, covered in glitter. 

*Happy birthday, my dearest Ruby! I'm sure by now, you should be feeling the effects of being so far away from me. I think we both know I deserve what is mine. I have waited 18 years, sweetheart. Do not make me come and get you myself. You have until your birthday eve, darling. Then I will be taking matters into my own hands.*

*Can't wait to see you again!*

*So much love*, 

*Mommy.*

Ethan tore up the cards and burned them. 

He stays up all night with a baseball bat to protect us.

I'm turning 18 next week, and I'm starting to understand what ‘Mom’ wrote. I've mostly been couch crashing, lying about my age and trying to finish my senior year. But over the last few days (weeks, maybe) it's like my body is rejecting me. It took me an hour to get out of bed, to even open my eyes, despite my brain being wide awake. 

My body is getting worse. I woke up this morning, and I can't eat anything. 

My arms are aching even fucking typing this. Fuck, it's like my body is screaming at me. I keep throwing up, and every time, it feels like my body is rejecting *me*. 

ALL of me. 

… 

We’re moving tonight. But I don't think I'm going to get far when I can barely stand. 

What should I do? Do we go home and face this *thing* with my Mom’s face, or run, and let my own body drain me of my strength? 

Ethan called me *Ruby Songbird* this morning. 

I know I promised him, but I can't shoot him. I can't shoot the only person I have left. I love him too much.

But I can't let him lead her to me, either. 

Please help me. 

Edit: 

Another card came. This time, she's intentionally naming establishments near us.

Out of the blue, I saw on her ig story a post about a certain song that I enjoyed and caught up. We grabbed coffee to catch up, and we are very compatible: common intreast, life goals, insecurites, our past, etc. We're very open to each other. Time line this was about 2-3 months ago and we didn't hang out much since, coffee twice, walked out dog, and I mostly chatted by sending memes and stuff.

Here the kicker, she has been in a relationship for a while 4 years. And recently, she broke up with her boyfriend (25M) , they were considering marriage and all. I know they had issues but I tried not to pry. 

A couple weeks after they broke up, she asked me on a date and we have been seeing each other for about 3 months now and are even planning to meet each other family during the holidays,

Now all her friends kinda hate me and blame me for ruining her relationship with her significant other. Granted, I do feel guilty. But I really can't imagine my life without this woman.

A lot of her friends she made through her past SO. They already have opinions about me, which it's their opinion and they're entitled to feel however they want, but it really sucks seeing my SO cry and depressed.

Dear Agent,

The last time NAMELESS PROTAGONIST felt happy was back in college. At a small beachside restaurant called La Brisa, he spent countless nights carousing with his friends, playfully antagonizing the owner ERNESTO, and staying out on the beach until dawn—memories he’ll always associate with the scent of the honeysuckle that grew in the surrounding neighborhood. Inevitably, this tight-knit friend group scattered to pursue their careers after graduation and Protagonist found himself alone in downtown San Diego, working as an accounting assistant at a law firm. But the memory of those halcyon nights endured like a safe haven against the realities of corporate culture, and he wondered if he’d ever find such honeysuckle-scented happiness again.

Now, years later, Protagonist returns to La Brisa for the first time since college to reconnect with ROACH, the ne’er-do-well member of his old group. He’s surprised to find that Roach, the consummate burnout, has found a new lease on life and entered the workforce. While he’s glad that his friend has turned things around, Protagonist confesses that his own career has stalled: the law firm relocated to the Bay Area, and instead of following them, he decided to stay and try his luck in the San Diego job market—a search which for the past few months has proven fruitless.

Afraid that he’s slipping behind his peers and going nowhere in life, he spends the next morning scouring job sites at a coffee shop, where he meets MELODY, an outgoing grad student who happens to also know Ernesto. The two hit it off, and soon Melody invites him into her own tight-knit group of friends—all of whom have very different ideas on how best to live life and pursue happiness. Faced with these new perspectives, Protagonist begins to question his trajectory and the value of applying to the same humdrum jobs again and again. Never confident in what he wanted out of life, the time is fast approaching where Protagonist will have to decide: does he keep hitting his head against the wall in San Diego, or be willing to start new someplace else?

Complete at 75,000 words, HONEYSUCKLE ON THE BREEZE is a coming-of-slightly-later-age novel about the perils of nostalgia, navigating problems of our own making, and whether we can ever truly find our place in the world. Contemplative and bittersweet, it is comparable to novels such as TBD and TBD*.* Other influences include the city pop music of Tatsuro Yamashita and Hiroshi Nagai’s dreamy seascapes.

I’m currently a writer for several \[PRIVATE\] video games, and I’ve previously written for the \[PRIVATE\] social media team. I’ve published horror with *Dark Moon Digest* and travel writing with *Traveler’s Joy*, and I’m the author of a story-focused travel blog. HONEYSUCKLE ON THE BREEZE is my first novel. Please let me know if you are interested, and I would be happy to share the manuscript with you.

All the best,

First 300 words:

The little restaurant with the red tile roof stood squatly between the ocean and the lagoon. Simple and serene, it resided on a narrow strand—not quite an isthmus, not quite a peninsula—consisting of a clean beach and a drowsy old highway half-buried in the sand. A few shaggy palm trees towered overhead, pleasantly ruffled by the mellow Pacific breeze from which La Brisa drew its name. On most days there was little else in the sky, save for the occasional stray cloud floating above the sage scrub-covered hills to the east. It was an idyllic stretch of coastline—some might even call it paradise. But despite all its bountiful natural assets—the quiet shoreline, the windswept palms, the easy temperature that kept its windows open all year long—what La Brisa most had going for it was its beer.

Why the beer at La Brisa was so much better than anyplace else, we never found out. Whenever we asked Ernesto about it he would complain that we were talking too much and drinking too little. The few times we pressed him on the subject, he’d answer something vague about keeping the keg tubing clean. But we always felt he was keeping the secret from us.

Ernesto had owned and operated La Brisa ever since his father, Ernesto Sr., passed away from heart failure back in the nineties. We knew this because he never stopped talking about it.

“I’m going to go just like Papa,” he often muttered as he poured our rounds, his salt-stained face reddening from the friction of grief and anger. “Who is the one paying here, me or you punks? I take your money but you take days off my life.”

Whenever it got like this, which was typically on the far side of midnight, we’d toast to Ernesto, our five glasses clashing against each other in unison, and drink to his good health, his good name, and his good beer.",1,1729797189.0,PubTips,0,0.67,False

i'm tapering off 5 mg at a time and i know full well i get discontinuation syndrome very fast. after the first 5 mg it went pretty well, i just got a little dizzy and it got better after just a few days (decided to keep going with 15 mg for about 2 weeks anyway to not taper too fast) but now i lowered my dose to 10 mg and I've basically become a zombie.

what i'm wondering is if there's anything i can do against the nausea or how long it usually takes for it to go away. i really need to be able to work again soon.

I start feeling dizzy and my heart races. I feel anxious in many many social situations even asking for a coffee at the coffee shop. So since it has been so hard for me to finish school, my therapist suggested that I ask my psychiatrist to write my diagnosis and the difficulties i’m facing right now, so I can send it to college administration and have what we call “special status”. It’s like I’ll have a different approach at classes and deadlines. This option gives me a peace of mind. It’s been really hard for me to force myself to work like others and when I can’t do it, I can’t stop judging myself which makes it even harder for me to deal with. What do you think?

I gave her an ultimatum after the coffee situation (wherein she basically sat and argued with me about how she should be able to give my daughter coffee). I should've cut her off then, instead of giving it another chance, but I was naive.

I was only just barely was able to stop her with the vodka redbull. 

She is now cut off and im no contact, but the issue is I have no proof that she did those things. The only thing I have is the text where I told her if she gives my daughter anything I don't approve of again, she is cut off. And she replied ""k"". That was before the vodka redbull incident. 

In Utah, how likely is it that she'll get grandparent rights? 

For reference, I'm not with my daughter's dad anymore, but he's a very involved and loving father. He has 40% custody and is an amazing father. I'm obviously very involved too. My mother has never been with my baby alone.

Does she have a chance? 

To say I'm deeply disappointed in how she acted and that my heart is broken is an understatement. I lost my mom forever. But my daughter's safety is more important always.

Looking for a study buddy to level up our DevOps game together. Been teaching myself AWS/Azure basics and getting into Infrastructure as Code, but could really use a partner to keep the momentum going and brainstorm with. Major bonus if you're already familiar with tools like Terraform or Ansible, but complete beginners are totally welcome too - we can figure out these YAML files together lol.

Also trying to wrap my head around CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration - Kubernetes makes my brain hurt sometimes ngl. Would be super dope to have someone to pair-program with, especially when trying to figure out why that one pod keeps CrashLooping for the 100th time.

Solo-studying DevOps can get pretty isolating. Way better when you've got someone to celebrate with after finally getting that Jenkins pipeline working after 47 attempts, yk?

Hit me up if you want to be study partners! We can do hands-on labs together, practice for cloud certs, or just commiserate about how Docker containers keep dying for no apparent reason. I'm down for whatever!

Extra points if you:
- Can explain networking concepts without making me cry
- Share my love for automating literally everything
- Are willing to take turns buying coffee while we debug production issues in our test environments

Must have a sense of humor about accidentally deleting resources and a high tolerance for staring at CloudWatch logs until our eyes blur 😅

Let's fail fast and learn faster together!

1gbaidn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbaidn/is_there_some_underground_society_for_sleepwalkers/,Is there some underground society for sleepwalkers?,"Look I know it’s a wild question to ask but I’ve been documenting very odd occurrences where I’m staying. It’s all been going well up until last night when I saw a sporadic line of what appears to be sleep-walking people heading towards the mountains at 1:00 A.M. The problem is, I woke up in a different bed.



For context, my name is Ted Mullaney and I work in freelance coding (with writing on the side) which allows me to do my job remotely from anywhere in the U.S. Lately, I’ve been on a sort of “work trip"" (really I just chose to live here for a while) up to a little spot on the west coast . I’m staying in a nice two story micro-cabin I rented online for a few months and I’m on my 3rd day staying here. I sleep in the upstairs loft which contains two beds and a nightstand in the middle with an alarm clock resting on it. My room's gable window outlooks the north to see the highway intersecting the vast ocean on the left and the gradually rising mountains on the right. The only thing separating them besides the fog shrouded road is the looming trees that stand like monolithic creatures.



Yesterday I set out to explore a little in the morning. Walking a little more than I needed to, I found myself strolling through the village around 3.5 miles south from my place. The locals owning the small shops greeted the passing tourists with warm grins but when I introduced myself with the fact I was renting the cabin up the way, their friendly tourist-trapping smirks fell to forced smiles. This demeanor stayed with me in all of the shops until my eventual entry to an almost empty cafe called ‘Furry Rick’s Fuzzy Scones’. I sat down in a booth next to a table of a couple that looked worn from hiking. 



“Hi! Where are you coming from, stranger?” a young waitress energetically said as she wiped down the table to the left of the couple.



“Well I’m actually up here for a few months, I rented a cabin up the way but I won’t be pestering this little town too much.” I said, jokingly. 



She didn’t laugh at my joke. “You rented the McCluskey’s place up in Caramel point?” She said.



“Yeah, I mean I am just finding out it’s called Caramel point but yeah I got it from a Janine McCluskey. Do you know her?” 



“Yeah, those McCluskey’s – sad story. I don’t know if you know what happened up there but it’s something that shook this town up a little. Poor Janine-” She sighed a little as she obviously fought to keep her spirit high for the customers. I could see her nametag said manda but it looked as if there should have been an A in front of it. At this point, the couple with the matching rosy cheeks were listening in without any bashfulness. As I was about to, now very worryingly, ask what happened so that I know I’m not being haunted by some ghost of McCluskey someone started speaking.



“What happened to him?” The woman hiker asked. “We heard in the souvenir shop that someone mentioned that last name over there too. Something about a missing case.”



“Yeah, did someone go missing around here?” The man asked.



At this point I was sat there listening to a stolen conversation with Robert and Melissa, 2 hikers from SoCal who were just up here for a couple days at the campsite around the village. Amanda, now fully invested in telling the town’s tragedy that happened just one year before, sat down with the couple.



“Well this wasn’t really a missing person’s case as he had been seen by some of the townsfolk around 11 at night driving downwards with his station wagon. We all know it had been hard on the family after Janine’s mother had gone into a sort of dissociated state from the passing of their other daughter Lindsay. Anyway, apparently Ron just up and abandoned his catatonic wife and left his daughter to pick up the pieces of that poor family.”



“Jesus, what a horrible guy.” Said Robert. 



“Yea,” Amanda softly replied. “But anyway, a lot of the people around here were reminded of when Lindsay went missing because of Ron so it’s kind of been the talk of the town. News that big tends to stick around for a while in places like this.”



“I thought you said the daughter passed?” I said, finally being able to speak.



“Well everyone just assumes so. A 4-year-old girl goes missing in these woods, everyone searches for months but there’s a point where everyone has to come to assume what we didn’t want to.” Amanda stated.



The formerly lively couple and I had a long conversation about where we were coming from and what brought us specifically to this area of Oregon. I told them about my work and how I came up here for some inspiration for my new book and they were taunting my fearlessness of living alone for months because of the famous creature living in the woods. They explained to me what the villagers told them about the knock-off bigfoot that lurks around their woods, Furry Rick. We laughed about the large chimpish teeth stretched across his face in a smile in all of illustrations of him selling life jackets or strawberries.



A couple minutes after I told the couple to take care while they headed for the exit, Amanda came up to me again asking if I wanted my coffee filled.



“Hey you guys are a real big tourist spot huh?” I asked.



“Well we could survive without it but it’s nice to see road tripping families traveling up the coast so we like to put on a show.” 



“Yeah with Furry Rick” I teased.



She childishly smiled at the name. “Yeah he’s our guy. Our own little chupacabra.”



She acted out her routine to me about the inspiring tale of their first mayor who fought off a large beast with his eyes closed because the giant monkey was so handsome it blinded him. 



We both chuckled about this until I noticed I’ve been in town for around 2 and a half hours so I said my farewell and headed home.



Walking back on the road, I was glad the morning fog thinned out so I could see the less daunting thicket around me. This lack of mist, though, allowed me to see the track I followed to the village. The fresh prints of boots scattered towards my cabin which was fine at the time but as I got closer to my house, I noticed the boot prints weren’t straying away from it. They moved closer to my front door. My boots matched into the shallow impressions left behind from someone else as I raced towards the entrance. I swung the door open to see nothing at all. After taking a few steps into the house and calling out to the small rooms, I circled back outside to wipe my shoes off on the doormat and that’s when I saw them. 



Symbols slashed into the trees faced towards the house. You know when you land wrong on the trampoline and your heart drops to your balls? My heart was in hell. It felt like I was frozen for hours. I spoke to Janine online and I don’t think she would've left this detail out. I didn’t notice them when I got here for the first time nor when I left earlier that morning. I write fiction, I know my horror and I know that I should’ve gotten into my car and drove. But I didn’t. The symbols confused me. Carvings like arrows and dots pointed all around the trees and eyes stared back at me. The thing is, I’ve seen carvings on trees in movies before but not like this. All of the depressions were filled in with a yellow substance. As I finally got the courage to walk closer to one of them, I scratched at the matte yellow material and my finger dug in. It was wax. 



I forgot about my fear as I sprinted up the spiral staircase to the loft where my computer sat on my bed. Immediately trying to look up what they were, I couldn’t find anything with my searches and gave up quickly. I know this should be the end and I know that this is immediately a nope situation but what happened that night is going to keep me here for all my stay. I need to search for more.



I was all packed up and ready to leave the next day but I couldn’t sleep. Who could sleep after that? I just wish I had gone to bed.



It wasn’t until 1:00 in the morning until I saw them. My stomach was burning from staying up that late. Sweat beaded down my head as I got more and more nervous for every twig broken around the cabin. I sat on the edge of my bed and noticed something, or more accurately someone, passing by in the mist outside of my window. On the side of the road, I saw a man with a graying beard and salt and pepper hair lumbering at a slow pace. The arched man appeared to be looking up at something, his arms hung behind. As he walked away I noticed his mouth was creaked open and his eyes closed. He was sleepwalking. I wasn’t too afraid at the moment as he seemed to avoid my cabin.



Confused, I walked downstairs to go outside and saw another outside the large glass window. 



This was an older woman, head suspended down and arms falling forwards. She seemed to be saying something at random intervals. I walked outside into the cold forest’s shroud and tied my arms around my waist to conserve my heat. I approached the woman to hear her quiet babbles. This one was speaking. I’ve always wanted something to happen in my life. I’ve prayed for something to happen in my life. Not something like this. She stopped in her tracks and stood at attention. She slowly turned back to me and beckoned me closer.



As I backed up I watched the old woman turn around again and slump forward to go to her destination. As I spun on my heel, I walked right into another person going to the same destination. 



“OH MY GOD. I’m so sor-.” I exclaimed, not being mentally ready for that.



The fallen woman sat on the cement for a while then got up to the point where I could see her face. It was Amanda. She smiled, still with her eyes closed, said sorry and kept walking.

“Amanda right? Right?”



She kept walking and didn’t stop for me.



“Amanda, where are you all going? Should I follow?”



I knew that you were never supposed to wake up a sleepwalker but I finally know why. I tried tapping on her shoulder to try to get her to wake up but she spun towards me and yelled in my face.



“STOP FOLLOWING US. GO BACK AND CLOSE THEM.”



I sprinted back. On the way I saw 2 more coming closer. I could see way more in the mist. Where were they all going?



I jumped up the three stairs that lead to my front door and shut everything. *Close them* I thought. I slammed all of the doors shut and put sheets over all of the windows. I finally stepped back to view my now inky dark house. But it wasn’t fully pitch black. There was moonlight seeping in. In, through the loft window. I wish I fell asleep. I walked slowly up the spiral staircase, hoping I wouldn’t see any more sleepwalkers outside my window. I didn’t see the sleepwalkers, however. I saw where they were going. A flame lit up the side of the mountain, revealing a concrete staircase hidden underneath the brush. Holding the lantern and leading their sleeping followers was a large dark figure.



I’ve never seen anything so disturbing.



I was eventually able to pass out on my bed. I felt safe in my cabin for once that night. I fell on the right twin bed in the loft. I usually love dreams of feelings and colors as opposed to story type dreams but this “feeling” dream was horrid. Nightmarish feelings of my body being used as a puppet and a weakness breaking me down made me feel as if the dark being was making its way from my feet, into my spinal cord, and up to my brain. I woke up horribly with a bad taste in my mouth and a sore throat. The left bed from the window was cold. The sheets were made up almost perfectly. I’m not crazy but I’ve never moved in my sleep. I immediately grabbed my computer and typed this all out.



If anyone has ANY advice please tell me. I know it’s annoying and I know this sounds stupid but that night changed me. I’m staying here. I need to know what it was. I feel even more stupid because looking back on this I’m not scared; I’m excited to find out. I’m going to head into town today to try and ask Amanda or anyone what it all meant. Maybe later I’ll find that staircase.



Please help me find out what this all means.

1gbadbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterTreatment/comments/1gbadbf/recently_upgraded_my_whole_house_setup_feedback/,Recently upgraded my whole house setup. Feedback?,"I am on town water in Massachusetts, but have had a lot of sediment since we moved in a couple years ago -- particularly when there are the somewhat frequent water main breaks, Have had a spin down (80 micron) and 5 micron sediment filter since 2022, adding a CTO in 2023. Those largely fixed everything we had issues with.

Recently had an increase in sediment due to the water company trialing some new EPA protocols using increased chlorine. Caused huge amounts of sediment and have had red-to-coffee colored water off-and-on since June. Our two stage + spin down handled it fine, but went from filters once every 3 months to every 4 weeks or so.

Decided to add some additional filters and change out the spin down cartridge. What you see in the picture (right-to-left): 50 micron (spin down), 10 micron, 5 micron, 1 micron, and CTO/5 micron. These are 4.5"" x 10"" housings and may move the 10 micron to a 20"" if needed to try and get back to a change every 3 months.

As I look to the future, I am considering a undersink RO and UV setup (proactive, no issues). Any other thoughts, feedback, or comments?

1gbad1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1gbad1v/traveling_to_the_japanese_orthodox_church_and/,"Traveling to the Japanese Orthodox Church, and faith adventures in Tokyo and Osaka","This past year, I was really grateful to be able to travel in Japan for around 6 weeks and dived into the church life with the help of some local Orthodox friends. Although I hadn't intended on spending so much time in church (seriously), one of my friends there roped me into the weekday services and helped me visit all of these awesome communities. I wanted to share with you some of my random thoughts and travel diaries from this wonderful experience.

During my trip, I ended up visiting the Holy Resurrection Cathedral (Nikolai-Do), the Russian Church in Meguro, the Romanian Church in Kunitachi, and also the Japanese Church in Osaka.

It was really delightful to listen to the liturgy in full Japanese (Classical style) and to see what I believe were around five Japanese priests. I speak Japanese at an intermediate level so it was a joy to actually hear the language in an Orthodox context. The prayers for ""Glory Be"" (光栄は父と子と聖神...) and ""Lord have mercy"" (主憐れめよ) were interesting and made sense. It was also interesting to learn about the word 神父さん (shinpu-san) when addressing a priest. Of course, with my intermediate understanding I didn't really understand half of the sentences when it all comes together in the overall liturgy. I brought some of my non-Orthodox, living-in-Japan friends to visit as well, and they also mentioned that the classical Japanese was a bit hard for them to understand. The many usages of thee/thou style pronouns (なんじ、われ) reminded me of Japanese anime. It was weird to learn the word 聖パン (seipan, prosphora, ""Holy Bread""), since the second half of that word is a loanword, which makes it sound like Japanese people didn't have a word for bread before the Portuguese arrived. 

One of the fathers there is fluent not only Japanese but also Russian and English. It was a joy to speak with him, even though he repeatedly said that his English is not good enough... he's actually fluent. Another one of the priests is a Japanese cradle Orthodox who is 5th generation, with his ancestors having been baptized by St. Nicholas of Japan himself. As an Orthodox convert, it was impressive to hear about people with such long spiritual lineages in the non-Orthodox country of Japan. 

The fellowship at the Cathedral coffee hour was very warm and quite diverse, like a mini-united nations of people from all over the world who found their way in Tokyo somehow. It was fascinating to speak with expats who had not been Orthodox in their homelands but found God and converted to Orthodoxy in the faraway island of Japan. Thanks to the generosity of ""A"" who organizes everything for the expats, we had a lot of toasted bread with cheese and endless tea, for which I was very thankful. I had always been curious about learning more about the interior life of local East Asian Christians, and there were enough bilingual Japanese Orthodox at the coffee hour that I could ask them many of my questions. 

The Cathedral bookstore had many mini icons and books and prayer ropes. I purchased some mini-icons of St. Nicholas of Japan to bring back to my friends in the USA, and I also got a prayer book in Japanese, which thankfully has furigana (transliteration) to make it readable for anyone. I was extremely tempted to buy a Japanese Orthodox Bible as well, but my luggage was already getting pretty heavy and the Japanese Protestant Bible I have at home has gone mostly unused, so I decided to skip on that.

Interestingly, in the metro area around the Cathedral (Ochanomizu), there are many signs in the subway that help you find the church, which is suggested more prominently than the colleges, grad schools, and hospitals that are in that area. There is a particularly big sign indicating Nikolai-Do cathedral at the subway exit nearest the church.

At the MP church, which was cozy and friendly, I hung out with the parishioners who were mostly Russians who don't speak English. It was only then that I really learned the words ""Batushka"" and ""Otets"" for the first time so that I could pay my respects to the priest. In general, the parishioners and I communicated in Japanese together, both our secondary languages. It was amazing and we shared many things in common! One of the aunties asked me if I had ""heard"" about Fr. Seraphim Rose ... yes, as an American, we know all about him, and I personally love him very much. In Japanese, we talked a bit about the books 魂 (On the Soul after Death) and 未来の宗教 (religion of the future).

The Romanian church was surprisingly mostly in English, and the priest Fr. Daniel was very kind and loving, possessing a great discernment for the truth while still being warm and accommodating. The church, which is not super close to the Tokyo city center, was very much worth the commute. I developed the opinion that expats living in Tokyo who speak English, and not perfect Japanese, should really consider speaking with Fr. Daniel for their daily spiritual questions and needs.  

In Osaka, the church environment really reminded me of the cozy parishes in the United States - the coffee hour was a mix of cradles and converts, locals and non-locals, eating together and talking in mixed languages with no sense of ""foreigner otherness."" In a matter of absolute insane providence, I bumped into two different people who were ""spiritual children"" of my spiritual mentors in the United States. That was an absolute shocker. The priest in Osaka, Fr. George, was particularly warm and although he did not speak English, we spoke in Japanese and I was grateful that he was always trying to ""meet me at my level."" Incidentally, I am Chinese, and so Fr. George showed me a monument in memory of a great Orthodox translator who was an expert in both Classical Chinese and Classical Japanese, who paved the way for Orthodox prayers in Japanese to be translated in a classical manner, which survives to this day. Later on, I learned that the seeds for the Orthodox Mission in Japan were in some sense a continuation of the same efforts that had started in China. It was also interesting that the Osaka Orthodox Church had a fair number of Chinese Orthodox Christians as well, more than I'd ever seen in the USA.

Sometimes, anti-Orthodox people say ""American Orthodoxy is a fake religion, just pseudo-protestantism,"" which of course I don't believe but the thought still sits in my mind from time to time. In Japan, it was clear to me that the local Japanese, the cradle Old World Orthodox, as well as the American expats, believe in the same faith as the Orthodoxy that was taught to me in the USA, and that many of the traditions, readings, and favorite saints were the same. It really illustrated to me the Catholicity of the Church, with similar piety wherever you go. 

I am still in contact with some of my church friends from Japan, and it was a real blessing to be able to go. The community is so wonderful that it really tempts you to consider staying there forever. I hope that if you are considering traveling in Japan in the future, that you definitely make every effort to visit the wonderful churches in that country and to see this flavor of East Asian Orthodoxy with your own eyes, the ripe fruit of St. Nicholas of Japan.

My 12 months of maternity leave is close to an end and I have spent so much time reflecting on the thousands of memories made in that time. There are things I wouldn't change and a lot of things I would. Hopefully some of my thoughts could help some of you who are earlier in your journey.   


• Maternity leave is NOT HOUSWIFE LEAVE. Do not feel that you need to do 100% of the housework. This is a dynamic we fucked up very early on. My husband is in the habit of doing barely anything and I don't know how we'll cope when I'm working full time again. I regret every minute my baby had to cry while I was doing housework.   
  


• It's ok to change your mind. It's ok to do whatever it takes to get everyone through the day or night. Co sleep, don't cosleep, breastfeeding, bottles, baby led weaning, pre-made pouches, screen time, dummys, it really doesn't matter. We've gone backwards and forwards on every issue you can imagine and ultimately all that matters is that you and baby are safe, sane, and hopefully happy.  
  


• Make time for yourself. It feels indulgent to pick up a hobby on maternity leave but it's a valuable opportunity you might not get again. I started one hobby when my baby would only contact nap to make use of the time I was nap trapped, and now she naps in a cot I have started others. It feels like an investment in skills I hope to share with her one day, as well as making me feel more like myself.  

  

• Be kind to your body. I tried too hard to lose weight at the beginning of my mat leave and I was too exhausted and it didnt work. It also affected my milk supply and baby's growth. Now we have more routine and spare time I have lost all the baby weight with much less stress. In the middle I ate a tonne of cake at coffee mornings and I don't regret a single slice of those.   
  


• Arrange childcare as early as possible. I should have chosen a nursery when I was pregnant and in a productive nesting phase. We left it too late and had little to no choice in where we sent her. If you can afford it, start them at childcare before maternity leave ends so you can both adjust - sometimes I collect my baby after just a few hours because I miss her and I wouldn't be able to do that if I was back at work already. We've also been able to work through the usual illnesses they pick up without it affecting work.   
  


• Everyone struggles. There's a mum out there with the exact same issue youre experiencing and other mums struggling with the exact opposite too. This shit is so hard. You aren't alone and better days are just around the corner. You're doing a great job.

I told my bestfriend I don't wanna hear about her relationship anymore. My friend Amber 28 has been dating Bruce 42  for almost a year now.  They just made it official July. Well this relationship is to say the least is completely unhealthy. Bruce is a virgin. Amber is a single mom of 3 children. She on her own has alot of issues. She lost her child father last year. 
Anyways, let's start off with her. She's 28, a single mom of 3 amazing children. She is a hard worker, she is smart , kind, and a complete people pleaser. She has Daddy issues, she also is terrified to be alone. 
Now this is Bruce, he is 42 . He owns a house, a car. And like I said a virgin and He has a major gambling problem. 

Every week. She complains about their relationship. Not feeling fulfilled, unsatisfied & not loved. She breaks up with him every week. & get back together with a day or two.  This has been a pattern since end of August. 

When they go on dates, he is frugal with his money , they share meals,. But then last month he spent $5500 at the casino. She asks for flowers and he tells her 1 flower in more meaningful, but tells her he wont buy them if she asks.. She wanted plushie, & he said he'd buy her one. He has yet to do that. Then, also. He refuses to drive her places. He tell her it is going out of his way. He lives across the city, she doesn't drive. If she spends the night the next day he expect her to bus or Uber home under her own expense. The bus is 2-3 hours , Uber is $50 . She's a single mom and really can't afford that $50 , including paying her baby sitter to sleep over at his house. If she asks him for a ride. He will act annoyed or cranky about it. One day he told her no. So I offered to come get her to save the $50 , and just buy me a coffee. She proceeded to ask him for the address for me. &, he sighed saying oh nevermind I wanna drive you now. He drops her off & then went to the casino & lost $500. Told her he will never be driving her home again because it was her fault he was tempted to go to the casino, because he had to drive her. Note he didn't have to drive her. I would of picked her up. 

Anyways. Note that he's a virgin. They haven't had sex. But she gives him head almost everytime they are together. I've told her that he's using her because no other women in their right mind would be ok with that. Especially not being a,virgin or having the act reciprocated. 

She tells me she loves him, and wants to marry him. I asked her what she loves. She just answers with I just do. I don't know what it is. I explained that love isn't just because. It is thoughtful gestures. Respect. & things you can actually pin point and recall. She didn't say anything about that. 

Anyways, I've been the friend that hears about everything. I've supported her, I've listened. I've gave advice. At this point, i am exhausted & over all of it. I told her today, after noticing she was at his place, that I respect her choices. But from here on out. I do not wanna be involved or hear about her relationship. She got upset and told me I was heartless and didn't understand love. I said I do & I will support your choices. I do not wanna hear about it anymore because it is draining me to keep repeating myself every week.. 

So question is AITAH

1gbaa1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/caltrain/comments/1gbaa1m/gates_not_reopening_to_allow_passengers_to_cross/,Gates not reopening to allow passengers to cross tracks and board after train arrives,"I think this has been mentioned here before, but I wanted to share an experience from today. I was early to catch northbound 121 (scheduled to depart Mountain View at 10:17 am), so I got coffee across the street and was back at the southbound platform by 10:14:00 am. 

The crossing gates came down just before I could cross, at about 10:14:30. I assumed they'd reopen once the train stopped moving, as they're supposed to.  

But nope. The gates stayed closed the whole time and never reopened. I was stuck on the wrong side of the tracks while the train doors opened (at 10:15:30), closed again (at 10:16:30), and the train departed (at 10:17 sharp). 

That was pretty annoying. Does it happen at other stations, too? I don't remember this being a problem with the old trains, so is something different about how the new trains trigger the gates? Or did this train just pull forward too far? Curious to hear others' experiences.

To be clear, this doesn't usually happen with the new trains. Every other time the gates have come down in front of me (with an electric train), they've reopened and I've been able to cross. Today was a surprise.

I guess I'll have to start being 5 minutes early for every train, just in case. That seems a little extra unfair, considering that the new trains have so often been late!

before i start i'd like to tell you what gear i have.. and that it's brand new (bought in june but didn't use it that much because i found it hard to get good shots and just life things came in the way). (Short explanation at the end of the post)

* Sage Bambino (in USA it's called the breville bambino i think)
* Sage the smart grind pro
* Normcore Tamper V4
* Freshly roasted beans from good local seller (high rating and often suggested)

Before i got the fresh beans i tried supermarket beans and stuff, and a local coffee shop's beans wich i thought they were fresh. Turned out they were not. but now i got really fresh beans. roasted on the 22th.

But now with i'm running into a problem, i just tried the fresh beans on grind size 16, and then grinded for about 14.8 seconds. wich got me a little over 19gr. I took out enough ground beans so that i had around 17.8.

Then used the single wall double basket of the original sage device. Ran the normal two shots mode on the bambino and the first time i grinded on like grind size 12 and then there wasn't any coffee coming out of the machine. When i took the portafilter out coffee splashed everywhere, and i cleaned the machine and all.

Then i obviously went up some grind steps until i came to size 16. it's flowing good, not too much and not too less (nice crema) taste was okayish. But... while it's pouring coffee out, coffee leaks out of the portafilter.. and that did NOT happen with the supermarket beans.

i obviously cleaned the rubber ring and the portafilter but it keeps spilling out, even on grind size 17 and 18.

What could this be and what am i doing wrong? i'm on the edge of selling all the stuff and just go back to nasty espresso cups. BUT i don't like giving up new things.

TLDR:

Devices are brand new, FRESH beans, portafilter leaking, wich it DID NOT DO BEFORE with supermarket beans. flow is good with fresh beans. maybe still too finely grinded?",1,1729796028.0,BrevilleCoffee,2,1.0,False

Mostly for crap sleep that tracks very closely with my cycle (ok right after my period, progressively worse after ovulation), night sweats (waking up hot at 3am) plus brain fog/anxiety that also ramps up right before my period. I realize that a) peri may or may not be the cause of these things and b) these are not my only symptoms but they are the most problematic right now. 

The NP ordered a blood test with the caveat that hormone levels are just a snapshot in time. So today at my follow up, she again noted this caveat, but also told me that the levels shown in the blood draw were all within normal limits for the phase of my cycle in which thwy were tested, and proposed that I start with non-hormonal treatment. 

The two recommendations she had were the SSRI Paxil (for sleep/anxiety but apparently also off label for hot flashes/night sweats) and an OTC supplement called Equelle. 

I brought up my previous experience with an SSRI (Zoloft) where it was great for my mental health symptoms but immediately killed my libido and made it almost impossible to have an orgasm. When I stopped that drug, my libido and orgasms came roaring back. So I settled on starting with the supplement, but I ended up crying in the car on the way home. And I guess I'm just seeking validation/sympathy here.  

I feel kinda silly rejecting a medication I know will probably help me in favor of preserving my sex life. My sex life is the one area of perimenopause where I haven't had issues (yet), and I'm really enjoying it in my first real relationship post-divorce. I have nearly eliminated drinking alcohol, drink half decaf coffee, and sex feels like the one thing I can ""indulge."" I don't know, maybe the supplement will be all the help I need, but damnit, despite my better judgement, I guess I expected to walk out today with a prescription and I hung too much hope on it.

Transportation: Tram( airport & other places ), Lothian buses but mostly on foot. Extremely walkable city.

Shoes: I contemplated two pairs of shoes but also wanted to pack the bare minimum, so my Asics gel did a fantastic job and dried up pretty fast even after rain. No discomfort / pain even averaging 30k steps each day.

Clothes : I packed layers, but sweaters and a waterproof jacket was enough. It was pleasant throughout - 55 to 60F.

Weather : it was mostly sunny, and the random rains followed by sun would always pop up the fall colors. Very picturesque. 

Stayed in Dean village which was a short walk to city center.

Food and drinks: No specific recommendations. Vegetarian and a teetotaler. I loved Wee Bonnie cafe, Dishoom, Pulse plant, Kochchi and all the coffee.

Itinerary:

Day 1: airport to early check in. Explored Dean village, Princes st gardens, Scott monument, sunset at Calton Hill, James Quarter mall for dinner. Highlight of the day: \*two rainbows & sunset at Calton\*

Day 2: Edinburgh castle(skipped the tour), Royal mile - St Giles Cathedral, judiciary building, high court, supreme court, Writers museum, Cockburn Street, Greyfriars Bobby, University of Edinburgh and Scottish museum. Tip: visit the terrace at the museum for  spectacular city views. Vennel steps for uninterrupted view of Castle, Victoria street. Favorite : \*St Giles, Scottish museum\*.

Day 3:  Dean village, Leith walkway, Belford bridge, St Bernard's well, Stockbridge, Circus lane, Saint stephens, Botanical gardens, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Queen's drive for views of Arthur's seat and finally took a tour of Scottish Parliament building. Balmoral hotel. Favorites: \*Circus lane, Queen's drive, Leith walkway\*.

Day 4: this was the day of cyclone(!) so canceled the day trip to Glasgow.  Had no solid plans. Went to the National galleries and this was a pleasant surprise. Great art collection. Could easily spend half a day here. Gardens were closed, so went around the city again as the rains stopped. Took a random tram to see Queen's yacht and then back to royal mile and checked out a lot of random streets and alleys. Winds were absolutely crazy by evening so decided to call it a day and bid farewell to this colorful joyous city. Its the bittersweet moment of every trip.

I got a lot of useful information on this sub, so paying it forward. Happy travels.

I'm quite new to this mead making hobby. My first batches are underway but I want to try something else soon. I have seen people use all kinds of other liquid other than plain water to ferment their mead like coffee or tea etc., and so I'm looking to try some myself.


My plan is that I will use some homemade cold brew coffee to try and make a batch of mead. However, it is virtually impossible to sanitize everything I need to use to make the cold brew, especially the grinder, so the cold brew liquid cannot be sanitized and free of unwanted contaminants before fermentation. I understand that in a typical mead people may want to stabilize it after primary fermentation to kill off the yeast and halt fermentation, so I'm wondering if that could be done before primary fermentation to ensure only the desired yeast is active. If so, then what is the best way it should be done?


I'm planning to use potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate to stabilize the coffee, as it seems to be the most non-intrusive way taste-wise. Should I wait some amount of time after stabilizing before adding yeast and starting fermentation?

Unite the Veilguard and defy the gods in **Dragon Age™: The Veilguard**, an immersive single-player RPG where you become the leader others believe in.

# The Options Are Endless

Craft your personalized Rook with a robust character creator. Choose from a diverse set of appearance options for Elf, Dwarf, Human, and Qunari lineages. Each lineage includes several preset appearances, as well as the option to completely customize your Rook. These options include the ability to choose the basics, like hair and face shape, and include many more granular choices that allow you to make a character as unique as you’d like.

# Choose Your Way To Play

Choose from three distinct classes: Mage, Rogue, and Warrior. Mages wield powerful spells to control the battlefield; Rogues excel in agility and stealth, striking from the shadows with dual daggers or picking off enemies from a distance with a bow; while Warriors dominate close combat, using either two-handed weapons or a sword and shield. Each class offers unique abilities and playstyles to suit your preference. Experience new strategic depth as you combine fast-paced attacks, parries, and dodges along with the Companion ability wheel to exploit enemy weaknesses and seize victory with devastating combos. Customize a combat style that works for you.

# MAGE

Mages rain down fury with spells that incinerate, freeze, electrocute, and crush. Some cast from afar with a staff, while others prefer close-quarters combat using an orb and dagger.

# ROGUE

https://preview.redd.it/xiit73sqrqwd1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b93f37403e41e6c1f12854c756d25da4341e05

Rogues utilize quick movement and reflexes. Whether wielding a bow or dual swords, they use powerful, precise strikes for lethal damage.

# WARRIOR

Warriors command the flow of the battlefield. Some lay waste with sword and shield, while others use a two-handed weapon to send enemies flying.

You’ll also choose one of six factions for Rook to belong to. Major players on the stage of Thedas, all of these factions will prove useful allies throughout your story. Your faction choice will influence your Rook’s backstory, conversation options, and potentially the balance of power on this divided continent. Learn more about each faction [here](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/features).

**Combat**

Combat in Dragon Age: The Veilguard happens in real time, with players making split-second, strategic decisions that can turn the tide of battle. Use your unique class abilities in combination with your Companions’ to prime and detonate massive combos that exploit enemy weaknesses and lay them out. Bring up the ability wheel to pause combat and see what abilities of Rook’s and your chosen companions will prime enemies, and which will detonate combinations. Stack buffs and debuffs to control the battlefield, giving allies powerful advantages and cutting enemies’ power off at the knees.

**Progression and Leveling**

Experience comes from completing quests, and the bigger and more momentous the quest, the better the bonus will be. Rook also gains experience from killing enemies and exploring, but gaining levels is most efficient when helping the people of Thedas or taking time to deepen Rook’s bond with the Veilguard. 

Rook’s Companions are equally important to success as the player endeavors to save Thedas. Members of the Veilguard each have their own Levels and each Level gained grants them 2 Skill Points. Each Companion will have quests to deepen Rook’s bond with them, and this is one of the main ways for them to gain experience. Companions also can gain experience through unique conversations and decisions with them. These quests and bonds are not limited to romantic interests; platonic friendships are just as important and in focus in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

**Exploration**

Throughout the story, you will go through many diverse areas, from the beauty of the lush Arlathan Forests to the busy streets of Minrathous. Veterans of the series have heard whispers in the past about each of these places in Thedas, but now you will actually be able to explore and experience them in-game. Each area has its own unique feel and style. There are several areas for exploration; each inviting you to delve deeper into the narrative and uncover the many mysteries Thedas holds.

While exploring the world, the Veilguard will come across many things to do and people to talk to. Of course, there will be new and upgraded equipment, but there will also be puzzles and lore! There will be ancient statues, letters, and artifacts left behind to read and collect those Codex Entries. There are also new modes of transportation to find throughout the world, including fast travel. 

https://reddit.com/link/1gba4oq/video/cw5f3n19wqwd1/player

There will be new ways for your Companions to interact with the world as well, with specific exploration abilities. For example, you may come across some ancient Elven artifacts for Bellara to Tinker with while you wander through Arlathan. Even when the Companions are back at the Lighthouse, Rook can use the Lyrium Dagger to take advantage of their exploration abilities. You may also spot Companions out and about, interacting with the world on their own. When heading to Treviso, we recommend finding Lucanis and enjoying a cup of coffee together.

I've tried and failed over and over again and have been really discouraged because of it. I have a history of substance addiction and eating disorders, and I feel like I've replaced alcohol/self-destructive behaviors with sugar.

Yesterday I binged. Today I woke up and felt a chronic kind of emptiness and just decided to say fuck it and binge again. Every time I do I feel like I'll get sick enough for it to be the last time but it never is. I feel incredibly depressed and awful because I seem to always struggle to break this cycle. 

I struggle with depression also and have been using sugar as a way to feel something. After I eat sugar I feel incredibly depressed, and it feeds into the cycle the next day. I restrict heavily after episodes with little success and it repeats itself.

I feel trapped. I just want to feel stable enough to get things done but I do genuinely feel as if I've let this become a way to sabotage my progress and it's ruined every aspect of my life. I don't enjoy being around people or my hobbies anymore because I feel disgusting and awful. I just want to be sober from this and honestly I feel like if it continues it's going to kill me if it hasn't already caused complications. I used to be severely underweight and sugar free so when I started binging again from severe hunger I have been using sugar to cope.

I don't know how to get past the cravings. I've tried coffee but I always manage to find a way to excuse my relapses (depression aids in this because it makes me feel like there's no point in trying).

I thought about having groceries delivered or ordering take-out, but both grocery-shopping and cooking are things I really enjoy, so I don't want to do that. There are no housekeepers (really not a thing here), and even a cleaning service is hard to find. 

It's all a bit much, even though I held ""substitute prof"" positions for the past three years and this is not generally all new to me.

We talked it out very quickly and are already laughing about it (because we're both starting to feel better), but it more or less boiled down to both of us being worried we didn't have enough energy to take care of the other, because we were barely able to take care of ourselves. We talked it out when she got home from work, we snuggled and I tucked her into bed (we slept separately because my snoring gets BAD when I'm congested), and the next morning we snuggled even more and enjoyed our coffees before I had to head into work.

I'm not gonna lie, this was my first ever time having a ""fight"" with a healthy partner where it didn't devolve into name calling, being passive aggressive, or not fully talking things out. It's very strange, but nice, to resolve a disagreement without feeling any less loved or seen.

I was wondering if any fellow dykes out there have any stories about what their first fight with their current partner was like? Are you guys able to laugh about it?

before i start i'd like to tell you what gear i have.. and that it's brand new (bought in june but didn't use it that much because i found it hard to get good shots and just life things came in the way). (Short explanation at the end of the post)

* Sage Bambino (in USA it's called the breville bambino i think)
* Sage the smart grind pro
* Normcore Tamper V4
* Freshly roasted beans from good local seller (high rating and often suggested)

Before i got the fresh beans i tried supermarket beans and stuff, and a local coffee shop's beans wich i thought they were fresh. Turned out they were not. but now i got really fresh beans. roasted on the 22th.

But now with i'm running into a problem, i just tried the fresh beans on grind size 16, and then grinded for about 14.8 seconds. wich got me a little over 19gr. I took out enough ground beans so that i had around 17.8.

Then used the single wall double basket of the original sage device. Ran the normal two shots mode on the bambino and the first time i grinded on like grind size 12 and then there wasn't any coffee coming out of the machine. When i took the portafilter out coffee splashed everywhere, and i cleaned the machine and all.

Then i obviously went up some grind steps until i came to size 16. it's flowing good, not too much and not too less (nice crema) taste was okayish. But... while it's pouring coffee out, coffee leaks out of the portafilter.. and that did NOT happen with the supermarket beans.

i obviously cleaned the rubber ring and the portafilter but it keeps spilling out, even on grind size 17 and 18.

What could this be and what am i doing wrong? i'm on the edge of selling all the stuff and just go back to nasty espresso cups. BUT i don't like giving up new things.

TLDR:

Devices are brand new, FRESH beans, portafilter leaking, wich it DID NOT DO BEFORE with supermarket beans. flow is good with fresh beans. maybe still too finely grinded?",1,1729794884.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

*Pulling up to a massive mansion, the sight of the Guardian Angel, Miss Amora, had a lump forming in my throat. Her hair had been pulled into a bun, her onyx lace tank stuck out of a fine designer suit. Staring at a clipboard with a fuming expression, something seemed off about her. The light had been sucked out of her eyes, her wet eyes widening at the sight of my wild orange curls. A man with salt and pepper hair leaned in close to her ear, his tongue licking his lips. Shuddering in his presence, a single tear slid down her cheeks. Concern dimmed my emerald eyes, his million dollar smile snapping in my direction. Getting out in my silky emerald dress, the old man was my target. Becoming someone’s girlfriend was my second nature, my charm becoming my dagger. Locking the door behind me, a bright smile hid her sorrow. This was our third month together and his death had reached its deadline. Flinching at him snapping his wrinkled fingers, she scurried off. Hooking my elbow in his, the tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Guiding me in, I excused myself to use the toilet by the kitchen. Flirting with me as he made his way into the living room, disgust had me shivering. Knocking on the kitchen door, a sobbing Guardian Angel had me rushing over to her. Being an assassin destroyed lives, her tears slowing to a stop at the sight of me.* 

*“Sorry but I am going through something.” She choked between sniffles, her trembling fingers digging into the wooden counter. “I miss him. I miss him with all of my heart. He was the first one who cared about me and I can never see him again. Fuck love, right?” Preparing our drinks in a broken silence, her shaking fingers slid over an envelope discreetly over to me. Opening it up underneath the large sleek kitchen counter, her bright smile returned to her face. Cocking her head to make her look more innocent, a pretty pink drink cascaded over the spaces in between the ice cubes. Staring at the pill with a disguised shock, it was one of her infamous heart attack pills. The damn thing showed up as heart medication but did the opposite. Wondering why she wanted to help out, a healthy distrust hung between us.* 

*“His latest appointment spoke of a bad heart and severe diabetes. I am so worried about him. We have to take care of him if you want a long marriage with him, right?” She chuckled lightly, her steadying fingers wiping away her tears. “Will you help me do that?” Dropping the envelope into my sparkling handbag, the shock of her giving me the reward had me wondering what those nasty rumors were about.* 

*“Right.” I returned with my natural smile, a bit of light returning to her eyes. “How about we hit the club to give him a bit of cardio? I need to dance.” The cadence of my southern twang irritated me, the damn thing helping kill person after person. Shrugging her shoulders, she flushed the toilet on the way to the living room. Thanking her silently, she placed the drinks on the fine glass coffee table. Taking her place by the door, a numbness came over her features. Scanning the room, it was my time to charm him into a more public place.* 

*“Can we dance tonight? I am itching to get out with you, cowboy!” I twanged with a wink, his hand rubbing mine as he sipped his drink cautiously. Granting me permission with an eyebrow wiggle, this man was truly disgusting. Shifting uncomfortably by the door, the younger version of Amora exited the room to prepare the car. The loose dark strands of her hair floated up as she returned with a throat clearing, my mark rising to his feet. Brushing past her like she was a second class citizen, he watched me do the same. Opening the front door, our dress shoes clicked onto his marble balcony. Tapping his watch as she opened the passenger door, a pathetic apology tumbled from her lips. Closing the door behind us, she plopped into the front of the sleek limousine. Closing the divider, his hot whiskey breath bathed my face.*   
  
*“She had a hold of my son and now she is my bodyguard and personal assistant. I love it when they get punished on the daily.” He bragged gleefully, his hand resting on my hip. “Do you think you can prepare me a drink of whiskey? I need to take my heart medication.” Knocking all but one glass over discreetly, he went into a panic. Switching out her pill with his other, my steady hands prepared his whiskey on the rocks. Dumping the shards into the trash can, he sat up with a big old smile. Presenting him with the pill and his drink, his knotted hands popped it down his throat. Gulping it down with the whiskey, time would be his enemy. This was the infamous Mr. Charlox at his douchiest, his hand resting on my thigh. Allowing him to brag about how he was torturing her, the sight of a club had me grinning ear to ear. The neon Beethoven had me rolling my eyes, the specialty of this club being classical remixes. Knocking on the window, his actual pill rolled out of my purse. A quick stomp crushed it, a bead of sweat forming on my brow. Neon lights flooded the limousine, Amora letting us out. The bouncer let him in, a techno version of Fur Elise began to pound around the room. Snapping his fingers in Amora’s direction, she stayed on her heels while attempting to hide a fresh bruise with her sleeve. Yanking me to the VIP section, a bottle of the most expensive champagne sat in a metronome bucket. Women in those ridiculous powdered wigs from Beethoven’s time spun past me in a shortened version of Marie Aintonette’s dresses, Amora checking her phone. Little children ran up from his basement, her finger tapping the screen until she saw them rushing up to the neighbor’s door. Tucking her phone into her pocket where she could see it, red and blue lights were soon to flood his driveway.  Prancing like I had to go to the bathroom, he sent her with me. Walking an inch behind me, her head nodded towards the left side of the stage.* 

*“There are no cameras on that side of the building. Spend the time with him and I will signal you when he is close to dying. Excuse yourself and say that your sister is having an emergency or whatever. Leave that way. I will deal with the aftermath.” She whispered into my ear, her back straightening upon him watching us. “Move up those ranks if you must but know I will help you out if you are tired of this bullshit, okay?” Touched by her kindness, she hovered outside the bathroom as I pretended to go number one in the stupid ornate stalls. This theme sucked, her tired smile greeting mine. Walking me back, the cushion sank as I cuddled with him, his bragging words returning. Glancing back every now and then, red and blue lights showed up on her camera. Sliding it down with a triumphant grin, his skin became sweatier than usual. Clutching his chest, his heart began to beat erratically. Rushing over to him, my heels clicked out of the space. Sprinting out where she told me, I was in the clear with a decent reward. A hand shaking my shoulder ripped me from that amazing memory of her kindness.* 

Lurch stared down at me in his uniform, my shimmering cowgirl outfit hanging off of his arm. Accepting it with a gracious smile, today would be my first S-tier battle. Wondering who it would be, his steady hand buttoned up my last button. Shoving my revolvers into my diamond covered holsters, an anxiety brewed in my chest. Making our way to the colosseum side entrance, a smug Amora sat next to a blind Samara. Her translucent dragon familiars acted as her eyes, her pristine designer suit contrasted Amora’s leather jacket style dress. Her ivory corset poked out of the top, her eyes meeting mine. Clearing her throat, Samara narrowed her eyes in her direction. 

“Hello, hello! My name Amora and I am here to deliver  the blow by blow action!” She announced with a devilish grin, the crowd cheering. “My fellow announcer is Samara and I am afraid she can’t see as well as she used to. Do you have anything to say, my dear fellow announcer?” Snapping her head in her direction, a sadistic smirk twitched on her lips. 

“Your whip seems to know that freaking answer, doesn’t it!” She snapped back hotly, her eyes glowing for a second. “Since my boss says that I have to cooperate, then I must comply. In my corner, Miss Masquerade is as bright as the city on a busy night, her feathers really cut into you. Every fan killed another man on the streets. Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.”  A colorful character made her way into the arena, her neon pink bun bounced up and down. Neon pink feather fans fluttered to her matching her shorted Victorian dress, every footfall sounding like thunder in my ears. Her matching Victorian style boots reminded me of a serial killer I came across all those years ago, her sharp neon eyes settling on me. Glancing up at Amora, the color draining from her face didn’t exactly bolster my confidence. Shaking it off, she cleared her throat. Dusting off my outfit, I was a rooting tooting cowgirl with the aim of a rattlesnake. 

“In my corner is the sweetest but deadliest assassin. Wrangler is sure to wrangle her into liking you with her sweet southern hospitality. Don’t let that fool you! Her bite is quite poisonous!” She yelled with honest vigor, her wink settling my fraying nerves enough to focus. “One strike and you are done.” Ringing the bell, her dainty hands brought her fans to her face. Fluttering them in a menacing manner, a silver feathered mask appeared over her twinkling eyes. Creepy masquerade music roared to life, the serial killer’s hunger for death making them that much more powerful. Twirling around the arena, horror widened my eyes at the bright pink feathers floating ominous behind her. Hearing Charlox take her spot behind her distracted me long enough for her to flick her fans, Lurch screaming for me to pay attention. 

“Feathers fly fast!” Samara laughed maniacally, Amora rolling her eyes while seeking a way to help me legally. “Die like you should!” Amora sucked in a deep breath, the masked attendees snapping their heads in Amora’s direction. Being a fan favorite, their ears hung on her every word. 

“Fancy feathers! Let’s be nice and not call for death every ten minutes!” She returned sarcastically, her palms slamming onto the new table. “Feathers may fly but so don’t bullets. Sweet southern hell is coming her way!” Her words inspired me, the mouth of my gun smoked with the rapid amount of bullets obliterating her feathers with ease. Cocking her head, a scoff of disbelief drifted from Masquerade’s mouth. Spinning around the room faster, the music sped up with each step. A couple of cuts would occur but I had to destroy her footwork. Summoning another wave of feathers, a flick of her wrists released them with ease. Rolling behind a wooden wall, a howl of pain burst from my lips upon twenty feathers quivering in my legs. 

“Looks like the Wrangler can’t wrangle that well!” Samara taunted with a cruel sneer, my brow cocking at her damn words. This cowgirl wasn’t out of commission yet, a quick poke around the wood exposing her simple dance moves. Amora moves with more grace, Amora winked in the direction of a bunch of holy rope. Checking my gloves, a rowdy grin spread cheek to cheek. Unable to move for the moment, a desperate claw had it glowing in my palms. Tucking my revolvers into my belt, the muscle in my legs protested as I struggled to my feet. 

“The great Wrangler rises from the dead to take out the masked freak! Swing, swing away!” Amora laughed lightly, pride glistening in her eyes. “Go get them, cowgirl!” Her words shot any fear out of my heart, my timing needing to be flawless. Making a lasso, a few spins granted me the speed I needed. Aiming it for her feet, a kick had one of my revolvers in my hand. Amora and Samara’s voices became background noise as a rapid release of bullets had her feathers shooting in the opposite direction. The rope curled around her ankles, the music dying down. Dragging her closer to me, her cocky grin fell. Kneeling onto her chest, the cold muzzle pressed into her forehead. A loud pop had her body decaying to ash, Samara banging her desk in a fit. Amora rose to her feet, her fist pumping into the air had the crowd roaring. Lurch scooped me up, his eyes focusing on the feathers in my legs. 

“You did wonderfully, my dear.” He complimented with his natural smile, his lips hovering over mine. Amora leapt down from her table, the crowd leaving. Ripping out the feathers one by one, one drop of her blood sealed the holes into rough scars. Cupping my hand with a triumphant grin, her words barely registered in my ears. Shaking my shoulders to get me to pay attention, the card into cell block M flipped over her hands. Where was her curiosity going to take her?

“I need my secondhand man to accompany me.” She sang with a spin, Ketchum catching up. “I have a plan since those serial killer demons are a real bitch to deal with.” Lurch kept up, Charlox sprinting up to her other side. Making our way out of the block, snarls and growls had me gripping Lurch’s hands desperately. Looking calm as ever, a shadow figure greeted her. Flashing the card, he bowed before moving to the side. Flipping it over to look at the back, her face fell. The card creaked in protest in her increasing grip, a low growl rumbling in her throat. Snapping her head towards the jet black demon guard, his ruby eyes quivered in pure fear. 

“Show me your most dangerous monster.” She demanded calmly, her patience wearing thin at his obvious protest. “Bring me to your most dangerous monster! I am the boss, right!” Clenching her teeth with the last request, the shadow demon’s form glitched a couple of times before he proceeded to guide us through a wall of thick steel cages. Stopping at the smallest one, bewilderment mixed with bemusement at the seemingly harmless size. Motioning for him to open it, the lights flickered out. Night vision cameras flicked on, her eyes rolling. Lurch complained audibly the moment I hopped out of his arms. Charlox stepped in front of me while I tied my holy lasso around my belt. Lilac lightning crackled to life around her body, her whip cracking a couple inches away from us. Flipping her dagger over her fingers, Amora’s sharp eyes tracked a shifting shadow creature. Horror rounded my eyes, the very monster that she was battling was a ball of pure evil. Taking a couple of cuts to her cheeks, a sadistic grin curled on her lips. Cracking her whip to pick up speed, the ball of energy squealed in pain with the flurry of strikes. Whipping the inky ooze off of her whip, a bolt of lightning stunned it for a millisecond. Stunned by what she had managed to do, the ball glitched wildly. Tucking her whip back into her belt, her fang pierced her bottom lips. Allowing an inky ribbon to flow freely, Lurch held Charlox back. Kissing it gently, the wild zaps continued  to slice up her hands and face. How could she stand so strongly in a crappy situation!

“Please let me tame you. I promise you a chance at a good life.” She comforted the ball in a motherly tone, a shiver running up my back. She had done the same thing for me that night in the club, her golden heart not leaving that much to be desired. Rubbing it until it smoothed out, a coo had the lights flickering back to life. Shifting into a shadow raven, the bird cawed unnaturally.  A violet lightning mark glowed bright on her chest, an eerie silence coming over the space. One by one, the monsters bowed in her direction. Smiling softly to herself, her finger scratched at the top of her new pet’s head. Clearing her throat, her palms pressed together. Donning her genuine smile, the monsters rose to their feet. 

“Here’s my plan with you guys. You are all going to be with masters. We will feed you and take care of you.” She promised sincerely, a snap of her fingers opening up the cages. “What I need from you is a protective service for my assassins. Those serial killers are fucking nasty. What do you all say?” Coming out cautiously, the horse from a dullahan caught my eyes. Galloping up to me, its milky eyes bore into mine. Coursing through the Celtic language, the word for night seemed like a good name. Oiche would be his name, his snort announcing his bond with me. An ivory horseshoe appeared on his back haunch, his head snuggling into my palm. Glancing back at Ketchum, a human sized black cat purred next to him. The ruby eyes gazed lovingly into his, the female monster hissed to reveal vampire fangs. Smothering her in feverish kisses, the name Chat had her purring. Oiche trotted behind me, his snort shifting Amora’s attention to him. Spinning on her heels, her palms rubbed his snout. 

“What happened to your rider?” She asked sweetly, his head snuggling into her palm. “Protect my dear friend for me. I don’t want another repeat of today.” The words struggled to leave my lips, her smile faltering at my lack of words. 

“Thank you!” I blurted out awkwardly, the door opening into our cell block. “What you did back then saved my life from execution.” Burying into a bear hug, her warmth left nothing to be desired. Refusing to let me go, her chin rested on my shoulder. 

“He hurt children and I had to save the ones that were living. How could I not help our fellow assassin in that situation?” She assured me in a sisterly tone, her hands cupping my cheek. “People are in the wrong if they think that you deserve death for failing. Remember that I was the number one assassin for a while. That title came with intense pressure. Have fun and relax. I must get to creating bonds. These poor monsters merely needed a friend.” Charlox met her side, her raven cawing with excitement. Assassins buzzed with excitement on the other side, Amora helping her out to bond the correct monsters to the proper assassin. Watching her from a distance, Ketchum ran up to my side with his vampire cat. Seeing everyone smile for the first time in a while, hope shimmered in their eyes. Samara didn’t stand a freaking chance, my mind wondering what came next.

The homeless gentleman sat across from me, heating up his coffee and English muffin on the park’s fire pit. He seemed at ease in the elements- a black fur scarf wrapped lightly around his neck to break the chill wind of a winter morning. He had an eccentric, elegant style in the way his clothes wore his body. He exuded the aura of a man at home within himself.

I sipped my chai and listened to the stories of the elephants he’d seen in the lands he’d ventured into. He weaved the stories he’d lived as a gay gentleman in the 80’s, the hype of the hippie era, the AIDs epidemic, lovers, archeology, careers, and homes. His face moved with the rhythms of his memories.

I viscerally felt then the endless, ephemeral, fluid nature of the self and life- how we mark our existence in this wide, wild universe. A gazillion lives centering themselves in “time.”

We diverged paths by mid afternoon. I left warmed by him in the coldness of winter- there is wisdom weaved into living. What an honor to look into the archives of another soul. How intriguing every piece of a person’s past that leads them to the point in which our paths merge. I added him to the list of people I’d like to sit on a porch with in old age and share a kaleidoscope of experiences.

I wonder about the elephants we seek, and where we seek them from. I wonder what we do with the elephants we find. I wonder if we even know an elephant when we see an elephant. I wonder if there are elephants on other planets. I wonder how long a lifetime is. I wonder about the elephant in the room, and the elephants that haunt us.

1gb9p06,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1gb9p06/tourists_italo_train_experience/,Tourist’s Italo train experience ,"Before leaving for Italy I was concerned about the little nuances of taking the high speed train and I hope my experience helps someone. 

I booked tickets about 3-4 weeks before the trip and chose italo vs trenitalia solely based on best price available. Italo had a 2 for 1 deal which was very reasonably priced. I’d recommend not choosing the flexible ticket if you have a pretty good idea you will be taking the train at that time because it’s much cheaper. I also booked first class because apparently in the “smart” class you can’t take large luggage. Plus, would rather be more comfortable. 

The trains were easy to find at the stations (Rome termini, Firenze SM, Venezia SL) and although the website didn’t always list the track number, the stations are not so large that it’s hard to find. Plus, the train is at the station for 3-5 minutes so you don’t have to hop on it the second it arrives. 

First class has luggage racks above your seat and it fits checked baggage as long as you can lift it up. This was huge because I was concerned about our stupidly big bag we had to lug around and even got a lock to lock it to the rack if needed. The rack on the ground was full but overhead was plenty of space for everyone’s bags. There is also plenty of space at your feet for belongings like backpacks/purses. And plenty of leg room, a foot rest, reclining seat, and personal garbage can. 

 The WiFi wasn’t strong, you get a welcome cup of coffee or water/juice and a snack like cookies, and there’s no food available for purchase. The bathrooms are clean and plentiful. 

Basically everyone getting on the train had luggage and even in smart class people hard large suitcases but I can’t speak to where they kept them although it didn’t seem like anyone was getting turned away. 

Anyway, hope that helps someone! ",10,1729794566.0,ItalyTravel,8,0.92,False

I like to think I’m not an angry person. Tend to think the feelings before feeling em you know?
But holy shit did a customer try my patience today.

Bit of context, the store I’m at is one of the busier ones in the area, due to its close proximity to a couple of high schools/downtown area. We are also chronically short staffed, and very rarely have full coverage on the floor (due to a variety of reasons, but that’s a different story).

Now let me introduce Lady. 

Lady grabbed my attention when I was checking names on the end of the bar for a mobile order.

Lady: “My husband is at the auto store nearby, and has bought and charged and replaced our entire car battery!! :)”

Me: “???…Um, I’m glad he got it taken care of?”

Lady: “My son is next door and has gotten a complete hair cut!!”

Me: “Oh, are yo-“

Lady: “And in that time I have. still. not. gotten. my coffee! :D” 

Me (a little weirded out by how cheerful she is about this): “I’m sorry about that? We will have it out as soon as we can.”

Lady: “Haha it’s funny how often this happens. You guys  are such a chill store! 🙃”

I didn’t see Lady come in. I didn’t even know what her order was, and I have no clue how long she’s been waiting.
But I DO know that my coworker is soloing on the bar behind me, and is near running trying to get through the ungodly amount of mobiles coming through. I know that there’s a car in drive waiting impatiently by repeatedly asking “hello? Hello?? HELLO??!!” through the speaker. I know that warming is 15 tickets deep, and there two people waiting to order by the front register.

Chill. CHILL???!!! IS THIS LADY FUCKING BLIND???

I just turned and walked back to drive. I really didn’t how to respond in a way that wouldn’t get me fired.

I normally wouldn’t be so bothered by this. Just smile and nod, etc, all part of the job. 
But this isn’t the first time Lady has come by, regaling to anyone with the misfortune of making eye contact with her about all the things she got done while waiting for her coffee, because it took just THAT long.

Warning: long, but nothing scary.

I got a membrane sweep and check done at 41 weeks. I was about 3cm dilated that day. I woke up the next morning at 3am with contractions, mostly in my back. Back labour is not fun! They were holding steady at 5 mins apart but were pretty weak at that point, so I hung out at home for a while. Ate breakfast, showered, watched a movie. They got even closer together (3 mins apart) so I finally woke my husband and we went to the hospital around 7am.

Got checked in triage - still only 3cm. Sigh. We walked around the hospital for a couple hours, contractions still coming and feeling stronger. Still all in my back, but manageable. Checked again around 11-12ish - still only 3cm! My nurse said it must be prodromal labour and was going to send me home. My husband has just stepped out for coffee. I cried. I was so ready! Then the nurse comes back and was like nevermind, since you're 41+1 and GBS+ we are going to induce. Total whiplash.

Unfortunately, everyone seemed to be having a baby that day. Triage and L&D were slammed. We spent hours walking around the hospital and finally got sent up into L&D around midnight. I was still having back labour and counter pressure and deep breathing was no longer cutting it. I chatted with my husband and doula. Originally I was hoping to go drug-free but honestly I was already exhausted and STILL only 3cm. Since they were going to start me on pitocin, I felt overwhelmed and knew I wouldn't be able to do it without stronger pain management. What really sucked is most of the pain was in my tailbone, so sitting or lying down weren't really restful positions for me. I got some morphine which was lovely and then got an epidural while that was still working. I had been really afraid of the epidural but my anesthesiologist did it super quickly and I found it didn't really hurt.

Slept for a few hours. Water broke around 2:45am. There was meconium in the fluid and I had a fever. Got more antibiotics. Side lying was okay, but the hip/leg that was up would start to hurt badly with contractions since the epidural meds I guess flow down with gravity? Idk. Switching sides wasn't an option because baby's HR would go down a lot on the right side. I was in pain and fairly miserable. However I had progressed to 6cm! Mostly stayed in bed in different lying positions, tried hands and knees for a while which felt better but was also tiring. Threw up twice for no apparent reason. At one point (not sure about timing because I was in lala land) the doctors had mentioned that I might need assistance from vacuum or forceps, and that they would have to do that in the OR just in case. I was like what? We hadn't started pushing yet so I don't really understand why that was part of the conversation - maybe just because of baby's heart rate dips. But it ended up not mattering in the end. Soon I was 9.5cm! Started feeling some pressure and they did a check and were like ok you're dilated, let's talk about pushing.

I pushed for two hours. It was really really hard. Because of my terrible tailbone pain I could only really push in bed, and the nurses said my pushing was most effective in that position, but that also hurt badly because I was lying on my tailbone. I had great coaching from my husband and doula. To other FTMs, don't get discouraged if your first bit of pushing (or like, first hour and a bit) feels like nothing is happening. Eventually I was like oh this is what they mean by more pressure. My husband was like ""I can see hair"" and I was like WHAT! Kept going, basically crying between pushes but I could feel progress now. At one point the doctors were like ""ok the head is out, now just the body!"" One more push and it was done!! 39 hours of labour total 🙃

Husband cut the cord and generally looked shocked lol. Took him a minute to remember he was supposed to announce baby's sex. A girl! 8 lbs 12 oz and 50cm long. (and I'm only 5'2"" myself... how did she fit in there). We picked the name ""Mira"". 💜

In hospital for at least another 36-ish hours for monitoring but I did it! I could not have done it without my husband for sure, and having a doula was nice for extra support and reminding me that a lot of the things I was experiencing were completely normal.

When it comes to home design ca, it's essential to understand the elements that set California homes apart from those in other parts of the country. California homes often focus on the seamless integration of indoor and outdoor living spaces. This means patios, terraces, and large windows that allow natural light to flood into the home. The intention is to make nature a prominent feature of your living space, encouraging a calm, rejuvenating atmosphere.

Another distinct aspect of California design is the incorporation of earthy, natural materials. Think wood accents, stone flooring, and organic textiles. By using these materials, you can bring the essence of the state's landscape into your home. You may also notice that homes in California tend to lean towards more open floor plans. These open layouts facilitate easy movement between rooms, giving a greater sense of spaciousness and allowing families to come together more freely.

Furthermore, color palettes in California homes tend to be inspired by the environment—soft neutrals and shades reminiscent of the ocean, sky, and desert. However, don’t shy away from including bright colors if they speak to your style. California design is also about personalization, and vibrant, cheerful hues can bring warmth and character into your living spaces.

# Making the Most of Indoor-Outdoor Spaces

One of the most important features of California home design is the blending of indoor and outdoor areas. In a state blessed with favorable weather most of the year, utilizing your outdoor spaces is crucial. This can be achieved through open-plan living areas that lead straight out into a patio or deck area. Large sliding glass doors or folding doors can help you blur the lines between your indoor and outdoor spaces, creating an extended living area that’s perfect for relaxing or entertaining.

Think of adding an outdoor kitchen to take full advantage of the glorious California weather. Whether it’s a full-fledged outdoor kitchen with a grill, counters, and a fridge or a small nook with a barbecue setup and a seating area, the idea is to make the most of your exterior spaces. Fire pits and comfortable outdoor lounges also add a touch of coziness to your outdoor areas. With ample seating, shade, and some fairy lights, your outdoor space can be a haven for hosting friends or enjoying quiet evenings.

Another way to design the perfect indoor-outdoor connection is through natural landscaping. Californian landscaping is often drought-tolerant, which means plants like succulents, native grasses, lavender, and other low-water greenery are ideal choices. It helps you save on water bills while maintaining a lush, green environment right outside your windows.

# Interior Trends That Embrace California Living

The interior design of a California home is just as important as its exterior and outdoor spaces. One of the standout features of home design ca is creating a space that feels both comfortable and visually stimulating. Modern Californian interiors often incorporate a mix of modern and rustic elements. For instance, sleek, contemporary furniture pairs well with reclaimed wood or exposed brick, offering a balance between sophistication and a casual, lived-in feel.

Lighting also plays a critical role in creating the desired atmosphere. California homes tend to use a lot of natural light, so it’s a good idea to incorporate large windows and skylights wherever possible. Additionally, soft, warm-toned interior lighting adds to the cozy, welcoming environment in the evening hours. Think pendant lights over kitchen islands or warm wall sconces that create a pleasant ambiance.

Incorporating nature inside is another crucial aspect. Adding a collection of houseplants can provide that earthy feel synonymous with Californian living. Plants like the Fiddle Leaf Fig, Snake Plant, and succulents not only purify the air but also serve as beautiful, natural decor items.

# Creating Spaces That Are Uniquely You

The key to truly capturing the California aesthetic is personalization. While there are many common elements that characterize California homes, your home should reflect your individual taste. If you love surfing, for instance, you can include elements that speak to that—perhaps a surfboard displayed on the wall or beach-themed accents. If you’re more inclined towards a bohemian lifestyle, adding patterned throws, colorful textiles, and an eclectic mix of furniture can make your space come alive.

Flexibility and functionality are also essential elements to consider when designing your dream California home. Many homeowners are opting for multifunctional furniture and spaces that can adapt to different uses. For instance, a home office might double as a guest room, or a dining area could be reimagined as a workspace during the day. This level of flexibility is not only practical but helps your home grow and evolve with you.

Moreover, don’t forget the importance of sustainability in design. Incorporating eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient lighting, and water-saving appliances contributes to making your California home more in tune with nature and more cost-effective in the long run. This aligns well with the ethos of Californian living, which values environmental responsibility as much as style and comfort.

# Designing a Comfortable and Cozy California Bedroom

The bedroom should be your ultimate retreat—a space where you can escape from the stresses of the day and unwind. California bedrooms often embrace a neutral color scheme, which promotes relaxation and serenity. Soft shades of white, beige, and gray work well, but adding an accent color like ocean blue or soft green can also enhance the calming effect.

Choose natural, comfortable materials for bedding and decor. Linen or cotton bedding, plush throws, and textured pillows can create an inviting and snug environment. Large windows that allow for natural light during the day can make the room feel open and bright, while blackout curtains help ensure restful sleep at night.

Adding personal touches like family photographs, artwork that speaks to you, or keepsakes from travels is another great way to make your bedroom uniquely yours. And remember, simplicity is key—an uncluttered, well-organized room can make a significant difference in how relaxed you feel.

# Kitchens That Are the Heart of the Home

The kitchen in a California home is more than just a space for preparing meals; it's the heart of the home. Many California kitchen designs favor open layouts that flow into living or dining areas, encouraging interaction and making entertaining easy. A spacious island often serves as the central hub, providing a place for meal prep, dining, and socializing.

California kitchens also incorporate plenty of natural materials and textures. Wood, stone, and ceramic add warmth and interest, while open shelving is a popular trend that keeps the kitchen feeling light and airy. Open shelving also allows you to display beautiful dishes, glassware, or even small potted plants, adding personality to the space.

Functionality should also be top of mind when designing your kitchen. Quality appliances, ample storage, and durable materials are essential to creating a kitchen that is not only beautiful but also practical. Think about how you use your kitchen daily and ensure that the design makes those activities as efficient as possible.

# Bringing Warmth and Character to Your Living Room

The living room is where you and your guests are most likely to spend time, so it’s important to create a warm, welcoming atmosphere. California living rooms are often characterized by their bright and open nature. Large windows that offer stunning views or easy access to an outdoor area help connect the living room to the outdoors, making it feel expansive and refreshing.

Incorporating a mix of seating options, like a cozy sectional, a couple of armchairs, and some floor cushions, allows for versatility and comfort. A combination of different textures—like a soft rug, a woven blanket, and a leather sofa—can add depth and interest to the space. If you’re a fan of bohemian style, consider adding a rattan chair or some macrame wall hangings for an eclectic touch.

A statement piece like a large piece of artwork or a beautiful coffee table can also serve as a focal point for your living room. If you love the beach, perhaps a painting of the ocean could inspire the rest of the room's decor. Including elements of nature, like driftwood or seashells displayed in a tasteful way, can further bring a sense of the Californian landscape into your home.

# Bathrooms That Reflect Serenity

A California bathroom should feel like a spa—a place to relax and rejuvenate. Light, neutral tones work well in bathrooms, helping to create a sense of calm and cleanliness. Natural stone, wood accents, and large mirrors are popular features that help achieve this look.

For a luxurious touch, consider adding a freestanding bathtub. It's perfect for long, relaxing soaks and adds an element of elegance to your bathroom. If space permits, a spacious walk-in shower with glass doors and high-quality fixtures can elevate the room's aesthetic.

Plants are a lovely addition to any bathroom, as they not only improve air quality but also add a fresh, organic element. Choose low-maintenance plants that thrive in humidity, like ferns or peace lilies, to enhance the spa-like atmosphere.

# Final Thoughts on Designing Your California Dream Home

Designing a California home means blending indoor and outdoor living, using natural materials, and creating spaces that are as beautiful as they are functional. It’s about capturing the relaxed, sun-drenched lifestyle that makes living in California so special. From open, airy kitchens to cozy, serene bedrooms, each room should reflect your personal style while embracing the essence of California living.

By integrating elements that speak to your personality, focusing on comfort, and making use of California’s natural beauty, you can create a space that feels uniquely yours. The journey to designing your dream home is a personal and creative one, and there’s no right or wrong way to go about it. It’s all about what makes you feel at home and brings you joy. So take inspiration from the ideas above, and make your California home a true reflection of yourself.",1,1729794345.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False
1gb9l9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AthensHousing/comments/1gb9l9y/2_br25_ba_2nd_floor_sublease_takeover_at_the_mill/,2 BR/2.5 BA 2nd floor sublease / takeover at The Mill District - $2010/mo,"Hello! My girlfriend and I would like to offer our 2 BR second-floor apartment at the newly-built Mill District, off of Barber Street & Tracy St (behind Buvez), for sublease and takeover.

That is to say: our lease runs out at the end of July 2025, and you would be subleasing until then. If you would like to stay, you would begin your own lease thereafter. **Note**: We cannot guarantee that this option would be available to you, as College Town Properties have already collected their renewal commitments this past September. If you would like to sublease this unit, we encourage you to do that ASAP and to lock down a renewal with College Town before they market the apartment to others for the 2025-26 academic year.

We are pretty flexible about when to begin the sublease; I suppose our preferred answer is ASAP, but we understand that most interest tends to fall on semester boundaries. However, if you have a need to move fast, we could start as early as November. While there is a not-insubstantial subleasing fee ($250 at last check), we will pay it! You will, of course, need to qualify with College Town Properties independently in every other respect, pay any fees (e.g. pet deposits, security deposits) and the rest of it.

The Mill District is both walking distance to downtown, UGA, Normaltown nightlife, the hospital, the Dudley Park and the Firefly, etc. Vitally, it's also new construction, which is a rare find in the Normaltown/New Town area. That means the place has been blissfully problem-free, and will continue to be for some time. No pests, no rot, no mold, everything works (as far as we know!); that's not the typical housing situation in this part of town, and it's a godsend for busy people who just want low-maintenance, low-stress convenience, not to deal with house problems. There is also ample on-site parking, solving another perennial challenge of living on the more settled streets of this area.

By far our favourite thing about this place has been the large, tall picture windows, and the amount of natural light the place admits. It lends a cheerful, optimistic mood to every day, gives one a sunny perch from which to observe the lively goings-on at the kiosks outside, but without blinding sunlight or excessive heat.

It's quite conveniently located, whether you're a Townie or in school, and is a nice, central location from which to conduct one's life in either direction of Prince. It is, of course, especially convenient for students; the logic of the layout lends itself well to splitting the two bedrooms, each having their own full bathroom, and a long hallway to separate them. A nice bonus are the small kiosk businesses located in the middle of the estate, including Sunroof Coffee and Dawg Day Frosé, among others. You're also a \~1-minute walk from Hidden Gem and Nighthawks, two of the best new additions to Athens nightlife; Nighthawks is actually part of the estate, and Hidden Gem is just across a lot.

Another benefit of subleasing from us is that our locked-in rental rate of $2,010/mo will apply to you. Because of their attractive location, 2 BR units for fresh move-ins for 2025 are on offer at $2,700/mo at the time of this writing.

I've included a selection of our own photos, but will direct you to the Zillow listing by College Town Properties as well:

While other cooking was easy to adjust to, the switch from a traditional aluminum Bialetti to the Musa has been highly disappointing.

I've tried everything recommended on various forums, including starting with hot or cold water, different power levels, grind size, etc. but the coffee made by the Musa just doesn't live up to the excellent quality of the original aluminum Moka Express on a gas hob.

At one point I suspected the different heating profile (gas heats the entire bottom reservoir while induction heats only the bottom plate), but this is disproved by the fact that the Moka Express on an electric hotplate (during the remodel), was just as good as on gas.

I measured the capacity of the coffee holder with a digital caliper (numbers below) and found that both the Musa and original Moka Express have almost the same volume (Moka Express 131.66cc vs Musa 130.69cc) differing by only 1%.  However, the water volume was 430ml (Moka Express) vs 500ml (Musa).  So there's about 16% less coffee:water ratio with the Musa.

Questions:

* Does the problem just boil down (pun intended) to the water:coffee ratio?
* Does the Bialetti Venus hold more coffee to improve the ratio?

First post here! My partner and I are looking at short-term rentals of the first floor unit of our two-flat, considering long-term vs. short-term rental. This forum has been incredibly helpful! (Thank you all!) I've got some questions I haven't seen answered elsewhere, one of which is: what was a substantial up-front expense you didn't plan for, or wish you had made before renting? (Further details on our situation are at the end, in the spirit of tl/dr). I know the obvious ones for us:

\- Furniture, repainting, artwork, bedding, towels, kitchen supplies, etc., etc.

\- New smart locks, smart thermostat (right now we have regular keys and an old-school dial thermostat)

What caught you by surprise, or made you wish you had done it at the start? It might be worth noting that we look at this as a medium-term proposition - unexpected but non-permanent financial issues arose - and in an ideal world would be doing this for two or three years only. So before we decide we really want to have a very serious budget fixed.

With thanks in advance,

Jeff

Background: this would be the first-floor unit of a 1920s Chicago two-flat. Though the building remains two separate units we've always just treated it as ""a house that happens to have two kitchens."" It's on a quiet side street in a desirable neighborhood, walking distance to shopping, restaurants, nightlife (potential plus \*and\* minus!) and the Blue Line L that goes directly to O'Hare and downtown. It's 2BR/1 bath, with all the original oak woodwork, built-in bookcases, etc. Will photograph well! Nice little back porch for morning coffee. Drawbacks: no off-street parking, though it's a non-permit block and except for Sunday mornings (big church on the corner) spaces are easy to find. No washer/dryer in the unit (the logistics of installing them, or providing access to ours in the basement, are too difficult.) Very small bedrooms by modern standards (nobody had a king-size bed in 1923!) We're also considering long-term rental, fwiw. The various posts about that in this forum have been particularly good reality checks. ",0,1729794230.0,airbnb_hosts,3,0.5,False
1gb9k76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/1gb9k76/i_never_needed_meds/,I never needed meds.,"I went to a psychiatrist after COVID. I was in university, and struggling with online courses. I was always either delusional and depressed about what I could do and achieve, and I needed help. He diagnosed me immediately with bipolar in the first appointment, and had me go through a mix of antipsychotics and antidepressants. 

I went from 180lbs to 240lbs, and I became far more dysfunctional and moody, more anxious and manic, and I was more suicidal when I miss my meds because I become sober to what I became. They chemically mutilated and scarred my body forever (I never had loose skin or stretch marks), and made me so anxious during most of my 20s, I stayed shut in most of the time because I suffered so much in public. 

Eventually, after I turned 25 in my country, you can no longer qualify for psych medication with public healthcare, and I thought it was the end for me. I spent most of the last bit of my money on therapy as a last ditch effort, and they never focused on helping me with figuring out what I needed to at the time (finding a job), so much as indulging in their own theories of what is right. Eventually I ran out of money for it. I also started taking adderall just because I wanted to avoid being depressed, because I thought I was going to kill myself if I ever did, but I ran out of that as well.

I stayed with my parents, then and I just tried to ride it out. Somehow, I ended up far more functional than before or during my usage of meds. I started taking 0.5mg of melatonin to sleep, I stopped taking caffeine after noon, I started exercising in the morning. I lost most of the weight (240lbs -> 160lbs ) by counting calories and spacing out meals instead of trying to all-or-nothing fast. I wake up early, I can talk to strangers and go out with other people and feel like I'm not about to die. I'm far more productive and thoughtful.  Everything just made sense suddenly. Except I'm not at peace.

I realized that my entire struggle was simply because my parents didn't feel the need to tell me common sense. That since I was 12, drinking a cup of coffee or coke during the evening was not a good idea. Or that a lack of sleep will lead to a lot of depression, anxiety, mania, and weight issues, and that exercise is fundamental not optional. That melatonin is useful because it thwarts a lot of the things we experience in the modern day, like artificial lighting and social media engagement. 

I don't blame or hate my parents, because they're from a different culture and time, and I don't hate that I suffered because I learned a lot of things through it (journaling/introspection, using writing as a coping mechanism, interest in philosophy etc.). I hate that nobody helped me in such a simple way when I needed it. They affected me so much, and I trusted them so much, but to them I'll always be another client. You can't even criticize them publicly because ""it must be personal"".  

I hate that as a dysfunctional person, you can only ever get ""helped"" by being labelled mentally ill or disabled, and thus suffer your loss of personhood and be more easily exploited through a system that doesn't help you at all.

All this because I was looking for an outlet for my anger, pain, no one could understand me, I had friends but looking back I dont really think they were friends just cell mates in the prison of sin.

All this because I thought only people who are nice go to church, but when I got courage to go to church I found out this people were not as 'holy' as I thought so I would take comfort in that and continue in my brokeness looking for alternatives.

Until one day I just got tired I couldnt drink anymore alcohol, smoking didnt even make me high just tired, sex also felt boring... I felt there was something more I needed I cant explain it but the hole in me was existential nothing could fill it, I tried studying r3ligions but still nothing.

This was until one girl I had met in a work event and she told she was going to a Pastor T concert in Meru at my former high school and because she was pretty I thought why not.

As we reached the venue I thought why not listen to the event pastor T anikemee turudi na mrembo tuende coffee. But it was not matters as usual.

The meeting was doneìn the field of the said school and as we neared I noticed the event was full of young people who were very well dressed I remember thinking I should have come alone ju conquest ni mob ma peng kwa wingi but decided ku push that thought down.

Anyway tukaingia the tent, It was a large white tent the type with steel beams and curtains, alafu screens kila place, speakers usiseme some of the best speakers nimewai ona and I remember telling my company that organising such an event, logistics, accomodation, tent must be like a cool 5 mill, i digress

Lakini I remember kuna dem aliingia na wimbo hapo (by the way worship team ya truth mentorship na life church si jokes) i remember not caring anymore what anyone thought tukaimba hapo, then T akaingia na message alikuwa ni kama ameniandikia, wueeh by the time worship ya kufunga inaanza I was on my knees nimelia mbaya I couldnot believe this God who would still love me no matter how I was.

Niliomba hapo on my knees not caring about anything huku machozi yabubujika there was a great conviction in my heart, i knew that was my time for salvation.
I remember after words feeling like a heavy weight was lifted from me, I did not care about my date after the event anymore I just wanted to hear about this God.

Unfortunately, yesterday when I slid it out the base became loose and then the filter release didn't align properly, spilling coffee and grounds everywhere.  
  
Anyone have an elegant solution to make sliding this back and forth easier? An appliance slider that fits the 79317?",1,1729793993.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

Mainly because I noticed that usually he talks to alot of girls or girls look for him . Anyways he later began calling my attention and I started greeting him and saying  hi.  Later it ended up with me asking him if he would help me lift and he said yes. Yes he has flirted with me , he has said I am pretty , he also said I have a nice smile. The signs are clear but then again since he talks to alot of girls I don't take him that seriously .

A Thursday I saw him in the stairs flirting with a girl . He didn't see me but we'll it crushed me a bit , I cried .  He texted me on the weekend and through the week I just felt off. He talked with the girl again and other girls for that matter.


Yesterday he invited me out for a coffee and idk. Through text he is one guy but then at the gym he does at some point surround himself around girls. 

I asked around and guys usually just said "" guys will talk to multiple women to see who eventually agrees and it's normal "" I've been off the dating scene for years tbh .

Is this true ? Would you go out with someone like that? I can see it as insignificant as a date or something that might turn seriously.  How is the dating scene now ? Tbh the dating market is awful ",3,1729793955.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,13,0.81,False

The thing is, she didn’t say anything until I asked about it.and also That morning.(The thing is, she didn’t text me beforehand to let me know she couldn’t make it.) she acted as usual, and my friend even mentioned that she seemed dressed up, almost like she was preparing for the date. However, when I asked later, she said she had work to do.Despite canceling, she still treats me the same as before she doesn’t ignore me. My friend thinks she might have a crush on me based on her behavior. Is it normal  ask 1st time to go out? Why  she said no? What should I do?",0,1729793898.0,srilanka,7,0.5,False

Looking for: Kausap from 1am-2am MNL time. Someone who has a lot of interesting topics to share. Someone whom O can exchange ideas with about anything really.

No gender preference basta interesting kang kausap, g.
Dito lang sa reddit, no to TG or whatsoever apps. I like keeping things anon.

After workshift ko kasi yan, need ko lang ng kausap just to rant. Alam mo yun - to rant. 

No sexting haha 
Sakto lang green jokes pero wag naman puro ganun yung topic haha

Now I'm pleased about having another brewer, but the problem is, I have no clue how to use it!

I've used a Clever Dripper for the last 2+ years so should I treat that as a frame of reference for the Switch? Is the grind size needed the same or do I need to go coarser or finer? I've read about the hybrid method but don't have a gooseneck kettle for the open switch part and the capacity isn't big enough for a full immersion brew.

I was just sick last week so I assumed that’s prob one of the reasons why but I feel a bit better now. I did have unprotected s*x the past month, but we did end up using a condom. It’s also has been quite an eventful month with lots and lots of drinking. I had also drank a lot of caffeine from coffee which also affected my body physically and mentally. At this point i’m not sure which of these many reasons is the cause of my period being late.. I’m also terrified to buy a test..

I haven’t been feeling much cramping, I haven’t had any discharge, but recently my backs been hurting. I’m trying not to stress too much about it, but it’s hard. Wondering if anyone has any similar experience with no symptoms? ",1,1729793521.0,Periods,2,0.67,False
