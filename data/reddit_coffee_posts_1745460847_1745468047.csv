My family has been growing natural process Arabica for years at elevations between 1,700 and 2,200 meters. We use traditional sun-drying methods and can trace everything from the cherry to the final bag.

We‚Äôve mostly focused on farming and selling locally, but I‚Äôm trying to learn more about coffee exporting and how we can eventually connect directly with ethical buyers abroad. I don‚Äôt have any export experience yet, but I‚Äôm eager to understand the process and how to present our coffee professionally.

Some key info about our farm:

Harvest season: November to February

Soil and climate: Volcanic soil, subtropical weather

Production: Smallholder scale (around 0.5‚Äì5 tons/year depending on the season)

Certification: None for now, but we follow traditional and careful processing methods


I‚Äôd love advice on the following:

1. For roasters: What documentation or details matter most when you‚Äôre evaluating naturals from Ethiopia? (e.g., soil tests, processing records)


2. For importers: How can a smallholder or new exporter show quality without formal cupping reports or certifications?


3. For anyone: What resources would you recommend to help us describe flavors better? We usually notice stone fruit and floral notes.",1,1745467533.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

1k6j4fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1k6j4fz/bullying_by_a_neighbour_company/,Bullying by a neighbour company,"Writing this for a friend that doesn't have a Reddit account:
I have a small business in a rental building. We share our floor with two other small businesses . We also share common spaces the conference room and the front desk. All the companies on this floor work mostly with children and families as clients

 I think one of the other businesses want us out. They are constantly bothering my clients, my employees and I'm starting to believe they are sabotaging us.

Now there are 6 incidents that make me think so : 

Number 1: the front desk drama:
We share the waiting room/front desk area. They have a receptionist and we don't. Sometimes when our clients arrive for an appointment, they approach their receptionist. Instead of just telling them to go to the next office to join us, their receptionist mistreats our clients, don't talk to our clients or goes to our office and tell my employees (in a really rude manner) to stop sending their clients to her desk.
I talk to her boss, nothing happened.

Number 2: The wifi delay:
The internet service comes with the rental deal, so we also share the same internet contract. For some reason we spend a whole week with no Wifi, just is on our office, not in theirs. In order to solve the situation, I needed the account number of the contract and locate the router. So I went to the neighbour business to ask them about this info. Their Director (let's call her Karen) told me they didn't know it. But I know they do, cause they've been in this building longer than us. I ask her if she could at least turn off/on the router to see if that would solve the problem. She said no. Eventually, the internet company came one week after and solved the problem in 2 minutes.

Number 3: the conference room:
This one is short. Karen booked the conference room for the next five years so nobody else can use it. 

Number 4: the selfish child:
In our shared waiting room, they put some of their furniture and a box with toys. This area has been fournished by all the companies on the floor (we put a table and chairs, they put a couch,etc). Sometimes our clients sit there and their children play with the toys. The receptionist approach our client and told her that she couldn't sit there (the couch that was bought by them) or play with those toys, cause they were not clients of their company. We're talking about a mom and her 4yo. Of course the mother was pissed and never came back. 

Number 5: the plumber distrust.
We had a huge problem with our pipe system. Sewage from the toilet was literally coming from the kitchen sink. We call the plumber urgently. He told us that to repair the pipes, we needed to leave the office immediately but make sure that somebody will open the door when they arrive. I ask Karen if one of her employees could open the door for the plumbers while we were not there. She said no. I told her, ""well then, I'll give them the keys of the building"". She said she wouldn't feel safe if I do that. 

Number 6: the insects nightmare:

This is when I start to fall into madness.
Yesterday we found in our dining area (it's separate from their office, but they have access through the kitchen) a big can of ground coffee that was full of insects (these ones that look like cockroaches but smaller) it was up in one of the kitchen counters. For some reason, I'm convinced they put it there. (I'm getting paranoiac at this point, it's just weird that we found this now).

---------------
What do you guys think? What should I do? I don't know resources to solve this situation.

---------------
For more context, both companies work with families and children. But we offer different services.
I'm not scared of losing clients because most of them are referred by private and public system, but this situation is definitely affecting our life in office.

**Who Is Joe Navarro and Why Should You Care?**  
Let‚Äôs start with the big ‚ÄúWho.‚Äù Joe Navarro isn‚Äôt just another body language coach ‚Äì this guy spent 25 years with the FBI, reading people for a living. If anyone knows how to decode a subtle twitch or a hesitant shuffle, it‚Äôs him. The *Joe Navarro - Online Advanced Speed Reading People Course* is his brainchild ‚Äì a course crafted with all the real-world experience and insights you‚Äôd expect from someone who‚Äôs written *What Every BODY Is Saying* and helped crack countless cases using nonverbal cues.

**What‚Äôs This Course All About Anyway?**  
So what are you getting into? This course is like having Joe Navarro personally teach you the art and science of reading people. You‚Äôll dive deep into 10 progressive modules, starting from the basics of nonverbal communication and moving into nuanced stuff like facial cues, postures, and even the nonverbals of dating (yep, he goes there). Each module builds on the last, and you‚Äôve gotta pass one to move on ‚Äì meaning you‚Äôre not just watching videos, you‚Äôre actually learning. The *Joe Navarro - Online Advanced Speed Reading People Course* isn‚Äôt a binge-watch; it‚Äôs a full-on transformation of how you understand people.

**Where and When Can You Learn?**  
Here‚Äôs the best part ‚Äì it‚Äôs totally online, self-paced, and done from anywhere you like. Couch? Coffee shop? Sitting at the DMV? It‚Äôs all fair game. Most folks finish in 8‚Äì12 months, but you can blaze through or take your sweet time. Learning under Joe‚Äôs guidance feels personal even though you‚Äôre technically solo. His techniques and tools are the same ones used by the FBI, which is pretty insane when you think about it.

**Why This Course Might Just Be Your Superpower**  
Let‚Äôs get into the ‚ÄúWhy.‚Äù Being able to decode people‚Äôs real thoughts, feelings, and intentions? That‚Äôs gold. Whether you‚Äôre in business, dating, leadership, or just want to level up your people skills, this course arms you with tools to see beneath the surface. You‚Äôll figure out which nonverbals actually matter (spoiler: not all do), how to spot lies without being Sherlock, and how to be a more trustworthy and empathetic communicator yourself. It‚Äôs like putting on x-ray glasses for human behavior.

**How Does It Work ‚Äì and Is It Legit?**  
The structure is clear: you work through the 10 modules, starting with the foundation and moving into advanced interpretation. It‚Äôs interactive too ‚Äì you‚Äôll apply what you learn, not just watch it. And don‚Äôt worry, this isn‚Äôt pseudoscience. Joe bases everything on neuroscience, behavioral psychology, and cold, hard experience. From reading feet (yes, seriously) to decoding leadership signals, it‚Äôs all backed up and applicable.

**Final Thoughts ‚Äì Worth It? Heck Yes.**  
If you‚Äôve ever wanted to walk into a room and instantly get a read on everyone, the *Joe Navarro - Online Advanced Speed Reading People Course* is the real deal. It‚Äôs not fluff, it‚Äôs field-tested training from one of the best in the business. Whether you're into self-development, improving professional influence, or just curious about what people are really saying with their bodies, this course delivers.

Bottom line: This is like upgrading your brain‚Äôs people-reading software with elite FBI-level firmware.",1,1745466992.0,ZarekStudying,1,1.0,False

* Who would you want to be matched with each week?

‚ÄúWhat the heck!?‚Äù

His voice sliced through the room like a whip.

I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who‚Äôd just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve worked for me for two years,‚Äù he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. ‚ÄúAnd you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.‚Äù

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mr. Steele‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry doesn‚Äôt clean Armani.‚Äù He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. ‚ÄúAnd what the¬†*hell*¬†are you wearing?‚Äù

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I‚Äôd owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not running a charity,‚Äù Luca said, cutting through the silence. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt show up looking like a professional, then don‚Äôt show up at all.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn‚Äôt just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn‚Äôt even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so‚Ä¶¬†*tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig‚Äîit sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then‚Äîmy phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

‚Äú*She looks like a blind clown.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI heard she lives in her car*.‚Äù

‚Äú*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.‚Äù*

I didn‚Äôt flinch. I didn‚Äôt break stride. I never did.

Luca‚Äôs office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn‚Äôt look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him‚Äîmonochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth‚Äîheat. Intensity.

Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes‚Äîice-colored and emotionless.They‚Äôd never softened. Not once.

I handed him the corrected reports in silence.

He barely acknowledged me.

‚ÄúGet me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It‚Äôs sloppy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mr. Steele.‚Äù

I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen.¬†*Unknown Number.*

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I whispered.

A soft voice crackled on the line. ‚ÄúHi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a man here to see you.‚Äù

My stomach tightened. ‚ÄúA man?‚Äù I said, confused. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

She hesitated. ‚ÄúHe gave his name. Said you‚Äôd recognize it.‚Äù

I waited.

Dentist did x-rays aswell as took a look around in my teeth. Two people looked at my x-rays and reported no decay or recession. However I can't help but think otherwise.

The teeth I've circled are the ones I'm most convinced of having decay. In the first image there is a small hole with a brown dot in the center in the front tooth and the one behind just had a really darker spot.

1k6iszr,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1k6iszr/refinding_myself_after_over_15_years_of/,Re-finding myself after over 15 years of narcisstic abuse,"For few years, I felt like I had lost myself. Completely. I had started to absorb the information, I noticed myself acting in patterns of behavior that do not belong to myself and the guilt and sense of self-betrayal was eating me from the inside out. I was feeling hollowed, and empty, until I saw the black, dense string that was buried at one of the deepest corners of my heart. The darkness that dwelled there, the empty, hollow tunnel that lead to it's source. I followed it down like Alice through the rabbit hole, only to find my way, after so much illusion, pain and suffering, to it's point of origin. Over sixteen years of events, trauma, internalized false sense of identity, patterns and thoughts, emotional blockages begun to unravel, and I begun not only to recover my sense of self, even though I fell, stumbled, I got back up again, evolved, and last weekend was the culmination of those events.

I originally RSVP'd no to the party, I did not want to see the person at all, I thought distance would send a message, that explanation that my boundaries are not respected in the company served a notice that would be clear, precise, calm and closure for myself. But I decided no, I will not let the man tyrannize my life or prevent me from seeing the people I care about. So I went. I think we both already knew in silence that the game was up, I tried to start few polite conversations during the night, but was responded with silent treatment. I was feeling proud of myself from remaining grounded, detached, and indifferent to his treatment. When I left the party, and just as I was out the door, he ran after me, and said the first three words during the entire night ""I love you."" I could feel his presence attempting to contain my body, envelop me through and through, but my presence rejected him entirely. I looked him dead in the eye, and let out a low toned ""Mhm."" And walked away. I was feeling euphoric before I was leaving, and the ecstasy, the self-love, my whole self, I felt it returning to me, like everything I had lost, every bit of self-love sacrificed, every bit of me abandoned, begun pouring back to me. This next bit I am not particularly proud of, but I could feel his evil eye on my back, that same condescending hollow blackness of void that demanded I need him, his validation or approval for my breath. So I had enough, I took the dagger into my hand, and stabbed him through text message. ""Love bombing does not help. I do not love you. I was stupefied by the attempt. Then again, typical behavior for a narcissist. I am not the mirror of your ego, and my life is not yours. It's time you let go of my tit"" He had an outrage after from what I heard. Now, I guilt tripped myself for being cruel, out of the euphoria and ecstasy, but I promised myself that was the last time I let that man interfere with my inner world, and after so many years of having myself back for just fleeting moments at the time, that what I did was self-protection, a way of asserting that even after saying that good bye, there will not a next, that my life is now reclaimed, and all mine, and I will not let anyone treat me in the same way, ever again. So maybe, for fifteen years, a bit of a mental slap in the face, that I wish I had said right to his face, was a forgivable social conduct for myself, at least my rejection now was left no room for intreptation for.

I felt that same ecstasy and euphoria in glimpses these past few days. Self-love being all mine, and not something that can be robbed from me anymore. My own voice behind the mask that has been forced on my face, mirror reflection of his image of me which I desperately fought against which wasn't mine for over fifteen years. I also this past month have had my heart receptive to receiving love, to allowing love, genuine real love that wasn't just mirrored bread crumbs of my self-love to be received back to me after it was stolen from me, and I loved in return, and I cannot believe the joy it brings me to begin to remember what that actually felt like! Think it was in those moments that made the changes I felt like I was mentally pushing myself for, to solidify and regain ground in me enough to steel myself for reclamation. Now, while I am still unhealed, still regathering some of the broken pieces of me, I feel free, even if sometimes my mind falls back into the shadows, my heart locks up for a moment, I am reminded that he no longer has no access to me, that it is naught but echoes of the past that still linger, and as I had a cigarette in the cold light of the first dawn of the morning, I know Summer is coming.  


Getting here wasn't easy. I must admit trying to desperately figure it all out, as I felt like time was running out on windows of opportunity I may not recover, I pointed fingers in the wrong direction at any signs of someone being that person because they reflected in the hollowed space in me created by him as if they were occupants and conspirators in the same space, acted reactionary abuse towards those who did not deserve it, acted irritable, rash, lost too much playing a sick game of cluedo with fifteen different narratives without knowing which one is the actual reality and who the fuck is the real Butler. But I can no longer unsee the illusion, the fragmented memories regained left no room for intreptation, no doubt, nothing but clear vision in the cold light of truth in catching the killer of me. I am comfortable in admitting the blindfold had been on my eyes for too long, should I ever meet those I wronged in attempting to undo my own wrongs and apologize. Forgiveness, healing, recuperation, rest and restoration. I feel in the longest time, a sense of peace, no a whole day of mindfogginess, and I know my self, my evolved self, is waiting just behind the temporary moments where my mind feels like it's being pulled back to spiraling the past and losing itself in a river of fog, the healing to remain present in the now that lets me heal the rest by living and thriving, not surviving. But I am here, I am not going anywhere, and I am free. It can be done, the cognitive dissonance recognized, the patterns seen with naked eye, and admitting to yourself you cannot fix the person, that they will not change, they refuse to heal, they refuse to grow, and you are trying to fill an endless pit that cannot be fulfilled and that you can leave, you can detach, you can free yourself, and abandon them not out of cruelty or hatred or revenge, but for self-protection, and recollecting your own life, for your own right to live and freeing yourself of the any resemblance of being the reflected image, adjancent of them. Now my sense of completion, my fulfillment, is finally completely independent of anyone else. I can feel it right there, behind the occasional moments of self-blame, guilt, pain and ghosts of the past releasing to become the morning dew for the new me. Took a lot to admit to myself, that a person so close to me was the reason one thirds of my life went missing, ruined my inner paradise and turned it into a desert, running a gauntlet of survival and I let it happen to myself. But here I still am, I did not just survive, I evolved in harsh conditions that without, I would not be the me I am today. At least, it's a comforting, self-empowering story to tell myself.   
  
I can admit I wrote this mostly for myself, so I can read it through a week later with a smile on my face before I press delete thread, but also if within that week even one person feels like that hey, if a stranger on the internet could do it, and apparently a ton of fuck ups while doing it are allowed without needing to give up, I can do it too! All the better, well, that would just make my week.

Now I'll have a cup of, excuse me, a damn fine coffee.

1k6isvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1k6isvv/people_started_treating_me_differently_sooner/,People started treating me differently sooner than I thought,"I knew from reading enough testimonials of people who had lost weight, especially women, that people were going to treat me differently if I ever lost a significant amount of weight. But do be honest, I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

For reference, I'm coming up on being 80 pounds down since I started Zepbound on January 4, but my starting weight was 319--so I still have a long way to go before I reach what I consider a ""healthy"" weight. I know I look different, but it's hard for me to really tell, and...I'm still over 240 pounds, so I'm certainly not even close to what I would consider having ""skinny privilege.""

That being said, this past week, a couple of women in my office stopped me on my way to the bathroom and commented on how I'd lost weight, which to be honest I found a little unprofessional, and they immediately asked me if I was on the shot. I'm pretty private about this and I haven't told anyone outside of my immediate family, so I just avoided the question--but it felt like overstepping for them to ask in the first place. To be honest, I've hardly ever spoken to either one of these women. And one of them said, ""Well, regardless, you look amazing, it took like ten years off of your face.""

I'm in my 20s, so I didn't really take this as the compliment that I think she intended it. And the only thing it really made me realize was that even when you do lose weight, the face that you've been obese makes people feel strangely entitled to comment on anything that comes to mind about your body--even in a professional environment.

And beyond that incident with my coworkers, I've noticed that men have already started treating me differently. I've always been a bigger girl, so I've taken being ignored by men as the norm. And while I knew I'd get more attention if I lost weight, I thought that would happen when I was much, much further along. Now, I've noticed that random men will just start conversations with me in public. Waiting for the elevator, in line for coffee, or when I'm out with my dog. I've also noticed men holding doors for me most of the time, where before it was 50/50.

It's not that I mind any of that, none of it is inherently bad--but it makes me much more bothered about the way I was being treated before. And I've gotten so used to being ignored--I gained most of my weight during puberty after the onset of PCOS--I feel awkward when I do get that attention.

This medicine has done so many good things for my life, and I'm so grateful--this is just one change I wasn't expecting, and not so soon.",5,1745466220.0,Zepbound,3,1.0,False

1k6iqzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThreadTalkPodcast/comments/1k6iqzh/aita_for_not_feeling_empathy_anymore_for_my/,AITA for not feeling empathy anymore for my boyfriend while he‚Äôs been struggling?,"Hi. I (28 F) having been dating my boyfriend (29 M) for 2 years. We‚Äôve been living together for 1 year. 

When he initially moved in we both were working full time and everything was great. I was very attracted to his ambition and how far he had come since we started dating (he moved up in his career and achieved a lot of personal goals). About a month or 2 into us living together he got laid off. He was pretty depressed understandably when this happened. He was on EI so it wasn‚Äôt a huge impact in our bills as I already make a lot more than him. I was empathetic and patient for the first couple months. I even enjoyed having him make me coffee in the morning and making my lunches and dinners. He was great! But then.. he didn‚Äôt work for NINE MONTHS. I didn‚Äôt have any space to have alone time ever. He was home 24/7. I love spending time with him but like sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have an hour or 2 to yourself in your home. Idk maybe it‚Äôs just me? 

I started to get really really sick of him not working around 6 months. The charm of him making me coffee and cooking wore off and I would just come home every day annoyed. When I would get home the house wouldn‚Äôt be clean, the dogs hadn‚Äôt been out for a walk at all and he‚Äôs on his computer gaming. Now here‚Äôs what annoyed me about all this. I work long hours in the healthcare industry, up to 14hrs per day at times. When I get home I am so exhausted I can barely stay upright. If he was also working full time I would‚Äôve had no problem splitting up chores and cooking so that it wasn‚Äôt even based on our work schedules. I did realize it was unfair to be annoyed with him because I never talked to him about my expectations or what would really help me out since he‚Äôs home. So I sat down with him and told him he needs to work on getting a job because I haven‚Äôt seen him put effort into it and it wasn‚Äôt like I wasn‚Äôt patient. He got kind of defensive about it which was frustrating because I told him I would help him look for jobs if he wanted. He only started taking this seriously when my mom told me she was worried about me because he was a deadbeat. I told him that she said that. Maybe that was wrong of me but he literally didn‚Äôt listen to a word I said and seemed to just game all day and do nothing that benefits or improves his life. He snapped into action and fixed up his resume and applied to jobs for hours daily. Now the second issue was the cleaning and cooking. I sat him down and said I expected him to keep the house reasonably clean and do a lot of the cooking and walk the dogs even for 10mins IF he was going to just stay at home all day. It didn‚Äôt feel fair that I had to work my ass off and he just got to do whatever he wanted. He agreed and I was so happy with that! Then I‚Äôd come home day after day to coffee still spilled on the counter from him making his own coffee that morning or the kitchen absolutely full of dirty dishes or dog pee that looked like it had been there for a couple hours‚Ä¶. I was so frustrated. I talked to him and I was honest with him and told him I was starting to resent him because he gets to stay home and I don‚Äôt. If I was home I would love to organize and clean the house, spend time with the dogs outdoors for hours and make new and fun foods but I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm working so much. 

Anyways things didn‚Äôt change all that much and I ended up emailing him jobs that I would find. The FIRST job I sent him he applied to and got. I was like what the hell have you been doing all this time?? It took me a minute to find this job and I found 10+ more jobs just like it. I thought I would start to feel close to him again and more affectionate now that he has a job but I don‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel resentful when I‚Äôm cleaning but there are certain things that just make me go ‚Äúreally?‚Äù. For example I‚Äôll come home at like 9:30pm from work and the coffee is still in the pot from his morning coffee and there‚Äôs dishes all over the counter but the dishwasher is empty? Why aren‚Äôt the dishes in the dishwasher? I‚Äôm not his mother I shouldn‚Äôt have to teach him basic life skills for cleanliness. He said he would still do the cooking and I agreed to do basically all the cleaning but he doesn‚Äôt even cook‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll make just pasta or order food from fast food places. He knows I‚Äôm trying to eat healthy as I have some autoimmune issues and all the processed, fatty and sugary foods really flare up my inflammation and cause me more exhaustion and pain. Now I know I could just make my own food but WAIT- I‚Äôve tried. If I try to just make a protein shake because he made something with only carbs and fat or wants to order fast food he gets offended? He acts like it‚Äôs me telling him he‚Äôs not good enough which is frustrating because I very politely decline fast food or any food that causes me pain! I think that‚Äôs fair! 

He opened up to me recently when I kind of lost my cool at him and told me he‚Äôs been experiencing such severe anxiety that it feel exhausting and anxiety inducing just to leave the house. I told him I would be happy to help him find a therapist and a doctor to talk to about what he was experiencing because I‚Äôve been in the same boat with mental health. I also told him I would support him the best I could in dealing with his anxiety. His response? He said ‚Äútherapists don‚Äôt work‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy would I talk to a doctor?‚Äù BRUH. 

Long  story short I feel like I keep offering solutions but also just being there for him and supporting him and nothing helps. I know he‚Äôs going through a hard time but I can‚Äôt help him if he won‚Äôt help himself and I‚Äôm out of empathy. ",1,1745466042.0,ThreadTalkPodcast,0,0.99,False
1k6iqvu,https://i.redd.it/2rhbpfjgepwe1.png,"Built an AI ""Image Artist"" in a day using Cursor","Hey folks üëã

Just wanted to share a fun tool I hacked together in about a day using **Cursor** (and a lot of coffee ‚òï).  
It‚Äôs called **Image Artist** ‚Äî basically a style transfer tool that lets you turn any photo into different artistic styles using AI.

I built this as part of a bigger side project (ZeroStudio), but this specific tool was super fun and surprisingly quick to get running.



# üé® What It Does

Upload any photo, and choose from a set of styles ‚Äî currently includes:

* **Van Gogh**
* **Sketch drawing**
* **Anime filter**
* **Cyberpunk**
* **Oil painting**
   * more coming soon



# ‚öôÔ∏è Stack

* **Frontend**: Vite + Tailwind
* **Backend**: Node.js + Python (FastAPI)
* **Models**: Using pre-trained models from Hugging Face + some tweaks
* **Dev environment**: Built entirely in **Cursor** editor (love the inline AI help)



# üöÄ Try It Free

Upload a pic, select a style, wait \~10 seconds:



# üôè Would Love Feedback

Anything from bugs to feature ideas. Still super early and rough in places, but it works pretty well for what it is.

Also curious ‚Äî anyone else using Cursor as your main IDE these days?

Cheers! üôå

1k6iqep,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/1k6iqep/energy_drinks_make_me_feel_impending_doom/,Energy drinks make me feel impending doom,"My whole life I‚Äôve avoided energy drinks because my mother always told me I would die from a heart attack. Recently, those alani drinks have been getting very popular, and I actually drank a couple a few years back not knowing they were energy drinks, and they were delicious and I had no side effects!! 

So a couple weeks ago I bought the pink slush alani, and it was seriously so delicious and yummy and it just tasted like the color pink. But I went to work a few hours later, and I started to feel extremely jittery and shaken, like I was constantly trembling. I felt so weak like I would faint at any minute. I went to work and felt so ill and scared, just pure doom and agony. I just had to sit down for a little bit, count my breathes and heart rate and drink a lot of water, and I eventually felt a little better. 

Even though I had that reaction, I still thought it was worth it because those alani drinks are so good, even though it‚Äôs probably not good for me!! üò≠ 

I tried a few other flavors too, and now I try to limit myself and limit how much I drink per hour or so. I try to not drink it in a certain time, because it‚Äôs too much for me then. I can still handle them, but I‚Äôm beginning to think caffeine doesn‚Äôt agree with my body.

I think this may be because I stopped drinking coffee a lot years ago, and so maybe my body isn‚Äôt used to it? Idk though it‚Äôs weird 

Does anybody have this same reaction? I wanted to just mention this because I didn‚Äôt think caffeine was something that elevated my anxiety before, but it does! ",1,1745465989.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

Even though I initiated the breakup, it‚Äôs been hell emotionally. Our last conversation wasn‚Äôt great ‚Äî I was upset, raised my voice, and asked him to return a $200 espresso machine that my family gave me for Christmas. He offered to give it back in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to see him and said I‚Äôd send someone to pick it up. He got upset and hung up. That was the last real contact we had.

He did call me once afterward, but didn‚Äôt leave a voicemail, and I missed the call. Since then? Radio silence. He has my address. He knows I want it back. I‚Äôve asked multiple times ‚Äî during our last convo and even before that ‚Äî but still, nothing.

Here‚Äôs where it gets messy: I know I‚Äôm partly using the coffee maker as an excuse to reconnect. I miss him. I didn‚Äôt want to cut ties completely. And honestly, if he gave it back now, it would almost hurt more ‚Äî like closure I don‚Äôt actually want. I‚Äôm scared to reach out because if he‚Äôs cold or indifferent, it‚Äôll sting more than losing a coffee maker ever could.

So my question is:
Do I reach out and ask for it back?
Would that come off as desperate or weak?
Or do I just take the loss, both emotional and financial, and try to move on?

It feels stupid that an espresso machine is what‚Äôs keeping this tether between us, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of a cast iron tea kettle are determined by its key features. Here's a detailed look at the essential specifications that set the best models apart:

**Material and Construction:** The primary material is, of course, cast iron. The quality of the cast iron significantly impacts heat retention, durability, and overall lifespan. High-quality cast iron should be thick, evenly distributed, and free from imperfections. Some kettles feature an enamel coating on the interior to prevent rust and make cleaning easier. The thickness of the cast iron typically ranges from 3mm to 5mm, with thicker walls offering superior heat retention.

**Interior Coating:** Many cast iron tea kettles feature an enamel interior coating to prevent rusting and impart a neutral flavor to the water. The enamel must be food-grade and resistant to chipping or cracking under high heat. Some kettles, however, retain the uncoated cast iron interior, requiring more diligent maintenance but potentially adding subtle mineral notes to the water. A well-applied enamel coating is crucial for the longevity and ease of use of the kettle.

**Handle Design and Heat Resistance:** The handle design is crucial for safe and comfortable pouring. Handles are typically made of cast iron, stainless steel, or heat-resistant materials like wood or wrapped in rope. A well-designed handle will stay relatively cool to the touch during boiling, preventing burns. The handle should also offer a secure and ergonomic grip, making it easy to lift and pour a full kettle. The distance between the handle and the body of the kettle should be sufficient to protect your hand from steam.

**Spout Design and Pouring Precision:** The spout design directly affects the precision and smoothness of the pour. A well-designed spout will prevent drips and allow for controlled pouring, minimizing spills. The angle and length of the spout influence the water flow, with a slightly curved spout generally providing better control. The spout should also be positioned high enough to allow for pouring even when the kettle is nearly full.

**Capacity and Size:** Cast iron tea kettles come in various sizes, typically ranging from 24 oz to 48 oz. The ideal capacity depends on your individual needs and the number of people you typically serve. A smaller kettle is suitable for single servings or small households, while a larger kettle is better for entertaining or frequent tea drinkers. Consider the overall size of the kettle and its footprint on your stovetop.

**Lid and Infuser (if included):** The lid should fit snugly to prevent steam from escaping and to maintain the water temperature. A well-fitting lid also minimizes rattling during boiling. Some cast iron tea kettles include a stainless steel infuser for brewing loose-leaf tea directly in the kettle. The infuser should be removable for easy cleaning and versatile enough to accommodate various tea types. The quality and design of the lid and infuser contribute to the overall functionality and user experience of the kettle.

 ## Core Benefits

A cast iron tea kettle offers several unique benefits that contribute to an enhanced tea-drinking experience.

**Superior Heat Retention:** Cast iron's inherent property of retaining heat is a significant advantage. Once the water is boiled, the kettle maintains the temperature for an extended period, reducing the need for frequent reheating. This is particularly beneficial for tea drinkers who enjoy multiple cups or prefer to savor their tea over a longer period. The consistent temperature also aids in optimal tea steeping, extracting the full flavor and aroma from the leaves.

**Enhanced Flavor of Tea:** Many tea enthusiasts believe that cast iron kettles enhance the flavor of tea. Over time, the cast iron can impart subtle mineral notes to the water, creating a smoother and more nuanced taste profile. This is particularly noticeable with certain types of tea, such as green tea or delicate herbal blends. The even heat distribution of cast iron also contributes to optimal extraction of flavor compounds from the tea leaves.

**Durability and Longevity:** Cast iron is renowned for its exceptional durability and longevity. A well-maintained cast iron tea kettle can last for generations, becoming a cherished heirloom. The robust construction resists dents, scratches, and other forms of damage, making it a reliable investment. Unlike kettles made from other materials, cast iron is less prone to warping or cracking under high heat.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** Cast iron tea kettles possess a unique aesthetic appeal that adds a touch of elegance and rustic charm to any kitchen. The traditional designs and textured surfaces create a visually appealing centerpiece. Many kettles are available in various colors and finishes, allowing you to choose one that complements your kitchen dËåÖcor. The timeless design ensures that your cast iron kettle will remain a stylish addition to your home for years to come.

**Even Heat Distribution:** Cast iron provides unparalleled even heat distribution, ensuring that water heats evenly throughout the kettle. This uniform heating prevents hot spots and contributes to a more consistent and predictable boiling process. The even heat distribution also helps to prevent scorching or burning of the tea leaves when brewing directly in the kettle with an infuser.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about cast iron tea kettles:

**Is a cast iron tea kettle safe to use on all types of stovetops?**
   Yes, cast iron tea kettles are generally safe to use on most stovetops, including gas, electric, and induction. However, it's essential to check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure compatibility with your specific stovetop. Using a trivet or heat diffuser on glass or ceramic stovetops is recommended to prevent scratches or damage.

**How do I clean and maintain a cast iron tea kettle?**
   Cleaning and maintaining a cast iron tea kettle involves a few simple steps. After each use, rinse the kettle with warm water and dry it thoroughly. Avoid using soap or harsh detergents, as they can damage the enamel coating or affect the flavor of the water. For uncoated cast iron interiors, gently scrub with a soft brush and dry immediately to prevent rust. Regularly inspect the kettle for signs of rust and address them promptly with a rust remover or by seasoning the interior with oil.

**Will a cast iron tea kettle rust?**
   Cast iron is susceptible to rust, especially if exposed to moisture for extended periods. Kettles with enamel interiors are less prone to rusting, but it's still essential to dry them thoroughly after each use. For kettles with uncoated cast iron interiors, regular seasoning with oil can help prevent rust. If rust does occur, it can be removed with a rust remover or by scrubbing with a steel wool pad, followed by seasoning.

**Can I use a cast iron tea kettle to heat liquids other than water?**
   While cast iron tea kettles are primarily designed for boiling water, you can use them to heat other liquids, such as broth or mulled wine. However, it's essential to clean the kettle thoroughly after each use to prevent residue buildup or flavor contamination. Avoid heating acidic liquids, such as tomato sauce or lemon juice, as they can damage the enamel coating or react with the cast iron.

But I think at some point 5 years or more, is when things got really bad. Where I was experiencing diarrhea multiple times a day, to the point where I bought Metamucil for the first time and seen what a healthy stool should look like. 

Unfortunately that didn't lead me down a road of fully taking my gut seriously. That took a couple more years, as I was still eating tons of sugar and fast food. To when eventually, I haad developed jaundice in my eyes, had a large goiter on my thyroid, was dealing with with fissures every other day. And it still wasn't clicking in my head. 

Like I never did hard drugs, I barely was a drinker either. But I truly believed that I has fried my brain so bad, just by the years and years of unbalanced eating. I mean back when I lived at home with family, I had ate more real food. Once I had moved out though? 

That's basically when I was mainly eating ramen noodles with the seasoning packet, literally everyday. I was eating oatmeal with no fruit, no nuts, well sometimes I would have raisins and cinnamon with milk. But then I would pour like 4 tablespoons of sugar on it. Then a few hours later I would eat some Honey Smacks. Eat a white bread sandwich with either cold cuts and cheese or pb&j. Eat ice cream every night as well too. And when I was outside the house, it was mainly sugary granola bars, coffee with sugar and more. 

Ok so with that being just a tiny portion of the bs I ate. You could imagine what it was doing to my liver, pancreas, losing all my minerals thru constant diarrhea and just drinking plain water or tbh most likely juice afterwards. 

I had recently come to a probability, that I may be suffering from Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. As my colon would always stuff up, specifically after beans. But then it would get painful at times, after eating things with seeds like blueberries. I don't remember what conclusion I had came to, but it essentially led me to adding salt to my water. 

Which after that I noticed some symptoms were finally easing up. My swollen feet that would appear, after I had drank plain water following a meal. As well as swollen hands, head and even stomach will stoop retaining water. The thing is my stools are still kind of hard to pass. One is due to hemorrhoids I would say and the other is due to electrolytes imbalance. 

I know im supposed to be experiencing diarrhea with some of these foods. Like beans, multiple servings of coconut/sunflower butter. I want to get my colonoscopy rescheduled again, but I need to fix this imbalance. As last time I attempted the prep for the procedure. I almost passed out due to my brain feeling like it had no oxygen. 

The salt has been helping just some. And I take 210 MG of magnesium a day. If I take the 420mg I end up with heart palpitations. Also tried taking the other half of citrate and ending up with weird body pains? So I'm wondering will just taking standard electrolyte mixtures fix things back? I also forgot to mention, I suffer with adrenal fatigue. So that probably burns a lot of those salt reserves. ",1,1745464236.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

Context: we‚Äôve been texting kind of long-distance for a bit since he works abroad, we‚Äôd talk daily, and he even sent me gifts/uber from overseas. We knew each other in middle school and reconnected this year, so this is our first real time together as adults.

When he finally came back here, we had ‚Äútwo‚Äù dates. One was casual, just coffee and hours of talking in his car, and the other was a fancy dinner. Both times, he was super affectionate, kissing my forehead and my hand, calling me ‚Äúhis doll,‚Äù saying he wants me to have his babies, said we should plan a trip together, wants to take me line-dancing for the first time... making all these super romantic plans.

But fast forward to last week and suddenly... he‚Äôs just off. No more good morning texts, barely replies, no effort to make plans even though he‚Äôs leaving the country again soon. And to top it all off, my birthday is literally around the corner and he has like no sense of urgency to make the most of his time with me.

I‚Äôve made peace with the fact that I won‚Äôt be texting him to say I‚Äôm upset. I feel like if he really wanted something serious, he‚Äôd be doing things without me having to ask. But here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused: even when he barely texts, he still throws in things like ‚Äúmy baby‚Äù or ‚Äúprettiest girl‚Äù and just yesterday he sent me a pic of the designer bag he got his mom for Mother‚Äôs Day with a ‚Äúthis could be for you‚Äù.

Is this textbook love bombing or... This whole hot and cold dynamic is definitely getting to me. Even though I‚Äôm seeing other people and I‚Äôm not that emotionally attached to him yet, it still affects me.

1k6i469,https://www.reddit.com/r/TraumaTherapy/comments/1k6i469/therapist_annoyed_that_i_want_to_talk_about_trauma/,Therapist annoyed that I want to talk about trauma?,"I've been seeing my therapist for about a year. We mainly speak about current issues, issues with my latest relationship, family stuff, work stuff. She's a clinical psych and she's highly qualified in emdr, dbt, cbt and is extremely trauma specialised supposedly but I don't feel like she is. Our therapy has been a lot of talking and some homework sheet type exercises but I'm never in my feelings during sessions and don't talk much about the past. She's helped a lot though but it feels like a very clincal relationship. 

 I also have a history cptsd and have had a string of emotionally (maybe verging on physically) abusive relationships. One relationship ended a few years ago but was extremely emotionally abusive and ended very badly with police involved and my ex pretending to kill himself over the phone to me and blaming me for it, and letting me believe he was dead for weeks etc. I also felt very unsafe with him at one point and he technically SA me to. He was EXTREMELY manipulative and lied about so many things throughout (eg everyone hating me, or he'd make up stories about himself) so I was very gaslit (see my post history for more details). 

I saw my therapist today for the first time in a few weeks and I feel immensly triggered. 

We hadn't had a session in 3 weeks because of insurance issues but we were granted 20 more and today was the first one back. And I found her so invalidating. 

Last time we'd spoken briefly about maybe having additional sessions focussing on needing to feel seen or heard or witnessed with my experiences (mainly with family as they are very crazy-making / gaslighty) and how that maybe wasn't healthy of me (as I'll call a friend or bf to vent about what has happened and feel like I needed someone there) and that I needed to give myself that validation. 

She asked how I'd been and I spoke a bit about my parents and how things are slightly better if I treat them as if they are 5yo children because emotionally they are stuck there, so it helps to view them in that way so I feel less resentful. I mentioned some of the neglect etc or things like as an adult having to teach them basic hyhiene and she started asking about their childhoods (which she knows were awful) and ofc I know that they are that way because of this, and so we ended up just talking about how they had it bad as kids too but without any real recognition for how I was impacted. 

And then she asked what we should talk about for the remaining sessions as I seemed to be doing much better, and did we even need more sessions? And I said that something I'd been struggling with was getting a lot of anxiety and physical symptoms whenever I see someone who looks like my ex or go into a similar location where he could be (which is all the time atm) and that I think about him all the time (in an anxious or running through scenarios way, not an ""I miss him"" way) and can't stop, and it's horrible to constantly feel triggered and that maybe it'd be good to go through it and that happened and reprocess it, as I don't remember a lot of what happened with him and never felt like I processed it in a healthy way. It's not that I can't remember.... if I think about it I remember more things, but it's upsetting and so I don't delve into those memories. I said I felt I needed to reprocess what happened and that might mean going into it again.

And she just seemed really annoyed. She said if it distressed me to talk about it or remember it why would it be helpful to remember more? She said she didn't understand why i was bringing him up again as we discussed 3 weeeks ago how we'd use these sessions around the needing someone to witness my experience and suddenly I wanted to go back to talking about my ex? And that we'd already had 5 sessions 8 months ago talking about him (I'd talked factually about some things he'd done and given a rough timeline of events but we hadnt done anything with it other than the grounding techniques and it didn't help me reprocess what happened, so I stressed that I really felt that I needed help actually processing the trauma). She said we'd sorted it and I explained that it had felt more managable then when i lived hours away but now I'm in the area he lives its really triggering again and also I'm afraid of what might happen if he sees me. 

She said that I just needed to do grounding techniques when I felt anxious and that it felt like I was just looking for a reason to want to keep talking about him. It made me feel like she felt I just wanted attention? She said that she felt that I was just wanting someone to witness and go through events that we'd already gone through. I found it really dismissive and shaming and I don't feel like she took it seriously when I said that this stuff really upset me and interferes with my life and I think I need to go to the route cause, not just treat the symptoms by deep breathing every time I get triggered. She seemed to think I was just trying to find something to be upset about (my ex) to continue the therapy sesssions, or that I  wanted to just be able to complain all day and get validation and stay stuck in the past just to keep reliving it so that it felt witnessed and I felt validated. 

She did ask if there was one key memory that triggered me, so she could do emdr but then seemed annoyed when I couldn't pick one but said that I had so many different memories that were all really distressing and it was all a blur anyway. I've also had emdr once before for this with a different therapist and I disasociated so we stopped after 10 mins. She said it wasn't like I was having nightmares about him (I used to) but didn't say anything when I said I dreamed about him but I wouldn't call it nightmares. 

Sorry for the rant. I'm just feeling really frustrated and even more shamed for feeling triggered, like I'm just doing it to subconsciously stay the victim or for attention. Like today someone who looked a lot like him walked by glaring through the window and I had to pack up and leave the coffee shop because my heart was pounding so much, I'm not exaggerating or making it up... But I feel like the fact it upset me still means there's something wrong with me and that people will think I'm attention seeking.    

I feel frustrated that I keep trying to find good trauma therapists and so many just say ""well he's not in your life now so why focus on the past?"". And we just focus on current everyday things and never deal with the actual issue. I don't feel understood and yet I know a lot of psychology theory and surely it's normal with trauma to struggle with flasbacks and physiological symptoms even years later? So why do they invalidate me? 

I feel like she thinks I should be over this and it's a bad breakup but to move on. I don't think she understands... Same with my family trauma... I know they had hard lives too but that doesn't excuse the way they treat me? But it's so confusing when she's been so helpful and amazing on other things and I don't want to bail on another therapist because I didn't like what they said or they challenged me. My ex said I'd keep finding therapists till one just agrees with me on everything and I'm worried about doing that, but at the same time these things feel like red flags to me.

What do I do and how do I deal with it? Is this normal?

TL: DR therapist is irritated when I try to discuss past dv relationship and trauma, because she feels it's not a problem now and I just want to talk for the sake of it / validation. ",3,1745463980.0,TraumaTherapy,1,1.0,False
1k6i32e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1k6i32e/was_this_a_crazy_breakup_or_it_makes_sense_long/,Was this a crazy breakup or it makes sense? [LONG READ],"
My ex and I were together almost 2 years (broke up a week before 2 years) and were planing to move to Colorado together in July. So on 4/7 my ex and I went out to a sports bar to watch a super popular basketball game that had the whole city excited. It was a great night and I was sober because I was DD that night, after the win we decided we want to go to a bar that‚Äôs downtown which is where I live. I end up giving her friends a ride as well as Ubers were busy and when we reached the main part of the city, there was so much traffic and roads blocked off. So we decided to leave my car in a random parking lot and this makes me stressed because I had work at 7am and it was almost midnight and I‚Äôd have to go get my car even earlier. 

Then it starts raining and we all have to use the bathroom and it‚Äôs incredibly crowded in the Main Street with people walking. My ex decides to run into the crowd with her friend leaving me behind and no cell service and lost her in the crowd. I end up getting annoyed at that and when we eventually find each other again I let her know. But I decided I‚Äôll wait until we‚Äôre alone to discus this because it‚Äôs a repeated behavior where she does something without thinking about how I‚Äôd feel. I was scared when she ran off like that it was overwhelming. 

So anyways we end up having to walk to mine in the rain for 20 minutes and I‚Äôve already decided I‚Äôm not going out and I told her that and she seemed on board but kept asking me the whole walk back what‚Äôs wrong?? And wanted to talk about it right then but I decided it‚Äôd be best in private so I told her to wait. 

We get to mine and I start talking about it and she starts being like I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to do that but it‚Äôs not a big deal and it felt like she was invalidating it and starts saying she just wanted to have a good night and not argue. I told her she keeps ignoring my attempt to discuss this and she says it‚Äôs because she still wants to go out to the bar downtown with friends she was going to meet and saying she just wants a good night. I get angry at her because I DD her to the sports bar and we had a great time and I had to leave my car at a random place, get rained on, and I had to get up early for work soon and tell her she didn‚Äôt have a good night?? 

She starts crying hysterically and I honestly was so confused why and repeating over and over she just wanted a good night and I was caught off guard so I didn‚Äôt comfort her at first instead got angry that I had to comfort her while she wasn‚Äôt hearing me out. I know I shouldn‚Äôt and regret that I was continuing to raise my voice at her about why I‚Äôm upset and she ends up going to the toilet dry heaving and I do comfort her then because I‚Äôm concerned why she‚Äôs crying so hard. 

I think it stems from her graduating college in 2 weeks and she think she was missing out and I told her that and she said no I just want to go! (Which she later gas lights me that she didn‚Äôt say that) I get angry that she wants to avoid the discussion just so she can continue to party and blame having a bad night on me. We always are the type of couple to discuss things and not run away. She also told me she‚Äôd give me a ride in the morning because her car is parked at my garage but then admits to me she doesn‚Äôt have her key on her so now I have to uber. 

She ends up saying she wants to go home and I get her an uber home and then I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but then I start messaging her like crazy that she‚Äôs avoiding things and I don‚Äôt understand her and I regret accusing her of things such as she doesn‚Äôt love the same anymore. She barely replied and just said she needed space and doesn‚Äôt know what to say besides sorry she‚Äôs selfish. 

The next day she offers me a ride to my car with her roommates car which I accept and we agree to not talk about things then as I had to go to work. I then angrily text that she had me begging to talk to her like she liked it or something (which was only out of anger and I didn‚Äôt truly mean) and she gets extremely upset at that and says wtf don‚Äôt say shit you don‚Äôt mean. 

When we talk later at night I find out she‚Äôs still highly offended by that comment because it questions her character and she doesn‚Äôt like me saying things out of anger. I apologize for everything I did wrong such as yelling, not comforting her, and accusing her of things. She still sticks by saying what happened when she ran away with her friend wasn‚Äôt a big until she sees she‚Äôs invalidating me and ends up saying okay I‚Äôm sorry. She calls me out for the way I deal with things and I tell her I‚Äôm trying to change by starting therapy 4 months ago and she told me she would start as well but she never did and she does acknowledge that she said that and never followed through. She also told her roommate about the whole argument the moment she went home that night and her roommate told her she likes us together and hopes we can fix things.

We go to bed with things still feeling off but we decide to accept what was said and try to move on. Wednesday and Thursday still feel off so I offer a date to help us get back to normal. Thursday she annoyed me again because she told me she‚Äôd be at mine around 12am which was already late but I accepted it and then around 1am I check on her and she says she stopped at her friends apt who lives underneath me to talk about a road trip they‚Äôre planning. I get angry and tell her she‚Äôs keeping me up and once again being inconsiderate with her actions and how it affects me who needs to sleep for work and she should‚Äôve just not said she could come over. 

Friday is the day of our date, I meet her at a coffee shop around noon that day and we‚Äôre acting the most normal we have all week being lovey dovey and all. By our date time I think things are going well until she tells me she‚Äôs upset still about what I said and she needs time to think. We end up deciding to not to do our date and I drop her off and when I do it‚Äôs a very emotional goodbye both of us crying and it felt very scary because we don‚Äôt that ever. 

But anyway next day comes and she asks if we could speak tn but then quickly at 2pm she says she misses me and wants me to come over ASAP. She ends up surprising me with flowers and says she forgives me and I‚Äôm her person and her home and she always wants me in her life. Then the rest of the day it feels everything is back to normal. We continued to plan our future in Colorado that night, she reassured many times that week that she wouldn‚Äôt breakup with me and asked if I was asking because I was thinking about doing it?

Another backstory, I have OCD and struggle with retroactive jealously which has been a problem in our relationship before but she‚Äôs tried to work on it with me. Sunday morning I wake up with a lot of intrusive thoughts and I end up doing something so stupid and I regret so hard, I look through her camera roll because I was looking for her past pictures with Ex‚Äôs to compare and hurt my feelings. I end up hurting my own feelings with stupid insecurities and ask her questions. 

She gets annoyed and says she feels like we‚Äôre always arguing now and I tell her I‚Äôm sorry and I know it‚Äôs nothing she did it is just my insecurity. I end up telling her 2 hours later that I looked through her phone and she surprisingly says she‚Äôs not angry or upset and she appreciates the honesty but she is pretty numb now to my retroactive jealousy. She says she knows she should be angry but she‚Äôs not even surprised. 

Then she asks if I‚Äôve ever thought of breaking up and I say no and she admits that she did for the first time this week and it scared her because she thought what if she would be okay. I end up crying and go hide in her room to cry which she follows me and also starts intensely crying. She ends up asking ‚Äúwhat is going on??‚Äù And I tell her I don‚Äôt know and she says she just didn‚Äôt have time to process that thought and how serious it is and I remind her I gave her space but she‚Äôs the one that wanted to meet up so quickly after. 

Anyways she ends up suggesting a break which I decline and tell her that‚Äôs for slow burn breakups. She then says I think we should break up which shattered my heart and also spiked my anxiety. I started thinking about how I told my job I‚Äôm quitting to move to Colorado, I already had a job lining up there, I sent my clothes there, we already paid for a full week trip to Oregon. She didn‚Äôt have any solutions to these plans when she dropped it because she said it was so sudden. She kept going back and forth saying she‚Äôs not sure if she wants to break up, she needs time to think, she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants, I‚Äôm her person, she‚Äôs happy with me but continues to stick to the breaking up plan. 

I‚Äôm heartbroken and so confused and she ends up taking advantage of my vulnerability by asking me to cuddle and it‚Äôs awful because we spent the whole talking about how it‚Äôs our last time while she kept saying she needs time to think. In the morning I leave and she still says she needs time and I end up telling my sister who lives in NY and I‚Äôm distraught and she suggests I come stay with her for the week. I do and I let my ex know and we decide we‚Äôll talk when I‚Äôm back. 

I start spiraling not sure whether to really expect a breakup or not as she said she needs to think so I end up texting her that I need to know as other things are at stake as well. She tells me yes we‚Äôre breaking up and I get so hurt that she strung me along for 2 days of that. We end up talking in the phone which she didn‚Äôt want she wanted to meet in person but I said no and talking about our plans and how to reverse them and that she‚Äôs breaking up with me for me to grow because of my insecurities and she thinks she‚Äôs holding me back. 

She doesnt share much else and it‚Äôs a hard goodbye of saying I love yous and talking about the future we wanted. We then only talk from there a little over text about flights and hotels we booked. The last time I texted her was Saturday telling her I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and if she‚Äôs sure about this. She said ‚Äúhi i haven‚Äôt stopping thinking about you either. it‚Äôs not that i never want to see you again. i love you and i know i always will. but i think for both of us to truly grow, we need to be apart.‚Äù And im just heartbroken. I gave her stuff from my apt to her friend who said she‚Äôd let me know when my ex gives her my stuff. It‚Äôs been 3 days and I haven‚Äôt heard from her or gotten my stuff back. I also forgot to mention that week and this week are crazy for her regarding finals exam and projects. Was this a crazy breakup? ",1,1745463885.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

I get angry and tell her she‚Äôs keeping me up and once again being inconsiderate with her actions and how it affects me who needs to sleep for work and she should‚Äôve just not said she could come over. 

Friday is the day of our date, I meet her at a coffee shop around noon that day and we‚Äôre acting the most normal we have all week being lovey dovey and all. By our date time I think things are going well until she tells me she‚Äôs upset still about what I said and she needs time to think. We end up deciding to not to do our date and I drop her off and when I do it‚Äôs a very emotional goodbye both of us crying and it felt very scary because we don‚Äôt that ever. 

But anyway next day comes and she asks if we could speak tn but then quickly at 2pm she says she misses me and wants me to come over ASAP. She ends up surprising me with flowers and says she forgives me and I‚Äôm her person and her home and she always wants me in her life. Then the rest of the day it feels everything is back to normal. We even continued to plan our future in Colorado and she didn‚Äôt mention anything about wanting to break up, if anything she reassured me multiple times during this week that she wouldn‚Äôt! 

Another backstory, I have OCD and struggle with retroactive jealously which has been a problem in our relationship before but she‚Äôs tried to work on it with me. Sunday morning I wake up with a lot of intrusive thoughts and I end up doing something so stupid and I regret so hard, I look through her camera roll because I was looking for her past pictures with Ex‚Äôs to compare and hurt my feelings. I end up hurting my own feelings with stupid insecurities and ask her questions. 

She gets annoyed and says she feels like we‚Äôre always arguing now and I tell her I‚Äôm sorry and I know it‚Äôs nothing she did it is just my insecurity. I end up telling her 2 hours later that I looked through her phone and she surprisingly says she‚Äôs not angry or upset and she appreciates the honesty but she is pretty numb now to my retroactive jealousy. She says she knows she should be angry but she‚Äôs not even surprised. 

Then she asks if I‚Äôve ever thought of breaking up and I say no and she admits that she did for the first time this week and it scared her because she thought what if she would be okay. I end up crying and go hide in her room to cry which she follows me and also starts intensely crying. She ends up asking ‚Äúwhat is going on??‚Äù And I tell her I don‚Äôt know and she says she just didn‚Äôt have time to process that thought and how serious it is and I remind her I gave her space but she‚Äôs the one that wanted to meet up so quickly after. 

Anyways she ends up suggesting a break which I decline and tell her that‚Äôs for slow burn breakups. She then says I think we should break up which shattered my heart and also spiked my anxiety. I started thinking about how I told my job I‚Äôm quitting to move to Colorado, I already had a job lining up there, I sent my clothes there, we already paid for a full week trip to Oregon. She didn‚Äôt have any solutions to these plans when she dropped it because she said it was so sudden. She kept going back and forth saying she‚Äôs not sure if she wants to break up, she needs time to think, she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants, I‚Äôm her person, she‚Äôs happy with me but continues to stick to the breaking up plan. 

I‚Äôm heartbroken and so confused and she ends up taking advantage of my vulnerability by asking me to cuddle and it‚Äôs awful because we spent the whole talking about how it‚Äôs our last time while she kept saying she needs time to think. In the morning I leave and she still says she needs time and I end up telling my sister who lives in NY and I‚Äôm distraught and she suggests I come stay with her for the week. I do and I let my ex know and we decide we‚Äôll talk when I‚Äôm back. 

I start spiraling not sure whether to really expect a breakup or not as she said she needs to think so I end up texting her that I need to know as other things are at stake as well. She tells me yes we‚Äôre breaking up and I get so hurt that she strung me along for 2 days of that. We end up talking in the phone which she didn‚Äôt want she wanted to meet in person but I said no and talking about our plans and how to reverse them and that she‚Äôs breaking up with me for me to grow because of my insecurities and she thinks she‚Äôs holding me back. 

She doesnt share much else and it‚Äôs a hard goodbye of saying I love yous and talking about the future we wanted. We then only talk from there a little over text about flights and hotels we booked. The last time I texted her was Saturday telling her I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and if she‚Äôs sure about this. She said ‚Äúhi i haven‚Äôt stopping thinking about you either. it‚Äôs not that i never want to see you again. i love you and i know i always will. but i think for both of us to truly grow, we need to be apart.‚Äù And im just heartbroken. I gave her stuff from my apt to her friend who said she‚Äôd let me know when my ex gives her my stuff. It‚Äôs been 3 days and I haven‚Äôt heard from her or gotten my stuff back. I also forgot to mention that week and this week are crazy for her regarding finals exam and projects. Was this a crazy breakup? ",1,1745463853.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

The song is fine, but it‚Äôs overrated and does not represent his musical style well. It doesn‚Äôt even feature his trumpet playing. It‚Äôs basically a ‚Äújazz‚Äù (not really) song for people who don‚Äôt like jazz.

If the only Louis Armstrong song you‚Äôve ever heard is ‚ÄúWhat a Wonderful World,‚Äù turn off your radio and look up:

A Kiss to Build a Dream On

La Vie en Rose (my personal favorite)

Hello Dolly

The Frim Fram Sauce

Zat You, Santa Claus

St. Louis Blues

You see, Satchmo was not a singer by trade. Yes, he sang, but that was not what made his music great. His primary instrument was the trumpet. He was a trumpeter who could sing. Not a singer who could play the trumpet. And have you ever noticed what makes ‚ÄúWhat a Wonderful World‚Äù inferior to his other hit songs?

There‚Äôs no trumpet! It‚Äôs also just a very poppy and non-jazzy tune. Satchmo was a jazz musician, not a pop singer. He‚Äôs just way out of his element in this song. He‚Äôs a round peg trying to fit into a square hole.

Liking Louis Armstrong because of ‚ÄúWhat a Wonderful World‚Äù is akin to liking Starbucks because of their lemonade. I mean yeah, their lemonade is fine, but no one goes to Starbucks to get lemonade. They go to get coffee. And I don‚Äôt go to Louis Armstrong to listen to a 1960s pop ballad.

1k6i210,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k6i210/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_be_friends_with_my/,AITAH for not wanting to be friends with my junkie friend?,"Warning: Long ass story and supbar writing

My friend has had problems with drug abuse for years, she has been addicted to weed, speed, and most recently, cocaine.

The problem first showed up a year and a half ago when she admitted to me shes addicted to speed while she was driving us to her place so we can jam together (no innuendo, I play bass and she plays guitar). I was shocked and asked how this happened, she admitted her ex got her hooked which became a trope, she gets in a relationship, does drugs with them and then gets hooked to said drug. What made it worse is that she admitted she was high currently and didnt sleep for 2 days, I feared for my life because she isnt the best driver and under the influence AND 2 days of no sleep all spelled out car crash to me.

Thankfully she didnt crash but during our jam sesh she was barely doing anything, not cooperative with my playing, got very agressive out of nowhere and she took breaks every 30 minutes to do a small line. I gave up on playing and instead chose to have a one on one with her, telling her about my past experiences with drug addicts and my childhood which was filled with all kinds of trauma which I have no need to go into right now. When I opened up about my dating life and how my last experience left me with severe trust issues she called me a pussy and told me it wasnt that big of a deal (it might not have been but for me, emotionally, it was devastating).

After I ordered a taxi home I chose not to speak with her for a year, I didnt feel qualified to talk her out of it since I myself was addicted to weed and I had a feeling she wouldnt have listened to me anyways, no matter how much I cared. 

The year passes and she calls me to have a drink with her, I accept her invitation but was very nervous about how it will go. We sat in a loud bar, we order drinks and start talking a bit. She tells me she has been getting therapy and how it helped her get over some past trauma and I congratulate her, I share my own sober journey of quitting weed, getting theraoy and cutting out some bad influencing friends from my life. Generally we had a good talk but she was going to the bathroom every 15 minutes, some alarms go off in my head and I ask her if she has an infected bladder or something. She admits shes doing cocaine. I cant explain the level of disappointment I felt, though I ask her how she started doing it and how she gets the money to do it since its an expensive product and shes a student with no job. You mightve guessed already, she met a girl who does cocaine, got hooked and she gets the money from her parents who dont know shes doing drugs again. I tell her why doesnt she go to rehab and she shares her past trauma from being sent to a madhouse where they made her take 11 pills a day and didnt let her out for 4 months (btw she has psychosis and an anxiety disorder). This is the first time I hear about this and I feel bad obviously but I still tell her she should seek help about it.

We meet up a month later, we kinda gave up on jamming sessions since she doesnt like playing the guitar anymore so we only go out for coffee or a beer, and during our meet she tells me she has a new therapist who by description seems amazing. She tells me how shes been getting better and even started doing some rock climbing in her free time, I was thrilled to learn this and she even says shes quit drugs which I was overjoyed to hear. She also shares of 2 relationships she has been in since we last met up, I find it strange how in a month she was in 2 relationships and even more strange that one of them is a guy cause shes been a lesbian up till then, though I was still glad shes discovering more things about herself. That was the best one on one time we had up till then, and it filled me with hope for her.

A few weeks after that last meet, she calls me and asks for me to send some money since she ran out and her parents dont trust her anymore cause of all the drug escapades. It was 20 euros so I see no harm in it, I sent her the money and she said she will pay me back the next day. 2 days later I ask her if she has the money and that its no big deal if she cant pay it back, she responds saying that she needs 40 more and promises to pay me back next week. Im not an idiot to not see what was happening but I was hopeful it wasnt what I thought it was, she also said its an emergency and that shes going skiing over the weekend with her family, promises to pay it back and so on. I sent the money and I wait a week. Not missing a day, I ask her if she has the money, I am not ashamed to admit it but 60 euros was a good chunk of my minimal wage, especially with my own personal life problems that I wont get into (not any addictions fyi). She tells me she cant pay it back yet since her parents caught her.

I of course ask her if the money was actually for drugs, to which she responded ""yurrrr"". I am not a person thats prone to anger but her carelessness made my blood boil. I ghosted her, I wanted to yell at her, call her all kinds of names but I chose to just stay silent and quietly drop her from my life. She a week later sent me ""I will make it right"" and I wrote back a long message about everything she did wrong and how her actions influence the people around her as well as herself, I also said that her jumping from relationship to relationship seems to me like seeking dopamine wherever she could get it and I question if she actually felt any romance in those relationships. I admit I was mean spirited but I had to tell her everything that was on my mind about her life and I told her at the end of the message that I really do hope we can be friends again though I refuse to be friends with a junkie.

A week ago she asks me if I could meet up, tells me she can repay me and just wants to talk. Though I really didnt want to, I agreed, I wanted an apology face to face. We meet up, do a little hug and sit down in her favourite bar. She apologizes, says that what she did was wrong and that shes on new medication, then starts talking about what shes been doing in the last few months. I felt that old spark we had when we were jamming buddies, just talking about music and wild parties we were at, though my life became quite boring since I stopped drinking and smoking weed, but getting a cat has been amazing. We talked for a while and then she admitted she made out with one of my old friends last night while she was horribly drunk. I was surprised but it is what it is, not my business, hes a really nice guy anyways who wouldnt take advantage of someone, she even admitted she came onto him. Some time passed and she goes to the bathroom and comes back with wide eyes. I recognized her being high immediately and just gave her a disappointing look. We start arguing and it all boils down to her saying she only does cocaine once a week now and it being a process, and with me saying its been a few months and that mixing medication with cocaine and alcohol isnt a good idea anyways and of course asking her why she does it if shes on the medication she wanted.

We parted ways an hour later and here we are. We havent spoken since and its been on my mind a bit too much.

Should I just abandon her or should I try to work through it? Any advice helps, thank you.",2,1745463790.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1k6i1ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1k6i1ms/student_studying_a_naturalistic_observation/,Student ‚ÄúStudying‚Äù: A Naturalistic Observation,"I often frequent a couple local coffee shops. From my perch, I am able to observe the screens of random college students who ‚Äúwork‚Äù from these locations. I present unsystematic results from my observations of several students this semester. 

**ChatGPT is Always Open**

On their laptops and/or phones, ChatGPT is open all the time. This is true among nearly all participants I have observed. Gemini, Claude - I‚Äôm not seeing much of you. 

**Google Docs is King**

Virtually no students use MS Word. Google Docs is easily the preferred word processor.

**Frequent Task Shifting**

Students often move between tasks. Work on academic tasks is short-lived, in bursts ranging from <1 minute to perhaps 10 minutes. Students often have longer bursts shopping online than working on academic work.

Students check their phone at least once every five minutes - often much more often than that. Texting, checking email, taking photos of their laptop screen to feed into ChatGPT, Spotify/Apple Music, web browsers of shopping sites. All common. Less social media use than I expected, though.

**Copy/Paste**

I‚Äôve read on this sub that students are computer illiterate. I‚Äôm here to tell you that their copy/paste skills are better than any other group of people on the planet. Copy assignment instructions, paste into ChatGPT, then copy output and paste back into discussion editor in LMS or into Google Doc - these folks are absolute masters at copy/paste.

Some students do check the output. Others seem to copy/paste ChatGPT output without much or any reading.

**AI for Good Uses?**

I have seen a couple of students who seemed to use ChatGPT to generate study questions for them. I couldn‚Äôt tell what they were feeding into ChatGPT to generate them, but I can see a legitimate use of AI for this purpose if it is fed correct material and given appropriate prompts (with the usual caveat that it might generate BS).

**We Don't Need No Stinking Textbooks**

I have not seen a physical textbook. I have occasionally witnessed what is likely an e-textbook appear in a web browser. But I see much more time spent in ChatGPT than in reading textbooks or any other academic materials. 

**LMS**

This is how I know they are college students - the LMS webpages. They are often visited. Course announcements and assignments are viewed often. But assigned readings - I don't see much reading of anything that looks academic. 

**Typical Session**

If they come in a group, no work is getting done, expect for one pair of students who actually focus and do what us professors would all agree is solid academic work. A typical individual student opens their MacBook (laptops are nearly all MacBooks), often paired with an iPad as a second screen. They start strong by logging into their LMS. After less than 3 minutes, they are on their phone, shopping, or fiddling with headphones. They loosely work on a Google Doc, either 1) producing a sentence or 2) pasting something from ChatGPT, then moving onto checking their phone for several minutes longer than they worked on the document. 

They usually work on academic work and/or having ChatGPT do their work for an average of no more than five consecutive minutes before they do something else. I'm not kidding. And on their phones, it almost gives me a headache as they pop in and out of apps rapidly. It's enough to make this observer panic about the total lack of an attention span.

The median student studying on their own is on-task (doing academic work and/or prompting ChatGPT) for about 15-20% of the time at the coffee shop. 

The total lack of reading a textbook or anything that looks like an academic document in most of these sessions is my most remarkable observation. They are also not watching online lectures. 

**Limitations**

Lots. Students attend several colleges, ranging from community colleges to ""we let in anyone with a pulse"" 4-year colleges to the rare student from a more selective college. They are very young. I hope that I am catching a worse than average sample. 

I was in a different town a few months ago, in a coffee shop. I saw several students there with actual textbooks who were clearly doing real studying. One student brought a whiteboard and made herself test questions, erased them, then made more of them. She was not messing around. This was by a selective, well-regarded college and it made me think that maybe there are still some pockets of hard-working students. Not what I see in the coffee shops near me, unfortunately.

**Conclusions**

This has been very disheartening. If these results are generalizable, then I recommend abandoning all hope. Most of these people are not doing college-level studying. Much more time is spent in ChatGPT than in the textbook. And that is not because they are ChatGPT geniuses. It's because textbooks and reading in general seem to be endangered.

I'm curious if anyone else has surreptitiously observed students studying in naturalistic settings since the advent of widespread AI use. If so, please share.

Nuun leaves chunks in your water and isn‚Äôt the saltiest. LMNT, on the other hand, is a fan favorite but was too salty for me. They don‚Äôt even try to hide pot, giving names like ‚Äòraspberry salt‚Äô. Gatorade is a good drink but a terrible drink mix. Bad flavor, lots of sweetener, bad dissolving.

I will add them to my juice, coffees, smoothies, but cannot have it in plain water or black tea. Also on this tier, Liquid IV. Simply not my thing in flavor, and I like little more salt in mine. It‚Äôs also pretty expensive.

Next tier, Gu. I loved this one for so long but can no longer drink it because even smelling it gives me a headache, likely because I drank 100 Oz of the same flavor every day for a year. I also don‚Äôt like the carbonation, but over all it is a great electrolyte.

Top tier, relyte. This one takes the cake. You can buy in bulk and it comes in tubs so it‚Äôs cheaper and you can add however much you want. Flavors are great, it has lots of salt and things like potassium and magnesium. It also uses Stevia instead of real sugar to make it more healthy. This one is AMAZING.

Saltt is pretty new to me and their flavors are hit or miss , but the good ones are really good. I love the flavor, it is REALLY salty and I can feel the difference after drinking this.

I'm freaking out because now this means there will be a wedding I'd have to attend (and all the stuff that comes with it).

I have severe agoraphobia with bladder urgency too. It's a combination of agoraphobia and claustrophobia and, as a result, I have a phobia of most things outside of the house. I'm only comfortable going out on my own and driving myself within a limited radius around my local area. The farther I go from home, the worse everything gets and I just get extreme panic and start losing my mind (DPDR?). Even if I do make it somewhere within my local area, the other difficulty is actually spending time anywhere and staying put instead of escaping and heading back home. So travel is one issue and then having to spend any length of time anywhere is another issue.

The antidepressants/anxiety meds I've tried in the past have done absolutely nothing for me, so I'm currently not on any medication. I tried requesting benzos before at the GP but they completely refused to let me try so I haven't been able to try benzos/diazepam. I'm in the UK if anyone has any advice on how I get a prescription to try diazepam/benzos.

I'm just having a total meltdown over this wedding situation. I have no idea where or when it would be. All I know is this agoraphobia has taken over my brain, body and soul - I'm so far removed and isolated from society and everything out there, an event like this is inconceivable for me with how serious my agoraphobia is. I'm living in a permanent state of chronic anxiety and adrenaline, there's just this constant buzz throughout my body which has me on the verge of a panic attack at all times.

Please I need any tips or advice for things I can start doing immediately in the wake of this news :(  Just to be clear, I go out for practice most days taking baby steps and I've had some small wins like sitting in coffee shops, but sadly a long, slow build-up like that isn't going to to help me now.",2,1745463212.0,Agoraphobia,1,1.0,False

Iv been trying to detox while still living in the mold, I sleep downstairs away from the mold but my computer room is upstairs in the mold still. The mold isn‚Äôt visible in the room but outside of my windows there is a lot of black mold on the roof and I suspect the mold is in the carpet inside my computer room.

So far iv lost 25kgs, gained some cognition back and able to work 3-4 days a week now from nothing

I just can‚Äôt seem to beat low libido (my balls have atrophied), IBS, Brain fog etc. 

Iv finally ordered a dehumidifier and air purifier for my computer room but not sure if that‚Äôs even going to help. Did it help any of you? 

My main question is what‚Äôs the best way to overcome Ochratoxin A? It seems like one of the hardest to beat. Iv tried turpentine, Iv done so many coffee enemas and 18 liver gallbladder flushes, saunas, so many other supplements but I‚Äôm still only 40% healed I think.

I‚Äôm looking into CDS/MMS and food grade hydrogen peroxide, along with HBOT and ozone therapy but far out it‚Äôs getting expensive. Iv spent atleast 60k on my health the last 2 years of being sick and it‚Äôs getting too much for me. 

What should I do? Iv been arguing with my parents to let me change rooms completely to downstairs which has no carpet and isn‚Äôt as humid but it‚Äôs been a struggle as they don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs going on.

1k6hs6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/luxsolotravel/comments/1k6hs6e/review_of_vietnam/,Review of Vietnam,"Hey Everyone, this sub has been quiet so I thought I would post a review of my recent trip to Vietnam! Feel free to ask any questions if you have them. 

Length of Trip: 2 weeks 
Time of year: Mid to Late March
Cities visited: Ho Chi Minh (Saigon), Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Hanoi

Ho Chi Minh is a super fast-paced and modern city for Vietnam, arriving here in a heat wave the city never went below 30 degrees C (90 Fahrenheit) The locals were also very friendly and the city was easy to navigate, a lot less touristy so there were far fewer store vendors trying to sell/barter. The Post office and Saigon Opera House are a bit overrated but if you have time they are lovely to see!
Favourite activity: Bui Vien Street, unmissable!! The energy was amazing, cheap drinks and the best people watching. 
Favourite bar: LeFe Rooftop bar on Bui Vien Street, the best view of the street and a quieter setting to chill out before going back down to the craziness of the street.

Hoi an: Tourist central but not in a bad way! Hoi an is set up to accomodate a huge amount of tourists who stay there or do day visits from Da Nang. Easily the most beautiful city I visited and with the best shopping! Vendors here are very pushy and everyone will be calling you into their shops so if thats not your thing I would avoid. Food and coffee here were the best basically everywhere you go.
Favourite actvitiy: Early morning tour (5:30am) of My Son and Marble Mountains with Hoi An Local Tours Company Ltd. This tour was incredible, the sites were amazing but the vehicle and small group made the expereince so much nicer + the early morning meant no lines or crowds!
Best coffee: Uncle Huan's coffee
Best cafe/cooking class: Chickpea Eatery

Da Nang: This was easily my favourite place, very modern city and has a lot of ""western comforts"". Da Nang is a great place to have in the middle of your trip  because if you miss western comforts you will find them here! The beaches were all great and the traffic was the most chill out of anywhere I went in Vietnam. Perfect place in the middle of your trip to have 3-4 relaxing beach days.
Hotel: Sofiana My Khe Hotel & Spa - highly recommend!! Lovely staff and a great spa.
Favourite food: Roots Plant-based cafe, has great raw vegan healthy deserts!
Favourite activity: Hue Imperial city Full-day tour with My Viet trip, this was a really lovely tour of Hue with some great stops along the way it was a LONG day though my tour was 11 hours.

Hanoi: Hanoi was unfortunately probably my least favourite city in Vietnam, beer street was great and there were plenty of good restaurants and stores but overall I don't think it interested me enough Plenty to do if you want to be out each night drinking and partying! The lake was beautiful and the French Quarter was lovely for morning coffee walks. From Hanoi I also did an overnight river cruise of Ha Long Bay, it is amazing but the quality of boats is hugely variable!! So be super careful when you book as sometimes when you book they use misleading photos or photos of completely different boats! 
Hotel: Mina Hotel and Spa, lovely hotel with a great rooftop! Staff were great and the location is perfect, central but not noisy. 

Overall I loved Vietnam, I am predominately vegan and it was incredibly easy for me to find vegan-friendly food everywhere I went (especially Da Nang). The locals were lovely and I found other tourists to be friendly too, no issues at all making friends at bars or on tours. I think the tailors in Hoi An are a bit overrated but buying off-the-rack silk shirts is a no-brainer there, so cheap! Hotels, restaurants and spas were all great quality at super low prices. Going in March was okay but the weather was getting cooler the further south I went, I would recommend booking in April or May for hot but still dry weather. I will go back and explore more of Vietnam! It would be very easy to stay for a month +",1,1745463045.0,luxsolotravel,0,1.0,False

1k6hpkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1k6hpkr/cross_posted_35_useless_baby_queer_in_need_of/,"(Cross posted) 35, useless baby queer in need of guidance (long text!)","Hey everyone,

I (35cisF) don‚Äôt even know where to start since I‚Äôve never posted about this online before and it‚Äôs my first experience reaching out to a community. To be honest, I feel a bit intimidated because I‚Äôm worried about all of my cultural blindspots and about how behind I am on lesbian (and more broadly queer) culture/tropes/vocabulary and of accidentally walking on toes (I understand lesbian exclusive spaces are very few and far between and it‚Äôs understandable that some people may feel very protective as a consequence).
I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure whether to ask here since I‚Äôve always felt ambivalent giving myself a hard label, especially since I have yet to have had any actual experience aside from where I‚Äôm at on a more of an intellectual level (have never had proof that I was into men romantically and they just don‚Äôt trigger anything for me physically. Happy to be friends but never felt interested in anything else).

To get the possibly most jarring fact out of the way: I‚Äôve never been with anyone in my 35 years of life out of both choice (not because of any religious belief: I‚Äôm agnostic. Just never met someone I felt anything other than friendship for.) and circumstances (had moved a lot for work, across continents and cultures, and often landing in unfavorable environments or contexts for meeting people in an unfortunate mix of cultural mismatch and challenging work-life balance). 
I have many dear and close friends of all kinds across countries though. Just no romantic interest, and the distance+them settling down with their own opposite sex partners makes it even harder to get to meet friends of friends etc since they are all either too far or no longer socializing outside of their couple life/children.
I work in the video games industry as a storyboard artist and gameplay concept artist (will likely start to look to upskill to cinematic artist sometime in the near future) with a background in animated filmmaking that I studied for during some years in Paris. Am now working in Tokyo (am well into my 3rd consecutive year in Japan).
I consider relationships and attraction on an individual level and would rather know a person for who they are not for their ‚Äúbits‚Äù. Where I‚Äôm very standard is that I‚Äôm only looking for exclusive monogamy in terms of relationship though. I‚Äôll be honest, esthetic attraction does matter to me, otherwise, I‚Äôll have trouble touching someone I don‚Äôt personally (and admittedly subjectively) find physically appealing. I‚Äôd be okay with an asexual relationship since I‚Äôm not exactly a sexual person myself. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô I‚Äôve ever learned or spoken, which tends to shock a lot of people in our highly sexualized societies. Neither proud nor ashamed about it, but it‚Äôs a fact. I‚Äôm not desperate for sex in a relationship (I‚Äôve been solitary 35 years, so it‚Äôs really not a game-changer or a big deal to me if it‚Äôs not important for my partner. Just one less thing for me to learn I guess üòÇ) but not necessarily averse either. It‚Äôs an open question kind of thing to me if I can be honest. 
emotional and intellectual are also very important to me, because I‚Äôm ideally looking for a long-term life companion, and would like to be able to envision us being a team in life, growing together side-by-side, even if we each have our own individual journeys. It‚Äôs more of a walking together towards the future more than a ‚Äòother half‚Äô kinda thing for me.
I think it‚Äôs very important for us to really understand each other, and be willing to put in the work together to show up and in order to overcome the unavoidable bumps on the road that every relationship ends up weathering. And be able to laugh.
You can tell I‚Äôm not much of a romantic already üòÇ

The way society at large operates has always more or less never managed to make me see men as desirable romantic partners in the context of a textbook heterosexual relationship (fairness and equality are very important to me. Our current cultures -although nuanced by intersectional issues that I do recognize- still benefit men more on average. Which is a big turn-off for me and a dynamic that I probably already unconsciously felt since I was a child). I think I‚Äôd be more open to women in general if we are on the same page as individuals.
Probably awkward phrasing but please bear with me: I still have no experience to base a hard stance on‚Ä¶but yeah, I can‚Äôt vibe with ‚Äúmaybe if you meet the right man‚Äù. 35 years and never even felt a single emotion for a man outside of friendly/sibling-like.
Still, feeling like it would be more about the person than the gender (if a person were to have all the attributes that I like and appreciate in a human being, I probably wouldn‚Äôt close the door just because they happen to be of a specific gender. But I feel like I may have a stronger preference for a woman, basically. Due to the way societies have shaped individuals more or less and how I personally dislike things associated with ‚Äúvirility‚Äù).
Granted, I‚Äôm not looking in a person for more than I‚Äôm bringing into the relationship myself, even in terms of the admittedly more superficial looks aspect. While the latter is not something I‚Äôm fixating on, I‚Äôd still be partial to a good hygiene and, while not necessarily athletic, someone who would still care about staying physically fit enough to be considered healthy (it‚Äôs always a plus IMO, but I‚Äôll be real: while I can walk fast and for hours on end and do enjoy hiking when the occasion shows up, go to the gym as a complete newbie, I‚Äôm also very much capable of being a lazy homebody. Unsurprisingly, given my career in art and games lol). 
Following the cliche, I‚Äôm nowhere near a fashionista: I have this terrible tendency to go for black, white or black&white casual-chic, or baggy, or even graphic oversized tees and jeans -no skirts or dresses-. I‚Äôm happy to improve my fashion sense with the right partner though, but we can be tees and jeans together too lol!! I have also never used make-up in my entire life, and tend to look more on the genderless side of things with hair that I tend to keep short, but I don‚Äôt necessarily present as butch like the awesome ladies out there. My mannerisms/presentation are also hard to define: I don‚Äôt necessarily fit into a box but I‚Äôd say somewhere between laidback, head-heavy, chill, mildly adventurous (not a fan of bugs or bungie jumping though, but am curious and like learning and trying new things and places), French-accent and deep voice, lots of sarcasm (not the mean kind except when I‚Äôm my own target) yet a short 5‚Äô2‚Äùperson, which tends to surprise my colleagues when they meet me irl after speaking in conference calls :))

One of my issues is that I am not keen on using dating apps given the impression they give me as a very transactional kind of encounter platform (nothing against them, just not my personal preference). I just feel like the process seems very curated, and makes me feel like I‚Äôd be ‚Äúshopping for people‚Äù, which is not something that I feel aligns with my style of connecting with others. Call me old-fashioned. 
I‚Äôm also not too much of a fan of having my personal info and profile out there and owned by any of those companies, if I can help it. Especially not if it‚Äôs the kind of info that I would give in the context of establishing something as private and personal as relationships.

The other thing is that I‚Äôm feeling quite isolated in Tokyo as well. Not in terms of friendships (although not wanting to be in a foreigner bubble yet also not necessarily here long term enough to learn the language sure shrinks my circles A LOT). But more in terms of values. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong: Japan is a wonderful country, with an equally excellent culture and a very mindful and generally mature society (no pun intended about the actually aging population, but I mean it about social intelligence, mindfulness in public spaces and generally responsible and respectful public behavior). I love Tokyo and its people to bits for all the objectively lovable things about them all. Of course, no place is perfect just as no person is. And Japan will always remain, as a country and its people, my favorite (hopefully to visit instead of live in). Just not somewhere I‚Äôd be able to personally thrive due to a number of factors that are personal (my lack of language ability, the distance from other industry hubs and companies and places where I‚Äôd communicate more easily, etc).
The pain point is that my impression so far is that it is a very male-centric culture (overwhelmingly heteronormative, catering more to heterosexual male desire than any other, in a very very flagrant and pervasive way, seemingly heavily internalized by women as well. Curious to know any Japanese lesbian‚Äôs opinion on this though. I can be wrong), not exactly the most open in terms of gender roles or sexuality, and also, sadly compounded by the language barrier that I knew I would contend with when I was called over for a job -I had never initially planned to come to Japan before that- (very few English speakers here, even if English is not my native language either).
Also, in the AAA game industry, especially here, I feel like it‚Äôs also an even more male-gaze, male-centric type of culture. More so in Japan than in the West, from what I could see from my personal experience. Barely any female employees in my company (I‚Äôm the only one in my department, and the only artist as well. If we don‚Äôt count the two or three married women in HR.), and I‚Äôm really not interested in the available people in my current social sphere here (nice buddies, chill people to talk to as far as I experienced. Just not attracted to the type at all).

Ideally, I wish I could continue working in my field, whether in cinema, VFX or games (worked for major industry clients from the US, one in Japan and a few in Europe) I‚Äôm actually really into story-driven cinematic -and generally more mature audience- RPGs. My dream was Larian but unfortunately for me, they already have one storyboard artist there and don‚Äôt seem to be looking for a second one to team them up with. I am open to upskilling (planing on self-learning skills required for cinematic artists), and would be more than happy to consider relocating to a place where I could put my skillset to use while also being able to find a better cultural match and community. I like meeting friends, friends of friends, socializing around coffee, meals, drinks, walks, gaming or sketching sessions (I love keeping my skills sharp and using the opportunity to get out sometimes). I probably sound like a highly social person but am actually an introvert who, while happy to socialize, to be genuine in interactions, to meet all kinds of people, and long conversations for hours on end about deep or light topics, really enjoys her alone time to recover and leave some space for creativity from time to time. Just need a healthy dose of everything. 
I speak English, French, and some Spanish (learned in high-school, so not as fluent), and I won‚Äôt mention my Japanese level because while functional, it‚Äôs barebones and not deep-convo material.

Any piece of advice as for where I should have more luck finding community and meeting more like-minded people (even friends, I‚Äôm not a one-track mind person hell-bent on just finding a partner) with whom I could vibe more given all of the above? Does anyone share the same experience or similar at this age (don‚Äôt want to dismiss the cool folks in their early 20s or younger, but age does unfortunately affect your social landscape and I‚Äôm looking for those who can relate to that, too)? 
Would be happy to read comments here from other people, whether it‚Äôs guidance, honest takes or personal experiences!

P.S: I‚Äôm a bit slow to reply or react nowadays due to project rushes and schedule overlaps, but thank you so much in advance for your time. Not taking it for granted!

P.P.S: also apologies in advance if I used any incorrect words, am coming as really clumsy (which I am) or said anything offensive, I come from a very heteronormative culture and I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a ton of blindspots in all kinds of ways. I‚Äôm willing to work on that so please feel free to call out in the comments!

I might delete this account sometime in the future (not near but just saying) just to avoid getting doxxed and my general worry of leaving too much of an online trace when it comes to personal stuff. But I‚Äôll leave the post here if it does resonate with other people in similar situations and proves helpful somewhat.

    *   **Lower Price:** Generally more affordable than genuine carafes.
    *   **Wider Availability:** Often easier to find online and in stores.

1k6hj7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1k6hj7q/should_i_stay_friends_with_person_a_because_of/,Should i stay friends with person A because of our kids?,"Background:
I grew up in a small town in East Europe where everyone knew everyone. I had siblings, bunch of cousins and my neighborhood was full of kids. I used to play wholeday, everyday outside with kids younger, older and my age. But now, I moved to big city in Florida. City where people don't know their neighbors and city full of old people. It didn't bother me until I got a kid. Now  I got 5 year old and my kid almost has no friends. My kids cousins live far away, there are no kids in the neighborhood, only time my kid plays with other kids it is at school, soccer practice, mosque and if I take my kid to park. I hate this, I want my kid to have a childhood friends or at least one chilhood friend. Most of my friends are not married, the few that are married either don't have kids or just got a little baby. None of them have 5 year old kid.

Problem:
Now, at the coffee shop I go to with my friends, i meet a person A. He overheard us talking about economy and jumped into conversation. Person A is 15 years oldet than me and he has 5 year old kid, he is kind of in same boat as me. Except, his friends have kids but they are all in high school, too old to play with his kid. So A and I,  became friends and we started doing play dates. At first I was so happy because our kids like to play with each other. He is also from East europe so that was huge plus. 

But, there is always but, lol. But A is divorced, his ex-wife has the kid every other week. Therefore when he has a kid, he wants to maximize the time with it. He wants to be a favorite parent. A takes the kid out of school early just so kid can have more play time. This is something I would never do, bydw. A also spoils his kid like crazy, giving it all the junk food his kids want, unlimited screen time, constantly buying toys and getting membership for his kid into all kids of indoor parks. A is then constantly pushing me to do the same, but there is no way.

Another thing that bothers me about person A, and I think this might be because we belong to different generations. 15 years age gape. But if I want to cancle plans with my friends, I would just txt them, saying that I can't make it. But with person A this is not possible. He would start calling me and would not stop until I pick up. When I do then he would ask me why am I canceling. Our conversation would go like this:

Person A: hey, what is going on?
Me: oh, I can't do a play date today, I am going to go play soccer with my friends.

Person A: man, forget about soccer, tell them your leg hurts, that you can't make it.
Me: nah, to late I already told them I am coming. I haven't play in a while I miss it.

Person A: soccer is stupid. You are too old to play kids sports. Our kids will never be 5 again, we should spend time with them.
Me: our kids will be 5 tomorrow, let's do play date tomorrow.

Person A: where are you leaving your kid, today when you go play soccer?
Me: at my moms, she didn't see her grandkid in forever!

Person A: you can bring your kid to my house, my kid is crying want to play with your kid, I hate when my kid cries, I cant take it. 
Me: but I already told my mom. She is excited to babysit.

Person A: i am about to put my kid on the phone, so you can her it cry. You tell it not to cry, you tell it why it can't see your kid.

As you guys can see, this is so annoying. Last time we had a play date it was at a festival and his kid got board in 10 minutes and wanted to leave. I didn't want to leave but left because person A kept begging me to listen to his kids desires. We then went to McDonald's, and person A bought us junk food from there. Then we went to some indoor park where he has membership. After 30 minutes of indoor park the kid wanted to go to Chuky Cheese. I was like: f that, I am going home. I am not following little 5 year old with no attention span commands. 

Question:
I am seriously considering telling person A not to call me anymore and that we will never do play dates again. But at same time my kid will never have a friend. Am I being selfish or is this some crazy behavior? ",1,1745462287.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

Found this subreddit and wanted to have a safe/non-judgmental space to get some ugly thoughts and feelings off my chest that I didn't feel appropriate on the other thread.  Yes, I'm being mean/petty and resentful, I know - hence I'm calling them my ugly thoughts.  
  
There's a nuance here I can't seem to verbalize.  
  
I‚Äôm frustrated there were views of having to accept someone in my life that I don't want to nor feel I should have to as a sign of maturity. It reinforces the feeling of not being seen, heard, understood or respected by my in-laws as this is what they think we should be doing as well.   
  
I feel her needs and comfort are prioritized over mine and my husband. While I agree safety is of utmost importance - I'm not heartless -¬† I truly think there are different ways to go about this problem where we all have our needs met.   
  
However, there has been no concessions, effort to try, or recognize the emotional/logistical impact it has on me and my husband.

Long and short of it is that my in-laws are taking care of my husband's ex wife and she lives with them. She's 31, and has been living with them for over a decade during the course of her relationship with my husband and post-divorce.   
  
She's clothed, fed, and housed by the generosity of his parents and she has not made any efforts to improve her life outside of hitting the gym post divorce. If she goes to therapy and they call her out, they are suddenly ""not a good fit"", when she got a job she quit within the month because she was ""bullied"" or it was too hard on her physically (or so I‚Äôm told by my husband because I don‚Äôt speak to my in-laws aside from cordial exchanges).  
  
She does not have any known impairments other than the fact that she comes from an allegedly abusive family so she does not have a home she wants to or can go back to. My husband divorced her due to the lack of any contribution to a relationship (she basically acted as a child), gas lighting, emotional manipulation, and the covert narcissistic abuse he endured. Supposedly all unintentional because she‚Äôs immature.¬†

From my perspective, she has the family wrapped around her finger by playing victim and has unintentionally turned his parents against him. Basically everything she does is painted in a good light because of how ""helpless"" she is and somehow twists what he does as inappropriate or ‚Äúbad‚Äù because he should know better coming from a safe family, and now by extension, me as well.

During their divorce, and well after he started a relationship with me (6 months in) they still pushed him to talk to her, be friends, and comfort her when she's upset or say on his behalf that he still cares as a friend.  When she throws a fit, starts crying, they all rush in to comfort her and force him to take her out for coffee, be cordial and ""mature"" etc. He did this at the beginning of our relationship until I put my foot down on how inappropriate it is when I found out. 

Long and short of it, I don't think it's wrong of me or my husband; who wants to move on with his life, to not be reminded of his past if he's trying to be with his family, nor have to accept her as part of our lives simply because his parents see her as an adoptive daughter. 

He has an ex-wife, not a child.  
  
That chapter has closed and we want to move on.   
  
I'm tired of the fact that they can‚Äôt understand that she‚Äôs not **just** their pseudo-daughter. She has a past with their son and involving her in every single daily activity with the family, holidays and being in their home does not give space for my husband to move on, nor for me to feel that I have a role in the family or accepted as the wife if someone is already being treated as such. I'm not trying to replace her, simply be accepted as a new family member and redefine boundaries.

It irks me because family is important to me and I have dreamed of having a close relationship with my in-laws.  
  
Her role and place in the family has not been redefined for me to feel like I have that space. I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm being super pick me or petty - again, not trying to say the parents need to cut all ties, but simply help her grow, move on, and give space for their son (and I) to be part of their lives in parallel vs. forcing us to all get along.¬†

The lack of effort for them to acknowledge or understand us makes me feel like an outsider, and them calling us childish for not being able to be friends while praising how amazing she is for wanting to be friends (well duh her livelihood is dependent on keeping them happy to stay there!) makes me resentful.

Thank you for letting me vent.

All communication with the inlaws has been through my husband, it's his problem to solve, his baggage to clear up, but I can't help but feel like collateral damage.

correct me if i'm wrong (which i probably am) but the whole point of it was that even though Blaine left Dalton he still has an attachment to The Warblers and they supposedly don't have anywhere else to go but realistically, is there not another school in Westerville they can go to?

let's say the warblers had to go to McKinley high everyday for real classes and not just for glee club practices. all of them would have to travel about 1 hour and 30 minutes to Lima for a 6/7 hour school day then back to Westerville which would be another 1 hour and 30 minutes and they'd have to do that 5 days a week

i *know* it's not that deep and it's just a tv show but it's one of the many inconsistencies/plot holes in the show and out of all of them it's the most confusing one in my opinion but again it's kinda been awhile since i watched the show so i could be remembering it all wrong 

and another thing which is kinda unrelated, the Lima bean is in Lima which once again, Lima is 1 hour and 30 minutes away from Westerville so why are some of The Warblers (well technically just Sebastian) always showing up there? why is he taking an hour an a half long trip just to get coffee? are there not any coffee shops in Westerville? how is he getting there? like i've said it's been awhile since i watched the show but as far as i can remember he never talked about having a car so is he just magically teleporting there or what?

Either way my bowels have never been the same since. Pebble poops and I‚Äôd only go every 3-4 days. Even when I‚Äôd go daily, still pebble poops. I think after awhile I just accepted it although it has always bothered me. I‚Äôve tried drinking more water, adding fiber, magnesium, prune juice, senna tea, probiotics, gut motility supplements, etc,. Either it just didn‚Äôt work, or it made really gassy or bloated, or it would trigger motility, but still be pebble poops. The senna tea gave me cramps and diarrhea, so I wouldn‚Äôt call that a fix at all either. Anyway, fast forward to this pregnancy and I was taking a stool softener daily, Seed probiotics, magnesium citrate and electrolytes and still the same old same old. Well, I kept hearing/reading about Miralax working for some people (especially in pregnancy forums) and I was coming to the conclusion that what I was doing wasn‚Äôt working.

1k6h38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1k6h38p/through_the_unicorns_looking_glass_mike_resnicks/,Through the Unicorn's Looking Glass: Mike Resnick's John Justin Mallory and the Evolution of Urban Fantasy Noir,"In a literary landscape where worlds collide and reality bends, few series have captured the delightful absurdity of urban fantasy quite like Mike Resnick's chronicles of John Justin Mallory. Beginning in the late 1980s and spanning over two decades, these tales follow a hard-boiled detective from our mundane Manhattan who finds himself navigating an alternate New York where magic rules, mythological creatures roam freely, and the laws of physics take frequent coffee breaks. Through Mallory's journey, Resnick crafted a masterclass in genre-blending storytelling that combines film noir aesthetics with fantasy adventure and wry humor.
The Origin Story: ""Stalking the Unicorn"" (1987)
The journey begins on a cold New Year's Eve in 1987 with the publication of ""Stalking the Unicorn: A Fable of Tonight."" Mallory, a down-on-his-luck detective whose partner has absconded with his wife and their agency's funds, finds himself approached by M√ºrgenst√ºrm, a small elf with an unusual case. The elf has lost a unicorn entrusted to his care, and if it isn't recovered by dawn, M√ºrgenst√ºrm will face a fate worse than death. With nothing better to do and desperately needing the money, Mallory accepts the case, only to be drawn into a parallel Manhattan filled with fantastical creatures and peculiar rules.
What makes ""Stalking the Unicorn"" so captivating is Resnick's commitment to maintaining Mallory's hard-boiled detective persona against an increasingly bizarre backdrop. Mallory approaches this strange world with the same methodical investigation techniques and dry wit he would use for any other case. His first-person narration maintains the clipped cadence and world-weary perspective of classic noir, creating a delightful friction against the fantasy setting.
The book introduces many characters who would become series mainstays: Winnifred Carruthers, a middle-aged woman with extensive knowledge of the magical Manhattan; Felina, a cat-girl who becomes inexplicably attached to Mallory; and the Grundy, the kingpin of magical Manhattan's criminal underworld and Mallory's nemesis throughout the series.
After its publication, fans had to wait over two decades for Mallory's next adventure, but the foundation was laid for what would become a cult classic series.
The Long-Awaited Return: ""Stalking the Vampire"" (2008)
Twenty-one years passed before Resnick returned to Mallory's world with ""Stalking the Vampire: A Fable of Tonight,"" published in 2008. This gap between publications gives the series a fascinating meta-narrative quality‚Äîwhile only a year has passed in Mallory's world, the real world had seen massive changes in urban fantasy literature, with the genre growing exponentially in popularity.
The sequel finds Mallory now established as a detective in the magical Manhattan, having decided to stay after the events of the first book. When his partner Winnifred Carruthers appears with two puncture wounds on her neck, Mallory begins investigating her nephew, who appears to have become a vampire. The case leads him through magical Manhattan's vampire community, revealing new dimensions of this parallel world.
Resnick's writing in this second installment shows a confidence and playfulness that comes from returning to a beloved world. The tone remains consistent with the first book, but the worldbuilding expands significantly. We see more of magical Manhattan's neighborhoods, political structures, and social dynamics. The Grundy returns as a villain, though in more complex ways than before, and Felina continues to be Mallory's loyal if somewhat puzzling companion.
What's particularly notable in ""Stalking the Vampire"" is how Resnick pokes gentle fun at the vampire fiction boom that had occurred in the years between his first and second Mallory books. His vampires adhere to some traditional tropes while subverting others, maintaining the series' approach of using fantasy elements to both honor and satirize genre conventions.
The Trilogy Expands: ""Stalking the Dragon"" (2009)
Riding the momentum of the series' revival, Resnick published ""Stalking the Dragon: A Fable of Tonight"" just a year later in 2009. This time, Mallory takes on a case involving a missing pet‚Äîa prize-winning dragon the size of a Chihuahua that's been stolen before the big Eastminster pet show. The case leads Mallory through magical Manhattan's elite social circles and seedy underground, revealing yet more facets of this bizarre mirror world.
By this third installment, the series formula had been well-established: Mallory takes a case that seems straightforward but quickly becomes complicated by the magical elements of his adopted world. He relies on his pragmatic detective skills while navigating increasingly absurd scenarios, maintaining his deadpan demeanor throughout.
""Stalking the Dragon"" deepens the characterization of the supporting cast. Winnifred shows more of her past and her adaptation to working with Mallory, while Felina's attachment to Mallory develops in unexpected ways. The Grundy's role in magical Manhattan becomes more nuanced, revealing the complex ecosystem of power in this alternate reality.
Resnick's worldbuilding grows more ambitious here, introducing concepts like pet shows for magical creatures and the social hierarchies among different fantasy species. The humor becomes more self-assured as well, with Resnick finding the perfect balance between noir mystery and fantasy comedy.
Expanding the Universe: The Mallory Short Stories
Between and after the novels, Resnick expanded Mallory's world through several short stories that appeared in various anthologies and magazines. Stories like ""The Chinese Sandman"" (2002), ""Card Shark"" (2008), ""Stalking the Zombie"" (2012), and others allowed Resnick to explore smaller cases and character moments that wouldn't sustain full novels.
These short stories showcase Resnick's versatility with the character and setting. Some lean more heavily into the comedy aspects, others emphasize the noir mystery elements, but all maintain the distinctive voice and worldview that make Mallory such an enduring character.
The short stories also allowed Resnick to collaborate with other writers. ""The Long and Short of It"" (2012), co-written with Jody Lynn Nye, brings Mallory into contact with other detectives from magical Manhattan, highlighting how his ""mundane world"" approach differs from those who grew up in this fantastical realm.
By this point, Mallory had evolved from a fish-out-of-water protagonist to something of an institution in magical Manhattan‚Äîstill an outsider in many ways, but respected for his unique approach to solving the realm's problems. His relationships with Winnifred and Felina had deepened, and even his antagonistic dynamic with the Grundy had developed nuances.
Resnick's passing in 2020 means the Mallory series is now complete, giving it a distinct beginning, middle, and end‚Äîsomething increasingly rare in fantasy literature, where series often extend indefinitely. The four novels and handful of short stories provide a complete arc for the character and his world, while leaving enough unexplored territory that readers can imagine Mallory continuing his investigations.
A Genre-Defining Series
Looking at the Mallory series as a whole reveals Resnick's significant contribution to urban fantasy. Though the first book predates what we now consider the urban fantasy boom, it contains many elements that would become staples of the genre: the collision of mundane and magical worlds, the noir-influenced protagonist, the alternate version of a familiar city, and the mixture of mystery plotting with fantastical elements.
What sets the Mallory books apart, even decades after they began, is their distinctive tone. Where many urban fantasy series opt for gritty darkness or epic scale, Resnick maintained a perfect balance of hardboiled detective fiction, fantasy adventure, and gentle satire. Mallory never loses his pragmatic approach or his dry wit, no matter how bizarre his surroundings become.
The series also stands out for its willingness to embrace the absurd. While many urban fantasy authors strive to make their magical elements seem plausible or internally consistent, Resnick revels in the inherent silliness of concepts like demon-possessed subway trains or unicorns running numbers rackets. Yet this absurdity never undermines the genuine mysteries at the heart of each story or the authentic human connections between characters.
Through the Looking Glass
There's something wonderfully meta about the Mallory series when viewed across its full publication timeline. Beginning before urban fantasy was a recognized genre, going dormant during its rise to prominence, and then returning when the genre had become established, the series serves as both a forerunner and a commentary on urban fantasy's evolution.
Mallory himself undergoes a parallel journey‚Äîfrom a man out of place in a world he doesn't understand to someone who has found a niche in that world while maintaining his original identity. He never fully acclimates to magical Manhattan's strangeness, and that's the point. His outsider perspective is precisely what makes him valuable in this world, just as Resnick's distinctive approach to urban fantasy set his work apart from the crowd.
In the end, John Justin Mallory's adventures remain a unique landmark in fantasy literature‚Äîa perfect cocktail of noir mystery, fantasy worldbuilding, and humor that continues to delight readers. Through his looking glass of unicorns, vampires, dragons, and cat-girls, we see not just a distorted reflection of our world, but a perspective on genre fiction that remains as fresh and engaging today as when Mallory first crossed the threshold between worlds on that fateful New Year's Eve.
