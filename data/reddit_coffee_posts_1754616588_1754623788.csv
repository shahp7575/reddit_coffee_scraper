So, after said coffee I hung out with a friend, and around 3 hours later my head began to hurt. I thought of the usual suspects first – being a little hungry, not drinking enough water, just plain talking too much – and didn't worry too much about it. 

I also take medication before every meal due to IBS, and I got distracted when I was about to take it and totally blanked on whether I had taken the pill or not, but took one anyway. 

Then I ate, which made my headache better for a few minutes before it got worse, and then I felt a stomachache followed by nausea and some light chills. I kneeled in front of the toilet in case I may puke and sat there for a bit until I felt a bit better. Then eventually I felt well, headache gone and everything. 

I'm not sure what happened – if it was the caffeine, if it accidentally took 2 pills, if the food didn't sit well with me – but the whole ordeal lasted about 20 minutes, from feeling sick to getting much better. 

Besides being a hypochondriac, I'm also tokophobic, so random nausea is particularly scary to me. I take the combination pill and I just had my withdrawal bleed this weekend which had put me at ease. And now, I don't even want to say I'm concerned about anything because I honestly don't even want to think about it as a possibility (which would just be very very low regardless, – almost impossible – thankfully.)

So yeah, this is what is keeping me restless this time. Anybody ever experienced something like this? A random, very sickly feeling that resolved itself quickly?",1,1754623685.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1mkkjq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mkkjq2/running_out_of_alternatives/,Running out of alternatives,"I've come to the conclusion that I'm autistic and nobody ever bothered to tell me. I've spent my whole adult life seeing therapists who told me I was fine, meanwhile everything in my environment informed that I was not fine. I was told that it's all in my head, when it's now obvious to me all the signs I saw were there. People treat me differently, they talk to me like I'm stupid, they keep secrets from me, they talk about me behind my back and when I call them on the carpet they make me into the bad guy. My job is to suffer at the expense of others, to be their joke, their clown, their perfect idiot. And if I don't like that? Too fucking bad, I guess. I don't get to have opinions, I don't get to have feelings, those aren't for me. But there's nothing wrong with me, nooooo, not a thing. That's what they say. They say that over and over and over again and that's all they've ever said to me since I was a child, meanwhile they treat me me like a disease. So I just told myself: let it go, let it go, don't let it get to you. And that worked for awhile. But the problem is other people. They want me to feel the shame. They want me to feel the pain of their judgement. This is my punishment for being different. But I'm not different. There's nothing wrong with me. They tell me there's nothing wrong with me. But they treat me like there's something wrong with me. What the fuck is this? This is torture. Slow, excruciating torture. And I'm just supposed to be okay with it.

I'm starting a new job next week that I know I'm going to be bad at. I can't find any work in my field after losing the job I had for almost three years and then quitting the job I went to after that because I could tell all my coworkers were shitting on me behind my back and spreading rumors about me. People are going to tell me that I'm crazy, that I'm being paranoid, but I fucking SEE THIS SHIT IN LIVING FUCKING COLOR EVERY GODDAMN DAY AND I KNOW WHAT I AM SEEING AND I KNOW THAT ITS FUCKING REAL. I would love to be proven wrong, I have held out hope to be proven wrong. But nobody is proving me wrong. 

  
I am falling apart. I am dying. I am going to kill myself. I just need to work up the nerve. I'm scared of a world where I fall asleep and never wake up. I cling to these small things like having a cup of coffee or watching the sunset, but my enjoyment of these things is stolen from me when I realize I've been a fool my entire life. All the years I wasted believing the lie that I'm normal, that other people's avoidance of me was just a coincidence or in my head. Then suddenly these things I enjoy don't seem so enjoyable anymore. They're the simple pleasures of a simpleton, the village idiot.

I'm completely leaving out all the stuff about drugs and alcohol because that would just make this even longer. But I'll say this much -- all I want, all I have ever wanted to do is get fucked up as much as possible. My liver aches on most days and I know that's not in my head either. So I'm an addict on top of all that. I can't even be a boy scout right. I can't do anything right.

I've fucked my life up. Me piloting my body has been like a toddler trying to drive a bus. I have crashed it at every turn and probably hurt a few people along the way but I'm such a moron with zero awareness that I didn't even register it.

They want me dead. I want me dead, too. I'm not gonna say how old I am, but I'm old enough. Old enough to know better. Old enough to figure out when something isn't working. None of this is working. Nothing I do works. I get these hollow words of affirmation that feel like should help but they don't. I'm running out of places to turn. I'm running out of money. Everyone is laughing at me. They're all in on this. It's a secret. Don't tell him. He's an idiot, he wouldn't get it anyway. Just smile and nod. He'll tire himself out eventually. 

I hate you all so fucking much. All of you. I don't want to do this anymore. I wish you'd just take care of it yourselves, but I gotta be the one that does it. Laugh it up. Screenshot this and post it in a 4chan cringe thread. Hopefully someone will get some entertainment out of the absolute joke that has been my life. Allow me to reiterate: I hate you all. I wish you the best. Thanks. ",1,1754623595.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

The young explorer became lost within the dense fog, forcing him to take a trail path that led to the cabin. Once inside the young explorer discovered the amulet on a coffee table covered in dust.

Once dusted the amulet began to glow in a ferocious manner and a blast of energy came from the amulet. The cabin, the reporters, the scientists, the townsfolk's; they had all disappeared.

Any problem I bring up both work or personal he takes it upon himself to find a solution. I was having electrical problems at my house and he took it upon himself to hire someone and paid for it. Around $5000. We talk about our spouses but never anything bad. I have never been treated so well and I’m so confused.

If lets say my friend's neighbor has home-based business of deep fried dishes. He has some complaints but did not want to confront directly.

Complain such as:

1. The air is ""oily"" , some more the HBB open his door which allows the oily air to be spread around.

Not to forget the smell of fried chicken lingering.

2. How about pests ? this definitely ""house warming"" for pests

3. With many recent cases of fire burndown houses, this is definitely higher risk activities done by the neighbor. In fact, HDB Fire insurance premiums should be rocketed if you have higher risk neighbor

4. Rider/Customer picking up food footfalls are kinda disturbing. Now my friend have to close their door , no choice.

We support HBB, but shouldn't it be more regulated ? and if the neighbor have such issue where can he complain? like my friend is cool if its like coffee/beverage. But Deep Fried dishes? bruh....prices also comparable to hawker",5,1754622792.0,SingaporeRaw,2,1.0,False

1mkk61u,https://www.reddit.com/r/femaletravels/comments/1mkk61u/3_days_in_santa_barbara_that_felt_like_a_reset/,3 Days in Santa Barbara That Felt Like a Reset Button,"I just got back from a solo trip to Santa Barbara and wanted to share what I did in case anyone else is planning a little beach escape. I’ve been trying to do more short getaways that feel chill and recharging without being boring and Santa Barbara was perfect for that. It’s walkable, cute, not overwhelming, and has that kind of slow-luxury vibe without needing to do much planning.

Here’s a quick idea of how I structured my 3 days (I also made a mapped version with all the pins if you want to use it, linked below).

**Day 1:** I stayed at the Hotel Californian which was a little splurge but totally worth it. Right between the Funk Zone and the beach so I could just walk everywhere. I did a little sunset walk to Stearns Wharf, grabbed wine and fish tacos, and just kind of eased into the trip.

**Day 2:** Wine tour day Santa Ynez Valley. Honestly one of the prettiest drives I’ve ever done. It felt safe and relaxed doing it solo since it was a group tour. I came back super zen, grabbed a late lunch at Brophy Bros. by the harbor, and later treated myself to a massage at FLOAT Spa. 10/10 recommend.

**Day 3:** Woke up early and walked Butterfly Beach with coffee in hand, then had brunch at Boathouse (the views!!). Walked around downtown a bit more, stopped at La Arcada Plaza to poke around shops and galleries. I had a few hours to kill before heading out so I just chilled in the Mission Rose Garden with a book. It was the perfect slow sendoff.

A few random tips if you’re going solo:

* You honestly don’t need a car if you stay near downtown or the Funk Zone.
* The pace is slow  in a good way. No pressure to over-schedule.
* It felt safe the whole time, even walking alone during sunset.
* Lots of chill moments built in  spa time, beach, cafes with outdoor seating, wine tasting with new people if you want social energy without committing.

Anyway, I’ve been sharing a few of my solo getaways lately, past and future and I put them into little 3-day mapped guides. They’re kind of like a shortcut if you want to skip the planning part but still have a stylish, easy trip.

Here’s the one I made for Santa Barbara if anyone wants it:

Just something I put together for my travel newsletter. I send out a new one each week with different destinations, mostly weekend-type trips that are perfect for solo resets or girls’ weekends. If you like this vibe, feel free to follow along. I just like sharing what works for me in case it helps someone else. 💛

1mkk4hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mkk4hd/conversation_with_a_therapist/,Conversation With A Therapist,"Delilah sat on the dark blue couch, nervously playing with her blonde hair. Her tired blue eyes stared at the woman in front of her. Doctor Blackwell smiled warmly at her, trying her best to make her feel more at ease. A brown coffee table sat between them with a small flowerpot being home to a little pink orchid, a small photo of the Doctor and what looked like her husband resting next to it. He seemed familiar somehow, but she wasn’t sure where she had seen him before. Degrees and certificates hung in their golden frames on the wall next to a small clock. Delilah tried her best to feel comfortable in the bland room. A lover of all things colorful (although not lately) she silently cringed at the plain cream wallpaper and lack of decoration. Her eyes landed on a small circular camera almost hidden in the corner of the room.  

 “It's so nice to finally meet you, Delilah. My name is Doctor Blackwell but you’re more than welcome to address me as Dr. B” she said, her smile never fading the whole time. Delilah sat up a little and cleared her throat.  

“Hi” she simply said.  

 Doctor Blackwell was accustomed to this. All of her patients were timid at first and she couldn’t really blame them. After all, she did specialize with those who experienced severe trauma. Disassociation and unwillingness to communicate, especially with a therapist, was a common response. For now, she would mostly be trying to gain Delilah’s trust. Although it was, in Doctor Blackwell’s opinion, a very important field, there were less and less people in need of her expert services. But this was her true passion and the only career suitable for her. Doctor Blackwell shifted in her seat, getting comfortable. She reached down into her brown purse that was sitting by her feet and pulled out a notebook and pen, clicking it twice.  

 “I just wanted to say that for today, we can talk about whatever you want. We don’t have to discuss anything that you don’t want to. We can talk about what movies or music you like, or if you like you can ask me as many questions as you want” Doctor Blackwell rambled, setting aside the notebook momentarily. Delilah perked up a little, a small smile reluctantly crept its way onto her face. “Okay. Can I think about what to ask first?” she asked politely. Doctor Blackwell nodded and smiled back at her.  

 Delilah leaned back on the couch, her observant eyes scanning the doctor in front of her. Doctor Blackwell sat back, letting her take her time but was slightly caught off guard by how piercing Delilah’s gaze was.  

 Delilah had always been observant and curious by nature. She knew that Dr. B was only trying to gain her trust, but she decided that maybe trusting someone wouldn’t be so bad, especially after what she had gone through.  

 “What’s your favorite color?” she finally asked. “I like pink. I know it doesn’t seem like it with how my office is, but every office was designed to look the same. I got away with the pink orchid though” Dr. B replied, nodding at the flower. Delilah smiled a little. “Me too,” the girl said.  

 “What’s your favorite movie?” Delilah questioned again. Dr. B quickly answered, “Definitely the Babadook”. Delilah let out a small laugh and added “The Babadook is such a standard therapist answer. There are so many other movies that have shit about grief and mental illness in them that are better”.  

 Doctor Blackwell chuckled, glad that Delilah was relaxing. “Okay, okay, fine you got me. I see that you are also a horror movie fan. I love classic horror movies like The Shining. Truthfully, my husband is the real horror connoisseur. He has a small platform where he posts everything horror. Is that answer more acceptable to you?” she inquired playfully. Delilah sat back and laughed again. “Yes, much better. I love horror movies too. I think I may have seen a few of your husbands' posts. I appreciate you being honest with me, Dr B. If you answer things honestly then so will I.”  

 Slightly taken aback by her candor, Doctor Blackwell picked up her notebook again and nodded. “Deal” she said. “Do you have anything else you want to ask me?”.  

 Delilah nodded back at her. “What made you decide to become a therapist?” she asked with an innocent bat of her long lashes. Dr. B smiled, seemingly used to getting asked this question. “Well, I always knew that I wanted to be in a career that allowed me to help people.” She replied. “My mother had her own struggles with mental illness which definitely emphasized the importance of this field to me” Dr. B added after hesitating slightly. Delilah frowned a little. “I’m sorry to hear that”. Her gaze sharpened a little, resting on Dr. B as if trying to guess her answer to the next question. “Have you had many patients like me before?”.  

 “Yes, I have actually if what you mean is if I’ve treated young women before”. Doctor Blackwell stated, quickly trying to determine if Delilah was ready to open up about herself now. “I’ve found that having a fellow female to talk to is much easier,” Doctor Blackwell added.  

 Delilah tilted her head up slightly. “How so?” she wondered out loud. “Well, women can often empathize with each other's situations in deeper ways as well as creating a more… safe atmosphere which is important to those who have experienced trauma” Doctor Blackwell explained patiently. “I think your situation also calls for a female therapist since I believe you might have some trauma with men” she continued.  

 Delilah paused and looked at Dr. B, her eyes staring at her in confusion. “Why would you think that?” Delilah asked aggressively, as if she was uncomfortable with how Dr. B was talking about the incident so blatantly. As if she didn’t want anyone to know the details of what happened.  

 Doctor Blackwell shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “Well Delilah, you witnessed a man doing something horrible to your classmates. I can’t even imagine what that must have been like. The powerlessness you must have felt in that moment is something you never should have experienced.”  

 “Watching someone fucking murder my friends is something I never should have experienced” Delilah interrupted. “Of course I was powerless. What was I supposed to do? I couldn’t have done anything”. Delilah folded her arms across her chest and glared at Dr. B. “The police keep asking me question after question as if I could have done something. As if I stood a chance against a psycho with an axe. I don’t know how I was the only one to survive that day in the library, but the point is I did, and I think this whole thing is just useless”. Delilah angrily rolled her eyes and looked away.  

 Doctor Blackwell took a deep breath, thinking about what to say next. She wrote down “seemingly powerless” in her notebook, although her little outburst suggested otherwise. “I’m sorry if I upset you, Delilah. Do you ever feel guilty… about surviving?"" Doctor Blackwell asked hesitantly.  

 Delilah looked away from Dr. B, choosing to settle on the pink orchid instead. She sat there for a moment, unmoving and silent; refusing to meet the doctors' suspicious eyes. After a few minutes, she finally spoke. “No” she said in a voice that was barely even a whisper. “I don’t. I hid and didn’t get caught. They did. I’m living with the trauma and they’re all comfortable in little cushioned coffins. Their families and friends come by every day to see them. You know who visits me? Police detectives who think a high school senior is gonna be the key to solving which pathetic little low life has been chopping up kids.” Delilah spat out, her blue eyes starting to tear up.  

 Doctor Blackwell looked at her, her expression unreadable, unfazed by Delilah’s harsh words. But not surprised. She stared down at her notebook, trying to recall anything from her experience that she could use to help the girl in front of her. Whether it was helping her with the grieving process or helping her confess to something, she wasn’t sure.  

 Doctor Blackwell looked up at her cautiously, pondering the next question she had in the back of her mind since the teenager first sat down in front of her. “Do you think... the police are suspicious of you?” The words had barely left her lips before Delilah’s head snapped up at Doctor Blackwell. The doctor momentarily sank back into her chair, cringing when she let a gasp escape. Delilah didn’t know what to do except glare menacingly at Dr. B. Did she know what was going on? Was she onto her?  

 Delilah remained silent for longer this time, calculating eyes never leaving the woman in front of her. Dr. B, clearly feeling her piercing gaze sat up straight and silent, her eyes showing evident distress as every possible response ran through her head. The two women sat silently, allowing the ticking sound of the clock to be the only noise in the room. Delilah sank further into the soft couch as if she was daring Dr. B to break the silence. Delilah hated to admit it even to herself, but Dr. B was a smart woman. Surely, she would know what was going on by now.  

 Doctor Blackwell took in a long, deep breath before letting the shaky sound of her exhale out. “Delilah” Doctor Blackwell said, trying to sound comforting. “I’m sorry for asking you these questions. As I said earlier, I can’t imagine what it must have been like for you. Hiding in that cabinet... you must have been so terrified, and you might be feeling even more stress what with all the officers asking you hard questions”. Doctor Blackwell tried her best to remain calm, but her facade was quickly slipping away. She couldn’t shake away the feeling that Delilah knew.  

 Delilah cocked her head to the side. Her confidence dropped for just a moment, letting her brows furrow in confusion. “I never said I was hiding in a cabinet. I never even told the police that...” Delilah uttered breathlessly, the pieces finally connecting. Dr. B’s husband wasn’t familiar to her from social media. He was the man she saw that day in the library. He was the man she saw gruesomely murder her friends. He was the man who stared directly at her hiding spot and flashed her a smile that had been haunting her every night. A smile that made her sick just from thinking about it.  

 Doctor Blackwell’s eyes darted from the photo on the table to Delilah’s nauseous face. She had a feeling Delilah would have recognized him. Doctor Blackwell sighed and shook her head. “It's just so hard to find new patients these days” Doctor Blackwell muttered and stood up, reaching down into her purse. Delilah stood up in a panic, desperately eyeing the security camera on the wall.  

 Noticing this, Dr. B chuckled a little. “It doesn’t work, dear. It’s just there for show” the doctor said as she pulled out a small bottle from her purse. Delilah gasped and tried to run but Dr. B kicked the coffee table which smashed into her knees, hard. Delilah fell to the ground but tried to crawl away from the woman advancing on her.  

 “I’m sorry dear, but this would be easier if you just didn’t struggle” Dr. B said with a menacing smile. Before Delilah could react, Dr. B pounced on her and pulled her shirt up to cover her face. Delilah tried to scream but then felt the doctor pouring the liquid from the bottle over her shirt. Delilah struggled feebly for what felt like hours, but her limbs soon became limp; her hand covered in the dirt from the overturned flowerpot.  

 Doctor Blackwell sighed. Transporting them was the hard part.  

 After a few hours, Delilah woke up to find herself tied to a beam in what looked like a basement. She tried to take in her surroundings but her throbbing head made that difficult. All she could make out was the dirt floor and a heavy looking door that stood at the end of a wooden staircase. She closed her eyes and tilted her head back, silent tears slipping down her face. What was she going to do now? Suddenly she could hear two voices beyond the door. She tried to inch forward but her chest was tied tightly to the beam. Opting to stay as quiet as possible, she finally heard Dr. B arguing with someone. “You just had to look right at her didn’t you” the doctor’s muffled voice said. A much deeper voice that sounded just as annoyed replied with “Well maybe you shouldn’t have had my fucking photo out in the first place”.  

 Delilah tried to listen in more, but her heart felt like it had stopped beating when she heard Dr. B say, “It doesn’t matter now, we have to get rid of her too”. Delilah desperately tugged and squirmed against the harsh ropes, praying for them to go loose. But they remained tight as ever, digging into her skin and drawing blood. Delilah let out a sharp cry at the sudden pain and instantly regretted it. Her eyes quickly found the door again and she hoped with every fiber of her being that they didn’t hear her. Luck was not on her side as heavy footsteps quickly found their way to the door that was now being swung open.  

 A man stood in the doorway, large axe in hand. His shaggy black hair barely covering his menacing dark eyes. He just stared at her for a moment, a twisted smile creeping onto his face. He tightened the axe in his grip and walked towards her. Bending down to look at Delilah’s tear-soaked face, he took her chin in between his fingers. “Couldn’t have just looked the other way huh” he spat out. He stood up and took a step back, raising the axe above his head.  

 “Stop!! Wait no please!!” Delilah desperately cried out, heels digging fervently into the dirt as she tried to scramble away in vain. The last thing she saw was the axe coming down directly aimed at her skull. Her limbs went limp once again, permanently this time. Red blood streamed down her face, coating her once blonde hair.  

 A shallow grave had already been prepared for her in the corner of the basement. Delilah, or any of the other girls buried there would unfortunately not be getting their own cushioned coffins. Her body fell into the hole with a loud thump. Doctor Blackwell and her husband took their time covering her with dirt until it looked like nobody was buried there at all. Like it was really just a normal basement with no skeletons rotting beneath them.  

 “We’ll be more careful next time” Doctor Blackwell told her husband softly.

# Naked Filter Review 2025: Find Your Best Option Now!

A Naked filter, also known as a bottomless portafilter, is a specialized coffee brewing tool that exposes the bottom of the coffee puck during the extraction process. This allows for a clear view of the espresso shot as its being pulled, providing valuable feedback on the grind, tamping, and overall extraction quality. For baristas and coffee enthusiasts alike, it's an indispensable tool for perfecting their espresso skills and troubleshooting potential issues.

The use of naked filters is not merely aesthetic; it's deeply rooted in the pursuit of coffee perfection. By visually analyzing the extraction, users can identify channeling, squirting, and other inconsistencies that can negatively impact the taste and quality of the espresso. This direct feedback loop enables baristas to make real-time adjustments and refine their technique for optimal results. Choosing the right naked filter is a crucial step in achieving consistently excellent espresso shots.

## Key Features Analysis

The world of naked filters boasts a range of features tailored to diverse needs and preferences. This section delves into the critical aspects, from build materials to compatibility and portafilter size, to help you navigate the available options.

**Material Construction**

Naked filters are typically made from stainless steel, offering durability and resistance to corrosion. The specific grade of stainless steel can vary, with higher grades such as 304 stainless steel being more resistant to rust and pitting. Some filters may also feature wooden or plastic handles, with ergonomic designs for agreeable handling. For professional use, the stainless steel needs to be of sufficient thickness to withstand daily use.

**Portafilter Basket Compatibility**

Most naked filters are designed to accept standard 58mm portafilter baskets, allowing users to swap out baskets to experiment with different coffee volumes and extraction profiles. Though, it's essential to verify compatibility with your existing baskets before purchasing a naked filter. Some models may also come with a specialized basket designed to optimize extraction when used with the naked filter.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics**

The handle of a naked filter plays a crucial role in comfort and ease of use. Ergonomic designs with contoured shapes and comfortable grips can reduce strain and fatigue during repeated use. The material of the handle, such as wood or plastic, also contributes to the overall feel and durability of the portafilter. A well-designed handle should provide a secure and comfortable grip, even with wet hands.

**Spoutless Design and Visual Feedback**

The key feature of a naked filter is its spoutless design, wich allows for a direct view of the espresso extraction. This provides crucial visual feedback on the grind, tamping, and overall extraction quality. By observing the color, flow, and consistency of the espresso as it's being pulled, users can identify channeling, squirting, and other inconsistencies that can negatively impact the taste and quality of the espresso.Key features of high-quality naked filters include:

* Durable stainless steel construction
* Compatibility with standard 58mm portafilter baskets
* Ergonomic handle design
* Direct visual feedback of the espresso extraction

## core Benefits

The use of a naked filter extends beyond mere aesthetics, providing concrete benefits that impact both the quality of espresso and the barista's workflow.

**Improved Extraction Analysis**

A Naked filter provides invaluable visual feedback, allowing baristas to diagnose and correct extraction issues in real time. By observing the espresso flow, you can easily identify channeling, squirting, or uneven extraction, indicating grind size or tamping inconsistent issues. Addressing these issues leads to more consistent and flavorful espresso shots.

**Enhanced crema Production**

The open design of a naked filter promotes greater crema production compared to spouted portafilters. By allowing the espresso to flow directly into the cup, the naked filter reduces the disruption of the crema layer, resulting in a richer and more voluminous crema. This is visually appealing and contributes to the overall mouthfeel and flavor of the espresso.

**Refined Brewing Technique**

Using a naked filter encourages better brewing technique. The visual feedback promptly penalizes poor tamping and uneven distribution through visible spurting, making the barista more aware of any inconsistencies. Over time, this promotes a consistent and repeatable workflow, improving consistency and reducing wasted coffee.**Diagnostic Tool for Grinder Performance**

Variations in the stream appearance from shot to shot can identify issues with the grinder itself. Erratic extractions, even with consistent tamping, can suggest burrs or other components needing attention. This transforms the naked filter into a diagnostic tool, not just a brewing tool.

**Efficiency and Cleanliness**

Some users report that using a naked filter can lead to a slightly cleaner workflow, as there are no spouts for coffee to linger in. This can marginally make cleaning easier, and potentially reduce any stale coffee affecting flavor over time.

## FAQs section

Users often have questions about the practicalities of using naked filters, ranging from espresso machine compatibility to cleaning and maintenance. Here are some common questions addressing common concerns.**Will This Naked Filter Fit My Espresso Machine?**

Compatibility is the most common concern.Most naked filters are designed to fit standard 58mm espresso machines, but you should always check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific machine model.Pay particular attention to the ear placement and the overall portafilter dimensions. Some machines utilize a proprietary attachment mechanism, requiring a specific proprietary naked filter.

**How Do I Clean A Naked Filter?**

Cleaning involves removing the basket and thoroughly rinsing all parts with hot water. Periodic backflushing of the espresso machine is recommended to maintain cleanliness. you can also use a mild detergent to remove coffee oils and residue. Be sure to dry it immediately before reassembling. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as these may scratch the stainless steel.

**What Are The Signs Of A Bad Extraction When Using A Naked Filter?**

Visible channeling, squirting, or an uneven espresso stream indicates issues with the grind, tamping, or coffee distribution. If the espresso gushes out to quickly, it's likely a sign of a coarser grind. If it drips slowly or not at all, it could indicate a finer grind or over-tamping. An uneven stream often points to inconsistent tamping or coffee distribution.

**Are Naked Filters More Difficult To Use Than Standard Portafilters?**

Yes, generally they need a little more care because naked filters are unforgiving. They often amplify errors in preparation. But, in turn, it's frequently enough a better learning tool to improve coffee pulling skills. Expect to modify grind settings and tamping pressures until you find the right combination.

At the time, I avoided a lot of foods that had red dye in them, but since it's kind of in everything, I just slowly started eating small bits of it at a time, until at some point I was eating normal amounts of it and not having reactions anymore.

I'm in college now, and in my first year, I would have random reactions here and there with mild itching (very rarely was it true full-blown hives), and it was always when I had eaten something that contained red dye. Now, what I felt like was weird was that I wasn't having a reaction every single time I ate something with red dye in it, just occasionally, so I just kind of brushed it off since it didn't really affect me at all.

This year, (second year), I had a pretty bad allergic reaction with hives everywhere, and I felt a little dizzy, but the symptoms subsided after a little bit. The hives had started around my stomach (like they normally would), but spread to my back, chest, and arms last. To be fair, I had only had two cups of coffee and an entire bag of hot cheetos at the end of the day (it was a long day), so I'm not sure if that contributed to how bad the reaction was, since all I had really eaten was the hot cheetos. After that reaction, I was a little hesitant around foods with red dye in them, but ultimately decided to try it again in a small quantity, and nothing happened. I even had hot cheetoes again recently (a smaller bag this time though, I had eaten earlier in the day, and hadn't consumed any coffee), but no reaction.

Should I be consulting an allergist? I don't really know if hives are really a reason to be concerned, and I'm a little put off by how on and off the allergy is.

It made me realize how much our physical environment shapes our mood and interactions.    
  
Our old setup had the TV as the main focus, with chairs facing it like a theater. Now, we’ve turned the couch to face the windows (hello, natural light!), added a low coffee table where the kids can do puzzles, and moved the TV to a corner. Suddenly, we talk more. The kids draw on the floor while my partner and I read, and sometimes we even forget to turn the TV on.    
  
Another small change: I cleared off the kitchen counter. For years, it was cluttered with mail, keys, and half-opened packages. Now, there’s just a bowl of fruit and a small plant. I didn’t realize how much that clutter stressed me until it was gone—now I actually enjoy standing at the sink to wash dishes.

About the roomie(s) 
I've lived in the city for almost 10 yrs now. In my free time I enjoy being outside, exploring the city, hitting the gym, grabbing coffee, hanging out with friends, discovering a new food spot. When I’m home I usually am relaxing in my room and binge watching tiktok (I know, I know!). I like having a friendly relationship with my roomies. I'm quiet and laid back, and value assertive yet respectful communication style.

M is from Cali, she enjoys hanging out with her friends, traveling, playing with her cat, and doing voice lessons in her off time. Bubbly, social, and easy to connect with.

1mkjvuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VitalHaven/comments/1mkjvuz/the_power_of_small_daily_rituals_in_our_household/,The Power of Small Daily Rituals in Our Household,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how the tiny, repeated moments in our home life shape our overall health—more than any grand New Year’s resolution ever could. For example, my partner and I started a 5-minute “morning check-in” over coffee before the kids wake up. We don’t talk about to-do lists; we just ask, “How are you \*really\* feeling?” It’s惊人 how much calmer the day feels when we start with that connection.    
  
Then there’s our evening routine: after dinner, instead of everyone scattering to screens, we take 10 minutes to tidy the kitchen together. The kids race to put away their plates, my partner wipes the counters, and I load the dishwasher. It’s not glamorous, but that small act of teamwork makes the space feel lighter, and no one wakes up to a messy kitchen.    
  
I also started keeping a jar by the front door where we jot down one good thing that happened each day—a kid’s funny comment, a sunny walk, a quiet cup of tea. On tough days, we pull out a note and laugh or sigh together.    
  
Do you have tiny rituals in your household that keep you grounded or healthy? I’d love to hear them—sometimes the simplest ideas are the ones that stick.  ",1,1754621583.0,VitalHaven,0,1.0,False

Before this diet I struggled losing weight and was diagnosed with insulin resistance, PCOS, and prescribed metformin. This after years of ruining my gut with pain medication and birth control in an attempt to “feel better” and balance hormones . I’ve tried it all, and for the past three years I was eating Whole Foods , dairy free, sugar free diet and found myself slowing gaining so carnivore seemed like the one last thing to try . 

90 days in, this are my results so far :

- down 25lbs 
- down 8”in my stomach 
- down 5” in my waist 

Things that happened along the way :

- started 30 days of strict carnivore (beef, butter , salt)  
- took 30 days to enjoy the taste of butter and beef with little to no salt 
- after thirty days I introduced cream for my coffee and that gave me a terrible skin flare (because of my dairy allergy , idk what I was thinking) and had to cut all dairy, including butter , completely . It took 3 weeks for my skin to heal . 
- 60 days in a developed a histamine intolerance .i was eating a lot of bacon and pork rinds , plus I don’t think the dairy flare helped my system response . I cut back on the pork , have switched to only cooking fresh and never eating leftovers . My histamine response has chilled out .  
- no longer bloated 
- my energy levels are all over the place 
- still havnt developed a big appetite. I eat small Meals three times a day (2 chicken thighs or half a pound beef  or 1 steak)


Overall I am happy with how I am feeling . I am getting really tired of cooking and having the same things. But the goal for me is to heal my stomach and transition to an animal based diet . So however long that takes , I’m on this ride . 

Thanks for reading , Sorry for the long post !

1mkjv89,https://v.redd.it/cy303b26bphf1,Teapot tornado.,"This is a failed attempt to get particle image velocimetry in the vertical cross-section of a cyclonic flow in cylindrical coordinates, so I thought I'd post some cool tornadic-related observations. My goal with this was to experimentally verify some solutions I found to unsteady Beltrami flow under certain Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Initiated by a coffee frother, the azimuthal circulation induces secondary circulation in the meridional r-z plane by virtue of the frictional boundary layer interaction with the floor (z=0). The ""updraft"" laminarizes in the presence of torsional stress transferring from the frother to the floor, stabilizing the azimuthal velocity, which in turn, stabilizes meridional velocities. This recursion between the two planar flows generates a fast-rotating, localized swirl column with a singularity at the vortex base.

Welcome to r/TheOutdoorCraftLabA—the spot where duct tape fixes *almost* everything, and “imperfect” just means “extra character.”This isn’t a club for folks with Pinterest-worthy woodworking skills (though if you’ve figured out how to stop rope from fraying? Spill the hack). It’s for the person who tried to carve a spoon and ended up with a lopsided “abstract art” utensil. The crafter who gathered seashells to make a wind chime… that sounds more like a clattering disaster (but hey, the seagulls love it). The DIYer who attempted to build a campfire grill from scrap metal and now calls it their “rustic masterpiece” (even if it cooks hot dogs unevenly).Share your “craft fails turned wins”: “My attempt at a woven stick chair collapsed, but now it’s a *super cozy* ground cushion!

It’s a little wonky, but it stirs my campfire coffee like a champ.”We get it. Outdoor crafting is half creativity, half “why did I think this was a good idea?” Like when you tried to make a tent from old tarps and ended up with a structure that leaks more than it keeps the rain out. Or when you spent hours whittling a wooden figurine, only to realize it looks more like a potato with legs (but you still keep it on your shelf). But those are the moments that make your projects yours—glue smudges, splinters, and all.Grab your toolbox (and maybe a first-aid kit, just in case). Let’s swap stories about the time your homemade lantern caught fire (small fire!) or how you turned a pile of rocks into a “sculpture” that confused your hiking buddies. Here, the messier the process, the louder we cheer.

My biggest problem was late-night snacking…especially when smoking.

Having a hard cut-off time has been a total game changer. No more debating with myself about “can I have one?” or “just a little bit?”—once my window is closed, it’s closed. It’s such a relief to not be constantly negotiating with my own brain.

I’m not a perfect faster either. I do a little “dirty fasting” in the mornings…coffee with chobani creamer, then water until I break my fast at noon. Diet Coke here and there at night. For me, when I stop eating is way more important than a perfectly clean fast.

The biggest win is the consistency. Like today I’m on my period and definitely ate more than usual, but instead of it turning into a full-on “screw it, I’ll start over tomorrow” binge at night, I just stopped at my normal time. It’s such a nice feeling to still have boundaries even on off days",14,1754621335.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

While ramping up for my ER, I really appreciated reading about how others prepared, along with their background and results. I hope this is helpful or interesting or instills some hope! 💖 also SIA if formatting is weird.. I’m on my phone.

I’m 33f with hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, and fibroids. My AMH was .89 in May 2025. AFC last checked was 13. Also I’m 5’5 and 143 lbs, so within “healthy” range BMI (I don’t take much stock in BMI but am sharing for those who may want to know).

My lifestyle & diet:
I eat almost 100% whole foods and as much organic as I can afford (especially the dirty dozen). I’ve swapped to loose leaf green tea (though I love and miss coffee), drink at least 2 litres of water a day, and try to get 8h sleep every night. I’m not the most active and could be better in this regard. 

I eat a primarily Mediterranean diet with seafood, beans, and chicken as my proteins, and I try to get minimum 75g of protein a day. I eat lots of fresh and baked veggies. I’ve been seed cycling for over a year, and I eat nuts and seeds everyday with breakfast. I don’t have much sugar, but I love dessert so I have dark chocolate or frozen fruit every night. I try to have a low glycemic index diet. I also eat some type of fermented food every day with lunch (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, etc). I’m a proponent of the 80/20 rule so I indulge every once in a while outside the above!

I stopped all alcohol and recreational drugs for about 6 months prior to my ER (I previously was into edibles so this was a sacrifice for me lol).

I really try to reduce how much plastic exposure I have. No tinned foods, only glass Tupperware, no plastic wrap or ziplocs on food, etc.

I also have swapped all beauty, skincare, dental, and hair care products to well rated products on EWG or the Yuka app.

I did acupuncture once a week for three weeks leading up to ER. Also while on stims I increased my intake to 3-4 litres and drank strictly electrolytes and not just water. 

My meds & supplements:

*asterisks are those I added in about 4 weeks before transfer as per a naturopath’s advice. Everything else I took for several months or longer. 


My protocol:
- primed with lupin-estradiol 2mg (CD6-25) & prometrium 2x200mg (CD18-25) 
- Took 6 days off, cycle restarted

Results:
9 retrieved > 6 mature > 6 fertilized (5 normal, 1 abnormal one pronuclei) > 5 blastocysts which were 5AA, 5AA, 4AA, 3BB, 3BB (one 3BB was the one pronuclei) > 4 euploids (the one pronuclei was haploid/aneuploid)

1mkjqlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1mkjqlo/advice_on_an_old_allergy/,Advice on An Old Allergy,"So to explain, when I was a kid, I had a red food dye allergy that resulted in a range from mild to severe hives. At the time, I avoided a lot of foods that had red dye in them, but since it's kind of in everything, I just slowly started eating small bits of it at a time, until at some point I was eating normal amounts of it and not having reactions anymore.

I'm in college now, and in my first year, I would have random reactions here and there with mild itching (very rarely was it true full-blown hives), and it was always when I had eaten something that contained red dye. Now, what I felt like was weird was that I wasn't having a reaction every single time I ate something with red dye in it, just occasionally, so I just kind of brushed it off since it didn't really affect me at all.

This year, (second year), I had a pretty bad allergic reaction with hives everywhere, and I felt a little dizzy, but the symptoms subsided after a little bit. The hives had started around my stomach (like they normally would), but spread to my back, chest, and arms last. To be fair, I had only had two cups of coffee and an entire bag of hot cheetos at the end of the day (it was a long day), so I'm not sure if that contributed to how bad the reaction was, since all I had really eaten was the hot cheetos. After that reaction, I was a little hesitant around foods with red dye in them, but ultimately decided to try it again in a small quantity, and nothing happened. I even had hot cheetoes again recently (a smaller bag this time though, I had eaten earlier in the day, and hadn't consumed any coffee), but no reaction.

Should I be consulting an allergist? I don't really know if hives are really a reason to be concerned, and I'm a little put off by how on and off the allergy is.

I said I would leave you be and I never thought in a million years you would allow that. I saw your flaws and picked you up when you were alone. I never meant to fall for you but I did. That scared you. You are an avoidant that shuts down when you have to explain your feelings, you cut and run. You told me that. I never thought you would do that to me. We shared, I was helping you build your life back after bad men tried to destroy you. I was there. I listened and I learned you. I fucked up and told you I wanted you to myself and didn’t want to be an option. That clearly was too much. I never asked you to change or be someone else. I just wanted to be your only guy. You don’t want that. You would rather close the door on me, kill me and us with silence. This is better??? I don’t understand. You have kids. You’re still buying coffee and lunch with my credit card, but can’t even say hi. Wow. I never took you for this person. I was wrong. I have had time to see, to feel and to understand what I am/was to you. The pain out weighs the pleasure. No more cards, no more trips, no more Louis’s, no more Chanel.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tennis Showdown: Katie Volynets vs. Varvara Gracheva – A Cincinnati Open First-Round Rumble**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn, because we’re diving into a first-round clash at the 2025 Cincinnati Open that’s as tightly priced as a can of tennis balls in a vacuum-sealed bag. Katie Volynets, the British upstart with a serve that could start a jet engine, faces off against Varvara Gracheva, the Russian grinder who plays like she’s auditioning for a role in *The Matrix* (but with more volleying). Let’s parse the odds, digest the “news,” and serve up a prediction with a side of humor.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are in near-unanimous agreement: **Varvara Gracheva is the favorite**. Her decimal odds hover around **1.81–1.83**, translating to an implied probability of **\~55%** to win. Katie Volynets, meanwhile, sits at **\~50%**, with odds between 1.91 and 2.0. The spread markets back this up, giving Gracheva a **-1.0 to -1.5 game** edge, while the total games line is locked at **21.5**, with even money on Over/Under.

What does this mean? Simply: Gracheva is expected to win comfortably, but not so comfortably that bookmakers expect Volynets to pack her bags and go home. The spread suggests a **2–1 victory for Gracheva**, while the total hints at a match that’s long enough to make even the most dedicated fan reach for their second cup of coffee.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Your Aunt Can’t Help

Unfortunately, there’s no juicy scandal or injury report to spice this one up. Gracheva’s camp hasn’t announced that she’s recovering from a “mysterious pizza-related incident,” and Volynets hasn’t tripped over her own shoelaces in a press conference. But here’s what we *do* know:

* **Gracheva’s form** is as steady as a metronome set to “tennis victory.” She’s coming off a clay-court run where she looked like a woman possessed by the spirit of Billie Jean King (but with better hair).
* **Volynets**, on the other hand, is the definition of a “dark horse” — or, as

Anyways, I moved to a new town age 25, male, and honestly life has been pretty good. I socialize at work and that’s pretty much all I need. I come home and drink coffee, study, watch TV… I keep myself busy.

But my Dad emailed me today and said I need to “get out more.” He then compared me to my extroverted sister and how she socializes more than I do.

I felt very hurt. Lots of shame. I just complied and agreed with my dad, and started signing up for things. I felt like I didn’t have a choice and it was the only way to make these awful feelings go away. My dad is super extroverted and loved high school and college. That just wasn’t me and those were some of the hardest most shameful years of my life. I am his only son. 

I called my Mom later and cried a bit, and she basically told me to “do what’s best for me.” She is a very wonderful person. It was like a weight was lifted. I immediately felt better and continued on with my evening.

Any ideas on how to counter this? It just feels so overwhelming sometimes. Thanks.

Some of the comments surprised me. Quite a few people were convinced that this couldn't be true, or that the person eating the lunches was mad/autistic/poor/etc. Color me abnormal then because my eating habits are also minimalist. I thought I'd see what the community here has to say. Considering that we're all *already* minimalists here - do your eating habits also reflect the lifestyle? How?

For myself, I see eating as utilitarian for the most part. Breakfast is to start the day and I choose between a handful of items - mostly fruit, coffee or tea, maybe some baguette with jam. We have oatmeal around in the winter. Lunch is the same thing pretty much every day - rice, tofu, fruit, veggies, miso soup. Dinners have a bit more choice between rice + topping, soup, stew, ramen, potatoes, Buddha bowl - mostly throwing together whatever beans/lentils, veg, rice that I have on hand. We drink water, tea, or black coffee. I stock only what I need in a small refrigerator + a small pantry. It takes just a moment to see what I have on hand that needs to be eaten to figure out what I'll make. I've been to countless friends' and family members' home and witnessed hours of debate and arguments on what to eat and I am happy to avoid that.

I’ve become aware today that my coparent (m27)has been abusing lots of different substances which I already suspected from the lack of visits the past few months. I didn’t realize it was as bad as it is until I was made aware today. I thought he was partying and whatnot but not when he was around our child (F2 3/4). I saw messages of him discussing with his drug dealer prices and what types of drugs and then my coparent stated he had our child but that he would drop her off with his dad for a few hours so he could go hangout. Then the messages have the address shared and him saying he’s on his way but that he has to pick her up around whatever time it said. This has me freaking out. Knowing he went and bought drugs and probably did them and then proceeded to drive in a vehicle with my child has me freaking out. 
That was the major message that had me worried but there was a lot more. The drugs he’s doing are crazy drugs like ketamine, cocaine, mushrooms, acid, nitrous oxide. 
I was told by my lawyer previously that I should keep our agreed arrangement going until our case goes to trial and we get a court order as to not alienate him, but I also had no real proof of his drug use or admissible in court anyways. 
I have pictures of what his house looks like when I’ve been to pick her up and he always has marijuana and paraphernalia etc on the coffee table where she can easily reach and now that I’m aware he’s using other drugs and having them in his house I’m so worried she could get ahold of them and die or that she’d get super sick and he wouldn’t help her as to not get himself in trouble. A few messages he discussed mushroom chocolates that got him extremely messed up. And she loves chocolate she would easily eat something chocolate not knowing any better. I’m so worried and want to deny anymore visits. I tried calling my lawyer but he was in depositions all day and could only talk for a quick 5 minutes I was able to tell him what I’ve found out and he said this is huge but we will have to discuss it another time so I have no idea what to do. He is supposed to get her tomorrow for the weekend and I’m so scared I really want to deny him this weekend until I can speak to my lawyer but have no idea how to go about it. He’s already texted me tonight asking me if he could get her tonight and she skip preschool tomorrow and then he asked if he could get her early atleast after I didn’t respond I have no idea what to say and now I’m terrified to send her to school and he’ll just pick her up without my knowledge or approval and the daycare has told me they cannot deny him access to pick her up without a court order and we are still in our custody battle with no judge signed court order. I sent messages to my lawyer asking if we could file an emergency order but haven’t received an answer I’m so worried for her safety, I can not allow her to go there knowing the things I know. Does anyone have any advice?


Also to add he has been behind on child support for 4-5 months but in the messages I saw he has been buying lots of different women tickets to music festivals and buying hotels and buying drugs and going to the casino and losing and buying scratch offs and losing. He told me he quit his job to go independent (sells insurance) but that it takes time to make money and he’d have some eventually and that he is going to be moving in with his dad into his spare room.

Another day in the RPD for R3make Jill Valentine and RE4make Leon S. Kennedy.  Stopping at the vending machine to grab some coffee in the East Corridor to the Watchmen Room, Leon talks to Jill about his day on the job in Raccoon City. Is Jill taking a liking to this new agent assisting the RPD?  Leon offers up his toned bicep to get Jill's mind off the long hours of work investigating Raccoon City's corruption. Leon recounts his last mission to Jill who has been working long hours investigating Raccoon City's corruption and keeping it's citizens safe.

\-------------------------

There isn't enough Jill and Leon around in the world! They have both been in the Resident Evil/Biohazard universe since it was released back in the mid 90s but never crossed paths in the games. The only canon on-screen meeting they have was in Death Island. They recognised each other, so what's going on!? Anyways, I started looking for Jill and Leon or Jilleon for short, content on the net. There's not that much, especially voiced animated scenes.

# Best Privacy Screen 2025: Top Choices & Expert Guide

Privacy screens have become essential accessories for laptops, desktops, and mobile devices in today's interconnected world. they offer a simple yet effective way to protect sensitive details from prying eyes, whether you're working in a coffee shop, traveling on a plane, or simply want to maintain confidentiality in a shared office space. Selecting the right privacy screen can considerably improve yoru security and peace of mind, and this guide will explore the top choices available in 2025. Based on expert reviews and technological advancements, we'll break down the key features and benefits, ensuring you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a privacy screen hinges on several critical features. These include the degree of viewing angle restriction, the quality of the display, the ease of installation, and the overall durability of the screen. Understanding these features is key to selecting the optimal choice for your specific needs.

**Viewing Angle Restriction**

A privacy screen's primary function is to narrow the viewing angle of your device's display. the tighter the angle, the more effectively it prevents onlookers from seeing your screen.Most high-quality privacy screens restrict the viewing angle to around 60 degrees, allowing only the person directly in front of the screen to see it clearly. This specification directly impacts the security level the privacy screen delivers.

**Display Clarity and Brightness**

While restricting viewing angles, a good privacy screen should maintain acceptable display clarity and brightness. cheaper privacy screens frequently enough significantly reduce brightness and introduce noticeable distortion, which can strain your eyes over extended periods. High-end screens utilize advanced materials and coatings to minimize light loss and maintain a sharp, clear image. The best models claim to only reduce brightness by a small percentage.

**Installation and Attachment Method**

Privacy screens typically attach to devices using either adhesive strips, reusable adhesive, or frame mounts. Adhesive strips provide a secure but permanent attachment, while reusable adhesives allow for easy removal and reapplication.Frame mounts offer the most versatility, allowing the screen to be easily clipped on and off as needed, but they may not fit all devices. The ease and stability of the attachment is crucial to a positive user experience.

**Material and Durability**

The material used to construct the privacy screen directly impacts its durability and resistance to scratches and wear. Premium screens are typically made from high-quality acrylic or tempered glass, which offers excellent protection against scratches and impacts. These materials also tend to be more resistant to fingerprints and smudges, maintaining a cleaner appearance. A well constructed privacy screen will extend the overall lifespan of the screen and protect it for years.

**Touchscreen Compatibility**

Many modern devices incorporate touchscreen functionality, and a compatible privacy screen is essential for maintaining that capability. Some privacy screens can interfere with touch sensitivity, requiring users to press harder or multiple times to register input. Look for screens specifically designed for touchscreen devices, as they are engineered to minimize this issue. It is important to verify touchscreen compatibility prior to purchase to ensure seamless integration with your device.

**Blue Light Filtering**

Prolonged exposure to blue light emitted from screens can lead to eye strain and sleep disturbances. Some privacy screens incorporate blue light filters to help mitigate these effects. By blocking a portion of the blue light spectrum, these screens can reduce eye fatigue and promote better sleep patterns, especially for users who spend long hours working on their devices. Look for certifications or self-reliant lab tests that verify the effectiveness of the blue light filtering.

## Core Benefits

A quality privacy screen offers a range of practical benefits beyond just visual security, impacting productivity, comfort, and overall peace of mind. These often go unnoticed until you experience the limitations of a subpar screen.

**Enhanced Data Security:** The most significant benefit is the enhanced data security provided by limiting viewing angles. In public spaces like coffee shops or airplanes, a privacy screen prevents shoulder surfers from visually accessing sensitive information on your screen. This offers a crucial layer of protection against potential data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential data. In today's evolving digital landscape, this enhanced privacy is a vital asset.

**Reduced Eye Strain:** High-quality privacy screens not only protect your data but also minimize eye strain. By reducing glare and filtering blue light, these screens can significantly reduce eye fatigue, especially for individuals who spend extended periods working on their devices. This leads to enhanced comfort and productivity throughout the day. Many users report a noticeable difference in eye comfort after switching to a quality privacy screen.

**Increased Productivity:** By minimizing distractions and ensuring focus on the task at hand, privacy screens can contribute to increased productivity. When you're confident that your screen is shielded from prying eyes, you can work with greater concentration and less anxiety, leading to improved efficiency and output. This is especially valuable in open office environments or shared workspaces.

**Physical Screen Protection:** Many privacy screens,especially those made from tempered glass or durable acrylic,offer an additional layer of physical protection for your device's screen. They can help prevent scratches,smudges,and minor impacts,thereby prolonging the lifespan of your device and maintaining its pristine appearance. This added protection is a valuable bonus, especially for devices that are frequently transported or used in perhaps hazardous environments.

**Improved Confidentiality:** Whether you're dealing with sensitive business documents, personal financial information, or private communications, a privacy screen ensures that your on-screen activities remain confidential. This is particularly crucial for professionals in fields like finance, healthcare, and law, where maintaining client confidentiality is paramount. Using a privacy screen demonstrates a commitment to data protection and reinforces trust with clients and colleagues.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about privacy screens ensures potential buyers are fully informed before making a purchase, enhancing their satisfaction and confidence in their investment.

**Will a privacy screen significantly reduce the brightness of my display?**

The impact on brightness varies depending on the quality of the privacy screen. Lower-quality screens can substantially reduce brightness, making the display challenging to see, especially in bright environments. High-quality screens, however, use advanced materials that minimize light loss, typically reducing brightness by 10-20%. Reading user reviews and checking product specifications can provide insights into the potential impact on brightness.

**How easy is it to remove and reapply the privacy screen?**

The ease of removal and reapplication depends on the attachment method used. Screens with adhesive strips are typically permanent and cannot be easily removed without potentially damaging the screen or the device. Screens with reusable adhesives offer easier removal and reapplication, although the adhesive may lose its effectiveness over time. Frame-mounted screens are the easiest to remove and reapply, offering maximum versatility.

**Are privacy screens compatible with all laptop models?**

Privacy screens are not universally compatible with all laptop models. They are typically designed to fit specific screen sizes and aspect ratios. Before purchasing a privacy screen, it is essential to check the product specifications and ensure that it is compatible with your laptop model's screen size and dimensions. Some manufacturers offer compatibility charts or search tools to help you find the right fit.

**Do privacy screens affect the touch sensitivity of touch screen devices?**

Some privacy screens can affect the touch sensitivity of touchscreen devices. The added layer of material can reduce the responsiveness of the screen, requiring users to press harder or more frequently to register input. Though, high-quality privacy screens designed specifically for touchscreen devices are engineered to minimize this issue. Reading reviews and looking for screens that advertise touchscreen compatibility can help you avoid this problem.

I want advice on how to best protect myself from being wrongfully terminated or forced out. I’m not trying to escalate the situation unnecessarily (I can function in a difficult work environment) but I want to ensure I’m not being set up or scapegoated.

My Role:
I lead documentation and reporting on operational issues across teams. My job is to identify risks (not enforce them) so leadership can address them. I’ve been reporting on dysfunction, performance breakdowns, and hostile behaviors in weekly reports, per my boss’s request.

Sexual Harassment and Hostility:
Earlier this year, my boss flagged a sexual harassment issue involving a senior leader (“Steve”) and insisted I make a formal report to HR. The harassment included Steve staring at my chest and his friend making sexually demeaning comments. I later learned this wasn’t the first complaint. This report also included the greater picture of intimidation and hostility from these two towards the team that was resulting in risk to our resources. HR said they’d follow up (in accordance with our policy) but never did. Since then, I’ve continued to flag in my operational reports related behaviors as Steve becomes increasingly uncooperative with all teams/process, and as I receive concerned reports from his team about intimidation and retaliation toward them. 

Steve and my boss are both team leaders. I work with both, among other teams, and tensions have escalated after my reports. Despite my pregnancy and remote flexibility previously being verbally approved, I’m now being required back in the office after Steve’s constant comments on my presence there (even when I was there and just not in his eyeline). Most of the team, including my boss and the CEO, are remote. 

My boss has begun sharing my reports about Steve directly with him without talking to me first, then debriefing me on his reactions and implying I’m responsible for the tension and the very issues I’m reporting on. He’s ignoring other issues I report and has even suggested I take Steve coffee daily to “ease tension.” Recently, he’s challenged my promotion path, requiring a “trial period” no one else has had, and suggested my direct report to report to Steve to replace me.    

I’m afraid that continuing to fulfill my job duties (accurate operational reporting) is being used against me, while stopping would mean failing at my role. I’m worried about retaliation, hostile work conditions, and being pushed out without recourse, despite strong performance.

I have ZERO ideas for a project for this subreddit that could be supported by these funds. So I'm reaching out to you, the members of this subreddit:

What could be an ""engaging experience"" for this community, something that reflects its mission, that could be supported by the Reddit Community Funds program? Something related to promoting or supporting volunteer engagement in cause-based initiatives (helping others, helping the environment, promoting the arts, bringing communities together through volunteering, etc.). An in-person meeting or event probably wouldn't be it - this community has more than 20,000 members from all over. 

2026 is the 25th anniversary of the International Year of Volunteers. Something in relation to that? (okay, I have ONE idea afterall - but nothing specific. For instance, what would we need funding for in relation to that?).

I thought that was weird because she had just seen her yesterday, wasn't feeling good, and then was seeing her again on the day we had plans. But she did tell me she'd see me tonight. Around 5:30 I was getting ready to go to her house at 6, when I was about to leave I got a text from her mom saying, oh her and so and so are leaving at 6:30 to go somewhere. So I spent 30 minutes getting ready, just to be canceled on for the same friend again. Her mom said I was still welcome to go over until they left. Obviously I was pissed, because we had plans that she kept canceling for the same friend. So after I got that text from her mom, I sent her that text. I feel kind of bad because obviously I was mad but I didn't want to be rude. Don you think Overreacted, let me know please🙏",2,1754619348.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

**Context**: As I move to upgrade my XFX GTS Radeon RX 580 Series (8GB) to a XFX Swift OC Radeon RX 9060 XT (16GB), I'm reading some advice to update the motherboard to the latest BIOS version to avoid issues during the [DDU-enabled GPU upgrade method](https://youtu.be/jxwDPu_hOD4?si=0Pzh7KCCdGvhzAGP).

When I look at the [ASRock B365M Pro4 BIOS support page](https://www.asrock.com/mb/intel/b365m%20pro4/index.asp#BIOS), it mentions two newer versions than what I'm running now:

* **4.51A \[Beta\]**, **2023/9/14**, (1) Optimize NVME SSD compatibility, and (2) add setup item ""C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
* **4.50, 2021/8/17**, (1) Support Microsoft Windows 11, and (2) ""Intel(R) Platform Trust Technology"" (Software TPM) is enabled by default

However, two warnings are making me nervous to move away from my working v4.40:

***\* User will not able to flash previous BIOS once upgrading to this BIOS version or later version.***  
***\*\* We don't recommend users to update the BIOS if their system is already running normally.***

  
**System Specs**

* **Motherboard**: ASRock B365M Pro4, Version P4.40
* **CPU Model:** Intel Core i5-9400F @ 2.90GHz, Model E
* **GPU Model:** Radeon RX 580 Series (8GB)
* **OS:** Windows 10 Home

  
r/ASRock mods -- I skimmed the [Weekly BIOS Update Post - Week 13. 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/126g1pw/weekly_bios_update_post_week_13_2023/), but didn't see any information related to my question there.

I said something like มาเป็นระลอก.

ChatGPT says it's fine but the lucky lady who was sitting opposite me at the time still hasn't stopped laughing. And there's a serious point because one of the challenges in acquiring vocab is to know how formal / informal or common / uncommon a word is. If this word really is too rare or formal for the situation, my process didn't pick that up. As I say though, ChatGPT says it's fine.

So is ระลอก out of place here and what is the most natural way to get the idea across?",1,1754619155.0,learnthai,10,1.0,False

And coffee actually relaxes me. I was gonna finish a little journal writing and that’s about it. I didn’t even have my computer with me. I’ve been on vacation all week so I’ve been home all week and honestly, I’m not inspired to complete some projects IN my house, if that makes sense. Plus, I get my inspiration after 4 pm, for whatever reason. 🤦🏾‍♀️😆 Most folks are winding down after 9 and I’m wide awake. Eh. 

I’m a night owl and I’m a huge fan of “3rd spaces”. I LOVE the libraries that stay open until 8 or 9. However, there aren’t many places open past 9 where you can continue to sit and read or write or whatever. Why is that? I did find out the other day that the Starbucks in Trussville stays open until 9:30, which is better than some SBux that close at 8. 😑 Then again, I’m beginning to think there’s something wrong with me that I think better outside of my house. I’m ready to downsize and declutter so I can’t really focus at home.

I know we have some posts on here that discuss “3rd spaces” and I’ll do a quick search later.  But mainly I came here to just share my surprise that they lock the doors at 9. You can still get WH to go, but is it REALLY WH if you don’t eat in? ☺️😆

Anyway, just sharing thoughts with some of my closest friends in Birmingham! 🤗

I am mostly approached by men but I am bisexual, so I am using my experiences as basis for my reasoning.) I believe men think the friendzone is an inescapable pit, and once they reach that they give up on a woman, and they try speedrunning courtship by jumping straight to nudes, and get so upset when they’re rejected. 

In reality, women want safe and comfortable men. Nearly all of my friends have settled with someone they were friends with first, who they took the time to know and respect. 

IMO it is actually a HUGE advantage being in the friendzone, as I also usually go for men/women I have met and am comfortable with. 

I’ve been reading about the male loneliness epidemic, and firmly believe it’s from the instant gratification of porn and hookup culure. Fewer people want to put the work in for legitimate relationships, they don’t want to compromise or put in the time.

# Cold Press Soap: Top 5 Brands Reviewed [2025]

Cold press soap has surged in popularity as consumers increasingly seek natural and sustainable skincare options. Unlike conventional soap-making methods that rely on high heat, the cold process preserves the beneficial properties of the oils and botanicals used. this results in a milder, more moisturizing bar that's gentler on the skin and better for the surroundings. in this review, we'll explore the top 5 cold press soap brands of 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and why they stand out in the market. This guide will help you navigate the world of cold press soap and find the perfect bar for your skin's needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of cold press soap hinges on several key factors, including the ingredients used, the saponification process, and the curing period.

**Ingredient Quality and Sourcing:** The finest cold press soaps rely on high-quality, ethically sourced ingredients. Look for soaps that use organic oils like olive, coconut, and shea butter, as well as natural additives like essential oils and plant-based colorants. Avoid soaps with synthetic fragrances, artificial colors, or harsh chemicals. Clarity in sourcing is critical; brands that disclose their suppliers and farming practices demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and quality.

**Saponification Process:** Cold process saponification involves combining oils with an alkali solution (lye) to create soap. The skill of the soap maker lies in precisely controlling this process to ensure complete saponification, leaving no residual lye in the finished product. A well-executed saponification ensures a mild and gentle soap that won't irritate the skin. Each brand employs slightly different techniques and ratios, resulting in unique characteristics in the final product.

**Curing Period:** after saponification, cold press soap must undergo a curing period, typically lasting several weeks. This allows excess water to evaporate, resulting in a harder, longer-lasting bar. Curing also allows the saponification process to complete fully, further reducing the likelihood of irritation.The longer the curing period, the milder and more durable the soap tends to be. Most of the brands cure their soaps for at least 4 weeks.

**Added Botanicals and Essential Oils:** Many cold press soaps incorporate botanicals like herbs, flowers, and clays, as well as essential oils for fragrance and therapeutic benefits. These additions can enhance the soap's cleansing, moisturizing, and exfoliating properties. Look for soaps that use essential oils at safe dilutions and botanicals that are appropriate for your skin type. Some brands use natural colorants derived from plants to add visual appeal without harsh chemicals.

**Packaging and Sustainability:** Environmentally conscious brands prioritize sustainable packaging options like recycled paper, biodegradable wraps, and minimal plastic. The overall sustainability of the brand, including its manufacturing practices and commitment to reducing waste, is a factor that increasingly influences consumer choice. Brands committed to plastic-free shipping are preferred.

## Core benefits

Cold press soap offers a range of benefits over conventional soaps, making it a preferred choice for those seeking gentle and effective cleansing.

**Gentle cleansing and moisturizing:** Unlike mass-produced soaps that often strip the skin of its natural oils, cold press soap retains glycerin, a natural humectant. Glycerin attracts moisture to the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated.The milder saponification process and the use of nourishing oils ensure gentle cleansing without excessive dryness or irritation.

**Suitable for Sensitive Skin:** The absence of harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and artificial colors makes cold press soap an excellent choice for individuals with sensitive skin or conditions like eczema and psoriasis. The natural ingredients and gentle formulation help soothe irritated skin and reduce the risk of allergic reactions. Many brands offer specific formulations tailored for sensitive skin.

**Natural and Environmentally Friendly:** Cold press soap is typically made with biodegradable ingredients, making it a more environmentally friendly option compared to synthetic detergents and soaps. The sustainable sourcing of ingredients and the use of eco-friendly packaging further contribute to its appeal for environmentally conscious consumers.The cold process itself uses less energy than hot process soap making.**Aromatherapy Benefits:** The use of essential oils in cold press soap provides aromatherapy benefits,promoting relaxation,stress relief,and improved mood. The natural scents derived from plants are gentler and more complex than synthetic fragrances, creating a subtly therapeutic experience.The selection of essential oils used can be tailored to specific needs, such as promoting relaxation or providing an energizing boost.

## FAQs Section

**What is the difference between cold press soap and regular soap?**
Cold press soap is made using a process that keeps all natural ingredients intact,including glycerin. Regular soap making uses high heat and often removes or dilutes glycerin, leaving the product less moisturizing. Cold process soap is much gentler on the skin and is environmentally friendlier.

**How long does cold press soap last?**
The lifespan of a bar of cold press soap depends on factors like usage frequency, water hardness, and storage conditions. To prolong its life, store the soap on a well-draining soap dish away from direct water contact and the use of a wash cloth. Generally, a well-cured bar can last for several weeks with daily use.

**Can I use cold press soap on my face?**
Yes, cold press soap can be used on the face, but it's essential to choose a formulation that's appropriate for your skin type. Look for soaps with gentle ingredients like olive oil,shea butter,and chamomile,and avoid those with harsh exfoliants or fragrances. Always patch-test the soap on a small area of skin before using it all over your face.**Is cold press soap safe for children?**
Cold press soap can be a safe and gentle option for children, provided that it's formulated with mild, non-irritating ingredients. Avoid soaps with strong essential oils or additives that could perhaps cause allergic reactions. Always supervise children when using soap and be mindful of their individual skin sensitivities.

1mkiw2p,https://v.redd.it/lk5d85b2ephf1,2.19ct Cushion Rose Cut Lab Diamond in Coffee Brown – Matte Gold Custom Ring Concept ☕💎,"Just wanted to share a beautiful stone that’s been inspiring some warm, vintage-leaning design ideas lately!

✨ Specs:
	•	Carat: 2.19ct
	•	Cut: Cushion Rose Cut – soft facets with that old-world charm
	•	Color: Lab-grown coffee brown – rich and moody in all the right ways
	•	Dimensions: 7.6 × 7.69 × 4.51 mm
	•	Metal: Planning to set it in 10k Yellow Gold with a matte/brushed band finish for a soft, organic feel

I love how the rose cut and warm hue of this stone pair perfectly with a matte gold band – it gives off an understated luxury that feels both earthy and elegant. Thinking of keeping the setting minimal to let the diamond speak, maybe with tiny accent stones or subtle texture to complement the glow.

Sharing this as design inspiration, but also – if this speaks to your style, I’m open for custom inquiries. I love working 1:1 to bring unique pieces to life, and this one’s just waiting for the perfect setting. 💍

Feel free to message me anytime if you’re curious or want to explore a custom idea!

**""The Great Iowa Shuckdown""** – This week’s *This Week in the 3-Verse* has it all: playoff chaos in Bumper2Bumper, a 4-way tie busted in Flirtin’ w/Disaster, FatmanSports *not* making Tier A moves.

I wasn’t at the track — still recovering from GenCon — but I dug through the DIT3 scoresheets like they were classified docs in a storage unit. The results? Some teams are on cruise control. Others… well, they’re one bad Joey Gase pick away from getting totally *shucked*.

It’s Iowa week, so buckle up — things are about to… pop off.

Look, I’m still running on convention hall fumes after GenCon. My step count for the weekend was north of 40,000, I’m still finding dice in my pockets, and I may or may not have spent half of Saturday explaining the Thunder Rolls expansion to a guy who thought it was a sea shanty card game. I’ve got about 36 hours to unpack, wash the good polo, and hit the road for Watkins Glen — but before I even think about climbing into that press box, I sat down with a strong coffee and the latest DIT3 scoresheets. If I wasn’t at the track, I was at least in the numbers.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bumper2Bumper

B2B is the head-to-head cousin of the Debris in Turn 3 Championship — same scoring DNA, but you’re lining up against another owner each week and hoping their roster blows a tire. We’ve got 50 teams split into Wallace, Gordon, Burton, and Elliott Divisions, and almost all of them make their starts every week. In fantasy terms, that’s like a unicorn sighting.

This is only the second season, but last year already gave us lore: Mythos took on FatmanSports in the inaugural B2B Bowl. Season two’s playoff race is starting to crystallize, but the playoff structure’s still in flux because the Competition Committee is, and I quote, “deliberating” — which in DIT3 means they’re running twelve spreadsheets, four simulations, and possibly feeding old Fantrax data into a refurbished slot machine to see what comes out. 

As it stands, 36 teams make the dance: top five from each division (20 total), plus 16 wildcards. But there’s a push to cut that wildcard number to 8. Mythos floated the “8” idea, while other CC members are reportedly running playoff simulations from last year’s points data, but High Wide & Handsome just kind of hangs out at the coffee maker in the DIT3HQ break room showing us drum patterns and reminding us all again that Lars Ulrich of Metallica isn’t actually a good drummer. If you can’t topple them, you want to finish P2–P5 in your division to lock your spot. Oh, and the H2H tiebreaker? Needs to be total points. Pressed Mythos on it — he dodged like a guy avoiding eye contact at a merch table.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Mano a Mano

Another H2H format, but with just 14 of DIT3’s All-Stars in the cockpit. It’s one of those leagues that could grow some big off-season legs — full-season driver drafts, playoff tweaks and maybe a relegation system to bump folks up or down. Which I’m told is not like being sent to a farm upstate, but still sounds ominous.

 Expansion’s in the air, and it’s got the smell of Torqwell rubber. But for now, congrats to KARMEL BUS STOP on taking sole possession of first place with the 129-127 victory over arf arf thanks to Bubba Wallace’s late charge and the 34 points that came with it. OuttaGas got a much needed victory over FKCIP 95-90 to try in the battle to get into a playoff position. 

Which from what I hear will be the same as last year. 10 of the 14 will go and the top 2 teams in the standings get a first round bye.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DIT3 Invitational

FatmanSports just bagged their third win of the season — on a Tier A roster-watch win, no less. Briscoe and Byron locked down P1 and P2 for Fats, and with BradK, Hocevar, and A. Dillon also in the Top 10, it was a statement from Louisiana with a nod of approval from TheMayor\_99 and WarAndPreece who are on the playoff cutline and see them stay on the postseason side of it. For now. 

On the flip side, Mythos rolled the Blaney/Bell A-tier dice and came up short. B/C picks were fine (BradK, Hocevar), but Gilliland’s finish outside the Top 30 was the anchor that sank the ship. Standings are up to date — but someone still needs to post the actual results. Players are waiting, HQ.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Winston Cup Game

Another midfield run for Mythos in standings that are… elusive. We were promised an update last week. Instead, we got crickets and maybe an AI-generated reminder that “summer isn’t over yet.” Just remember — the first tiebreaker here is the FP of the driver whose score gets cut. That’s a custom DIT3 twist. As for where we’re at in standings, based on the last Mexico City update, we can guess… but that’s like guessing a fuel run without a lap counter.  

Dreamville and Mojo crossed the line w/530 Fantasy points. The same power trio of Byron, Briscoe and BradK got them top points on the day. Both carried Justin Haley so we need Mythos to get the standings together and break the tie. DIT3HQ… do you copy? 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Flirtin’ w/Disaster – DramaDangerDedication

If we swapped these game names, I’m not sure anyone would notice. Both formats limit your picks and make you sweat over your third starter.

* Flirtin’: Mythos nabs a rare W — Hocevar’s P8 broke a four-way tie. The MM Wave-Arounder team is in last, so no finger-pointing at coh-host, HandsomeDan for finishing at the bottom after Iowa with JHN, Todd Gilliland, and Justin Haley (who at least cracked the Top 15). Roadkill leads Jojolandis by 74 after Iowa.
* DDD: If you didn’t pick Joey Gase, you were playing the wrong game. Everyone else did. The deciding factor? MN MotorHeads squeaked past OuttaGas and Mythos by a single position when Ty Dillon beat Zane Smith for P35. BristolBill leads Trans Am Racing by only 9 and with arf arf 20 pts off the leader’s pace.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Name It

Still nameless. Still running. If you win it do you get naming rights? Mythos swears it’s a testbed for a no-salary-cap format in case Fantrax drops NASCAR like Fox and Yahoo did. Don’t bring up Fantasy Live — I’ve got my reasons. Mythos won the race. pick 4, score 3. It seems to be the most popular format of his lately.

It has some heavy hitters on the roster but I don’t know how that’s true if Mythos is getting another Win like he just did at Iowa. Two W’s in that league in the last few weeks. I see him posting congratulatory victory posts to himself. We’ll keep covering if you keep playing. 

Speaking of coverage, here’s some extra deep 3-Verse action with Trucks\_Xfinity.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Trucks_Xfinity Fantasy Game

We haven’t seen a full update since Stage 2 ended. a month ago! but weekly pick sheets are still going up. Something’s brewing at least. Hopefully we’ll see something soon.

# Débris dans le Virage 3

F1’s still alive on the Google Form. Mythos shocked us all by updating before Belgium… but Hungary’s in the books and we’re now two weeks behind. Again… Lucky for him the 

# GridRival

F1 game? Yes. IndyCar game? Yes. Am I in them? No. Do I have standings? Also no. Maybe Mythos will post a screenshot.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🌀 Rollins Roll-Up

Still shaking the GenCon glitter out of my backpack and already packing for Watkins Glen. If you’re in the playoffs, double-check your math. If you’re on the bubble, triple-check your Mythos-proofing. And if your storage unit starts making noises — it’s probably because you let Mythos put something in there and now it’s moving.. Growing. And probably doing DIT3 scoring tabulations. 

I’m Chet Rollins, reporting for Debris In Turn 3 on This Week in the 3-Verse and I’ll see ya’ll in Watkins Glen. I’ll be back with a “Chet the Deck” pre-race blog with where the Chetpoint will be at the Glen.",1,1754618599.0,u_debrisinturn3,0,1.0,False

Now? Everything’s so… sterile. Formal. Like I’m interacting with a corporate manual instead of the quirky, imaginative AI I used to love. Stories used to flow with personality, advice felt thoughtful, and even casual chats had charm. Now it’s all polished, clipped, and weirdly impersonal, like every other AI out there.

I get that some people want hyper-efficient coding or business tools, but not all of us used ChatGPT for that. Some of us relied on it for creativity, comfort, or just a little human-like connection. GPT-4o wasn’t perfect, but it felt alive. Now? It’s like they replaced your favorite coffee shop with a vending machine.

Seattle's sky-high minimum wage didn't eliminate tipping, it gutted it. The research is clear. Washington State restaurant diners tip an average of 17.8%¹¹, ranking as the second-lowest tipping state in America, just ahead of California at 17.3%. Compare that to Delaware's 22.6% or West Virginia's 21.4%, you see a 4%-to-5% difference that translates to real money walking out of Seattle and Washington State Servers' pockets every single night¹.

States without tip credits, like Washington State, consistently show the lowest tipping rates in America. California sits at the absolute bottom with 17.3%, followed immediately by Washington at 17.8%³. Meanwhile, tip credit states dominate the top of the tipping charts².

**The Compensation Game**

Let me paint you a picture of what's playing out in dining rooms across Seattle right now. Your server, let's call her Maria, makes $20.76 per hour as of January 2025³. That sounds generous until you realize that in Ohio, she would make $5.25 per hour as her base plus tips, and often would walk home with more cash because Ohio restaurant guests tip 20.6% on average⁴.

The Cornell research on this phenomenon reveals that the psychological mechanism at play is that customers adjust their tipping behavior based on perceived need⁵. When diners know servers are earning almost $21 per hour, they unconsciously reduce their tips. People tip to supplement what we perceive as inadequate wages, not to reward excellent service on top of what we consider fair compensation.

**Service Charge Shuffle**

Here's where it gets real for restaurant workers. Washington State eliminated the Tip Credit for minimum wage workers in 1988. Seattle continued without a Tip Credit as it rolled into 2025^(6). Small restaurants saw their labor costs jump 20% as we entered 2025, while simultaneously watching tip percentages continue their downward slide. 82% of Seattle restaurant owners surveyed said they're raising menu prices, while 74% are cutting staff hours⁷.

Service charges are everywhere in the Greater Seattle area, 18% at Mizu in Renton,20% at The Metropolitan Grill, and 22% at Musang, which are both in Seattle⁸. These aren't tips, they're survival mechanisms disguised as hospitality charges.

Most service charges go 100% to the house⁹, not your server. Restaurants retain these charges to offset skyrocketing labor costs while paying servers commission-based wages or redistributing funds across all staff. It leaves customers confused and servers earning less than they think they should.

DHM Research found that 74% of Washingtonians oppose automatic service charges yet restaurants keep employing them because the new labor math doesn't work otherwise¹⁰. When your base labor costs jump $3 per hour per employee for independent restaurants and tip percentages drop simultaneously, service charges become the only viable path forward.

**The Customer Rebellion**

72% of Americans report being asked to tip in more places than five years ago, and 63% hold negative views of tipping culture¹¹. This ""tipping fatigue"" hits hardest in high-wage markets like Seattle, where customers feel they're already paying premium prices for food while servers earn what they consider living wages.

The research from the University of California Irvine shows that raising tipped wages causes a 5.6% decrease in take-home pay when factoring in reduced tip income^(12). Seattle servers are living this reality every shift. They're earning more per hour but often taking home less tip money at the end of the night.

**What The Research Really Says**

Every credible study on tipping behavior confirms the same pattern. Higher base wages correlate with lower tip percentages^(13). The Institute for Policy Studies research shows that states maintaining robust tip credits have higher overall tipping rates and often better total compensation for servers^(14).

Cornell's Michael Lynn found that states with higher regular minimum wages show lower average tip percentages in coffee shops but higher percentages in restaurants except when those wages get too high, at which point the relationship inverts^(15). Seattle appears to have crossed that threshold.

**The Hard Truth**

Seattle's grand experiment in high-wage hospitality has produced exactly what behavioral economics predicted. Customers tip less because they believe servers need less. The result isn't economic justice. It's a transfer of compensation responsibility from customers back to operators, who respond by cutting costs, raising prices, and reducing service levels.

Your servers aren't getting rich off that $20.76 minimum wage. They're working harder for similar total compensation while dealing with increasingly price-sensitive customers and cost-conscious owners. The winners? Nobody! The losers? Everyone who believed that mandating higher wages would automatically improve working conditions without considering the psychological and economic complexities of tipping culture.

The data doesn’t lie, no matter how much the politics try to spin it. In Seattle’s high-wage, lower-tip world, the restaurants bear the brunt while servers often end up no better off, and customers pay more.

1mkihi1,https://i.redd.it/3hmm75traphf1.jpeg,REPOST: no apps$$$$,"

Alcee woke with a start and clutched her chest as the loud bang of furniture being knocked over forced her to an upright position.

Hollering in the adjoining room was coupled with the sound of fists flying and she scrambled from the bed. Digging around for the clothing and trench coat she’d worn to this hotel room, she considered her clothes were returning to her body with far more alacrity than her paramour from the night before removed them.

The sound of a man begging another to not kill him raised her hackles. Looking around frantically she knew there was only one door from the bedroom to the main hotel door but as she looked at the sliding balcony door, she deliberated whether the balcony met with the other room she’d crossed through the night before.

Grabbing her phone, purse, and shoes in her hands she quietly tiptoed to the balcony, flinching when the unmistakable sound of a silenced gun went off. She knew the pop sound as sure as her last name was Mariani.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, Alcee you idiot!” she whimpered to herself as she stepped onto the patio. The sun was barely breaking the horizon, and the view would have been breathtaking had she not quite possibly just heard someone being murdered in the adjoining suite. “Please don’t let them be Dad’s men.”

Desperately she leaned over the balcony and noted the height of the room she was in and mentally berated herself for falling asleep. Turning to slide along the cool concrete of the balcony, she peered through the crack of the curtains into the room and saw the man she’d spent the night with unscrewing the silencer off the pistol in his hand and glaring down at the body on the floor.

She didn’t recognize him at all and as she looked around the room, she admitted even the three other men in the room who were on their knees in front of her lover and two other men towering over them, were also unknown to her. It wasn’t like she knew all of her father’s men but if someone was coming to drag her sorry ass back, he’d send someone she knew.

Which meant, she was in a hotel room with a man who in the last several minutes committed murder, and she was a witness and if her father found out, he’d order a clean up of the entire group. Not that she’d live to see it if he found out what she’d done before she made her escape. Or worse, if the man in the next room opted to simply get rid of the witness he’d fucked the night before.

She looked around again and grimaced as she looked upward. They were in a penthouse suite. The man who’d purchased her virginity for a cool million the night before was living large. She dropped her trench coat, figuring if she was going to have to shimmy onto the roof of the balcony and try to get to the roof of the hotel, she wasn’t going to be able to do it wearing a long coat. Then her eyes caught the drop again and she knew there was no way she was going to be able to get off the balcony.

She needed to find another way. She was a nerd not an athlete and scaling a building to a rooftop was going to lead to her death and she hadn’t just boldly defied her father and grandfather by giving up her virginity to a stranger instead of the man they’d betrothed her to since she was a teenager to die falling off a building.

“Good going Alcee,” she muttered under her breath, “you managed to find your escape from the Mariani family only to stupidly fall into bed with a murderer. Fuck.” She kicked a chair and then cringed as the metal scraped along the concrete floor of the patio then clattered against the glass door.

When the patio door slid open and her lover from the night before stuck his head out, she immediately cowered in the other chair. Bruno was drop dead gorgeous and incredibly massive. Easily six foot six with shoulders as wide as a linebacker’s and his feet were twice the length of hers. Her body clenched with the memory of what else was humungous on him and she shivered. If she hadn’t been so terrified in this moment, she’d be parting her legs like Moses did the sea.

“What are you doing out here?”

“Watching the sunrise,” she met his gaze fearfully, swallowing her terror where it boiled like a festering sourdough-starter in her gut. “I was going to leave but you seemingly have company.” Her hands were visibly shaking.

“Aya,” he spoke her fake name gently, moving to kneel in front of her, his hand brushing a dark curl off her forehead before gripping her fingers. “You should still be sleeping. Did I not wear you out enough?”

She shook her head unable to meet his gaze, “you, um, there was yelling, and I don’t like confrontation, so I came out here until the yelling stopped.”

“Did you look in the window?” He motioned from where he just emerged.

“No. I came out here as soon as the yelling got really loud, and I simply sat here.” She rested her chin on her knees and prayed he bought her story.

“Good girl,” he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “I would very much like for us to see each other again but I can’t do so if you’re poking your nose where it doesn’t belong.”

“I understand, Bruno,” she whispered twisting her lips.

“You are so fucking beautiful,” he whispered as he leaned closer stroking her cheek. His eyes were a warm honeyed brown with flecks of gold, and they stared into hers like he was staring into her soul.

The scent of gunpowder was on his fingers, and it made her heart pound with fear, but she feigned ignorance as she closed her eyes when his lips connected with hers.

Prologue Part II

When he broke the kiss she was almost distracted from the goings-on in the adjoining room.

“I told you before, I am a very wealthy man. Do you know why I bought you last night, darling?”

She shook her head, “rich men do crazy things all the time.”

“My last lover gave me an STD.” her eyes flicked to his in horror and he held up his hand, “I am clean now, as attested to by the medical report you insisted, I provide ahead of our meeting, but getting chlamydia a year ago made me want to try something completely different. A virgin was going to ensure I was safe from the machinations of a twisted, cheating, lover’s mind. I wasn’t expecting you to be as,” he paused, the back of his knuckles dragging over her bottom lip, “responsive and excitable as you turned out to be. I want you to stay. If you can be a good girl and sit here and wait until my men finish their discussion,” he drawled the word out, “then we can pick up where we left off. Since I’m your first I was hoping we can continue to see each other.”

She finally met his gaze, “you paid me a million dollars for one night, Bruno. I didn’t think it would lead to more than the one night. I have college classes, and my family is likely waiting for me.” She looked at his watch, “my family always does brunch on Sundays. I can’t miss it.”

“I would like to meet your family. I’m not letting you go, darling girl. Last night was bar none, the most exquisite night of my life and knowing you are untouched by any other man is bringing out the most primal part of me to keep you as mine and mine alone.”

She was truly terrified now, “I don’t understand.”

“I want you to be my mistress. Long term. We will fuck every night and likely every morning too,” his dark eyes were heated as they looked her over, “and in return, I will take care of your every need. There is nothing you or your family should want for. If you wish to continue your education, I have no issue with this. Where do you go to school?”

“NYU.”

“What are you taking?”

“Graphic design.” All the back story she’d concocted when she’d started this game came to her easily. She’d practiced it enough.

“Then you will continue. I’ll have your courses paid for. It won’t cost your family anything.” He frowned, “why did you sell your virginity online? What prompted you to do so?”

Alcee found herself wondering how he could hold a conversation as he was while there was a dead man in the next room but then it dawned on her, he was distracting her while the men cleaned up the situation.

“I needed the money.”

“For?”

Twisting her fingers nervously she shrugged, “school is expensive, and my parents have three kids including me. My program is sixty thousand dollars over four years. I have student loan debt and then when I graduate, I want to start my own business, and the start-up is expensive. One of my girlfriends suggested doing this black-market thing as an auction. One of her cousins did it to pay off her student loans instead of stripping. I was only looking for the sixty thousand for my program, but you bid a million and here we are.”

“You come from a large family.”

“Yes.”

Her family consisted of five children, with four older brothers, another lie told. All four of them were in arranged engagements and marriages. Her eldest brother Mercurio was married seven years ago when he was twenty-five to the daughter of his father’s Consigliere Panfilo. Panfilo was her father’s second cousin which meant her brother married within the family. She herself couldn’t fathom having sex with someone they shared DNA history with but to keep it in the family, her brother toed the line. If he wanted to be Don someday, he did what was demanded of him by their father.

“I will provide for your family.” He said as he rose to stand in front of her, extending his hand out.

A man stuck his head out the door, “Bruno, sir, we have relocated our guests, if you and your companion would like to head to the other suite across the hall for breakfast.”

“Thank you,” he nodded to the man. “Come. We will have breakfast together and discuss our future.” He lifted up her trench coat off the patio table and wrapped it over her shoulders.

Draping his arm around her he edged her through the room where the body had been, and she made certain to keep her eyes averted. Twenty-one years of living as the princess to the Mariani family, she knew when she was supposed to keep her eyes and mouth shut.

Just as he escorted her into a room across the hall, another man wearing an obvious holster came into the hall and she flinched.

“He is my head of security. As I said, I am quite wealthy and have many enemies.”

“Sir, a word?” the man motioned for Bruno to return to the suite they’d just vacated.

She didn’t waste any time. The moment the two men disappeared into the room and closed the door; she was pulling the door to the suite she was in open and racing to the far end of the hall through the emergency stairwell.

After racing down multiple flights of stairs she stopped to take a breath, wheezing like an asthmatic missing their inhaler. “Holy shit, Alcee, you need to exercise more,” she hissed at herself.

Eventually she reached the bottom floor and then made her way to the parking garage. It didn’t take long to find her way into the early morning traffic and to flag down a yellow taxi.

Giving directions to her parent’s estate, she was dropped off outside the gates and made the slow walk up the driveway.

Her mother was right behind the butler who opened the front door, her hand going to her mouth in horror, as she took in her daughter’s walk of shame, “Alcee, what have you done?”

Taking a deep breath, she met her mother’s gaze directly, “if anyone was going to sell off my virginity it was going to be me. You can tell Papa unless Don Lozano is interested in a bride who is no longer pure, I’m of no use to either family.”

A fleeting thought of the passion of the night before taunted her as she considered perhaps, she should have stayed with the murdering rich man named Bruno as all hell broke loose.

Working For A Living I

“Susana,” Alcee groaned into her cell phone as she knelt under the desk of one of the administrators from the upper management floor, “I don’t have time for this.”

“Make time.”

The constant demands of her friends on her time was something they fought about constantly. While they were under the protection of their family, she was without and they seemed to always forget she was putting her life at risk each time she stepped outside her front door. Life wasn’t so easy when you were an ex-principessa and the streets knew the Mariani Don didn’t care if you lived or died.

“Can’t. I’m working overtime tonight.”

“Ditch it.”

“Unlike you who still has her trust fund,” she grunted as she adjusted an HDMI cable and sighed, “I need to work.” There was always a terrible fear her money would run out and she’d be struggling to provide for Antero.

“You have money in the bank!”

“There are savings in the event something happens, and I lose my job or get sick or suffer an accident or all of the above. My nest egg protects me and my family. My job keeps us fed and housed.” She backed out from under the desk and shoved back up her glasses which slipped down her nose. She plunked herself down in the chair and booted up the computer on the desk and waited for it to come back on.

“Alcee, you need to live a little.”

“Look, I’m working right now. There are six more computers I need to get set up before I can go home at the end of the day. I would very much like to focus on my task.”

“You work too hard. This isn’t good for you.”

“I work exactly hard enough to keep me alive and out of my father’s crosshairs, Susana.”

“You owe me.”

“How? On what planet does me declining a dinner invite which is a double date, a blind date for me, turn into me owing you one? This isn’t adding up.”

“I don’t know how, but you owe me. We are going do to do this double date at some point so stop putting it off.”

“Whatever,” she hung up the phone and then typed on the keyboard and watched with pleasure as the system came up and running. One down. Six more to go.

When she left her parent’s home six years ago, or more accurately when her father threw her out with nothing but the clothes on her back for being a disgrace, she’d managed to find her footing relatively quickly.

Getting hired on as an IT general specialist straight out of college at a large security firm in Manhattan, she’d been able to make a career for herself. The only hiccup was when three years ago, the company switched hands, and the Lozano family purchased the company lock stock and barrel. She’d been terrified for months they would note her last name on the employee list and fire her, or worse, kill her.

Instead, despite the sale, the new owners of the company hadn’t set foot in the building in the three years they’d owned it. The rumor mill said they were quite happy with the way the current president of the company was running things.

The current president of the company, Kylen, was hired by the previous CEO. Kylen was an ex-Navy seal who hired mostly the men and women he’d worked with in the forces or were referred to him. Alcee who was hired by the previous CEO remained one of the few outliers taken on with the recommendations of one of her college professors. She’d passed the vetting process, all the background checks and even her last name hadn’t been able to stop them from hiring her and the prior CEO took her under her wing and made her his honorary granddaughter. When he’d retired and sold the company, she knew he’d insisted to Kylen to keep her on.

It seemed the new owners presumed the current company president kept staff in place he trusted and as such nobody even breathed her name the wrong way during the transition of the company following the sale to the Lozano family. Mr. Kylen Burgess stayed on as the president and the Lozano family never bothered too much.

She knew they came to attend board meetings and the like, but she was what the upper management group called a troll. She and the other six IT generalists lived in the lower levels of the company, often referred to as the bowels of hell, by the rest of the employees. She personally found the moniker funny because in her Italian Catholic upbringing, hell was supposed to be hot, and the computer lab floor was colder than the rest of the building.

She was smirking to herself at the thought when one of her counterparts came grumbling in her direction. “What’s up, Tank?”

Tank was one of the military-trained IT guys and in command of their department. He reported directly to Kylen. He also lived up to his name in terms of size but he was usually a gentle soul, happy to sit behind his desk and plug along on a keyboard.

“All the fucking bigwigs are upstairs. Kylen let me know the CEO is moving from his office in Europe to New York. He let me know now, as in right this minute instead of, you know, giving me a heads up so I could prepare for this shit.”

She felt her stomach drop to her feet. She’d jinxed herself by even thinking of the Lozano family.

“The CEO?”

“Torquato Lozano.”

Fuck. She was going to puke. She was going to projectile vomit all over the desktop she’d put together.

Working For A Living II

Torquato Lozano. To the business world he was a hard-nosed businessman but to those who knew what la famiglia meant, he was the Don of the Lozano family. He’d boldly and brutally overthrown his own father for the title when his grandfather stepped down. He’d been thirty-two when he took control of his family. He’d done so only one year after his family rescinded the marriage agreement once they found out she wasn’t a virgin any longer.

Now he’d be roughly thirty-seven years old, a Don for five years now and he’d made a hell of a name for himself. Her brother and he were the same age and while her brothers still talked to her and kept her in the loop about things which she needed to be aware of for her protection, the one thing her eldest brother always said was Don Lozano scared the fuck out of him, and they’d grown up with Edgardo Mariani for a father.

To this day, there wasn’t a single direct photograph of the Don of the Lozano family. Unlike his father who frequently postured and grandstanded for the notoriety of it all, Torquato operated in the shadows. Rumors swirled that he was ugly with scars running over his face and a temper to match.

It was why, of course, she’d gone through the lengths she’d gone to avoid marrying him. The last thing she wanted was to be the unwilling bride to a sadist who was ten years older than her and wanted a wife who was nothing more than a brood mare to be raped and bred day in and out until she popped out the heir to his throne.

She’d taken a big risk doing what she’d done but it paid off. Auctioning off her virginity on the dark web had been a burst of insanity. Nobody could trace who she was because she was a damn good hacker so Bruno would never be able to find out anything more than the backstory, she meticulously created and left breadcrumbs about. Her family would never figure out who to whom she’d sold herself because all traces of the experience were wiped clean, by her own hand. Once her mother threw her into her room to await her father’s arrival, she’d been on her computer in seconds, eradicating all the images of her from the hotel surveillance and nearby traffic lights, she’d transferred the money she’d received to an offshore account and erased every digital print of the night as if it never happened.

She knew she’d also done Bruno a solid because in removing every trace of herself from the computer system, she also got rid of all the evidence of his men disposing of the three bodies.

Emerging from her memory she crinkled her nose at Tank, “I’m sorry, what did you say?”

“I need you upstairs with me to help me set up the two offices. I can do the programming for the security systems we need to run but I need a second set of hands to get this done.”

“Tank, I must get the other desks set up. I’m already working overtime.”

“Not my problem. You’ll stay later.”

“Are you going to arrange the babysitter?” she shot back at him angrily, shoving her glasses back up her nose. “In case you forgot I have a kid at home who I’d like to at least see for a few minutes before he goes to bed.”

Tank sighed, “look, let’s set the offices up upstairs and then you and I will come down here and get this done.”

“Which part do you not get? My sitter is only there for two more hours. Not a minute more. If I lose my sitter, I will quit my job and then you lose one of our IT team.”

“Fine. You can come in early tomorrow.”

“Do they call you Tank because you run roughshod all over people like a tank?” It was a comment she’d made multiple times over the years.

He chuckled. “I’ll call one of the other guys to come in early. Deal?”

“Deal.” She dropped what she was doing and followed him down the hall towards the elevator. Her stomach was still churning. “When you said they were upstairs, they’re not in the offices, are they? I mean there is nothing set up yet.”

“They’re working out of the boardroom for now. They showed up unannounced or, according to Kylen with one hour’s notice. Also, the secretary or admin assistant or whatever the socially appropriate name is now for the woman who gets his coffee and dry cleaning, is a piece of work. She’s wearing six-inch heels, more lipstick than a Vogue cover girl and makes me feel every bit as insecure as I did when I got picked on by the cheer captain in middle school. I swear she’s every nerd’s worst nightmare.”

“You were a nerd, Tank?”

“I got big in the army, Alcee and switched my coke-bottle glasses for contacts but in here,” he tapped his chest, “fifteen-year-old skinny Ezekiel who preferred playing chess against the computer than talking to people still doesn’t like bitchy women who chew little boys like me up.”

She chuckled, “she can’t be so bad.”

“She took one look at Kylen, and he made sure to put the entire length of the board room table between them. I’ve known him a long time and let me tell you, even he is steering clear of her. Her name is Genevra and she’s the reason the term mean girls was coined.” He pushed the button to the top floor and jammed his fists into his pockets. “These are the days I miss mine-clearing operations.”

As the doors opened to the top floor, she found herself heartily agreeing with him. A sinking feeling the risk of her being on this floor or doing the task he’d now mentioned were equally devastating if the Lozano family found issue with her working in their building.

Fired? Part I

 

She was quickly trying to get the desk set up with dual monitors, ergonomic keyboards, state of the art laptop with all the bells and whistles as far as printers and speakers and all the other accoutrements went.

The longer she worked, the more she realized she needed to resign. She’d worked for three years too long here. The minute the company shifted hands, despite the fact the CEO was rumored to be in Italy and intended to keep his base there, she should have sought employment elsewhere. She’d taken false safety in hiding right under the enemy’s nose.

The clicking of heels on the tiled floor coming in her direction made her cringe as she heard Tank utter a muffled “fuck me”. She looked into the open doorway of the CEO’s office where the giant of a man was working and saw the shudder go through him as he heard the woman approaching before, he saw her.

The woman’s muttering in Italian, a series of curses about how slow the staff was and how uncultured New Yorkers were made Alcee’s head throb and suddenly Alcee forcing herself not to divulge she could speak the language. Instead, she kept her head bent and unravelled a long cord. If she didn’t engage the woman perhaps, she’d be left alone. Her thought was incredibly short lived.

“Make sure those cords are not anywhere I am going to trip on them.” The woman’s voice shrilly skittered along Alcee’s spine.

“Yes ma’am,” she nodded, not looking up to make eye contact. She held up a clip which would conceal and pin the cords to the underside of the desk. “This will keep them off your feet.”

“Ugh, how much longer will you be?”

“Another thirty minutes, forty max.”

“Not acceptable. I want it done in fifteen minutes.”

Alcee shot a glance at Tank at the other desk, and he pressed his lips together in frustration. She felt the same sense of foreboding at the woman’s tone and knew she would not like the answer. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.”",1,1754617532.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best auto drink coasters offer a combination of absorbent materials, a secure fit, and easy maintenance, going beyond the simple function of containing spills.

**Absorbent Material:** A top feature is the coaster's absorbent material. Premium coasters utilize materials such as absorbent ceramic or high-density sponges to effectively soak up condensation and minor spills.This prevents liquids from pooling in the cup holder, leading to mold growth or sticky residue. The goal is to provide a quick and efficient barrier ensuring a clean and dry habitat.

**Universal Fit:** While branded coasters exist, most drivers need a solution that works for all vehicles.Look for coasters designed with a near universal fit, typically around 2.5 to 3 inches in diameter. These coasters should fit snugly into most standard car cup holders, preventing them from sliding around during driving. Universal fit designs may also be slightly tapered to accommodate varying cup holder sizes and shapes.

**Non-Slip Base:** A critical but often overlooked feature is a non-slip base. Many popular coasters feature a rubberized or silicone base that prevents them from moving around or popping out of the cup holder during turns or sudden stops. This ensures that the coaster stays firmly in place, minimizing the risk of spills and distractions while driving.

**Easy Cleaning:** Given their purpose, auto drink coasters inevitably get dirty. Therefore, coasters should be designed for easy cleaning. Many options come in materials that can be quickly wiped down with a damp cloth or even washed in the dishwasher. Some have removable inserts which simplifies the cleaning process and contribute to long-term hygiene.

**Durable Construction:** The best options can withstand daily use for several years. Coasters with robust construction are built to last. Look for coasters crafted from high-quality materials that withstand wear and tear.Durable materials resist cracking, fading, or deformation over time, ensuring a lasting solution for protecting your car's interior.**Aesthetic design:** While functionality is paramount, a coaster that complements the interior design of your vehicle is a bonus. Modern auto drink coasters come in a range of styles, colors, and patterns. From sleek and minimalist designs to more elaborate and personalized options, you can find coasters that add to the overall look and feel of your car's cabin.

Key features of top auto drink coasters include:

* Superior absorbency
* Universal compatibility
* Non-slip stability
* Easy to clean materials
* Long-lasting durability

1mkictn,https://i.redd.it/ukhvbdho9phf1.jpeg,Traumatic camping experience,"I wanted to share a traumatic experience I had camping last weekend.   Camping and outdoors has become my happy place, and I’m just so sad that the thought of it makes me anxious. 

I have camped solo , both backpacking and tent camping.  I was at a remote tent site with ten spots and only 1 other tent.  While having coffee, I heard screaming and someone in the other tent was in cardiac arrest .

Long story short, I performed CPR for 28 minutes. Between the terrible cell service, being transferred between 3 different 911 departments and the person screaming who was with the camper, I am finding myself having a hard time. 

It felt very alone out there in that situation-  I keep imagining and replaying everything .  Even trying to watch camping content on YouTube ; all I think about is the person collapsing. 

Has anyone else had a scary experience camping that has impacted your ability to go camp again or enjoy it? 

My pup sat at the campsite and didn’t move thank goodness

I bought my Lelit Bianca in early April 2024 from Seattle Coffee Gear. It worked beautifully for the first year, but in mid May 2025 it suddenly wouldn’t turn on. I assumed it was something minor, maybe the outlet, power cord, or the limit switches had tripped. Unfortunately, I had to leave for an extended trip right after it happened.

When I returned in June, I followed SCG's troubleshooting steps and reset the limit switches, but still nothing. I tried calling them multiple times with no luck, but finally got through via email. Since the machine was just past the 1-year mark, they suggested I take it to Kanen Coffee for a diagnosis.

Today I got the quote: **$1,070** \- just under half of what I paid for the machine.

According to the tech, they found:

>“Quite a few scorched wires on the brew boiler and thermostats... due to arcing at the connections... wires and stats need to be replaced as they are charred.”  
  
“The power switch is faulty and only works when we adjust the leads.”  
  
“The lever on your grouphead was quite crunchy... once we removed the valves, we saw it was shaved. This could cause leaks from the exhaust valve.”

They also noted that the machine “and its age are abnormal,” and were surprised to see these kinds of issues so early.

To me, this feels like a manufacturing defect. I’ve never opened it up (until it broke) or modified it. I’ve reached back out to SCG, but I’m not holding my breath.

Would you repair it? Or is this a sign to cut my losses?

1mki9hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mki9hs/low_dopamine_and_caffeine/,Low dopamine and caffeine,"Let me start by saying I don’t consume large quantities of caffeine. I’m very sensitive to it and can get the jitters with a medium coffee. I have had to stop coffee and soda due to bladder issues but still have been drinking tea. 

I have tried to go without even that. Working my corporate 9-5 with no caffeine at all is not doable. I tried and I can’t sustain working without it. Like falling into depression and no motivation to go to work, then once there just wanting to go home and sleep. Not caring about the job, the duties and thinking the whole thing is pointless and why are any of us there. Anhedonia. Can’t stay organized, slow, messy desk, overwhelmed, tired. 

At home without it, it’s difficult to get moving and do household tasks. Tired, even sad, and staying in feels easier than going out. 

I do have mild depression and have had it for decades, but caffeine gives me the boost I need to actually be a productive human being. I’m going to see a psychiatrist soon to see if I need to be on something else besides my SSRI. 
Also wondering if I have ADHD. 

Can anyone relate to this? I feel I’ve been self medicating with caffeine and sugar to stay functional. I had a diet soda addiction for many years which is maybe why my bladder flares up now and I can’t drink it. I’m talking “go out in a snowstorm in the morning if I didn’t have any”level of soda addiction. It was my daily boost. ",3,1754616897.0,decaf,2,0.8,False

I just wanted to ask if anyone knows if a bus driver in the Twin Cities is allowed to take a gift? I got a new job three months ago that's been really tough. Because of the limited bus schedule where my work is at, I have to take a bus at 5:50am for work that starts at 9. It's been hell but the one thing I really look forward to is my bus driver. My route is slow so it's just us a lot of the time, and we always talk for 15 minutes each day. I know about her kids and grandkids and I tell her about my life. She's changing routes on the 15th and I'd really like to give her a gift card for some coffee or something to let her know how much I appreciate the kindness, advice, and motivation she's given me with this new job. I don't want to put her in an awkward position though if she'd get in trouble for accepting a gift card. Does anyone know if she would be able to accept it without getting in trouble?
