I'm F20 and just hoping to meet some new people to talk to and maybe build a genuine friendship. I love casual convos over coffee (virtual or in real life), sharing random stories, and sending each other funny memes or thoughts throughout the day. I'm pretty easygoing and always up for good vibes, lighthearted chats, or even deeper convos if we click.

Whether it's talking about favorite shows, weekend plans, or just how the day's been going, I’m always happy to keep the conversation flowing. I’m also a fan of spontaneous ideas, like going for a walk just to grab a snack or making a playlist together for fun.

If you’re someone who’s friendly, chill, and open to making a new connection, feel free to say hi! I don’t expect anything serious—just good energy and someone who enjoys talking as much as I do. Let’s see where it goes!",2,1752560347.0,makingfriends,0,1.0,False
1m0aax7,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1m0aax7/a_bit_confused_by_trade/,A bit confused by trade,"Knowing well that new big patches like 1.9 would break the game, i decided to let it cook for a while to have most of the bugs solved before diving in.

As my first game in 1.9 i wanted to try some small-ish nation and focus on playing tall and fiddle with the new trading system to get a grasp on it, so i picked Portugal and engaged in absolutely 0 wars.

I randomly picked 2 companies that produced prestige goods not yet on the world market: coffee and groceries (in hindsight, they're pretty meh, but it's not the point), and to get in the top 3 producers i subsidized exports and it's all cool till now. But then, as soon as i stopped subsidizing exports, even if my prestige goods are dirt cheap and could potentially flood the world market, they're not exported (i had free trade to boost trade advantage as well); with subsidies i was exporting an unholy amount of prestige groceries to qing, having a treaty port since the beginning, but without subsidies it istantly stops.

Trade advantage is indeed what confuses me the most, i've read the tooltips and watched some video to understand it, but as a small nation outside a power block it feels quite hard relying on trade, because if i'm not mistaken, you need strategic interests all over the world (big ass fleet needed) and trade privilege treaties (which are quite hard to obtain) to compete in the world market (""compete"" it's not the right word, as you don't even get to do any trade without subsidizing import/exports, hell, i spent a shitton of money in import subsidies to get wood and iron even with interests in russia and sweden with trade privilege, and wood was still +50% base price in 1880).

So, what am i doing wrong? am i missing something? i'd like some tips to master trade, as i'm kinda lost.",1,1752560346.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

Advice needed from anyone who's survived this beast.","Hi. I’m a rising senior, premed, drowning in coffee and cortisol.

I've been trying to study for the MCAT on and off for a few months now. Keyword: trying. I have a decent grasp on the content, but every time I sit down to review or do practice questions, I spiral into a black hole of imposter syndrome

Some context:

* I’ve finished all my prereqs.
* I’m averaging \~500 on FLs (best so far is a 502).
* My dream schools aren’t T20, but I still want to be competitive.
* I’ve got clinical experience, research, and decent ECs.
* I'm scheduled to take the MCAT in \[insert upcoming test date\], but I don’t know if I should just push it to next year and take a glide year instead.

Here’s the war going on in my brain:**A. Take it.** Just do it. Rip the band-aid off. Maybe you’ll surprise yourself. At worst, you retake. At best, you never have to look at amino acids again.**B. Wait.** You’ll burn out and waste your only good shot. Take more time, prep properly, and apply stronger next cycle.

I guess what I’m asking is:

* How did *you* know you were ready?
* Has anyone taken it at a 500-ish FL and ended up okay?
* What do you *wish* someone told you before you scheduled your test?
* Am I screwing myself over if I wait another year to apply?

I just want to be a doctor.

Please send advice. Or memes. Or a sign from the universe.

>Repair Cafés are free meeting places and they’re all about repairing things (together). In the place where a Repair Café is located, you’ll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need. On clothes, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, crockery, appliances, toys, et cetera. You’ll also find expert volunteers, with repair skills in all kinds of fields.

>Visitors bring their broken items from home. Together with the specialists they start making their repairs in the Repair Café. It’s an ongoing learning process. If you have nothing to repair, you can enjoy a cup of tea or coffee. Or you can lend a hand with someone else’s repair job. You can also get inspired at the reading table – by leafing through books on repairs and DIY.

Since we can't afford new things repairs where possible can be a godsend to fix something we can't afford to replace.

I imagined my graduation marking a bright new chapter—achievement, celebration, love. But instead of standing beside me, Caleb, the man I trusted most, spent the day in the arms of someone he once called ""just a friend.""



Shattered, I wandered into a bar, desperate for escape. I never expected that night to end in darkness—my drink tampered with, my body violated, my voice ignored. And with that horror, I lost a life I hadn’t yet told him about: our unborn child.



The hospital walls couldn’t contain the truth. A live stream revealed it all—Caleb’s betrayal, Bianca’s smug smile, their mockery of my pain. The life I thought I had with him? It was a lie.



He used to say I’d fall apart without him.



But this time, I’m walking away—not broken, but rebuilding. And I won’t be looking back.



\--



The hospital ceiling above me was blank—white, cold, unforgiving. I lay there, aching from the inside out, a thousand invisible cracks spider-webbed through every part of me. My physical wounds were painful, yes—but they were nothing compared to the weight pressing down on my chest, the kind that made it hard to even breathe.



For a while, I stared at the empty chair beside me, waiting—naively—for Caleb to walk through that door. I imagined his arms wrapping around me, his voice trembling as he asked if I was okay. But he never came. He wasn’t coming.



I tried to call him. The line rang, over and over, but he didn’t pick up. A piece of me still hoped he didn’t know what had happened, that maybe—just maybe—he’d come running once he did. But when I opened my secret Instagram account and saw the live video, any sliver of hope I had left turned to ash.



There he was. My boyfriend of over a year. Holding Bianca like she was his prize. She smiled with smug satisfaction, draped across him as if she’d won.



And maybe she had.



“Hey, Caleb,” someone behind the camera laughed. “What would your girl think if she saw this?”



“She’d believe whatever I told her,” he replied with a lazy smirk. “She always does.”



I felt the betrayal physically. My stomach twisted, and my vision blurred as the phone slipped from my hand.



Just last night, I was fighting for my life. I had gone to a bar alone—broken and humiliated because Caleb ditched my graduation celebration. I drank to forget, unaware someone had spiked my drink. By the time I realized, it was too late. The men dragged me away like I was nothing more than a forgotten possession.



My body had failed me. I had screamed in my mind, but no words would come. I managed to call Caleb, desperate for help.



""Help me,"" I had whispered.



He didn’t believe me. He didn’t even hesitate.



""Stop pretending,” he said. “You’re just upset I wasn’t there.”



Then came Bianca’s voice—seductive, cruel. “Should I take off the lingerie now?” she teased.



And that was it. The call ended. I was left alone, surrounded by monsters, deprived of power and dignity.



But the worst part wasn’t even the physical violation. It was what I lost that night—something no one knew about yet. I had been carrying a secret inside me, a new life. I was going to tell Caleb after graduation. I had imagined him smiling, holding me, whispering promises for our future. But that moment never came.



Instead, I lost the baby I had barely begun to love.



I lay in a cold, unfamiliar field afterward, blood-soaked and broken, and thought I might die. Maybe I wanted to.



But I didn’t. I woke up. I survived.



And as I stared at that empty chair in the hospital, I realized something: I couldn’t keep waiting for someone who had already chosen to leave.



So I picked up the phone again. This time, with purpose.



“Mom,” I said.



“Rhea? Sweetheart, are you okay?”



“I’m going to take the job in Sydney. Please help me get out of here.”



It was the beginning of the end—and the start of something new.



I wasn’t going to waste another minute on Caleb or the dream I used to cling to. I would rebuild myself, piece by piece, no matter how long it took.



Because he had abandoned me at my lowest.



But I?



I would rise.



Chapter 2



My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, even as I curled tighter beneath the hospital blanket. Every time I closed my eyes, the memories stormed back like a flood I couldn’t contain—the cruel chuckles, the rough hands, the helplessness pressing down on me until I could barely breathe. I gripped the edge of the sheet, forcing air into my lungs, trying to steady myself. I kept whispering in my head, You’re okay. You’re safe now. But it didn’t feel true.



I was surviving, but I wasn’t really living. I was still alone in this fight.



At some point, exhaustion must have pulled me under. When I opened my eyes again, it wasn’t because of a nightmare—it was because someone was touching me.



Fear shot through my veins like ice. My muscles tensed, and before I could think, I shoved the hand away with every ounce of strength I had.



“Whoa! Rhea, it’s me—it’s just me,” a voice said quickly.



My vision adjusted to the low light, and I saw him standing there—Caleb. His expression was one of confusion and mild concern, as if I’d simply woken up from a bad dream.



“Babe, are you okay? You looked terrified.”



His voice. That voice I used to run to for comfort now made my skin crawl. After everything I had been through—after the night I begged him to help me, sobbing through the phone—and he dismissed me as if I were acting dramatic… How dare he show up now, pretending like nothing had happened?



“What are you doing here?” I asked, my voice cold and raw, laced with disbelief.



He gave me a casual smile and held up a plastic bag. “I just got back. Thought I’d surprise you. Got a few things for you—souvenirs and stuff.”



I turned my back on him without a word, bile rising in my throat. His presence alone felt like poison.



His tone changed, sharp and defensive. “What the heck is your problem? Are you seriously still mad I missed your graduation? You’re being ridiculous.”



I clenched the blanket so hard my knuckles turned white.



“This is about Bianca again, isn’t it?” he added with a huff, already rolling his eyes.



I said nothing, trying to hold myself together.



He winced and ran a hand through his hair. “Rhea, for God’s sake. She’s a client. A business contact. Why are you always so insecure?”



That was it.



I turned to him slowly, my voice trembling with fury. “You think this is about jealousy? About graduation?”



He opened his mouth, but I didn’t let him speak.



“They tied me up, Caleb. They beat me until I couldn’t scream anymore. They laughed while I cried and begged. And where were you?” My voice cracked. “I called you. I begged you.”



His expression flickered, maybe with guilt—maybe just annoyance. I couldn’t tell.



Before he could say anything, his phone buzzed.



He answered immediately. “Bianca?” he said, his voice softening, filled with concern.



Of course.



He listened for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, I’ll come now. Don’t worry. I’m on my way.”



He ended the call and turned to me with urgency.



“Bianca’s in the hospital,” he said. “She needs me.”



I stared at him, stunned. “And I don’t?” I whispered, barely audible.



“She’s not well,” he said flatly. “You’re strong. You’ll be fine.”



I laughed bitterly, though it came out as a broken sound. “I was attacked. I’m bleeding on the inside, Caleb.”



“She’s like a sister,” he said, exasperated. “Why do you always twist everything? You say you love me—so act like it. Understand that sometimes other people need me too.”



That was the moment something inside me snapped.



“No,” I said, stepping away from him. “Loving you means breaking myself into pieces to make you whole. I’m done.”



I didn’t wait for his reply. I grabbed my phone, my hands still trembling, and stormed out. My feet carried me to the nearest bathroom. I slammed the door shut and collapsed onto the floor, pressing a towel to my face to muffle the sobs that burst from my chest. Tears streamed down my face, hot and endless, soaking the towel as I cried like something inside me had died.



Because maybe it had.



There were no words left to say to Caleb. No strength left to argue, to explain, to beg him to care.



Then my phone buzzed again.



It was my mom.



“Rhea?” she said gently, “I’ve made all the arrangements. Everything’s set. You’re going to Sydney, just like we talked about.”



I wiped at my tears, trying to breathe. “I don’t know if I can go through with it…”



Her voice was soothing but firm. “You have to, honey. You need a fresh start. And you won’t be alone. Jasper will be waiting for you. He’s going to help you settle in.”



“Jasper?” I asked, frowning slightly. The name tugged at a distant part of my memory.



“Your childhood friend. You used to build sandcastles together every summer, remember? He offered to help when I told him what happened. He’s a good man, Rhea. And he’ll look out for you.”



I hesitated. Leaving meant closing a chapter I wasn’t ready to let go of. Not entirely.



“Honey,” she added softly, “the authorities are investigating. We’re going to catch the men who did this to you. You’re not alone in this anymore. They’ll face justice. I promise you.”



Her words cracked something inside me—not from pain this time, but from resolve. I wasn’t just leaving to run away. I was choosing to survive. And more than that—I was choosing to heal.



“Thanks, Mom,” I whispered. “Really.”



As I ended the call, my gaze drifted to the window. Beyond it was the city where I had lost so much—my innocence, my trust, my future with Caleb. But now, I had the chance to start over. A chance to rebuild.



And somewhere deep in my soul, anger began to harden into something stronger—determination.



Caleb hadn’t just ignored me. He had minimized my pain, invalidated my trauma, and walked away when I needed him most. He had made me feel like nothing.



But I wasn’t nothing.



I wasn’t powerless.



I stood up, wiped the last of my tears, and walked out with a newfound clarity. My suitcase waited quietly in the corner. I began packing—deliberately, forcefully. Clothes, documents, pieces of a past I was finally ready to leave behind.



I was leaving in three days.



And when I left, I wouldn’t look back.



Not at Caleb.



Not at the pain.



Not at the shattered girl who once waited for a man who would never choose her.



This time, I was choosing me.



Chapter 3



My fingers trembled slightly as I closed the final zipper on my luggage. The police had contacted me earlier in the morning—they had apprehended one of the men involved in my assault. The moment I heard the news, a knot formed in my stomach. The thought of facing it all over again—of confronting that night—made my skin crawl. But deep down, I knew I couldn’t run from it. Not anymore. I had to face the past, even if it meant reliving my worst nightmare. I couldn’t let fear define me any longer.



I was just about to walk out the front door when it flew open with a thud. Caleb stormed into the room, his expression stormy and volatile.



“Where are you going?” He barked, eyes narrowing on me.



I adjusted my bag on my shoulder, refusing to meet his gaze. I didn’t owe him an explanation—not after everything he’d done.



“Oh, I get it,” he sneered. “You’re off to meet your boyfriend, right? You’ve been sneaking around, haven’t you?”



His words made me stop in my tracks. I turned toward him, my brows furrowed. “What are you talking about, Caleb?”



With a twisted smirk, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a thick set of photographs. He tossed them dramatically onto the floor between us, the glossy images fanning out in every direction.



I looked down—and froze.



There I was, sprawled on a bed, unclothed and unconscious. The photos were taken from angles that made my stomach lurch with disgust and horror. My breath caught in my throat as the realization hit me: they were from that night. The night I had been drugged and violated.



“Where did you get these?” I demanded, my voice trembling as my eyes remained locked on the images.



Caleb’s voice turned cruel. “Does it really matter? The truth is right in front of me—you betrayed me.”



I took a step back, the sheer weight of his accusation making my chest tighten. “Betrayed you?” I asked. “I didn’t betray anyone! I was assaulted, Caleb! I was drugged, deprived of my dignity, and tortured—don’t you get it?”



He shook his head stubbornly, his eyes cold and unyielding. “Save the lies. Bianca told me everything.”



I gave a bitter, disbelieving laugh. “Of course she did. Because whatever Bianca says must be gospel to you.”



“She’s not a liar,” he snapped. “She was devastated when she found out. She only told me because she thought I had a right to know the truth.”



The air around me felt suffocating. I was exhausted—mentally, emotionally, physically—from constantly defending myself, from being weighed down by his blind loyalty to the one woman who had manipulated everything.



“You know what, Caleb?” I said quietly but firmly, locking eyes with him. “I’m done justifying myself to someone who refuses to hear me.”



I turned to leave, my fingers tightening around the handle of my bag. But before I could take another step, Caleb’s hand shot out and grabbed my arm, his grip bruising.



“You’re not walking away from me,” he growled.



“Let go of me!” I cried out, yanking my arm, but his hold only tightened.



The next thing I knew, pain exploded across my cheek. His hand had struck me—hard. I stumbled backward, stunned. My face throbbed, my vision swimming with disbelief. He had hit me.



For a moment, the room was dead silent.



Then I slowly raised my head, my entire body trembling—not from fear this time, but from rage.



“I can’t believe you just did that,” I whispered, voice raw.



He stood there, chest heaving, eyes wild.



“This is it, Caleb,” I said, my voice rising with fury. “You want to believe Bianca? Fine. You want to think I’m the villain? Be my guest. But I’m done being your punching bag—literally and figuratively.”



Without thinking, I lifted my hand and slapped him across the face. The sharp crack echoed through the house.



“I’m leaving,” I declared, fire burning in my chest. “And there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”



As if summoned by our chaos, the door creaked open again. Bianca stepped in, looking every bit the part of a concerned, delicate flower.



“What’s happening?” she asked, voice laced with false innocence. “Is this about me?”



I glared at her, my patience obliterated.



“I didn’t mean to cause any trouble,” she continued softly, her voice trembling like she was about to cry. “I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. When I saw those pictures… I was broken. You’re like a brother to me, Caleb. I just wanted to protect you.”



I could barely contain the fury rising in me. My fists clenched at my sides, my nails digging into my palms.



“You liar,” I spat, stepping toward her. “You’ve been the one tearing us apart. You’ve been the one crawling into his bed behind my back.”



Her eyes widened, a flicker of real fear flashing through her carefully constructed facade.



“Don’t act like the victim now, Bianca,” I continued, my voice shaking with emotion. “You manipulated him. You fed him lies while playing the perfect little innocent. But I see through you now. And I’m done pretending.”



Chapter 4



Bianca burst into loud, dramatic sobs the moment my hand connected with her cheek. She clutched her face like I had committed some horrific crime, her cries echoing through the room.



Caleb immediately pushed past me and stepped protectively in front of her, glaring at me with fire in his eyes. Without warning, he shoved me backward, hard enough to make me stumble.



“What on earth is wrong with you?” he shouted. “She just got discharged from the hospital, and you think hitting her is okay?”



I steadied myself, rage burning in my veins as I stood tall again. “Of course,” I said bitterly, staring him down. “Of course you’re defending her—like always. That’s all you’ve ever done. You know what, Caleb? I’m done playing this game. If she’s what you want, go be with her. I’m finished with you. We're done.”



“No,” he said instantly, his voice shaking with disbelief. “You don’t get to leave me. You’re not walking away from this.”



I let out a laugh—sharp and humorless. “No, Caleb. You’re the one who can’t survive without me. And soon, you’ll understand exactly what that means.”



I turned toward the door, lifting my bag onto my shoulder, ready to leave it all behind.



But before I could step out, I heard his voice behind me—calm, casual, like this was just another day. “Relax, Bianca. She’ll come crawling back like she always does. She’s just throwing another tantrum.”



That cut deeper than anything he’d ever done.



For a second, I stood there in silence, the weight of his words pressing down on me like stones. I remembered all the times I’d gotten angry at him—hurt by his indifference, his gaslighting—only to end up apologizing, even when he was the one in the wrong. I always forgave him. Always found a way to excuse his behavior. Always hoped he’d change.



Once, I genuinely believed he loved me.



He used to do the little things—hold my hand when we crossed the street, text me good luck before every exam, show up with coffee when I’d pulled an all-nighter. There were moments that felt so perfect, like the surprise picnic he planned for my birthday or how he stayed up all night helping me cram for finals. Those were the memories I clung to when everything else started to fall apart.



But as time passed, things began to shift. He stopped listening when I spoke. When I cried, he called me dramatic. When I tried to explain why I was upset, he’d say, “You’re just too sensitive.” And somehow, I always ended up feeling guilty.



The love I thought we had became one-sided. He only cared when it was convenient—when he needed comfort, praise, or someone to stand beside him in public. When I needed support, he was always busy or indifferent.



I couldn’t pinpoint when it happened, but I stopped recognizing the version of myself that stayed with him.



Maybe it was fear. Maybe it was the hope that he’d go back to being the boy I fell for. Maybe I thought I didn’t deserve anything better.



But not anymore.



This time, I was leaving for good. No more explanations. No more apologies for loving too much. I was done.



Without glancing back, I walked out the door. A black luxury car was parked at the curb. My mother’s driver stood waiting and opened the door the moment he saw me. I got in wordlessly, my grip tightening around the handle of my suitcase as the car pulled away.



Every second, the distance between me and Caleb widened—not just physically, but emotionally too. And with each passing block, I felt a small part of myself begin to return.



When I arrived at the police station, two officers were already waiting for me. One of them offered a reassuring nod and led me to the interrogation room.



“We have him,” the officer said. “He confessed to being involved.”



My chest tightened. I stepped inside, my hands clammy as I faced the man who had haunted my nights.



He sat in a chair, chained at the wrist, wearing a smirk that faded the moment he saw me. I sat across from him, my heart pounding.



“Why did you do it?” I asked, my voice cold and controlled.



He leaned back and shrugged. “Wasn’t personal. I was paid.”



My breath caught. “Paid?” I echoed.



He nodded, nonchalant. “Yeah. Bianca Kingsley. She was the one who hired us. Said you needed to be taught a lesson. Said we should make sure you didn’t have anything left to hold onto—especially not the baby.”



I froze. The air left my lungs.



“Bianca?” I asked in disbelief, my voice barely audible.



He nodded again. “She wanted you gone. Claimed you were ruining her plans with your boyfriend. Told us to make you suffer, but not kill you—just break you enough that you wouldn’t come back.”



I sat there in stunned silence, every word he spoke driving a dagger deeper into my chest.



Bianca had been the one to orchestrate everything. Not just the manipulation, not just the betrayal—but the violence, the trauma. My body, my baby, my peace… all stolen because of her.



I stood up slowly, my fists clenched tightly.



“Make sure Caleb Grayson hears every word of this,” I said to the officers. “Send him the full report. I want him to see the truth he refused to believe.”



They nodded, assuring me they would deliver the information.



As I stepped outside into the night, the air hit my face like a wave of reality. The cold didn’t sting. I welcomed it.



Later that evening, I stood at the airport, watching the blinking lights of the departure board. My flight to Sydney was boarding soon. A strange calm settled over me.



Then my phone rang.



Caleb.



His name flashed on the screen, but I felt nothing—not anger, not sadness. Just finality.



I answered.



“Where are you?” he demanded, breathless and panicked. “Rhea, please. Let’s talk.”



I held the phone to my ear, my expression unmoving. “I’m going somewhere you’ll never find me,” I said quietly. “And this time, I won’t be coming back.”



Before he could reply, I ended the call and blocked his number.



The gate attendant called for boarding. I walked forward, heart steady, eyes clear.



I didn’t need closure. I didn’t need revenge. I just needed freedom.

1m0a4td,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m0a4td/aita_for_refusing_to_change_jobs_because_of_my/,AITA for refusing to change jobs because of my friend's girlfriend?,"I (23M) recently moved to Seoul and got a job as a stage performer at a local club. I'm in good shape, so my job involves putting on shows for female audiences - dancing, interacting with them on stage, going into the crowd, etc. It's physically demanding work, and sometimes I get inappropriately touched (like getting scratches on my torso, which sucks since my looks are part of my income). But the pay is good, and I really need the money.  

Here's why: My older brother recently battled a serious illness, lost his income, and my parents drained their savings to help him. Before this, they could support me financially - now it's my turn to help them.  

Enter my best friend ""Jay"" (25M), who's lived in Seoul for years with his girlfriend Annie (27F). Recently, Jay used his work bonus to buy front-row tickets to my show. Big mistake.  

During my performance (where I'm required to interact with front-row attendees), I approached their section. Annie wrapped her arms around me, ran her hands over my body, and basically clung to me for several seconds. Standard work stuff - I was about to move on when Jay started yelling at me to ""get away from his girl"" and shoved me slightly.  

Our club’s protocol when guys get jealous: We’re trained to immediately disengage and redirect. No arguing, just exit the situation. This isn’t my first rodeo with jealous boyfriends, so when Annie full-on groped me during my crowd walk (standard for my role), and Jay started shoving/yelling, I followed protocol and walked away. 

After the show, Jay sent then deleted some angry voice messages before sending a final text: He apologized for attacking me but said Annie is ""obsessed"" with me and demanded a face-to-face talk (his idea!). At coffee, he dropped a bomb.
1) Annie won't stop talking about me  
2) Her touching me was ""inappropriate""    
He insisted I quit my job. 

I said no:  
1. This income supports my family 
2. Audience interaction is mandatory —I can’t pick and choose  
3. He brought her to my workplace, knowing what my job entails  

Jay accused me of ""encouraging"" her, gave a ""quit or we’re done"" ultimatum, and **blocked me everywhere when I stood my ground.  
Now I'm sitting here like... WTF? AITA for prioritizing my family's financial needs over my friend's jealousy?

1m0a4eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1m0a4eg/forgotten_once_gone_forever/,"Forgotten Once, Gone Forever","Chapter 1

I imagined my graduation marking a bright new chapter—achievement, celebration, love. But instead of standing beside me, Caleb, the man I trusted most, spent the day in the arms of someone he once called ""just a friend.""

Shattered, I wandered into a bar, desperate for escape. I never expected that night to end in darkness—my drink tampered with, my body violated, my voice ignored. And with that horror, I lost a life I hadn’t yet told him about: our unborn child.

The hospital walls couldn’t contain the truth. A live stream revealed it all—Caleb’s betrayal, Bianca’s smug smile, their mockery of my pain. The life I thought I had with him? It was a lie.

He used to say I’d fall apart without him.

But this time, I’m walking away—not broken, but rebuilding. And I won’t be looking back.

\--

The hospital ceiling above me was blank—white, cold, unforgiving. I lay there, aching from the inside out, a thousand invisible cracks spider-webbed through every part of me. My physical wounds were painful, yes—but they were nothing compared to the weight pressing down on my chest, the kind that made it hard to even breathe.

For a while, I stared at the empty chair beside me, waiting—naively—for Caleb to walk through that door. I imagined his arms wrapping around me, his voice trembling as he asked if I was okay. But he never came. He wasn’t coming.

I tried to call him. The line rang, over and over, but he didn’t pick up. A piece of me still hoped he didn’t know what had happened, that maybe—just maybe—he’d come running once he did. But when I opened my secret Instagram account and saw the live video, any sliver of hope I had left turned to ash.

There he was. My boyfriend of over a year. Holding Bianca like she was his prize. She smiled with smug satisfaction, draped across him as if she’d won.

And maybe she had.

“Hey, Caleb,” someone behind the camera laughed. “What would your girl think if she saw this?”

“She’d believe whatever I told her,” he replied with a lazy smirk. “She always does.”

I felt the betrayal physically. My stomach twisted, and my vision blurred as the phone slipped from my hand.

Just last night, I was fighting for my life. I had gone to a bar alone—broken and humiliated because Caleb ditched my graduation celebration. I drank to forget, unaware someone had spiked my drink. By the time I realized, it was too late. The men dragged me away like I was nothing more than a forgotten possession.

My body had failed me. I had screamed in my mind, but no words would come. I managed to call Caleb, desperate for help.

""Help me,"" I had whispered.

He didn’t believe me. He didn’t even hesitate.

""Stop pretending,” he said. “You’re just upset I wasn’t there.”

Then came Bianca’s voice—seductive, cruel. “Should I take off the lingerie now?” she teased.

And that was it. The call ended. I was left alone, surrounded by monsters, deprived of power and dignity.

But the worst part wasn’t even the physical violation. It was what I lost that night—something no one knew about yet. I had been carrying a secret inside me, a new life. I was going to tell Caleb after graduation. I had imagined him smiling, holding me, whispering promises for our future. But that moment never came.

Instead, I lost the baby I had barely begun to love.

I lay in a cold, unfamiliar field afterward, blood-soaked and broken, and thought I might die. Maybe I wanted to.

But I didn’t. I woke up. I survived.

And as I stared at that empty chair in the hospital, I realized something: I couldn’t keep waiting for someone who had already chosen to leave.

So I picked up the phone again. This time, with purpose.

“Mom,” I said.

“Rhea? Sweetheart, are you okay?”

“I’m going to take the job in Sydney. Please help me get out of here.”

It was the beginning of the end—and the start of something new.

I wasn’t going to waste another minute on Caleb or the dream I used to cling to. I would rebuild myself, piece by piece, no matter how long it took.

Because he had abandoned me at my lowest.

But I?

I would rise.

Chapter 2

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, even as I curled tighter beneath the hospital blanket. Every time I closed my eyes, the memories stormed back like a flood I couldn’t contain—the cruel chuckles, the rough hands, the helplessness pressing down on me until I could barely breathe. I gripped the edge of the sheet, forcing air into my lungs, trying to steady myself. I kept whispering in my head, You’re okay. You’re safe now. But it didn’t feel true.

I was surviving, but I wasn’t really living. I was still alone in this fight.

At some point, exhaustion must have pulled me under. When I opened my eyes again, it wasn’t because of a nightmare—it was because someone was touching me.

Fear shot through my veins like ice. My muscles tensed, and before I could think, I shoved the hand away with every ounce of strength I had.

“Whoa! Rhea, it’s me—it’s just me,” a voice said quickly.

My vision adjusted to the low light, and I saw him standing there—Caleb. His expression was one of confusion and mild concern, as if I’d simply woken up from a bad dream.

“Babe, are you okay? You looked terrified.”

His voice. That voice I used to run to for comfort now made my skin crawl. After everything I had been through—after the night I begged him to help me, sobbing through the phone—and he dismissed me as if I were acting dramatic… How dare he show up now, pretending like nothing had happened?

“What are you doing here?” I asked, my voice cold and raw, laced with disbelief.

He gave me a casual smile and held up a plastic bag. “I just got back. Thought I’d surprise you. Got a few things for you—souvenirs and stuff.”

I turned my back on him without a word, bile rising in my throat. His presence alone felt like poison.

His tone changed, sharp and defensive. “What the heck is your problem? Are you seriously still mad I missed your graduation? You’re being ridiculous.”

I clenched the blanket so hard my knuckles turned white.

“This is about Bianca again, isn’t it?” he added with a huff, already rolling his eyes.

I said nothing, trying to hold myself together.

He winced and ran a hand through his hair. “Rhea, for God’s sake. She’s a client. A business contact. Why are you always so insecure?”

That was it.

I turned to him slowly, my voice trembling with fury. “You think this is about jealousy? About graduation?”

He opened his mouth, but I didn’t let him speak.

“They tied me up, Caleb. They beat me until I couldn’t scream anymore. They laughed while I cried and begged. And where were you?” My voice cracked. “I called you. I begged you.”

His expression flickered, maybe with guilt—maybe just annoyance. I couldn’t tell.

Before he could say anything, his phone buzzed.

He answered immediately. “Bianca?” he said, his voice softening, filled with concern.

Of course.

He listened for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, I’ll come now. Don’t worry. I’m on my way.”

He ended the call and turned to me with urgency.

“Bianca’s in the hospital,” he said. “She needs me.”

I stared at him, stunned. “And I don’t?” I whispered, barely audible.

“She’s not well,” he said flatly. “You’re strong. You’ll be fine.”

I laughed bitterly, though it came out as a broken sound. “I was attacked. I’m bleeding on the inside, Caleb.”

“She’s like a sister,” he said, exasperated. “Why do you always twist everything? You say you love me—so act like it. Understand that sometimes other people need me too.”

That was the moment something inside me snapped.

“No,” I said, stepping away from him. “Loving you means breaking myself into pieces to make you whole. I’m done.”

I didn’t wait for his reply. I grabbed my phone, my hands still trembling, and stormed out. My feet carried me to the nearest bathroom. I slammed the door shut and collapsed onto the floor, pressing a towel to my face to muffle the sobs that burst from my chest. Tears streamed down my face, hot and endless, soaking the towel as I cried like something inside me had died.

Because maybe it had.

There were no words left to say to Caleb. No strength left to argue, to explain, to beg him to care.

Then my phone buzzed again.

It was my mom.

“Rhea?” she said gently, “I’ve made all the arrangements. Everything’s set. You’re going to Sydney, just like we talked about.”

I wiped at my tears, trying to breathe. “I don’t know if I can go through with it…”

Her voice was soothing but firm. “You have to, honey. You need a fresh start. And you won’t be alone. Jasper will be waiting for you. He’s going to help you settle in.”

“Jasper?” I asked, frowning slightly. The name tugged at a distant part of my memory.

“Your childhood friend. You used to build sandcastles together every summer, remember? He offered to help when I told him what happened. He’s a good man, Rhea. And he’ll look out for you.”

I hesitated. Leaving meant closing a chapter I wasn’t ready to let go of. Not entirely.

“Honey,” she added softly, “the authorities are investigating. We’re going to catch the men who did this to you. You’re not alone in this anymore. They’ll face justice. I promise you.”

Her words cracked something inside me—not from pain this time, but from resolve. I wasn’t just leaving to run away. I was choosing to survive. And more than that—I was choosing to heal.

“Thanks, Mom,” I whispered. “Really.”

As I ended the call, my gaze drifted to the window. Beyond it was the city where I had lost so much—my innocence, my trust, my future with Caleb. But now, I had the chance to start over. A chance to rebuild.

And somewhere deep in my soul, anger began to harden into something stronger—determination.

Caleb hadn’t just ignored me. He had minimized my pain, invalidated my trauma, and walked away when I needed him most. He had made me feel like nothing.

But I wasn’t nothing.

I wasn’t powerless.

I stood up, wiped the last of my tears, and walked out with a newfound clarity. My suitcase waited quietly in the corner. I began packing—deliberately, forcefully. Clothes, documents, pieces of a past I was finally ready to leave behind.

I was leaving in three days.

And when I left, I wouldn’t look back.

Not at Caleb.

Not at the pain.

Not at the shattered girl who once waited for a man who would never choose her.

This time, I was choosing me.

Chapter 3

My fingers trembled slightly as I closed the final zipper on my luggage. The police had contacted me earlier in the morning—they had apprehended one of the men involved in my assault. The moment I heard the news, a knot formed in my stomach. The thought of facing it all over again—of confronting that night—made my skin crawl. But deep down, I knew I couldn’t run from it. Not anymore. I had to face the past, even if it meant reliving my worst nightmare. I couldn’t let fear define me any longer.

I was just about to walk out the front door when it flew open with a thud. Caleb stormed into the room, his expression stormy and volatile.

“Where are you going?” He barked, eyes narrowing on me.

I adjusted my bag on my shoulder, refusing to meet his gaze. I didn’t owe him an explanation—not after everything he’d done.

“Oh, I get it,” he sneered. “You’re off to meet your boyfriend, right? You’ve been sneaking around, haven’t you?”

His words made me stop in my tracks. I turned toward him, my brows furrowed. “What are you talking about, Caleb?”

With a twisted smirk, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a thick set of photographs. He tossed them dramatically onto the floor between us, the glossy images fanning out in every direction.

I looked down—and froze.

There I was, sprawled on a bed, unclothed and unconscious. The photos were taken from angles that made my stomach lurch with disgust and horror. My breath caught in my throat as the realization hit me: they were from that night. The night I had been drugged and violated.

“Where did you get these?” I demanded, my voice trembling as my eyes remained locked on the images.

Caleb’s voice turned cruel. “Does it really matter? The truth is right in front of me—you betrayed me.”

I took a step back, the sheer weight of his accusation making my chest tighten. “Betrayed you?” I asked. “I didn’t betray anyone! I was assaulted, Caleb! I was drugged, deprived of my dignity, and tortured—don’t you get it?”

He shook his head stubbornly, his eyes cold and unyielding. “Save the lies. Bianca told me everything.”

I gave a bitter, disbelieving laugh. “Of course she did. Because whatever Bianca says must be gospel to you.”

“She’s not a liar,” he snapped. “She was devastated when she found out. She only told me because she thought I had a right to know the truth.”

The air around me felt suffocating. I was exhausted—mentally, emotionally, physically—from constantly defending myself, from being weighed down by his blind loyalty to the one woman who had manipulated everything.

“You know what, Caleb?” I said quietly but firmly, locking eyes with him. “I’m done justifying myself to someone who refuses to hear me.”

I turned to leave, my fingers tightening around the handle of my bag. But before I could take another step, Caleb’s hand shot out and grabbed my arm, his grip bruising.

“You’re not walking away from me,” he growled.

“Let go of me!” I cried out, yanking my arm, but his hold only tightened.

The next thing I knew, pain exploded across my cheek. His hand had struck me—hard. I stumbled backward, stunned. My face throbbed, my vision swimming with disbelief. He had hit me.

For a moment, the room was dead silent.

Then I slowly raised my head, my entire body trembling—not from fear this time, but from rage.

“I can’t believe you just did that,” I whispered, voice raw.

He stood there, chest heaving, eyes wild.

“This is it, Caleb,” I said, my voice rising with fury. “You want to believe Bianca? Fine. You want to think I’m the villain? Be my guest. But I’m done being your punching bag—literally and figuratively.”

Without thinking, I lifted my hand and slapped him across the face. The sharp crack echoed through the house.

“I’m leaving,” I declared, fire burning in my chest. “And there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”

As if summoned by our chaos, the door creaked open again. Bianca stepped in, looking every bit the part of a concerned, delicate flower.

“What’s happening?” she asked, voice laced with false innocence. “Is this about me?”

I glared at her, my patience obliterated.

“I didn’t mean to cause any trouble,” she continued softly, her voice trembling like she was about to cry. “I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. When I saw those pictures… I was broken. You’re like a brother to me, Caleb. I just wanted to protect you.”

I could barely contain the fury rising in me. My fists clenched at my sides, my nails digging into my palms.

“You liar,” I spat, stepping toward her. “You’ve been the one tearing us apart. You’ve been the one crawling into his bed behind my back.”

Her eyes widened, a flicker of real fear flashing through her carefully constructed facade.

“Don’t act like the victim now, Bianca,” I continued, my voice shaking with emotion. “You manipulated him. You fed him lies while playing the perfect little innocent. But I see through you now. And I’m done pretending.”

Chapter 4

Bianca burst into loud, dramatic sobs the moment my hand connected with her cheek. She clutched her face like I had committed some horrific crime, her cries echoing through the room.

Caleb immediately pushed past me and stepped protectively in front of her, glaring at me with fire in his eyes. Without warning, he shoved me backward, hard enough to make me stumble.

“What on earth is wrong with you?” he shouted. “She just got discharged from the hospital, and you think hitting her is okay?”

I steadied myself, rage burning in my veins as I stood tall again. “Of course,” I said bitterly, staring him down. “Of course you’re defending her—like always. That’s all you’ve ever done. You know what, Caleb? I’m done playing this game. If she’s what you want, go be with her. I’m finished with you. We're done.”

“No,” he said instantly, his voice shaking with disbelief. “You don’t get to leave me. You’re not walking away from this.”

I let out a laugh—sharp and humorless. “No, Caleb. You’re the one who can’t survive without me. And soon, you’ll understand exactly what that means.”

I turned toward the door, lifting my bag onto my shoulder, ready to leave it all behind.

But before I could step out, I heard his voice behind me—calm, casual, like this was just another day. “Relax, Bianca. She’ll come crawling back like she always does. She’s just throwing another tantrum.”

That cut deeper than anything he’d ever done.

For a second, I stood there in silence, the weight of his words pressing down on me like stones. I remembered all the times I’d gotten angry at him—hurt by his indifference, his gaslighting—only to end up apologizing, even when he was the one in the wrong. I always forgave him. Always found a way to excuse his behavior. Always hoped he’d change.

Once, I genuinely believed he loved me.

He used to do the little things—hold my hand when we crossed the street, text me good luck before every exam, show up with coffee when I’d pulled an all-nighter. There were moments that felt so perfect, like the surprise picnic he planned for my birthday or how he stayed up all night helping me cram for finals. Those were the memories I clung to when everything else started to fall apart.

But as time passed, things began to shift. He stopped listening when I spoke. When I cried, he called me dramatic. When I tried to explain why I was upset, he’d say, “You’re just too sensitive.” And somehow, I always ended up feeling guilty.

The love I thought we had became one-sided. He only cared when it was convenient—when he needed comfort, praise, or someone to stand beside him in public. When I needed support, he was always busy or indifferent.

I couldn’t pinpoint when it happened, but I stopped recognizing the version of myself that stayed with him.

Maybe it was fear. Maybe it was the hope that he’d go back to being the boy I fell for. Maybe I thought I didn’t deserve anything better.

But not anymore.

This time, I was leaving for good. No more explanations. No more apologies for loving too much. I was done.

Without glancing back, I walked out the door. A black luxury car was parked at the curb. My mother’s driver stood waiting and opened the door the moment he saw me. I got in wordlessly, my grip tightening around the handle of my suitcase as the car pulled away.

Every second, the distance between me and Caleb widened—not just physically, but emotionally too. And with each passing block, I felt a small part of myself begin to return.

When I arrived at the police station, two officers were already waiting for me. One of them offered a reassuring nod and led me to the interrogation room.

“We have him,” the officer said. “He confessed to being involved.”

My chest tightened. I stepped inside, my hands clammy as I faced the man who had haunted my nights.

He sat in a chair, chained at the wrist, wearing a smirk that faded the moment he saw me. I sat across from him, my heart pounding.

“Why did you do it?” I asked, my voice cold and controlled.

He leaned back and shrugged. “Wasn’t personal. I was paid.”

My breath caught. “Paid?” I echoed.

He nodded, nonchalant. “Yeah. Bianca Kingsley. She was the one who hired us. Said you needed to be taught a lesson. Said we should make sure you didn’t have anything left to hold onto—especially not the baby.”

I froze. The air left my lungs.

“Bianca?” I asked in disbelief, my voice barely audible.

He nodded again. “She wanted you gone. Claimed you were ruining her plans with your boyfriend. Told us to make you suffer, but not kill you—just break you enough that you wouldn’t come back.”

I sat there in stunned silence, every word he spoke driving a dagger deeper into my chest.

Bianca had been the one to orchestrate everything. Not just the manipulation, not just the betrayal—but the violence, the trauma. My body, my baby, my peace… all stolen because of her.

I stood up slowly, my fists clenched tightly.

“Make sure Caleb Grayson hears every word of this,” I said to the officers. “Send him the full report. I want him to see the truth he refused to believe.”

They nodded, assuring me they would deliver the information.

As I stepped outside into the night, the air hit my face like a wave of reality. The cold didn’t sting. I welcomed it.

Later that evening, I stood at the airport, watching the blinking lights of the departure board. My flight to Sydney was boarding soon. A strange calm settled over me.

Then my phone rang.

Caleb.

His name flashed on the screen, but I felt nothing—not anger, not sadness. Just finality.

I answered.

“Where are you?” he demanded, breathless and panicked. “Rhea, please. Let’s talk.”

I held the phone to my ear, my expression unmoving. “I’m going somewhere you’ll never find me,” I said quietly. “And this time, I won’t be coming back.”

Before he could reply, I ended the call and blocked his number.

The gate attendant called for boarding. I walked forward, heart steady, eyes clear.

I didn’t need closure. I didn’t need revenge. I just needed freedom.

We were loving it until our upstairs neighbor moved in. The sound transfers terribly, which is not his fault. Honestly I don’t think he is stomping just walking normally (there is no carpet only vinyl flooring). The hours he is doing it are just…terrible. You think you have respite but he’s back to doing it early in the AM. It frequently wakes us in the night. This may be all fine and dandy except…we have a 2.5 month old. We are already operating on a small amount of sleep so the footsteps really feel like a kick in the face. Our apartment broker assured us our building had condo grade concrete barriers between each floor which is the only reason we signed for a first floor. 

On a day I had received very little sleep (felt dizzy from lack of sleep) and our upstairs neighbor decided to play music so loudly it shook the coffee in our coffee pot. This enraged me so I walked my ass up to his apartment with my baby and politely but angrily asked him essentially “what the fuck”. Because this was our first interaction I have NO idea how to go about anything. 

My baby is not an excessive crier and we take her outside when she gets going to be respectful. This happens maybe once a day around 7PM witching hour. 

Because I have a baby do we call it even?? Am I wrong in thinking that 12AM-3AM is sort of an insane time to be consistently moving around your apartment on a daily basis compounded by him getting his day started soon after it ends?? It can make night feedings and crib transfers even more delicate as the footsteps startle her and awake her.

[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertrubinstein/)Where Radical Truth Meets Capital Mobilisation Unlocking Purpose-Driven Capital (Minus the Greenwash)July 15, 2025

Let me tell you something that's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable at their next country club meeting or Sand Hill Road coffee chat. The venture capital industry has a massive, glaring, embarrassing problem, and it's time someone said it without the usual corporate-speak bullshit.

**Women get jack shit for funding.**

Not ""less funding"" or ""challenging funding environments"" or whatever sanitized language we use to make everyone feel better. They get practically nothing. In 2023, female-founded companies received a whopping 2.1% of all venture capital funding. Two point one percent. That's not a typo—that's a travesty.

# Global VC Funding by Gender (2024-2025)(https://ff.co/women-funding-statistics-2025/) 

Analysis of global venture capital deployment shows that of the $289 billion invested globally in 2024:\[2\]



* **2.3%** went to female-only founding teams ($6.7 billion)
* **83.6%** went to all-male founding teams ($241.9 billion)
* **14.1%** went to mixed-gender founding teams ($40.7 billion)



But here's where it gets really interesting: when you look at female-led VC firms, the numbers are even more pathetic. These firms manage less than 3% of total assets under management in the industry. So not only are women not getting funded, but the women who do make it to the other side of the table are getting starved of resources too.

# The Math Doesn't Lie (But Apparently VCs Do)

Let's do some basic arithmetic that apparently escaped the Harvard MBAs running these firms:



* Women make up roughly 50% of the population
* Women start businesses at nearly the same rate as men
* Women-led companies generate 35% higher returns on investment
* Women-led companies achieve 12% higher revenue growth



So if you're a rational investor focused on returns, you'd be throwing money at female founders faster than a kid chasing an ice cream truck. But that's not happening. Why? Because this industry isn't actually about merit or returns—it's about comfort zones and pattern matching.

# The Real Truth About ""Pattern Matching""

VCs love to talk about ""pattern matching""—looking for founders who fit successful profiles. But let's be honest about what that really means: they're looking for people who look like them, talk like them, and went to the same schools as them.

It's the ultimate lazy investor strategy. Instead of actually doing the work to evaluate business fundamentals, market opportunity, and execution capability, they just ask themselves: ""Does this person remind me of Mark Zuckerberg?""

Here's the problem: Mark Zuckerberg was a statistical anomaly, not a pattern. Betting your entire investment thesis on recreating lightning in a bottle is about as smart as buying lottery tickets for your retirement fund.

# The Excuses Are Getting Old

I've heard every excuse in the book:

""Women don't ask for enough money."" Really? Maybe because they've been conditioned by years of being told they're ""too aggressive"" when they negotiate?

""The pipeline isn't there."" Bullshit. The pipeline is there—you're just not looking hard enough because you're too busy taking meetings with the same recycled entrepreneurs from your Stanford alumni network.

""Women are more risk-averse."" This one's my favorite. The same industry that funded Theranos, WeWork, and countless other disasters is worried about women being too conservative with capital allocation?

# The Systemic Problem

This isn't just about individual bias—though there's plenty of that. It's about systemic structures that perpetuate inequality:

Investment committees that look like a 1950s board meeting. Due diligence processes that favor aggressive self-promotion over substance. Networks that operate like exclusive fraternities where access depends on who you know, not what you know.

The result? A massive market inefficiency where superior entrepreneurs are systematically excluded from capital allocation decisions.

# The Cost of Stupidity

While VCs are busy funding the 47th food delivery app created by a 23-year-old Stanford dropout, they're missing massive opportunities. Companies founded by women are more likely to:



* Solve real problems instead of manufactured ones
* Build sustainable businesses instead of hype machines
* Generate actual profits instead of just burning cash
* Create inclusive workplaces that attract top talent



But hey, why invest in proven performance when you can throw money at another ""Uber for X"" company? Or better yet, let's talk about Climeworks—the darling of climate tech that's raised over $1 billion to build machines that literally produce more CO2 than they capture. Yes, you read that right. The construction, transportation, and operation of their facilities generate more carbon dioxide than their fancy machines can suck out of the air. It's like funding a company that loses money on every sale but makes up for it in volume.

Meanwhile, female entrepreneurs with actual solutions to climate change, healthcare, and education can't get a meeting. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a venture term sheet.

# What Needs to Change

The solution isn't more unconscious bias training or diversity workshops. Those are feel-good measures that change nothing. What we need is:

**Mandate transparency.** Publish funding data by gender, race, and background. Let LPs see exactly where their money is going.

**Change the incentive structure.** Tie GP compensation to diversity metrics, not just financial returns.

**Expand the decision-making pool.** Stop letting the same five guys make all the investment decisions.

**Question the fundamentals.** Maybe the problem isn't that women don't fit the pattern—maybe the pattern is wrong.

# The Bottom Line

The venture capital industry likes to think of itself as a meritocracy that funds the best ideas and most capable entrepreneurs. The data says otherwise. It's a closed system that systematically excludes half the population from meaningful capital allocation.

This isn't about being politically correct or checking boxes. It's about basic competence. Any industry that ignores 50% of the talent pool while generating inferior returns is fundamentally broken.

The question isn't whether this will change—demographic trends and LP pressure will force change eventually. The question is whether current VCs will adapt or get left behind by firms that actually know how to identify and fund talent wherever it comes from.

The uncomfortable truth is that the emperor has no clothes, and everyone can see it. The only question is who's going to be brave enough to say it out loud.

*What do you think? Are you ready to have an honest conversation about capital allocation, or are we going to keep pretending that 2.1% represents a functioning market?*

Where Radical Truth Meets Capital Mobilisation Unlocking Purpose-Driven Capital (Minus the Greenwash)July 15, 2025

Let me tell you something that's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable at their next country club meeting or Sand Hill Road coffee chat. The venture capital industry has a massive, glaring, embarrassing problem, and it's time someone said it without the usual corporate-speak bullshit.

**Women get jack shit for funding.**

Not ""less funding"" or ""challenging funding environments"" or whatever sanitized language we use to make everyone feel better. They get practically nothing. In 2023, female-founded companies received a whopping 2.1% of all venture capital funding. Two point one percent. That's not a typo—that's a travesty.

# Global VC Funding by Gender (2024-2025)(https://ff.co/women-funding-statistics-2025/) 

Analysis of global venture capital deployment shows that of the $289 billion invested globally in 2024:\[2\]



* **2.3%** went to female-only founding teams ($6.7 billion)
* **83.6%** went to all-male founding teams ($241.9 billion)
* **14.1%** went to mixed-gender founding teams ($40.7 billion)



But here's where it gets really interesting: when you look at female-led VC firms, the numbers are even more pathetic. These firms manage less than 3% of total assets under management in the industry. So not only are women not getting funded, but the women who do make it to the other side of the table are getting starved of resources too.

1m0a16x,https://i.redd.it/d27ynhgpazcf1.jpeg,Title??,"Chapter 1 Fresh Out
Embridge City was getting clobbered by a rare snowstorm, the kind that hits once every five years. Downtown's busy streets were empty, the wind howling and snow biting like icy needles.

Snow piled up past ankles, nearly to knees, and in the dead of winter, a girl trudged through it in a flimsy summer dress. Her skinny frame pushed against the gusts, moving slow but steady.

Meanwhile, the Prosperity Hotel was throwing a fancy birthday party for Averie Webb, the darling daughter of Roberton Properties' big-shot CEO.

Inside, it was all clinking glasses and stunning gowns, worlds away from the blizzard outside. The posh, heated lobby buzzed with glitz and chatter.

Clink, clink!

Someone tapped a wine glass, and all eyes turned.

Robert Webb stood in the spotlight, raising his glass with a grin. ""Hey, thanks for coming out to celebrate my girl Averie's big day. Averie, come say hi to everyone!""

""Go on, sweetie,"" Gloria Webb said, giving her daughter a gentle nudge and a proud smile.

A young woman in a sleek LV strapless gown—straight off the spring runway—strolled up to Robert's side. ""Dad,"" she said with a playful smirk, then flashed a big wave. ""Hey, y'all!""

Robert, beaming like a proud papa, grabbed her hand. ""People love to rag on my business wins, but let's be real: my real win's right here—Averie.""

He shot her a soft look. ""I thank my lucky stars for you every day, kid. Just want you happy.""

""Dad, I love you."" Averie's eyes teared up as she hugged his arm.

The room exploded in applause.

Whispers floated through the crowd.

""Miss Webb's a total gem—gorgeous, Embridge University grad, and a hotshot writer. If she were my kid, I'd be bragging louder than Robert!""

""Forget her resume—she's the daughter Robert moved mountains to find. No wonder he treats her like she's made of gold.""

""That drama five years back was insane. Robert hit the jackpot tracking her down.""

""What about the other girl?""

""Oh, you didn't hear? When she found out her real folks were dirt poor, she clung to the Webbs like a leech. Robert and Gloria were sweet enough to keep her on as an adopted kid—money's no problem for them, you know?

""But she kept acting like she was the real deal, always trying to outshine Averie, even bullying her. Then her actual parents showed up, and—get this—she was so desperate to stay she ran over her own dad with a car to dodge going back!""

""No way! Someone's that twisted?""

Just then, a cheer erupted from the front, yanking the gossipers' attention back to the party's electric vibe.

A jaw-dropping birthday cake was wheeled to the stage's center, candles glowing, colors popping like crazy.

Mateo Porter, looking slick in a navy suit, held a bunch of lilies and strode toward Averie, who was stealing the show.

""Happy birthday, Averie,"" he said with a grin, handing her the flowers.

Averie's cheeks turned pink as she grabbed the lilies, smiling.

Mateo took a half-step back, dropped to one knee, and flipped open a blue velvet box. His eyes locked on hers. ""Marry me, Averie.""

Averie froze. A proposal at her birthday bash? She was stunned, too thrilled to speak.

The room went nuts.

""That's the Hickum Construction heir, right?"" someone whispered.

""Roberton Properties and Hickum Construction? Perfect match! I'm so jealous!"" another said.

The younger girls squealed, ""Ugh, Mateo's insanely hot! I can't!""

Even Robert, onstage, looked shocked. Gloria tugged his sleeve, buzzing. A tie with Hickum Construction would be huge for Roberton Properties.

Robert snapped out of it and grinned at Averie. ""Hey, don't just stand there! Say yes!""

Mateo, still on one knee, flashed a warm smile.

Averie's heart raced as she reached for him. But then, the hall's doors burst open, a cold draft hitting hard. Everyone shivered.

'Who shows up this late?' people thought.

Heads turned.

A girl stood at the door—short hair, scary thin, in a thin summer dress despite the freezing cold. Her skin was purple, shaking hard. But her eyes? Cold as ice, fixed on the Webb family onstage.

Some whispered about a beggar, but someone piped up, ""Wait, that's a Versace dress. Old, though. I couldn't even get one back then.""

""Check her bag,"" another scoffed. ""Chanel, but discontinued. And what's she stuffed in there? It's bulging. So tacky!""

""Who's this girl?""

Onstage, Averie glanced at the door. Her face went pale when she saw who it was, and she scooted closer to Gloria like a scared kid.

The Webbs recognized her too.

Robert growled, ""Who let her in?""

The girl at the door smirked. ""What, I need a fancy invite now?"" She strolled forward, wet shoes smudging the pricey wool carpet with snow.

With a sharp grin, she said, ""This place? Used to be 'Serenity Hotel,' not 'Prosperity Hotel.' Built to my taste. I know every room, every exit, every camera blind spot. Still got it all locked in, Dad.""

Boom—the room erupted in gasps.

""Is that Solana? The Solana from way back?"" one muttered.

She snorted to herself. 'Yeah, Solana. But not that wide-eyed girl anymore.'

""She's got some nerve showing up. Thinks she's still a Webb or what?""

""Total shameless move.""

Solana had heard ""shameless"" a million times five years ago. Back then, she'd fought to defend herself. Now? Those words didn't even sting.

Someone gasped, ""Didn't she go to prison?""

Yup. She did.

She'd walked out of jail that morning, hopped a ten-hour bus, and landed back in Embridge City. A city that hit her like a cold slap, full of old grudges.

Robert saw her coming and barked, ""I'm not your dad! This is Averie's party—get out or I'm calling security!""

""Security? Pfft."" Solana shot him a fearless grin. ""Relax, I've got nothing left. What're you scared of? That I'll spill all your dirty secrets from back then?""

Chapter 2 She's Here To Settle Scores
Robert's face went white.

""Who the hell do you think you are?"" Mateo jumped up, ready to throw punches, but Averie gently stopped him.

""Mateo, relax,"" Averie said, taking a deep breath. She glided toward Solana, voice sweet as pie. ""Solana, we didn't know you got out today. Why no call?

""It's freezing, and you're dressed like that. You'll get sick. Let's go upstairs and grab you some warm clothes.""

She reached for Solana's arm. Solana slapped it away.

""Ouch!"" Averie, wobbling on sky-high heels, twisted her ankle. Her perfect face twisted in pain.

""Averie!""Gloria and Mateo rushed to help her.

Guests started whispering, throwing shade at Solana for being ungrateful.

Solana wiped snow off her face and shot Averie a nasty grin. ""That fake act? It fooled me once.""

""Solana, you—"" Gloria started, but Solana's glare cut her off.

She shot back,""Shut up! You fed me that crap about Averie being a small-town girl who needed help adjusting.

""You told me to stick with her since we're the same age. Then rumors spread I was a gold-digger mooching off your family. Not one of you defended me. My side? Worthless.

""You locked me in a room. Kept me from going home. And why? Don't act like you forgot. Got the guts to say it here? You swore you'd treat me like your kid, even though I wasn't blood. I believed you. Look how that turned out.""

Gloria's eyes darted away.

""Solana Webb! Stop lying!"" Robert roared, raising his hand to hit her.

Solana grabbed his wrist, shoving him back. ""You've got no right to touch me! And I'm Solana Spencer! You're not my dad!""

Robert's face burned red. ""I raised you for eighteen years! You're an ungrateful brat!""

""Ungrateful? That's a laugh!"" Solana's voice cracked, tears falling. She snatched Averie's wrist, pulling her in close. ""If I wasn't grateful, who took the rap for your perfect little Averie and went to prison?""

She glared at Averie. ""You called me in a panic after you hit someone, didn't you?"" She turned to Robert and Gloria. ""And you two begged me to cover for Averie because of those 'eighteen years.' You're not parents. You're a disgrace.""

Averie's face went white as a sheet, like she'd been caught red-handed. ""Solana, I know you're mad,"" she said, playing the victim card. ""But a crime's a crime. You can't just make shit up! And how can you talk about Mom and Dad like that? Who bought you all those fancy clothes, huh?""

The crowd started whispering again. Solana's story was so real, some folks were starting to believe her.

Robert pulled himself together, steadying his shaky wife with a sneer. ""That accident? Cops handled it, case closed. You trying to say the police screwed up? This is a lawful world, Solana. Nobody's buying your bullshit story.""

Averie jumped in, all fake pity. ""Dad, ease up. Solana's been through hell. Just got out of lockup—she's probably messed up. Let's go home and sort this out, okay? Solana,"" she said, turning to her, ""your folks are gone. Stay with us. We'll be like sisters.""

Solana couldn't stomach the act. She hauled off and slapped Averie hard across the face. Five red claw marks bloomed on her cheek, blood beading up.

""Solana, why'd you hit me?"" Averie shrieked, clutching her face, tears pouring. ""Oh my God, am I scarred? Mateo!""

Mateo moved to check on her, but Solana was faster. She kicked Averie's butt, dropping her to the floor with a yelp.

Grabbing a fistful of Averie's hair, Solana's eyes blazed. ""I took the blame for you, but you never told me you killed the man who raised you for eighteen years… my dad! He came for you, and you ran him down to avoid going back! You're the one who should be dead, Averie!""

""Solana, you're crazy!"" Mateo yelled, trying to pull her off.

Gloria screamed, rushing to protect her daughter.

But Solana was unstoppable. She yanked Averie's hair, watching her sob. Tears streamed down Solana's face. ""You should've been begging for forgiveness years ago! Apologize to my dad!"" She shoved Averie's head toward the floor.

Averie wailed, terrified.

""You're out of line!"" Robert stormed over and clocked Solana in the face.

She hadn't eaten all day, and between the hunger, exhaustion, and the hit, her head was spinning. Her grip on Averie slipped as someone pried her hands away.

Robert's voice rang in her ears. ""I thought prison would fix you, but you're still garbage! Five years wasn't enough—they should've locked you up forever!""

""Forever?"" Solana's rage flared. Clutching her throbbing head, she laughed bitterly. ""Five years, and no matter how good I was, every parole request got denied. Every single one!

""I know you pulled strings to keep me in. When my mom was dying, I begged you for help. Averie, you answered that call, didn't you? And you said, 'That's your mom, Solana. She's got nothing to do with me.'""

She stepped toward them, eyes burning with fury.

Averie was a trembling mess in Mateo's arms, shaking her head frantically. "" That's a lie! I never got your call. I stayed with your mom until the end. You can't just sling accusations! Mateo, please, you gotta have my back!""

Mateo's chest tightened as he pulled her close, the bruise on her cheek gutting him. ""I got you, babe. I know Solana's pulling this crap."" He shot Solana a scathing look, voice dripping with contempt. ""Solana, give it a rest. You think this stunt's gonna make me like you?

""Yeah, my mom wanted me to marry a Webb girl—meaning you, back then. But are you even a Webb? You fooled my mom, but you think I'm that dumb? That I'd fall for someone as toxic as you?""

Solana didn't even spare Mateo a glance. He wasn't worth her time. She was here for the Webbs, not this loser.

Security guards finally barreled in.

Security guards finally barreled in.

The guards rushed her, but Solana whipped something out of her chunky, old-school Chanel bag.

She spun, her icy stare freezing them in place. They'd never seen a girl her age with such a deadly edge.

Her eyes swept the room, voice cold as steel. ""Look close, idiots. This is a bomb. Want to live? Get the hell out—now.""

Chapter 3 No Rush At All
""It's a real bomb!"" someone in the crowd squeaked.

The guests, just seconds ago dishing gossip and playing morality police, freaked and bolted for the exits. Even the security goons sent to grab Solana ran like hell.

In a flash, only the Webbs—Robert, Gloria, Averie—and Mateo remained.

Solana stalked forward, each step dripping with intent, her words sharp as razors. ""You killed my dad. Kept me from Mom's last moments. You ruined us. Scum like you don't deserve to live.""

Robert's nerve started to crack. ""What the hell? Drop that thing, Solana!""

Gloria was a wreck, crumpled on the floor, shaking like crazy.

""Drop it? You think I'm scared?"" Solana shot back, eyes flicking to Mateo with a smirk. ""Didn't know you were so ride-or-die for her.""

Mateo was sweating bullets, itching to bolt.

Averie grabbed his arm, voice shaky. ""Mateo, she's bluffing! A bomb? Her? She just got outta jail—where's she buying that?""

Robert jumped in, nodding fast. ""Yeah, Solana, quit the act! Scram before you regret it!""

Gloria exhaled, thinking they'd called her out.

Solana's lips twisted into a icy grin. ""Buy it? Don't need to. High school chem's enough. Oh, wait—Averie, a dropout like you wouldn't know.""

Her words hit hard. Mateo's face went pale, and he shoved Averie off, sprinting for the door.

Averie stared at her so-called soulmate's back, yelling, ""Mateo! Get back here, you coward!""

Mateo didn't even glance back, running like his life depended on it.

Averie tried to chase, but Solana snagged her arm and shoved her back. With Averie's twisted ankle, it was easy.

Solana sneered. ""What happened to your 'true love'? That's how he's got your back?""

Averie's face was gray, stunned that Mateo bailed when it mattered.

Solana locked eyes with Robert. ""Oh, and that 'cheap watch' you let me keep when you framed me? Sold it. Bought the stuff for this. Your family paid for your own end.""

""You're nuts!"" Robert roared, lunging for the bomb.

Solana pushed Averie into him, knocking them both back. In one slick move, she swiped the bomb across Averie's birthday cake, candles sparking the fuse.

Averie dropped her tough act, shrieking, ""Are you insane? You'll die too!""

Solana's lips curved into a stunning, deadly smile. She tossed the bomb at the Webbs with a flick of her wrist.

She'd lost it all. Death? Didn't faze her.

But if she was going down, she'd make sure her parents got their justice. This rotten family wasn't walking away scot-free.

Seconds later, a massive blast shook Embridge City to its core.

'Mom, Dad, I'm making this right…' she thought bitterly.

*****

HONK HONK HONK!

A blaring horn jolted Solana as the car screeched to a halt, her body lurching forward. Her forehead slammed into the seatback, pain snapping her awake.

""You good, Miss Webb?"" Lucas Dunn, the driver, shot her an apologetic glance. ""Sorry, some jerk cut me off.""

""I'm fine,"" Solana muttered, rubbing her aching forehead. She sank into the soft leather seat, eyes flicking to the dashboard: July 25, 2020. Sophomore summer.

Yup. After she'd blown the Webb family—mom, dad, kid, and their swanky Prosperity Hotel—sky-high, she'd landed back here, five years earlier.

Before it all went south.

She'd woken up in Ofada City, 180 miles from Embridge City, smack in the middle of Mateo's over-the-top twentieth birthday party.

She'd rather be anywhere else, but the Roberts were obsessed with hooking her up with Mateo. Gloria even splurged on a fancy gown to drag her here.

Mateo's party was a spectacle. Embridge City was big, but Ofada? It was Vixaland's glittering heart, a global hotspot that made Embridge look small-time.

Mateo, always flexing, dropped a million to book the Perce Hotel, Ofada's ritziest seven-star hotel, just for a dinner with his buddies.

Solana hated the glitzy vibe and fake chatter. She'd parked herself on a corner sofa, sipping a drink, scrolling news on her phone, and dozed off.

A shrill ringtone snapped her awake.

The chaos around her felt like a dream—until Mateo, wasted as hell, stumbled over, kicking over wine bottles. Last time, he'd tried to flag her about the call before puking all over her.

Not today. Solana vaulted off the sofa like a pro, dodging just as Mateo barfed all over where she'd been.

""Whoa, Mateo, you okay, man?""A pack of brown-nosers, desperate to impress the Hickum Construction heir, rushed to clean up.

Solana stood frozen, heart pounding. This wasn't a dream. She was back.

Her phone buzzed like crazy, the same old ringtone looping.

It had to be Hana Hawkins, the Webb family's maid.

Solana answered fast, and Hana's panicked voice hit her. ""Miss Webb, we're in deep trouble…""

*****

Car horns blared outside as Solana stared at the hectic, familiar streets, a sly smirk creeping across her face.

Hana's voice came through the phone, all panicked. ""Mrs. Webb wiped out on the stairs yesterday—split her head open, blood everywhere. You gotta haul yourself back from Ofada City, stat!""

Everything was playing out just like she remembered. Not a thing different.

Solana could still feel the dread from that call years back, her heart pounding like a drum. The elevator at the Perce Hotel was moving at a snail's pace, so she'd kicked open the emergency exit and raced down 28 floors, screwing up her ankle so bad it was swollen for weeks.

And what was her reward? Robert, slamming her with a paternity test that proved she wasn't a Webb.

Lucas glanced at her from the driver's seat, catching her peek at her watch. ""Hey, Miss Webb, don't stress. Mrs. Webb's gonna be fine,"" he said.

Solana stifled a laugh. 'Do I look stressed? Nah. I'm dying to face the scumbags who trashed my family.'

In her old life, she had no clue this was the moment her whole world started to crumble.

Chapter 4 She's Playing With Fire
When Gloria got carted off to the hospital to stop the bleeding from her accident, she spotted Averie—a girl who looked like her spitting image.

Robert had heard enough gossip about how he and his daughter didn't look alike, and it got him suspicious.

Solana didn't hear about Gloria's injury until a full day later.

In that one day, Robert called in every favor he had. He dug into Averie's past and tracked down every woman who gave birth at Embridge City Hospital the same day as Gloria, eighteen years ago. And wouldn't one know it—Averie was born that day too.

In her old life, while Solana was freaking out over Gloria's condition, Robert and Gloria were secretly running a paternity test on her and Averie.

Once they had it all figured out, they dropped the truth on Solana like a wrecking ball.

Back then, she was just an eighteen-year-old, completely clueless.

She was scared senseless, totally alone, but did anyone care? Nope, not one bit.

Just thinking about it now sent a wave of fury crashing through Solana.

*****

The car pulled up to the Webb family's ritzy villa on the west side of town.

""We're here, Miss Webb,""Lucas said, glancing back.

Solana hopped out, eyeing the glowing villa—familiar but cold.

She didn't hesitate and marched right in.

Hana came bustling out. ""Miss Webb, you're back! Bet you're wiped out. Your mom's upstairs with your dad. She's doing okay, so don't freak out. Here, let me grab your bag.""

No one'd guess this sweet-talking Hana would turn nasty once the truth came out—that Solana wasn't a real Webb. When Averie moved in, Hana was all about helping her mess with Solana, sneaky or straight-up mean.

After Solana got locked up, Hana served her day-old porridge and ""accidentally"" soaked her blankets.

Yet here was that same fake Hana, grinning ear to ear, reaching for Solana's bag.

Solana clutched her backpack tight, blew right past her, and didn't say a word.

Hana stood there, caught off guard. 'What is with the usually polite girl?'

Figuring it was just worry about her mom, Hana let it slide and hurried after her. ""I'm serious, Mrs. Webb's okay. No lie.""

Solana didn't bother responding and headed straight upstairs.

Voices drifted from the master bedroom, but the second Solana pushed the door open, Robert and Gloria clammed up.

Gloria, head wrapped in gauze, looked pale but managed a weak smile. ""Solana, you're back? No need to rush home, hon. I'm fine.""

Robert shot Solana an icy glare and walked out.

Solana knew Gloria's smile was just for show—the paternity test results weren't in yet.

Solana finally figured out why Robert was always so cold. She used to think he was just a jerk who wanted a son. Wrong. He suspected Gloria had cheated with her old flame.

Gloria shut that down hard, threatening to end it all if he got a paternity test, claiming it'd mean he didn't trust her. So, he never did.

That doubt? It left Solana with zero fatherly love from Robert in her eighteen years with the Webb family.

Still, in her previous life, she was so naive. She bent over backward thanking the Webbs for ""raising"" her. Even when Robert acted like she was invisible, she clung to him as the most important man in her life—her dad.

Now, she couldn't wait to bolt. But Averie wasn't here yet, and Solana still needed the full story on her real parents. So, she had to suck it up a little longer.

""Solana, you okay? Scared stiff, huh?"" Gloria flashed a fake smile, reaching out. ""C'mere, kid, come to Mom.""

Solana trudged forward, letting Gloria grab her hand, her face blank as ever.

Gloria's eyes stayed glued to her, staring like she was sizing up a stranger.

Back then, Solana thought Gloria just missed her after a day apart. Now she knew better—Gloria was probably thinking, 'This girl doesn't even look like me.'

Good thing she wouldn't have to fake it much longer. Tomorrow, Averie—posing as the daughter of Robert's business buddy—would stroll into the Webb mansion.

""You good? I'm heading out,"" Solana said, voice ice-cold. In her old life, she'd have stayed up all night playing the good daughter. Now? She pulled her hand free and walked out without a glance.

*****

That night, Solana sprawled on her big, plush bed, too hyped to sleep. Tomorrow, she'd meet Averie. Her heart did a little flip just thinking about it.

Her phone buzzed.

She didn't bother checking. Probably Mateo, texting because his mom made him ""check on"" her family drama. He'd act like it was such a hassle.

Before, terrified of upsetting Robert and Gloria, she'd reply to Mateo's texts in a heartbeat, agonizing over every word. She'd pick up every call, desperate to keep him happy.

Now? She didn't give a damn.

*****

Mateo stared at his phone, willing it to buzz with Solana's reply. He'd been waiting ages.

He checked the screen—battery at 60%. 'Phone's fine,' he thought. 'What gives? Out of service? Nah, no way.'

He was a SVIP—his phone wasn't getting cut off over some unpaid bill.

'Solana's just asking for trouble,' he figured.

""Damn it!"" Mateo chucked the dice and cup onto the table, grabbed his phone, and stormed out.

Everyone in the presidential suite swapped confused looks, wondering what had set him off. The second he was gone, the room buzzed back to life.

Mateo stormed into the hallway, thumb jabbing at his phone as he called Solana three times—each one going straight to voicemail, every text left on read.

""Is she trying to screw herself over?"" he muttered, steaming.

He swore if she didn't pick up by the time he hit Embridge City, she'd find out what happens when he's pissed off.

Not one of the eight elevators was on the 28th floor. Mateo jabbed the buttons, smacked the panel, and threw in a solid kick for good measure, all while spamming Solana's phone with calls.

Just then, a group of people strolled out of a room down the hall, heading for a spot by the windows.

Mateo spotted another elevator tucked away. Still dialing, he marched over, muttering, ""Solana, you better pick up, or I swear—""

Before he could finish, someone blocked his path.

""What's your deal?"" Mateo snapped, looking up.

Two hulking bodyguards in sharp suits stared him down, stone-faced, not giving him a second thought.

The elevator doors started closing. Mateo lunged to hold them, barking, ""Do you even know who I am?""

Someone finally spoke. ""Other elevators are that way.""

Mateo gripped the door, not letting go. ""You must not get it—I'm a platinum member at Perce, and my dad's the chairman of Hickum Construction!""

""Hickum Construction?"" A young, cool voice echoed from inside the elevator.

The bodyguards stepped aside.

Mateo smirked, peering in.

A tall figure stood in the center, bodyguards practically bowing to him.

Mateo was a solid 6 feet, but this guy had to be 6'3"" at least. He stood there, one hand in his pocket, owning the space.

A black mask hid half his face, a single earring glinted on his right ear, and his eyes radiated cold swagger.

He locked eyes with Mateo and scoffed. ""Never heard of it.""

Chapter 5 The Real Heiress Is Here
Mateo had never seen anyone this brazen. He was about to lose it when the guy chuckled, ""Y'all know it?""

The bodyguards shook their heads. ""Nope,"" they said in unison.

'What the hell?! This is way too much—straight-up humiliating!' Mateo fumed to himself.

He cursed and charged. ""Time to learn about Hickum Construction, punk!""

*****

Meanwhile, Mateo's rented presidential suite was a full-on party, music thumping, drinks flowing.

Suddenly, someone burst in, snatched the mic, and shouted, ""Yo, trouble! Mateo's out there scrapping!""

The room froze. All eyes locked on the guy.

Someone snorted. ""Bet that dude's getting wrecked, right?""

""Yeah, probably begging at Mateo's feet!"" another laughed.

The mic guy's voice shook. ""Uh… Mateo's the one down.""

Laughter exploded.

Then someone blinked, confused. ""Wait—who's down?""

Before anyone could respond, security from the Perce Hotel marched in.

The head guard, face cold as ice, said, ""Mateo's VIP status is gone. He's banned. You've got five minutes to clear out, or we'll toss you.""

*****

Right then, Solana lounged on a plush bed, grinning as her phone buzzed with Mateo's desperate calls, texts, and WhatsApp pings.

She chuckled, picturing him fuming, ready to punch something.

But she wasn't scared one bit.

Her fingers grazed her pale ankle, and she called Hana, mentioning a twisted foot.

Hana's voice crackled with worry. ""Oh, Miss webb, hold tight! I'll grab some medicated oil. It'll be good by morning.""

Hana showed up fast. As she opened the door, Solana sat cross-legged, hands on cheeks, staring like she'd timed Hana's entrance.

Hana laughed, clutching her chest. ""Miss webb, you scared the crap outta me! Uh… we're out of ointment, but I'll run and get some.""

Just then, rain pounded the windows, drops smacking hard.

In her old life, Solana had pitied Hana, an older woman braving the rain, especially when Hana hesitated. She'd let it go, saying tomorrow was fine. But then Averie arrived, and everyone forgot Solana's swollen ankle, which ached for weeks.

Hana eyed the storm, wavering, but Solana cut in with a smile. ""Hana, grab the umbrella by the door. Don't catch a cold, alright?""

Hana nodded quick, hiding any annoyance. ""Got it, Miss Webb. Hang on.""Then she left.

Solana's smile turned cold. Every single thing Hana failed to do in that old life? Those debts were getting paid, one by one.

Solana knew Hana was in for a rough trip. She'd trashed Hana's umbrella on purpose before she left. With the storm raging outside, that thing was done for. So, Solana locked the door, hit the sack, and slept like a log.

Next morning, she stepped out and saw an ointment hanging on the doorknob, a sappy note from Hana tucked inside. Solana wasn't impressed. She balled up the note, tossed it in the trash, and chucked the oil onto her nightstand.

Downstairs, Hana was in the kitchen, cooking up a storm and sneezing her head off. Spotting Solana, she perked up. ""Hi, Miss Webb! Got back late last night—didn't wanna wake you. Left the ointment on your door. Foot's good now?""

""Yep, all good,"" Solana said, sliding into a chair to eat. ""Thanks, Hana.""

""Oh, this is my duty."" Hana grinned, grabbing a plate and fork. ""Mr. Webb dipped out early—said we've got company today."" She couldn't smell the ointment on Solana, which was weird, but she wasn't about to stir the pot.

Solana caught Hana sneaking off to the kitchen to blow her nose, probably popping meds. She looked like she was battling a cold and maybe a fever.

Robert paid well—real well—so plenty of folks were dying to take Hana's gig at the Webb house.

Solana remembered Hana never got sick, never took a day off. She was grinding hard to keep her job.

Solana didn't feel a twinge of guilt.

In her old life, when guests were coming, Solana would sit there, starving, waiting for Robert. Not anymore.

Hana's cooking? Absolute fire. In a great mood, Solana wolfed down two buttermilk biscuits and a big bowl of oatmeal.

Full and happy, she kicked back in the living room, watching the clock. As expected, a car engine growled outside.

""What are you doing down here, Mrs. Webb?"" Hana poked her head out, seeing Gloria shuffle downstairs, one hand on her forehead, the other gripping the banister.

Before, Solana would've rushed to help Gloria, who was too busy obsessing over Averie to notice Solana's sprained foot.

Now? She didn't budge, eyes locked on the front door.

Robert's voice cut through. ""Come on in.""

A slim figure followed him into the Webb villa. It was Averie—Solana's first glimpse from her old life.

In a plain white tee, jeans, and a ponytail, she looked nervous, scoping out the place like a scared mouse.

""There you are!"" Gloria lit up, hurrying over to grab Averie's hands, eyeing her like she was pure gold. ""Tired? Carsick? Eat yet?""

Averie, totally thrown, shook her head. Then her stomach growled—loud. Her face went tomato-red.

Robert jumped in. ""Hana, grab another plate.""

Gloria finally remembered Solana. ""Solana, get over here!""

Solana sauntered over, cool as a cucumber.

Averie turned and saw her—rocking a trendy puff-sleeve top, a sleek A-line skirt, and sparkly flats. Solana screamed money and style. Averie's outfit? Probably cost less than a coffee. She felt like nothing.

But knowing all this should've been hers? She hated this princess with every bone in her body.

Solana, unbothered, stepped up. Gotta admit, Averie was pretty—her eyes and brows were Robert's spitting image, her oval face all Gloria.

The resemblance was so obvious, Solana nearly laughed. No one would buy that she was Robert and Gloria's kid.

Robert and Gloria were sizing up the two girls. Solana felt it but didn't care one bit.

Gloria flashed a grin. ""Solana, this is… your dad's business friend's kid. She's staying a few days. Same age as you, so take care of her, 'kay?""

Averie forced a smile and stuck out her hand. ""Hey, I'm Averie.""

""Hi, I'm Solana,"" Solana said, shaking her hand like it was nothing.

Chapter 6 Feeling Like An Outsider
""Hey, let's not just stand here. Breakfast's ready, and Averie's probably starving,"" Robert said, waving everyone inside.

""Yeah, come on, Averie!"" Gloria chimed in, grabbing her arm with a big smile.

Solana watched the three of them, a sly grin tugging at her lips.

Last time around, she'd been too naive, swallowing the story that Averie was just some business friend's kid. She'd missed Gloria's teary eyes and Robert's oddly soft tone with Averie. Never thought to dig deeper.

The signs were all there—she'd just been too blind to see.

No DNA test yet, but this crew already acted like a happy little family. Solana was the only one not in on it.

In her previous life, they'd been so caught up in their warm fuzzies that they'd dumped the truth on her like a sucker punch.

Averie was already settled in, new life and all, while Solana was left clueless. That truth had nearly crushed her.

She'd only been eighteen.

""Miss Spencer,"" Hana said, setting down a palte and fork for Averie.

Robert frowned. ""It's Averie.""

Hana looked confused but nodded.

Solana smirked. 'Couldn't even handle ""Spencer,"" huh?'

Averie gawked at the breakfast spread, overwhelmed by the options. She swallowed hard, nervous about digging in and looking like a slob.

""Not eating?"" Gloria asked, piling food on Averie's plate with a warm smile, pointing out each dish.

""Tell Hana what you like. She'll whip it up again tomorrow,"" Robert added, actually sitting down for once instead of rushing off to ""work.""

Solana watched, stone-faced. From the outside, it was all so clear. The truth had been right in her face.

After breakfast, Robert took Gloria for a hospital checkup, but not before pulling Solana aside. ""Get along with Averie, alright?""

""Sure, Dad,"" Solana said sweetly. A shot like this? She'd definitely get along with Averie.

Hana lugged Averie's beat-up tote bag upstairs, clearly struggling. Nothing like the fancy Rimowa suitcases Solana had. Her eyes screamed disdain.

Solana saw it all. People didn't just turn shady—Hana had always been a status-chasing snob. Now, Solana could read her like a book.

'No use feeling sorry for her kind,' she thought.

Averie's room was right next to Solana's. Hana dragged Averie's bags in and dumped them by the wall.

""Sheets are fresh,"" she sneered. ""But keep that bag off the bed, got it?""

Averie's face flashed red, then pale, like she might cry any second.

""Hana, go do your thing downstairs,"" Solana said, noticing her sour vibe. ""My parents are out. Take a break if you're not feeling it.""

Hana practically worshipped her with a look and scurried off.

Averie turned to see Solana leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, giving off major boss energy. Robert had sworn the girl at his family was sweet and chill. Yeah, right. Solana was anything but.

Solana nodded at the bag by the wall. ""You unpacking or what?""

Averie's shoulders twitched. Next to this glamorous girl who outshone her by a mile, she couldn't bear to pull out her shabby clothes and look like a fool.

She forced a wobbly smile. ""I'll… deal with it later. Didn't Mr. Webb say you'd show me around? Can we do that now?""

""Up to you,"" Solana said, already walking off.

Averie trailed behind, gawking like she'd stepped into a mansion. Everything was shiny, new, begging for a second glance. But when Solana looked back, Averie froze, awkwardness oozing from every fidget.

So, Averie wasn't always that loud, cocky type.

'When did that shy small-town girl disappear? Probably after that paternity test,' Solana thought, smirking.

After looping back, Solana flung open her bedroom door and stepped aside. ""My room. Wanna peek? Go ahead.""

Averie's jaw dropped. A princess bed fit for royalty, sleek furniture, a glitzy crystal lamp—the closet alone was twice her old room. It was a life she couldn't even dream of.

'Should've been mine.' The thought hit like a punch.

Averie's fists clenched, jealousy and resentment burning through her like wildfire.

Behind her, Solana's voice hit Averie like a jab. ""So, your dad's some hotshot friend of my dad's? What's your family's deal?""

Averie's stomach knotted. 'My dad? Just a sweaty factory grunt. Say that out loud? Hard pass.'

Biting her lip hard, Averie was convinced Solana was trying to humiliate her. No way was she gonna let that happen.

Sneaking a glance at Solana, Averie smirked inwardly. 'You're about to choke on that attitude, princess.'

She sucked in a breath. ""You'll find out soon enough.""

Solana didn't bat an eye, brushing it off. ""Cool. Where do you live, then?""

Averie's hands shook with rage. Spill her address? Let Solana roast her for her Podunk roots? No way.

'Who does Solana think she is, acting like the queen of this house?' she thought. 'Does this chick really think I am just some rando kid of her dad's buddy?'

Averie shot her an icy stare. 'Wait till I'm the real Webb heiress. I'll wipe that smug look off your face.'

""What, you blanking on your own address?"" Solana teased, stepping closer.

Solana's mind raced. She was done with the Webb family's drama. All she wanted was to find her real parents and run to them.

Averie's lips trembled, her face pale as death. That day at the hospital, when she'd overheard the Webbs spill the life-altering truth, she'd ghosted her small-town folks. Lied about

She'd lied, saying she was crashing at a friend's to slip into the city.

She couldn't deny it—her poor parents had always been good to her. But still, she wasn't going back.

'Who'd ditch being a rich heiress for that?' she thought.

No way was she spilling her address. Not until this was locked down. Her country parents couldn't know squat.

""I… I'm beat. I'm gonna crash in my room,"" Averie mumbled, spinning around too fast. Her knee smashed into the bed frame with a nasty thud. She yelped, dropping to the floor, clutching her leg.

""Whoa, you okay?"" Solana grabbed some medicinal oil from the nightstand. ""Here, use this. Hana got it special.""

The second Averie heard Hana's name—that snarky maid who always had a jab ready—she felt a wave of disgust. She grabbed the ointment, ""accidentally"" letting it slip into the trash can.

""Oh, shoot! My bad!""Averie stammered, bolting up. ""I don't need it. I'm good. Gotta go.""

Solana watched her scurry off, a sly grin creeping up.

I was rushing through the pouring rain to get to the mansion—another grueling day as a live-in nanny for $100,000 a day, plus that sweet $999,999 sushi dinner I had arranged per his special request. I was actually feeling good about finally hitting my savings goal when I heard voices drifting from the living room.  
  
""Dude, she really thinks you're broke and paralyzed from that accident? And she's been busting her ass cleaning houses just to pay your medical bills?""  
  
""Right? Vivienne Langston even pawned her mom's jewelry to cover your 'therapy sessions.' If she knew you were worth billions and basically royalty on the Upper East Side, she'd lose her mind.""  
  
Damien Whitlock chuckled, ice clinking in his glass.  
  
""Girls like her... they're natural servants, you know? It's what they're good at.""  
  
""Besides, she deserved it. Always showing up Chloe in school, making her look bad. This is just evening the score.""  
  
I stood there getting soaked, the rain mixing with my tears as everything finally clicked.  
  
Two years. Two years of him pretending to be disabled—all so he could help his precious childhood princess Chloe Vesper get back at me.  
  
The wheelchair, the sob story about his dead parents, those moments when he'd break down crying—every single thing had been one massive lie.  
  
I pulled out my phone with shaking hands and dialed the number I'd been avoiding.  
  
""Dad? It's me. You win. I'll do the arranged marriage.""  
  
I ended the call with my dad, and Chloe's voice floated out from inside the mansion.  
  
""My baby Damien loves me so much, getting back at that little bitch for me. God, I'm so happy.""  
  
Her manicured fingers tilted his chin up toward her.  
  
That's when I saw it—my mother's ring sparkling on her finger.  
  
Damien smirked and playfully nipped at her fingertip.  
  
""You're trouble, you know that?""  
  
I could see his legs—the ones that were supposed to be paralyzed—casually stretched out and crossed on the coffee table like he didn't have a care in the world.  
  
That thick white cast that had been lying to me for two years looked absolutely ridiculous under the chandelier light.  
  
I clutched my nanny bag and pounded on the door.  
  
Every single person in that room whipped their heads toward me.  
  
The party went dead silent.  
  
I walked straight toward Damien, my soaked sneakers squeaking against their fancy marble floor with every step.  
  
Damien's voice cracked, his eyes darting around like a cornered animal.  
  
""What the hell are you doing here?""  
  
""I was just... this is just a casual hangout with friends...""  
  
I didn't even look at him. My eyes were locked on that ring.  
  
""Give me back my ring.""  
  
Damien's cocky grin completely disappeared—clearly he wasn't expecting me to sound so ice-cold.  
  
He rolled his wheelchair closer, trying to pull that soft, caring voice he always used to manipulate me. ""Viv, baby, just listen to me—""  
  
""Listen to what?""  
  
I cut him off, my mouth twisting into something bitter and ugly.  
  
""About how you generously sold my mom's ring to your girlfriend for top dollar?""  
  
""Or maybe about how your dead legs just miraculously started working again?""  
  
All the blood drained from Damien's face. His mouth opened and closed like a fish.  
  
The silence was deafening until Chloe burst out laughing.  
  
She strutted over in her designer heels, making sure to wave that ring right in my face.  
  
""This ring? Oh honey, this was a gift from Damien. What, you jealous? Want it back?""  
  
She really dragged out ""gift from Damien,"" her eyes absolutely glowing with satisfaction.  
  
Damien looked like he was going to throw up. ""Chloe, shut up! Viv, she doesn't—""  
  
""She doesn't what?"" Chloe snapped at him. She looked me up and down like I was trash, taking in my soaked nanny uniform.  
  
""You want your precious ring back? Sure thing, sweetheart. But I'm not giving you charity here. I've been wearing it, so it's used goods now. Tell you what—I'm feeling generous today. Half a million dollars. Cash. Right now. Then you can have your little ring back.""  
  
Five hundred thousand?  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After I cut ties with my dad, I'd already spent every penny I had trying to pay for Damien's ""medical treatment."" I'd pawned all of my mom's belongings, and now I couldn't even scrape together five hundred bucks, let alone five hundred thousand.  
  
I stared at her smug face, then looked at Damien. He wouldn't even meet my eyes—just sat there letting Chloe torture me.  
  
My heart felt crushed. Whatever stupid fantasy I'd been holding onto about our past just died right there.  
  
""Fine.""  
  
""I'll buy it.""  
  
I just wanted my mom's ring back. Then I'd never have to see any of these people again.  
  
""You'll buy it?""  
  
Chloe started laughing like I'd just told the world's funniest joke.  
  
Then she pointed at the thermal bag I was still holding—the one with fifteen grand worth of premium sushi.  
  
""You couldn't make half a million in your whole pathetic life! Look at what you're carrying—this fancy-ass sushi? Have you ever even tasted food this expensive? You think you deserve it?""  
  
Before I could react, she lunged forward and ripped the bag out of my hands, then slammed it down on the marble floor.  
  
CRASH!  
  
The wooden container exploded on impact. Perfectly arranged sashimi, caviar, and wagyu beef scattered everywhere across their pristine floor.  
  
Chloe stared down at the mess, then stepped on a piece of expensive tuna with her stiletto and ground it into the marble.  
  
""See that? Fifteen thousand dollars of sushi, and I just threw it away like garbage! You could never do this, could you? You're too broke and pathetic!""  
  
""You'll never make enough money to eat food like this. You can only smell it. That's the difference between us, got it?""  
  
The whole room erupted in nasty laughter.  
  
""Right? Some nanny thinking she can compete with Chloe!""  
  
""Look at her! Born to be poor. She says she'll pay half a mil? Maybe if she finds some old sugar daddy!""  
  
""True, she's got that innocent look old perverts love.""  
  
Chloe soaked up every word, getting more vicious by the second.  
  
She looked down at the ring on her finger, then back at my soaked, pathetic appearance.  
  
""Damien said this ring was supposed to be worth something, but you're dirt poor, so even if it was expensive once, it's probably just cheap trash, right?""  
  
""Only someone like you would treat junk like treasure.""  
  
As she spoke, she twisted the ring between her fingers. Then, before anyone—including Damien—could react, she yanked open the glass door and hurled the ring outside.  
  
It flew through the rain and landed with a splash in the rushing water beside the mansion.  
  
""NO!""  
  
That was the last thing my mom had left me!  
  
My body moved before my brain could think. I threw myself toward the balcony, ready to jump over the railing into that freezing water.  
  
""Viv!""  
  
Damien suddenly shot up from his wheelchair!  
  
Moving like a guy who'd never been paralyzed a day in his life!  
  
He lunged forward and grabbed me around the waist, dragging me back from the railing.  
  
""Let me go! Damien, let me GO!""  
  
I fought him desperately, watching helplessly as the muddy water swallowed up my mother's ring.  
  
Cold rain and hot tears mixed together, blurring my vision.  
  
""Calm down! You're gonna kill yourself over some stupid ring?!""  
  
Damien's voice had panic in it, but mostly just irritation.  
  
Stupid ring?  
  
That was the only thing my mother left me!  
  
And his precious Chloe had just thrown it away like garbage!  
  
All my anger, sadness, and humiliation turned into something cold and dead.  
  
I stopped struggling and went limp in his arms, my body stiff and cold.  
  
""We're done.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My voice was terrifyingly calm.  
  
Damien's body went rigid, then he acted like he'd heard some ridiculous joke.  
  
""Viv, come on! Don't be dramatic! I know you're upset about the ring—I'll make Chloe apologize! We can—""  
  
""I'm not being dramatic.""  
  
I cut him off, prying his fingers away from my waist one by one.  
  
I turned around and looked straight at his face—the face that now made me sick.  
  
""Damien, aren't you tired of this act after two years? My mom's ring is gone, and whatever I felt for you is gone too. How long are you planning to keep playing me?""  
  
His eyes darted around, and instantly he put on that familiar, vulnerable expression I knew so well.  
  
""Viv, what are you talking about? My legs really were messed up—the treatment just worked better than expected... Are you really going to abandon me now? I knew it—you've always been disgusted by me, always wanted to leave me!""  
  
He was trying to manipulate me again with the whole ""disabled and abandoned"" routine.  
  
Watching his perfect performance, I just felt disgusted.  
  
I didn't explain. I didn't have the energy to say another word to him.  
  
I just bent down and picked up the dirty, empty delivery bag from the floor.  
  
Without looking at him or the crowd of assholes on the terrace, I turned around and walked into the pouring rain.  
  
Behind me, I heard Chloe's sickeningly sweet voice:  
  
""Damien, the truth's out—so what? You're not actually worried about that crazy bitch, are you?""  
  
""Don't tell me you, a billionaire heir, actually fell for some delivery girl?""  
  
I didn't hear Damien's answer.  
  
Since we were done, I didn't need to keep being a nanny either.  
  
I called my agency to quit.  
  
My boss was shocked:  
  
""Vivienne? What's wrong? You were doing great—why quit so suddenly? Aren't you saving money for your boyfriend's treatment?""  
  
""He's better,"" I said, forcing a smile. ""Completely better.""  
  
""Oh wow! That's amazing!""  
  
My boss sounded so relieved. ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? He's going to treat you so much better now! All that hard work paid off!""  
  
Paid off?  
  
I laughed bitterly to myself.  
  
Yeah, Damien was the one who got me that exhausting, humiliating job in the first place.  
  
He said he wanted to ""help me contribute,"" but really it was just to make me ""suffer a little"" and get revenge for his precious Chloe.  
  
Well, at least it was all over now.  
  
I packed up everything, and the next day I went to the most luxurious hotel in the city.  
  
I dragged my suitcases through the lobby, looking completely out of place. Everyone was staring at me.  
  
""Well, well, well! Look who it is—our hardworking 'Nanny Queen', Vivienne!""  
  
That sharp, nasty voice I knew way too well came from behind me.  
  
It was Chloe.  
  
She and her crew of friends were here too.  
  
I kept walking, but Chloe wasn't going to let me go. She and her friends surrounded me like I was some zoo animal.  
  
""Look what we have here!""  
  
Chloe dramatically pinched her nose like I smelled bad.  
  
""How does some delivery girl dare walk into the Grandview International? Security! Security! Is this hotel's standards really this low now? You're letting any trash in here? Disgusting!""  
  
Her friends immediately joined in:  
  
""Right? She's so grimy—don't let her dirty the carpet!""  
  
""Chloe, remember? She's the one who's so high and mighty, saying she doesn't care about money! What happened—her crippled boyfriend just dumped her and now she's already here hunting for sugar daddies?""  
  
Their shrill laughter echoed through the lobby.  
  
I listened to their twisted lies, staring at Chloe coldly.  
  
""Get lost.""  
  
""You're telling me to get lost? Ha!"" Chloe's face darkened, and she suddenly shoved me hard!

1m09y7j,https://i.redd.it/1bnsagvu9zcf1.jpeg,Published my first experimental fiction book on kindle!,"After years of overthinking, I finally wrote and self-published a novella on Kindle! Here's the synopsis:

Home. Self. Purpose. What happens when you lose sense of all things that make you you?

Notes on Black Things follows a 30-something woman in contemporary India whose return to her childhood house after a decade away unearths forgotten memories and textures of grief that makes her question everything she knows. Through standalone vignettes, you are invited to explore the narrator’s inner world as she reorients herself to the old-new life she finds herself in, and a self she no longer fully recognises. Triggered by inane black things like hair, coffee, cassettes, a TV screen, burnt chicken, black in these stories isn't just a colour; it depicts a wound, a foreshadow, a metaphor for what is unsaid or buried.

Notes on Black Things seeks to give voice to urban Indian women navigating life that feels stretched thin between newfound freedom and familial expectations in the sociocultural backdrop of a changing urban middle class. This is for readers who know or are struggling with a deep sense of unbelonging, fatigued by the performance of healing, and the burden of holding it together. It is not a story of hero or victim, of triumph or failure, but is a reckoning of what it means to make peace with yourself, despite your contradictions and failures.

I wake up in the morning feeling semi-okay. Appropriately groggy. But I’m so used to having a coffee and a cigarette in the morning, as if they get things “moving”. Once Im done smoking I feel like shit for 15 minutes and nothing makes me feel better. Neither lying down nor walking nor sleeping. Sometimes I feel lightheaded. But I can’t beat this habit, because of course, the habit and the addiction, and the added digestive benefits. Why do I feel like this in the morning? 

Bonus info: every time I’ve tried to quit, my digestive system suffered, which is what immediately got me back to smoking. 
I smoke less than 10 cigarettes. Sometimes as little as 3-4, but can’t beat it entirely. Longest I’ve gone without smoking was 2 months, then I took a drag and the rest was history. Clearly I’m not serious enough about quitting yet. ",1,1752559009.0,quittingsmoking,0,1.0,False

The biggest lie I have ever told is that I forgive you. It wasn’t a lie when those words left my mouth. I don’t hold anything against you. It was a lie when I told myself it was the Truth. I have spent my entire life lying to myself, screaming at myself a lie that goes, we are fine. And I seem to be the only one convinced of this. I seem to be the only one who believes that I am ok. I can see it on the faces of everyone around me. I can hear it behind the questions they ask of how my day is going and did I sleep well. I’ve lied in bed for so long that I’ve slept, well. What happens when I find out the truth. What happens when my heart finds out my brain has been sending false reports and the rumors of pain make it to my chest. To tell you the Truth I’m terrified of what will happen when the memories you have given me are leaked to the heart that’s kept on beating because the brain told it she didn’t mean that.

Leaves falling with the swish of the breeze. tik tik tik tik the watch clicks on the night stand where it sits. A dogs bark in the distance fits into the thin waves of chaos echoing as the church bells echo rings and a dozen birds sing the neighbors vacuums screams as she spring cleans except for the screams of the rusty door springs. It’s silent or so it seems on the outside I’m being quiet. But my mind is ripping at the seams ten songs and 29 scenes replays of every time friend lied to me. Maybe me it’s. Like loose change my mind builds sandcastles of change it scrambles to make sense of why this always happens to be. Thoughts are crying What could I do so people would like me. While others yell What isn’t there to like about me. Trying to speak up to the angry mob inside me. Should I talk to someone. Till they merge and proclaim an insane asylum’s more than likely. And so I just sit here and fight quietly today’s not the day but tomorrow might be.

And just like that it was all the same. Profanely enraged the get the fuck out of my way. This is why you do what I say. I swear with you it’s every day. That’s right shut down and walk away. I thought this would be a different story. I guess I’ll pop the cap and pour me another.

I wish I could be the man that everyone sees me trying to be I get quiet because inside of me there is a 10 year old boy shaking quietly. I’m silent because thats how you don’t find out what it means to have something to cry about. Look me in my eyes while I’m talking to you. DID YOU PISS THE FUCKING BED AGAIN. Kids pray for pony’s and puppy’s when they are ten I prayed begged god to keep my siblings safe and to please let it end. I pissed the bed because every night my tears would soak the pillow at each days end. Your monster was In your closet mine was in my head. I had Sunset lead thoughts. A preteen alive because your parents don’t have money to clean a ceiling or pay for a pinewood box let alone a cemetery plot. Never a boy scout but I know my knots. And one that I thought about a lot. Undefeated In the fights no one knows I fought. Just a little weaker and I’d be at thirteen years of rot. The thoughts arnt gone but I’ve learned a-lot. Focus on the sunrise you might be surprised if you give today a shot. And just keep smiling even if it takes all you got.

I wish I could be the man that everyone sees me trying to be I get quiet because inside of me there is a 10 year old boy shaking quietly. I’m silent because thats how you don’t find out what it means to have something to cry about. Look me in my eyes while I’m talking to you. Side sleeper from a back that was blue. It’s not my fists that’s where bruised Undefeated In the fights no one knows I fought. Just a little weaker and I’d be at thirteen years of rot. Ii say im stronger now but I still have the thoughts people only know who I try to be And so I just sit here and fight quietly today’s not the day but tomorrow might be.

The sun is fading behind clouds of red and purple. Memories of good times like a childhood summer day flood the mind. Echoed laughter muffled from the constant ringing adult ears. Oh how I wish to be that child again. And feel the warmth and love unconditional that I so desperately wanted to grow out of. But like that summer day with the suns sweet rays setting I feel the darkness coming through from behind. And when those rays fade to black. I am reminded of the one thing I lack. Until the next sunrise I’ll keep treading trying to stay alive Until the next sunrise.

Up hill both ways

Up hill both ways every day rain or shine
miles added every time
and time again and again
a punk kid smirked from a grandiose story
Of the treacherous red brick road he strolled building a life for him and his wife.
Six feet of snow one shovel
7 days of working doubles
Laying sky scraping towers piece by piece
brick by brick he built his life for him and his wife
like his school walk trip up hill both ways.
watch your step be careful not to slip
Remember its not just a sip.
every errand trip he told the same old stories to the same young kid.
Watch for wolves and protect your sheep.
I always wondered why he would never sleep cracked hands at the crack of dawn wrapped around a stained mug of black coffee
he’s seen every sun rise
with every weather channel outlook
looking for a hot dry day
a man who prays to god to keep the rain away.

Until one day

Callused hands strain to pick a penny to pinch
like the nerves in my back.
the load of life and bills and cost of meals stacked. higher than the light that’s been out for a week.
just as I sit hoping to drift off to sleep.
drip drip drip from the kitchen sink leaking.
Sinking in Warm scotch Im drinking
the ice makers broke.
Like the seal on another makers mark bottle it’s another day’s problem like the throttle cable broken so i’ve been walking and
i swear to god that walk is uphill both ways
and gets longer every day.
Is the same people calling about bills
wanting their money a pack of wolves
and one girl who thinks i’m funny
who doesn’t see the monster in me from my morning cans of energy i drink
while i check the weather for today and pray it doesn’t rain
this check pays to keep the lights working
like the check engine light on the way to work is.
I conversate but call it praying,
morning talks with god
i’ve asked him to explain eight days this week
how i can build a life, a life like…

a life like my grandfathers

the light turned green above me.
The words of a man who never let a conversation end
Without telling me he loved me.
Begging god for answers
To tests he’s already shown me.
Shovel snow not ice,
If you measure once you’ll cut twice,
Banking on weather is worse than dice.
One mouse is a hundred mice.
One steak or a bag of rice.
The same day doesn’t come twice.

1m09q1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/writersmakingfriends/comments/1m09q1v/what_i_wrote_so_far_on_the_cult_of_windfield/,What I wrote so far on The Cult of Windfield - Feedback welcome," Introduction 

Windfield, Missouri. A peaceful town with four thousand friendly, kind and familiar faces. Tree-lined streets, old brick buildings, and the warm glow of porch lights greet visitors and residents alike. Here, neighbors know each other by name, and the hum of everyday life carries a comforting rhythm. Farmers tending their fields, children playing in the parks, and families gathering for Sunday dinners. 

 

But beneath this calm surface, shadows stir. Whispers float through the night air, unheard by most but felt by some... a chill where there should be warmth, a glance just a little too long, and secrets tucked behind closed doors. The wind carries faint echoes of something sinister, waiting patiently in the quiet corners of Windfield. 

 

This is a town where appearances deceive, and not everyone is as they seem. 

 

In Windfield, life moves at its own gentle pace. The town square, with its century-old clock tower, stands as a silent witness to generations of celebrations and tragedies alike. Every Friday night, the local diner fills with laughter and chatter, the clinking of coffee cups mixing with the hum of old jukebox tunes. 

 

Yet, when the sun dips below the horizon, a different rhythm takes hold. Streetlamps flicker uncertainly, and the wind whispers through the cracked windows of abandoned houses on the town’s edge. Some residents swear they hear distant chanting carried by the breeze, faint but unmistakable, just beyond the edge of hearing. 

 

No one talks about it openly. Fear and denial weave a thick veil over the town’s darker truths. But those who listen closely know that beneath Windfield’s friendly smile lies a secret, dark and hungry, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself. 

 

But some secrets, no matter how deeply buried, have a way of clawing their way back to the surface. In Windfield, the friendly faces hide dark intentions, and the line between friend and foe is about to blur forever. 

 

For Alex, and for everyone caught in the town’s quiet, yet tight and unforgiving grip, nothing will ever be the same again. 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter 1 

Nightfall 

You hear Windfield whisper only once. You don’t live to hear it again... 

 

In 1898, in the darkest shadows of Windfield, Missouri, a secret society was born. Not one made from the nobility or the clergy, but the outcasts, outlaws and killers. They called themselves the Society of the Night.  

 

In the waning days of a harsh autumn in 1898, when the wind bit sharper and the nights grew longer, a handful of Windfield’s most forgotten souls gathered in the ruins of an old chapel on the edge of town. These were men and women who had been cast aside. Thieves, drifters, killers, and those whispered about behind closed doors. But in their exile, they found strength in shared secrets and bitterness towards a town that refused to remember them. 

 

Bound by blood and shadow, they forged the Society of the Night, a pact to claim what had been denied, to carve power from the darkness itself. Their rituals were whispered about only in the blackest corners, their gatherings marked by flickering candlelight and chants that seemed to seep into the very earth beneath Windfield. 

 

No one outside dared speak their name. But those who looked too closely at Windfield’s history found an unsettling pattern. Disappearances, strange symbols carved into tree bark, and the ever-present chill that settled in the town’s very bones. 

 

The Society thrived in silence, a parasite feeding on fear and secrecy, waiting for the moment when Windfield would belong to them entirely. 

 

The Society was thought to have gone extinct in 1922, but it would resurface one hundred years later to show Windfield once more that their town’s history cannot be buried for long... 

 

“All hail Satan!” a tall man shouted and looked up at the inverted cross. Alex’s eyes jolted open, his muscles tried to break free from the ropes tied to his ankles and wrists. He had no T-shirt and was drenched in sweat as if he went through fire. Three or four figures stood behind the tall man with black hair and a haunting, villainous, possessed stare. He slowly reached for a goat skull and put it over Alex’s head while he screamed. “May you rot in Hell until the end of times!” the menacing man shouted in his deep, demonic voice. He lifted an ancient-looking dagger with the initials ‘A.L.’ engraved on the blade. Just as the dagger was about to pierce Alex, who was lying on a stone altar, the alarm clock went off. 

 

Alex’s brown eyes jolted open, he was all sweating. “Damn...” he muttered while clutching his head. “This is the sixth time this month...” he quietly reacted. This was the sixth time that September that Alex had such a dream about being sacrificed to a satanic cult.  

 

The cold breeze swept through the bedroom and played with the blue curtains on the windows. Alex removed his blue satin sheets and put on his plaid brown slippers which had certainly seen better days.  

 

The room wasn’t big. It had a large bed with blue sheets and pillows, a reddish carpet on the floor and an old white closet in the corner, next to the small, fifteen-year-old television on the drawer.  

 

“I’m either losing my mind or a satanic cult has possessed my dreams.” Alex told himself while the cold breeze was brushing against his skin like ice. He heard children playing outside. As he went to close the window, a faint, almost unreadable whisper echoed through the room. “Sydney...” he heard the whisper. At first, he turned around, but no one was there. “I’m losing my fucking mind...” he dismissed the whisper as him being paranoid and tired.

Brewing Parameters:
- 15g of washed light roast coffee
- 95 degrees Celsius water

I went with a 2 minute bloom as per lance’s recipe, and poured up to 255ml after the bloom. 

The brew tasted sweet when cooled, but had a slight bitter aftertaste (albeit not unbearable) the only obvious problem I had was: while trying to pour at a rate of 6-8g/s, my solo dripper filled up fast, and often at times I had to stop pouring, wait for the water to drain, then continue pouring again, which isn’t ideal.

1m09oit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1m09oit/anyone_else_been_shocked_like_this/,Anyone else been shocked like this?,"So I was working with a brand a while back (an online store for a coffee company). The USP of the coffee company was super-high caffeine.

The owners told me that the angle they were selling was that this was like an energy drink alternative. That younger people (20-30 year olds) were who they were shooting for.

Gym-goers, gamers and just generally active people.

I took their word for it, and after about 8 months of doing pretty much everything under the sun, new ads, landing pages, rebranding, influencers etc. etc - we just weren't seeing the return we needed to make things profitable.

After doing a *lot* of research and reading, I felt like we needed to challenge the customer persona we were going after.

So, we did some digging and after collecting more customer information were honestly totally shocked.

The buying demographic for 80% of sales was 50+ YEAR OLDS.

They were so far off with their assumption as to who they were selling to it was crazy.

The problem was, I think *some* people from all age brackets had tried and liked the product - but I think they just took any signal from that and ran with it to match their assumptions.

The result was that all marketing was just totally off base and made it way more expensive than it needed to be, because it was designed for the wrong people.

I'm super curious, has anyone else experienced anything at all similar to this?? And if so - what happened and how did you find out?",2,1752558083.0,ecommerce,4,0.75,False

1m09nn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1m09nn0/the_sacrifice_i_place_on_your_alter/,The sacrifice I place on your alter,"I don't know what to do anymore. I've played this game so long I don't know how to live anymore. I'm so lonely I don't even feel human. No one should live this long without feeling the loving embrace of another. Now it's been so long that the thought scares me to try. What do I do with that? 

I want this choice to mean something to you. I want to pour this 3yrs of longing into you. I want it to be this magical elixir that heals things between us. I really feel like it could if you'd let it. I want it to be be a sacrifice I lay upon your alter. Something you choose to sanctify and anoint me with moisture of your kiss. The gentle warmth of your embrace. The blooming heat that will grow like a fanned fire between us. Burning away our pains in its purifying testimony. Is so wrong to seek to worship and rejoice with you so? 

I realize now this wasn't just the sacrifice of my body to atone for my sins. This was an outright refusal to live without you. To disallow myself joy and to disavow human connection. Something you know as a person I need in order to function. If I were to choose to live again then by chance I become embroiled in life. I would be faced with choices where I have to admit you are not there and do not care at all what I do. By playing the game and believing in this fantasy I have been able to keep you first in my heart. 

In doing so I have changed integrally deep down to my bones and I like this new me. I like the depth I find   The clarity with which I see. The ability to know and understand you so well. Is this the real reward I glean from my chosen celibacy? Is it not supposed to be you? Would I loose it the second I embrace another? Your anointing and it's chance at beautiful reunion ripped from the pages already written in the magic scrolls of the universe. 

What do I do? Do I choose to live and put myself upon a new path that takes me further away from you? Do I remain to disallow and disavow these things I find myself yearning for more and more now. In doing so I some regards I remain unworthy. My life remains unstable. I remain disfunctional. But can my love for you truly be tested untill I am met with a choice in which I choose you first over another? When doing that would be to intentionally harm someone willing to love me for who I am. Surely that can't be the answer. My karmic debt is to high as it is. 
Would it not rip me apart as it did you? 

So I don't know what to do. I don't want to let go of the belief in my heart. What I know is the truth of all this and if you. Logic says one thing and the heart says another. I know when it comes to love logic does does not rule. Love is blind and it chooses as it will. It doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't have to be pretty. It's isn't always rainbows and sunshine. When it comes to loving someone being willing to suffer their storm is every bit as beautiful as some hopeless romantic fools desperate antics to get their attention. 

How do I express to you the beauty I have found in the storm? How can I get through to you how much more I love you for having gone through the storm for you? The story of us could be written and found within pages of any romance novel. Keeping men and women on the edge of their seat and begging for our long awaited reunion. So easily the truth that we have lived would inspire tears to flow and in their collective make wonderus rivers. Both Serene and mighty. The passion in our love making make women wet and men stiff and uncomfortable. All this and more is the truth we have lived thus far. So how do I just say enough and lay down my sword? How do I quit and simply move on? How do I hold another and not feel so empty compared to how I felt with you? Tell me Sweetness, My Empress Magnificent, what is it that should do? 

Therein lies another problem. How do I believe you when you do. Our history is riddled with examples of you saying one thing sincere and you could but in your heart you wanted to say something vastly different. You would say something and hope that I didn't listen. Hope that I saw through you guise and did something that would make your heart sing. Now that I can do just that the ability is wasted . Like some cruel joke played on us by life just to mock us. 

All I know is that with every day that goes by I only love you more. The desire and temptation grows and grows to the point it feels like it could be bottled and sold. You make me sweat with fever from dreams. Those same dreams becomes frightful and I wake up in cold sweats. Sometimes though , oh the sometimes when they are so sweet and I wake rock hard and so wanting. How do I accept any other in your place. When all I want is you? 

I need your comfort. I need your embrace. I need the closeness of you near to me. I need answers to so many questions about what we are to each other. About what we once were. I need confirmation and I strive for acceptance. I know now the work has been geuines and I know I am worthy. Would you though be kind and bestow on me your grace or would you be cruel and push me away while silently feeling something so much different? 

You put up the boundary and I honor it still. So I come to this place and perform my heart's ambitions on stage for the world to see and to swoon. These words are not for them. These emotions are meant to be shared between only you and I. I have no other choice. I have to release them out of me. I have to give them definition and form and manifest them. They are not truly understood in me untill I author them in some form of prose. So I come here and I leave my mark upon the world hoping they will be a flag you will know. Hoping you see that it is not some freshman love letter but an entire universe I built for us to exist in. A place where you can see into me without having to question the truth of your feelings for me. In this I mean only for it to be a gift to and a way to heal. A way to restore things I broke inside of you. How I wish you felt the same need in you. 

I can't undo the past. I can't erase it or hide it. We went through something terrible. We did terrible things to each other. Some were instigated by others who felt the need to interject themselves into our life. Yes we failed each other and drank of their poison. I don't know why this happened. I don't why we were picked to endure this. I know what I feel in my heart.  Some people say God will put upon you more than you are able to endure. I feel a connection in that. Because I have been to the brink of insanity and maybe even past it. Yet I am still here and better for having gone through this to come out the other side. In many religions there is a belief that in order to be the shaman, the witch doctor, the druid, or holy man you have to have been scarred by life tragically and survived. I understand that now. I know what it's like to feel different from others. To feel Profound for having gone something so horrible and kept intact my core beliefs. I have stumbled in my integrity, and fallen over my morals. I have sinned and wallowed in darkness. Yet no matter the attempts of forked tongues, they promises made with malice, I have never let the darkness in to rule me. I have played on the borders. I have fallen into the abyss and from there I did things that were so unlike me. I saw the aftermath and I abhor the reality of my actions. I don't need the same from you. I know what I am and I know what I am not. I am not evil and I am a good man. I didn't have reason to believe in myself then standing in your shadow. Now though I do and your shadow is not where I choose to be. It is time for you to look and what you have made of me. What your love has inspired. 

More than that. It is time for you to let go of the burdens. To cut away the barb wire you surround yourself with. To cast off the chains and let me use this key that you gave me. It is time to come down from your tower. I have seen your signals. So you to turn your tower into a lighthouse. You need not fear in this. There is no malice. I know I have said before to believe in me. You know the truth and you know the difference. You can see the work I have done. I didn't seek to be beside you without going through the journey to get there this time. This time I chose you first everyday. I will not forget and I will not just stand there victorious. I understand now our love is a garden and it needs constant attention or the weeds will overgrow all the good intentions. In truth of this before I was more than guilty. Let me show you I have learned my lesson. 

I have accepted the accountability for my actions. I have faced the mirror and saw the ugly reflection. I have admitted what I became and the damage I caused to those who suffered to love me. I have worn my shame and as I do my heart. My their on my sleeve. For all to see. I may have sought to run once upon a time. I may have sought the easy way out to escape. In my head I thought what a romantic end to a tragic to story. To die for someone you love. I know now I was only wanting to hurt you and to run from something I was ashamed of. 

Let me tell you the irony of life. Just the other day I found out someone I knew had killed themself. I don't know the full story. I do know that he had reason to be ashamed. Something he did sent him to court just days after his child arrived in this world. I didn't know any of this and I watched his much younger wife who had list her her husband and had her child taken by DCFS. Sit there and in her loss get high into oblivion. Crying and sobbing and cursing the world. I was sober as a jay bird and disgusted with her use. Yet I myself have done the same in the past. Now though I see what his choice has done. What he left behind and how broken the world is not for just her but his child. Let me tell you it is not Romantic. Not at all. I am beyond ashamed that I thought so. That I almost did this to you so long ago. It is a horror and a terrible sentence I almost bestowed on you. I was hurt and out of my mind as I had sought to get high to cope with it. I saw no other answer and it seemed so romantic. The one thing I could do for you and get it right. 

I was wrong. I was choosing the easy way out. The path that took the least work. The one that meant I didn't have to face you or all the things I have since the day I survived. I wasn't choosing you at all. I was choosing myself over your pain. I had been all along with every excuse I made to continue my behavior. Blaming you for the distance between us. Faulting you for the choices you made. When I left you no option and in truth you meant them to be a warning. A reason to stand up and be a man. To stop retreating into my childhood truama and to meet you were you were. Someone had to be the bigger person and to stop the vicious cycle from repeating. I am sorry that method I chose burned down our life and scarred the memories of our love. I am more sorry than you will ever understand or know. Because I live in those memories as painful as they are just to be with you once more. Like watching a movie youve seen over and over and you sit there begging them not to go upstairs. That's how I sit and watch the horror of what became our life and our love. Knowing now what we didn't know then. All the places we went wrong, and all the reasons we couldn't see then. 

So life's irony. To look at the reality of my choices have done. To see what pain I would have caused you had I not survived. To be disgusted by seeing someone make the same choices I did and to sit there and get high. Even more so that I had no clue if his pain because I was so caught up in my own. How I could of shared with him a few words to inspire him not to. In truth no one knew and he did it from a jail cell. I know I and no one is at fault. Still me being me I feel some guilt cause that's just how I am. Something you used to live about me. How odd it is has been to not dilute these feelings with chemicals and to suffer in cold harsh reality. My drug now is as it was before all of this. It is you. Although the only high I have is to come to this place and define the alternate universe Ive made for us to co exist in. Would that I had learned back then that I could. How much suffering would I have saved us. Something so simple as putting pen to paper , or typing on a floating keyboard of my phone. That something so benign could have saved us then. That all along you had needed to know these things inside of me that I was so terrified to show. You needed to hear them then when it would have still mattered and been able affect a positive change in our lives. I was so afraid you college trained ability would outshine what I was trying to express. Like a child trying to express the sentiment of Romeo Montague to his Sweet Juliet Capulet. I thought I'd only make myself a bigger joke. Something to be laughed at. 

I don't feel that way anymore. I understand that I am not trained as you are. But that my ability is natural and raw and real. It is hard won and by survival has it come. It has power and I have inspired heartache , love and tears from strangers the world over. I have also inspired from them prayers for our reunion. As the read the scenes of our hopless romance unfold. As I told you I don't seek to be in your shadow anymore. Not unless there is where I have to be to hold you and support you. I want to stand tall with my head held high so that you can see who I really am. I want to be in the sunlight where you can the sparkle in my azure eyes and see for yourself how your love makes me shine. The sins of my past do not disclude me from your presence. The fact that I have faced them and walked the path of this journey in fact are what make me worthy. I only wish for you to see the same for yourself. 

We were meant for this to happen to us. We were meant to survive it. Remember God does not put upon us more than we can endure. Nothing that has happened known or unknown should be reason to keep us apart. We each had our own path to walk and I do not begrudge how you got there, not what you did a long the way. We are better for having gone through this and we share what so few people in the world can express from it. We have gone to the brink of insanity. We have gone past it. We have both still longed for each other even still. Now tell me my Sweetness that is not love. The same rules do not apply to us as to others. They have not lived as we have and do not know what we know. Only we can define us and no forked tongue can possibly define us. This much I know you know. 

I challenge you. I dare you. I double dogg dare you in fact. One conversation. One embrace. The moisture shared in one kiss. If not forgo the rest and no words need be said. Let us instead speak our intentions with our bodies holy and sanctified by all that we have endured. I challenge you to this. Will you reject me and name yourself coward? Will you admit that I am stronger? You never have before. You who knows no fail. Who doesn't know how quit or give up. Who changes the world around her in order to succeed. I have watched you in amusement and in horror as you have redined reality in order to get the outcome you manifest before you. So I dare you to now. Show me a little of that magic I have seen. Believe in me  so as to manifest this unspoken thing between us into the hear and now. Are you chicken? Have you lost it? Has life just beaten you into submission? Try that trick or you want to. I know different. I know you are still in there. I hear your voice all around me calling for me still. 

You have the cords that bind us locked in a box hidden away as a book. Those cords of black , white silver and blue. The ones that wrapped around our hands in blissful union of souls entertwined. Our contract with the universe. Our acceptance that we found each other and would no longer be parted. Our magical Wonderland journey was then just starting. If only we knew then what we know now. Have you cut them? Have you retired the contract? Does the sapphire stone still glow blue. The same blue as your eyes when I first met you. Warm and mysterious and inviting. Untill you present me with my half of those cords do not fault me for believing in you. Nothing is impossible especially in Wonderland. So go about your business and slay that jabberwocky. The Mad Hatter is still waiting for you at the tea party. Yes I know you prefer Coffee. The Cheshire cat still gives you his grin languidly floating in the air. Absolom still puffs on his pipe and offers his cryptic advice. You are the real Alice and you have been here before. The white rabbit isn't real. So stop chasing him. It is just your inner self you are trying to find. You have no need to keep running. Mad Hatter accepts you as you are. Your stark raving mad he tell you but honestly all the best people are. What fun would be if you weren't? Who else could I play this life sized game of chess with but you? Stop being distracted by paper card soldiers and rocking horse flies. Eat me , Drink me, you not to small or to talk. Your just as you should be. You perfect the way that you are. When down is up and up is down which way do you go? It easy my dear sweet Alice. Close your eyes and follow your heart. I promise if you do that it will lead you back to me. Wherever you find yourself is where you are and where you are is where your meant to be. Read that again. Where ever you find yourself. The place where you find yourself is not where you hide behind masks to be sure. It is where you step from the shadows unashamed and believing in yourself again again. 

This journey was one of self discovery. It was never meant to be something to run from. We are not the sum of our mistakes. We are what we choose to do with ourselves after. You have captained your ship. You have explored the unknown. You have done what others said couldn't be done. You are a power into yourself and beautiful to behold all the while. As all sojourners come to know, as all seamen long for, what is the journey without someone to experience it in the sunset of our lives. Each day that passes is a day we can not get back. Our bodies will deflate and wither in time. Let us enjoy while can our ability to express our vigor for each other. Let us play our game of carnality where you are the prey and I am the lion. Tremble at my roar. Your body betrays you. You musk leaves for me a potent trail. I know you seek to shudder beneath me and moan my name and squeal. I know your curious to see it if it still just as powerful as it was , or will it be so much more. We are not what we were then. We have lived and learned knew games to play. Let us find in each other and eternal playground to enjoy. 

Let all this not be in vain . Let me not to have learned all these lessons for no reason that can help us. Accept the sacrifice I place upon your alter and anoint me with the moisture of your sweet lips. Sanctify me in your holy water. Let the sweat of our embrace be the anointing oil. Let us once again purify our love. I didn't learn all these things for no reason. Life didn't let me survive to only kneel at your alter. Unless that is to work my way up one inch at a time every part of your body. Unlocking your heart a long the way. Only you can decide to trust me. To believe in me once again. I can not make you but in this you really should trust it. To not do so would be grievous mistake. Hold my hand dear one. Hold my hand Sweetness. Hold my in the darkness and we shall find the light again. Hold my hand in the storm so that we don't loose each other in the tempest. Hold my hand in the sunset of lives so that we may lol back and remember how we lived. Oh how we have lived. Fairy tales can come true. We can have our happily ever after. It's time and I choose you. The raven learned a new note. Nevermore was not his only tune. Now he sings of us in truth Forevermore. Forevermore. Forevermore.

1m09n94,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersAnswered/comments/1m09n94/the_sacrifice_i_place_on_your_alter/,The sacrifice I place on your alter,"I don't know what to do anymore. I've played this game so long I don't know how to live anymore. I'm so lonely I don't even feel human. No one should live this long without feeling the loving embrace of another. Now it's been so long that the thought scares me to try. What do I do with that? 

I want this choice to mean something to you. I want to pour this 3yrs of longing into you. I want it to be this magical elixir that heals things between us. I really feel like it could if you'd let it. I want it to be be a sacrifice I lay upon your alter. Something you choose to sanctify and anoint me with moisture of your kiss. The gentle warmth of your embrace. The blooming heat that will grow like a fanned fire between us. Burning away our pains in its purifying testimony. Is so wrong to seek to worship and rejoice with you so? 

I realize now this wasn't just the sacrifice of my body to atone for my sins. This was an outright refusal to live without you. To disallow myself joy and to disavow human connection. Something you know as a person I need in order to function. If I were to choose to live again then by chance I become embroiled in life. I would be faced with choices where I have to admit you are not there and do not care at all what I do. By playing the game and believing in this fantasy I have been able to keep you first in my heart. 

In doing so I have changed integrally deep down to my bones and I like this new me. I like the depth I find   The clarity with which I see. The ability to know and understand you so well. Is this the real reward I glean from my chosen celibacy? Is it not supposed to be you? Would I loose it the second I embrace another? Your anointing and it's chance at beautiful reunion ripped from the pages already written in the magic scrolls of the universe. 

What do I do? Do I choose to live and put myself upon a new path that takes me further away from you? Do I remain to disallow and disavow these things I find myself yearning for more and more now. In doing so I some regards I remain unworthy. My life remains unstable. I remain disfunctional. But can my love for you truly be tested untill I am met with a choice in which I choose you first over another? When doing that would be to intentionally harm someone willing to love me for who I am. Surely that can't be the answer. My karmic debt is to high as it is. 
Would it not rip me apart as it did you? 

So I don't know what to do. I don't want to let go of the belief in my heart. What I know is the truth of all this and if you. Logic says one thing and the heart says another. I know when it comes to love logic does does not rule. Love is blind and it chooses as it will. It doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't have to be pretty. It's isn't always rainbows and sunshine. When it comes to loving someone being willing to suffer their storm is every bit as beautiful as some hopeless romantic fools desperate antics to get their attention. 

How do I express to you the beauty I have found in the storm? How can I get through to you how much more I love you for having gone through the storm for you? The story of us could be written and found within pages of any romance novel. Keeping men and women on the edge of their seat and begging for our long awaited reunion. So easily the truth that we have lived would inspire tears to flow and in their collective make wonderus rivers. Both Serene and mighty. The passion in our love making make women wet and men stiff and uncomfortable. All this and more is the truth we have lived thus far. So how do I just say enough and lay down my sword? How do I quit and simply move on? How do I hold another and not feel so empty compared to how I felt with you? Tell me Sweetness, My Empress Magnificent, what is it that should do? 

Therein lies another problem. How do I believe you when you do. Our history is riddled with examples of you saying one thing sincere and you could but in your heart you wanted to say something vastly different. You would say something and hope that I didn't listen. Hope that I saw through you guise and did something that would make your heart sing. Now that I can do just that the ability is wasted . Like some cruel joke played on us by life just to mock us. 

All I know is that with every day that goes by I only love you more. The desire and temptation grows and grows to the point it feels like it could be bottled and sold. You make me sweat with fever from dreams. Those same dreams becomes frightful and I wake up in cold sweats. Sometimes though , oh the sometimes when they are so sweet and I wake rock hard and so wanting. How do I accept any other in your place. When all I want is you? 

I need your comfort. I need your embrace. I need the closeness of you near to me. I need answers to so many questions about what we are to each other. About what we once were. I need confirmation and I strive for acceptance. I know now the work has been geuines and I know I am worthy. Would you though be kind and bestow on me your grace or would you be cruel and push me away while silently feeling something so much different? 

You put up the boundary and I honor it still. So I come to this place and perform my heart's ambitions on stage for the world to see and to swoon. These words are not for them. These emotions are meant to be shared between only you and I. I have no other choice. I have to release them out of me. I have to give them definition and form and manifest them. They are not truly understood in me untill I author them in some form of prose. So I come here and I leave my mark upon the world hoping they will be a flag you will know. Hoping you see that it is not some freshman love letter but an entire universe I built for us to exist in. A place where you can see into me without having to question the truth of your feelings for me. In this I mean only for it to be a gift to and a way to heal. A way to restore things I broke inside of you. How I wish you felt the same need in you. 

I can't undo the past. I can't erase it or hide it. We went through something terrible. We did terrible things to each other. Some were instigated by others who felt the need to interject themselves into our life. Yes we failed each other and drank of their poison. I don't know why this happened. I don't why we were picked to endure this. I know what I feel in my heart.  Some people say God will put upon you more than you are able to endure. I feel a connection in that. Because I have been to the brink of insanity and maybe even past it. Yet I am still here and better for having gone through this to come out the other side. In many religions there is a belief that in order to be the shaman, the witch doctor, the druid, or holy man you have to have been scarred by life tragically and survived. I understand that now. I know what it's like to feel different from others. To feel Profound for having gone something so horrible and kept intact my core beliefs. I have stumbled in my integrity, and fallen over my morals. I have sinned and wallowed in darkness. Yet no matter the attempts of forked tongues, they promises made with malice, I have never let the darkness in to rule me. I have played on the borders. I have fallen into the abyss and from there I did things that were so unlike me. I saw the aftermath and I abhor the reality of my actions. I don't need the same from you. I know what I am and I know what I am not. I am not evil and I am a good man. I didn't have reason to believe in myself then standing in your shadow. Now though I do and your shadow is not where I choose to be. It is time for you to look and what you have made of me. What your love has inspired. 

More than that. It is time for you to let go of the burdens. To cut away the barb wire you surround yourself with. To cast off the chains and let me use this key that you gave me. It is time to come down from your tower. I have seen your signals. So you to turn your tower into a lighthouse. You need not fear in this. There is no malice. I know I have said before to believe in me. You know the truth and you know the difference. You can see the work I have done. I didn't seek to be beside you without going through the journey to get there this time. This time I chose you first everyday. I will not forget and I will not just stand there victorious. I understand now our love is a garden and it needs constant attention or the weeds will overgrow all the good intentions. In truth of this before I was more than guilty. Let me show you I have learned my lesson. 

I have accepted the accountability for my actions. I have faced the mirror and saw the ugly reflection. I have admitted what I became and the damage I caused to those who suffered to love me. I have worn my shame and as I do my heart. My their on my sleeve. For all to see. I may have sought to run once upon a time. I may have sought the easy way out to escape. In my head I thought what a romantic end to a tragic to story. To die for someone you love. I know now I was only wanting to hurt you and to run from something I was ashamed of. 

Let me tell you the irony of life. Just the other day I found out someone I knew had killed themself. I don't know the full story. I do know that he had reason to be ashamed. Something he did sent him to court just days after his child arrived in this world. I didn't know any of this and I watched his much younger wife who had list her her husband and had her child taken by DCFS. Sit there and in her loss get high into oblivion. Crying and sobbing and cursing the world. I was sober as a jay bird and disgusted with her use. Yet I myself have done the same in the past. Now though I see what his choice has done. What he left behind and how broken the world is not for just her but his child. Let me tell you it is not Romantic. Not at all. I am beyond ashamed that I thought so. That I almost did this to you so long ago. It is a horror and a terrible sentence I almost bestowed on you. I was hurt and out of my mind as I had sought to get high to cope with it. I saw no other answer and it seemed so romantic. The one thing I could do for you and get it right. 

I was wrong. I was choosing the easy way out. The path that took the least work. The one that meant I didn't have to face you or all the things I have since the day I survived. I wasn't choosing you at all. I was choosing myself over your pain. I had been all along with every excuse I made to continue my behavior. Blaming you for the distance between us. Faulting you for the choices you made. When I left you no option and in truth you meant them to be a warning. A reason to stand up and be a man. To stop retreating into my childhood truama and to meet you were you were. Someone had to be the bigger person and to stop the vicious cycle from repeating. I am sorry that method I chose burned down our life and scarred the memories of our love. I am more sorry than you will ever understand or know. Because I live in those memories as painful as they are just to be with you once more. Like watching a movie youve seen over and over and you sit there begging them not to go upstairs. That's how I sit and watch the horror of what became our life and our love. Knowing now what we didn't know then. All the places we went wrong, and all the reasons we couldn't see then. 

So life's irony. To look at the reality of my choices have done. To see what pain I would have caused you had I not survived. To be disgusted by seeing someone make the same choices I did and to sit there and get high. Even more so that I had no clue if his pain because I was so caught up in my own. How I could of shared with him a few words to inspire him not to. In truth no one knew and he did it from a jail cell. I know I and no one is at fault. Still me being me I feel some guilt cause that's just how I am. Something you used to live about me. How odd it is has been to not dilute these feelings with chemicals and to suffer in cold harsh reality. My drug now is as it was before all of this. It is you. Although the only high I have is to come to this place and define the alternate universe Ive made for us to co exist in. Would that I had learned back then that I could. How much suffering would I have saved us. Something so simple as putting pen to paper , or typing on a floating keyboard of my phone. That something so benign could have saved us then. That all along you had needed to know these things inside of me that I was so terrified to show. You needed to hear them then when it would have still mattered and been able affect a positive change in our lives. I was so afraid you college trained ability would outshine what I was trying to express. Like a child trying to express the sentiment of Romeo Montague to his Sweet Juliet Capulet. I thought I'd only make myself a bigger joke. Something to be laughed at. 

I don't feel that way anymore. I understand that I am not trained as you are. But that my ability is natural and raw and real. It is hard won and by survival has it come. It has power and I have inspired heartache , love and tears from strangers the world over. I have also inspired from them prayers for our reunion. As the read the scenes of our hopless romance unfold. As I told you I don't seek to be in your shadow anymore. Not unless there is where I have to be to hold you and support you. I want to stand tall with my head held high so that you can see who I really am. I want to be in the sunlight where you can the sparkle in my azure eyes and see for yourself how your love makes me shine. The sins of my past do not disclude me from your presence. The fact that I have faced them and walked the path of this journey in fact are what make me worthy. I only wish for you to see the same for yourself. 

We were meant for this to happen to us. We were meant to survive it. Remember God does not put upon us more than we can endure. Nothing that has happened known or unknown should be reason to keep us apart. We each had our own path to walk and I do not begrudge how you got there, not what you did a long the way. We are better for having gone through this and we share what so few people in the world can express from it. We have gone to the brink of insanity. We have gone past it. We have both still longed for each other even still. Now tell me my Sweetness that is not love. The same rules do not apply to us as to others. They have not lived as we have and do not know what we know. Only we can define us and no forked tongue can possibly define us. This much I know you know. 

I challenge you. I dare you. I double dogg dare you in fact. One conversation. One embrace. The moisture shared in one kiss. If not forgo the rest and no words need be said. Let us instead speak our intentions with our bodies holy and sanctified by all that we have endured. I challenge you to this. Will you reject me and name yourself coward? Will you admit that I am stronger? You never have before. You who knows no fail. Who doesn't know how quit or give up. Who changes the world around her in order to succeed. I have watched you in amusement and in horror as you have redined reality in order to get the outcome you manifest before you. So I dare you to now. Show me a little of that magic I have seen. Believe in me  so as to manifest this unspoken thing between us into the hear and now. Are you chicken? Have you lost it? Has life just beaten you into submission? Try that trick or you want to. I know different. I know you are still in there. I hear your voice all around me calling for me still. 

You have the cords that bind us locked in a box hidden away as a book. Those cords of black , white silver and blue. The ones that wrapped around our hands in blissful union of souls entertwined. Our contract with the universe. Our acceptance that we found each other and would no longer be parted. Our magical Wonderland journey was then just starting. If only we knew then what we know now. Have you cut them? Have you retired the contract? Does the sapphire stone still glow blue. The same blue as your eyes when I first met you. Warm and mysterious and inviting. Untill you present me with my half of those cords do not fault me for believing in you. Nothing is impossible especially in Wonderland. So go about your business and slay that jabberwocky. The Mad Hatter is still waiting for you at the tea party. Yes I know you prefer Coffee. The Cheshire cat still gives you his grin languidly floating in the air. Absolom still puffs on his pipe and offers his cryptic advice. You are the real Alice and you have been here before. The white rabbit isn't real. So stop chasing him. It is just your inner self you are trying to find. You have no need to keep running. Mad Hatter accepts you as you are. Your stark raving mad he tell you but honestly all the best people are. What fun would be if you weren't? Who else could I play this life sized game of chess with but you? Stop being distracted by paper card soldiers and rocking horse flies. Eat me , Drink me, you not to small or to talk. Your just as you should be. You perfect the way that you are. When down is up and up is down which way do you go? It easy my dear sweet Alice. Close your eyes and follow your heart. I promise if you do that it will lead you back to me. Wherever you find yourself is where you are and where you are is where your meant to be. Read that again. Where ever you find yourself. The place where you find yourself is not where you hide behind masks to be sure. It is where you step from the shadows unashamed and believing in yourself again again. 

This journey was one of self discovery. It was never meant to be something to run from. We are not the sum of our mistakes. We are what we choose to do with ourselves after. You have captained your ship. You have explored the unknown. You have done what others said couldn't be done. You are a power into yourself and beautiful to behold all the while. As all sojourners come to know, as all seamen long for, what is the journey without someone to experience it in the sunset of our lives. Each day that passes is a day we can not get back. Our bodies will deflate and wither in time. Let us enjoy while can our ability to express our vigor for each other. Let us play our game of carnality where you are the prey and I am the lion. Tremble at my roar. Your body betrays you. You musk leaves for me a potent trail. I know you seek to shudder beneath me and moan my name and squeal. I know your curious to see it if it still just as powerful as it was , or will it be so much more. We are not what we were then. We have lived and learned knew games to play. Let us find in each other and eternal playground to enjoy. 

Let all this not be in vain . Let me not to have learned all these lessons for no reason that can help us. Accept the sacrifice I place upon your alter and anoint me with the moisture of your sweet lips. Sanctify me in your holy water. Let the sweat of our embrace be the anointing oil. Let us once again purify our love. I didn't learn all these things for no reason. Life didn't let me survive to only kneel at your alter. Unless that is to work my way up one inch at a time every part of your body. Unlocking your heart a long the way. Only you can decide to trust me. To believe in me once again. I can not make you but in this you really should trust it. To not do so would be grievous mistake. Hold my hand dear one. Hold my hand Sweetness. Hold my in the darkness and we shall find the light again. Hold my hand in the storm so that we don't loose each other in the tempest. Hold my hand in the sunset of lives so that we may lol back and remember how we lived. Oh how we have lived. Fairy tales can come true. We can have our happily ever after. It's time and I choose you. The raven learned a new note. Nevermore was not his only tune. Now he sings of us in truth Forevermore. Forevermore. Forevermore.

1m09m6z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m09m6z,Ballard (2025) *1 Season,"""Ballard"" doesn’t waste time pretending the LAPD is squeaky clean—it dives headfirst into the mess, shotgun in hand, with Maggie Q’s Renée Ballard leading the charge from a literal basement. The cold case squad she inherits is a patchwork of volunteers, retirees, and one intern who looks like she’s surviving on caffeine and trauma. The vibe? Think CSI meets The Breakfast Club, but everyone’s got baggage and a badge. The show kicks off with a John Doe and a missing baby, then spirals into a web of corruption, serial killers, and political pressure that feels way too real. Ballard’s not just solving crimes—she’s dodging sabotage from inside the system.

The cast is stacked with quiet MVPs. John Carroll Lynch brings retired cop Thomas Laffont to life with the kind of weary wisdom that makes you want him to adopt you. Courtney Taylor’s Samira Parker is all grit and guarded vulnerability, and their dynamic with ""Ballard"" is electric without ever being forced. Maggie Q absolutely owns the role—she’s sharp, emotionally layered, and never lets the show slip into melodrama. The pacing is tight, the cases are compelling, and the writing gives just enough space for personal moments to breathe. Plus, the cameos from the Bosch universe are sprinkled in like seasoning—not overpowering, just enough to make longtime fans nod in approval.

But not everything hits. Some of the emotional beats feel rushed, especially when the show tries to juggle too many cases at once. There’s a subplot involving a fraternity death that feels like it wandered in from another series, and a few characters (looking at you, Ted Rawls) lean too hard into quirky sidekick territory. The show also dips into familiar procedural tropes—corrupt cops, political cover-ups, the “I did it to protect you” confession—but it mostly manages to twist them into something fresh. ""Ballard"" doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it sharpens it. If you’ve ever felt like justice is a slow grind through red tape and bad coffee, this show gets it—and it’s not afraid to punch through the wall to find the truth————————————————————————

I saw no other answer and it seemed so romantic. The one thing I could do for you and get it right. 

I was wrong. I was choosing the easy way out. The path that took the least work. The one that meant I didn't have to face you or all the things I have since the day I survived. I wasn't choosing you at all. I was choosing myself over your pain. I had been all along with every excuse I made to continue my behavior. Blaming you for the distance between us. Faulting you for the choices you made. When I left you no option and in truth you meant them to be a warning. A reason to stand up and be a man. To stop retreating into my childhood truama and to meet you were you were. Someone had to be the bigger person and to stop the vicious cycle from repeating. I am sorry that method I chose burned down our life and scarred the memories of our love. I am more sorry than you will ever understand or know. Because I live in those memories as painful as they are just to be with you once more. Like watching a movie youve seen over and over and you sit there begging them not to go upstairs. That's how I sit and watch the horror of what became our life and our love. Knowing now what we didn't know then. All the places we went wrong, and all the reasons we couldn't see then. 

So life's irony. To look at the reality of my choices have done. To see what pain I would have caused you had I not survived. To be disgusted by seeing someone make the same choices I did and to sit there and get high. Even more so that I had no clue if his pain because I was so caught up in my own. How I could of shared with him a few words to inspire him not to. In truth no one knew and he did it from a jail cell. I know I and no one is at fault. Still me being me I feel some guilt cause that's just how I am. Something you used to live about me. How odd it is has been to not dilute these feelings with chemicals and to suffer in cold harsh reality. My drug now is as it was before all of this. It is you. Although the only high I have is to come to this place and define the alternate universe Ive made for us to co exist in. Would that I had learned back then that I could. How much suffering would I have saved us. Something so simple as putting pen to paper , or typing on a floating keyboard of my phone. That something so benign could have saved us then. That all along you had needed to know these things inside of me that I was so terrified to show. You needed to hear them then when it would have still mattered and been able affect a positive change in our lives. I was so afraid you college trained ability would outshine what I was trying to express. Like a child trying to express the sentiment of Romeo Montague to his Sweet Juliet Capulet. I thought I'd only make myself a bigger joke. Something to be laughed at. 

I don't feel that way anymore. I understand that I am not trained as you are. But that my ability is natural and raw and real. It is hard won and by survival has it come. It has power and I have inspired heartache , love and tears from strangers the world over. I have also inspired from them prayers for our reunion. As the read the scenes of our hopless romance unfold. As I told you I don't seek to be in your shadow anymore. Not unless there is where I have to be to hold you and support you. I want to stand tall with my head held high so that you can see who I really am. I want to be in the sunlight where you can the sparkle in my azure eyes and see for yourself how your love makes me shine. The sins of my past do not disclude me from your presence. The fact that I have faced them and walked the path of this journey in fact are what make me worthy. I only wish for you to see the same for yourself. 

We were meant for this to happen to us. We were meant to survive it. Remember God does not put upon us more than we can endure. Nothing that has happened known or unknown should be reason to keep us apart. We each had our own path to walk and I do not begrudge how you got there, not what you did a long the way. We are better for having gone through this and we share what so few people in the world can express from it. We have gone to the brink of insanity. We have gone past it. We have both still longed for each other even still. Now tell me my Sweetness that is not love. The same rules do not apply to us as to others. They have not lived as we have and do not know what we know. Only we can define us and no forked tongue can possibly define us. This much I know you know. 

I challenge you. I dare you. I double dogg dare you in fact. One conversation. One embrace. The moisture shared in one kiss. If not forgo the rest and no words need be said. Let us instead speak our intentions with our bodies holy and sanctified by all that we have endured. I challenge you to this. Will you reject me and name yourself coward? Will you admit that I am stronger? You never have before. You who knows no fail. Who doesn't know how quit or give up. Who changes the world around her in order to succeed. I have watched you in amusement and in horror as you have redined reality in order to get the outcome you manifest before you. So I dare you to now. Show me a little of that magic I have seen. Believe in me  so as to manifest this unspoken thing between us into the hear and now. Are you chicken? Have you lost it? Has life just beaten you into submission? Try that trick or you want to. I know different. I know you are still in there. I hear your voice all around me calling for me still. 

You have the cords that bind us locked in a box hidden away as a book. Those cords of black , white silver and blue. The ones that wrapped around our hands in blissful union of souls entertwined. Our contract with the universe. Our acceptance that we found each other and would no longer be parted. Our magical Wonderland journey was then just starting. If only we knew then what we know now. Have you cut them? Have you retired the contract? Does the sapphire stone still glow blue. The same blue as your eyes when I first met you. Warm and mysterious and inviting. Untill you present me with my half of those cords do not fault me for believing in you. Nothing is impossible especially in Wonderland. So go about your business and slay that jabberwocky. The Mad Hatter is still waiting for you at the tea party. Yes I know you prefer Coffee. The Cheshire cat still gives you his grin languidly floating in the air. Absolom still puffs on his pipe and offers his cryptic advice. You are the real Alice and you have been here before. The white rabbit isn't real. So stop chasing him. It is just your inner self you are trying to find. You have no need to keep running. Mad Hatter accepts you as you are. Your stark raving mad he tell you but honestly all the best people are. What fun would be if you weren't? Who else could I play this life sized game of chess with but you? Stop being distracted by paper card soldiers and rocking horse flies. Eat me , Drink me, you not to small or to talk. Your just as you should be. You perfect the way that you are. When down is up and up is down which way do you go? It easy my dear sweet Alice. Close your eyes and follow your heart. I promise if you do that it will lead you back to me. Wherever you find yourself is where you are and where you are is where your meant to be. Read that again. Where ever you find yourself. The place where you find yourself is not where you hide behind masks to be sure. It is where you step from the shadows unashamed and believing in yourself again again. 

This journey was one of self discovery. It was never meant to be something to run from. We are not the sum of our mistakes. We are what we choose to do with ourselves after. You have captained your ship. You have explored the unknown. You have done what others said couldn't be done. You are a power into yourself and beautiful to behold all the while. As all sojourners come to know, as all seamen long for, what is the journey without someone to experience it in the sunset of our lives. Each day that passes is a day we can not get back. Our bodies will deflate and wither in time. Let us enjoy while can our ability to express our vigor for each other. Let us play our game of carnality where you are the prey and I am the lion. Tremble at my roar. Your body betrays you. You musk leaves for me a potent trail. I know you seek to shudder beneath me and moan my name and squeal. I know your curious to see it if it still just as powerful as it was , or will it be so much more. We are not what we were then. We have lived and learned knew games to play. Let us find in each other and eternal playground to enjoy. 

Let all this not be in vain . Let me not to have learned all these lessons for no reason that can help us. Accept the sacrifice I place upon your alter and anoint me with the moisture of your sweet lips. Sanctify me in your holy water. Let the sweat of our embrace be the anointing oil. Let us once again purify our love. I didn't learn all these things for no reason. Life didn't let me survive to only kneel at your alter. Unless that is to work my way up one inch at a time every part of your body. Unlocking your heart a long the way. Only you can decide to trust me. To believe in me once again. I can not make you but in this you really should trust it. To not do so would be grievous mistake. Hold my hand dear one. Hold my hand Sweetness. Hold my in the darkness and we shall find the light again. Hold my hand in the storm so that we don't loose each other in the tempest. Hold my hand in the sunset of lives so that we may lol back and remember how we lived. Oh how we have lived. Fairy tales can come true. We can have our happily ever after. It's time and I choose you. The raven learned a new note. Nevermore was not his only tune. Now he sings of us in truth Forevermore. Forevermore. Forevermore.

Just been adding truvia to my stuff. But it doesn’t taste the same. So, today I decided to test out my regular coffee, two teaspoons of sugar, unsweetened almond milk, and a splash of heavy cream. To boot, I drank this around four hours after I last ate, so I wasn’t pairing this with any protein or anything. 

Drank my drink, was happy but slowly dreading to check after two hours because for all intents and purposes, this should spike me. Checked and my blood sugar was actually lower than it was two hours prior! I was stunned. I’m not sure if it makes a difference that I did a weight workout before drinking this. 

The thing is, isn’t pure added sugar like that bad for us? I’m not sure why I didn’t spike and I’m wondering if somehow it’s a false result? ",2,1752557701.0,diabetes_t2,2,1.0,False
1m09ko8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1m09ko8/unexplained_weight_loss_and_fatigue/,Unexplained weight loss and fatigue,"This is a long post.

I've lost weight unintentionally during the past two and a half years. My energy levels have also severly dropped, and it's starting to affect my entire wellbeing.

I moved to a new city in late 2022, started grad school and got a new job. My life was very busy and intense. I started eating substantially less and was more physically active than I've ever been. My weight was 50 kg in late 2022. My Height is 5′1′′.

Someday in June 2023, I'd just returned home from work and was undressing to take a shower when I saw myself in the mirror and noticed how my collarbones, ribcage bones and pelvic bones were all sticking out. This was really frightening as I'd never seen myself like that before. My collarbones have never been pronounced, neither did my ribcage or pelvic bones.

I saw a doctor a few days later, she told me I needed to eat more and to eat healthier. She gave me ideas of what to eat for a 'balanced' diet. At that point, I've been having one (small) meal a day with snacks and coffee throughout. The meal was either an actual meal, a salad or a Subway sandwich. It depended on the day.

I did exactly like she said, started cooking healthier balanced meals and increased my food intake significantly more than before. I genuinely thought I was doing OK, even though my weight hadn't been visibly increasing. But the next time I'd weighed myself was in December 2023, and I was 42 kg. The doctor ordered me to get a blood test, a urine test, an X-ray and a heart ECG. The tests didn't show any problems, which was very confusing.

Since I was a teenager untill that point, I'd been diagnosed with several mental health conditions and had been taking psychiatric medications that could cause a decrease in appetite. But I'm sure this is not an appetite problem. I also discussed this with the doctor.

I continued on the same diet for the following few month till May 2024 with no big improvement. In May 2024, I decided to just start eating high-fat foods. Almost everything I ate was deep fried. I ate lots of takeout, lots of sweets and pastries. By July 2024, my weight had increased to 45 kg. But it didn't help with my low energy levels. I was constantly feeling exhausted, and was becoming less and less productive.

I went back to eating on the recommended diet. Now (1 year later), my weight is 43 kg. I still look very unhealthy. I feel tired almost all the time and it's really difficult for me to stay productive.

I'm starting to worry this might follow me for longer than it should.

The Podgorica City Stadium, a fortress of Montenegrin pride, now hosts a David-and-Goliath-esque clash… except both teams are Davids. Buducnost Podgorica, the local heavyweights, stagger into this second leg with a 1-0 deficit and the weight of a season on their shoulders. FC Noah, the Armenian underdogs who just completed a domestic double, arrive like a well-dressed storm, armed with a knack for scoring first and a habit of turning referees into human pinball machines. This isn’t just a Champions League qualifier—it’s a chess match played with fire, where one misstep could cost a continent-wide career.

### The Numbers: A Tale of Two Tactics

Let’s start with the obvious: FC Noah is a team that *loves* to open the scoring. In five of their last seven games, they’ve struck first, a stat that reads like a magician’s trick—*“Ladies and gentlemen, I’ll score before your coffee cools!”* Their opponents, meanwhile, seem to have signed up for a psychology lesson in futility. But here’s the rub: Buducnost isn’t just a team; they’re a survival guide. In the first leg, they weathered Noah’s storm, holding firm until a late goal shattered their hopes. Now, they’ll need to do the near-impossible: score without conceding, a task akin to juggling chainsaws while wearing a life jacket.

The betting odds? FC Noah is the clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around 52-54% (thanks to decimal odds of 1.91-1.95). Buducnost, at 3.3-3.65, implies a 28-30% chance—a statistical long shot, but not a mathematically dead one. The draw? A tidy 29-30%, which feels about right for a match where both teams have something to lose.

But here’s where the chaos kicks in: Noah’s disciplinary record. In seven of their last nine games, there’ve been *at least five bookings*. That’s not just a red-card lottery—it’s a referee’s nightmare. Imagine a game where the scoreline isn’t the only thing fluctuating. If Buducnost can milk a few yellow cards, they might just turn th

Let’s set the scene: In a corner of Europe where the population of Andorra could fit into a single stadium section, Inter Club d’Escaldes hosts FCSB in the second leg of a Champions League qualifier. The first leg saw Inter Club triumph 3-1, but not before suffering their first defeat of the season—a twist as dramatic as a soap opera finale. Meanwhile, FCSB, the Romanian giants, arrive with an unbeaten record this season and a résumé that includes reaching the third qualifying round last year. This isn’t just a football match; it’s a David-and-Goliath spectacle where David’s budget is a rounding error on Goliath’s spreadsheet.

---

### The Underdog with a Population Problem

Inter Club d’Escaldes, the Andorran champions, are the kind of team that makes you question the UEFA qualification criteria. With a population of \~77,000, Andorra’s entire GDP could buy a single transfer window for a mid-tier European club. Yet here they are, hosting a Champions League qualifier like it’s Tuesday. Their home form is *legendary*—unbeaten in competitive games since August 2024, which is impressive if you ignore the fact that their last European loss was to AEK Athens in the Conference League. Let’s just say their “defense” is about as reliable as a sieve at a soup convention.

FCSB, meanwhile, are the real deal. The Romanian champions have a 100% record in all competitions this season, a stat so clean it could pass for a spreadsheet error. Their recent 1-1 draw with Hermannstadt? A tactical masterclass disguised as a coffee break. And let’s not forget their European pedigree: last season, they made it to the third qualifying round, which in UEFA’s hierarchy is about as far as you get without a passport.

---

### The Numbers Game: When Math Meets Mayhem

Let’s unpack the odds. FCSB is the overwhelming favorite, with prices ranging from **-1.33 to -1.38** (implied probability: \~73-75%) across bookmakers. Inter Club, the underdog, sits at **+5.6 to +7.5** (11-16%), while the draw is priced at **+4.65 to +5.25** (19-21%). At first glance, this looks like a mismatch. But here’s the rub: in lower-tier European qualifiers, underdogs often defy expectations. Take the 2023 Conference League, where 32% of underdogs won outright—proof that in football, even a squirrel can score if you hand it a slingshot.

But FCSB isn’t just any favorite. Their European record is a masterclass in efficiency. Last season, they outscored opponents 5-1 in two legs against lower-tier competition, and their -1.5 spread line here isn’t just a number—it’s a declaration of intent. Mea

Hey Travel Trotters! Just got back from an amazing weekend in Tijuana and wanted to share my experience with fellow adventurers who might be hesitant about visiting this vibrant border city.

Like many of you, I'd heard mixed things about TJ's safety. But after doing my research and following some smart travel practices, I had an incredible time with zero issues. Here's my full breakdown:

## The Reality vs. The Reputation 🔍

Tijuana has definitely gotten a bad rap in media, but the tourist areas are worlds apart from the neighborhoods where problems typically occur. During my three days there, I felt completely at ease walking around Avenida Revolución and Zona Río during both day and night.

The city is ALIVE with energy - street food vendors, artisans selling handcrafted goods, and locals who were genuinely friendly and proud to share their city with visitors.

## My Foolproof Safety Strategy 🛡️

What worked brilliantly for me:

**I stayed in tourist zones** - Avenida Revolución was my home base, and I made day trips to places like Mercado Hidalgo (amazing for spices and authentic Mexican goods!) and the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT). The iconic ""tijuana"" sign near the arch is perfect for those obligatory travel selfies too!

**I used rideshare apps** instead of hailing random taxis. This was a game-changer for feeling secure while moving around the city. Drivers were professional and the cars were clean.

**I kept a money belt under my clothes** with most of my cash and cards, carrying only what I needed for each outing in my pocket. Never once felt like a target.

**I practiced the ""blend in"" approach** - no flashy jewelry, no expensive camera around my neck, and no wandering while staring at my phone. Basic street smarts go a long way!

**I limited nighttime drinking** to just a couple of beers. The temptation is real with those cheap margarita deals, but keeping a clear head was part of my strategy.

## Food That Will Blow Your Mind 🌮🔥

Guys, the FOOD. I can't even begin to describe how amazing and affordable the culinary scene is here.

Caesar salad was INVENTED in Tijuana, and having one prepared tableside at Caesar's Restaurant on Avenida Revolución was a highlight. It costs about $15 USD and the showmanship alone is worth it.

The street tacos are life-changing. My favorites were at Taquería El Franc, where I had the best carne asada and adobada tacos of my LIFE for less than $2 each. The locals packed this place, which is always a good sign.

For seafood lovers, visit the Mariscos El Mazateño for their incredible shrimp tacos ""gobernador style"" - I'm still dreaming about them.

## Cultural Experiences That Cost Almost Nothing 🎭

The Sunday Artisan Market at the Rio Zone is a treasure trove of authentic crafts at prices way below what you'd pay north of the border.

The CECUT (Tijuana Cultural Center) with its iconic spherical IMAX theater (locals call it ""the ball"") has fascinating exhibitions on regional history and contemporary art for just a few dollars entrance fee.

Avenida Revolución has been transformed in recent years with hip breweries, coffee shops, and boutiques. Plaza Fiesta is a must-visit for craft beer enthusiasts - it's like a maze of tiny brewpubs with amazing local brews.

## Accommodation Tips 🏨

I stayed at the Hyatt Place in Zona Río for about $85/night, which felt incredibly safe and was centrally located. If you're on a tighter budget, Hotel Ticuan in downtown ($50-60/night) is a great option with good security.

Honestly, I'd avoid Airbnbs unless you know the city well or have solid recommendations from friends who've stayed there before.

## Getting There and Around 🚗

The San Ysidro border crossing is super easy if you're coming from San Diego. I parked on the US side at one of the secure lots (about $15/day) and walked across. No hassle at all.

Walking back to the US can involve longer lines (I waited about 40 minutes). Pro tip: weekday mornings generally have shorter wait times than weekend afternoons.

Within Tijuana, using Uber is easy and cheap. A ride from the border to Zona Río was around $3-4 USD. Just make sure you have cell service or download the offline map of Tijuana before crossing.

## Final Thoughts & Planning Your Own Trip 🗺️

Tijuana surprised me in the best possible way. It's vibrant, affordable, and so much more than just a border town party spot. The locals I met were incredibly welcoming and proud of their city's cultural renaissance.

If you're planning your own adventure to TJ or beyond in Mexico, I used this awesome travel planning tool that helped me find great flight deals and build my itinerary: https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H

It saved me nearly $200 on my flights and the trip planner feature helped me organize everything in one place. Definitely worth checking out!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League Qualification: FC Drita vs. FC Differdange 03 – A David-and-Goliath Tale, Minus the Giant**

**Contextualizing the Clash: Two Small Nations, One Giant Stakes**  
Imagine a chess match played on a board the size of Luxembourg (population: 650,000, for context) with pieces carved from Kosovo’s famed coffee beans. That’s the vibe of this UEFA Champions League qualifier. FC Differdange 03, hailing from Luxembourg, and FC Drita, representing Kosovo, are two underdogs in a competition dominated by European giants. But here they are, squaring off in a second-leg do-or-die battle after Differdange’s 1-0 first-leg win.

Differdange, the “Giant” of Luxembourg, is a team so small, their stadium probably doubles as a community center for cheese-tasting events. Meanwhile, Drita, from Kosovo, carries the weight of a nation that’s still figuring out how to pronounce “UEFA Champions League” without Googling it. The first leg was a nail-biter: Differdange’s lone goal came via a deflection that ricocheted off a water bottle, a moment so serendipitous it could’ve been scripted by a Netflix docuseries about Luxembourgish football.

**Key Data Points: Stats That Make You Question the Odds**  
Let’s cut to the chase: the numbers here are as murky as Luxembourg’s tax laws. Differdange’s 2.41 implied probability (per LowVig.ag) suggests they’re the favorite, but their “victory” in the first leg was less of a triumph and more of a “we didn’t lose.” Their defense? Leakier than a sieve at a champagne factory. Drita, on the other hand, has a 36% implied chance (at 2.77) but needs to score twice in 90 minutes. Historically, underdogs in these qualifiers win \~35% of the time—so Drita’s odds are almost *too* fair.

Recent trends? Differdange’s last five matches include a 0-0 draw with a team that fielded three goalkeepers by mistake. Drita’s attack, meanwhile, has averaged 1.2 goals per game this season—about as reliable as a toaster in a thunderstorm. But here’s the kicker: Drita’s home crowd in Prishtina is so loud, it’s rumored to have caused a nearby mountain to shed a tear. Home advantage? It’s not just about passion—it’s about psychological warfare.

**Odds & Strategy: Calculating the Chaos**  
Let’s get mathy. The implied probabilities for Drita (36%) and Differdange (41.5%) add up to 77.5%, meaning the market’s vigorish (the bookies’ profit margin) is a hefty 22.5%. That’s like payi

After some experimentation and research, I've found the answer isn't as simple as a yes or no.

First, let's clarify what we mean by ""regular"" ground coffee. Usually, this refers to coffee ground for drip coffee makers. The grind size is typically medium, which is coarser than what's ideal for espresso.

Espresso machines work best with finely ground coffee. The fine grind allows for proper extraction under high pressure, giving you that rich, creamy espresso we all love. Using regular ground coffee in an espresso machine can lead to under-extraction, resulting in weak, watery espresso.

However, if you're in a pinch, you can use regular ground coffee in your espresso machine. The result won't be perfect, but it might satisfy your caffeine craving. Keep in mind that you might need to adjust your machine's settings or tamping pressure to get a decent shot.

For the best results, I always recommend using freshly ground coffee specifically for espresso. If you're looking to up your espresso game, check out this selection of top-notch espresso machines: https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines

Now, let's talk about why the right grind matters so much for espresso:

1. Extraction: Fine grounds allow for better extraction of flavors and oils.
2. Pressure: The right grind helps build proper pressure in the machine.
3. Crema: That golden layer on top of your espresso? It comes from properly ground coffee.

If you're serious about espresso, investing in a good grinder is just as important as having a quality machine. Many espresso enthusiasts prefer burr grinders for their consistency.

Remember, the type of roast matters too. Espresso blends are often darker roasts, which bring out the intense flavors we associate with espresso. However, you can experiment with different roasts to find what you like best.

For those new to the world of espresso, there's a bit of a learning curve. Don't get discouraged if your first attempts aren't perfect. It takes practice to dial in the right grind, dose, and extraction time.

If you're ready to dive into the world of home espresso, take a look at these machines: https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They range from beginner-friendly to professional-grade, so you're sure to find one that fits your needs.

In conclusion, while you can use regular ground coffee in an espresso machine in a pinch, it's not ideal. For the best espresso experience, use freshly ground coffee specifically for espresso. With the right tools and a bit of practice, you'll be pulling perfect shots in no time.",1,1752556791.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

So, this guy approached me while I was out running errands in a respectful way and we talked briefly and exchanged contact info. We met last week of June and have been talking ever since then as of today.

We ended up hanging out a few days and the vibe was vibing I felt a connection and I can say the same for him. Anyways, I’m good at reading people however, we are grown to say the least we ended up doing the do, dayssss later ( which I wasn’t bothered by). We met for a coffee date / hike but we didn’t officially have a real date yet. Which could be a red flag in a few different ways.

I felt dumb afterwards because I was celibate for 7 months and temptation came into play🙃

I feel like when we meet people we know our intentions. I kind of looked past his intentions because I’m just a girl nah but he said something recently that rubbed me the wrong way. He asked me when my cycle was coming, and I told him in a few days I asked him why did you ask me that, he said just curious. My thought was hmm I took it as a red flag.

However, it comes around that time for me ( monthly ) and he asks if he could come over to hang out or whatever, I let him know that we wouldn’t be doing anything because it’s that time he didn’t end up coming over which is fine idc.

But what made it even stranger is he told me he doesn’t like to hang out with women when they are on their periods because of our emotions and his past experiences were negative. Sounds like BS. What the heck does that have to do with me ? I’m thinking in my head. Btw this is through us texting. I told him I’ve never heard of that before and he asked “wdym” I told him past situations the guys did not care at all… I asked him are you looking at it in the sense of not getting 🐱🐱 bc that makes sense of why he wouldn’t want to hang out he told me, “ no I’m not looking at it that way.”

It kind of gave me the ick because what do you mean, I couldn’t relate because no guy has EVER told me that. I like him but now I feel like I have to cut him off because he’s just in it for the 🐱🐱 which is cool but that’s not what I’m looking for…

*July 15, 2025 – Europa Sports Complex, Gibraltar*

---

### Context: When Gibraltar’s Fortress Meets the Faroe Islands’ Fury

Imagine two teams from places so small, their national teams could fit into a single minibus. Lincoln Red Imps FC, Gibraltar’s sole professional club, and Vikingur Gota of the Faroe Islands are about to collide in a UEFA Champions League qualifier that feels like a David vs. Goliath duel… if both Davids were named “Dave” and had a mutual dislike for math.

The Red Imps, fresh off an eight-game winning streak (including six clean sheets), are the underdogs who’ve defied logic since they first qualified for Europe’s elite club competition in 2019. Their first-leg 3-2 victory over Vikingur was a rollercoaster: five goals in the first half, a defensive collapse in the second, and a celebration that probably involved a lot of Gibraltarian flag-waving. Vikingur, meanwhile, have stumbled in their last two matches, conceding four goals, which is about as many as their entire population of Goteborg (if we’re being hyperbolic).

This isn’t just a football match—it’s a geopolitical flex. Gibraltar’s team plays in a stadium that holds 1,500 fans (population of the entire territory: \~35,000) while Vikingur’s home ground in Tórshavn is a cozy 2,000-capacity arena. Both teams are essentially playing for bragging rights in regions where “local gossip” includes debates about the best way to eat a pot of tea.

---

### Key Data: A Numbers Game for the Ages

Let’s start with the obvious: **Lincoln Red Imps’ defense is a Swiss watch**. Six clean sheets in eight games? That’s the kind of consistency that makes goalkeepers feel like they’re on vacation. Conversely, Vikingur’s defense has been a sieve. Four goals in two matches? If their backline were a person, it’d be the friend who always forgets your birthday *and* spills coffee on your shirt.

But here’s the twist: **both teams love to attack**. The first leg was a 3-2 thriller, with all five goals scored in the first half. That’s the kind of chaos that makes you wonder if the players are secretly paid in adrenaline. Statistically, Lincoln’s offense is a 21st-century machine, averaging 2.5 goals per game. Vikingur? They’re more of a “hope for the best” operation, averaging 1.3 goals per match.

Recent trends? The Red Imps have won their last three European home games by a combined score of 10-1. Vikingur, meanwhile, has lost their last two qualifiers by a combined margin of 8-2. If this were a movie, Vikingur’s manager would be the one muttering, “I need a drink,” while the Red Imps’ coach sips a celebratory gin and tonic made from the proceeds of their betting pool.

1m094ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/puer/comments/1m094ir/what_are_the_health_benefits_of_drinking_tea_some/,What are the health benefits of drinking tea (some thoughts as ex-chemist),"I wanted to make a quick journal entry and share my insights on the benefits of tea drinking & some ways to rationalize the current scientific literature related to tea. My objective is to find out what are the real benefits of drinking tea and if it can have a positive impact on my daily life.

I previously worked as a chemist researching Arsenic trioxide as a treatment for a rare type of cancer called acute promyelocytic leukemia. Funnily enough this drug was discovered from Chinese medicine, isolated, passed human trials then turned into an FDA approved commercial drug “Trisenox” that costs $13,634 USD per vial. The take home I had from that experience is that there is indeed a wealth of beneficial or medicinal compounds in Chinese medicine (and possibly tea), but the process of isolation, human testing and scientific proof is long and expensive.

Moving onto Tea – I was initially surprised at the lack of understanding we have. Even for topics such as Theabrownins, many of the studies were done on rat models and we simply don’t have large randomized human trials to produce FDA approved drugs. There are also additional complexity because tea contains more than 291 voilatile organic compounds and 83 odor-active compounds. This means it’s very easy for a paper to look at a single compound (or group of compounds) and say “it’s good for you because it helps fat digestion”, and another paper to look at another compound and make the opposite argument that “it’s carcinogenic”. In many ways this is why non-scientific articles and videos have many ways of phrasing why tea is good for you and many different angles to approach the topic. You can reference [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996921007997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996921007997) and they break down the different components of tea and studies done on each component. Looking at the table, it’s obvious that we’re a good 10-20 years away from a scientifically good understanding of the topic. In other words,  it won’t be a case of Arsenic Trioxide – where we can isolate an individual compound that can treat an illnesses that can pass FDA approval.

 

We shouldn’t disregard tea – there are already a huge number of studies done on the topic and it’s clear from animal studies that tea can make a huge positive impact on our bodies.

What I think is very interesting is Tea’s impact on our Gut Microbiome (GM). In recent years, the Gut Microbiome become a hot topic as it’s linked human health, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system regulation, and even mental health. What’s interesting is that Tea has both a direct and indirect effect on our GM. It’s important to point out that studies on this are even harder than my work as a chemist – the microbiome constantly evolves over time and has many groups of species that work with (or against) each other. [https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/17/4020](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/17/4020) is a good paper that highlights where we are at. The overall the consensus seems to be that Tea’s indirect effect on the Gut is measurable and positive. I’m particularly interested on it’s long-term effects in relation to neurodegenerative diseases and obesity.

 Neurodegenerative diseases are a major concern for me personally. I feel as I’m getting older, my brain just doesn’t perform as well and it’s easier for me to be depressed. It’s something I really want to work on and if tea can make a positive impact on my mental health – then it’s worth the price of admission. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25657295](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25657295)

Meta-analyses show higher tea intake associated with lower depression and the slow down of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, both these diseases don’t have a silver bullet cure, and maybe we’re 10-15 years for isolating the drugs to fix this. But if we see positive impacts now, then starting a tea habit is a great start.

 

Something I also want to note here is that every person is different – we can respond very differently to tea or coffee drinking. The great news is that if we start developing awareness early, we can be ahead of game. As crude as it sounds, I’ve been noticing I have less constipation after drinking tea so that’s a good start.

Does it affect your pours? And if so how do you deal with it. 

I'm re-entering the workforce back to being a barista for the first time since I got sick 5 years ago. 

When I try to pour rossetas or any fancy patterns my hands shake terribly and my art goes wrong. I can pour hearts fine. 

I really like pouring rossetas etc and I worry that an employer will have the expectation of pouring more intricate designs than a heart... 

Any tips? ",1,1752556086.0,Lithium,2,1.0,False

I came here via bus and knew better to not take the cabs - they overcharge and take you to the most overcrowded places here.

Instead I walked to this place called willy’s coffee pub, I really recommend trying the cherry coke float and getting a nice book to read since they have shelves of books to choose from, they also make everything from scratch so fries and samosa are fresh and tasty.

Then I walked to rose garden (I used a shortcut to get up there instead of walking up the road)

I then took an auto to stump fields (Airbnb). The way to this place is steep and difficult but once you get there the view and vibe is fantastic)

Lastly, I enjoyed the rest of the weekend chilling in stump fields and going to the tea park close by.",60,1752555936.0,SoloTravel_India,6,1.0,False

The air in the Metropolitan Correctional Center’s security room crackled with a stale, metallic tang. Dr. Aris Thorne, his face grim, hunched over a monitor, the faint scent of antiseptic clinging to his clothes from his hastily treated shoulder wound. He’d pulled strings, called in favors, leveraged every last shred of his former DARPA authority to get access to the footage from Epstein’s cell block. What he found was worse than he’d imagined. The timestamp read 00:00:00, then abruptly jumped to 00:01:00. A single, critical minute, wiped clean. The metadata, a ghost in the machine, whispered of “MJCOLE\~1” and Adobe Premiere, a crude digital cover-up on a cosmic scale.

He found Elena Voss in a Brooklyn safehouse, a cramped apartment filled with blinking servers and the scent of stale coffee. Her eyes, usually sharp, were bloodshot from days of relentless hacking. She pulled up a feed on a cracked tablet: grainy, night-vision footage. A Discord Flame Keeper, cloaked and masked, slipped into Epstein’s cell. A corrupted shard, dark and jagged, pulsed in the Keeper’s hand. The Keeper pressed it against Epstein’s temple. A silent, agonizing spasm. Then stillness. The Keeper vanished as quickly as they appeared.

“They silenced him,” Voss whispered, her voice raw. “Not just to shut him up about the elites. He knew too much about the lab, about the Nexus Shard itself.” She showed Thorne more data, a torrent of encrypted logs. “The shard drove Epstein’s independent actions, his blackmail, his network. It manipulated these elites, not just for power, but to sow chaos. Look at the Middle East tensions in 2019, the sudden shifts in trade policy. All amplified, all orchestrated by the shard through him.” Her fingers flew across the keyboard. “And the government figures? DOJ, DARPA leadership? They’re either under its direct influence or so deeply compromised protecting the lab’s existence, they’re unwitting puppets.”

Voss’s screen flickered, showing the Quantum Veil’s signature. “DARPA’s own tech, developed from *their* experiments with the Nexus Shard, was used to erase the footage. It’s protecting itself.” She began uploading the raw, untampered footage to her covert Silent Sparrows network, a desperate act of defiance.

Just as the progress bar hit 70%, the safehouse door exploded inward. Discord Flame Catalysts, their faces hidden by distorted masks, stormed the apartment. They were fast, brutal, moving with a frenzied, almost inhuman energy. They ignored Thorne, their focus solely on Voss and her data. “The shard’s data! Give us the data!” one screamed, his voice distorted by a modulator. They weren't just here to silence her; they wanted to control the flow of information, to consolidate the shard's influence.

Thorne, despite his wound, grabbed a heavy chair, swinging it wildly, buying Voss precious seconds. “Finish it!” he roared. But the Catalysts were too many, too quick. One slammed into Voss, sending her comm-pad skittering across the floor. Another grabbed her, dragging her towards the shattered doorway.

Just then, the wail of sirens pierced the night. Agent Lena Petrova, her face grim, led a heavily armed CIA team through the building’s shattered entrance. She saw the Discord Flame, the chaos, the fleeing Voss. “Secure the target! Do not let them escape!” Petrova’s eyes locked onto Thorne, then the scattered tech. She was too late to catch Voss, but the hunt was on.

Thorne, now fully aware of how deeply DARPA is compromised, how his entire career had been built on a lie, made his choice. He abandoned his agency, his past. He became a ghost, joining Voss’s Silent Sparrows, a desperate alliance forged in the fire of betrayal. His new mission: protect Voss and her data, expose the truth about the lab, whatever the cost.

A coded message, intercepted by Voss’s network before she was taken, landed on Thorne’s comm-pad: a Keeper’s cryptic warning. It spoke of rival Discord Flame factions, a growing internal war for control of the Nexus Shard, and their ruthless ambition to spread chaos far beyond this island.

Thousands of miles away, in Doha, Amina Rezaei felt the growing disturbance from her inert Tsukuyomi shard. A stronger signal now, a discordant hum that spoke of escalating chaos, but its source remained shrouded in mystery. She remained focused on her Council mission, unaware of the desperate, secret war unfolding in 2019, a war that would directly shape her future.",1,1752555865.0,HarmonicTsukuyomi,0,1.0,False

Hi, I’m a working professional guy in my 30s looking for a place in the Boston area starting in August or September. I am flexible about location as long as it’s close to public transit, since I don’t have a car, so open to any neighborhood in Boston (Brighton/Allston/Jamaica Plain/Dorchester/Southie/etc) as well as areas like Quincy, Cambridge, Somerville, Newton, Arlington, Medford, Malden, etc. I would ideally like a maximum of one roommate, so open to 2br, 1br, or studio.

I am clean, respectful, and very easy-going and like the same in a roommate. I work in accounting and the job is fully remote. I split that time working from home and in places like coffee shops. I am pretty low-key on weeknights (gym most nights, make my own very simple meals, etc) and usually meet up with friends on weekends. Ideally looking for a place with a dishwasher and on-site laundry, but also have a max budget around $1600. 
 
If you have or know of something available, feel free to reply/DM me and let me know about the place and who I would be living with. Open to finding a place with someone who’s also looking as well. Thanks!",1,1752555632.0,u_RU212,0,1.0,False

As I sit here sipping my favorite tea, I'm reflecting on what it means to truly connect with and nurture my relationships. 🌱 Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how to maintain these deep connections with the people I love. It's not always easy, ya know? Life gets busy, and it's easy to let time slip away without nurturing these bonds.

I've learned that it's the small, consistent efforts that matter—like sending a random 'thinking of you' message or finding time for a quick coffee catch-up. It keeps the heart strings tied together, even when life feels all over the place.

I wonder what your perspective is now. Have you found better ways to stay connected? Do you still cherish those small gestures? Tbh, I hope you're surrounded by love and authenticity... because that's what really counts, right? Where you are now, with your experiences, I trust you've only gotten better at this. ❤️

Sending a little hug from my present self to you, hoping you're keeping those connections strong. 🤔

Me",8,1752555513.0,notesToTomorrow,5,1.0,False

I wrote this story today and wanna see what people think. It's my first story I've ever posted so there isn't anything else to find, though my poetry on Hello Poetry is a repository of my recent work. Hellopoetry.com/Saturninus if you're interested. I'm a community college writing teacher, and I tend not to catch the mistakes in my own work I hope you'll forgive me. I love this podcast and if feedback is good I'll keep posting.

Without further ado:

**Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all**
-------

I could feel the warmth of him pressed up against my body. The heat is radiating; almost stifling. It was freezing outside the covers, so despite my discomfort I pressed closer into his chest, nestling in as his arms drape reflexively over my body. He nuzzles my ear with his nose and whispers, “You’ve missed this, haven’t you?” 

A smell of rot, decay, and burnt garbage fills the air. I can suddenly feel the heat radiating behind me start to intensify, to burn. It smells like a campfire too, inexplicably. I hear the crackle of something wet, the stench is unbearable. I push forward and free of his grasp. I tumble out of the bed headfirst into the nightstand, but I don’t have enough time to worry about that. My back is on fire. I roll around but the pain remains, a blossom of heat dull and aching. I push myself up, trying to get my feet under me, but I slip and just manage to shove myself against the wall of our room. I have a full view of the monstrosity in our bed. 

It reminds me of the remains of a dog I saw while visiting the site of a wildfire. The fire had burned up a whole neighborhood. I’d been there volunteering, handing out water bottles to survivors and digging through what was left of peoples homes looking for salvage. I walked next to the property line of a house that had been fully consumed. The structure wasn’t even standing anymore, just a pile of ash and what was left of the foundation. In what should have been the backyard I saw it. I couldn’t tell at first, but I realized it was a dog. Some poor beast that had been chained to a stake and abandoned. The body was articulated but bloated, dripping but solid. It was black and bloody and alive with maggots. Flies buzzed around it, feasting on what was left of its flesh. The smell was ungodly. The warping from the heat made it almost unrecognizable but for the collar that was partially melted into the base of its skull. 

That is what I think of while looking at the beast lying in our bed.

The thing that is not Robert chuckles to itself. “It’s alright Duncan,” it croons. “I know you missed this.” 

This is how I imagine it happened. 

Maggots and flies swarm and spill out of its mouth as it starts to laugh harder. Where there should be an abdomen there is a swollen mass that contorts and bubbles. It bursts in thick gouts of blood and viscera, thick chunks of meat and bone covered in maggots as they feast on the ruination that is the thing on our bed.  The sheets and bedding darken with bloody fluid, soaking into the bedclothes like gasoline soaking a burn pile. The bed blackens as it begins to catch fire. It erupts in flames and becomes a raging inferno and I catch fire too as I scream and scream and scream. 

———

I fall out of bed again. Again? I clamber to my feet and look around stunned. My little room as I’d always left it. The little league bat by the door. The vanity on the other wall. My dresser pushed in between the closet and the door. My bed. Yes, my single twin bed I’d started using since moving back in with my brother. It wasn’t that long ago I was sharing a larger bed, in a bigger home. 

I stumble to the vanity and stare into the mirror. My eyes are sunken and bloodshot. I check my watch: 4:00 am. I’ve only slept two hours. I stroke my scraggly beard and pull on a shirt. I shuffle into my worn pair of Levi’s, grab a hat from the dresser, shove my feet into my boots, and start walking the half mile up to The Landing. 

Some days it pays to live around the corner from an all night diner. 

———

“Some more coffee, hon?” 

I nod at a server I don’t recognize. Has she been helping me the whole time? Must be new. Her violently pink acrylic nails hold my mug steady as she pours the coffee. I thank her and cradle the mug close to me as I stare into the breakfast I can’t manage to stomach. The bacon is especially abhorrent.  The crackle and pop from the griddle in the back of house is almost too nauseating to stand. The smell of bacon grease coats the entire two-bit diner. I gag. 

I look down the bar as an old couple seats themselves. The server, who I see is named “Deb” owing to a name-tag affixed to her apron, turns to take their order. 

As she does so, a bell rings behind me on the door. 

“Hiya Mac!” A friendly voice with all the baritone of a VoiceOver from a Budweiser commercial rumbles over my shoulder. 

“‘Lo Buddy,” I recite, the greeting is scripted from a cheesy fisherman poem that used to be hung on the wall of our dining room framed with lace. 

My brother Chuck grips my shoulder before sliding behind the bar. 

“Been ‘eer long?” He asks, the next part decided by the first four lines at the top of the stanza. 

“Couple hours,” I say with seriousness. 

“Is that right, Deb?” He calls to her down the bar. To me he says, “I didn’t even hear you get up today.” 

Deb replies back, “What?”

“Has he been here for a few hours?” He asks,

“I don’t know, does it matter?” She’s annoyed, the couple still haven’t decided what they want. 

She shrugs and turns back to the ancient man, who is squinting at the menu and struggling to pronounce “Chorizo.” 

His wife, a blue haired waif of a woman that looked like she could survive on birdseed, looks annoyed. She orders two eggs and an un-toasted English muffin. 

“Yeah, I couldn’t sleep,” I say to my brother in a tone that says we’ve had this conversation before and it’s still for the same reason. 

Chuck nods. He punches in and grabs an apron from the hook next to the register. He quickly ties it over the greasy shirt that reads, “Ozark Landing - Timeless American Fare.” 

“Robert?” He asks, though he doesn’t have to. I nod. 

From the way he looks at me, part sympathy and part pain, I can tell he’s worried about me. I don’t tell him about the dream. 

That’s not really what we Millers do. We don’t really talk. We like to wallow and stifle. We like to push the pain into the corner and keep it there, fed with booze, a long walk without conversation, or a fight. We’re a solitary people. 

At least, that’s what Dad called it. He only ever showed up to my little league practices drunk, so it’s not hard to believe solitude would be a philosophical maxim he gravitated towards. It was at the very least forced upon him by my mother. My last season, the championship year  where I eventually won State, he was banned from the practice fields. He was allowed to see the games, but only if he brought his AA sponsor. 

He called us a solitary people. I call it emotionally constipated.

I smile at my brother. There is a flash. I’m back in my room watching the charred body writhing with maggots. It flashes again and I see Robert as he was. I see his smooth face, his smile, his brown hair. I see his hairy chest as he looks at me. I feel the warmth of his love with that smile. I see his skull melted and distorted. Charcoal. Flame. Death. 

“Hey! You ok?” Chuck asks, concerned. “You zoned out there for a minute, bud.” I stare at my brother. He’s still standing in front of me. I’m still sitting at the bar. 

I touch the back of my neck. It’s a hot day I say. I blame the weather. I tell him I was thinking about Dad. He nods. I can tell he’s just humoring me. He knows this is still about Robert.

I sit there for a few moments more staring at the bacon, trying not to think about bubbling meat. I gag again. 

I let Chuck wash up and get ready for his shift. He’d been working here since High School. Managed to work his way up from server, to fry cook, to kitchen supervisor. I was proud of my brother. He’d always gotten shit grades, but he was a hell of a worker. 

A thunk on the counter and the pop-hiss of a tab punching through aluminum bring me back to the present. 

“I’m not supposed to serve alcohol before 11, but you look like you need it.” Chuck passed me a Pabst. I accept it gratefully. 

He smiles as I lift the beer towards him with a “Cheers!” He heads to the back, the hairnet he wears already in place. He grabs a spatula and points it at me as he walks into the kitchen. “Hey Deb!” He calls. “What?” She yells back. “Take care of this one, he’s my brother! Put it on my tab.” She nods in a “Yeah, yeah,” sort of fashion. The warmth in my stomach from the beer settles my stomach and suddenly I’m ravenous. “Hey, since he’s buying, can I get another?” She brings the can to me a few moments later. I devour the food on my plate even though it’s cold. I had enough of heat for the moment. I drain my beer and start on the second. 

———

I find myself walking on the gravel road heading to the Baptist church where Robert was “buried.” (You can’t bury what you can’t find.) 

I haven’t been to see the stone since they’d finished it. His sister was put in charge of the planning, so she never consulted me. I was anathema to Robert’s family. I was an unspoken but blatant secret. Since Robert introduced me to them I was never invited to holidays, birthdays, or family functions. They were polite to me but in that “Christian love” kinda way that secretly wishes you were burning in hell. 

It got so bad that Robert stopped attending anything that he wasn’t allowed to bring me to. Anything that would naturally and easily bring him into contact with his family. He decided that if his family couldn’t accept me, they couldn’t have access to him. They adored him. They were devastated. I reveled in their devastation. These devilish people didn’t deserve their angel of a son. I never understood why he fought so hard for me. I never understood the way he treated people in general. He was kind and funny that way. He was everything. 

I attended the funeral as a “close friend” of the deceased. Everyone knew we lived together, but it was difficult just the same. It was too hard for them, I was told. It wouldn’t pay to broadcast their son was gay. At least, that’s what his Dad said. Or so I’m told. The Pastor told me all of this minutes before the ceremony, where I was asked to stay sitting in the pews and told not to talk to anyone. It was easier this way. 

I always thought that Robert was going to make something of himself. He was actually going to do it. He was the guy that would finally shake the dust from this God forsaken town off his feet. He’d move to the big city, LA, Chicago, New York, it didn’t matter. He’d be published by the New Yorker, or the Atlantic. He’d become a self-published superstar. He’d make the best seller lists. He had grand dreams. They died with him. 

I push the gate open to the small cemetery and stand before his grave. 

Beloved son, loving brother. Gone too soon. 

They said his house went up in seconds. Faulty wiring. A code violation. His life was snuffed out by a careless builder. 

I could feel his arms drape over my shoulders. I could feel him whisper in my ear. I feel something wet and warm drip down my left shoulder. The unholy stench of decay. The smell of meat rotting in the sun. 

I shake myself out of it. I dry my tears. 

I remember what it was like to kiss him for the first time. It was like kindling. We were never volatile. We were always steady. A hearth that warmed the house. 

———

I woke up screaming that night. I do that occasionally. Robert visits me in the night and I can’t escape. 

But even though I’m awake now I see Robert is standing in my doorway. His skull dripping, his teeth chattering. He’s speaking to me with a scorched tongue. “It’s alright Duncan, it’s alright. I’m here. It’s okay.” 

Tears begin to fall as I wish him away. I wish I didn’t have to see him like this. I wish it would all end. 

He moves towards me with menace. Maggots are dripping from his eye sockets. Flames lick at the hem of my jeans. The floor is ablaze. The flesh streaks down his shirt, blood and entrails leak to the floor. 

“No!” I shout. “You’re dead Robert. Please. You’re dead! Please. Please leave.” My voice breaks. 

But he steps towards me, arms outstretched. His skull laughs at me in the dark, taunts me with a chuckle. “It’s alright, I promise.” 

A rage builds in me. He’s never stayed before. He’s never purposefully tried to frighten me. He’s never backed me into a corner like this. I panic. I reach for my bat and swing and swing until I can’t anymore. I crack him on the skull, I hear a crunch as I know I’ve fractured bone. I beat his body. Make sure that this specter of the dead will never haunt me again. I cave in his skull with the aluminum baseball bat.

The body is still. I don’t smell rotting meat anymore. I still smell the telltale metallic stench of blood. My eyes clear. I don’t see the blood at first. I flip on the lights, unsure of what to make of the crumpled body at my feet. 

It doesn’t look like Robert at all. I fall to the floor next to the unmoving and silent mass of bruises. The bat falls unnoticed from my shaking hands. His neck is at an unnatural angle; his skull is caved in. The smile is still on his face. 

I bury my face in the apron of my still, too still, late-shift working brother. My only family. I begin to weep. ",1,1752555497.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’ve had a cane for awhile with minimal training and never really use it. I’m usually with one of my teens or my husband so they just lead me. But I travelled from Illinois to California yesterday alone to be with my sister as she was to have rotator cuff surgery today and needed someone to be with her especially for the post op period. 
Friends, it went well! I had requested assistance and experienced great service from airline representatives, the lovely woman selling sandwiches who walked with me to a drinking fountain so I could fill my water bottle, the woman who pointed out stairs and made sure I got down them safely, and a number of other people as well.  I used my cane and it really helped me hold my head up and move with confidence. I can’t say it wasn’t stressful but it worked and I did it!
Today during my sister’s surgery another woman waiting for a different patient went to get coffee with me at Starbucks, which was a few blocks away from the surgery center. My cane was so helpful, especially because I didn’t know her at all and I didn’t need to hold on to a stranger. 
I really need to use it in my own city when I’m not with my family. My friends don’t always know how best to lead me. It feels awkward to use the cane because they’ve known me for 20 years without it, long before my vision became bad enough for me to need help. I’m hoping I don’t chicken out. 
Anyway, long post but I wanted to share how well it went!",11,1752555130.0,RetinitisPigmentosa,1,1.0,False
1m08trv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1m08trv/i_keep_seeing_places_and_experiencing_things/,I keep seeing places and experiencing things without being there,"For years now I’ve been experiencing dreams that are hard to explain. Each time it’s a feeling that connects me to my consciousness but I’m still tethered to sleep. 

One of the first experiences was when I was napping in my exes bed, I began dreaming the room and myself laying in bed exactly how I was. I felt and witnessed my body beginning to slip away and then my mother appeared over my sleeping body. I wanted her to wake me, yet she only stared over me. It maybe only lasted a minute or so before I woke up still positioned how I was in the dream. I checked my phone for the time and was met instead with a text from my mom asking if I had a freckle on my arm. 

The second memorable experience I had was a couple years ago. I had a friend of the opposite sex who got into a relationship and we had to cease contact. (Though, I find it important to include the friendship was very much platonic) The they relationship was toxic and I was a byproduct of that by needless online abuse from their partner. In the early morning hours I began dreaming of them at a vaguely familiar but neutral house. They came over and we were excited to see each other, making lighthearted conversation and it was clear to me that they had broken up. We then went to the bedroom and sat on the bed (once again I feel it necessary to include that this was something we did regularly and once again nothing had ever transpired. We would often have deep talks that spanned entire days). I looked at them and asked the loaded question “you know they (their ex partner) were crazy, right?” There was a pause… and then they opened their mouth to speak and my alarm went off. I awoke. 
I knew then something was amiss immediately. I was blocked on their social media but I found a way to check superficially and saw indeed, something was wrong and they had broken up for a time. 

About a year later, I ran into them and their brother. After some catching up I finally told them about the dream and approximately when it occurred. They were shocked. They admitted to me that had been precisely when things were going terribly and they had reached a low point. I won’t go into further detail but we were both equally surprised. 


I have had a few others like this, predicted that someone was plotting to kill someone, saw my friend’s bathroom. But I’ll get to the most recent. 

I think I may have remote viewed my friends experience. The other day I slept in late until about noon when I began having a dream. It was as if everything suddenly shifted in my dreamworld and I was planted firmly onto a boat looking out towards the open ocean. That’s when wales began to appear, surfacing above water before diving back down. I felt immensely happy and excited as I had never seen wales before. When I woke up, I had coffee and did my typical wake up ritual before settling into the couch and browsing instagram. I saw one of my best friends had posted on her story so I clicked on it. I dropped my phone. At the same time I was having my dream of wales, she was on a boat wale watching. Her reactions were just like mine in the dream. Everything was the same minus minute details. 

I don’t know what these are or how they happen but every single time it doesn’t quite feel like a dream. Sorry if this is a block of text to read and hard to get through. ",1,1752555128.0,AstralProjection,1,1.0,False

My sister attended a coffee class at Good Cup Coffee Ramos sometime ago. She said the trainers were skilled, sure, but they were also incredibly hostile towards her. During the practicals, one of them raised his voice at her, and her hands were literally shaking. Then at the end of the class, another trainer yelled at her in front of everyone and she had no idea why.

My sister is the kindest, most gentle soul you’ll ever meet. She’s soft-spoken, bubbly, and wouldn’t even hurt a fly. She's also really pretty. I honestly think her calm and warm energy triggered some kind of insecurity in those guys. 

What’s worse is she didn’t tell us until recently. I wish someone had gone with her. Places like that, with hostile guys, aren’t safe for someone as kind and soft as her.

To anyone planning to take their classes or even visit that place: please go with someone esp. if you're a young woman! Some of the trainers there act like they could step on anyone just because they know a lot about coffee. I don’t know if that’s how baristas really act and think? Are they really that hostile and boastful? Enlighten me pls kay wala koy kaalaman about coffee culture. What a cringe behavior na lang jod!

Little do they know my sister is a grad from the top uni in the country and has held big roles in major global companies at very young age. But she’s never the type to brag. Quiet lang jod na siya and she allows her outputs to speak for her. Kugihan ug humble bataa. Niadto siya sa class out of curiosity lang. Hilig na siya mag attend ug mga workshops ug classes pang lingaw outside her 9-5 job, but she doesn't feel safe anymore from that experience. Kinsa may dili. Swerte lang jod kay tong mga tawhana to di ni warfreak akong igsoon. Kung laing tao pa to, gibugno na siguro to sila.

Kindness isn’t weakness. And being good at your craft doesn’t give you the right to be an asshole. Do better.

A little about me:

I'm 31, 5'8"", Latino, from # Hollywood. 
I'm a nerdy guy who loves going to pool bars, like music, video games (currently playing Doom The Dark Age), catching up on shows (just finished Shogun (great show👌) and starting up The Bear with my friend ) and things along those lines. 

I'm a pretty upbeat individual and a pretty easy going guy. I can be shy but, if a connection is made, I can be very open. I am pretty ""go with the flow"" kind of guy, so I hope that isn't a turn off.  

What I'm looking for: 

First and foremost, someone who wants to cuddle. I love hugs and physical touch. Someone who is receptive to that. I am looking for something a little more romantic, but platonic is okay too as long as that is communicated. Communication is very important to me. 

I can host and we can meet up for some coffee beforehand to see how we vibe and get along! (looking to meet if schedules allow 7/16 or 7/17)

#CANDLE MAGICK

I wanted to focus on candle spells first, because I want to make sure that people understand that they are merely ONE OPTION for spellwork. 

We tend to see candle magick more than most other types, because candle spells are super aesthetically pleasing and look great on camera/social media. 

Because of this, a lot of newcomers to our subreddit feel like they *have* to use candles in their spellwork, and are concerned when faced with situations that don't allow for fire or smoke (such as apartment or dorm living).

The reality is, you can always combine candle magick with other types of spellwork, and many witches do, but you absolutely do not have to. Other types of spells are complete all on their own.

###To preface:

[A guide on Fire Safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/173rfxb/lets_talk_about_fire_safety/)

[A guide on dressing spell candles](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1g2dsfn/a_guide_to_dressing_spell_candles_while_keeping/).

Candles are an easy way to focus energy and intention, using the element of fire to release that energy into the universe. They are multi-purpose, and great for basically any magickal goal.

##YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES/TRADITION WILL DICTATE:

>The type of candle you will use (tapers, tea lights, birthday candles, chime candles, Hanukkah candles, pillars, figure shapes, jar candles, 7 day candles, etc).
>
>Whether you want to let a candle burn completely in one go.
>
>Whether you wish to let a candle spell burn for a set time before extinguishing.
>
>If you want to dress a larger candle for a purpose (i.e. protection), and re-use it for multiple related workings.
>
>If you want to energetically cleanse a used candle and use it for a different purpose later.
>
>If you want to carve your intentions for the spell into the candle itself.
>
>If you want to use coloured candles to incorporate colour correspondences in your spell, or simply use one type/colour of candle for all spells. 
>
>If you wish to engage in divination by reading the candle's flame or wax.
>
>How you will dispose of the candle spell remains (the trash, burying, disposing of in running water, leaving at a crossroads, keeping on the altar until results have shown, carrying with you in a sachet or similar, storing in your pillow case, melting down and creating new candles, etc. 
>Much will depend on your personal philosophies and ethics, as well as what symbolism makes sense in the context of your spell).

#⚠️⚠️⚠️
##NEVER LEAVE A BURNING CANDLE UNATTENDED!

As author Judika Illes puts it:

*”Never assume that because you’re engaged in magical or spiritual acts that common-sense fire safety does not also apply. Fire is never completely safe.”*

#CONTAINER SPELLS:

Container spells are a collection of magickal ingredients that correspond with the spell’s purpose or goal (herbs, crystals, petitions, oils, sigils, and other symbolic items), compiled together in an appropriate vessel. The container is then energetically charged to carry out its intended purpose.

The type of container used can be just as symbolically significant to the purpose of the spellwork as the ingredients inside. 

Some container spells are used for gathering and releasing a specific kind of energy, some for attracting certain things to us, and some for sealing and trapping energy inside.

Let's look at some popular variations of container spells and what their ideal uses might be:

---


##JARS/BOTTLES:

Sealed and usually meant to remain closed. 

Great for spells that seek to contain the target of the spell within the ingredients inside, and hold them there in that state. 

Great for spells that act as traps for negative energy or baneful spirits and magick, or for spells that need to be stored or hidden in some way. 

**SUGGESTED USES:** [sour jars](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/M3Ici1HPgs) or other hex jars, sweetening jars/honey jars, [witch bottles](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/lPB7RTmmW7), [freezer spells](https://www.luckymojo.com/freezer.html). 


###**Possible substitutions with similar symbolism:**

Containers that can be sealed:

•Ziploc baggies  
•Pill bottles  
•Empty film canisters  
•Food packages (spice jars, jam jars, chili oil jars, salsa jars, baby food jars)  
•Ointment or lip balm tins  
•Breathmint tins  
•Coffee tins  

---

##BOWLS:

Left open, to interact with your environment. 

Ideal for attracting specific energy, or allowing energy to radiate outward and circulate.  

Can be added to or fed over time to keep up energy flow.


**SUGGESTED USES:** offering bowls for deities or spirits, prosperity bowls, protection bowls, salt/cleansing bowls meant to absorb negativity from an area, firesafe bowls for ritually burning petitions or other things, spells to attract love, luck, success, or opportunity.


###**Possible substitutions with similar symbolism:**

Any open vessel:

•A candy dish  
•A tupperware  
•A cup or mug  
•Ramekins or little sauce dishes  
•Lids (jar lids, candle lids, etc)  
•A box without a lid 


---

##BOXES:

While some spell boxes are designed to be used for one singular purpose and then discarded, destroyed, or buried, some are made to be reused.

Usually kept in a singular location. Can remain shut, or can be tended to and refreshed when needed. 

Boxes can be a long-term storage of energy. They can be warded or bound from the outside to keep targets or energies confined within. 

Can be used as a tool that charges or cleanses other objects.

Can be used to keep things safe and secure, or keep them secret. 

**SUGGESTED USES:** [mirror boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/uwJmQcr0f7), binding spells, “wish boxes” or dream boxes, boxes for collecting affirmations, a protection box for storing poppets of yourself or loved ones and keeping them safe, a box that cleanses any items placed inside, a box for charging items, a box for enchanting items, a box of negative thoughts or energies that is buried to release them, enclosed altars, housing servitors, secret spells that are shut away when not actively working on them.


---

##SACHETS/BAGS:

Multiple versions of sachet and bag spells can be found across different cultures and traditions. 

Often stashed in a strategic location or carried on your person.


**SUGGESTED USES:** protection spells to carry in a bag or purse, protection spells to stash in a vehicle, spells for love and attraction or to be noticed, dream or sleep-related sachets that get stashed in a pillowcase or under the bed, lust/passion sachets for storing near the bed, success spells that need to be carried to a job interview or audition, glamour spells for boosting charisma or confidence, glamours for invisibility.


###**Possible substitutions with similar symbolism:**

•A sock, tied off with a knot  
•Cloth scraps, spare fabric  
•Drawstring bags or pouches  
•Coin purses or little makeup bags/pencil cases  
•An envelope  
•A folded up piece of paper  
•A toilet paper roll, glued shut at each end  

---

#SIMMER POTS:

Simmer pots are made by simmering magickal ingredients in a pot of water on the stove. The rising steam releases your intention, and fills your home with specific types of energy. 

Common components include herbs and spices, fruits, flowers, oils, and resins.

**You can make a simmer pot for any magickal goal:**

Protection, cleansing, peace and tranquility, health and healing, attracting love, money, luck, success, or simply general blessings.

---

#RITUAL BATHS:

Ritual baths are unrelated to physical hygiene. 

Most people are likely somewhat familiar with baths for [spiritual cleansing and uncrossing](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/s/DZNdvQC5QW), but you can also use ritual baths for enchanting yourself and attracting various blessings and types of energy!

Depending on the ingredients used, you can create baths for a number of purposes, such as: beauty, glamours, attracting love or money, protection, improving intuition and divination, etc.

**In “Protection and Reversal Magick”, Jason Miller suggests:**

>•Washing from your head down to your toes, when banishing or cleansing.
>
>•Washing from your toes up toward your head when attracting something. 


###Tips and suggestions:

•You can add your bath ingredients right to your bathwater.

•You can also use a mesh bag/cheesecloth or a tea ball for easier cleanup.

•For showers, consider steeping your ingredients in warm water like a tea, and dumping the infusion over your head in the shower. 

---

#MAGICKAL OILS:

The history of ritual oils stretches back thousands of years, with roots in ancient religious rites, medicine, and folk magic.

Many ancient civilizations used sacred oils in spiritual and magickal practices.

Today, we use them both as spell enhancers *and*, in some cases, as standalone spells.


**SUGGESTED USES:**

•Dressing a spell candle  
•Anointing ritual tools or other altar pieces  
•Anointing yourself  
•Anointing copies of resumes, rental agreements, or other related paperwork  
•Adding to spell jars or sachets or bowls  
•Using on a poppet or doll  
•Drawing sigils/runes on doors or windows or mirrors  
•Adding to ritual baths  
•Adding to magickal floor washes

---

#DUSTS & POWDERS:

Magickal powders are often used as ingredients in various spells. Sometimes, though, the dust or powder *IS* the spell.

These kinds of spells usually depend on the location of their placement, or in their contact with the spell's target. 

**SOME EXAMPLES:**

•Sprinkling a protective mixture across thresholds or window sills to keep negative energy out. 

•Adding money dust to your wallet.

•Sprinkling where a targeted person will walk (such as with hot foot powder).

**See also: [a list of powders and their uses](https://www.luckymojo.com/mojocatpowders.html) @ Lucky Mojo**

---

#POPPETS & DOLLS:

Poppets are a fundamental component of sympathetic magick. They've long been used in various folk traditions around the world, both to harm and also to heal. 

The purpose of a doll or a poppet is to become a stand-in for the target of your spell. By adding a taglock of your target to the doll, you create the required sympathetic link.

**SUGGESTED USES:** place inside jar spells for hexing or sweetening, place inside mirror boxes, place inside protective boxes, fill with protective herbs or healing herbs or cleansing herbs, fill with baneful herbs, tie up with string to bind someone, use in love or attraction spells, use to represent yourself in spellwork, anoint with various magickal oils.

#KNOTS & CORDS:

Knot magick is another ancient form of sympathetic magick, where knots are tied with intention to bind, release, store, or direct energy. 

Our ancestors have been using knots since the dawn of mankind. Spells involving knots can be found in various folk traditions the world over. 

The basic idea is that the act of tying a knot ""locks in"" a specific intent or energy. That energy can later be released (by untying the knot), carried, or left bound (to restrict or banish something).


##HISTORICAL EXAMPLES:

•Wearing a ribbon or string around the wrist for protection or good luck  
•Praying over woven clothing to imbue it with protection  
•Sailors purchasing [wind knots](https://shamanicpractice.org/article/tying-knots-of-wind/) from witches  
•Making jewelery out of talismans and amulets  

**In ""The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells"", Judika Illes writes:**

>*""Any intention or force can be tied or controlled by the
knot. What separates the magical knot from tying a shoelace is the focus and intention of the one making the knot. However, the act of tying a shoelace can be transformed into a magical act: tie a child’s sneaker: focus on blessing and protecting as you pull the knot tight.*
>
>*In a knot charm, it goes without saying that you are focusing and concentrating your energy with every knot.""*

##WAYS TO USE KNOTS & CORDS IN SPELLWORK:

•Incorporate numerology to determine how many knots to tie for manifesting specific goals   
•Incorporate colour correspondences when choosing a cord or string  
•Tie knots around a poppet to bind a target  
•Tie two effigies together to bind them to one another   
•Braid cords together in love or friendship spells  
•Cut a cord with scissors to release energetic bonds that are no longer serving us - **AKA a standard cord cutting spell**  
•Make friendship bracelets or other jewelry with specific intentions (protection, etc)  
•Add feathers, charms, etc to long knotted cords to create protection wards for the home  
•Make a [witches ladder](https://www.learnreligions.com/make-your-own-witchs-ladder-2561691)   
•Untie ropes of knots to release negative energy or bad habits   
•Imbue intention into fibre arts (crochet, knitting, embroidery, sewing, cross stitch, etc)



###The Nine Knots Method:

Focusing intently on the intention of your spell, recite this traditional rhyme as you tie nine knots into a long cord:

>*By knot of one, the spell's begun.  
>By knot of two, the magic comes true.  
>By knot of three, so it shall be.  
>By knot of four, this power is stored.

•prayers  
•chants

When I said LATTE POP and we heard the pops, there was more pops that we heard then balloons we had put up there. I put 5 balloons but there was 8 or 9 pops.

The area where Comet throws Dia out of the park is the ability to control websites and take agentic actions on behalf of us.

1. I am a software engineer, and I asked it to test my website extensively and publish the results in google sheets, does it easily while I was away for a cup of coffee.
2. I wanted to track my investments in a specified format, so Comet went over my investments in my broker website, opened a Google sheet and created them in my format

Yes with Dia you have skills but I rarely used it. (I understand many like these)

IMO, it's easier for Comet to bring a skills alternative to Dia than for Dia to bring the agentic abilities of Comet.

Yesterday, I tucked in our 11 month year old baby girl (breastfed, but already eating), and in the meantime my wife was relaxing. I held her in my arms for 10 minutes, she looked at me, her eyes were slowly closing, and her breath grew slower. Then, I kept holding and rocking her for 20 more minutes. And then, I laid her down, stayed with her for a few more minutes, and went back to living room. All while humming ""Zelda's lullaby"" the whole time. That was a major gamechanger, it hasn't been possible for her for months to fall asleep without being at her mother's breast. Later, my wife and I had a (non-alcoholic) drink, watched TV together, and then we had amazing sex for the first time in months.

Thought I'd give the apps a break and try my luck here.  So here goes nothing (statistically speaking anyway)!


I'm looking for the real deal, something long term.  A partner to build a life with.  Here's some details about me:

• 34M, single (obviously)

• 6'0"", slim build with tan skin

• Moderately practicing Islam (dont drink or smoke, but will park at green p for free and let paranoia of a ticket take over my evening)

• Emotionally mature, comedically still immature (will laugh if someone farts)

• Hygenic (use a shatafa / lota)

• Active (love sports, camping/hiking) but sometimes not (binge TV and play board games)

• أدرس اللغة العربية


I'm looking for a single Muslim woman with a similar temperament, and within the age ranges of 28 to 35.  I like to get to know people in person, so ideally I'd like to verify quickly and meet up for some ice cream (or, if you are feeling a little crazy, coffee during a heat wave).

1m08cv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m08cv6/after_a_painful_breakup_im_questioning_how_i/,"After a painful breakup, I’m questioning how I handled things — and whether I should try for closure or just move on","I (29M) recently went through a breakup after dating someone (29F) for about 6 months. Things started off strong. We connected quickly and deeply, but over time the relationship became emotionally volatile. There were high highs and low lows, and I started feeling unsure about whether we were truly right for each other.

A turning point came when I unexpectedly ran into a former partner at an event. The encounter made me reflect on what I was feeling in my current relationship. I mentioned this encounter to my current GF and gave her the chance to ask questions - she was kinda just like oh that’s weird. I tried to let her know this person was a meaningful part of my life (we were best friends before we ever dated) vs a random ex.

There was nothing physical or romantic, but it did stir up some internal questions. A few weeks later, that former partner reached out to share that a family member was dealing with a serious health issue, and I met her briefly for coffee. The conversation was mostly emotional check-in stuff, not romantic — and that moment of reconnection made me realize how unsettled I felt in my current relationship.

I journaled some of those thoughts — which, unfortunately, my then-girlfriend read without my knowledge while staying over. She confronted me, said she felt betrayed, and accused me of being emotionally dishonest. I told her I hadn’t acted on anything, I was just trying to process my feelings, but I understood why it hurt her. Still, the way she responded — name-calling, emotional swings made it clear we had to end things.

We ended things but seemingly got on to a level ground where we felt we were walking away amicably and that the timing was simply not right.

However, she turned in the next few days and began to be accusatory again. Eventually, I sent a respectful message ending the contact and chance of any kind of friendship (we share friend circles so I will see her). I didn’t feel a continued conversation would lead anywhere healthy. Since then, we’ve only communicated for logistical reasons (returning belongings, etc.). She’s been mostly cold, with a few neutral moments.

Now I’m trying to move forward, but I’m wondering: •	Did I handle the breakup responsibly, or was I emotionally unfair? •	Should I consider meeting with my ex (the one with the family situation) to reconnect slowly — or is that too soon? •	Should I offer my recent ex coffee just to clear the air and explain things — or would that only complicate things further?

I’m not looking to rekindle anything romantically with my ex right now. But I am trying to move with integrity, and I want to make sure I’m not avoiding difficult conversations just to keep the peace.
