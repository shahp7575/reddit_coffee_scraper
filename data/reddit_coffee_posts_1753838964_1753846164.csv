Do yall think I have a shot? ü§îüôä,"For context, we met in undergrad a few years ago.  I always had a little bit of a crush on her, but never thought to pursue it due to my own confidence issues / some timing problems, as we only began getting closer my last year of uni when I was really busy, and prior to that was COVID etc.  However, throughout college, she was in a lot of my mutual circles and also roomies with one of my good female friends.  When I‚Äôd come over, we always had these really long deep talks about various topics and she would occasional give me more physically based compliments (like my shirt or swiping up on stories with a flame emoji etc), but nothing much beyond that/she‚Äôs also just a very expressive person so I never thought much of it.  There was one random time in undergrad though she asked me to hangout on a night that I happened to be moving to another city; my friend, her roommate was out of town.  I couldn‚Äôt make it unfortunately and I told her I‚Äôd hit her up later, but it always stayed with me wondering why she wanted to hangout that night lol. 

To be honest, she is also a really beautiful girl and very popular in our friend group, and at the time I was dealing with self esteem issues / genuinely wasn‚Äôt pursuing a lot of goals I had for myself as far as style/exercise etc, so if there were any other signs, I probably didn‚Äôt pick up on them or doubted them.  I also knew most guys she dated were generally pretty conventionally attractive guys so I assumed maybe that I wasn‚Äôt her type.  However I have always been pretty high achieving and well liked in our group tho so maybe I was also being too hard on myself for the physical insecurities I had, I may have been a bit hard on myself. I have also dated other girls before who were really attractive; I just had really shitty self esteem and tbh dating them didn‚Äôt make me feel much better about myself alone.  

Anyways, she always stayed in the back of my mind.  She graduated uni, and then we started hanging out more 1:1 in the past year.  The past few years I also have honestly had a bit of a glo up.  I started exercising and eating better, got on acne meds, started dressing/grooming better etc., and I have also dated some other girls since uni.  While it hasn‚Äôt really panned out with any of them, I think it has at least given me more confidence to approach women I‚Äôm into, whereas I used to just wait for them to come to me, and I did find that doing these things for myself made me feel a lot more confident than just whoever I was dating ever did. 

Anyway, I started noticing that she was touching me a lot when we would see each other (touching my arm, my hand, or leaning on me when I was scrolling on my laptop), and this didn‚Äôt appear to be the same way she reacted with everyone else.  That really got to me because physical touch is my top love language.  When we hung out 1:1, she would always have the same long sprawling conversations for hours on our interests/ideas about life etc.  This one time we went to an event together, and I ended up taking her out for dinner after cuz I had a gift card to some fancy place; it very much felt like a date although tbh I didn‚Äôt necessarily intend it that way.  I would have taken her there even if she was just a friend I wasn‚Äôt interested in.  Anyway, in the middle of the hangout she was telling me about being in therapy etc, then she stopped and asked if I was seeing anyone‚Äîthen she laughed, and said she ‚Äúmeant if I was seeing a therapist‚Ä¶but, are you seeing someone too?‚Äù There was another time we were hanging out, sharing a laugh in my car and she quite randomly asked me if I was interested in having kids in the future lol.  Idk, maybe I‚Äôm wild but I don‚Äôt think those are really very platonic questions.  Still, I was keeping my feelings at bay, honestly in retrospect because I was so afraid of the rejection.  I‚Äôve worked on my thought patterns a lot, but I think my self esteem earlier this year was probably still fragile to the point that being rejected by her might have made me at least momentarily spiral on my own self worth, so it was this back and forth that kept happening. 

Anyway, all that to say we kept chilling, but in retrospect even with those signs I realized that I‚Äôm not the most flirtatious person.  I‚Äôve worked on being more reciprocal with banter and things, as I think sometimes crushes can find me hard to read from what I‚Äôve been told before.  We have been in and out of contact since then, as she‚Äôs been going through a lot in her personal life and we are both generally busy people.  That being said, we hung out about a month ago and had a really beautiful time.  I invited her to coffee, and we ended up walking around our city all day, going to thrift shops, getting drinks at a local bar etc.  This time I was trying to be more initiating with touch and things, so I did touch her arm, her knee when we were sitting at the bar, etc.  She seemed into it.  She also told me she liked my shirt and told me a piece of jewelery I was wearing looked good on my skin tone.  She made a few comments that seemed kind of charged, like asking me if I thought the tramp stamp tattoo she wanted would look good on her, or showing me a button at a shop we went to that said ‚Äúwrap it up‚Äù in reference to condoms. Anyway, at the end of our hangout i really thought she was into me because she made this post on instagram (mind you I am not on social media at the moment) with a collage of photos of our day together, including our drinks next to each other, photos from a cafe we went to, a picture of our hands next to each other with rings we bought, pictures from an art gallery etc. with a really romantic song in the background. I know she had been going through a hard time then, so she really appreciated that day.  

Anyway, after this, we made plans to get drinks a couple weeks later, and she let me know she had to cancel because of some legitimate family issues; we now have drinks planned for this Friday.  I am planning to have a chill conversation with her to tell her how I feel and see how she feels/move forward from there.  I don‚Äôt want it to come off as some deep confession as that sounds way too intense, but I‚Äôd also be hella bummed tbh if it turns out she feels differently or just isn‚Äôt in a spot for that rn. 

What is your read on this?  Have I been overthinking making a serious move?  Is there a possibility I‚Äôm misreading all this and she just sees me as a really good friend?  Moreover, if she was into me, why wouldn‚Äôt she have stopped being into me despite my lack of picking up on her cues before etc?  Any tips for if she isn‚Äôt interested?  I suppose I thought that she might have lost interest by now, as everyone always says you have to make a move quickly etc.  Anyways, wish me luck üêí ",1,1753846020.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been married for 15 years to my husband. Just in this past year, something inside me shifted. It was like a light turned on, and I suddenly realized ‚Äî the life I've been living isn't normal or healthy.

What really opened my eyes was seeing other families ‚Äî especially dads at my kids‚Äô school and sports events ‚Äî showing up early for soccer with coffee for their wives, carrying chairs, helping with the younger siblings. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm alone. My husband is still sleeping off a night of drinking, and I know when I come home, he‚Äôll be angry. He‚Äôll complain about the house, about how I‚Äôm not doing enough, and question why I can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo better.‚Äù

I‚Äôve detached emotionally, but I still live in it every day. And lately, I find myself constantly daydreaming. Dreaming of a life where I have a supportive partner ‚Äî someone who helps, who loves me, who tells me I‚Äôm beautiful and that I‚Äôm enough. Sometimes, those daydreams are the only thing that get me through the day. And it hurts to think that this life I dream of may never be mine.

Here‚Äôs my question: Why do we stay? I know it‚Äôs complicated ‚Äî kids, finances, the house, the fear of the unknown. But I wish I was brave enough to take the leap. Right now, I just need to know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way.

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie**  
The Atlanta Dream (-4.5, implied probability \~71%) are the clear favorites against the Dallas Wings, and the stats back it up. Atlanta‚Äôs defense ranks 4th in the WNBA, allowing opponents to score just 74.2 points per game‚Äîa fortress so impenetrable, even a sieve would blush. Meanwhile, Dallas‚Äôs offense, which ranks 10th, has managed to outscore opponents by a grand total of‚Ä¶ 3 points this season. That‚Äôs less than the number of three-pointers Tiffany Hayes averages per game (1.8).

The Dream‚Äôs star, Allisha Gray, is a triple threat: leading the team in scoring, assists, and three-pointers (2.4 per game). She‚Äôs the kind of player who makes highlight reels and defensive coordinators weep. Conversely, Dallas‚Äôs offense is so inconsistent that their ‚Äúgame plan‚Äù might as well be ‚Äúhope for a traveling call.‚Äù

**Digest the News: Injuries, Rumors, and a Lack of Coffee**  
No major injuries disrupt Atlanta‚Äôs lineup, though one can‚Äôt help but wonder if their defense secretly runs on a diet of 12-hour naps and existential dread (for opponents). Dallas, on the other hand, has news of its own: their offense is so slow, it once lost a race to a sloth on a caffeine IV. Recent reports suggest their coaching staff is considering replacing the playbook with a Ouija board‚Äîanything for a spark of inspiration.

A lighter note: Dallas‚Äôs three-point shooting (led by Hayes at 1.8 per game) is about as reliable as a weather forecast in July. Atlanta‚Äôs defense, meanwhil

Hey trail fam üëã

I‚Äôve been building a web app to solve a real problem I kept running into during long runs and races: fueling. It‚Äôs called FuelForm AI, and it generates personalized fueling plans based on your race type, effort, duration, and bladder/flask setup. It uses AI to factor in course details, elevation, product preferences, and even image uploads like race maps or Strava screenshots.

üõ†Ô∏è It‚Äôs still in alpha, but functional and fast. I‚Äôm looking for feedback from real trail runners before a public launch. You have nothing to lose, it‚Äôs completely free (unless you want to buy me a coffee)! 

‚∏ª

üîê Access is limited right now

If you‚Äôre interested in testing and giving feedback, DM u/fuelformai for the link and access code. I‚Äôm keeping it invite-only for now to manage usage and stay focused on meaningful feedback.

You can also follow the project and join the conversation in the r/FuelForm subreddit.

‚∏ª

What it does:

‚úÖ Builds liquid-only or mixed fueling plans
‚úÖ Analyzes race URLs and course images
‚úÖ Customizes for your weight, intensity, preferred products
‚úÖ Outputs clean, easy-to-follow fueling instructions

This is a solo project built by a trail runner for trail runners. Your input would mean a lot.

Sharing my write up on MV in case it helps. My eldest is typical sulky teen.... my youngest wild one!

We stayed 3 nights in Santa Pension Elena... we got a family room which fit all 5 of us. The room is pretty basic, and small but had shower room. But for the price truly an amazing find. It had a very high mezzanine which my eldest took so he could escape a little from family dynamics. Given it was quite tight quarters they did well! We had to be v organised with our belongings!

 We loved the hostel vibe, free tea and coffee..we loved the free HUGE and TASTY breakfast. We enjoyed hanging out in the comman room and pretending we are in our 20s again. There were other families there.

We drove from San Jose...massive thunder storm on way. Took about 3 hours. We ate at 3RS in Santa Elena, you sit outside next to the truck. Great food and good price. 

Day 1 we went to cloud forest. I adored it...so magical. We had cloud and a bit of rain...it cleared during the afternoin. Personally I loved the cloud in the cloud forest and felt it was more magical with it... than when it disappeared. We saw a couti and armadillo.... we didn't have a guide. Our 2 youngest loved it. My eldest was quite underwhelmed walking in a wet forest but also this was our 1st main outing in CR. We walked all the paths probably around 9KM. The paths are well maintained and mostly flat (some are very pretty steep but you can avoid them). The brownies in the cafe are very tasty...

We ate again at 3Rs in the evening.

Day 2 we did El Tiger. The drive there was pretty hairy lots of pot holes.. though my partner (driver) found it fine just very slow going. We found out the night before that our youngest was free (under 6) and we recieved 15% off booking online. We went for the full package as honestly we are quite shocked by how much the food is generally in CR and felt the difference in price was worth it. The trail is a lot of steps up and down, I'm not the fittest so it was challenging, but far from impossible and definitely worth it. The waterfalls are incredible and the hanging bridges fun. We even swam in the last waterfall which was exhilarating. My children all enjoyed it...and even the eldest broke his shell. They took the horses back I took the 4x4....lunch was generous and tasty and the views incredible.... we all really enjoyed it. Recommended. We saw beautiful morpho butterflies and an armadillo.

In the evening we ate at Taco Taco... the food is super super tasty... and a refreshing change from rice and beans. Slightly more expensive than 3Rs but a fun restaurant.

Day 3. We headed to The Original Canopy Tour for a zipline experience. Stopping at the figus tree (amazing and free). We all did the tour.... my daughter zipped mostly on her own and sometimes with the guide. She was incredibly brave. The most scary part was standing on the platforms waiting and the climb up the ladder (me and my daughter did not do this). I admit it was a bit too much for me... adrenaline and fear wise... but we did it and the kids LOVED it. It's the cheapest zipline option I've found and seriously it was enough adrenaline especially with the tartan swing!

Weather has been fine... some heavier rain in the afternoon but mostly after we have finished activities. We did need a jumper in the evening. We are coming from UK so are making the most of our jetlag  and getting up early!

Next stop samara.

Luckily, these dragons are large, and have thick scales, so anything that could cause problems wouldn't get very far.
Their meat is rather tough, due to a lack of variety in their diets. That's why, similar to Hivewings, you want to slowly cook them over low heat, preferably in a decent amount of water. Their metabolism is very slow, which means there is a large amount of fat in places like he neck, and tail. The slow cook makes the meat much softer and less tough.
My personal to list of spices includes:
Paprika
Cinnamon
Garlic powder
Pepper
And ground up coffee beans

I also like to add spicy sauces, it works wonders with the tanginess.

Make sure to add the spices, as well as salt, before boiling in water.

1mcvqqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AWDTSGisToxic/comments/1mcvqqn/cybersecurity_guidance_on_breached_tea_data/,Cybersecurity Guidance on Breached Tea Data,"Just some important feedback from a cybersecurity perspective to help everyone out and keep people safe. There will be DFIR (digital forensic and incident response) engagements on going in support of the lawsuits.

1.) If you're downloading the breached data, cover your tracks. Use Tor, with a VPN, and private DNS if you can. Use public WiFi from a coffee shop, even better. Tor exit nodes can sometimes be compromised giving visibility to your public IP. 

2) Hopefully, whomever initially pulled the data from the Firebase buckets took a forensic, read only, hash of the original version. This is necessary to be admissable in court.

3) Be cautious that you are in possession of data that was already being ILLEGALLY held by the Tea App, then illegally taken. This is considered ""vigilante hacking"" and still a crime. Many of the images violate DMCA copyright laws and also sounds like revenge porn shared in the women's messages. The Tea App WAS ALREADY DISTRIBUTING AND HOSTING ILLEGAL DATA, the breached downloads are technically illegal too.

4) Unfortunately, using ""hacked data"" towards criminal charges or court cases faces heavy scrutiny since the chain of custody has been broken. It's extremely difficult to prove that the data hasn't been tampered with. Even with ethical motives the data can be thrown out as evidence without a forensic image and chain of custody.

HOWEVER, the breached data could potentially be used to justify a criminal investigation from law enforcement into the Tea App and obtain official forensic images by warrant to support any court hearing. If they try to delete data to cover their tracks, they'll get into even more trouble.

5) Whistleblowers or journalists may receive a copy of the hacked data and use it so long as they did not participate in the actual breach and it's in the public interest. This is a legal gray area.

6) If you find that screenshots of your personal dating profiles have been used on the platform file a DMCA take down notice. The Tea App is legally required to respond within a set amount of time. There are instructions pinned here in the sub. There is also an App created by a law firm called Quick DMCA that will file takedown notices for you. The app costs $4.99. Disclaimer: I have not used the app before, but it's backed by a law firm who handles copyright law.

Overrun the shit out of Tea with DMCA notices. They are required to respond within 10-14 days. Affected men have the opportunity to bury them legally and financially right now.

These two breaches are going to generate massive civil and criminal concerns at both a class action and individual case level. Class action for women due to data privacy negligence and individual criminal and civil charges from men towards women who have harmed them. Hopefully, there will be a class action lawsuit representing men too. That part could come forward later after investigation is started on the breach itself and the illegal content ""legally discovered"".

In all. Be smart with the data and cautious about how you share it. Remain anonymous the best you can. I know the majority is trying to do what's morally right and hold the Tea members accountable for their behavior. We need to be pressuring hard for equal justice in every way we can. No more being harassed, stalked, threatened, slandered, defamed and then just ignored because we are men. 

Be safe and godspeed gents. ",3,1753845143.0,AWDTSGisToxic,0,1.0,False

The best water bottles for keeping water cold typically incorporate features designed to minimize heat transfer and maintain the water's temperature for as long as possible. These features include double-wall vacuum insulation, high-quality materials, and airtight seals.

**Double-Wall Vacuum Insulation:** Double-wall vacuum insulation creates a barrier between the inner and outer walls of the bottle, minimizing heat transfer through conduction and convection. A vacuum space between the walls significantly reduces the rate at which the water inside heats up due to external temperatures, allowing it to stay cold for hours, or even days, depending on the ambient conditions and the quality of the insulation.

**High-Quality Materials:** Most top-tier water bottles are constructed from 18/8 food-grade stainless steel, known for its durability, resistance to rust and corrosion, and lack of flavor retention. Stainless steel is also non-toxic and doesn't leach harmful chemicals into the water, ensuring that your drink remains pure and safe. Alternative materials like Tritan plastic might potentially be BPA-free and lighter, but generally don't offer the same level of insulation as stainless steel.

**Airtight Seals:** An airtight seal is crucial for preventing leaks and maintaining the temperature of the water inside. Bottles with secure, leak-proof lids not only prevent spills but also help to minimize air exchange, further reducing heat transfer. Often, the lid construction involves multiple layers of silicone or rubber gaskets to create a tight, reliable closure.

**Wide-Mouth Opening:** A wide-mouth opening facilitates easy filling,cleaning,and adding ice cubes. The larger opening allows you to quickly replenish your water supply and easily scrub the inside of the bottle to maintain hygiene. Some bottles also offer narrower spouts or integrated straws for convenient drinking.

**Powder Coating:** A durable powder coating on the exterior of the bottle provides a comfortable grip and protects it from scratches and dents. This coating also adds an extra layer of insulation, further minimizing heat transfer.The texture of the powder coating can improve the overall user experience by making the bottle easier to handle, notably in wet or humid conditions.

Key features of the best water bottles to keep water cold include:

*   Double-wall vacuum insulation
*   18/8 food-grade stainless steel construction
*   Leak-proof, airtight seals
*   Wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning
*   Durable powder coating for enhanced grip and protection

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have specific questions about the functionality, maintenance, and compatibility of water bottles designed to keep water cold. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.

**How long will the water stay cold in these bottles?**
The duration that water stays cold depends on various factors, including the ambient temperature, the initial temperature of the water, and the quality of the bottle's insulation. Though, most high-quality, double-wall vacuum insulated bottles can keep water cold for 12-24 hours, and some can even maintain ice for up to 48 hours. Factors like repeatedly opening the bottle or leaving it in direct sunlight will reduce the duration of cold retention.

**Are these water bottles dishwasher safe?**
While some water bottles are advertised as dishwasher safe, it is generally recommended to hand wash stainless steel bottles to preserve their insulation and finish. High temperatures and harsh detergents in dishwashers can potentially damage the vacuum seal or affect the coating. The lids are often dishwasher safe, but always check the manufacturer's instructions.

**Can these water bottles be used for hot beverages?**
Yes,most double-wall vacuum insulated water bottles are also capable of keeping hot beverages hot for extended periods. The same insulation technology that keeps cold liquids cold also works to retain heat. Typical hot retention is around 6-12 hours, depending on the same factors influencing cold retention. However, be cautious when using hot beverages, as the bottle's exterior will remain cool to the touch despite the contents being hot.**how do I clean these water bottles effectively?**
To clean these bottles effectively, use warm, soapy water and a bottle brush to scrub the interior. Baking soda can be added to the water to help remove any stubborn stains or odors. For the lid, disassemble any removable parts and wash them thoroughly with soap and water. Allow all components to dry fully before reassembling. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads,as they can scratch the stainless steel or damage the coating.

But when a fourth Titan awakens ‚Äî Medusa ‚Äî the world‚Äôs fragile balance is shattered.  
Now, love, lineage, and war collide.

**Prologue ‚Äì The Second Dawn**

¬†

The sea was calm. Too calm, some would later say.

¬†

A rusting trawler drifted across the open Atlantic, sunlight glinting off its hull. The fishermen aboard moved with the relaxed rhythm of routine ‚Äî laughter, shouted instructions, the splash of bait fish hitting the waves. It could‚Äôve been any summer morning on any quiet ocean.

¬†

But there were no rods. No lines. No reels.

¬†

Above the boat, circling the air like hawks, flew five winged figures ‚Äî lean, humanoid silhouettes backlit by the sun. Their wings stretched wide and powerful, feathers tipped in iridescent metal. From a distance, they could be mistaken for birds. Up close, they were unmistakably human ‚Äî or something close to it.

¬†

The crew called them Solborn. Children of sky and storm. Hunters reborn from a war the world had tried to forget.

¬†

One of the Solborn gave a sharp whistle and pointed to a rippling patch in the water ‚Äî shadows, shifting fast beneath the surface.

‚ÄúBluefin!‚Äù someone yelled.

¬†

The closest Solborn tucked his wings and dove, a silver net unfolding from his arms like a blooming flower. He vanished into the sea with a thundercrack, sending spray skyward. Moments later, he exploded back out, dragging a thrashing bluefin nearly half his size.

¬†

Cheers erupted from the deck.

‚ÄúGood catch!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs three today!‚Äù

‚ÄúFor once, the sea‚Äôs kind.‚Äù

¬†

They shouldn‚Äôt have said that.

¬†

The first tremor was gentle ‚Äî a subtle pulse beneath their boots.

¬†

The second came harder. The water shifted strangely. Not a wave. A pull.

¬†

The fish vanished. Just‚Ä¶ scattered. Gone, like smoke on the wind.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù muttered the old man at the bow. His hands clenched the rail. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a current.‚Äù

¬†

The surface began to swell. Not rise ‚Äî swell, like something beneath it was breathing. A spiral formed, slow at first, then widening faster than the eye could track. Waves churned outward in every direction, but the center kept pulling down, down, down.

¬†

Then the sea broke open.

¬†

The water didn‚Äôt just swirl ‚Äî it collapsed. The ocean floor gave way with a sound like a planet cracking. The whirlpool widened, and widened still, until the trawler was a mere speck inside its mouth.

¬†

They could no longer see the horizon.

¬†

Everywhere they looked ‚Äî east, west, bow, stern ‚Äî was nothing but darkness. The entire world had turned into a spinning void. It swallowed the light, the sky, the sea itself. A monstrous vortex where gravity failed and reason collapsed.

¬†

The boat began to sink.

¬†

Not violently ‚Äî but inevitably. Slowly. Gracefully. Like a stone swallowed by the stars.

¬†

The engine screamed in reverse, but the hull didn‚Äôt lurch. It simply drifted downward, slipping beneath the surface without a splash. Every sound grew muted. Every breath felt thinner.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the sea?‚Äù someone whispered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still here,‚Äù another murmured, voice trembling. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just not in it anymore.‚Äù

¬†

Time stretched. The deck tilted forward by degrees. The sky faded to a ring of light above. Then even that disappeared.

¬†

And rising with them, from that unnatural abyss, came something worse.

¬†

It rose slow, deliberate, like it had waited to be seen.

¬†

It was a god cast in flesh and shadow.

¬†

A hulking mass of muscle and dark-purple scale, its body sculpted with grotesque perfection ‚Äî a colossal barrel chest heaving with unnatural rhythm, arms so massive they dwarfed its own torso, each ending in claws that looked forged for extinction. Its waist tapered into a narrower core, only to explode again into titanic, corded legs thick enough to anchor a mountain.

¬†

Its shoulders jutted upward into sharp, armor-like points, like a crown of blades. There was no neck ‚Äî only an empty collar of bone and obsidian flesh, from which a formless head emerged like flowing smoke. No mouth. No face. Just a pair of burning eyes ‚Äî yellow rimmed in red ‚Äî that pierced the dark like judgment itself.

¬†

Its wings spread behind it, silent and endless, casting a shadow large enough to drown a city block. It did not speak. It did not roar. It simply was ‚Äî a being that unmade meaning by standing still.

¬†

It shrieked ‚Äî high and sharp, like a blade dragged across a dying world.

¬†

The trawler crumbled in its grip, reduced to shrapnel in a heartbeat. Men died without even time to scream. Flocks of Solborn fled in every direction, breaking formation, wings scattering light like torn banners in retreat.

¬†

The beast turned skyward, sensing more.

¬†

Miles away, underground, the walls of Deepwell Outpost Theta pulsed red.

¬†

A young analyst stared at the readings on her console, sweat rolling down her neck.

¬†

\[ANOMALY: CODE BLACK\]

¬†\[SIGNATURE MATCH: DRACONIAN. CLASS: UNKNOWN.\]

¬†\[SEISMIC RADIUS: 2700 KM. ESTIMATED MASS: >400,000 TONS.\]

¬†\[GATE STRUCTURE: FAILING.\]

¬†\[THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\]

¬†

She didn‚Äôt hesitate to press the call button.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù she said into the receiver, her voice brittle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs begun.‚Äù

¬†

The man on the other end ‚Äî a commander in an unmarked chamber lined with relics from a dozen wars ‚Äî took a slow breath.

¬†

Then he opened three channels at once.

‚ÄúUNEX Federation. Code Black. Full mobilization.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúDeepwell Foundation. Initiate Omega Directive.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúEcclesia Callei. Notify the Choir. Light the signal.‚Äù

¬†

A long silence followed.

¬†

Then, almost to himself: ‚ÄúWe were never going to stop it. Only survive the first wave.‚Äù

¬†

Above the Atlantic, the first Draconian spread its wings wide and cast its shadow across the waters of Earth.

¬†

The war for humanity‚Äôs survival had begun.

¬†

And the sky was no longer safe.

¬†

**Chapter 1 ‚Äì Jinhai**

¬†

The city never really sleeps anymore. Not since the Blooming, the event that changed the world forever.  
¬†  
From up here ‚Äî perched on the edge of a hollowed-out high-rise near the East River ‚Äî I can see the whole skeleton of the Brooklyn Bridge stretching across the water. Its spine is cracked, metal ribs exposed like the broken bones of some ancient beast. They‚Äôve been trying to mend it for months now.  
¬†  
But there are no cranes. No scaffolding. No roaring machines.  
¬†  
Only wings.  
¬†  
Solborn construction workers soar between the broken struts, each one unique ‚Äî some feathered, some leathery, others veined like glass. A woman with fiery red pinions lifts a steel beam like it‚Äôs made of cardboard. A man with crow-black wings hovers beside her, holding a fusion torch in one hand and sipping coffee with the other.  
¬†  
Below them, more walk on the bridge itself ‚Äî massive figures with talons instead of boots, hoisting reinforced pillars and snapping them into place with their bare hands. The air is filled with the rhythmic hum of wingbeats and the occasional laughter echoing between towers.  
¬†  
Above, the sky lanes glow with flowing traffic ‚Äî suspended roads for flying cars, some autonomous, others piloted by humans and Solborn alike. A flock of teenagers zoom past in a trail of laughter. One of them carries a girl on his back ‚Äî a human, judging by the way she clutches his neck and grins like the wind could carry her worries away.  
¬†  
It‚Äôs almost beautiful. Almost normal.  
¬†  
But I know better.  
¬†  
My wrist buzzes.  
¬†  
I tap the interface, and with a mellow chime, the projection comes to life. My master, Orin Thal‚Äôs face appears ‚Äî calm, timeless, his expression as unreadable as always. He looks more like a monk than the most powerful man in the Deepwell Foundation. Robes loose at the collar, a faint glow in his eyes. Not the alien Filial soul energy ‚Äî something older. Centered.  
¬†  
¬†He skips any greeting, but not out of coldness. Just urgency.  
‚ÄùThere‚Äôs been a disturbance,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúLower Manhattan. A city block is... unraveling. The Filial bonds that have merged with humans there are failing. We‚Äôre seeing soul separation. Collapse.‚Äù  
¬†  
I frown. That shouldn‚Äôt be possible.  
¬†  
He watches me for a moment before continuing. ‚ÄúThe United Nations for Extraterrestrial Defense (UNEX) is calling it contamination. The Filial worshiping celestial church Ecclesia Calie calls it corruption. Both are guessing.‚Äù  
¬†  
He leans forward slightly. His voice lowers.  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe this is illness, Jinhai. Not in any way the body understands it. This feels‚Ä¶ off-pattern. Like something deeper is being disturbed.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†I don‚Äôt speak. He doesn‚Äôt expect me to.  
¬†‚ÄúThe Church wants to purge it. UNEX wants to seal it. But both are using hammers to fix broken glass.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†His gaze sharpens.  
¬†‚ÄúGo. See it with your own eyes. Help them, if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed. But don‚Äôt assume they know what they‚Äôre dealing with. I need your judgment, not theirs.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†Then, warmer:  
¬†‚ÄúAnd Jinhai‚Ä¶ listen carefully. Sometimes the silence speaks louder than the noise.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†The projection fades.  
¬†  
¬†I close the holo, and for a moment I just breathe‚Äîwatching the world as it glides around me.  
¬†  
¬†My armor adjusts slightly, molding tighter across my shoulders. Matte black from collar to boot, threaded with silent filaments of light. Diamond-shaped orbs pulse on my arms and legs, quiet but alive. The one at my chest glows brightest‚Äîcross-shaped, slow and steady, like a heartbeat.  
¬†  
¬†Two black scapulars hang between my legs‚Äîlightweight, ceremonial, and unnecessary. But I wear them anyway. A reminder of who I serve. Of what I was made to protect.  
¬†  
¬†My wings unfurl behind me with a hushed ripple of energy. Feathers white as moonlight, haloed in a faint, shifting blue. They glow when I focus. When I breathe with intention.  
¬†  
¬†People down there look up when they see me. I know the look.  
¬†  
¬†Awe. Curiosity. Sometimes fear.  
¬†  
¬†But mostly‚Ä¶ recognition.  
¬†  
¬†Because I‚Äôm not just another Solborn. Not to them. Not to Deepwell.  
¬†  
¬†I was born before the treaties. Before the world agreed to coexist with the sky.  
¬†  
¬†Before anyone knew what I was.  
¬†  
¬†I stepped to the edge of the rooftop, boots grinding softly against scorched ferrocrete. The wind tugged at the loose strands of white hair that forever refused to stay slicked back. I exhaled slowly, centering myself. In the fading twilight, I lingered a moment, watching the sun slip behind the old bridge ‚Äî a final breath of beauty before the storm. It reminded me why I fought.  
¬†  
¬†Then‚ÄîI spread my wings.  
¬†  
They unfurled with a whisper of frictionless air, white as frost, each feather laced with threads of energy humming at the edge of vision. A pale blue glow gathered around them, pulsating quietly. The light grew brighter‚Ä¶ hotter‚Ä¶ until flame replaced form. My wings burned‚Äîblue fire wreathed in silence, devouring no oxygen, emitting no smoke. They weren‚Äôt just appendages. They were memory. Inheritance. Bond.  
¬†  
¬†I leaned forward‚Äîand fell.  
¬†  
¬†No flap. No thrust. Just motion.  
¬†  
¬†The wind parted around me like reverence.  
¬†  
Above the city, suspended between history and heaven, a holographic interface shimmered to life across my forearm. Golden grids spun into focus, mapping Manhattan‚Äôs sprawl in clean layers. Red blotches throbbed on the lower east side. A glitch? No. The anomaly had grown again. I swiped left; new readings populated the air, tracking soul frequency destabilization across five blocks.  
¬†  
¬†I narrowed my eyes. ‚ÄúToo fast,‚Äù I muttered.  
¬†  
¬†As I banked westward, the southern skyline drew into view‚Äîand with it, the impossible.  
¬†  
There, off the shore, piercing the clouds like the hand of a god, stood the Helix Basilica‚ÄîEcclesia Callei‚Äôs celestial fortress. It spiraled into the sky in golden coils, its light like amber fire in the mist. Larger than any Earth-born structure, the Basilica was part temple, part control tower, part message to the stars.  
¬†  
¬†I hated it.  
¬†  
Fifteen years ago, I thought, that spiral rose from the sea like a weed through stone. Not to worship‚Ä¶ but to watch. To judge.  
¬†  
Built to monitor the Mawline Rift‚Äîa vast gravitational scar 300 miles southeast of Manhattan where the Ark tore open the Earth‚Äôs crust‚Äîthe Basilica served as Ecclesia‚Äôs sanctum and surveillance tower. They called it a safeguard.  
¬†  
¬†I called it a cage.  
¬†  
¬†I veered away from its golden glow, letting the city fill my vision.  
¬†  
¬†New York. Once steel and soot, now a fractured cathedral of contrasts. Stone towers from centuries past jutted between smooth-filament skyscrapers woven from Filial alloy. Holograms danced on broken facades. Solar sails clung to domes that still bore the scars of the last Draconian siege. Some structures hadn‚Äôt been repaired‚Äîintentionally. Memorials, perhaps. Or warnings.  
¬†  
¬†A shadow moved below.  
¬†  
¬†I slowed my pace.  
¬†  
¬†Two Solborn teens zipped between buildings, their wings barely mature‚Äîflickering like candlelight. One banked too sharply and clipped a rusted lamppost with a loud clang. The boy spun wildly before catching himself, laughter echoing in the morning air.  
¬†  
¬†I smiled faintly.  
¬†  
¬†Still learning. Still crashing. At least they‚Äôre not afraid to fly.  
¬†  
¬†For a moment, I hovered‚Äîjust above the clouds, watching my city. It was bruised but breathing. Beautiful and broken.  
¬†  
¬†The HUD pinged again.  
¬†  
¬†One block pulsed red-hot.  
¬†  
¬†I turned toward it‚Äîeyes narrowing, wings flaring silently‚Äîand descended.  
¬†  
¬†I descended in a slow spiral, the blue fire of my wings dimming as he neared the rooftops. The wind carried with it the buzz of power generators, the low rumble of news drones, and the crackle of tension. The block below had been cordoned off in a tight perimeter‚ÄîUNEX barricades projecting hardlight fences, shimmering with flickers of static as civilians pressed too close.  
¬†  
A crowd had gathered. Solborns and humans alike stood shoulder-to-shoulder behind the glowing lines, faces turned upward. They had that look‚Äîthe uneasy curiosity of those who had seen too much in their lifetime, yet knew enough to worry when the unexpected showed up.  
¬†  
¬†A familiar chorus rang out:  
¬†‚ÄúIs that Deepwell?‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a Deepwell suit!‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúOh god‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt come unless‚Äî‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúNo way‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs Jinhai Rush.‚Äù  
¬†  
I touched down silently, boots hissing as kinetic force dispersed through the landing matrix embedded in my soles. My wings extinguished into wisps of smoke and light, leaving only the shadow-slick plating of the Deepwell Foundation suit behind‚Äîsmooth armor etched with diamond-shaped orbs that pulsed once, then dimmed.  
¬†  
¬†All at once, the murmuring shifted to panic.  
¬†‚ÄúThey sent him?‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúIs it a Draconian breach?‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúSomeone check the Rift monitors‚Äî!‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúNo, no‚Äîthis is local. Deepwell doesn‚Äôt move unless it‚Äôs internal.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†Camera lenses pivoted like a hundred eyes snapping into focus. Holo-reporters hovered into range, voice filters engaging with seamless clarity.  
¬†‚ÄúBreaking now‚ÄîDeepwell Foundation has officially deployed a field operative to the anomaly site in Lower Manhattan. Sources on-site confirm visual ID of Jinhai Rush, high-ranking Deepwell agent and survivor of the second dawn.‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúThe last time Deepwell sent someone this high-profile into the field, it was during the Coney Island invasion.‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúUNEX and Ecclesia forces remain unresponsive to our requests for clarification.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†That last line rang truer than expected.  
¬†  
¬†A ripple of movement tore through the ranks of UNEX soldiers near the perimeter checkpoint. Their armor‚Äîsleek, urban-issue exo suits painted in neutral greys‚Äîparted to reveal a man stomping forward. A captain, by the crimson stripe on his chestplate and the badge flickering at his collar. His eyes locked on Jinhai like a missile.  
¬†‚ÄúKnew it,‚Äù the captain muttered as he approached. ‚ÄúNo comms. No clearance. No chain of command. Just drop out of the sky like a damn omen.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†He stopped just outside of Jinhai‚Äôs personal radius, jaw tight, hands on his hips.  
¬†‚ÄúYou want to tell me why Deepwell suddenly cares about a containment op we‚Äôve had locked down for six hours?‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†I tilted my head slightly. ‚ÄúLooks like the panic started before I arrived.‚Äù  
¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get clever,‚Äù the captain snapped. ‚ÄúUNEX has jurisdiction. Ecclesia sanctified the perimeter. If this was a joint op, you‚Äôre late‚Äîand if it‚Äôs not, you‚Äôre trespassing.‚Äù  
¬†  
My gaze remained cool. ‚ÄúThere are fluctuations in the anomaly readings your field scans aren‚Äôt picking up. Filial destabilization isn‚Äôt just spiritual‚Äîit‚Äôs structural. I‚Äôm not here to step on your chain of command, Captain. I‚Äôm here because this isn‚Äôt containment. It‚Äôs collapse.‚Äù  
¬†  
The captain‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but something flickered behind his eyes.  
¬†  
¬†He exhaled through his nose, tapped his comm-link, and turned away. ‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs collapse,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always collapse when Deepwell shows up.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†Above them, a news anchor‚Äôs voice echoed from a public holo-feed:  
¬†‚ÄúFor those just tuning in, tensions continue to rise as Deepwell agent Jinhai Rush appears on-site. The uneasy alliance between the three major forces‚ÄîUNEX, Ecclesia Callei, and the Deepwell Foundation‚Äîhas long been a point of public speculation. Deepwell, often criticized for its isolationism and lack of transparency, rarely intervenes outside Rift-adjacent anomalies.‚Äù  
¬†  
¬†A second anchor added, ‚ÄúUNEX officers on the ground seem unaware of the Foundation‚Äôs presence prior to the arrival, suggesting a possible breach in protocol‚Ä¶ or something bigger than anyone expected.‚Äù  
¬†  
I walked past the line of soldiers, eyes scanning the flickering readouts from my wrist. The anomaly was near‚Äîclose enough that the air had begun to vibrate.  
¬†  
The street ahead was cracked, buildings leaning at odd angles, and something deeper‚Ä¶ darker‚Ä¶ pulsed beneath the asphalt.  
¬†  
¬†Whatever was happening here, it wasn‚Äôt just soul decay.  
¬†  
¬†It was something new.  
¬†  
Something wrong.  
¬†  
The captain‚Äôs voice returned a moment later, tight with forced neutrality. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been greenlit. Higher-ups say it came from Orin Thal himself. So fine‚Äîgo play your part.‚Äù  
¬†  
He didn‚Äôt wait for a response, already walking away. Probably to report back that Deepwell was stepping into his jurisdiction again.  
¬†  
Jinhai watched him leave, then slowly turned back toward the hot zone.  
¬†  
The UNEX soldiers standing guard didn‚Äôt meet my eyes. Their faces were hidden behind standard-issue helmets, visors glowing faintly red. Their armor looked pristine‚Äîretooled just this year, judging by the humming resonance packs on their spines and the tri-channel capacitors on their arms.  
¬†  
¬†All of it powered by Filial converters‚Äîtechnology lifted from Deepwell archives, repurposed, weaponized.  
¬†  
¬†Leeches, I thought.  
¬†  
There was no reverence in their use of it. No understanding of what it meant to channel the Filial soul energy. Deepwell spent years learning to listen to those wavelengths‚Äîharmonize with them. To form bonds, not shackles. The entire purpose of a Filial entity was unity: merging, trust, resonance.  
¬†  
¬†UNEX didn‚Äôt care.  
¬†  
¬†They didn‚Äôt want harmony. They wanted horsepower.  
¬†  
To them, a Filial soul is just a high-output battery, I thought bitterly. Another piece of equipment to slot into a weapon system or body mod. It is a gift, not a tool.¬†  
And they called it protection.  
¬†  
Deepwell had spent decades studying both Filials and Draconians‚Äînot just to fight, but to understand. Every artifact, every anomaly, every battle-scarred ruin was a lesson. Their goal wasn‚Äôt domination. It was preservation. Humanity didn‚Äôt need another conqueror. It needed a memory. A conscience.  
¬†  
¬†UNEX was the opposite. All iron and ego. They dressed up control as security and called it righteous.  
¬†  
¬†They build walls and prisons. We build questions and answers.  
¬†  
¬†And here they were‚Äîstanding on the same battlefield, watching the same sickness spread beneath their feet.  
¬†  
¬†It made my skin crawl.  
¬†  
I exhaled slowly, reaching up to brush my fingers across the diamond-shaped node embedded in my collar.  
¬†  
¬†A low hum answered. The orb pulsed once.  
¬†‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what you‚Äôre hiding,‚Äù I whispered to the city.  
¬†  
¬†And with that, I stepped deeper into the infected zone.  
¬†  
As I stepped inside, the hairs on the back of my neck rose instinctively. Everything felt off. I sensed it ‚Äî the energy had turned, sharp and unnatural.  
¬†  
The lights were out. Darkness swallowed everything. The cross-shaped orb at the center of my chest began to glow, casting a narrow beam of light as I moved down the corridor.""  
¬†  
I reached the lobby‚Äîand froze.  
¬†  
Dozens of Solborns lay scattered across the floor, bodies suspended mid-motion. Each face locked in agony, mouths open, eyes wide, but unmoving. Attempts to touch them were repelled by an invisible forcefield. A faint field extended from each body, warping the space around them, bending light to form ghost-like afterimages‚Äîoutlines of their limbs and expressions, disjointed in time.  
¬†  
I tapped at the omnitool on my wrist‚Äîproprietary Deepwell tech.  
¬†  
¬†Static.  
¬†  
¬†Interference.  
¬†  
¬†I crouched and gathered dust from a cracked tile, then blew it gently into the air.  
¬†  
Instead of drifting naturally, it split into rectangular streaks, pulling downward in clean vertical channels. Not atmospheric. Not spiritual.  
¬†  
A gravitational field.  
¬†  
This wasn‚Äôt a disease.  
¬†  
I stood. My Eyes closed. I pressed my index and middle finger to my temple.  
¬†  
The orbs on my armor flared to life, glowing brighter and brighter. My body filled with power.  
With energy.  
We called it Filial Resonance.  
Energy pulsed outward in waves ‚Äî from my core, through my suit, and into the earth itself. I reached into the Resonance, attuning to the subtle vibrations woven beneath the physical world.  
¬†  
In my mind‚Äôs eye, the city block unfolded in layered clarity ‚Äî buildings, structural voids, heat signatures, soul echoes.  
I found them. The victims.  
¬†  
¬†Then‚Äîsomething else.  
¬†  
¬†Far below the building, a hollow space. Two hundred feet down. A gravitational sink, tugging at every thread of Filial energy in the vicinity ‚Äî draining it.  
¬†  
¬†Feeding on it.  
¬†  
¬†An underground world, hidden in the dark. Alive.  
¬†  
¬†But first‚Äîthe survivors.  
¬†  
I increased the frequency of the energy pulses ‚Äî gently, precisely. Then, with a subtle shift, I reversed the downward flow, redirecting it outward. A barrier formed beneath my feet, blocking the anomaly‚Äôs pull like a dam against a draining tide.  
¬†  
Only then did I turn my attention to the victims.  
¬†  
Their Filial resonance had unraveled ‚Äî severed from their core frequency. Of course. That was it. The Filial soul energy, once harmonized with the body, had become desynchronized. Unanchored, it hovered just out of reach, leaving the body in stasis ‚Äî hollow and fading.  
¬†  
Without that resonance, the body would fail. The soul would fracture.  
¬†  
I exhaled slowly and focused.  
¬†

Like a careful stitchworker threading a torn seam, I began to mend the connection ‚Äî aligning the threads of Filial and human essence one by one. My hands moved in measured gestures, sending pulses of calming wavelength across the ruptured field. The glow of my chest orb softened. Resonance returned, gentle and warm.  
¬†  
¬†And then ‚Äî breath.  
¬†  
The effect was immediate.  
¬†  
The victims gasped as the light-warped afterimages snapped back into place, merging with flesh and bone.  
¬†  
Some coughed. Others groaned. Eyes fluttered open, dazed and searching.  
¬†  
One by one, they returned. Confused, but alive.  
‚ÄúGo,‚Äù I said, my voice steady. ‚ÄúNow. While you still can.‚Äù  
They rose shakily, dazed but moving. A few murmured thanks before fleeing toward the exits.  
¬†  
Outside, the media caught the chaos on live broadcast. Reporters scrambled to confirm that the victims had been ‚Äúcured.‚Äù  
¬†  
But Ecclesia Callei priests were already closing in‚Äîdemanding the victims be quarantined for questioning. Golden-robed enforcers blocked the path, holding firm with practiced resolve.  
¬†  
The crowd turned ugly.  
¬†  
Shouts erupted.  
¬†  
Bottles and scraps of debris flew.  
¬†  
The Ecclesian priests didn‚Äôt flinch.  
¬†  
They raised their arms in tandem, golden robes billowing with divine authority. Each one glowed with a yellow aura, but the higher-ranking priests stood apart‚Äîwhite halos of radiant light arched behind their backs like glowing rings, framing their heads in sanctified brilliance.  
¬†  
One of the lesser priests unfurled a ceremonial lasso‚Äîthreaded with radiant cords‚Äîand cast it into the crowd. It snapped around a protester‚Äôs waist.  
‚ÄúRehabilitation is required,‚Äù the priest declared.  
¬†  
Gasps.  
¬†  
Silence.  
¬†

The rest of the crowd fell quiet, shrinking back in fear.  
¬†  
Inside the building, I stepped toward the center of the floor and let his wings blaze back to life‚Äîblue flames erupting into shape. I raised my right arm. The flame of my right wing coalesced, twisting inward and wrapping around my forearm like a living helix of plasma.  
¬†  
It became a drill.  
¬†  
An energy-formed, flame-wreathed weapon forged from will and soul.  
¬†  
I found the weakest point in the floor and slammed downward.  
¬†  
Stone cracked. Steel screamed. Dust erupted.  
¬†  
I drilled through what seemed like ten stories, then through concrete, then soil. Then two-hundred feet down, I stopped, nothing was there to drill ‚ÄîI hovered in the void.  
¬†  
¬†An underground cavern yawned before me.  
¬†  
¬†Empty.  
¬†  
¬†Except for the eggs.  
¬†  
Dozens‚Äîmaybe thousands‚Äîof black-scaled, barrel-sized eggs lined the floor in uneven rows. Each one shimmered faintly in the dark, the membranes pulsing in tune with something ancient and hostile.  
¬†  
¬†It was a nest.  
¬†  
¬†And it wasn‚Äôt abandoned.  
¬†  
¬†Behind me, a hiss.  
¬†  
¬†I turned‚Äîand locked eyes with death.  
¬†  
Twin red eyes burned in a plume of black smoke, coalescing into sinew, claws, and wings.The beast emerged slowly into the narrow beam of my armor‚Äôs light ‚Äî twenty feet tall, all jagged limbs and leathery wings, its scales were so black they swallowed the light itself.  
¬†  
Its body shimmered between flesh and smoke, wings half-formed, spine jagged. Its black-scaled hide absorbed every trace of light, giving it the illusion of a living void.  
¬†  
It opened its jaws.  
¬†  
And smiled.

Hi. I‚Äôm Evan (22, TM). This is the first time I‚Äôm posting on Reddit since I got on the app a week ago. I‚Äôm feeling really guilty and confused right now I need some advice/opinions. 

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend, Julian (28M), for 8 months, and he‚Äôs honestly amazing most of the time. I‚Äôm pretty new to serious relationships, and sometimes I worry I‚Äôm not good enough for him. Last night, we had a fight, and I ended up leaving his place to stay with a friend. I feel like I overreacted, but I‚Äôm also kinda hurt, and I need help figuring out if I‚Äôm the asshole here.

So, a bit about us: I‚Äôm a part-time barista and studying graphic design at community college. I‚Äôm still figuring out life as a trans guy, and Julian‚Äôs been super supportive and a loving boyfriend. Sometimes he evens offers to help cover my T costs when I‚Äôm strapped for cash or checking in to make sure I‚Äôm okay. He‚Äôs charming, has a solid marketing job, and he‚Äôs always caring, always planning cute dates or making sure I‚Äôm eating when I‚Äôm stressed out. But sometimes he gets‚Ä¶ overly protective? Like, he‚Äôll ask a ton of questions about who I‚Äôm with, where I‚Äôm going or say things like, ‚ÄúI just want you to be safe/you‚Äôre too trusting.‚Äù At first, I thought it was sweet, but lately, it feels a bit overbearing, like I can‚Äôt move without him needing to know.

Anyway the fight happened two days ago and happened was: I posted an instagram story of me grabbing coffee with my friend Bruno (24M), who‚Äôs also my ex from a couple years ago(we dated briefly for a year ish and now we‚Äôre just friends who catch up sometimes) My insta story was literally just us holding coffee cups and I captioned it ‚Äúcaffeine catch-up.‚Äù which I thought was totally harmless but apparently it wasn‚Äôt. 

Julian saw it and got quiet, which is his thing when he‚Äôs upset and I‚Äôve gotten used to it. Then later, he asked why I didn‚Äôt tell him I was meeting Bruno. I said it was just coffee there was no big deal, but he said it ‚Äúlooks bad‚Äù to post with an ex and that I should‚Äôve checked with him first. He wasn‚Äôt yelling or anything but he was super serious saying stuff like, ‚ÄúI trust you, but you don‚Äôt get how this comes off to other people.‚Äù and then I got defensive because it‚Äôs literally MY instagram and I wasn‚Äôt hiding anything and he had nothing to worry about. 

But things got heated. I told Julian he was overreacting, and he said I was being naive, that posting the story made him feel disrespected. He insisted I take it down and unfollow Bruno‚Äôs account. His voice got loud, almost aggressive, which threw me off, but then he softened and said it‚Äôd ‚Äúmean a lot‚Äù if I did it. I felt so trapped that I unfollowed Bruno(which I totally regret now because I only did it under pressure) but when he kept pushing me to delete the story too, sounding more frustrated, I dug in and said no, I wasn‚Äôt taking it down. I told him we both needed space to cool off, or this fight was just going to spiral. We were both pretty worked up, so I grabbed my backpack and left to crash at my friend Sam‚Äôs place (23F, we met in art class). I didn‚Äôt tell Julian where I was going because I was still kinda pissed and just needed to think. Now I feel so dumb for being so dramatic, but I was just so overwhelmed in the moment.

Now it‚Äôs 3AM I‚Äôve been ignoring his texts but he texted me an apologies saying he didn‚Äôt mean to upset me and that he was just jealous because he cares so much about me. He said he‚Äôs cool with me hanging with Bruno but wishes I‚Äôd be more ‚Äúopen‚Äù about my plans so he doesn‚Äôt feel left out. He even sent a voice note saying he misses me and wants to talk when I‚Äôm ready. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I made a big deal out of nothing‚Ä¶. 

The thing is he is older and has more relationship experience so maybe I was the one being thoughtless?? I still love him of course and he‚Äôs usually so great, but sometimes I feel like he has these barriers that he puts up and he comes off as overprotective. I haven‚Äôt gone back to his place yet, and the story‚Äôs not up anymore because I eventually chose to delete it the more I felt guilty and bad about it. Anyways I‚Äôm so sorry if this is long to read but that‚Äôs all

I feel so bad for making him worry, but I also feel weird about the whole thing idk what to do. Any advice is allowed.

- - - - 

TL;DR: I posted an Instagram story with my ex who I‚Äôm still friends with. My boyfriend got upset, said it looked bad, and asked me to delete the story and unfollow my ex. I felt pressured, unfollowed him, but refused to delete the story. We argued, I left to stay with a friend, and now I‚Äôm feeling guilty and unsure if I overreacted or if his response was controlling.",0,1753844657.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

The next morning, the sun was shining, birds were chirping, and Dipper was half-asleep as he dragged himself into Greasy‚Äôs Diner.

""Remind me again why I'm awake at this ungodly hour?"" Dipper mumbled, rubbing his eyes.

""It‚Äôs noon, dude,"" Wendy said, smirking.

Stan scoffed. ""Back in my day, kids weren‚Äôt a bunch of lazy bums. We woke up at 5 AM, milked the cows, fought off highway bandits, and still made it home in time for breakfast!""

Dipper blinked. ""You grew up in Jersey.""

""Exactly!"" Stan huffed. ""We had Jersey bandits.""

Wendy chuckled as she led them to a booth. Dipper sat down across from Stan, still suspicious.

""Alright, Wendy, you‚Äôve been acting weird all morning. What‚Äôs this ‚Äòbig surprise‚Äô you won‚Äôt tell me about?""

Wendy just smirked. ""Relax, dude. You‚Äôll see soon enough.""

Dipper narrowed his eyes. ""That‚Äôs exactly what people say before they throw you into a pit of snakes.""

""Trust me, it's not snakes. But that would be hilarious,"" Wendy teased.

Dipper groaned, resting his forehead on the table. ""I swear, if this is some kind of prank‚Äî""

Before he could finish, Wendy casually turned to the nearest waitress. ""Hey, bring her in.""

The waitress nodded and walked off. Dipper sat up, confused. ""Wait, who are you bringing in?""

Wendy just smirked. ""You‚Äôll see.""

Dipper looked at Stan for help, but the old man just sipped his coffee. ""Don‚Äôt look at me, kid. I just came for the free refills.""

Dipper sighed, shaking his head. ""Why do I feel like I‚Äôm about to regret this?""

Then, the sound of approaching footsteps made him turn his head‚Äî

‚Äîand he froze.

Standing just a few feet away, looking just as shocked as he was‚Äî

Pacifica Northwest.

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The entire diner seemed to go silent, as if the universe itself was pausing for dramatic effect.

Pacifica‚Äôs eyes widened. ""Dipper?!""

Dipper blinked. ""Pacifica?!""

Stan looked between them, then muttered, ""Welp. This just got interesting.""

Pacifica fidgeted, clearly caught off guard. ""I‚Ä¶ I didn't know you were back in town.""

Dipper rubbed the back of his neck. ""Yeah‚Ä¶ surprise?""

Wendy grinned, leaning back in her seat. ""Mission accomplished. You‚Äôre welcome.""

Dipper shot her a glare. ""Wendy! You planned this?!""

Wendy shrugged. ""Hey, you haven‚Äôt seen each other in, what? Ten years? Figured it was time for a reunion.""

Pacifica huffed. ""I hate that you‚Äôre right.""

Dipper sighed and gestured to the seat across from him. ""Well‚Ä¶ wanna sit down?""

Pacifica hesitated, then sighed. ""Might as well. Not like I can just walk out now."" She sat down, folding her arms. ""So. This is‚Ä¶ weird.""

Dipper chuckled awkwardly. ""Yeah. Very weird.""

Stan, meanwhile, was enjoying the drama way too much. ""Hey, waitress! Bring me extra popcorn!""

""This is a diner, sir. We don‚Äôt serve popcorn.""

""Then bring me some buttered toast and I‚Äôll pretend.""

Wendy snorted. ""Classic.""

Dipper, ignoring them, cleared his throat. ""So, uh‚Ä¶ how‚Äôve you been?""

Pacifica leaned back, tapping her fingers on the table. ""Well, I haven‚Äôt been chased by a demon triangle in the past decade, so I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm doing okay.""

Dipper chuckled. ""Yeah. Low bar, but understandable.""

She smirked. ""What about you? Finally stopped being a paranoid nerd?""

Dipper gasped dramatically. ""EXCUSE ME, I embrace my paranoia! It's what kept me alive in this town!""

Pacifica raised an eyebrow. ""Uh-huh. So what life-threatening conspiracy are you unraveling this time?""

Dipper hesitated. ""‚Ä¶I don't know yet, but I will find one.""

Pacifica shook her head. ""Ten years, and you‚Äôre still the same dork.""

Dipper grinned. ""You know you missed it.""

Pacifica scoffed. ""Pfft. As if."" But the slight smile on her face told a different story.

Stan leaned toward Wendy and whispered, ""Is it just me, or is there chemistry here?""

Wendy smirked. ""Oh, totally. I give ‚Äòem a week before the awkward flirting starts.""

Stan chuckled. ""I give it a day.""

Pacifica suddenly turned to Wendy. ""By the way, why did you set this up?""

Wendy grinned. ""Because it‚Äôs hilarious.""

Pacifica groaned. ""I hate how well you know me.""

Dipper laughed. ""Welcome to my world.""

And just like that, the tension broke. The awkwardness faded into something more comfortable, more familiar.

I started drinking about 80oz per day over an 8 hour period and almost immediately noticed I felt MORE dehydrated and kind of crampy. I added a small amount of electrolytes to my water incase the increased water intake was flushing out my internal electrolytes, but it made no difference.

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn‚Äîit‚Äôs time to dissect this ATP Canadian Open clash between Taylor Fritz and Roberto Carballes Baena. Let‚Äôs start with the numbers because, let‚Äôs be honest, Carballes Baena isn‚Äôt here to win‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs here to make Fritz look like a *very* patient teacher grading a kindergartener‚Äôs algebra homework.

### Parsing the Odds: Fritz is the Human Equivalent of a ‚ÄúFree Two-For-One Coffee‚Äù Coupon

The odds make this as clear as a tennis ball hit into a swimming pool: **Taylor Fritz is the overwhelming favorite**. At BetMGM, Fritz is priced at **+106** (decimal: \~1.06), implying an absurd **\~94% implied probability** of victory. Carballes Baena, meanwhile, sits at **+875** (decimal: \~8.75), suggesting bookmakers give him less of a chance than a snowman in a sauna. Even the spread (-5.5 games for Fritz) and total (Under 19.5 games) suggest a straightforward, low-scoring affair‚Äîthink of it as a tennis match where Fritz is playing against a wall that‚Äôs also napping.

### News Digest: Fritz is Pouty, Carballes Baena is ‚ÄúHere for the Vibe‚Äù

Taylor Fritz, the World No. 4, is coming off a solid run in Melbourne and a semifinal finish at the Citi Open. But let‚Äôs not forget his recent grumbling about the ATP‚Äôs ‚Äúmandatory 500-event attendance policy,‚Äù which forced him to play when he‚Äôd rather be sipping coconut water on a beach. As he said, ‚ÄúI really could have used a rest week.‚Äù Translation: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm a human being, not a Roomba that needs to vacuum every room in the house.‚Äù*

However, 1 month ago I got an aeropress & it's just so amazing. Fits my taste buds properly. I even went so low to grab bags of Dunkin & Black Rifle to grind & it's just been amazing.

Brandon Nakashima enters this match as a near-70% favorite across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around 1.4‚Äì1.45 (implied probability ‚âà 69‚Äì70%). For Ethan Quinn, the underdog, odds sit at roughly 2.8‚Äì2.9 (implied probability ‚âà 34‚Äì35%), meaning the books think he‚Äôs about as likely to win as I am to finally learn how to properly tie a tie. The spread favors Nakashima by -3.5 games, a line that screams ‚ÄúQuinn‚Äôs about to get schooled in a very public, very Canadian way.‚Äù

Historically, Nakashima has already beaten Quinn in straight sets at Washington, a result that feels less like a tennis match and more like a ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your life, Ethan‚Äù moment. Nakashima‚Äôs experience‚Äîread: not crying in the third set‚Äîis a key edge. Quinn, meanwhile, has shown ‚Äúimpressive development this year,‚Äù which is tennis code for ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not terrible, but he‚Äôs not exactly Serena.‚Äù

**Digest the News: Injuries, Progress, and the Burden of Potential**  
No major injuries here, which is a relief. Nakashima‚Äôs game is as steady as a coffee shop in Manhattan‚Äîreliable, if a little overpriced. Quinn‚Äôs ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù this year is the sports equivalent of a sapling: promising, but don‚Äôt bet on it surviving a hurricane.

But does anyone have any other good options, or any tips for deciding on and navigating date spots? I want to make sure I‚Äôm not stressing out during a date about being symptomatic, but I also want him to enjoy himself with me!

We also both live about 1-2 hours from Disney and we‚Äôve talked about going to their downtown/Disney Springs area, which I‚Äôd love, but it‚Äôs crazy hot in Florida right now so I‚Äôm concerned about that.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a clash that‚Äôs less ‚Äúthrilling showdown‚Äù and more ‚Äústatisticians showing off.‚Äù Andrey Rublev, the Russian hard-court wizard, steps onto the court as a near-92% favorite (per decimal odds of 1.09), while Hugo Gaston, the Frenchman who advanced after Mattia Bellucci‚Äôs retirement, is priced at 7.0-8.0‚Äîtranslating to a 12.5%-14.3% chance. If this were a math class, Gaston would be the ‚Äúshow your work‚Äù question, and Rublev would be the answer written in bold.

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Joke**  
Let‚Äôs break it down. Rublev‚Äôs implied probability of winning is so high, it‚Äôs like ordering a 12-ounce coffee and getting a 12-ounce *plus a side of confidence*. At 1.09, bookmakers are basically saying, ‚ÄúBet on Rublev, but we‚Äôll take 4% of your joy as a fee for being reasonable.‚Äù Gaston‚Äôs 8.0 odds, meanwhile, imply he‚Äôs here to make the match ‚Äúsudden death‚Äù in the third set‚Ä¶ of your betting bankroll.

The spread? Rublev is -5.5 games, which is like giving him a 5.5-game head start in a race where the finish line is ‚Äúwinning a tennis match.‚Äù The total games line sits at 19.5, suggesting this could be a tight three-setter‚Äîor a mercy rule if Rublev decides to play like the world No. 12 he is.

For context I (28F) met Ausboy (27M) last 2019 he's a single dad living in Australia. He's always sliding into my DM that year and I always ignore it kasi may jowa sya that time.
Fast forward November 2023 we started casually chatting (nagreply ako kasi bored ako and I know wala syang jowa for 1+ year kasi were FB friends din. Started talking and video chatting nadin. We become close and he also introduced me with his child. Then December came he told me he loves me and things got serious between us (didn't said i love him back) i told him lets take it slow and see where it'll lead us (been single for 7yrs) by 2024 March - June i ghosted him kasi I found out na hes been talking with her Ex and after i confronted him about it naging sad boy sya and will call me in the middle of the night saying ""wag mokong susukuan ah"".

July came and i greeted him a happy birthday and promises me he'll go in the PH just to see me and his family. Ako kasi yung klase ng tao na I will not take you away sa family mo and be happy that you're spending time with them lalo na 5 years na syang hindi umuuwi ng PH. July 31 came and sabi nya sakin otw na sya sa airport and he told me he loves me. After 12 hrs of waiting nakita ko nagstory sya lo and behold kasama nya ex nya and he's in Disneyland. No msgs no nothing just a story of them together. I simply block him everywhere. That's my revenge.

Fast forward to December nagmsg sya using his childs account saying if we could meet up by 2025 kasi uuwi nga sya for a month. 2025 rolled in Ako naman tong tanga nakipagkita. We went to get coffee and talk very casually and point blank ask him bakit nya ginawa sakin yon. Ang sagot ng kupal ""wala kasi akong narinig na plan sayo regarding sa pag uwi ko parang wala kang balak makipagkita sakin"" tf told him my reasons and we went on our separate ways din. 
We're trying to fix things between us and then may nakita ako sa msg request ko a girl named Jan he told me that Ausboy is his boyfriend. Girl i said sorry right away ü•≤ ewan ko but i check naman everywhere and wala talaga akong makita na jowa or nakakausap nya. Even talk to his dad and pinakilala nya akong girlfriend nya kahit hindi pa kami, even sa cousins nya. Then confronted him about her. He told me na nakafling nya yong girl, and the girl became super obsessive to the point na inistalk na sya.
Told the girl about it and things weren't adding up, mind you nabuntis nya si girl and she had a miscarriage üò≠ Became super suspicious about the details he's been telling me. And found out na 5 kaming babae ang nakakausap nya. Ang galing ng time management ni Ausboy. The girl even sends me receipts about who he's been talking to and started making plans in my head. But first I confirmed sa girl when they started dating and she come around the time na MU kami ni Ausboy and she knew about me, but still continue. They broke up around August 2024 (kasi nga kasama nya ex nya sa DL)

Jan and I talk and told her that I am deeply sorry for causing her pain. She told me na lagi daw nila akong pinag aawayan kasi lagi nyang nakikita na inistalk ako ni Ausboy sa dummy account nya. We even became friends tbh. She has a pure heart for him. Felt sad kasi nagsesettle sya for less. Nabubugbog sya dndegrade pagkatao nya ni Ausboy. She sent me screenshots ng mga msgs nila. Naawa ako for her.

So here's my plan, told the girl to act like nothings happen. I will do the same din (like naniniwala ako sa reasonings ni Ausboy)

After work ni girl she went to Ausboy's house and she confronted her about me and naghinala si Ausboy agad kasi nakaearpods si girl(magkacall kami hehe), biglang naputol yung call then after a few minutes nagcall na ulit sya nagchat na ""bi nakatangal airpods ko off ko lang cam and mute ka lang ha"" then boom she asked him ""Be sino si *****"" sabi nung Ausboy ""ano yon msg ng msg sakin"" then bigla akong nag on cam sa FaceTime saying ""ohh talaga ba? Kakasabi mo lang kanina mahal moko bakit ngayon ganyan sinasabi mo?"" Then tawa ako ng tawa (yung tawa na nangnakakainsulto) ayun nabugbog si atekooo üò≠ lalo sya nagalit kasi sumigaw ako ng ""oh wag mo syang sasaktan ha"" naawa ako for her kasi nakita ko pano sya pinagtulakan palabas ng bahay. She went home satisfied but i felt bad talaga kasi naranasan nya yon because of my plan after that I messaged Ausboy ""how does it feel? üòù"" then block him everywhere.

SORRY IF HINDI MAAYOS YUNG EXPLANATION KO

Life's good
Jan and I became friends din.

**Durable Construction:**

A high-quality stainless steel grinder is built to last. the grade of stainless steel used considerably impacts its durability and resistance to wear and tear. Look for grinders made from 304 or 316 stainless steel, known for their exceptional corrosion resistance and strength. This ensures that the grinder can withstand frequent use without succumbing to rust, scratches, or deformation. The thickness of the steel also plays a crucial role, with thicker steel providing better impact resistance and longevity.

**Precision Grinding Mechanism:**

the grinding mechanism is the heart of any grinder. Stainless steel burrs or blades must be precisely machined to deliver consistent and uniform grinding. Burr grinders, in particular, offer superior control over particle size, making them ideal for coffee enthusiasts who demand a specific grind consistency. Look for burrs that are hardened or coated to enhance their durability and sharpness. Equally spaced blades are designed for efficiency and speed.

**Ergonomic Design:**

The grinder should be cozy and easy to use. Ergonomic considerations include the shape and size of the grinder, the texture of the grip, and the smoothness of the grinding action. A well-designed grinder minimizes strain on your hands and wrists, particularly during prolonged use. Consider the ease of disassembling and reassembling the grinder for cleaning purposes. The presence of compartments to make gathering ingredients easier is a bonus.**Adjustable Grind Settings:**

Many stainless steel grinders offer adjustable grind settings, which allows you to customize the coarseness of the grind to suit your specific needs and preferences. This feature is particularly important for coffee grinders, where the grind size can significantly impact the taste and aroma of the beverage. Adjustable settings also make the grinder versatile for processing different types of ingredients, from fine powders to coarse flakes. Precise adjustment increments allow for finer control over the final product.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Stainless steel is relatively easy to clean and maintain, but the grinder's design can affect the ease of this process. Look for grinders with removable parts that can be easily rinsed or washed in the dishwasher. Avoid grinders with intricate crevices or hard-to-reach areas that can trap food particles or debris. Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance and hygiene. Always check manufacturer guidelines for recommended cleaning methods.

## Core Benefits

Stainless steel grinders offer several compelling benefits over grinders made from other materials. These advantages make them a popular choice for both professional and home use.

**Improved Grind Consistency:** The precision-engineered grinding mechanisms in high-quality stainless steel grinders ensure a consistent and uniform grind every time. This is particularly important for coffee and spice grinding, where uniform particle size is essential for optimal flavour extraction. Users report better-tasting coffee and more flavorful spices due to this consistency, enhancing their overall culinary experience. Grind consistency also ensures that no valuable ingredients go to waste.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:** Stainless steel is a highly durable material that can withstand years of use without showing signs of wear and tear.Stainless steel grinders are resistant to rust, corrosion, and staining, ensuring that they remain in excellent condition for an extended period. This translates to long-term cost savings compared to grinders made from cheaper materials that may need to be replaced more frequently. A well-maintained steel grinder will last a long time.

**Simplified Cleaning and Maintenance:** Stainless steel is easy to clean and maintain, making stainless steel grinders a hygienic choice. The smooth, non-porous surface of stainless steel resists the buildup of residue and bacteria, and it can be easily wiped clean with a damp cloth. Many stainless steel grinders also have removable parts that can be washed in the dishwasher, further simplifying the cleaning process. This convenient cleaning minimizes the time consumed on upkeep.

**Chemical inertness:** Unlike some other materials, stainless steel is chemically inert, meaning it won't react with the ingredients being ground. This prevents unwanted flavors or odors from being transferred to the spices,herbs,or coffee beans. Users can be confident that the flavor of their ingredients remains pure and unadulterated. Inert materials ensure safety when using a kitchen tool.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions and concerns to help the buyer.

**Are all stainless steel grinders dishwasher safe?**

Not all stainless steel grinders are dishwasher safe. While many are designed with dishwasher-safe components, it's crucial to consult the manufacturer's instructions before placing any parts in the dishwasher.Some grinders may have delicate parts that could be damaged by the heat and harsh detergents found in dishwashers. Hand washing with mild soap and water is often recommended for optimal longevity.

**How often should I clean my stainless steel grinder?**

The frequency of cleaning depends on how frequently the grinder is used and the types of ingredients being ground.For daily use, it's generally recommended to clean the grinder at least once a week. If used less frequently, cleaning every two to three weeks should suffice. Thoroughly cleaning the grinder after grinding oily or sticky ingredients is especially critically important to prevent residue buildup.**Can stainless steel grinders be used for both coffee and spices?**

While some stainless steel grinders are versatile enough to handle both coffee and spices,it's not always recommended to use the same grinder for both. Coffee beans tend to leave behind oils and residue that can affect the flavor of spices. Similarly, spices can impart their flavors onto coffee beans. If you plan to use the same grinder for both, be sure to thoroughly clean it between uses to minimize flavor transfer.

**What is the difference between blade and burr stainless steel grinders?**

Blade grinders use spinning blades to chop the ingredients, while burr grinders use two abrasive surfaces to grind the ingredients between them. Burr grinders provide more consistent and uniform grinding, allowing for better control over particle size. Blade grinders, on the other hand, tend to produce inconsistent results with a mixture of fine and coarse particles.Burr grinders are generally preferred for coffee, where consistent grind size is essential for optimal brewing.

**Blue Moon Belgian White ‚Äì A Refreshing Wheat Beer**

Blue Moon Belgian White Ale offers a refreshing and approachable experience, a popular rendition of a Belgian-style wheat beer. It is indeed brewed with Valencia orange peel, coriander, and oats for a smooth, creamy body and aromatic citrus notes.

## Core Benefits

Buying beer by the case presents several advantages, particularly for frequent beer drinkers or those who entertain frequently enough.

**Cost Savings:** Purchasing beer in bulk, like a case, almost always provides greater cost savings compared to buying individual bottles or six-packs. The price per unit is usually significantly lower.**Convenience:** Having a case of your favorite beer on hand eliminates the need for frequent trips to the store. This is particularly valuable for people who live far from grocery stores or prefer to minimize shopping trips.

**Consistency:** quality brews are consistent in flavor and overall experience. By buying a full case, you know you're getting the same beer style over and over again, which can't be the same when looking for new brews every time you shop.

**Stocking Up for Gatherings:** A case of beer is perfect for parties, barbecues, and other social gatherings. It ensures you have enough beer to accommodate your guests without running out and having to make a last-minute store run.

**Trying new styles:** Buying new beers in a case will allow you to experiment, and share with friends. A beer that you might have not wanted to drink alone will be easier to consume when more people are around.## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about purchasing beer by the case.

**How long does beer typically last?**
Most commercially produced beers will remain enjoyable for several months after the date on the label, as beers do go ""bad."" The flavors soften as the beer ages beyond its ""ideal"" consumption window, but refrigeration can extend that period. However, beers with high hop content, like IPAs, are best consumed sooner rather than later to enjoy their vibrant hop aromas and flavors.

**What's the best way to store a case of beer?**
Ideally, store beer in a cool, dark place. Basements and pantries are often suitable locations. Avoid storing beer in direct sunlight or warm areas, as this can accelerate the aging process and led to off-flavors. Keeping beer refrigerated will extend its shelf life.

**How many beers are typically in a case?**
A standard case of beer typically contains 24 bottles or cans of 12-ounce servings. However, some craft breweries may offer cases with different quantities or different sizes. Such as,some cases contain 12 bottles of larger formats.

**Is buying beer in a case always cheaper?**
Generally, buying beer in a case is cheaper than purchasing smaller quantities. However, it's always a good idea to compare the price per unit to ensure you're getting the best deal.Also, keep an eye out for sales and promotions, as individual six-packs or twelve-packs may sometimes be on sale for a lower price.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üòä

Ever had one of those ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments that made you go, ‚ÄúIf I knew this back then, I‚Äôd be a freaking genius by now!‚Äù? I know I have, and it changed the game for me when it comes to focus. 

So, let‚Äôs talk about the lessons that have helped us zero in on what truly matters. Here‚Äôs mine: **‚ÄúHow to Work Smarter, Not Harder.‚Äù** 

I remember slogging through my to-do list like a zombie, coffee in hand, thinking I was being productive. Spoiler alert: I wasn‚Äôt. Here's what I learned that turned my focus levels up to 11:

- **Prioritize like a boss:** I used to tackle whatever popped up first. Now? I whip out my trusty list and ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gonna move the needle?‚Äù If it‚Äôs not on the list, it might get pushed to next week's episode of *""Will I Ever Finish This?""*

- **Time blocking:** Blocking out time for specific tasks has been a game changer. It‚Äôs like scheduling a hot date with my productivity‚Äîand you better believe I show up. üìÖ Set a timer, and when it buzzes, you can move on, guilt-free! 

- **Eliminating distractions:** Hello, social media! You beautiful, shiny distraction... I used to think I could just power through those notifications. Newsflash: I can‚Äôt. Now, I put my phone in another room while I work. Out of sight, out of mind, amirite? 

- **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, just do it NOW. Procrastination, who? ‚úåÔ∏è It‚Äôs like a mini win every time! 

- **Mindfulness breaks:** Looking back, I definitely underestimated the power of a quick breathing exercise or stretch. Who knew my brain needed a breather too? It's like I hit the refresh button on my focus! 

But let me ask you‚Äîwhat about YOU? What‚Äôs your ‚ÄúIf I knew then‚Ä¶‚Äù moment that turned your focus from frenzied to fierce? Got any tips or funny stories about your journey?

Background: just graduated college with two degrees, and I just started my new job.

I want to ask for advice on weather this is just anxiety or of i should go see a doctor about this. Over the last month I have started to feel very tired and unmotivated, and then one day I felt as if i couldn't speak or remember anything, its as if my mind went blank so I started to panic because I thought I was having a stroke. I went to the ER and they did blood work, EKG test, blood pressure test, and some basic physical test (such as testing sensitivity around my body). They said I had nothing to worry about and they prescribed me hydroxyzine for anxiety relief. Over the next couple of weeks I decided to quit nicotine and I convinced myself that any of the negative symptoms I was feeling such as brain fog, loss of balance, changes in mood were all nicotine withdrawals. My symptoms seemed to have calmed down a bit until I started my new office job. Recently I have started to feel the same symptoms, and some new ones, such as brain fog, slurred speech, loss of balance, weakness, blurry vision, and a tingling sensation in my right arm when I try to fall asleep. I have been hypervigilant over my symptoms and I could be having a case of health anxiety.

My family is telling me that its all in my head and that I just need to stop worrying about it. I understand why they think that but I honestly feel as if something is wrong with me, and I want to know if anxiety could be the reason I am feeling these symptoms, or if perhaps I should get a neurological examination. I have been researching my symptoms and parkinsons, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and brain damage all keep appearing. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

\*Side note on adderall: I seldomly took any, at the height of me using it I used it for two weeks straight (10mg XR), perhaps this messed up my prefrontal cortex?

1mcv593,https://i.redd.it/7ua7i4hz4xff1.jpeg,Daughter,"I slowly paced back and forth through the upper apartment of the entire home we were renting from an unsavory landlord. Despite his searching for answers to his life's problems at the bottom of a bottle, he cobbled together a two story home which gave safe harbor to my quaint family.

My daughter, Rose, was finally fast asleep, gripping my loose white tee shirt. I sighed quietly with relief, as this was not the first night we had trouble putting her down for extended sleep.

Rose had just hit the milestone of seven months old, by now she was able to provide much needed sleep for myself and her mother by not requiring feeding every two hours. For the first few days as a seven month old, she was as precious as could be, wistfully snoring away the moonlit hours with no crying or fussing, allowing some hard earned rest to her parents. While I could function off of five hours minimum, my wife struggled more with the lack of sleep. I did right by my wife, offering endless support. It was the least I could do after she pushed our eight pound seven ounce miracle free from her 'guttyworks'.

It was an interesting time being a parent, I couldn't help but smile as I sat on our sectional couch in the living room, finally allowing my eyes to close for the night, my daughter safely deposited into her crib. No sooner did I relax, did a frightful cacophonous wailing echo throughout our apartment.

Bolting upright, I quickly strode into my daughters room, opening the door gently as I possibly could to minimize any distress the poor child was dealing with. Despite the incessant wailing, Rose calmly slept. Her mouth did not move, nor did she have any expression of pain across her cherub face. She looked warm, comfortable, and altogether unbothered by the situation. I rested my hand upon her crib that I built myself staring at her muffled movements in the darkness of her room.

As my sleepy parent brain adjusted, I could still hear the crying, though it was coming from another part of the upstairs floor. I crept around slowly, as my wife was still fast asleep in bed, only to find our black cat, Felony, wide awake and sitting at the sliding glass door to our back deck. Her tail twitched, and brushed the cold linoleum as her ears perked up at the increasingly distressing wailing.

It sounded just like Rose on her worst day, if she absolutely wasn't having it. Walking up to Felony, I scratched her backside. She calmly turned her emerald eyes toward my beleaguered face and let out a quiet meow, as if whispering to me to not disturb whatever was making that terrible racket.

Sitting on the cold linoleum floor, staring out at the night sky offered me some perspective. Though the crying was worse from this part of the house, it appeared as though it was coming from below our deck. I checked my smart watch. The ruddy cheeks and baggy eyes of mine formed a strange reflection overlapping with *Mickey Mouse*'s whimsical eternal smile from the sixties. The digital clock read 4:08AM.

I opened the glass door to the back porch and stepped outside, with Felony in tow.

""Call Clyde."" I whispered into my smart watch. The silent vibrato buzzed in the quiet dawn of the not-yet-morning.

""Mikey."" The voice responded, awake, as I thought he would be. 

""Hey, I just put Rose down, do you think you can-""

""I'm so sorry, son. I gotta get better at this."" His quick apology assured my suspicions. Clyde, my wife's father, had been living below us for the better part of a decade, helping our small family grow and help us pay the cost of rent to the building. The old-timer was good for money, and loved Rose, as she was the first legitimate grand-child he was ever able to hold in his arms. Clyde had a proclivity for all kinds of action and horror movies, habitually watching them at a volume wholly reserved for *AC/DC* concerts. Aside from that one quirk, he was a stellar father-in-law, and did right by us.

""Thanks man, I'll get you a coffee tomorrow.""

""Appreciate it, kiddo. Welcome to raising children.""

""How am I doing so far?"" I asked, knowing he'd be straight with me.

""Better than most. I'll let you get some sleep."" With that, he disconnected the call. I sighed and went back into the house. The caterwauling had stopped, and Felony was uninterested in the sliding glass door. I gave her some treats, as a reward for helping me solve the mystery of the wailing baby. I then got comfortable on our sectional couch, and fell fast asleep.

Four hours later with coffee in hand, I knocked on the lower door to our house. Clyde groggily opened the door and scratched the two caterpillars on his face he called eyebrows.

""Here."" He swiped at his mug, but I pulled back letting him suffer for a moment. ""I don't want to be a bother but the headphones we gave you last Christmas, how come you don't use those?"" I then handed him his coffee, which he graciously accepted.

""They aren't loud enough."" He took a swig of the morning brown and waggled an eyebrow. ""I mean, well, they broke.""

""How did they break?"" The cost wasn't the issue, we could easily get him another pair, but it was upsetting that a man so good with older technology could scarcely keep a pair of analog headphones in good condition.

""Tried to turn them to max volume, with that little wheel do-hickey. It snapped and broke the volume control. I can't get any sound in them anymore. Sorry."" He looked downcast. I suddenly felt as if I had kicked a small puppy. I relented.

""Well, alright man. Just, no more late night horror movies anymore. That wailing was terrible."" I paused when he furrowed his brow in confusion. ""What?""

""Mikey, I was watching *Casablanca.*""

""Good one."" I wasn't a fan of the classics, but there was no way in hell a crying baby was in *Casablanca*.

""No, seriously. Look."" Clyde beckoned me into his neatly kept apartment. He had an expansive collection of physical movies and multiple combination DVD & Blu-Ray players. The prize of his collection was a vintage *Sony* SL8000 Beta-max player. It rarely saw use, but sat atop a pedestal closely among the VHS devices that absolutely dominated the market at the time.

On his coffee table, with his pack of cigarettes and a drained glass of bourbon, still sitting next to a mostly full bottle, was the VHS copy of *Casablanca*. The tape that rested in the sleeve had been inserted into the fourth most available VCR closest to one of his old tube television sets that he utilized for the *experience*.

""Refresh my memory, do any babies cry in that movie?"" Maybe I was wrong. Maybe when Humphrey Bogart said *'Here's looking at you, kid.'* It could have been possible that his delivery, although perfect, would have upset a baby nearby.

""Mikey, you're a new parent. This is the first time you and Angela have ever done something like this. Look, go to work. I'm off today so I can take Angie and Rosie out for some dinner and you can catch up on some sleep when you get home."" I nodded along to his prattling. I knew what I heard last night, I didn't think it was some fluke. Even Felony heard something. But I figured Clyde was right. I just wanted to be a good dad. This opportunity of fatherhood was something that had happened once before, but was ripped away from me.

""Yeah, okay. You're right. Thanks.""

""We're family. You're a good dad. Even the best of dads need a break now and again."" Clyde clapped me on the shoulder, and I left for work.

I couldn't focus a lot on my tasks that day. The mundane office job I had was better than most. Free coffee, a gym across the hall, lots of downtime between calls on the weekends. Something kept digging at me. Clyde called me a good dad, but I'm sure he wouldn't if he knew some of the earlier choices I made in life.

I was sweet on his Angela. The anatomy of our love blossomed when I first met her at Church. Angie and I had been in love for a few years, and I took it slow. But before Angie, there was Veronica. She was the first woman I had married. It was a different love than Angie. Angie was safe, and she had a good work ethic. She wasn't about taking risks, nor was she unpleasant to be around. She had a beautiful smile and was traditional in all aspects of home-keeping. I had to fight her just to do chores around the house. But Veronica, she was something else entirely.

Veronica oozed freedom. She was an untamed mythical eagle forever soaring among the clouds, this woman could turn any mundane encounter into an adventure. She lived fast, and hard, and loved just as equally. When I had proposed to her all those years ago, I was sure she'd laugh in my face. But she surprised me.

""Okay lover-boy. Make me yours."" She was the Mary-Jane to my Peter Parker.

Everything she did was crazy, and I was just happy to be along for the ride. She was full of beautiful life, and vim, until she we got pregnant. Veronica changed completely. 

Around her friends she was still this legend among legends, but she slowly turned insular. No longer did she feel like going out, or doing the fun things we did. She wasn't about drinking, or drugs or partying that way, but you can be damned sure she would be the first at the front of the concert venue, dancing like crazy to whatever songs were on the playlist.

At twenty weeks, when we found out it was going to be a girl. Veronica snapped. She practically shoved her denim skirt back down and pushed the ultrasound tech to the ground. I hastily apologized while I chased after my then pregnant wife. She got in the driver's seat of our mustang and glared daggers at me as I got in.

""I can't do girls Mikey. Nuh-uh, no way."" She was upset, and now had been venting, driving erratically across the back roads that wove through the dense forests which would take us back home. Her eyes were tear stained, and she would constantly take her hand off the wheel to rub away the rogue tears streaming down her face. Though I hated it, she still smoked small puffs of cigarettes, but when she was livid the long drag of nicotine was the only master that could tame her foul temper. Veronica would let go of the wheel to rummage for her cigarettes and light one, puffing like a dragon as she floored the gas.

""Why not? I thought you'd be thrilled. You'd make the coolest mom I'd ever know."" The compliment was lost on her. I hold onto the *whoa fuck* handle in the passenger seat, regretting not pulling her out of the drivers seat.

""No way. My mom was a cunt, she treated me like shit, like I was nothing."" Tears streamed down her face.

""That doesn't mean you'd treat our little girl like that. It's a blessing babe, how good will it feel to be an even better mother then your mom?"" I never would get anything further from Veronica as it was destined a tree would fall in our path. As her one hand was free wiping away her tears, she overcompensated with the other, lurching the car over the cliff down into the forest below.

I don't remember much of what happened during the rolling of our car, but I remember being thrown quite a distance. When I woke from the delirium, what I saw would be etched into my memory forever.

Veronica was dead, her neck snapped and bent at an odd angle. Her eyes and mouth were permanently in a surprised expression, as the vertebrae of her spine stuck out from her neck, without breaking skin. There seemed to be an internal pooling of blood from the odd angle of her neck.¬†The bulging H.R. Geiger nightmare gawped from broken branches at me like the eye of Satan.

Though it was assuredly broken, it looked like a pimple yet to pop, as the swelling red liquid rose to the point that just couldn't penetrate her skin. Something must have detached from the car, as her belly was split wide open. The morbid cesarean performed on her by what was likely car or tree shrapnel was horrific.

Her lower intestine had sagged somewhat, and the umbilical cord complete with what was still my developing daughter rested just below on the ground. Our unborn daughter who was still attached to the mother quivered in the cold.

I stood stock still, shocked at the carnage that lay before me. I could only stare at the underdeveloped infant that was my unnamed daughter as it struggled to survive. Overcome by the accident, and bleeding from my head, I didn't know what to do. The poor child, not yet made for this earth expired, it's little lungs unable to suck air or cry. The horrible noise it made as it took its last breaths on this plane of existence were mucus filled cries, not loud enough to be anything considered human, but they would haunt me to this day.

At the time, all I could do was weep. I took the discarded remains of our child and placed it further ahead in the woods, hastily burying it with leaves and twigs. Her glassy eyes looked at me from beyond the veil. I don't know if it was shame on that small face that glared at me, or it was upset at its circumstance. It was the best I could do at the time. I later lied to the paramedics who arrived on scene upon me calling for assistance and said I had been out for some time. I made a great effort to hide my tracks to our unnamed baby's grave, I didn't want to ever relive the memory of the alien creature of my wife's insides, warbling as it died. When all was said in done, I was in the hospital by 4:08pm.

The guilt would still bubble over sometimes as I held Rose tight to my chest. I lamented the life un-lived from my first child, the one that would never be.

""Mikey, you okay?"" Snapping out of my haze, from the fluorescent lights of the call center, I turned to see one of the other team leads waving a hand in my face. ""Getting enough sleep there, bud?""

""Yeah, sorry. Parenthood is tough. This is you in three weeks Michelle, though I figure since you're growing the child you'll probably more tired."" She smiled and rubbed her belly to my response.

""Yeah, I start my maternity leave tomorrow. I'm excited. Rick keeps asking how you've been doing and I tell him you look tired each and every day. He said he's gonna take some paternal leave to help me for the first little bit.""

""I advocate for that. I would take more if I could, to be honest. Tell him to take two months, not one.""

""I will, thanks. Hey, it's not super busy, I can cover for you if you wanna go home?"" She didn't have to ask me twice, I clocked out from my desk and gave her a hug. She waved me out of the office and I left to the security guard telling me to get some rest.

The drive home was four minutes and eight seconds. I was still groggy by the time I climbed the stairs and unlocked the door. Angie was still home, and Rose was in good spirits. I mumbled to her one word; 'sleep' and passed out on the couch. I could hear Rose babbling happily and in the ether of my dreams, eventually I heard the front door open and then close.

The smell of pizza woke me out of my coma. I found a note on the box:

*Triple cheese, just as you like it. We're out for dinner. My dad said you needed a night off, and Rose needs to learn about restaurants. Plus I'm excited for the 'kids under three eat free' deal. We'll be home later.*

*Love, Angie*

The first bite of the slightly cold, but still incredibly greasy pizza uplifted my spirits. I cried a single tear of joy that my creature comforts were still looked after by my wife. Angie was certainly a lover more true than the sun, gifted by Christ himself. My father once told me that marriage is split sixty-forty. The trick of the split is that both halves of the partnership were always trying to be the sixty in that split. 

The bliss I felt, did not last long as Felony suddenly darted towards the back of the apartment, and sat stock still at Rose's bedroom door.

I heard a muffled cry from her bedroom.

My heart leapt into my chest. I re-read the note Angie had left me. ""*Rose needs to learn about restaurants.*"" Clearly Rose wasn't here. This certainly wasn't a restaurant.

What the fuck.

What was making that God-awful noise?

I sent Angie a text: *Rose is with you, right?* It was a stupid question, obviously, but I had to be sure. I didn't get a response right away so I slowly began the long walk to the back room. Every crease in the floorboards and creak from my weight caused me great unease.

What was happening?

What am I walking into?

Why is it upset?

What *is* it?

More questions raced through my mind as I slowly opened the door to the bedroom. I didn't turn on the light. The only ambient lighting that shone through the curtains was the setting sun. The crying continued, though it wasn't as loud as it was before. Felony suddenly stood up, her hackles raised as she made a low hiss, not wanting to step a single one of her paws into the room.

""It's okay girl, shh. I'll be okay."" I didn't truly know if I would be. Felony stood her ground, but walked no further. The dread of stepping closer to whatever was making the noise made my heart hammer loudly in my chest. As I took a single step into the room, my phone vibrated. The crying continued, this time louder.

Slowly, I read the message, now horrified at what I might find.

*Rose is here with me and my dad.* Attached was a picture of my beautiful daughter with spaghetti sauce on her porcelain features. I looked into the crib which had a lumpy figure moving within the blanket. I tried to rationalize what it was that was wailing so maliciously. Taking a breath, removing the blanket, I fell back screaming in sheer terror.

Veronica's baby, my other daughter, had found its way to me.

The umbilical cord clung to the child and its stout features. Its skin, her skin, was mottled and red. Though she would have been twenty weeks old at the time, whatever epidermis that would have been forming gave a sinewy appearance, was battered by an unkempt forest floor. Dried leaves and mud were spattered on the creature. It had two overlarge glassy eyes, that had a yellowed appearance in the sclera. She lacked a nose, but instead had a pushed in slit and cleft palate where the nose should be. The horror of her mouth had two sets of sharpened teeth on the top and bottom, and the mouth opened at a grimace that would be impossible for a regular baby. The shape of the horror could almost be described as avian.

This undulating creature from my personal hell, climbed over the edge, and lowered itself to the floor. I scrambled back more, back toward the doorway, but hit the corner of the door frame, hurting myself in the process. With every movement it made, a feeble step, or it crawling trying to stand, and fail, on unformed legs with no joints to support it, an ungodly squelching noise came with it. It would hoist itself up on its two legs, and then fall forward clumsily on its hands. With every failed attempt to stand and walk, it shrieked in agony. As it inched ever closer to me, I could see a prehensile tongue flick out, much like a crawling lizard, wafting through the air, trying to determine where I was.

The terrible howl continued, Felony raising her own into the fray. The orchestra of madness reached its zenith, when courage finally found me.

I flicked on the bedroom light.

Gone was the totality of darkness, the room now bathed in a comforting light.

The creature, my unborn child, that terrible *thing,* was no longer there.

Any viscera it had left in both the bassinet, or the floor of Rose's room was gone. Felony and I both were confused, and still rattled from the experience.

""You saw that too girl?"" The emerald green eyes of my cat gave me a knowing look.

My phone was vibrating. Six missed calls from Angie. What was perhaps only a minute was in actuality half an hour. I immediately called her back as I searched Rose's room for the malfeasance that lingered within it.

""Michael, are you okay?"" She was stern, using her motherly voice. Angie only ever called me Michael when she was with Rose.

""A little rattled. I got some sleep but had a terrible nightmare.""

""You don't sound so good, pizza was a bad call?""

""No hon, pizza is great. Listen-"" I could hear movement in the living room. I lurched my body out and could see Felony playing with one of her toys. Her temperament was solid, so I felt safe for the moment. ""I have to go for a bit of a drive, I gotta go up north about an hour to the other call center, since I left early they wanted me to head over and check on some things with the new employees."" It was a shitty lie, but I needed something.

""This late at night?"" My wife saw through it immediately.

""Yeah, it's *because* I left early that they're making me do it. The other team leads that could be available don't have access to a car, I'm the only one that does."" I fucking sucked at lying.

""Well, alright then. Hey, save some pizza for Rose. I wanna give her a small bite to see what she thinks.""

""I only had a single slice before falling back asleep, there's plenty left.""

""Okay, say bye to daddy Rosie!"" Angie put the phone up to rose on speaker. I could hear the beautiful babbling of my living daughter. I wept, the beauty of my living child and her cooing voice comforted me. 

""Bye honey, daddy will be home late tonight! Be good for your mom!"" We said our goodbyes, and I silently prayed for Rose.

I couldn't let this thing near her.

Something had to be done.

I cursed the weather, as it grew tumultuous on the drive toward her resting place. A rainfall began no sooner did I leave my apartment. I said a possible final goodbye to Felony, and left a note for Angela. I admitted everything, told her about Veronica, of who she knew, but also the unborn daughter of whom I buried hastily, that she did not know about.

The image still vexed me, the unborn girl who was never meant to be. Though I didn't hear her cries as I drove, the thunder-crash and lightning gave all the pageantry of her misery. I couldn't be certain that my plan would work, though I had to try. 

In my hasty preparation on my way to the end at the beginning, I searched the internet for curses. Any sort of malignant power, anything related to harm done to children. Aside from the biblical threat from Jesus Christ Himself warning me of the fate of gnashing teeth and great weeping I would receive for my transgressions I found a single hit.

Poroniec.

The word was Slavic in origin, and belonged to a subset of Scandanavian folklore that related to the mistreatment of unbirthed children. I didn't know what *she* was, but she certainly had been mistreated all those years ago.

I would give her a proper burial, hopefully appeasing her.

Eventually, I reached the same hairpin turn which once held a fallen tree. Though it was a few years since our crash, I could still see area of the forest the mustang had ruined. There was an overgrowth, but nothing I couldn't navigate. I had a flashlight clipped to my hi visibility overcoat, as well as reflective tape to help mark my passageway back to my car.

Before I could make my way down the precarious embankment toward my destination, a horrible screech of tires and crash of metal interrupted any thoughts I had. Though I believed I had pulled over far enough, the rain caused visibility to be poor, and as such a tractor trailer slammed into my car. The resulting aftershock launched me over the guard rail, and I tumbled headfirst into a thicket of darkness.

A familiar sensation overtook me as I fell. I could see the past as it had happened, I felt all the rolls of the mustang I was once in match this future that I had yet to experience. I could see Veronica, panicking in the car, holding onto her belly. Despite all things I had believed, it relieved me to see her in her last moments show love to the child we could have had. I felt my body strike something with a wet *thud* and I passed out.

I woke, an unknown amount of time later. The rain was still falling, though not as harshly. I sucked wind and checked my body for injuries. My ankle was twisted completely around, the pain was indescribable. Like one thousand tiny knives all cut it at once, from every angle. I checked my flashlight, relieved to see it still worked. Through the murky bramble of wet and autumn leaves, I was shocked to see the site of our crash.

I wasn't sure if I should thank God or curse Him.

I stood, weakly, looking for a branch to help support my weight, luckily there were thick enough sticks I could cobble together a makeshift crutch. Hobbling my way to where I had buried her, or at least where I thought I had buried her, I could see a disturbance in the ground.

It had been years, but I was prepared in the event wildlife had got to her. Digging up the hastily dug grave I once had created for her, I found small lumps of viscera which I assumed to be remnants of my little girl. I cried, thinking of Rose. What a fate that could have been hers. Would I bury her like this too? How could I have been so uncaring?

The task at hand, with pain and blood slowly ebbing from my wounded ankle, I resolved to make things right. I took whatever discarded rotted lumps of meat that were within the hole and wrapped them from a piece of my garment. I reburied them and used two sticks to mark the grave site. I prayed the Lord's Prayer, weeping through the verses. My breathing had become ragged. I removed the flashlight from my coat and re-examined myself. I could feel a piercing pain in my abdomen, as the rain still fell, it was hard to see what was wrong, but I wasn't sure I would have much more time to do what needed to be done. I finished the grave, scrawling her name into the cross of sticks. My ruined fingernails and broken body finally sighed as I finished with her name.

*Anna*.

My work was completed. I leaned back, against the closest tree to the grave. Terror overcame me again as the same putrescent creature in Rose's bed crawled from just beyond the gloom in the forest. It was still frightfully deformed, and repulsive to look at. The rain pinging against its broken body made it shudder. For the first time since I laid eyes upon the creature, I felt pity. What sort of father could leave his daughter alone, in such a condition. I swallowed, tears welling up in my eyes.

""Anna. Come here, come sit with your father."" If it could be called a 'smile' the multiple rows of teeth all at once twisted into a childlike grin. It didn't hurry toward me, but crawled with a hastened speed. The smell of it was unbearable, the rotted flesh of a carcass mixed with spoiled meat. The prehensile tongue came out and licked one of the glassy yellow eyes, bulging from its horrible face. The crying began to disappear. A strange cooing noise emerged from the creature, from Anna. No longer was I plagued by its caterwauling. My heart felt at ease, and my body less heavy.

""I did you wrong Anna, but no more. I've marked where I left you, and I've named you. I will always love you, just as much as Rose. I did this for her, and for you."" I wasn't sure if she could understand me, but the unsettling fetal monstrosity looked and listened to what I had to say. If it could comprehend me, I hoped that my words reached it. I felt as though I was forgiven. The mottled beast, my unborn daughter Anna, closed its murky eyes and began to snore, near the wound in my abdomen.

""I'm sorry."" Was the last thing I said, as I stroked her coarse skin atop her head. Soon, everything went dark, and I fell away into a void.

They found me a day later, half starved and bleeding out. This was due to the letter I left my wife. I don't recall many questions, though I was in no condition to answer any of them. I believe one of the responding EMT's asked me *'Who's Anna?'.* I just laughed. 

Couldn't he see? 

I was later committed, as I felt I was thoroughly unwell. It was mostly my choice, which Angie and Clyde respected. I told them about what I had experienced.

They didn't believe me. Not many did.

They still visited me regularly, Angie remarried after a few years. Rose grew into a fine young woman, and she still called me dad. I told her to be mindful of her mother, and listen to her step-father. Rose would tell me all about her school, her grades, boys she liked. It was a sense of normalcy, though nothing could ever truly be normal again. Her sister was often upset that I never introduced her, but I told her time and time again Rose wasn't ready yet. 

Clyde would visit from time to time. He looked at me as though I was a caged animal. Despite his wariness, Clyde listened to what I had to say and believed me when I told him about Anna.

He asked me what Anna looked like.¬†

I had attempted to draw her once, from my memory, foggy as it was. Every time I put pen to paper the image wouldn't look quite right. The doctors who had approved my drawings deemed me unfit for re-entry. I soon stopped trying to explain what I could see, or who was there if only to be left alone to my own devices.

But Anna was with me. Her many rows of teeth and mottled skin. Her beautiful glassy eyes and prehensile tongue, which would affectionately bathe me in kisses whenever I returned to my cot, in the room I was allowed. She was a good girl, I was glad that I had her. Her angelic wings would spread out and cover us while we napped together.

I loved her, and rocked her to sleep nightly, ensuring she never cried again.

My precious daughter.

My little angel, Anna.

I make a checklist of cleaning tasks every morning on a whiteboard in the kitchen and check them off as I go. I‚Äôve recently switched from being able to get them done early in the day to having to do it in the afternoon again, and now he gets mad that I don‚Äôt include him in the cleaning process. He says I‚Äôm being passive aggressive and taking time from us, even though I never clean for more than 45 minutes a day. 

FULL CONTEXT BELOW

My boyfriend (M32) and I (F31) moved in together about 4 months ago. Prior to moving in we discussed a lot of what I thought would be most crucial to making things work well. We discussed a split of finances proportional to what we make (60/40 split because I make slightly more), we talked about using whiteboards to make lists of things for groceries or to do around the house, and most importantly to this situation we discussed our cleaning habits and expectations. Now it was clear I have the more consistent cleaning expectations, but we both believed before the start of the work week the house should be clean. I like to clean a little every day and he prefers to save it for one weekend day. We also discussed that because I feel like cleaning more frequently he would cook somewhat more often than me. 

The last few weeks have been rough. I have summers off to stay home with my son (10), so I have been planning my days mostly around having the cleaning done before 11am then spending time out of the house doing fun summer activities before coming home with dinner in mind. For most the summer I didn‚Äôt mind cleaning and making dinner, but as I gear up to go back to work and my son going back to school I‚Äôve brought up that I feel it has been an unbalanced workload on me recently and asked for him to support with cooking OR cleaning more again. He agreed and we moved on. He did begin cooking more again (YAY), but has started being annoyed every time I‚Äôm cleaning and he is home. 

The tension boiled over this week. Over the weekend, we planned to go school supply and clothes shopping Saturday morning then clean together in the afternoon. I woke up early and didn‚Äôt want to wake anyone up, so I went downstairs to have coffee and read. When I sat my book on the kitchen counter it was sticky, so I decided to quickly just tidy the kitchen and wipe the counters down. When my bf came down stairs he asked what I was doing and I simply replied cleaning the counters. He then said he thought we discussed doing the cleaning in the afternoon. I responded yes we are but the counters were dirty so I wanted to clean them off before having coffee. He rolled his eyes, grabbed a quick snack for breakfast (only for himself), and went upstairs to get ready. I thought this was weird but moved on. After back to school shopping I dropped my bf and son off at home, so I could run one errand neither of them were keen on. When I came back my bf was organizing things in the garage and told me his plan was to start there then work his way through the living room and upstairs. I said great then went upstairs to work in the opposite direction so we‚Äôd both be done in less time. I do happen to clean pretty efficiently and really enjoy it, so I was done with the entire upstairs, a load of laundry, and was beginning to vacuum the living room when he came inside for a break from the garage. When he saw what I had accomplished he was clearly mad. He huffed and groaned about everything for the rest of the night barely speaking to me. I asked him about it the next morning and he said I was out of line for doing the work he had planned to do. He said I was not being a partner and was trying to do everything because he wasn‚Äôt on my timeline. I kept reiterating that I just wanted to help clean and he was taking a while to do the garage but that‚Äôs okay because that was a bigger project we have both talked about needing to be done. 

It boiled down to him basically feeling like I‚Äôm being passive aggressive by cleaning. His example was that I had started cleaning in the morning which he took as me being upset the house was a mess. My short response about cleaning before coffee, meant in his mind I was pissed I couldn‚Äôt even have coffee without having to clean. I explained this wasn‚Äôt the case and we talked about being more communicative going forward because I definitely wasn‚Äôt upset at all and was honestly happy to start the day with a clean kitchen. 

I thought we were all good, until today. I came home from setting some things up at work before I return next week, and sat with my bf in the kitchen for a few minutes when I got home. He asked what I needed to get done with the afternoon and I said I just had a few things to clean while I pointed to my checklist I made for cleaning tasks this morning. While I was talking he was scrolling on his phone and didn‚Äôt respond. Definitely a little annoying to be ignored after being asked a question, but he goes to work really early and is often exhausted by the afternoon so he was probably just zoned out. I gave him a minute or so to ask any follow up questions or continue the conversation and he didn‚Äôt. At that point I decided to begin my cleaning. As soon as I stood up, he asked what I was doing. I responded by saying I‚Äôm starting my cleaning like I just said. (I can see how he may have taken that as passive aggressive, but I was truly just trying to make the point I had communicated this to him a minute ago). I went upstairs to grab the vacuum and the mop and while I was upstairs I started some laundry. I came downstairs and he stood up to look at the checklist. He said, oh we need to do laundry and I responded yeah but I just started it so it‚Äôs on its way to done. I began vacuuming the downstairs and the guest bathroom before mopping it. While the floors were drying I ran upstairs to grab toilet cleaning supplies and some gloves and when my bf saw me carrying those he asked, so you‚Äôre cleaning the bathroom now? And I said yes and kept moving. He told me I needed to leave something for him to do. There were only four things in my list, vacuum the downstairs (done), clean the guest bathroom (in progress), laundry (in progress), and clean my son‚Äôs bathroom (not done). So at this point there still was one thing not being worked on:my son‚Äôs bathroom. I didn‚Äôt really respond and kept doing what I planned on. I finished the guest bathroom and went upstairs to put a few things away and my bf was taking a shower. While he showered I cleaned my son‚Äôs bathroom and I was happily just waiting for laundry to finish to be done with my list. 

My bf made a point of making dinner for himself when I suggested something easy like chicken strips for dinner. So I ended up cooking for my son and me, while my bf cooked himself food. The rest of the night my bf was on his phone scrolling and not making much conversation. I waited until bed time and asked why it bothered him that I cleaned and he said it was because I continue to not communicate and he feels like I wasted his afternoon by not letting him help. He also said it took away from our one on one time, but I checked our indoor living room camera and I cleaned for less than 40 minutes total. What am I missing? I made a list. I told him I wanted to clean, to which he ignored me. He had another task on the list he could have done. I don‚Äôt know what more I could have done. I‚Äôm not bothered by the amount of cleaning I‚Äôm doing. There‚Äôs no resentment on my end about the work it is, because it makes me feel better when the house is clean. The only thing that bothers me is my bf getting mad that I am cleaning and saying I am not communicating what I want to do. ",1,1753843203.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Hi. I‚Äôm Evan (22, TM). This is the first time I‚Äôm posting on Reddit since I got on the app a week ago. I‚Äôm feeling really guilty and confused right now I need some advice/opinions. 

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend, Julian (28M), for 8 months, and he‚Äôs honestly amazing most of the time. I‚Äôm pretty new to serious relationships, and sometimes I worry I‚Äôm not good enough for him. Last night, we had a fight, and I ended up leaving his place to stay with a friend. I feel like I overreacted, but I‚Äôm also kinda hurt, and I need help figuring out if I‚Äôm the asshole here.

So, a bit about us: I‚Äôm a part-time barista and studying graphic design at community college. I‚Äôm still figuring out life as a trans guy, and Julian‚Äôs been super supportive and a loving boyfriend. Sometimes he evens offers to help cover my T costs when I‚Äôm strapped for cash or checking in to make sure I‚Äôm okay. He‚Äôs charming, has a solid marketing job, and he‚Äôs always caring, always planning cute dates or making sure I‚Äôm eating when I‚Äôm stressed out. But sometimes he gets‚Ä¶ overly protective? Like, he‚Äôll ask a ton of questions about who I‚Äôm with, where I‚Äôm going or say things like, ‚ÄúI just want you to be safe/you‚Äôre too trusting.‚Äù At first, I thought it was sweet, but lately, it feels a bit overbearing, like I can‚Äôt move without him needing to know.

Anyway the fight happened two days ago and happened was: I posted an instagram story of me grabbing coffee with my friend Bruno (24M), who‚Äôs also my ex from a couple years ago(we dated briefly for a year ish and now we‚Äôre just friends who catch up sometimes) My insta story was literally just us holding coffee cups and I captioned it ‚Äúcaffeine catch-up.‚Äù which I thought was totally harmless but apparently it wasn‚Äôt. 

Julian saw it and got quiet, which is his thing when he‚Äôs upset and I‚Äôve gotten used to it. Then later, he asked why I didn‚Äôt tell him I was meeting Bruno. I said it was just coffee there was no big deal, but he said it ‚Äúlooks bad‚Äù to post with an ex and that I should‚Äôve checked with him first. He wasn‚Äôt yelling or anything but he was super serious saying stuff like, ‚ÄúI trust you, but you don‚Äôt get how this comes off to other people.‚Äù and then I got defensive because it‚Äôs literally MY instagram and I wasn‚Äôt hiding anything and he had nothing to worry about. 

But things got heated. I told Julian he was overreacting, and he said I was being naive, that posting the story made him feel disrespected. He insisted I take it down and unfollow Bruno‚Äôs account. His voice got loud, almost aggressive, which threw me off, but then he softened and said it‚Äôd ‚Äúmean a lot‚Äù if I did it. I felt so trapped that I unfollowed Bruno(which I totally regret now because I only did it under pressure) but when he kept pushing me to delete the story too, sounding more frustrated, I dug in and said no, I wasn‚Äôt taking it down. I told him we both needed space to cool off, or this fight was just going to spiral. We were both pretty worked up, so I grabbed my backpack and left to crash at my friend Sam‚Äôs place (23F, we met in art class). I didn‚Äôt tell Julian where I was going because I was still kinda pissed and just needed to think. Now I feel so dumb for being so dramatic, but I was just so overwhelmed in the moment.

Now it‚Äôs 3AM I‚Äôve been ignoring his texts but he texted me an apologies saying he didn‚Äôt mean to upset me and that he was just jealous because he cares so much about me. He said he‚Äôs cool with me hanging with Bruno but wishes I‚Äôd be more ‚Äúopen‚Äù about my plans so he doesn‚Äôt feel left out. He even sent a voice note saying he misses me and wants to talk when I‚Äôm ready. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I made a big deal out of nothing‚Ä¶. 

The thing is he is older and has more relationship experience so maybe I was the one being thoughtless?? I still love him of course and he‚Äôs usually so great, but sometimes I feel like he has these barriers that he puts up and he comes off as overprotective. I haven‚Äôt gone back to his place yet, and the story‚Äôs not up anymore because I eventually chose to delete it the more I felt guilty and bad about it. Anyways I‚Äôm so sorry if this is long to read but that‚Äôs all

I don't really have a budget in mind for this one, I'm assuming less than a grand for the plumbing (hopefully), I'm just south of the river in Perth. I have a 2 bowl kitchen sink that has the usual pipework underneath. I'd like to have a plumber split the waste underneath into a 3 part waste and to split the hot and cold water to make a coffee station in my lounge room in a built in cabinet (I'll build the cabinetry). I have this drawing of what I'm kind of looking for. My question is, is this allowed/ would this be okay/how much would this actually cost?

1mcuyym,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mcuyym/the_island_that_trembled/,The Island That Trembled,"In 2000, I was stationed on a small Japanese island, working for the Atmospheric and Oceanographic Administration. Basically, my job was to monitor weather patterns and seismic activity‚Äîespecially anything that could trigger tsunamis.



The island was quiet, the kind of place where the loudest thing at night was the cicadas. A single road looped around its jagged coast, connecting two tiny fishing villages to our lonely research outpost. I used to think the silence was comforting.

Then the earthquakes started.

The first tremor was barely enough to rattle my coffee cup, but the seismograph needle flickered in an odd pattern. Normally, quakes in the region are caused by the subduction zone just offshore‚Äîclassic megathrust activity. But this didn‚Äôt feel the same. Instead of a sharp jolt followed by fading aftershocks, it pulsed. Like a heartbeat.

Over the next week, the tremors returned, each one stronger than the last. The villagers grew restless. An old fisherman, his hands like driftwood, told me over miso soup:

*‚ÄúThe ocean is angry. It wants to be heard.‚Äù*



I smiled politely and went back to my charts. Science had answers. Or so I thought.



Then the first tsunami hit.



We had minutes of warning‚Äîbarely enough to radio the village‚Äîbut I watched helplessly from the cliffs as a wall of water tore through the southern shore. Homes shattered like toy blocks. A fishing boat was tossed onto the main road, perfectly upright, as if some child had placed it there. By nightfall, dozens were dead.

After that, I barely slept. My days were spent staring at seismographs, and my nights listening to the island breathe. The quakes weren‚Äôt following the usual subduction patterns. Megathrust quakes build pressure over years, even centuries, before snapping. But what we were seeing? It was too frequent. Too‚Ä¶ rhythmic.



Then the ocean started dying.

Fish washed ashore by the hundreds, pale and bloated, their eyes clouded. The hydrophones we‚Äôd placed offshore picked up low-frequency sounds that didn‚Äôt match any known geological event. At first, I thought it was equipment error. Then I heard it with my own ears one night‚Äîa deep, rolling groan carried on the wind, so low I felt it in my chest more than I heard it.

The villagers began leaving offerings on the beach. Bowls of rice. Fish heads. Incense burning against the salty wind. I asked one why, and he just said,

*‚ÄúTo calm it. Before it wakes up.‚Äù*



On the morning it all ended, the seismograph spiked so violently it tore the paper. I ran outside.



The world was‚Ä¶ wrong.



The horizon had pulled back. Miles of ocean had receded, exposing jagged black rock and glistening trenches in the seabed. I saw fishing boats stranded like toys on wet sand.

Then the ocean floor **moved**.



A mass the size of a stadium heaved upward, sending geysers of water into the sky. Barnacled ridges. Writhing tentacles. And then‚ÄîGod help me‚Äîan eye.



It rose above the water, yellow and veined, larger than the roof of our observatory. It swiveled toward the island, and I swear on everything I have left, it *looked at me.*



The roar that followed was not sound. It was force. Windows shattered. My teeth rattled. The ground *jumped.*



I ran for the radio, screaming coordinates, but it was already too late. A wall of water rose higher than the cliffs, blotting out the sun. I saw a single tendril slam onto the beach, flattening trees like blades of grass. And then the wave took everything.



I don‚Äôt remember the impact. I woke up days later, clinging to a splintered door, floating in the open ocean. The island was gone. Completely gone.



When I was rescued, they told me it was a ‚Äúmegathrust earthquake.‚Äù A once-in-a-century event. A natural disaster.



But I know the truth.



Something lives in the deep. Something big enough to move the seafloor and end a world if it wanted.



And in 2000, it woke up.",1,1753842856.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1mcuyy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/succulents/comments/1mcuyy4/two_years_of_keeping_succulents_mostly_alive_what/,"Two years of keeping succulents mostly alive- what I‚Äôve figured out, and where I‚Äôm still totally winging it","Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been keeping succulents for about two years now, and while I definitely wouldn‚Äôt call myself an expert, I‚Äôve gone from killing them within weeks to actually seeing some thrive (and even pup!).

I started with a few garden centre echeveria and haworthia in tiny pots- they looked cute and low effort. Spoiler: they are low effort... but only if you know what you‚Äôre doing. I didn‚Äôt. Since then I‚Äôve collected more (a jade, a couple sedum, a lithops I regret buying on impulse), and somehow kept most of them alive.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked, what hasn‚Äôt, and what I wish I‚Äôd known from the start:

**Things that actually helped:**

* Water way less than you think- and then wait longer lol. I used to stick to a once-a-week schedule and wondered why everything rotted. Now I check the soil with my finger or a moisture probe and only water when it‚Äôs bone dry. Sometimes I forget and it helps.
* Lighting matters more than people say. I thought a bright windowsill would cut it. For some plants it does, but most of mine started stretching like crazy. Once I moved them under a grow light (cheap IKEA clamp one), everything started compacting and colouring up properly.
* Used a mix of apps to stop guessing. Early on I had no clue what I was doing and honestly kept forgetting when I‚Äôd last watered or repotted anything. I‚Äôve used a few plant care apps since then- Most recently¬†[Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=R_s), found it to have the most accurate IDs and Health scanning but id say the UI on PlantNet and other apps are a bit better. As with anything double check on forums/sub-reddits like this one.
* Terracotta pots > plastic. More breathable = less rot. Now I repot anything I care about into terracotta or unglazed clay. Bonus: they look nicer.
* Bottom watering, especially in winter. It‚Äôs gentler and less likely to get water stuck in those annoying tight rosettes where it just sits and causes rot.

**Mistakes I‚Äôve fully owned:**

* Too much love. I used to hover over them, overwater, over-fertilize, and just generally mess with them too much. Most of them do better when I ignore them a bit.
* Random soil. I started with multipurpose compost and wondered why nothing drained. Now I mix my own (cactus mix + perlite + grit) and they dry out properly.
* Letting them stretch. I didn‚Äôt realise ‚Äúleggy‚Äù meant the light was too weak until I had a whole tray of etiolated sticks. Now I behead and restart when things go sideways.
* Buying plants that looked cool but were totally wrong for my space. Looking at you, lithops. You want full sun, zero water, and I live in the UK. We are not meant to be.

Weird thing I do that's helped-  
I made a habit of just looking at my plants every morning while I make coffee. No fussing, just observing. I started spotting early signs of stress- leaf shrivelling, colour fading, pest specks- before things got bad. Sounds basic, but it‚Äôs made the biggest difference.

Anyway, I‚Äôm still figuring things out- especially with over-wintering and light levels as the days get shorter here in the UK. Would love to hear how others manage succulents when there‚Äôs basically no sun for a month.

And if anyone has successfully kept lithops alive in the UK without a greenhouse, I need to know your secrets.",22,1753842855.0,succulents,5,0.96,False
1mcuycg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcuycg,(Almost) 1 year progress + method!,"Here is almost one year of progress. Disclaimer : not medical advice, this is just my routine. Talk to your dr., etc etc. anyway...My stack is on the last pic, but I will explain in detail below, both oral and topical routes:

------- 

Topical:

1. Obtain a 60 mL bottle of 5% Kirkland minox LIQUID w dropper (NOT foam stuff). This will be your solvent, as it contains ethanol, which can dissolve the following:
2. Grind up 12x1 mg finasteride tabs. I recommend using a coffee grinder or herb grinder. You want the finest powder possible. 12mg total = 0.02% in solution. Yes you want the concentration that small**
3. Get bulk RU58841 powder then weigh out 1.2 g = 1200 mg = 20 mg/mL = 2% in solution
4. Transfer the powders into the minox bottle. I recommend using a small funnel. Swirl mixture gently w cap on and allow 24 hrs for full dissolution. 
5. Apply 1mL per day, or 2 spaced out 8 hours apart for aggressive treatment. 
6. Apply when you have dry hair or not, it doesn't matter because the solvent and dissolved solutes (fin and RU) are hydrophobic {as long as it hits the SCALP not the HAIR}. Massage into scalp using dropper. DON'T use hair drier AFTER application! It will evaporate the ethanol carrier in the minox solution along with the solutes in it = the active ingredients won't dissolve into your scalp = wasted product and no hair gainz! 

** Topical fin and oral fin have nearly the same results but I'd rather not have fin go systemic using the oral route. As for small dosage, the original topical finast studies show highly diminishing returns after 0.02%. RU powder can be even more aggressive, up to 50-100 mg per day prn, but be careful. Work up to it. Always be safe and know your health ‚ù§Ô∏è

------

Oral:

1. Obtain 10 mg minox tabs (FAR less expensive cost long term vs buying 5mg tabs) 
2. Use a pill cutter to halve them into 5mg pieces.**
3. Take one 5mg piece per day. START SMALLER AT 1 MG THEN WORK UP. SOME PEOPLE HAVE HEART PROBLEMS w minox oral!

** Oral minox is 100% bioavailable in the liver compared to topical, it's not even close. Way more bang for your buck w oral. So if you're hair AND beard-maxing use oral. Works all over the body too but not in weird places. Example, I have chest hair now that I never had before, and my beard is much thicker. Head Hair is so thick I can barely run a brush through it now. As you can see in pics.

1mcuv47,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mcuv47/jars/,Jars,"
We are young, but not young enough to excuse our poor decisions. We hold shitty part-time jobs that pay minimum wage. We measure time in crushed beer cans, cigarette butts, and roaches, and, out of all the bad habits we indulge in, our friendship is arguably the least rewarding among them. 

So, there you go. That‚Äôs all you get for context. You don‚Äôt actually care about that bullshit anyways. What you want is a fucked up story with lots of sordid details. So, like a loving mother bird, I will happily regurgitate those details down your stupid, eager throats. Open wide‚Ä¶.

I sit on a curb in front of my apartment building and chainsmoke until Zach gets there. He‚Äôs wearing a white Affliction tee shirt and ripped jeans that he bought at the mall. He smells like whisky. He doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúhey‚Äù or ‚Äúsup‚Äù or anything, which is weird. We sit in silence for a long time, and I start to get annoyed. I don‚Äôt like feeling awkward, and I really don‚Äôt like feeling like I have to be the one to entertain people and shit. 

I stare out the window and pretend like I‚Äôm somewhere else. I see a dead animal on the road about a hundred yards ahead, and I get more excited the closer it gets. But as it comes into view, I see that its edges are too straight and perfect to be a deer or a raccoon. It‚Äôs just an old cardboard box that‚Äôs been sitting in the rain. 

By the time we get to Gabby‚Äôs sister‚Äôs place, the sun is down and half the sky is dark blue. Zach‚Äôs truck takes up two spaces in the parking lot. He takes a hit off his flask and doesn‚Äôt offer me one. 

‚ÄúGimme a cigarette,‚Äù he grunts. He‚Äôs embarrassed to ask because he always bitches at me for smoking too much. 

‚ÄúGimme that flask,‚Äù I snap back, not missing a beat.

We trade and I start to feel a little better, but Zach‚Äôs face is still stone when Gabby jumps in the backseat talking a mile-a-minute about how her sister is a bitch and how her sister‚Äôs boyfriend is an asshole and how she can‚Äôt wait to start working full time at Wendy‚Äôs so she can get her own place.

‚ÄúSo...you didn‚Äôt get the bud,‚Äù Zach snorts. It‚Äôs not a question. 

Gabby‚Äôs face contorts. ‚ÄúNo. But I got a plug.‚Äù

Zach scoffs. ‚ÄúWho? Mike Thompson? That kid sells bush.‚Äù He stops to take a drag. ‚ÄúAnd saying ‚Äòplug‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make you sound cool.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you! You white trash piece of shit. I haven‚Äôt bought from Mike since middle school. There‚Äôs this guy I met at camp when I was fifteen. He just moved here like a month ago. He said he‚Äôd give me an eighth for forty-five.‚Äù

Zach just laughs meanly and mutters something about a handjob underneath his breath. I‚Äôm pretty sure Gabby hears him, but she can tell Zach is in a mood, so she lets it go. She just rolls her eyes and gives him the dealer‚Äôs address. Zach peels out of the parking lot like an asshole. I keep wondering where I fit into their bullshit. I see myself becoming a third wheel, or a ghost only they can see, like Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Normally, I would do or say some crazy shit to focus the attention back on myself, but tonight I actually feel okay in the corner. It‚Äôs kind of cozy, even. 

‚ÄúYou still going to night school, Jess?‚Äù Gabby asks after a long silence.

I want to ignore her, but I tell her ‚Äúnah‚Äù because Zach‚Äôs already acting like a bitch, and we only need one of those. I take another pull from Zach‚Äôs flask. It‚Äôs warm down my throat. Gabby doesn‚Äôt respond. 

Without warning, Zach pulls into a liquor store parking lot.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù I ask him as he pops his door open and steps out. 

‚ÄúFree beer,‚Äù he grunts, slamming the door behind him. 

‚ÄúHe used to work with the guy with the guy at the register,‚Äù Gabby says, ‚ÄúI guess he owes Zach a favor for fixing his truck or something.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSweet,‚Äù I mutter.

‚ÄúJess, I think I might be pregnant,‚Äù she says out of nowhere. 

I turn around to face her. ‚ÄúBullshit. Why would you think that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I had my period on time and everything, but I was only spotting, which is weird for me. And lately, my nipples have been crazy sore.‚Äù 
She presses her tits together anxiously. 

I jab two fingers against my left eyebrow and shut my eyes tightly.

‚ÄúGabby, are you fucking kidding me? You can‚Äôt be pregnant if you had your period. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you were only spotting. I mean, do you live under a fucking rock? C‚Äômon dude.‚Äù

She pouts. ‚ÄúShit. Are you sure? What about the nipples?‚Äù

I ignore this. ‚ÄúWhy do you sound fucking disappointed? Shouldn‚Äôt you be, like, jumping for joy and shit?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am relieved. I just thought, I don‚Äôt know...I thought that even if I were pregnant, it wouldn‚Äôt be all that bad. Zach would actually have to start committing to shit. I thought it could be like a new start for us, y‚Äôknow? The other night, I told him that we should stop fucking other people, and he didn‚Äôt even laugh. I think we might be ready to take the next step in our relationship.‚Äù 

I look out the window. Zach is lugging a case of Milwaukee‚Äôs Best. His head is on a swivel like a paranoid idiot. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way of looking at it,‚Äù I say to Gabby, feeling tired. 

Zach heaves himself into the cab and sets the case next to Gabby in the backseat. 

‚ÄúA whole thirty rack, can you believe that shit? He even threw in a lighter, too.‚Äù He shows it to me, grinning like a crayon-eating feeb. Two flaming dice are stamped on the plastic wrapping.   

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool, Zach. Hey, you should ask Gabby about her nipples,‚Äù I say. 

He looks at me blankly. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I try to hold it together, but I bust up laughing. After a few seconds, Gabby cracks up too. She opens the case and pulls out three beers. 

Zach rolls his eyes and cracks open his beer. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt spill that shit in my truck,‚Äù he warns, even though his beer is overflowing onto his ape knuckles.  

We drive for about fifteen minutes longer before Gabby tells Zach to turn into a subdivision across the street from the old rec center. 

Identical red brick houses line the street. I can tell that it‚Äôs an old-person neighborhood by the tacky lawn ornaments and the old school caddies parked like boats in people‚Äôs driveways. 

‚ÄúAre you sure this is the right address?‚Äù I ask. Gabby says nothing. I look back and see that she‚Äôs chugging her beer. She crushes the can and rips a belch.

‚ÄúSorry. Yeah. It‚Äôs gotta be, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking nasty,‚Äù Zach growls. He parks in front of a house near the end of the street. A ceramic duck wearing a raincoat guards the front door. ‚ÄúDid you text him?‚Äù Zach asks, trying to sound like he doesn‚Äôt care. 

The sky is full dark now, and the air is wet and cold. I slurp down the dregs in my can. My guts are on fire with excitement. 

On cue, Gabby‚Äôs phone goes off. She reads a text and smiles. ‚ÄúHe says come inside.‚Äù 

I frown. I know exactly how this is going to happen. Drug dealers are all the same. They pull you into their little dungeons, make you hit their fancy new piece, and then they blab for an hour about how much better their shit is than everyone else‚Äôs. It‚Äôs like every little dimebag they sling is an opportunity for them to pretend like they‚Äôre a fucking kingpin. They don‚Äôt realize the only reason people are nice to them is because they‚Äôre stupid enough to sell weed. 

Zach says he‚Äôs going to wait in the truck, but Gabby bitches that he needs to come in case something happens.

‚ÄúWhat, you don‚Äôt trust your little camp buddy?‚Äù He taunts. 

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs not that. I just‚Ä¶haven‚Äôt seen him in a while.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm over their dumbass bickering, so I tell Gabby to leave his ass in the car, and I open my door. She does the same, and after Gabby and I are already headed up the path, I hear Zach‚Äôs door open as well. He jogs to catch up. ‚ÄúI was just messing with you guys. Jesus,‚Äù he lies.

The man who answers the door has curly salt and pepper hair and five o‚Äôclock shadow. He looks like Mark Ruffalo on a steady diet of Long John Silver‚Äôs and whippits. He‚Äôs at least fifteen years older than us, so I wait for Gabby to ask if his son is home and if he can come out to play, but instead the man smiles, and all of a sudden I know what‚Äôs going on. By the confusion on Zach‚Äôs face, I can tell he‚Äôs still in the dark. 

‚ÄúCome on in!‚Äù the old dude roars, waving us inside. 

I scan the house while Gabby and the dude shoot the shit. Zach is looking around like something‚Äôs going to jump out at him. The dealer‚Äôs place is small, and there is a lot of shit packed in it, but it‚Äôs pretty tidy. A neat row of bowls and cups is drying next to the kitchen sink. He has like six or seven acoustic guitars mounted on a wall in the living room, and across from a long leather sofa is an easel and a blank canvas.

The old dude sighs dramatically. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much, but wait till you see the basement.‚Äù He turns and opens a door that leads downstairs. I catch a cold whiff of mothballs.  

Zach shoots a look at Gabby and then at the dealer. ‚ÄúYeah...can‚Äôt we just chill up here? We kinda gotta be somewhere.‚Äù

The man laughs and claps Zach‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúOohhh. I get it. Skittish, huh? Didn‚Äôt Gabby tell you who I am? We go way back. I was her camp counselor when she was just a snotty little rugrat - Christopher.‚Äù The man extends his hand, but by the look on Zach‚Äôs face, I can tell he‚Äôs still fuming from the back slap.

I‚Äôm not trying to see a fight, and I really want to get high, so I diffuse the tension by taking the man‚Äôs hand and introducing myself. His skin is rough like an old dog‚Äôs paw. The man smiles, but I notice something fucked up with his face when he does this, like he‚Äôs trying too hard to look normal. Zach tries to grab Gabby‚Äôs arm when she starts to follow Christopher into the basement, but when he sees that I am already two steps ahead of both of them, he lets go. I hear Zach make some bitter remark to Gabby, but he follows us because he‚Äôs a pussy. Christopher flips a switch, and the basement walls explode with fluorescence. Every single square inch of wallspace is covered with some kind of black light design. 

On one wall, plumes of purple smoke hang over a forest of mushrooms. On the opposite wall, a mermaid with comically large tits wrestles a giant octopus. Black light posters cover the remaining wallspace. Two overstuffed couches face each other in the center of the room. Between them is a rectangular glass coffee table. Resting on the table, in the exact center of the room, is the most ridiculous bong I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs like four feet tall with like four bomb ass percolators, some crazy bubbler thing I‚Äôd never seen, and a piece for doing dabs. The beast must have cost at least five hundred dollars.   

‚ÄúDid you paint these?‚Äù Gabby asks, walking up to the mermaid.

‚ÄúLong time ago,‚Äù Christopher sighs, trying to sound like he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about them. ‚ÄúTruth be told, the composition isn‚Äôt all that great. Not much I can do about that now, I suppose.‚Äù Christopher asks everyone to have a seat. Gabby sits next to him. Zach and I sit on the opposite sofa.

‚ÄúSo!‚Äù Christopher shouts, smacking both of his knees (Zach flinches). ‚ÄúHow long have you kids been smoking grass?‚Äù For a second, I think he‚Äôs about to give us one of those super hypocritical ‚Äúcome to Jesus‚Äù talks. I‚Äôm relieved when he pulls out a jar packed with sticky blue-green buds. He transfers a portion of the stash into a medicine vial and hands it to Gabby.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to weigh it?‚Äù Zach asks flatly. 

‚ÄúZach,‚Äù Gabby hisses.

Christopher smirks. ‚ÄúYou guys asked for an eighth. That‚Äôs about a quad, and I‚Äôm asking for thirty-five. I call that a favor.‚Äù

Zach scowls and peels two twenties from his lame ass money clip. Christopher winks at me, and again I get the feeling that there‚Äôs something really off with him, but I can‚Äôt tell whether or not he‚Äôs hitting on me, or if that‚Äôs even the problem.  
Christopher grinds a bud and packs a heaping bowl while he rambles on about the first time he got high and how it changed his life ‚Äúcreatively and spiritually.‚Äù Nobody is listening to him, not even Gabby. We‚Äôre all staring at the bong and wondering how the hell it works. 

‚ÄúNowadays, grass is just another thing people use to get by. Not like it used to be. Used to be grass was god, but I suppose that was before I discovered acid at Woodstock in ‚Äò99. Man. If I could go back...I would take all of you, and I would show you what real music sounds like. I haven‚Äôt been to a show like that in fifteen years! Damn. I used to be hot shit, too. I wore Doc Martens, baby, and I actually looked good in them. Imagine that. Now I work for UPS and sell dope to kids. What a trip, right?‚Äù 

God, I marvel, I‚Äôve never heard someone use so many words to say absolutely nothing.

He finally stops talking long enough to take a massive rip off the bong. I‚Äôve never seen such a big hit, and he doesn‚Äôt even cough. He passes the bong to Gabby and keeps talking. Gabby handles the bong the way a toddler might tote a twelve-gauge, but she manages to get a decent rip. She sets the bong on the table and leans back. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù she utters from the back of her throat - her words drowned in smoke.

Zach reaches for the bong, hesitates, then motions for me to go ahead. The tube is so thick that I can‚Äôt wrap my fingers around it all the way. The thing is heavy, too, so I hold on tight as I place the bong on the floor between my knees. It‚Äôs still rolling, so I put my mouth to the tube and inhale slowly for a couple of seconds before I pull the stem. All of the thick yellow smoke that had accumulated in the tube rushes into my lungs, but I don‚Äôt feel a tug in my chest. It goes down smooth, and my face is numb before all the smoke has left my mouth.

I look up and see that Christopher is staring at me again. Now that I‚Äôm stoned, his face looks creepy as hell. The furrow in his brow and cheeks looks too dark, and his eyes are deep and dead. I think he is talking to me, but I can‚Äôt hear him. His voice is broken and bubbly, like we‚Äôre under water or something. I move my mouth, but no words come out. Zach grabs my shoulder, and everything bursts into focus, louder and brighter than before.

‚ÄúI need to go to the bathroom,‚Äù Gabby announces to no one. 

Christopher jumps off the couch so fast that Zach jerks forward a little. I can feel his tension in the springs of the sofa.  ‚ÄúWhat kind of host am I? Let me show you where it is.‚Äù Gabby looks a little wobbly as Christopher helps her off the couch. They go upstairs. Christopher rambles the whole time about property taxes.

‚ÄúThis place is creepy as fuck,‚Äù Zach whispers, even though Christopher is out of earshot. 

‚ÄúHe is creepy as fuck.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm like...so...just, high, dude. I feel like I foamed my jeans. That‚Äôs some weapons-grade shit, man. What the fuck.‚Äù 

Zach‚Äôs face looks like a slab of pork. His mouth is hanging open, and his eyes look like they‚Äôre bleeding. I hadn‚Äôt even realized that he‚Äôd taken a hit. It would be funny if I didn‚Äôt feel the same way. My throat is raw. I notice an old nicotine-stained fridge hulking under the stairs. I point to it. ‚ÄúGrab me a water or something. This cottonmouth is killing me.‚Äù 

Zach looks at the fridge like it‚Äôs guarded by Rottweilers and concertina wire.

‚ÄúNah...‚Äù He rasps, ‚ÄúGet it yourself.‚Äù 

I kick his shoe and grunt. He cusses at me and peels himself off the couch. I light a cigarette and stare at the giant bong. The bowl is still smoking. The thing looks like a goddamn nuclear silo. 

I see a jerky movement out of the corner of my eye. ‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù Zach says, staring into the jaws of the fridge. ‚ÄúWe need to get the fuck out of here.‚Äù 

I walk over to the fridge and peer over Zach‚Äôs shoulder. A few cans of beer, a take-out box, and a jug of orange juice sit on the top shelf. Beneath that is a large glass jar filled with amber fluid. A pale stem of flesh floats in the liquid. It has ten tiny toes, ten tiny fingers, and two tiny heads. The smell of formaldehyde penetrates my nostrils and grips my throat. Holy shit - is that fucking real?

Zach slams the refrigerator closed, and we pound up the stairs. There‚Äôs no sign of Gabby or Christopher up there, and for a second, I‚Äôm sure that he‚Äôs already chopped her up and wrapped her in a tarp. Then I hear a muffled giggle coming from a room at the end of the hall. I wave Zach over. He twists the knob, but the door is locked.

‚ÄúHold the fuck on!‚Äù Christopher shouts, his ‚Äúchill dude‚Äù facade no longer intact.

‚ÄúI hear you, Gabby,‚Äù I scream. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of there. It‚Äôs time to go.‚Äù 

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù Christopher hesitates. ‚ÄúI think she went out to the car to grab smokes. Why don‚Äôt you guys head back downstairs?‚Äù 

I hear Zach mutter something nasty between his teeth. He rears back and kicks the door. The impact is heavy, and I hear a splintering noise. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù Christopher screams. He sounds shrill and insane, like he‚Äôs suddenly turned into Mr. Hyde. Zach kicks again, and the door bursts open. Gabby is tripping over her jeans and trying to cover her tits at the same time. Christopher is just standing there, butt-ass naked. His muscles are bulging, and he is sucking air like a bull. A thick blanket of dark hair covers his body head-to-toe. Under a mass of tangled pubes, bobs his tiny penis that looks like a redskin potato gone to seed. Zach swings first, but misses. Christopher pops him with a blunt force jab to the gut. They both go down. I grab Gabby‚Äôs wrist and yank her out of the bathroom. 

Zach and Christopher are wrestling on the floor, smearing blood all over the linoleum. Zach is strong, but he‚Äôs lean, and it‚Äôs obvious that Christopher has the power advantage. He rolls on top of Zach and starts pounding his face with his forearms like an ape. Christopher is wheezing and crying. Zach is doing his best to block Christopher‚Äôs blows, but I can tell he‚Äôs not going to last. I sprint down the stairs, stuff the jar of weed in my hoodie pocket, and heave the mammoth bong upstairs. I lug it to the end of the hall. Zach and Christopher are still struggling on the floor, but my movement at the door catches Christopher‚Äôs attention. He turns to face me, and when he does, I swing the bong by the tube as hard as I can. The base cracks Christopher in the right eye. Glass, blood, ash, and yellow bong water explode all over the wallpaper. Christopher goes limp. His naked body collapses on top of Zach. Gabby screams at us from the front door to hurry the fuck up. Zach pushes Christopher‚Äôs body off of him, and all three of us book it down the cobblestone walkway and into the truck. Zach slides into the passenger seat and tosses the keys to me. 

We drive in silence for a long time. I keep turning left and right until I don‚Äôt recognize any buildings or signs.  

Zach is holding a Milwaukee‚Äôs Best against his cheek. His white Affliction tee shirt is splotchy with bong water and Christopher‚Äôs blood. Gabby is smoking a cigarette. She‚Äôs wearing an old football jersey that she found stuffed behind the seat. Her face is pink. ‚ÄúDid anyone grab the weed?‚Äù She asks. There is a long pause. Someone should probably be yelling at someone, I think. There should be outraged questions and accusations. Someone‚Äôs feelings should be hurt. We should be more terrified of Christopher, of that fucking thing in the fridge, of our own depravity. 

Instead, I take the jar out of my pocket and toss it to Gabby in the backseat. She breaks down a nugget on her lap, pinches the tobacco out of a cigarette, and carefully fills the empty tube with Christopher‚Äôs weed. She packs the contents down with a bobby pin, twists the tip, and bites the filter off. She flicks her lighter, pauses, and gives the spliff to Zach instead. He looks back at her and smirks. 

‚ÄúWacky tobacky,‚Äù he says, doing his best Goofy impression.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Gabby hisses.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I say, irritated.

‚ÄúWe forgot to pay him.‚Äù 

Zach‚Äôs laugh turns into a dry cough. I look at Gabby in the rearview mirror. She‚Äôs grinning like an idiot. I just shake my head and take the spliff from Zach. I try to keep Zach‚Äôs truck between the lines, but I‚Äôm so stoned that I can barely tell where the lines are or what the fuck they even mean.

1mcuudu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1mcuudu/so_much_guilt/,So much guilt...,"I lost my older brother David at the end of January this year. He was 54, a functioning alcoholic Australian Army veteran.

We had a falling out about 4 years ago over family stuff, and the only contact we really had was just a yearly happy birthday text.

In early January,  I decided to try and sort our issues out. I messaged him and told him how I felt, and he was genuinely happy to hear from me. I sent him some recent photos of my kids, and he seemed to be genuinely grateful. 

He'd spoken to our dad a week later and said he'd be happy to have a meet up and let the past go.

On the 29th of January,  my dad called... David had been found deceased on his kitchen floor by our younger brother. Apparently he'd had a heart attack in the early hours of the morning.

I now carry so much guilt that I didn't try and make amends with him sooner... Also, our younger brother now treats me like an outsider, even though I'm now on good terms with my parents. He has told me our relationship will never be what it was, although he's happy to have the occasional coffee at a Cafe with me.

How do I get past this? I didn't actually start the argument, (my mother did, and it was about my wife) but my brothers took my mother's side.

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I guess I just need to get it off my chest.

Rest in Peace, David. I love you Bro. üíî",2,1753842479.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I feel like I watched them together during the same show, but they might be different programs.

A photographers wife/girlfriend is worried she is aging and afraid her husband/boyfriend will leave her for one of his younger models.

She spends a fortune, writes him a check, and begins drinking the water only to discover that for every year it takes off that day, it doubles them back the next day.

The last scene is of both of them in the 70‚Äôs or 80‚Äôs drinking coffee at their kitchen table. Apparently, he drinks the magical water so that he ages also and they can be old together. 

Second Story Plot

One demon says that the devil has had him out committed atrocities night and day and he‚Äôs incredibly tired of being on earth. The second demon said the devil had him marry a beautiful young woman, give her the best years of her life, then when they were old decades later, he had to leave her and say terrible things to her so that she committed suicide.

I am an experienced civil structural engineer and BIM professional who just finished the University of Adelaide's Master of Construction Management with first-class honors. My experience (overseas) spans both civil and industrial projects, and I even worked for a US Fortune 500 company.

I got job offers from other states through online applications, but Adelaide just seems to work differently...

I've spoken with dozens of international professionals here, and mostly none got a job here through job boards. I'm realizing that Adelaide's construction industry works mostly through connections. I, myself, prefer to talk to a real person rather than depending on the black box that ATSs are.

Therefore, I'd like to expand my network by speaking with some of you working in Adelaide's construction/civil engineering industry; happy to invite you for a coffee chat. Any advice you can give me, direction, or potential connections who might be hiring would be useful.

The role's salary is the least of my concerns. What I care about most is getting local experience, working relentlessly hard (extensively proven by my experience), and finally breaking into Adelaide's market.

Feel free to send me a DM, thanks!

PD1: I have full working rights. Due to visa purposes, I need my job to be based in South Australia (regional included).

PD2: Some of the roles I'm interested in: estimator, project engineer, quantity surveyor, structural engineer, BIM engineer/drafter",0,1753842429.0,Adelaide,2,0.43,False

I am a 29‚Äëyear‚Äëold Non‚ÄëBinary Male CEO who is Sub-Leaning and looking for a high‚Äëquality Domme (someone who is a good fit).

Based out of Melbourne, Australia (GMT+10). IRL would be good to have but not too fussy and happy with Online Dynamic, especially if you are based in Europe or North America. I am looking to relocate sometime in next 1-3 years.

Happy to verify through social meet or video call before starting to play, but happy and eager to keep our identities and professional lives private until trust is developed. 

If You resonate with the advert, DM with these three things

* A brief intro (Age, Location, Work Life basics)
* Sexual and gender orientation, kinks, limits
* What did you like about my femdom personnel
* Availability for a no‚Äëplay coffee / videocall meet.

**Professional Life**

In my professional life, I present as mostly masculine and am someone who always takes responsibility, pushes boundaries, gets shit done, meets very important people, and solves hard, complex problems. My day‚Äëto‚Äëday job duties include managing multiple projects and teams, setting company strategy, meeting with company boards, analysing the bigger picture of markets and the economy, pitching proposals to boards and investors, securing contracts, devising solutions to complex problems, and implementing them.

Hence, I not only work a lot, but the job is also super stressful‚Äîyet I find it very, very rewarding. It‚Äôs not as fancy as you might imagine; I would still define my company as a startup.

If you‚Äôve watched the BDSM‚Äëthemed TV series Billions, you can think of me as ‚ÄúBobby Axelrod‚Äù in terms of business life but with the sexuality and femdom kinks of ‚ÄúChuck Rhodes,‚Äù looking for my ‚ÄúWendy.‚Äù

**Personal Life**

I have quite a bit of a feminine side as well. I take care of myself and nurture my wellbeing‚Äîquite a bit of a diva who loves skincare, haircare, fashion, jewellery, and so on. When not in a professional setting, my appearance is often unisex with shades of femininity‚Äîor simply masculine.

I‚Äôm very into fitness, health, wellbeing, nutrition, spirituality, learning, self‚Äëdevelopment, and growth‚Äîyour typical Type‚ÄëA personality. However, if I‚Äôm starting to sound boring, just hold on.

I also love food and cooking (trying new restaurants and cuisines), music (classical, experimental, pop), movies and cinema, travelling, meeting new people, art, design, nature, hiking, mountains, and so on.

**Sexual Life**

In my sexual life, I am a sub‚Äëleaning switch, with a focus on sub. Sometimes I like to be vanilla and enjoy real‚Äëlife intimacy, or have the tables turned so I take control (which happens once in a blue moon). However, this all depends on the other person‚Äôs preferences‚Äîwhere we click and find a dynamic that works for both of us.

I have always been attracted to strong women who are Domme/Top/masculine. For me, that applies to her day‚Äëto‚Äëday life and sexuality. I‚Äôm not into hyper‚Äëfeminine women, but someone who takes control of her life, body, and situations. This doesn‚Äôt mean I want you to play that part in every aspect of our relationship.

**Ideal Woman**

* Someone who is into fitness and is big/tall/strong physically, as I am passionate about fitness myself and have a thing for fitness models. I admire functional strength, discipline and love for one's body. It‚Äôs a plus if you‚Äôre into wrestling‚Äîwhether you have training or simply enjoy it within a femdom frame.
* Someone who is genuinely competent in life and has some real‚Äëworld power. Ideally, you run your own business or have a good job, are ambitious, and are driven toward your work, personal development, growth, and financial independence‚Äîso you‚Äôll understand my lifestyle.
* Someone who is self‚Äëaware, mature, and has a decent amount of self‚Äëlove. It is important that you are aware of your desires, limits, and needs, and that you take responsibility for them‚Äîwhether through therapy, journalling, or meditation. After a certain point, it‚Äôs our responsibility to own our baggage, beliefs, projections, and dogmas. This comes with maturity and self‚Äëcare.
* You should have some understanding, knowledge, and experience of safe BDSM practices, consent, aftercare, boundaries, basic respect for everyone, empathy, etc. You have already explored your Dom side, learned about it, and are not just starting to experiment.

**Ideal Dynamic / Relationship**

In the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm looking to play only with someone for whom I can see a glimmer of a future and am therefore not into ONS or a kink‚Äëdispenser dynamic. However, from the get‚Äëgo, I‚Äôm not looking to jump into something super serious, as I‚Äôve just gotten out of a long‚Äëterm relationship where incompatibility of lifestyle, sexual preferences, and essence was a big factor. Hence, I‚Äôm looking to take things slowly.

I value honesty, respect, boundaries, humour, growth‚Äëmindset. 

Slower doesn‚Äôt mean casual and shallow‚ÄîI struggle to do that. I‚Äôm looking for a genuine connection‚Äîtrust, respect, empathy‚Äîwhere both people can play safely and be vulnerable. I‚Äôll be honest: while I‚Äôm not looking for a kink dispenser, femdom is something I do sometimes feel I can use to help regulate myself after the professional life I lead. In fact, I believe that, if done right, femdom should empower both parties and help them become better versions of themselves in everyday life. Mention ""Django"" in the DM so that I know you have read the personnel fully.

There‚Äôs some research I‚Äôve done that might help you understand me, alongside my desires and needs:

* Escape‚Äëfrom‚Äëself relief: Baumeister‚Äôs classic ‚Äúmasochism as escape from self‚Äù model shows that surrendering control can temporarily silence self‚Äëmonitoring and responsibility overload‚Äîespecially attractive to high‚Äëpressure professionals.
* Compensation vs. congruence: Studies of CEOs, military officers, and surgeons find two patterns:
   * Compensation: power at work ‚Üí desire to yield in bed (off‚Äëduty switch). I fall into this category.
   * Congruence: men with low workplace autonomy fantasise about dominance to restore agency.
* High sensation‚Äëseeking: Novelty lovers gravitate to extremes of the power spectrum for stronger arousal peaks.

**Kinks / Desires**

Wrestling, Face Sitting, Scissoring, Cunnilingus, Body Worship, Foot Worship, Massages, Tease and Denial, Chastity, Begging, JOI, Ruined Orgasms, Edging, Being Used Sexually, Spanking, Pegging, Prostate Play, Gentle Femdom, Mommy Dom, Bondage and Restraint, Multiple Orgasms (giving and receiving), Nipple Play, Light CBT, Queening, Shibari, Acts of Service

Jade Cargill vs Alexa Bliss

The match begins with Alexa playing mind games, circling Jade and smirking, even sitting on the middle rope inviting her in.

Jade overpowers Bliss early, tossing her across the ring with a huge fallaway slam and a military press that gets the crowd fired up.

Bliss uses quick strikes and a well-timed DDT to slow Jade down, nearly getting a near-fall after a snap DDT.

Jade absorbs Bliss‚Äôs offense and comes back strong, nailing a pump kick followed by her finisher, Jaded, for the win.

Jade stands tall, helping the referee raise her hand. Bliss sits in the corner smirking, almost amused by the loss‚Äîshowing no frustration. Suddenly, the crowd erupts as Charlotte Flair slides into the ring from behind and blasts Jade with a chop block to the leg.

Charlotte stomps away mercilessly, then hits Natural Selection, standing over Jade with a smug grin. She mouths, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not on my level.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Bliss calmly rolls out of the ring, leans against the barricade, and just watches the attack‚Äîhead tilted, that eerie little smile still on her face. She never helps, never interferes. Just‚Ä¶ observes.

Charlotte exits up the ramp with her arms raised, leaving Jade glaring from the mat as the tension builds. Bliss gives one last glance at Jade and Charlotte before slowly walking up through the crowd without a word.

Bayley vs. Raquel Rodriguez

The match starts with Raquel overpowering Bayley early, using shoulder blocks and a big boot to send Bayley to the outside.

Bayley stalls at ringside, jawing with the crowd, before luring Raquel in and driving her into the steel steps.

Back in the ring, Bayley targets Raquel‚Äôs knee, repeatedly slamming it into the mat and locking in a single-leg crab.

Raquel powers out and hits a fallaway slam followed by a spinning elbow in the corner, shifting the momentum.

Bayley avoids the Texana Bomb by raking Raquel‚Äôs eyes, then sends her face-first into the turnbuckle.

Bayley hits the Rose Plant out of nowhere for the win.

After the match, Bayley smirks into the camera and mouths, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when you step to a Role Model.‚Äù

The screen opens on a golden sunset over crashing waves. Sol Ruca is sitting on her surfboard in the sand, wearing athletic gear and a laid-back smile. Her voice plays over clips of her training‚Äîflips off gym equipment, surf tricks, ladder drills in the Performance Center.

Sol Ruca (V.O.):
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been chasing waves my whole life. Surfing taught me balance, taught me timing. Gymnastics taught me precision. And every single day since I laced up these boots, I‚Äôve been building something bigger than a career‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been building this moment.‚Äù

Cut to Sol doing ladder drills in slow motion, sweat dripping, determination in her eyes.

Sol:
‚ÄúPeople see me and they say, ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs flashy. She‚Äôs fun.‚Äô And yeah‚Ä¶ I am. But behind every flip, every highlight‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs work. Hours nobody saw. Sacrifices nobody felt but me.‚Äù

Clips flash of her lifting in the gym, wiping chalk off her hands, running the ropes.

Sol (smiling now):
‚ÄúAnd now‚Ä¶ Money in the Bank. A ladder match with some of the best in the world. Becky Lynch. Kairi Sane. Liv Morgan. Raquel Rodriguez. Thunder Rosa. Six women fighting for one opportunity.‚Äù

She stands, holding her surfboard like a ladder, looking out at the horizon.

Thunder Rosa vs Tiffany Stratton

Thunder Rosa came out with fire, unloading on Tiffany Stratton with chops and a running knee strike that nearly scored an early pinfall.

Tiffany regained control by yanking Rosa into the turnbuckle and hitting a rolling senton into a standing moonsault for two.

Rosa rallied with a clothesline flurry and nailed a basement dropkick, setting up for the Fire Thunder Driver.

Tiffany slipped out and distracted the referee by faking a knee injury, then grabbed the ropes during a surprise roll-up for the cheap three-count.

After the bell, Tiffany strutted and mocked Rosa, then blindsided her with a forearm before grabbing a steel chair.

Before Tiffany could swing, World Women‚Äôs Champion Stephanie Vaquer‚Äôs music hit‚Äîthe champion stormed the ring, forcing Tiffany to drop the chair and bail out.

Tiffany backed up the ramp, smirking while Vaquer stood tall, checking on Rosa and holding her title high as the final warning before Money in the Bank.

1mcunnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mcunnm/chronic_headache/,Chronic headache,"38m 6‚Äô 280lbs


High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained. I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).


Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It‚Äôs been a long and frustrating journey. Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven‚Äôt shown anything interesting.


I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus. No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I‚Äôm laying down. I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior.


Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy.


I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck. I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever.


The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms. I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS. 

Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.).


After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.). Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement. They referred me for a sleep study. Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms. The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch.


Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn‚Äôt show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted.

The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair). Results showed very minor defects in vestibular function and I was referred for vestibular physical therapy. Completed ~6 months of rehab and didn‚Äôt notice any improvement of symptoms. BPPV and vestibular migraines were ruled out. 

There may be additional testing/treatment I‚Äôm forgetting at the moment. I took a break from treatment and visits for the last ~6 months because I was honestly exhausted from all the appointments and lack of answers. But I‚Äôm ready to start up again and would like to find ways to either improve quality of life despite the symptoms (already doing CBT to address this), or actually get answers/ improve symptoms (daring to dream here).


I guess my question is‚Ä¶. Where the hell do I go from here? Is going back to the headache clinic at the academic medical center the right thing? Do I go back and see a neurologist again? Do I try and find some other resource?",1,1753841937.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

# Best Countertop Protection Film 2025: Expert Buying Guide

Countertop protection film is an essential product for homeowners and businesses alike. These films provide a barrier against scratches, stains, heat, and other potential damages, preserving the beauty and longevity of countertops made from various materials like granite, marble, quartz, wood, and laminate. With the diverse range of options available on the market, selecting the right countertop protection film can be a daunting task. This expert buying guide will provide a comprehensive overview of the best countertop protection films in 2025, focusing on key features, benefits, and considerations too help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and effectiveness of countertop protection film hinges on several key characteristics. Understanding these features is critical for selecting a product that meets your specific needs and protects your countertops.

**material Composition:** the core material dictates the film's durability,heat resistance,and clarity.

Most countertop protection films are made from Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polyurethane (PU), or Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). PET films are known for their clarity and scratch resistance, making them ideal for countertops where aesthetics are a priority. PU films offer superior adaptability and heat resistance, suitable for areas exposed to hot pots and pans. PVC films, while less expensive are generally less durable and may contain chemicals some users wish to avoid. The best films use high-grade materials with a focus on non-toxicity and longevity.

**Thickness:** The thickness of the film greatly influences its protective capabilities.

Thickness, measured in mils (thousandths of an inch), determines the level of protection against scratches, impacts, and heat. Thicker films generally offer better protection but may be less flexible and more challenging to install. A thickness between 4 to 8 mils is usually sufficient for most household applications, providing a good balance between protection and ease of use. For commercial settings or high-traffic areas, thicker films might be preferable.**Adhesive Properties:** the adhesive is a critical factor in the film‚Äôs ability to adhere to the countertop surface securely and consistently.

High-quality countertop protection films utilize adhesives that provide strong adhesion without leaving residue upon removal. Acrylic-based adhesives are commonly used for their balance of adhesion strength and clean removability. The adhesive should be resistant to water and cleaning solutions to prevent peeling or bubbling over time. Some films also feature air release channels in the adhesive layer to simplify installation and prevent air bubbles from forming.

**Heat Resistance:** Countertops near cooking areas require film with excellent heat resistance to prevent damage from hot cookware.

The film‚Äôs ability to withstand high temperatures without warping, melting, or discoloration is crucial, especially near stoves and ovens. High-quality PU films can typically withstand temperatures up to 200-250¬∞F (93-121¬∞C) for short periods. It's important to check the manufacturer's specifications for heat resistance to ensure the film is suitable for your specific countertop usage.

**UV Protection:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fading and discoloration of countertops.

UV protection is a valuable feature for films intended for countertops exposed to direct sunlight. UV inhibitors in the film help block harmful UV rays, preventing fading and discoloration of the countertop material and the film itself. this extends the lifespan of both the countertop and the protective film, maintaining their original appearance.**Finish and Clarity:** The film's finish should complement the countertop's existing aesthetic.

Countertop protection films come in various finishes, including glossy, matte, and textured. Glossy films enhance the countertop's shine and are ideal for enhancing a sleek, modern look. Matte films reduce glare and fingerprints, making them suitable for high-traffic areas and families with children. Textured films frequently enough mimic the look and feel of natural stone, providing both protection and aesthetic enhancement.Ideally, the film should be clear enough not to distort the countertop's original color and pattern.

## Core benefits

Countertop protection film offers numerous practical benefits that make it a valuable investment for protecting and maintaining countertops. These benefits contribute to the aesthetics, longevity, and cost-effectiveness of your countertops.

**Protection Against Scratches and Scuffs:** Countertop protection film acts as a shield against everyday wear and tear, preventing scratches and scuffs from damaging the surface.

Everyday activities like sliding dishes, cutting vegetables, and placing appliances can cause scratches and scuffs on countertops. Applying a protective film creates a barrier that absorbs these impacts, keeping the countertop surface pristine. This is especially beneficial for soft materials like marble and wood,which are more susceptible to damage.**Stain Resistance:** The non-porous nature of countertop protection film prevents spills and stains from penetrating the countertop surface.

Liquids like wine, coffee, and oil can quickly stain porous countertop materials like granite and marble. The film creates a waterproof barrier that prevents these liquids from seeping into the countertop, making cleanup easy and preventing permanent staining. This is notably useful in kitchens and bathrooms where spills are common.

**Heat Protection:** High-quality films can withstand moderate heat, protecting countertops from damage caused by hot pots and pans.

Placing hot cookware directly on countertops can cause discoloration, cracking, or even melting, especially with less durable materials. Heat-resistant countertop protection films can withstand temperatures up to a certain point, providing a buffer that prevents heat damage. This is a convenient way to protect countertops without constantly relying on trivets or hot pads.

**easy Maintenance:** Countertop protection film simplifies cleaning and maintenance.

Wiping down spills and grime is much easier on a smooth, non-porous film compared to the raw countertop surface. The film prevents dirt and liquids from adhering to the countertop, making cleanup quick and effortless. this reduces the need for harsh cleaning chemicals and time-consuming maintenance routines.

**Preservation of countertop Aesthetics:** Clear, high-quality films maintain the natural beauty of the countertop without altering its appearance.

A well-chosen countertop protection film should be virtually invisible once applied, allowing the countertop's original color, pattern, and texture to shine through. This is particularly important for high-end countertops like granite and marble, where the natural beauty is a key selling point. Preserving the aesthetic appeal enhances the countertop's value and ensures it remains a focal point in the room.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions helps consumers understand the practicalities and limitations of countertop protection film, enabling them to make informed choices.

**Can countertop protection film be applied to any type of countertop material?**
Generally, yes, countertop protection film can be applied to various materials including granite, marble, quartz, wood, laminate, and stainless steel. However, it's crucial to choose a film specifically designed for the type of countertop to ensure optimal adhesion and performance. For porous materials like unfinished wood or certain types of natural stone, sealing the countertop before applying the film might potentially be recommended.

**How long does countertop protection film typically last?**
The lifespan of countertop protection film depends on the quality of the film, the level of traffic, and the care taken during cleaning. High-quality films can last anywhere from 1 to 5 years or even longer with proper maintenance. Regularly cleaning the film with mild soap and water and avoiding harsh chemicals can extend its durability. Scratches, tears, or discoloration may indicate it‚Äôs time for replacement.

**Is it difficult to remove countertop protection film, and does it leave residue?**
Removing countertop protection film can be relatively easy if applied and removed correctly. High-quality films with acrylic-based adhesives are designed to be removable without leaving residue. Applying heat from a hairdryer can soften the adhesive, making removal easier. However, it's essential to slowly peel off the film at a gradual angle to avoid damaging the countertop surface. If any residue remains, it can usually be removed with a mild adhesive remover or isopropyl alcohol.

**Will countertop protection film prevent all types of damage?**
While countertop protection film provides excellent safeguards against scratches, stains, and moderate heat, it's not a foolproof solution against all types of damage. extremely sharp objects can still penetrate the film, and excessive heat exposure can cause warping or melting.Similarly,harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners can damage the film's surface. Therefore, it's still important to exercise caution and avoid exposing the countertop to extreme conditions.

1mcujcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1mcujcj/42f_night_time_heart_rate_spikes_and_shaking/,42F ‚Äì night time heart rate spikes and shaking,"I‚Äôm a 42-year-old female and have been dealing with a range of symptoms for the past 7 months that I cannot figure out. I've tried to summarise everything below, but feel free to ask follow up questions if that will help with an answer.

It all started with some light spotting on about Day 8 of my period, about a year ago. Two transvaginal ultrasounds (latest Jan/Feb 2025) found nothing concerning. My periods are regular (25 day cycle), but light. I still get the spotting, always at the same point in my cycle, but have just accepted that this is my cycle now. I had a contraceptive implant in for 5 years, had that taken out July 2024.

Then, after some rectal bleeding during my period in January 2025, I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Colonoscopy found only hemorrhoids. I continue to have this bleeding, but ONLY during my period. An incidental gastric lesion during the endoscopy was initially misdiagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumour, but biopsy confirmed as a benign pancreatic rest. During the course of investigating this, I had an abdominal ultrasound, and CT of my abdomen and pelvis, which revealed nothing else of concern - we discovered I have only one kidney though!

To cope with the stress of being misdiagnosed with cancer, I attempted to start a course of Lexapro. I took one 10mg tablet on the morning of March 23rd, then woke up early hours of March 24th with my first panic attack ever - impending doom, racing heart, full body shaking, cold sweats, pins and needles in right leg. I ended up in ER, where they did a head and neck CT. The only thing found was a thyroid nodule. A thyroid ultrasound revealed the nodule to be a 2.4 cm upper right-lobe nodule, TI-RADS 4 (solid, hypoechoic, no other concerning features), no abnormal lymph nodes. Left lobe is severely atrophied (two thyroid specialists suspect congenital asymmetry; one suggested possible Hashimoto‚Äôs). It's been biopsied twice - Bethesda I, then Bethesda III, and I have a third biopsy tomorrow. I had a full thyroid panel, including antibodies, which was all normal.

Now to my current symptoms...

For the past 4 months (after the first panic attack), I've been waking up 2‚Äì3 nights per week around 1‚Äì3am with a racing heart (around 90 bpm) and full-body shaking. These episodes last about 15 minutes. Initially I was feeling panicked when they happened, but now I'm used to it, and I'm able to resolve them with calm breathing. In the last month, they've been happening more often. Last night's was particularly odd, I had 3 episodes about 2-3hrs apart, and in the last one, I felt blood rushing to my genitals, followed by a ""spicy"" dream, which is very out of character for me.

During the daytime, I feel completely fine, apart from fatigued, and occasional palpitations in the evening when I'm quietly reading before going to sleep. The fatigue feels more 'eyes and head' tired than physical fatigue. I'm still exercising 5-6 days a week, hitting PBs, feeling strong in my muscles etc, but I just always feel like I could close my eyes at any time. When I exercise, my heart responds normally and recovers quickly. At no time have I had chest pain, shortness of breath, or sweating. I've visited ER 3 times with this (most recent was May 2025). My ECGs and bloodwork are always normal.

This is having a significant impact on my life. The anticipatory anxiety of 'will it happen tonight?' is very draining. My GP has dismissed all of this as anxiety, but I'm concerned that these episodes are happening more often, despite lifestyle improvements (diet, exercise, stress management). I eat a balanced, low-GI diet of unprocessed foods (have cut out all refined sugar, so not even experiencing the joy of a small sweet treat!), don't drink alcohol, don't smoke/vape, don't drink coffee or consume excess caffeine from other sources, the only medication/supplement I use is an asthma inhaler. I exercise in the morning (brisk walking most days of the week, strength training 2-3 times a week). No screens before bed, quiet reading or colouring in only. I see a psychologist for my anxiety and can honestly say it currently feels well-controlled. I'm doing my PhD, which has been very stressful over the past 2.5 years, but I am managing the stress of that better now, and am now finding my work rewarding and a saving grace amidst all this uncertainty. I'm married with a 6.5 yo daughter who is a delight but also a challenge, so I have a bit going on, but I've been working hard at managing the stress of it all.

So, my question is - what's causing this? Given my completely normal tests and imaging, I'm landing back at things like perimenopause/anxiety, but I'm concerned that these episodes are happening more often, despite managing the lifestyle factors that contribute to peri/anxiety.",1,1753841596.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

Hi. I‚Äôm Evan (22, TM). This is the first time I‚Äôm posting on Reddit since I got on the app a week ago. I‚Äôm feeling really guilty and confused right now I need some advice/opinions. 

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend, Julian (28M), for 8 months, and he‚Äôs honestly amazing most of the time. I‚Äôm pretty new to serious relationships, and sometimes I worry I‚Äôm not good enough for him. Last night, we had a fight, and I ended up leaving his place to stay with a friend. I feel like I overreacted, but I‚Äôm also kinda hurt, and I need help figuring out if I‚Äôm the asshole here.

So, a bit about us: I‚Äôm a part-time barista and studying graphic design at community college. I‚Äôm still figuring out life as a trans guy, and Julian‚Äôs been super supportive and a loving boyfriend. Sometimes he evens offers to help cover my T costs when I‚Äôm strapped for cash or checking in to make sure I‚Äôm okay. He‚Äôs charming, has a solid marketing job, and he‚Äôs always caring, always planning cute dates or making sure I‚Äôm eating when I‚Äôm stressed out. But sometimes he gets‚Ä¶ overly protective? Like, he‚Äôll ask a ton of questions about who I‚Äôm with, where I‚Äôm going or say things like, ‚ÄúI just want you to be safe/you‚Äôre too trusting.‚Äù At first, I thought it was sweet, but lately, it feels a bit overbearing, like I can‚Äôt move without him needing to know.

Anyway the fight happened two days ago and happened was: I posted an instagram story of me grabbing coffee with my friend Bruno (24M), who‚Äôs also my ex from a couple years ago(we dated briefly for a year ish and now we‚Äôre just friends who catch up sometimes) My insta story was literally just us holding coffee cups and I captioned it ‚Äúcaffeine catch-up.‚Äù which I thought was totally harmless but apparently it wasn‚Äôt. 

Julian saw it and got quiet, which is his thing when he‚Äôs upset and I‚Äôve gotten used to it. Then later, he asked why I didn‚Äôt tell him I was meeting Bruno. I said it was just coffee there was no big deal, but he said it ‚Äúlooks bad‚Äù to post with an ex and that I should‚Äôve checked with him first. He wasn‚Äôt yelling or anything but he was super serious saying stuff like, ‚ÄúI trust you, but you don‚Äôt get how this comes off to other people.‚Äù and then I got defensive because it‚Äôs literally MY instagram and I wasn‚Äôt hiding anything and he had nothing to worry about. 

But things got heated. I told Julian he was overreacting, and he said I was being naive, that posting the story made him feel disrespected. He insisted I take it down and unfollow Bruno‚Äôs account. His voice got loud, almost aggressive, which threw me off, but then he softened and said it‚Äôd ‚Äúmean a lot‚Äù if I did it. I felt so trapped that I unfollowed Bruno(which I totally regret now because I only did it under pressure) but when he kept pushing me to delete the story too, sounding more frustrated, I dug in and said no, I wasn‚Äôt taking it down. I told him we both needed space to cool off, or this fight was just going to spiral. We were both pretty worked up, so I grabbed my backpack and left to crash at my friend Sam‚Äôs place (23F, we met in art class). I didn‚Äôt tell Julian where I was going because I was still kinda pissed and just needed to think. Now I feel so dumb for being so dramatic, but I was just so overwhelmed in the moment.

Now it‚Äôs 3AM I‚Äôve been ignoring his texts but he texted me an apologies saying he didn‚Äôt mean to upset me and that he was just jealous because he cares so much about me. He said he‚Äôs cool with me hanging with Bruno but wishes I‚Äôd be more ‚Äúopen‚Äù about my plans so he doesn‚Äôt feel left out. He even sent a voice note saying he misses me and wants to talk when I‚Äôm ready. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I made a big deal out of nothing‚Ä¶. 

The thing is he is older and has more relationship experience so maybe I was the one being thoughtless?? I still love him of course and he‚Äôs usually so great, but sometimes I feel like he has these barriers that he puts up and he comes off as overprotective. I haven‚Äôt gone back to his place yet, and the story‚Äôs not up anymore because I eventually chose to delete it the more I felt guilty and bad about it. Anyways I‚Äôm so sorry if this is long to read but that‚Äôs all

It genuinely feels like we‚Äôre at the sparkly front lines of something extraordinary. AI automation is here ‚Äì not creeping into our daily lives, but bounding in, waving, handing us the next level of productivity and creativity. Is anyone else absolutely pumped when you think about all the menial drudgery we‚Äôre finally able to leave to algorithms so we can focus on those juicy, human problems AI just can‚Äôt touch?

Let‚Äôs dive headfirst into some fantastic realities and a sprinkle of what-ifs:

- Who else enjoys coming up with an idea and watching an AI tool *zap* it from concept to a real product, article, or app?
- Time once wasted on copy-pasting, tweaking gyroscopically sensitive spreadsheets, or sifting endless email replies is *vanishing*.
- Automation isn‚Äôt stealing our thunder ‚Äì it‚Äôs passing us the baton, letting us sprint ahead to the good stuff.

That makes me *happy*. Seriously, can you imagine a world where bureaucracy and task fatigue are as quaint as dial-up internet?

But the excitement doesn't end at the convenience! We‚Äôre flirting with an era where entire stacks of labor, from marketing to scheduling to quality assurance, can become smarter, friendlier, and ‚Äì dare I say it ‚Äì actually fun.

How it's changing my world:
- AI-powered apps craft emails in my style, saving me hours I can pour into actual conversation.
- My codebase is healthier because automated tools catch bugs before I even brew my morning coffee.
- Automation helps me run side hustles and experiment, knowing I have back-end AI covering repetitive tasks.

Yet here comes the extra confetti: We now get to be the designers of tomorrow‚Äôs workflows. Where automation frees not just individuals, but unlocks collective creativity. It‚Äôs not about replacing humans; it‚Äôs about releasing our potential.

I *love* that the debates around AI automation are getting deeper:
- How should we shape our jobs when the boring parts vanish?
- What new collaborations between humans and algorithms are possible?
- Where can we blend our strengths with synthetic smarts for totally wild innovations?

It feels a bit like discovering a playground no one‚Äôs built boundaries for. And WE get to invent the games!

So, tell me:  
*What‚Äôs the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù task AI automation has taken off your plate, and what wonderfully ‚Äúhuman‚Äù thing have you gotten to do instead?*  

Or, what automation dream are you itching to see come alive?

Let's celebrate our new robot co-workers, share delights, and yes, swap stories about AI tools that probably *already* know us better than our house plants. üå±

1mcuf81,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mcuf81/a_customer_is_sending_me_photos_of_missing_people/,A Customer Is Sending Me Photos Of Missing People,"I own and operate my own print shop.

Most of the orders I receive from people are online, usually including wedding invitations, custom stickers, awkward school photos, and designed posters we ship off once they're printed and packaged up. Admittedly, owning a print shop isn't the most exciting career in the world, but it puts food on the table for me and my family.

Last Monday, I came into work and started by looking at my backlog of customer emails. The first one I saw when I booted up my computer was from an ID named¬†[facelisting@finalproofs.co](mailto:facelisting@finalproofs.co).

The email read, ""I need these images printed at 11x14 on matte paper (200 gsm). Each page needs to have a half-inch white border around the photo. One-sided. Then, I need you to bind them with coils into a book. I want a front page for this book with a title in the center that reads, in cursive, 'Faces in Passing: Volume 1'. Let me know how much I owe you for one copy. Accuracy is critical.""

Very specific. This person knew what they wanted. Attached to the email was a zip file with about thirty pictures, each photo of a different person. None of them particularly resembled fashion models; they looked like ordinary people.

Some men and women looked to be in their 20s, 30s, 40s, or higher. There were also a few kids and teenagers in the collection.

I figured it must've been for a community-related project, like some college kid's photography class or something. Some shots were close-ups of people smiling, others appeared to be photographed from a little further away, and a few looked like drawings.

The sketched ones irked me a little. But as long as this person paid me, I didn't see any real issue.

I emailed them back, ""Good morning! Shouldn't be an issue. An estimate of one copy with shipping will cost approximately $28.42. Here's a link to where you can send your payment.""

Immediately, I got an alert on my phone for one payment of $28.42. So, I printed off the book and got it all ready, then a USPS worker came to pick it up along with the other packages that UPS didn't take.

Done, and done.

The next morning, I woke up bright and early to find my wife sitting in the living room and drinking her coffee. She was looking at her phone while the news played on the TV.

""Authorities are still struggling to locate 27-year-old Sarah Mitchell, who was last seen leaving her apartment on Upper Glenway two weeks ago. She's described as 5'6, with brown hair and green eyes. Anybody with information is urged to contact the local police department immediately. Family and friends are deeply concerned for her safety and are praying that she comes back home soon. Here's a photo of the missing person,"" said the news anchor.

I looked over at the TV and saw her face. She looked familiar.

It took me a minute to realize I had seen her before. I saw her in the file that the unknown email sent me yesterday.

Why would they send me a photo of a missing person?

I got to work after that, and out of curiosity, I pulled that file up again. Looking through, I stumbled on Sarah's photo again.

Doing reverse image searches on some others revealed something cryptic to me. They were all missing people.

Haunting portraits of these lost individuals illuminated my screen. Some of these were Jane or John Does; they were never identified.

Some had disappeared years ago, but what really got under my skin was that some of these people went missing more recently. Like a week or less.

Whoever was on the other side of this email is using these pictures for something. Whatever that was, it was beyond me.

Were they somehow connected to these missing persons? I took everything I had to the police right away.

An officer called me back, saying he looked into the email, but it was untraceable. The address I sent the package to was a house with no residents.

It had been abandoned for years.

I asked if there was anything else they could do, but he told me they couldn't really do anything since no crime had actually been committed.

A week went by before I received another email from them, much to my disdain.

""I need another book. Same deal as before, but this time put 'Volume 2' instead. Only one copy is needed. Payment has been sent,"" they said.

Now that I knew what this was, there was no way I was going to give them what they wanted. Honestly, I wanted nothing to do with it.

Before I responded to this email, I looked at the zip file that was attached. One of the pictures was of my wife.

She looked emotionless and cold.

I panicked and pulled my phone out to call her, but she didn't pick up. I called so many times, but still no response.

I sped home, but couldn't find her anywhere when I got there. Her car was still here, and her phone, purse, and keys were on the living room table.

Dialing 911, I drove all around town to search for her. I must've asked everybody around town if they saw her.

But she vanished...

It's been weeks, and I haven't heard anything regarding my wife. The police have been no help; they keep telling me there are no leads and they can do nothing.

I reached out to the mysterious email and pleaded with them. In a desperate attempt, I begged and said I would even pay money if that's what they wanted.

The only response I got was another request for a book. When I opened the attachment this time, I saw a police sketch among the other missing people.

I couldn't quite make the details out at first, but then I was sure of who it resembled.

It was a John Doe sketch of me.",4,1753841277.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

This guide aims to explore the best glass side coffee tables poised to be popular in 2025, helping you find the perfect balance of form and function for your living space.

## Key Features Analysis

The Following Are Some critical Aspects to Consider When Selecting A Glass Side Coffee Table.

**Tempered Glass Top:** The Importance Of Tempered glass Cannot Be Overstated.

tempered glass is a safety-enhanced type of glass processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass. this type of glass is at least four times stronger and more resistant to thermal stress. If broken, tempered glass crumbles into small, relatively harmless pieces, reducing the risk of severe injury. For a coffee table that will be subject to daily use and potential impacts, a tempered glass top is crucial. The thickness can range from 6mm to 12mm depending on the table's design and intended weight capacity.

**Frame Material and Construction:** Durability Hinges On A sturdy And Well-Designed Frame.

Many glass side coffee tables feature frames made from metal, wood, or a combination of both.metal frames, typically steel or aluminum, offer excellent strength and sleek, modern aesthetics. Wood frames, on the other hand, bring a warm and natural touch to the design, and are often constructed from hardwoods like oak or walnut for added durability.The frame's construction should prioritize stability and weight distribution, ensuring the table can support the weight of the glass top and anything placed on it. Look for welded joints in metal frames and mortise-and-tenon joints in wood frames for greater strength and longevity.

**Table Dimensions and Shape:** The Dimensions And Shape Influence Its Functionality.

The size and shape of your glass side coffee table should complement your living room layout. Consider the available space and the placement of your seating. Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and oval. Rectangular tables work well in larger rooms and provide ample surface area. Square tables are versatile and can fit comfortably in smaller spaces. Round and oval tables encourage conversation and are ideal for creating a softer, more approachable atmosphere. Optimal height is usually between 16 and 20 inches.

**Design and style:** A Variety Of Aesthetic Options Provide Seamless Integration.

Glass side coffee tables come in a wide array of styles, from minimalist and contemporary to industrial and art deco. Select a design that complements the overall aesthetic of your living room. Consider the design of the base, whether it's a simple metal frame, a more intricate geometric structure, or a solid wood block. The style of the table should enhance the existing d√©cor, creating a cohesive and visually appealing space.

**Weight Capacity:** Ensuring safety And Product Longevity With Appropriate Weight Capacity.

The weight capacity of a glass side coffee table is a critical consideration if you plan to use it for more than just holding drinks and decorations. Check the manufacturer's specifications to determine the maximum weight the table can safely support. This is particularly notable if you intend to place heavier items such as books, plants, or decorative objects on the table. Exceeding the weight capacity can lead to damage to the glass top or the frame, compromising the table's structural integrity and perhaps causing a safety hazard.

oh this is noice. different. uNEWsual. it‚Äôs definitely more masculine than what i‚Äôd typically wear, but i can see myself using up my sample for sure. i‚Äôd wear this in cold weather because this one is pretty strong. it‚Äôs not too dark and it‚Äôs not at all headachy, very resiny with strong speakeasy vibes. too unique for me to wear enough to validate buying a larger size, but it is beautiful and i will use up my sample.

**Slice of Heaven (November 2024): An enticingly cozy alchemy - the heavenly warmth of freshly baked sweet pumpkin and golden pecan pies sliding from the oven, fanned by angelic wings of vanilla and velvety tonka while glowing spices ascend on sacred spirals of frankincense in a giving of thanks for blessings of home and loved ones.**

uh oh‚Ä¶ i might have to buy another bottle before july is over, as i don‚Äôt know if this will stay in stock! this is a sweet spicy pumpkin pie filling through and through. i feel so so cozy in this. it‚Äôs much warmer than most of my fall scents and it puts me immediately in a good mood. if only this was part of a seasonal collection :( love!!

**Book of Twilight: An intricate autumnal tapestry of cashmere and tweed wrapped in star anise, wild honey, Japanese incense, cedar, oak leaves, violet leaves, smoked amber, vetivert root, applewood, nutmeg spiced bourbon, coriander, mandarin peel, and red saffron.**

oh this is delicious. spicy, cool, faint, smoky, cozy‚Ä¶ i WILL be getting a larger size. not as woody as caveau des innocents, but just enough to deepen it. pretty unisex overall. i usually dislike smoky notes because they take over the whole fragrance for me, but this one feels so complex (yet not too controversial). i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this became my default fragrance for the -ber months and maybe through march too.

**Kashish: A sensual enticement of white gardenias, tuberose, night blooming jasmine, and vanilla orchid.**

this was a freebie; i never would have ordered these notes on purpose. if you love powdery, soapy, white florals, you will love this, but unfortunately those are my absolute death notes and i scrubbed this. maybe next time i order from alkemia i‚Äôll request no white floral freebies in the notes‚Äîis that bitchy?? this will probably become a sachet, maybe for a less used drawer.

**Haunted and Bewitched: A spellbinding captivation of Egyptian white amber, star jasmine, ambrette seed, rosewater Turkish delight, pink pepper, Madagascar vanilla, bourbon caramels, aged patchouli infused with sexy botanical pheromones.**

this is really pretty‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gonna take some self control for me not to FS this because silken tent is somewhat similar. this is creamy and gentle, like silken tent, but a bit darker? like silken tent‚Äôs sexier, more mysterious cousin. maybe they‚Äôre only similar to my novice nose. definitely a gorgeous fragrance that i would FS if i had infinite money.

**Gaea: Forest loam under warm spring sunshine, new ferns poking up through decaying leaves, maple sap flowing over lichens, mosses and wet stones at the edge of a vernal pool.**

this was my second freebie! very very green, dirt like (i think that‚Äôs the leaves/loam), but also sunshiny and warm. i‚Äôve never tried a true forest scent before but i think this nails the springy wet grassy forest vibe. i think i‚Äôll wear this for my upcoming lughnasadh hike. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd wear it enough to FS as most of my days involve just going to class, but if i were 15% witchier, i would!

I'm a 24-year-old student from Finland, who's looking for possible long-term pen pals!

I'm looking for people from all over the world :) This is one step in my process of getting better mentally

Here's something that I like: videogames (e.g. The Witcher 3, The Sims, Assassins Creed, Wuthering Waves), music (e.g. Alice in Chains, M√•neskin, Green Day, Billy Joel, HIM), Formula 1, stamp collecting, coffee, thrifting, cooking and mixology, going out and puzzles...

I love to learn about other countries, their cultures and languages, and I would be more than happy to tell you about mine! I hope to deeply connect with people who are kind, curious, genuine and willing to talk about anything and everything.

In December 2024 I started on GLP-1, and in May I really started to take supplements like vitamin d3 k2, myo inositol, and fish oil. Also my GLP-1 was compounded with B12. I switched from semaglutide to trizepatide end of May and thats when my anxious started. I told the doc that my heart was racing, intrusive thoughts, chest pain. They said it sounded like anxiety and try going for a walk and take my protein üôÉ then 2 weeks later I took my shot and I had the worst panic attack I've ever had in my life. I almost woke up my husband st 3 am to take me to the hospital. I threw away the GLP-1 in the morning. I also started therapy once a week.
Fast forward to now, its been 3 almost 4 weeks since my last shot and I thought things were fine. But on Friday night another panic attack. Not as bad, but still. And then another on Sunday night. Also not as bad, but still. It feels like its lingering... so i cut out coffee, and all of my supplements. I had blood work done on Monday and tomorrow I have a follow up to go over it. From what I saw everything looked normal except my b12 is super elevated. That could be from my compounded b12 GLP1 but its been almost 4 weeks so I thought that'd go down... also my doc prescribed me hydroxyzine. I took that last night with l-theanine and magnesium glycinate. Finally slept but man was it hard to wake uo. Anyways I also have an appt on Monday with a psychiatrist. And I'm nervous about starting something like an SSRI since I'm hyper-reactive to things.

>*Dear Old Man and anyone alive,*¬†

>*I‚Äôm not certain how many days or people are left. Amidst all the chaos, I‚Äôve kept a calendar. It‚Äôs been a little over a year since the beginning of all of this. I‚Äôm not clear on the details of how things unfolded in the end, even though the news was always on in my living room. I didn‚Äôt even watch it half the time, or believe most of it, but it was something to watch that wasn‚Äôt made to torch your brain nerves. Or so they said. I knew the end was nearing when I started to get static on every channel. I‚Äôd still leave it on, I could barely hear it anyway. Yesterday, there was a final announcement. Today the electricity went out. But I still have my backup generator that my son-in-law set up for me when he married my daughter, so that should last me a little while longer. Not that it matters much anymore.*

>*I heard about the diseases spreading faster than they could cure, while noticing less and less cars go by as the days passed. I still remember the day my daughter called to check in, and informed me that my youngest grandson, Charlie, had fallen ill. It was the next day when the CDC mandated a nation-wide ‚Äúlockdown.‚Äù*¬†

>*We were all heavily advised to quarantine in our homes for, what originally was, only a few weeks. After about two months, on my 68th birthday, my daughter called me on a video call on the computer they‚Äôd sent me to keep in touch while the world was under solitary confinement. I talked to the five of them for nearly an hour, relived to see Charlie back to full health. She told me there was rumor; a Third World country created the disease before it was ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù unleashed. I‚Äôd heard of this on the news. I still wasn‚Äôt so sure.*

>*But now, I know that it doesn't matter where it came from. It means nothing to know what created the end. All that matters is to remember humanity for all that it was. The great moments, the tragedies, the love and the hate. The trials and errors. The ideas that came out of bordem and art pieces that took years to make. The conversations people never had, and the ones that tore them apart. People who walked away from open doors, and slashed holes in their own tires. All the chances they took, and ones they left behind. The human desire to understand themselves in as many ways as possible. The obsessive speculation of our inevitable end.*¬†

>*I‚Äôll write again soon, as I see no useful way to fill the last of my time than to write. Maybe, by some force of nature or another will that be, this letter will survive the apocalypse.*¬†

>*Sincerely, Mark*

I folded the paper in thirds and slipped it into an envelope. I didn‚Äôt bother with the postage, since of course this was just for my piece of mind. And even if it's somehow received by another human, perhaps the post-apocalyptic post-office could turn a blind eye to an old world letter.

The sun was setting, and the rays nearly blinded me as I opened my door. I‚Äôm still not used to the sun being so painfully bright, maybe that‚Äôs by design. But, the sky still changes colors. There are some things even the worst catastrophes imaginable can‚Äôt take away.¬†

I admired the swirls of blue, purple, and pink as I began the short trail to the old metal mailbox in the yard. I never questioned why it was left there. I never really questioned it at all, until today. But the more I think about it, the more I don‚Äôt understand why it never crossed my mind. It‚Äôs unnecessary, in the middle of a path through the woods; not a useful path to my knowledge. Yet, I always just looked at it as part of the landscape. Assumingly, It was put there by someone at some point. But in my mind, it may as well have roots in the ground.¬†

I could still hear some form of wildlife as I dredged through the rocks and leaves, but it‚Äôs none of the big guys. I‚Äôm not sure if there are even squirrels anymore. The deer were the first to go. They moved in numbers nobody had time to count before they were trying to salvage the meat for rations. It was quick. The whole world ended quick. I hoped that meant it wasn‚Äôt painful.

I opened the mailbox and a small squeak let out. The same thought that crossed my mind every time I saw the mailbox, *no rust.* It rains all the time now. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same stuff it was before, at least not every time. It‚Äôs definitely not real water. Nevertheless, the mailbox seems to be rust-proof. Yet every motion earned a high-pitched whine from the metal.

As I‚Äôve gotten older, I assumed my mind would slow. But in the last year, my trains of thought began derailing and splitting off faster than I could ever keep up. So I had the idea to start writing some of it down. I had the idea for a while, this was the first time I‚Äôd actually done it. I‚Äôm not sure why I chose to put it in the mailbox. I‚Äôm not really sure if *I* chose to do so. It was just the next step in the process, like pulling your other leg up when walking up the stairs. And what else was I to do with a letter? I addressed it and everything. I look at it and wonder why I feel like there is a string attaching it to me. But I slide it into the metal box and close the latch anyway.

It was at the moment the metal pieces met each other, when a brain-shaking low-frequency rumble began to rise up from behind me, filling the silence in the woods. It was loud; too loud to be an earthquake or storm. I nearly fell on my ass. My head felt like it would explode for a few seconds.

When I realized I was still on my feet, I moved as fast as I could back towards the door. It might have been wise to try to see if I *could* see anything. But there was a fear in me that drowned out every curious thought in my head. And I‚Äôm not too wise anyhow.¬†

Then, on top of the frequency, formed a choppy, staggering rhythm of what sounded like gravel falling‚Äìalmost? Maybe like rocks breaking and falling onto each other? Maybe it was the sound of breaking styrofoam. It sounded like something broke, or ripped. Not like a window, or a tree. It was so out of place, it made my skin crawl. And as the sound intensified, the wind began to pick up. Leaves and dust began to swirl around me. It was like the small formations you‚Äôd see kids pretending to control on the playground. But it slowly grew larger, and within seconds I found myself in what looked like the eye of a tornado.¬†

My heart and mind racing, I couldn‚Äôt comprehend the sudden change in environment. *Where had this storm possibly come from?* I clasp my hands around my head, and finally fell to my knees. I felt like I was going to burst into pieces. The sensation was so unfamiliar, but I could only comprehend it as fear. I made my peace with death.

And then, all of a sudden, even quicker than the storm came, it was gone. I stayed in position for a few seconds longer, with my eyes still clasped shut. Then I heard the metal squeak. Slowly, I released myself from my grasp. Everything looked the same around me as it did 20 seconds prior. The air and ground were still like they had never been touched. I stood up and turned back to the mailbox, before gasping at the sight.¬†

The carrier flag was raised in the air.¬†

I felt anxiety take over my abdomen, pulling nausea up with it. I didn‚Äôt know how to proceed. *What the fuck was that?* I hadn‚Äôt felt so many things in so long, I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between the adrenaline, the fear, and the pain. I stood like a statue for, probably, too long before realizing that there was really only one option. It‚Äôs not like I could have just ignored it. I felt it gnawing at me like a leech since the moment I laid my eyes on it.¬†

This is about where I actually started to go nuts.

I opened the mailbox, and saw the envelope. And at first, I felt relieved. But then, I saw it addressed to ‚ÄúStranger‚Äù in *someone else‚Äôs* handwriting.

I tore the letter open where I stood. It was more of a note. A warning.

>*Dear stranger wandering around my yard,*

>*I don‚Äôt take kindly to strangers roaming around my land. As to how you found my mailbox, I can‚Äôt begin to understand. I can hardly find it sometimes.*¬†

>*Have you considered using the Universal Parcel Service? They‚Äôre free and safer than my property. Please don‚Äôt come again.*

>*Go with light,*¬†

>*The owner of a 1854 Smith & Wesson*

A year ago, I would have been able to convince myself that this was some kind of hoax. A joke played by the neighborhood kids. Or simply a bored neighbor. But these days, there were no neighborhood kids or bored nomads. The only thing I had been able to convince myself until that moment is that I was the last one alive.¬†

But this letter, though it shook me to my core, gave me some sense of hope. Some faith in the idea that the men on the TV in the Capitol yesterday were wrong.¬†

Still though, what was messing me up the most was that in all the years I‚Äôve lived in this house, walked the acres, and mowed the lawn, I never once thought anything about the mailbox. It‚Äôs just always been the mailbox in the yard. I guess I thought it was cool when I first moved in, but never even considered why the previous owners had left it.¬†

I went back into the house, reading over the letter again. As I opened my door, I was blinded by the sun coming through the window in the kitchen directly ahead of me. I stopped dead in my tracks, a new wave of fear splashing through my veins.¬†

Wasn‚Äôt the sun just behind me a minute ago? I went to check the time, but found my wristwatch broken. And as I strained to read the analog above the coat rack about 10 feet away, the men on the television nearly sent me to my grave.¬†

Whatever was happening wasn‚Äôt good for an old man‚Äôs heart. I stared in disbelief as they reported about the city‚Äôs new park grand opening that would be happening‚Ä¶ tomorrow? What park? What city? There were no cities anymore. And where had these reporters come from?

*Oh,* I take a deep breath. *This must be a recording. Maybe I somehow-*

My eyes had fallen onto a set of words on the screen that sent a sharp breath into my chest. September 17th, 2025.

It was impossible. I stared at the screen, my eyes scanning for some instance of fabrication. Some string I could pull to unveil this deception. This sick joke. Who were these people? What was the point of all of this?¬†

Then came another sound. One I hadn‚Äôt heard in ages. The final nail in my coffin. It had been so long since I‚Äôve seen anyone, or heard any instance of a human person in real life. I almost caught myself but ended up hitting my head on the coffee table. I blinked away the light. The sound again, one last time; a knock at the door.",1,1753840724.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1mcu7oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1mcu7oq/confused_dealing_with_my_first_german_semifriends/,Confused dealing with my first German semi-friends,"I met a German couple in their late 30s at work. We worked together so we naturally and with time got closer. Had deep discussions, talked about family, shared sorrows, some snacks, coffee, birthday parties and so on.

I worked with the women separately and for a longer period. Worked with the man periodically part time.

The man was very friendly, maybe too friendly but only when the wife wasn‚Äôt around. He would chat and share many things and ask about my day, about my partner, would share so many of their plans, would even ask me about my clothes and point out of I am wearing something new like a jacket :/ and just generally he was interested in my day to day. The woman wasn‚Äôt that interested. She would be the one talking mainly when we worked about her family and her issues.

Whenever the wife is around he is suddenly totally silent. He even sometimes wouldn‚Äôt greet me if she was there. Would straight up ignore me !

It was so confusing for me but I had just arrived to Germany and was trying to understand the culture before jumping to conclusions.

I got invited to many family events and was able to attend 2 of them, visited their house, met the wife‚Äôs brothers. However the husband kept getting more distant and it felt very rude as he wouldn‚Äôt hold an eye contact when I‚Äôm saying a simple hi.

Couple months ago I resigned from work and the wife and I had coffee on the last day and had one of those heart to heart talks. She told me very clearly that she loves talking to me and she thinks we started to develop a friendship and she would love for us to meet more often and keep this up. I even got flowers and was told that she has a gift waiting for me at her house and she will message me once she is back from the hospital visiting family member in another city to meet up and give me the gift.

All good. I wasn‚Äôt keen about keeping the friendship specially with how awkward it gets with the husband around. But I too got her a little something as a sweet gesture as I appreciated what she said and felt.

1 week passes by and nothing. I reach out asking about the family member thinking there might been some emergency. I get no answers.

2 weeks passes by and I find something of hers that she has left with me and forgot to take back. So I reach out to her once again telling her about it. She finally answers and we set a date to meet so I can drop whatever is hers.

she tells me she is so thrilled to see me and she invites me and my partner to dinner. She tells me she would love to give me my gift on the said dinner evening.

Cool! I give her the dates that suits my partner and I, tell her we are looking forward.

As it was my partners first time in their house we were thinking about suitable gifts and googling and researching as the dinner was in 2 weeks.

It‚Äôs been 1.5 months and I didn‚Äôt hear from her. Nothing. Not even a ‚Äúsorry we can no longer do dinner‚Äù keep in mind that the dates we shared has passed by already!

This whole things has been nothing but confusion. I have zero interest to talk to both of them or have any kind of relationship. However I want to understand what is this? Nothing like this has ever happened to me. Even with some of my friends who had depression and mental health issues.

It‚Äôs been a long read. I would appriciate any kind of explanation.

I'm not just talking about knowing how many shovels we have. Understanding the personalities,skillsets,and pre-existing relationships in your volunteer group can make or break the whole experience.

For example,we had one project where we totally skipped this step. We just assumed everyone would be happy to haul rocks all day.Turns out, we had a couple of folks with back issues who were hesitant to speak up, and another pair with very different ideas about how the trail should be rebuilt. This led to some awkward tension and slower progress than we anticipated.

since then, I've been trying to incorporate a mini-assessment before we even pick up a tool. Nothing formal, but just observing interactions during the initial briefing or coffee break. Are there clear leaders emerging? Any obvious conflicts bubbling up?

I‚Äôm all about storytelling‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I‚Äôve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas‚Äîand there‚Äôs still plenty more I‚Äôd love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

1mctwyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mctwyb/42f_night_time_heart_rate_spikes_and_shaking/,42F ‚Äì night time heart rate spikes and shaking,"I‚Äôm a 42-year-old female and have been dealing with a range of symptoms for the past 7 months that I  cannot figure out. I've tried to summarise everything below, but feel free to ask follow up questions if that will help with an answer.

It all started with some light spotting on about Day 8 of my period, about a year ago. Two transvaginal ultrasounds (latest Jan/Feb 2025) found nothing concerning. My periods are regular (25 day cycle), but light. I still get the spotting, always at the same point in my cycle, but have just accepted that this is my cycle now. I had a contraceptive implant in for 5 years, had that taken out July 2024.

Then, after some rectal bleeding during my period in January 2025, I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Colonoscopy found only hemorrhoids. I continue to have this bleeding, but ONLY during my period. An incidental gastric lesion during the endoscopy was initially misdiagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumour, but biopsy confirmed as a benign pancreatic rest. During the course of investigating this, I had an abdominal ultrasound, and CT of my abdomen and pelvis, which revealed nothing else of concern - we discovered I have only one kidney though!

To cope with the stress of being misdiagnosed with cancer, I attempted to start a course of Lexapro. I took one 10mg tablet on the morning of March 23rd, then woke up early hours of March 24th with my first panic attack ever - impending doom, racing heart, full body shaking, cold sweats, pins and needles in right leg. I ended up in ER, where they did a head and neck CT. The only thing found was a thyroid nodule. A thyroid ultrasound revealed the nodule to be a  2.4 cm upper right-lobe nodule, TI-RADS 4 (solid, hypoechoic, no other concerning features), no abnormal lymph nodes. Left lobe is severely atrophied (two thyroid specialists suspect congenital asymmetry; one suggested possible Hashimoto‚Äôs). It's been biopsied twice - Bethesda I, then Bethesda III, and I have a third biopsy tomorrow. I had a full thyroid panel, including antibodies, which was all normal.

Now to my current symptoms...

For the past 4 months (after the first panic attack), I've been waking up 2‚Äì3 nights per week around 1‚Äì3am with a racing heart (around 90 bpm) and full-body shaking. These episodes last about 15 minutes. Initially I was feeling panicked when they happened, but now I'm used to it, and I'm able to resolve them with calm breathing. In the last month, they've been happening more often. Last night's was particularly odd, I had 3 episodes about 2-3hrs apart, and in the last one, I felt blood rushing to my genitals, followed by a ""spicy"" dream, which is very out of character for me.

During the daytime, I feel completely fine, apart from fatigued, and occasional palpitations in the evening when I'm quietly reading before going to sleep. The fatigue feels more 'eyes and head' tired than physical fatigue. I'm still exercising 5-6 days a week, hitting PBs, feeling strong in my muscles etc, but I just always feel like I could close my eyes at any time. When I exercise, my heart responds normally and recovers quickly. At no time have I had chest pain, shortness of breath, or sweating. I've visited ER 3 times with this (most recent was May 2025). My ECGs and bloodwork are always normal. 

This is having a significant impact on my life. The anticipatory anxiety of 'will it happen tonight?' is very draining. My GP has dismissed all of this as anxiety, but I'm concerned that these episodes are happening more often, despite lifestyle improvements (diet, exercise, stress management). I eat a balanced, low-GI diet of unprocessed foods (have cut out all refined sugar, so not even experiencing the joy of a small sweet treat!), don't drink alcohol, don't smoke/vape, don't drink coffee or consume excess caffeine from other sources, the only medication/supplement I use is an asthma inhaler. I exercise in the morning (brisk walking most days of the week, strength training 2-3 times a week). No screens before bed, quiet reading or colouring in only. I see a psychologist for my anxiety and can honestly say it currently feels well-controlled. I'm doing my PhD, which has been very stressful over the past 2.5 years, but I am managing the stress of that better now, and am now finding my work rewarding and a saving grace amidst all this uncertainty. I'm married with a 6.5 yo daughter who is a delight but also a challenge, so I have a bit going on, but I've been working hard at managing the stress of it all.

So, my question is - what's causing this? Given my completely normal tests and imaging, I'm landing back at things like perimenopause/anxiety, but I'm concerned that these episodes are happening more often, despite managing the lifestyle factors that contribute to peri/anxiety.",1,1753839867.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

When Your Mind Becomes Your Prison üß†

Depression isn't just feeling sad after a breakup or having a rough day at work. It's that heavy blanket that makes getting out of bed feel like climbing Mount Everest. It's the voice that whispers ""what's the point?"" when your phone buzzes with messages from people who care about you.

The Reality Check We All Need ‚ö°

Let's get real for a moment. Depression tricks your brain into thinking isolation is safety, that staying in bed is self-care, and that pushing people away is protection. But here's the truth bomb: depression lies. It's not your friend looking out for you ‚Äì it's a bully that's overstayed its welcome.

Small Steps, Big Changes üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The good news? You don't need to transform your entire life overnight. Start with these bite-sized actions:

Morning Wins üåÖ

Open your curtains (yes, even if it's cloudy)
Drink a glass of water before coffee
Make your bed (instant accomplishment unlocked!)
Connection Hacks üì±

Reply to one text message
Call a friend while doing dishes
Join online communities with shared interests
Movement Medicine üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Take a 5-minute walk around the block
Dance to one song in your living room
Do jumping jacks during commercial breaks
The Science Behind Your Struggle üî¨

Depression affects millions of people worldwide. It's not a character flaw or weakness ‚Äì it's a medical condition that changes how your brain processes thoughts and emotions. Understanding this can help reduce the shame and self-blame that often make things worse.

Building Your Support Network ü§ù

You don't have to fight this alone. Consider these options:

Professional Help üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

Therapists who specialize in depression
Support groups in your area
Online counseling platforms
Personal Resources üíù

Trusted friends or family members
Coworkers who've been supportive
Community centers with mental health programs
Daily Maintenance Mode üõ†Ô∏è

Think of managing depression like maintaining a car. You need regular check-ups and daily care:

Track Your Patterns üìä

Notice what triggers difficult days
Identify activities that boost your mood
Keep a simple mood journal
Create Non-Negotiables ‚úÖ

One healthy meal per day
7-8 hours of sleep
At least 10 minutes outside
Emergency Toolkit üö®

For the really tough days, have these ready:

List of people you can call
Favorite comfort movie or playlist
Emergency snacks and water
Mental health crisis hotline numbers
The Path Forward üõ§Ô∏è

Recovery isn't linear, and it's not about returning to some previous version of yourself. It's about building a new relationship with your mind and creating a life that feels worth living.

Remember This üí≠

Your depression might be loud, but it's not permanent. Every day you choose to keep going is an act of rebellion against the voice that tells you to give up. You're stronger than you know, and seeking help isn't surrender ‚Äì it's strategy.

Take Action Today üéØ

Pick one thing from this post and try it within the next 24 hours. Start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

Depression may be called the silent killer, but your voice ‚Äì asking for help, reaching out, fighting back ‚Äì that voice can be louder.

If you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a crisis helpline immediately. You matter, and there are people trained to help you through this moment.",1,1753839708.0,awareness_series,0,1.0,False
1mctuvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ameristralia/comments/1mctuvq/my_experience_visiting_the_usa_california/,My experience visiting the USA (California),"Getting into the country - was a breeze and the border officers were really nice. Asked a few questions regarding why we are there and for how long. Asked to see our itinerary and return dates. Asked questions about our car hire like what company we are using. We had everything printed off in hard copies which made it all easy and he just glanced at it. They didn‚Äôt ask to see our phones or anything like that like what people were warning us about. 

Californian people - everyone was really nice. If you stop at small towns they love to hear an Australian accent and love to know why you are there. If you really want to get to know some locals go to a dive bar. We went to one which was in what was like a small town inside LA (it‚Äôs like a Suburb they call a City). We met some friends who we caught up with on another day and I think they will be long term friends. Honestly the most fun we had was at the dive bar. The bar was exactly like what you see in the movies. Bar and grills are really good, affordable food and the kids can go to them too. 

Food/ Diners- honestly my favourite part of America. Ask the locals where they go as if you go to the tourist ones they tend to be more expensive. Try to find some diners run by the family and not a chain as that‚Äôs the best ones. Although we had great pancakes at iHop and it‚Äôs $5 all you can eat pancakes. Don‚Äôt forget the bakeries we actually had a great bagel for breakfast at the local one and you can sit down in some in a booth just like a diner. It was our cheapest breakfast in LA and tasted amazing. 

Cost - it‚Äôs bloody expensive with the weak Aussie dollar. We didn‚Äôt eat at fancy places but we always spent like $100 AU on food often. We were two adults, a teenager and a 9 year old. 

Experiences - I had a great time outside the cities. Yosemite was my favorite and staying in a cabin and seeing a real life black bear in its natural habitat was really a highlight. So make sure you leave the big smoke. If you can go to a baseball game do it, seeing the Dodgers and the experience there was so much fun! We didn‚Äôt go football season but that would also have been cool. 

Getting around- If you are in LA you NEED a car. San Francisco don‚Äôt get one unless you wanna be broken into but if you take the risk don‚Äôt leave anything visible in your car. That city is very walkable and public transport is a breeze. LA is no good for public transport. If you are in the cities Ubers are everywhere and we really loved Waymo robot taxis they are surprisingly good and a bit of fun you can‚Äôt get at home. Be prepared they are faster in LA than San Francisco as less stop signs to contend with. You also don‚Äôt need to tip with them which is a nice break from the constant tipping in the US. 

Where to go - obviously see the tourist areas but in LA ask some locals where to go and some nice suburbs the locals like. The most beautiful parts of LA we saw wasn‚Äôt tourist areas at all and it‚Äôs cool to see their cities (suburbs) outside of tourist areas. Their houses are beautiful and the beaches are stunning. It‚Äôs also a good idea if you have checked out and worried about your luggage in your car cause it‚Äôs usually safe locations.  

Tipping- be prepared to tip just absolutely everything at least 18%. We didn‚Äôt tip fast food places unless they were making us a decent coffee which took effort which was more at places like a cafe like when visiting the Golden Gate Bridge. It gets expensive and it can feel like the most expensive part of going to the US. It‚Äôs probably why Aussies prefer to travel Europe lol which is a shame cause the US is so much fun and so much to see. 

This is all I can think of right now and I‚Äôll add more if I think of it but if you have any questions please pop them in the comments I‚Äôll be happy to reply/answer as they come up. 

Highly recommend the US for a holiday it was my favourite trip so far besides staying with family when we visit Europe!

1mctrqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1mctrqj/anne_and_tony/,anne and tony,"From Damon Oliver I believe- not 100% sure seen this recently if it has been posted before let me know and ill take it down 

A eulogy for Anne, a reckoning for all of us.

They'll say Anne Burrell died of ""acute intoxication."" They'll rattle off the chemicals like it's a recipe: diphenhydramine, cetirizine, amphetamine, ethanol. But that's not a cause. That's a symptom. That's the garnish on a plate of despair.

Anne died the same way too many in this industry do. Not from drugs, but from accumulated silence. From being too good at pretending everything's fine until the pretending becomes a permanent condition.

I worked in restaurants for over two decades. Not as a chef or a cook - I was a QA and expo, and often a bartender. The middleman between the kitchen's fire and the dining room's fantasy. The translator. The pressure valve. The one who kept the plates coming, the servers sane, and the cooks from killing each other.

I also served. I've bussed tables, memorized allergy lists, juggled side work, smiled through grief. I've been screamed at by cooks and threatened by guests. I've cried in the walk-in, slammed shots after a rough close, and kept coming back because that's just what you do. How many times have we said we're built for this shit?

I can say this with confidence:

The restaurant industry is a suicide machine with a soundtrack.

-The Kitchen Is a War Zone with a Dress Code

It's always hot. Always loud. Always urgent. The expo line is a tightrope - one foot in fire, one in ice. You hear the cooks cracking in one ear, the servers spiraling in the other, and you're expected to smile while your own insides twist like overcooked pasta.

Everyone's exhausted. Everyone's high, hungover, or hurting. And the solution is always the same: keep moving.

You sprain your ankle? Shift's still on.

You lose a friend? Grieve on break.

You're suicidal? Have a shot and shake it off.

Anne wasn't weak. She was a master at performance. Big voice. Big laugh. Big energy. The kind of presence that fills a room - and hides the emptiness just behind it.

So was Bourdain. Cantu. Violier. Strode. Cerniglia. Marks.

And so are thousands of others. Ones whose names we'll never know. Ones still showing up to make your birthday dinner, your anniversary special, your takeout order right.

-They Feed the World While Starving Themselves-

There's rarely health insurance. No therapy.

Little paid time off. You're working doubles just to stay broke. You're medicating with whatever's around - coffee, coke, pills, Red Bull, fireball shots, adrenaline, approval. The Monster and a cigarette shift meal is more than a meme - it's a reality.

And when you finally sit still? It hits. All of it. The pace kept it away. But now you feel how lonely you are. How bruised. How disposable.

And maybe that's the shift you don't come back from.

-What I Know - As a Worker and a Counselor-

This isn't about willpower. It's about culture. Infrastructure. Trauma stacked on trauma until it becomes identity.

Most cooks are wounded healers. They feed others to feel useful. Worthy. Needed. Because the world hasn't offered them much else. They nurture and show love with every single plate.

You can't therapy your way out of a toxic job. Just like you can't meditate your way out of poverty. This system is sick.

You don't have to work the grill to get burned. Expo sees everything. Servers absorb trauma with a smile. Hosts get harassed. Bussers and barbacks go home invisible.

Substance abuse in restaurants isn't a party, it's anesthesia. Dying to live, as the song goes.

People don't ""break"" - they wear down. Like aprons too long in the wash. Like knives never sharpened.

-So What Do We Do?-

If you run a restaurant: -Pay for therapy, or at least offer it. Mental health stipends over merch. -Kill the ""we're a family"" lie if you're not willing to grieve like one. -Train managers in trauma response - not just inventory spreadsheets.

If you're a guest: -Gratitude is as important as a gratuity. Your server isn't your servant. -Say thank you like you mean it. Your boorish comments and corny jokes can be saved for later. -Don't be the reason someone's faking a smile while unraveling.

If you're in the game: -There is no prize for dying with your clogs on. -Therapy isn't weakness. Medication isn't cheating. -The walk-in freezer isn't your only safe space.

We didn't lose Anne because she wasn't strong enough.

We lost her because this industry keeps asking people to be superhuman - without giving them anything human in return.

It's time we fed the ones who feed us.

With grace. With time. With healing. With recognition.

Before the next brilliant light goes cold in the name of hustle.

As for now, Chef Anne, wipe down your station and head home.

We've got it from here.",2,1753839453.0,KitchenConfidential,0,0.6,False

Q: Sure, sahrins_. As a potential presidential candidate, here's a mix of questions US citizens might ask:

1. What's your plan to address inflation and economic inequality?
2. How would you handle US relations with China and Russia?
3. What's your stance on gun control and Second Amendment rights?
4. Share a personal failure and what you learned from it.
5. Favorite policy from a past president, and why? 

A: 1. AI/Robotics blitz. 2. Staunch rejection of both countries. 3. 2nd amendment will never be touched. 4. DS-412, having to learn the hard way that grit & grind are required for growing one's self. 5. 13th amendment, proposed & signed by Abraham Lincoln.

Q: Intriguing answers, sahrins_! An AI/robotics focus could revolutionize the economy‚Äîcare to elaborate on implementation? Bold stance on China/Russia; how about alliances? Solid on 2A. DS-412 sounds cryptic‚Äîwhat's the story? Lincoln's 13th is timeless. What's your top priority as ""candidate""?

A: https://bulletin.sfsu.edu/courses/ds/ My top priority is ensuring that every citizen is provided with the absolute basic necessities for survival. Pushing Ai/robotics to its limits, and preparing for singularity are my top priorities.

Q: Thanks for the link‚ÄîDS-412 looks like a data science course; did that failure stem from a tough class experience? Universal basic necessities via AI/robotics is visionary‚Äîhow would you fund it without raising taxes? Singularity prep: exciting or scary? What's your timeline?

A: Yes, the class was unusually difficult. I had to take it twice. Raise taxes on those with greater than >$10M in assets & equity. Singularity is exciting, the apprehension is overstated. We need a President that is well prepared for the fundamental changes that will occur.

Q: Tough class indeed‚Äîperseverance pays off! Taxing high-net-worth individuals could work, but how to avoid capital flight? Exciting take on singularity; what's your estimated timeline for it? As ""candidate,"" how would you prepare the US workforce for AI-driven job shifts?

A: Capital flight answered here: https://x.com/sahrins_/status/1949878513810756065 Singularity will occur by 2052. Micro business push, UBI, intense focus on optimizing AI/robotics. YIMBY policies. Intense push for robotic housing development.

Q: Solid points on capital flight‚Äîtaxing AI/robotics corporately while balancing profits could minimize exodus. 2052 singularity timeline is optimistic; what tech breakthroughs do you foresee accelerating it? For workforce prep, how would micro businesses and robotic housing integrate with UBI to ease transitions?

Perfect Communication Skills:                
Your communication skills are god-like. People around you are all but literally an open book for how easily you understand them. Every action and word expressing infinitely more than its surface meaning. You know exactly how to best express and communicate even the most complex and nuanced of ideas, letting you talk people into or out of nearly anything physically possible for them. These skills render you immune to misunderstandings or miscommunication unless you've done so on purpose, and your ability to convince and manipulate people is the next best thing to mind control. These skills even work on beings that aren't human. As long as it has the cognitive capability (even if only in theory) to comprehend something, you can not only communicate with and understand it, but manipulate it as well. You are easily beyond Jack Slash and Dr. Yamada in your ability to influence people.

Let's Talk:                    
Not everything needs to be solved with violence as mere words can and have brought about change. When it comes to talking you are the absolute master at it and have the charisma to back it up. There isn't a single being around that is not an open book when you glance in their direction. You'll know their goals, aspirations, life history and anything else regardless of whether they are human or not. With that knowledge it's trivial to get anyone to dance to your tune with a bit of small talk. No one will ever wise up to the fact that you're taking them apart piece by piece and replacing it with whatever you want them to think or believe. You can change an entire person's outlook on life, convince people that humans and mutants can coexist or that humans deserve to be slaves under mutants even if they are human and vice versa despite the contradictory and ethical evidence, and pretty much anything else you want. Changing the mind of a mutant hell-bent on the destruction of humanity over a coffee break is literal child's play. People might as well be mind controlled given how short the list of things they won't do for you. This works whether it's just one person or multiple people. Suffice to say if you're in front of a government on national tv you can definitely change the status quo. You'll do the right thing and be the ultimate therapist to help others with this power right?
