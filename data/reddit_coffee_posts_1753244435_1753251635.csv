The same brand gets tossed into the shopping cart each month‚Äîminty paste, quick rinse, done. But after years of sensitivity, gum irritation, and feeling like toothpaste was doing more numbing than healing, a lot of folks are taking a closer look at what's going in their mouth every day.

Enter Ayurvedic oral care. There‚Äôs been growing interest in herbal and holistic dental routines, and one product that‚Äôs quietly gained attention is **Kajah Special Tooth Powder**‚Äîa traditional herbal blend rooted in Ayurvedic medicine, used in India for decades.

https://preview.redd.it/1uom02gtgkef1.png?width=228&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddfa95c6856677df81db1450901288989a20350f

# Why Tooth Powder?

Before mass-market toothpaste became the norm, herbal powders were the standard for dental care across many cultures. They‚Äôre typically made of ground herbs, clays, and natural minerals‚Äîfree of artificial foaming agents, colors, or preservatives.

Tooth powders might seem outdated to some, but the benefits are clear when you look at the ingredients. There‚Äôs no fluoride, SLS, saccharin, or plastic microbeads‚Äîjust plant-based, antimicrobial ingredients meant to cleanse the mouth without disrupting its natural balance.

# What Kajah Tooth Powder Does Differently

Kajah isn‚Äôt trying to reinvent anything fancy. It sticks to Ayurvedic principles‚Äîuse herbs with proven antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and astringent effects to clean the teeth and support gum health. What makes this one effective is its ability to remove plaque and freshen breath while being extremely gentle on the gums.

From the first few uses, it‚Äôs easy to notice the difference. It doesn‚Äôt foam, and there‚Äôs no overpowering flavor. It‚Äôs earthy, slightly spicy, and leaves the mouth feeling genuinely clean‚Äînot in a ‚Äúmint-burn‚Äù way, but like everything unwanted was scrubbed away.

Key benefits include:

* Removal of plaque and food debris
* Mild whitening from polishing surface stains
* Support for gum health‚Äîespecially bleeding or receding gums
* pH balancing to help prevent bad breath and bacterial overgrowth
* No synthetic ingredients, making it safer for long-term use

# What‚Äôs in It?

While the exact recipe isn‚Äôt listed in detail on the packaging, Ayurvedic tooth powders like Kajah commonly use ingredients such as:

* **Clove** ‚Äì for its strong antibacterial and analgesic properties
* **Licorice root** ‚Äì known for reducing inflammation and healing mouth sores
* **Neem** ‚Äì a powerful antimicrobial used in Indian oral care for centuries
* **Babul bark** ‚Äì for tightening and toning the gums
* **Camphor or menthol** ‚Äì sometimes added for a mild cooling effect

In addition, Kajah helps maintain the **oral microbiome**‚Äîunlike some mouthwashes and pastes that indiscriminately kill bacteria (both harmful and beneficial), herbal powders help restore balance.

# How It‚Äôs Used

There‚Äôs no fancy application here. Just moisten your toothbrush or finger, dip into the powder, and brush normally. A little goes a long way, and the product lasts for months.

It can also be used alongside other Ayurvedic practices like oil pulling or tongue scraping to complete a natural oral care routine.

# A Few Things to Know

* **Taste/Texture**: It‚Äôs not sweet or minty like commercial toothpaste. It may take a few uses to adjust, but it‚Äôs much gentler on sensitive mouths.
* **Packaging**: Comes in a compact 50g container and is very travel-friendly. At ‚Çπ18 per unit, it‚Äôs extremely affordable.
* **Who It‚Äôs For**: Great for people looking to switch to natural oral care, especially those with gum issues or toothpaste sensitivity.

One word of caution‚Äîthose with allergies to specific herbs should double-check ingredients (or consult with an Ayurvedic practitioner).

# The Ayurvedic Perspective

Ayurveda treats oral health as deeply connected to systemic health. A clean mouth, strong gums, and balanced bacteria are all tied to digestion and immunity. Kajah‚Äôs formula reflects this holistic view‚Äîcleaning the mouth isn‚Äôt just cosmetic, it‚Äôs preventive care.

Many also notice side benefits‚Äîless mouth dryness, fewer ulcers, and even improved taste sensitivity. These aren't guaranteed outcomes, but they're reported by long-term users who‚Äôve made the switch from chemical-based pastes.

# Bottom Line

Kajah Special Tooth Powder isn‚Äôt about whitening in a week or giving you a TV-commercial smile. It‚Äôs a return to basics: clean teeth, healthy gums, and ingredients that make sense.

For those tired of the synthetic cycle and looking to simplify with a traditional, effective solution, this is a product worth trying. It may not have the flash of branded tubes, but its value lies in its roots‚Äîliterally.

And the price? ‚Çπ18 for 50g. Cheaper than a coffee, and it lasts a month or more.

1m71qff,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1m71qff/case_study_portfolio_review_from_a_50_security/,Case Study & Portfolio Review: From a 50+ Security Mess to a 5-Fund High-Conviction Strategy,"Hey r/IndianStockMarket ,

I'm hoping this post can serve two purposes: first, to get your feedback on my newly structured portfolio, and second, to serve as a detailed case study for others who might be struggling with portfolio complexity.

After realising my investment approach was chaotic and inefficient, I've spent the last month developing a disciplined, long-term framework. I'm now ready to consolidate and execute.

**Preface & Profile:**

* **Goal:** Aggressive long-term (20-30 years) wealth creation.
* **Risk Profile:** High. My financial foundation is secure, allowing me to view significant market downturns as rare buying opportunities.

**The Issue & Consolidation (The ""Before"" Picture)**

Until now, my portfolio has been a complete mess. It was a chaotic collection of:

* 60% in direct equity (\~35+ stocks) from a fund manager and my own ""hot"" picks.
* 40% in mutual funds (\~15+ funds) with no clear strategy.

The result? The entire setup was a nightmare to track and a constant source of low-grade stress. My direct equity portfolio couldn't even beat the index, the winners were cancelled out by the losers (""diworsification"" at its finest), and I was paying fees for the privilege of underperforming.

This chaos directly conflicted with my professional life. As a software engineer, my mind is wired to build systems. My real passion is my entrepreneurial push to discover and build new tech companies. Trying to track dozens of businesses and second-guess market movements felt like running a second, high-stress job I was terrible at.

**The Realisation: I'm Betting on Myself**

The turning point was a simple but profound realisation. Instead of spending my precious time constantly monitoring companies and trying to learn the art of stock picking, I decided to make a different bet: a bet on myself.

I've had exceptional growth in my career as a software engineer, and I have immense conviction in my entrepreneurial journey. That is my true alpha, my primary engine for wealth creation. I decided my most valuable investment, my time, should be funnelled there. My savings, in turn, should be put on autopilot, managed by professionals I hire for the job.

**The Ideology: Moving from Amateur to CEO**

My new investment philosophy is built on a few core principles: discipline, patience, and recognising the limits of my own time and expertise. The goal is to stop being a frantic stock-picker and instead act as the **CEO of my portfolio**. My job isn't to analyse 50 different companies but to hire 4-5 of the best professional fund managers in the country to do that work for me.

**The New Strategy: A Disciplined, MF-First Approach**

The first step was to take control. I ended my subscription with the fund manager and decided to go back to first principles. I spent dedicated time learning the fundamentals of long-term investing, not about picking individual stocks, but about sound portfolio construction. Through this research, I developed my own mutual fund selection framework based on clear quantitative (performance, risk ratios) and qualitative (philosophy, manager tenure) metrics.

I've decided to consolidate everything and channel 90% of my monthly equity investments into a core Mutual Fund portfolio.

**Why Not Pick Stocks Actively?** I will still pick stocks, but not as my primary strategy. My direct equity allocation will be managed via a **""Coffee Can / War Chest""** approach. I'll systematically save a small amount into a separate account and deploy it *infrequently* and *opportunistically* into 2-3 high-conviction businesses a year that I plan to hold for 10+ years. This avoids impulsive buying and forces a long-term mindset.

**The Complete Financial Picture**

My new plan recognises that MFs are just one part of the puzzle. The full picture looks like this:

* **Foundation (Low Risk):** I have a solid base in NPS, PPF, FDs, ULIP and Gold. This is my defensive bedrock that allows me to be aggressive elsewhere. (I know ULIP was a mistake, but the math says that the best course of action is to continue)
* **Core Wealth Builder (High Risk):** The 90% allocation of my monthly investments into the MF portfolio detailed below.
* **Satellites (Very High Risk):** A 10% monthly allocation to Crypto (BTC/ETH) and the opportunistic ""Coffee Can"" stock portfolio.

**The Final Mutual Fund Portfolio**

After a rigorous, multi-phase screening process, this is the final 5-fund portfolio I've built.

|Fund Category|Allocation|Fund Name|Role & Rationale|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Large Cap**|20%|**Bandhan Nifty 100 Index Fund**|**The Passive Bedrock.** Captures the market return of India's top 100 companies at a best-in-class expense ratio of 0.10%.|
|**Flexi Cap**|25%|**Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund**|**The Active Core.** A high-quality, value-conscious fund with built-in global diversification, run by a highly respected team.|
|**Mid Cap**|30%|**Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund**|**The Primary Growth Engine.** A high-conviction, concentrated fund with stellar performance metrics, chosen to be the main driver of alpha.|
|**Small Cap**|15%|**Bandhan Small Cap Fund**|**The Potent Accelerator.** An aggressive, high-alpha fund. Chosen after accepting the ""manager tenure risk"" in exchange for superior performance and risk metrics.|
|**International**|10%|**5% S&P 500 + 5% Nasdaq 100**|**The Diversifier & Tech Bet.** A hybrid approach to get broad US market exposure while expressing a bullish view on US tech.|

**My Questions for the Community:**

1. **Fund Selection:** Are there any funds in this final list you would strongly consider replacing? If so, which one, what alternative would you suggest, and what is your reasoning?
2. **Small Cap Rationale:** Regarding the Small Cap choice, I consciously chose Bandhan over others due to its superior risk-adjusted performance, despite the known ""manager tenure risk."" How do you weigh this trade-off between a statistically superior choice and one with a longer, more stable track record?
3. **ETF vs. Index Fund:** On a practical note for my Large Cap allocation, does anyone have a case study or real-world experience comparing a **NIFTY 100 ETF** directly against an **Index Fund**? I'm particularly interested in the effective difference in tracking error, liquidity, and overall costs (including brokerage, STT, etc.) for a long-term SIP investor.
4. **Blind Spots:** Looking at the overall structure and my philosophy, are there any major blind spots or risks you feel I might be overlooking?

I‚Äôm on Vitex and have been for 8 weeks now. I had/have relatively high prolactin, low LH, FSH, oestrogen, testosterone and also low iron and LDL. I suspect I have issues with my thyroid, perhaps Reverse T3, as my TSH levels are showing up clinically fine - I‚Äôve just had a full thyroid panel to see whether my thyroid is functional though.

Since the Vitex, I‚Äôve gained more weight - a total of 7-8kg since coming of birth control (over 15lbs I believe), 3-4kg after Vitex. Is this normal and a transitional period?

I‚Äôm at a complete loss with what to do, I seem to gain more weight, no matter how well I eat, exercise, manage stress, no matter what supplements I take.

For more context, I eat sufficient complex carbs to support ovulation, plenty of protein and healthy fats, I don‚Äôt overeat either, I walk at least 40-60 mins per day despite a sedentary job, I do x2 strength training sessions per week and x2 trail runs per week (7km total usually but 110m elevation).

But for many camels, three minutes is the length of a single ‚Äújoyride‚Äù ‚Äì one of dozens they‚Äôre made to give each day. At popular tourist destinations, these animals work long hours under harsh conditions, often with little rest, in service of their owner‚Äôs livelihood. While we often speak out against domestic abuse and exploitation, we sometimes forget to extend that empathy to beings who can‚Äôt speak our language. During my recent travels across India, I witnessed firsthand the mistreatment of animals, often for tourism ‚Äì a reality that was both unsettling and hard to ignore. One particular incident stayed with me, and I‚Äôd like to share it here. While at a popular tourist spot in Jaipur, Rajasthan, I noticed a trio of camels being used for ‚Äújoyrides‚Äù to a long line of paying tourists (20rs/ride or about 0.25 cents). One of the camels started in a seated position, with its legs folded up and its neck laying flat on the ground; we could see that the camel was visibly exhausted and overworked. Each person would sit on the camel, and experience the thrill of it standing up and taking a 3 minute stroll in its enclosed area. This cycle repeated, with the camel seated, then standing, then seated again, continuously for many hours. At first, we may not even think twice about this overall issue because we may feel blinded by the appeal of a video we can post on Instagram or even the boast of ‚Äúriding a camel.‚Äù Underneath these shallow enticements, however, the camel must bear the weight of countless strangers and constantly be forced to endure this strenuous cycle. We even noticed that one of its legs was visibly shaking and ready to collapse at any given moment, yet it relentlessly picked up its next set of passengers who excitedly sat on the creature‚Äôs back. Another drooped his head low, clearly unable to support the weight of its own neck. People poured into the line one after another, and we were uncertain how much longer the camel could persist. Even simply voicing our concerns was to no avail, as the shopkeeper nodded quietly in agreement but continued the cycle anyways. As a small gesture, we paid five joyrides worth of money to the shopkeeper in return for the Camel to have a fifteen minute rest. While it was a small amount of extra money from our pockets, it was apparent that it meant far more to the camel. In that fifteen minute rest, the camel looked as if it was liberated from its suffering and free in its natural habitat ‚Äì the camel even appeared to extend its shaky neck towards us as a form of gratitude. This moment didn‚Äôt last for long, however ‚Äì the shopkeeper was adamant on returning the camel back to the joyrides. After leaving the area and seeing in the distance yet another group of people excitedly climbing onto the camel‚Äôs back, we felt as if something needed to be done. Each step the beautiful creature took underlied years of neglect and torture that reflected a wake-up-call for change. This blog serves not only to retell the story of that individual Camel, but to shine light upon the millions that are suffering in developing nations every day. We, as humans, should use our influence to live in harmony with the creatures that we are blessed to share the same planet with, not exploit them for personal benefit. Each story we tell, each animal we advocate for, and each dollar we donate to these noble causes plays a substantial role in progressing change on a global scale.

We have published a children‚Äôs book on Amazon called ‚ÄúSaathi the Silent Hero‚Äù it‚Äôs a short read and only $2.99, but we feel that it will impact the many camels struggling with abuse and neglect. All revenue generated will go STRAIGHT to organizations like PETA; none will be kept for ourselves.

At popular tourist destinations, these animals work long hours under harsh conditions, often with little rest, in service of their owner‚Äôs livelihood.
While we often speak out against domestic abuse and exploitation, we sometimes forget to extend that empathy to beings who can‚Äôt speak our language. During my recent travels across India, I witnessed firsthand the mistreatment of animals, often for tourism ‚Äì a reality that was both unsettling and hard to ignore. One particular incident stayed with me, and I‚Äôd like to share it here.
While at a popular tourist spot in Jaipur, Rajasthan, I noticed a trio of camels being used for ‚Äújoyrides‚Äù to a long line of paying tourists (20rs/ride or about 0.25 cents). One of the camels started in a seated position, with its legs folded up and its neck laying flat on the ground; we could see that the camel was visibly exhausted and overworked. Each person would sit on the camel, and experience the thrill of it standing up and taking a 3 minute stroll in its enclosed area. This cycle repeated, with the camel seated, then standing, then seated again, continuously for many hours. At first, we may not even think twice about this overall issue because we may feel blinded by the appeal of a video we can post on Instagram or even the boast of ‚Äúriding a camel.‚Äù Underneath these shallow enticements, however, the camel must bear the weight of countless strangers and constantly be forced to endure this strenuous cycle. We even noticed that one of its legs was visibly shaking and ready to collapse at any given moment, yet it relentlessly picked up its next set of passengers who excitedly sat on the creature‚Äôs back. Another drooped his head low, clearly unable to support the weight of its own neck. 
People poured into the line one after another, and we were uncertain how much longer the camel could persist. Even simply voicing our concerns was to no avail, as the shopkeeper nodded quietly in agreement but continued the cycle anyways. As a small gesture, we paid five joyrides worth of money to the shopkeeper in return for the Camel to have a fifteen minute rest. While it was a small amount of extra money from our pockets, it was apparent that it meant far more to the camel. In that fifteen minute rest, the camel looked as if it was liberated from its suffering and free in its natural habitat ‚Äì the camel even appeared to extend its shaky neck towards us as a form of gratitude. This moment didn‚Äôt last for long, however ‚Äì the shopkeeper was adamant on returning the camel back to the joyrides. After leaving the area and seeing in the distance yet another group of people excitedly climbing onto the camel‚Äôs back, we felt as if something needed to be done. Each step the beautiful creature took underlied years of neglect and torture that reflected a wake-up-call for change. 
This blog serves not only to retell the story of that individual Camel, but to shine light upon the millions that are suffering in developing nations every day. We, as humans, should use our influence to live in harmony with the creatures that we are blessed to share the same planet with, not exploit them for personal benefit. Each story we tell, each animal we advocate for, and each dollar we donate to these noble causes plays a substantial role in progressing change on a global scale. 

We have published a children‚Äôs book on Amazon called ‚ÄúSaathi the Silent Hero‚Äù it‚Äôs a short read and only $2.99, but we feel that it will impact the many camels struggling with abuse and neglect. All revenue generated will go STRAIGHT to organizations like PETA; none will be kept for ourselves. 

Please consider supporting ‚Äî it would mean a lot!

\*Jane\*

I didn't expect to spend my thirtieth birthday like this‚Ä¶ at a party my Alpha mate had thrown ‚Äòfor me', watching him make a fool of himself with another woman on stage.

I clutched a glass of champagne tightly in my hand and my wolf growled to rip that bitch apart. Xander's shirt was half unbuttoned now, his tie long gone, and his cheeks were flushed from drinking too much whiskey. While his Beta Mia shamelessly wrapped her arm around his waist, her slender fingers dancing across his back. They sang together even if their voice was terrible.

She was younger than me, she wore a tight, low-cut dress. The red fabric clung to every curve of her body, the neckline plunging dangerously low. Her blonde hair flowed down her back, teasing my husband's skin every time they made physical contact.

Since three years ago, Mia replace her dead father as Xander's current beta and personal assistant,I watched their professional relationship gradually evolve into something. Little touches escalated into literal groping, small laughs escalated into inside jokes, and late nights at the office discussing ‚Äòpack business' for some reason now required expensive champagne and takeout.

I looked around at the ‚ÄòHappy Birthday to My Luna' balloons decorating the room, how ironic.

Mia leaned against Xander, whispering something in his ear that made he threw his head back in laughter. He looked at her as if she was the funniest person.

I hadn't seen him this happy for a long time.

The last time was seven years ago at our mating ceremony, at that time, the light in his eyes only shining for me.

People around were all laughing but I knew they were actually mocking me. The pack Luna, sitting here while her Alpha pratically groped his Beta in front of everyone.

""Five bucks says Alpha Xander and Beta Mia will kiss before midnight,"" I heard a female voice said.

""Please,"" another one responded. ""They'll do more than just kiss. Have you seen the way he's looking at her?""

I turned around slowly to look at the people speaking, making sure to calm my features. It was two young members who had just joined our pack ‚Äì a blonde and a brunette, both looking barely old enough to drink. I wasn't surprised, as only someone completely ignorant of the company hierarchy would say something like that in front of the Alpha's Luna.

When they finally noticed me staring, instead of showing appropriate respect, she tilted her head and arrogantly asked, ""Do you also work at Blackwood Group?""

I didn't respond. I just stared at them coldly.

Before I was about to retort words that would make them regret someone called out to me.

""Luna Jane! There you are, birthday girl!""

I knew who it was even before I turned. Gamma's daughter Giana. With a champagne flute in hand, her red lips stretched into what most would believe to be a friendly smile. But I knew better.

We all worked for the Blackwood Group, the world leading luxury jewelry company. It was part of being in the pack. Xander was of course as CEO and Alpha, Mia was his devoted beta and ‚Äòindispensable' executive assistance, and Giana was the sales director. Her post was right below me, so she was one of the few people who called me by my name like a friend, even though we weren't friends.

""Giana,"" I nodded at her, as she stopped in front of me.

She air-kissed both of my cheeks, her expensive perfume practically choking me. ""Happy birthday! You have to tell me how it feels to be thirty.""

Don't worry, you'll find out soon, I wanted to say. But instead, I offered a fake smile.

""You know,"" she continued, ""Everyone has been asking about you all night. ‚ÄòWhere's Luna?' ‚ÄòWhen do we get to speak with our Luna?'""

""Is that so?""

""Yes,"" she nodded, ""But it's so difficult for you to get any time with them. No opportunity to chat.""

Her eyes drifted to the stage, and Xander and Mia swayed together, sharing microphones and laughing like they were on a private date rather than a work event.

""By the way,"" Giana began. She dropped her head as if she were telling me a secret. ""What did you think about their performance? The Alpha and Beta have such‚Ä¶ chemistry on stage, don't they?""

Damn bitch. She was mocking me.

Still, I managed a forced smile at Giana. ""That's great. I'm very happy with the surprise my husband prepared for me.""

Before she spit another vicious words, the guests erupted into applause around us for the performance of their Alpha and Beta. I guessed they were done with their nonsense.

But Xander brought the damn microphone back to his lips. ""Thank you, everyone. We're having such a great time that we're going to sing one more song. In honor of my Luna"" He said the last part and points at me.

More applause. More cheers. But I smiled stiffly. All I wanted to go home, and forget about this damn birthday.

Giana looked at me with pity. ""Well, ""she said. ""I'll catch up with you later."" She hurried off.

""Oh shit, she's Luna Jane? No way""

The two blond girls whisper again from behind me.

I turn again and glare at them the last time. They both awkwardly avert their gaze and quietly walk away.

Good.

I turned back to the stage, my heart pounding. The chords of Taylor Swift's ‚ÄòLove Story' began to play.

Mia's eyes locked with Xander's, and her hand was touching his arm, making my stomach twist. She was completely shameless, and he was too drunk to notice‚Äîor worse, he didn't care. I watched Mia's fingers leave my husband's arm, trailing lower and lower, and lower.

I finally snapped.

I let the empty champagne flute crash to the floor as I walked toward the stage. I could sense all eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realized what's happening. They were waiting to see if I would break down, if the nominal Luna would finally drop the mask and accept Mia's humiliation.

But I didn't care. I was done playing the perfect Luna.

Xander didn't even look up when I stopped in front of them. Mia locked gazes with me, but instead of moving away from my husband, she simply straightened up, one hand still resting possessively on his thigh.

""Xander,"" I hissed. ""It's getting late. We should leave.""

He finally looked up, blinking in confusion.

""Leave?"" he slurred the words and gestured with his free hand. ""Come on, Jane. It's your birthday!""

Fuck the birthday.

""We. Are. Leaving,"" I said again. ""Now."" I repeated.

He mumbled like a baby and tries to pull me down to the floor ""Noo, Stay, Have fun with me, don't be such a wet blanket""

The annoyance was obvious in his voice. He looked at me like I was ruining the party.

I didn't say anything., walking backstage, my eyes landing on the event manager who'd been hovering near the sound booth.

""End it,"" I commanded immediately. ""Shut everything down. Now.""

He blinked at me. ""Luna Jane, the party is scheduled until‚Ä¶""

""I don't care when it's scheduled for,"" I cut him off, making him flinch. ""This is my birthday party, and I want it over. Cut the lights, stop the music. All of it.""

He nodded quickly and turned to the technicians, relaying my orders. Within seconds, the light dimmed, the music cut off mid-note and everywhere was silent.

When I walked back to center stage, all that was left was the sound of my high heels. I grabbed my husband's arm and pulled him firmly toward the edge of the stage. ""We're leaving,"" I said, loud enough for those nearby to hear.

Mia started saying something, but one look from me had her sinking back to the bench and shutting her mouth.

""Jane‚Ä¶"" Xander stuttered as he stumbled behind me. He was shocked by my sudden assertiveness, but I wouldn't engage. He was too drunk for me to argue with him.

As if he understood that I was in a sour mood, he became quiet. For once, I was the one in control.

I walked with Xander till we get to our car parked outside. Mike, our driver sees us coming and quickly rushes to open the back seat door. Then he helped me set Xander inside. I entered the passenger seat before slaming the door shut. I sighed, ""Take us home.""

Chapter 2: The Aftermath.

\*Jane\*

I couldn't sleep.

Xander was fast asleep beside me. He'd had no trouble nodding off, obviously not very concerned with the fact that he'd singlehandedly ruined my night.

I traced the sharp line of his jaw with my eyes, trying to search for evidence of his betrayal.

Just say a word, a name. That was all I want.

But there was nothing. Not even a twitch.

Of course not. Xander was extremely calculated, even in sleep. He always wanted to control everything, me included.

My eyes drifted to the dresser, where his phone kept lighting up. I looked back at Xander. Before I could convince myself not to, I reached for his cell.

It felt like I was committing a serious crime as I tapped my finger against the screen. It lit up, but Xander had taken the extra precaution by setting his notifications to private.

The only thing I could see was the sender, and all twenty-something texts‚Ä¶ and counting were coming from the same person. I peered down at the profile picture. It was a tiny, blurry picture even though it looked like Mia.

I spent the entire night spiraling, replaying that horrible birthday party in my head, wondering what was really going on between Mia and Xander.

I eventually gave up on sleep, and dragged myself to the kitchen. By 6 a.m., I'd consumed three cups of coffee.

I looked up when the smell of mints came to my nose. Xander appeared in the kitchen doorway, dark hair disheveled, rubbing his temples.

""Morning,"" he mumbled, shuffling toward the coffee pot. ""Last night was great. You good?""

Was it? I wanted to ask, but instead, I answered, ""Just tired."" I'd tried to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness still managed to slip out.

Xander paused mid-sip, his gray eyes narrowing slightly over the rim of his mug. The kitchen suddenly felt too small, and the tiny peace I'd felt here has vanished completely.

""What's wrong, Jane?"" He dropped his voice, sounding more concerned than he really was.

What's wrong? I almost laughed. I gripped my mug tighter. ""I'm. Fine.""

He frowned again and set his coffee down. ""You don't sound fine."" He reached for the coffee pot, refilled his mug and slid into the chair beside me. ""Talk to me Jane.""

I turned to look at him. My husband. He was devastatingly handsome. Xander was almost a whole foot taller than me, towering over most of the pack. His dark hair fell in tousled waves, still messy from sleep. A lifetime ago, I would have buried my fingers in the silky strands and planted a sweet kiss on his full lips.

Now when I looked into his gray eyes, it felt like I was looking at a stranger. Even the strong line of his jaw, his usual early morning stubble that used to make my knees weak did nothing to me anymore.

As he gazed at me innocently, I found myself transported back to how we'd met at the Werewolf Academy. Eighteen-year-old Xander had been leaning against the brick wall right outside the dining hall. I'd barely even noticed him as I walked past, but he'd spotted me immediately and declared, ""You're mine.""

And like every typical sixteen year old would, I laughed in his face. I'd believed he was feeding me some elaborate line, toying with my feelings. I didn't even sense any sort of partner relationship between us.

""You're lying,"" I'd told him flatly. ""You don't even know me.""

But that didn't deter him. He spent months pursuing me relentlessly. He would slip notes into my textbooks, get me coffee, escort me to and from class. He was attentive, caring‚Ä¶ just perfect.

I finally cracked and agreed to be his girlfriend. But with a condition. ""If I find my destined partner when I turn eighteen, I'm breaking up with you,"" I'd said to him. Xander grinned with so much confidence I almost took the words back. ""Agreed. But you won't want to.""

He was right. On my eighteenth birthday, when my wolf finally roared to summon her mate, I'd felt that unique sensation directed at none other than Xander. It made me the happiest person in the world.

Now, that memory tasted bitter in my mouth. It was tainted by his involvement with his Beta and how that had turned me into a laughing stock.

""You embarrassed me last night,"" I finally blurted. I set my mug down hard enough that coffee spilled over the rim. ""And what was that karaoke performance with Mia? Everyone was watching.""

His jaw tightened at the mention of her name. ""God, jane. You always do this‚Ä¶ make trouble out of nothing.""

""Nothing? You think it's nothing?""

""Do you know how many women would kill for your life?"" He gestured around our large kitchen with its marble countertops and advanced appliances. ""I've given you everything. Luna title. This house. The cars. The vacations.""

What was he even talking about?

""And it's never enough."" He ran his hands through his hair in frustration. ""It's always Mia this, Mia that. She‚Äôs my Beta. I'm tired of it Jane. So damn tired.""

This was my fault now? After everything he'd put me through?.

I glared at him for a moment. But I also knew that if I pushed further, he'd reach for his phone and call my mother. She never took my side, and thought it was my luck to marry Xander. After all, she couldn‚Äôt live without Xander‚Äôs money.

‚ÄúSo how would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?‚Äù

He sighed. ""I don't want to argue with you, Jane. Actually‚Ä¶"" he paused, straightening his shoulders. ""There's something I need to discuss with you. I've been thinking it's time.""

My stomach dropped. This was it. Xander was about to ask for a divorce. Mom was going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Paris next month.

But when Xander opened his mouth, he said, ""I think we should consider an open marriage.""

I sat still, waiting for the punchline, because it had to be a joke. But his expression remained serious. It finally dawned on me. Xander was not joking.

""Absolutely not,"" I yelled. ""Are you out of your mind?""

""I'm not asking for your opinion, Jane. I'm telling you what's going to happen.""

I couldn't believe what was happening. A divorce would have been much better than this. But I just had to know‚Ä¶ ""Why?""

He looked away before answering. ""I want a pup. It's been seven years. Blackwood couldn't be without an heir.""

My mouth flew open. Did he wake up with the sole purpose of hurting me? I knew what that statement meant. My inability to conceive had made me a failure. Eight rounds of IVF, eight times I'd put my body through hell, and eight times we'd failed.

""How dare you say that to me?"" I hissed. ""That's not my fault!""

""Jane‚Ä¶ you need to calm down.""

""The doctor always says we're both healthy."" My voice broke. ""Just the embryos are‚Ä¶ unusual.""

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault either. Maybe it‚Äôs just us together.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe he said that.

I reached for the buttons of my blouse, let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I was standing naked in front of him. ""I can try again."" I leaned into him, grabbed his hand and placed it over my chest. ""Does this not move you anymore?""

Xander's face hardened into something I didn't recognize.

‚ÄúJane‚Äù He snatched his hand away from me and rose to his feet. ""Put your clothes on, Jane. This isn't about sex."" He turned away from me as if the sight was distasteful and grabbed his keys from the counter.

I fumbled with my clothes. ""Where are you going?""

He didn't look back. ""Out!"" He walked away, toward the stairs.

""Wait,"" I shouted, my voice shaking.

Xander turned around, impatient. ""What?""

""Let‚Äôs do it. The open marriage.""

""Good"" He said before left.

\--

I spent the next couple of hours pacing in the kitchen, drowning myself in coffee while wild thoughts ran through my head. When the door finally opened again, I was sitting at the kitchen table, coffee mug in hand. Xander walked in first.

""Hey,"" I began. ""We should‚Ä¶"" I turned my attention back to the door at the sound of heels. Mia walked in, wearing her signature low-cut dress, wheeling a large suitcase behind her.

No.

""Jane,"" Xander said casually as if this was completely normal. ""Mia's moving in. She's my girlfriend now.""

I had always prided myself on my ability to remain calm regardless of what was going on. But for the first time in my life, I understood what it meant to want someone dead.

Chapter 3: Cast Aside.

\*Jane\*

When Mia stepped through the kitchen door, I was shocked and confused. The sight of her, grinning like this was her home. My wolf howled in outrage inside me. I couldn't believe he actually went through with this. I'd technically agreed to it, but I never truly thought he would bring her here. ""You can't be serious. Xander.""

""I'm very serious,"" he replied, taking Mia's suitcase and setting it down with a thud as if to say she was here to stay.

But she can't. I won't accept it. I moved to block the staircase. ""I'm the Luna of this pack and I won't allow it.""

They exchanged glances and simply walked around me like I was nothing more than furniture.

""I am your Alpha."" His alpha tone made me winch. ""It's my house. I provide you with a place to stay. If you don't like the arrangement, you're free to leave.""

I stood there, paralyzed to the spot. I replayed the entire morning in my head. How did things escalate so quickly?

As if they hadn't hurt me enough already, Mia turned to face me, her smile reeking of triumph. ""You'll need to move to the guest room, Jane. I'm not sharing a bed with you and Xander.""

I couldn't breathe. And what was even worse? Xander was right. I couldn't do anything about it.

I could only stand there, frozen and hollow as they disappeared into our bedroom. The door closed with a soft click that somehow felt worse than if it had slammed. I could hear them whispering and laughing, and that finally pulled me out of whatever kept me rooted in place.

I rushed through the hallway and out of the pack house, not bothering to close the door behind me. I stumbled into the garage, barely even standing on my feet.

Vitto, Xander's bodyguard, stood by the cars. His head snapped up as I walked in, eyes widening as he took in my disheveled appearance.

‚ÄúLuna, you-‚Äù

I extended my trembling hand. ""The keys. I need the Rolls-Royce.""

His brows knitted together. ""Alpha Xander didn't mention‚Ä¶""

""The keys, Vitto,"" I commanded, adding more force to my voice. ""Now.""

He hesitated for a bit before retrieving them from the lockbox and handing it to me. I pulled it from his grasp and jumped into the car. Vitto's worried expression in my rearview mirror was the last thing I saw before reversing out of the garage.

I drove without destination for over an hour, mind spinning. All I could see was Xander and that bitch.

I'd planned to get a manicure today. I could firmly say that I was no longer in the mood. I couldn't help but wonder how long he'd been planning this. He'd mentioned open marriage just a couple of hours ago and now he'd actually brought his lover home.

What disturbed me the most was how empty I felt inside. I couldn't cry. Couldn't scream. I was numb. My previous pack psychologist had called it a ‚Äòdefense mechanism.' ""You're denying your true feelings,"" she'd insisted during our sessions. ""Cry it out, Jane""

She might have been right, but right now, I didn't want to pay attention to anyone's opinion.

I just wanted a drink.

Without overthinking it, I pulled the car into the hidden lot behind Moonfall. I'd discovered the bar three years ago after a particularly vicious fight with Xander. This place has become my favorite bar since then. It was located on the very outskirts of werewolf city, hidden down an unmarked road. Particularly, there were no paparazzi lurking around, meaning no headlines like, ""Blackwood Pack's Luna Spotted Drinking Alone, Rumored Marriage Trouble with Alpha Xander.""

The moment I pushed the door open, the scent of shape-shifters from various clans hit me. Here, pack hierarchies and politics didn't matter, we were just ourselves. Unlike the pretentious establishments in the city where werewolves flaunted their status and treated other shapeshifters with disdain, Moonfall welcomed all.

I slid onto the leather barstool and caught the bartender's eye. ""Whiskey. Neat. And keep it coming.""

The bear shifter bartender, a huge man with a thick beard nodded and placed a heavy crystal tumbler in front of me. He poured my drink and leaned forward. ""Rough day?""

I took a long sip, sighing as the liquor burned the back of my throat. ""Not interested in talking.""

He shrugged. ""Fair enough. Name's Bob if you change your mind.""

I nodded at him and went back to my drink. I understood bartender's liked to listen to customer's, but now, I just wanted to lick my wounds alone.

I'd just finished my second drink when strong arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind. I stiffened instantly.

""Kate! There you are, sweetheart!"" A foreign deep voice said almost too loudly, as if he wanted someone to hear him.

The tall, handsome stranger slid onto the stool beside me. He smelled of pine forests after rain, a scent that made my wolf stir with unexpected interest. He was a werewolf too. I looked up at him, and almost did a double take. He was handsome, painfully so.

He had raven black hair, dreamy blue eyes, full kissable lips, set into what looked like a permanent smile. He was looking at me in such a way that almost made me weak in the knees. Almost.

The man suddenly leaned in close, grabbing my hands. ""Play along. I'll explain later.""

Before I could respond, a furious looking woman stormed across the bar toward us. ""Aaron!"" she snapped. ""So this is why you've been ignoring my calls?""

The stranger, Aaron, tightened his grip on me. ""You shouldn't be doing this in front of my wife.""

I didn't think her voice could get louder, but it did. ""Your wife?!""

He lifted my left hand where Xander's wedding ring was. ""Yes, Hazel. My wife.""

Her face suddenly twisted in disgust as she turned to face me. ""Seriously? You married this scumbag?""

""Hey!"" Aaron yelled. ""You can't talk to my wife like that.""

But her attention didn't shift from me. ""You can't see what your jerk of a husband did?"" I stared blankly at her, waiting for her to explain. ""He disappeared after we slept together. Not even a text! Just vanished like it meant nothing!""

Aaron looked deep into my eyes and brought my hands to his chest. He was trying real hard to sell this apologetic husband story. Xander needed to learn a thing or two from him. ""Because it didn't mean anything,"" Aaron replied, his eyes still on mine. ""It was a one-night stand. Just one night.""

""You absolute jerk! You made me believe‚Ä¶""

He held up a hand. ""I never promised you anything.""

""Go to hell,"" she spat at him. And then she turned to face me, eyes filled with pity and contempt. ""Good luck with your marriage to this piece of trash."" She stormed toward the exit, shouldering past a group of fox shifters.

Everything happened so fast that I sat frozen, my whiskey completely forgotten.

Aaron released my hand and exhaled dramatically. ""Thank the moon goddess that's over."" He ran his fingers through his dark hair. ""Sorry about dragging you into that. She's been following me for weeks. Showed up at my workplace yesterday.""

I blinked at him, still trying to process what had just happened. The confrontation had pulled me out of my misery for a moment, but I could feel it returning slowly.

He turned toward the bar, lifting his hand to signal Bruno. ""Let me buy you a drink. You definitely earned it, playing along like that.""

I stared at him, then glanced toward the door where Hazel had disappeared. The whole encounter had lasted maybe two minutes, but I was still dumbfounded.

My glass was empty. My marriage was in shambles. What could I possibly lose by having a drink with a handsome stranger? ""Let's get two glasses.""

Aaron grinned at me then turned to Bob. ""Two glasses it is.""

Chapter 4: A Crazy Plan.

\*Aaron\*

I could sit here and say that recruiting the help of this woman in avoiding Hazel was all a crazy coincidence, but that would be a lie.

I spotted her the moment I walked into the bar. She wasn‚Äôt just the most beautiful woman I‚Äôd ever seen, she was unique. Her scent hit me suddenly, almost knocking off the fragile bar stool. My wolf howled inside me, clawing at my chest in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. I shifted uncomfortably, surprised by my reaction.

The platinum band had been a disappointing surprise. Whoever her husband was, he better thank the moon goddess. He‚Äôs a damn lucky bastard.

The last time my wolf had been this restless was the night I met my mate Yve.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve been introduced. I‚Äôm Aaron.‚Äù

‚ÄúI gathered.‚Äù

Right. Hazel had been yelling my name with so much rage. ‚ÄúGreat. It‚Äôs only fair if you tell me yours‚Ä¶ even the playing field a little.‚Äù

She finally turned to face me, assessing me quietly. She said nothing, her eyes meeting mine for a second, maybe two. But it was enough.

Her lips parted slightly and I caught myself staring, mesmerized by the subtle curve of her mouth.

Shit. She probably thinks I was trying to flirt with her. I raised my hands in mock surrender, leaning away from her. ‚ÄúJust to be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to flirt. Women are‚Ä¶‚Äù I chuckled, shaking my head, ‚Äúfrankly, troublesome.‚Äù

She arched an eyebrow, letting me know I‚Äôd said the wrong thing. ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she said flatly. ‚ÄúYou just happened to use a complete stranger as a shield against some innocent ex. Because all men are the same, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Before I could defend myself, she turned away, reached for her glass of whiskey sitting on the bar and downed it in one gulp. My eyes widened, but I decided it was smart not to comment on it.

Instead, I extended my hand, determined to salvage something from this trainwreck. ‚ÄúAnd for what it‚Äôs worth, that woman wasn‚Äôt an ex.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

Great. Another woman convinced me I was the villain. Not even five minutes of conversation and she‚Äôd already filed me under ‚Äúproblems to avoid.‚Äù

And the worst part? I couldn‚Äôt even blame her. I definitely deserved that.

We didn‚Äôt speak for the next couple of minutes, and I took that time to study her. At first glance, she didn‚Äôt look like just anybody. There was something in her posture, the designer clothes, her expensive perfume and the way others in the room kept glancing at her. Probably the wife of some CEO, someone with status among the pack.

‚ÄúSo, are you going to tell me your name?‚Äù I asked, trying again. ""You don't have to tell me your last name,"" I said, smiling. ""But you look like you need someone to talk to. Since you have just saved my life, I suppose it is the least I can do.""

‚ÄúJane,‚Äù she finally conceded. She sighed and took a sip of the second glass of whiskey. ‚ÄúMy name is Jane.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice to meet you, Jane,‚Äù I said, extending my hand.

She took it.

As the night went on, and Jane consumed her fifth glass of whiskey, she loosened up. She couldn't stop telling her life story as if we had known each other for years. I'd already asked the bartender to interrupt her, but she hadn't noticed.

‚ÄúXander doesn‚Äôt even try to hide it anymore,‚Äù she said, staring into her sixth, maybe seventh glass of whiskey. ‚ÄúBrought her into our home today. That bitch even made me move out of our bedroom. Can you believe that?‚Äù

A low growl threatened to escape me. My wolf didn‚Äôt like that one bit. Something protective flared in my chest. ‚ÄúHe let this happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶‚Äù she stopped instantly, coughing severely. Her shoulders were shaking intensely. I believed it was the cough, but when she looked up, her eyes were shining. ‚ÄúHe suggested it.‚Äù

She broke into a sob after that, drowning the sound with another gulp. Once she‚Äôd emptied her glass, she reached for the bottle, but I pushed it out of her reach and placed my hand over hers. ‚ÄúMaybe we should slow down. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs helping.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to tell me how to live my life,‚Äù Jane snapped, pulling her hand away from mine. She turned toward the bar. ‚ÄúBob! Another round.‚Äù

Bob glanced over, his eyes flickering between Jane and me. He hesitated, waiting for my permission.

I sighed. She was definitely as drunk as a skunk. ‚ÄúBob won‚Äôt be pouring that.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe values his job too much?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what does it have to do with you?‚Äù

I shrugged, the corner of my mouth quirking up. ‚ÄúI own the place.‚Äù

Her eyes widened slightly as she gave me a once over. Then she stood, swaying dangerously. ‚ÄúWell then, I guess I just have to find another bar.‚Äù

I caught her elbow gently as she tried to step past me. It didn‚Äôt take much effort anyways. ‚ÄúJane, wait. Please.‚Äù something in my voice must have reached her. She paused, but didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúHave you considered divorce? No one deserves what he‚Äôs putting you through.‚Äù

‚ÄúDivorce? You think I haven‚Äôt thought of that?‚Äù she sank back onto her stool. ‚ÄúWe have complicated interests. He is my mate. I can‚Äôt leave. My family depends on Xander‚Äôs money.‚Äù

I studied her face as she spoke. Beneath the anger and humiliation, there was something painful in her eyes, something I hadn‚Äôt expected to see. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your life, no one should make you be like this.‚Äù

She gave a sarcastic smile. ‚ÄúEasy for you to say, Mr. Owner.‚Äù

I'd seen people like Jane who won't leave a toxic relationship because they still loved each other. She said it was because of her family, but I could tell it was more than that. She was not ready to let go. That was love -- it made you hold on even when you shouldn't. I knew that feeling too well.

An idea formed in my head. It was stupid and reckless, but before I could stop myself, I said, ‚ÄúWhat if you reminded him?‚Äù I leaned in closer. ‚ÄúYou should find yourself a boyfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúBoyfriend?‚Äù She looked at me, thinking I was crazy. It sounded like a dumb idea, but one thing I knew about cheated men was that they couldn't stand being cheated on. It would drive him crazy. I hoped Xander divorced her because she was too timid to do it herself.

‚ÄúNot a real relationship. Just hire one to play that role until Xander came back to his senses.‚Äù

Jane‚Äôs eyes lit up for the first time all night. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ actually not a bad idea.‚Äù she tapped her finger against her glass. ‚ÄúBut where would I even find someone willing to do that? It‚Äôs not exactly a standard job listing.‚Äù

I felt my pulse quicken. My mouth opened before my brain could intervene. ‚ÄúI could do it.‚Äù

Jane‚Äôs eyebrows shot up in utter disbelief. ‚ÄúYou? Why would you want to get involved in this mess?‚Äù

I shrugged, trying to look as casual as possible. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got time. And honestly? Your husband sounds like he could use a wake-up call.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. I‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused, staring down at her hands. She looked suspicious for a moment, but then she managed a grateful smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd pay you, of course. Generously.‚Äù

I nearly laughed. I didn‚Äôt care about money, I didn‚Äôt even need it. I had enough to last me a lifetime. But I decided to humor her. ‚ÄúSure. whatever you think is fair.‚Äù That made things simpler, less personal. Refusing payment would only make her more suspicious.

She nodded, suddenly all business-like. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll need to plan this carefully. I‚Äôll contact you when I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù She pulled out her phone and we exchanged numbers.

As I walked her to the door, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel concerned for her. ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay to drive? I could call you a car.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù she insisted, fishing for the keys from her purse. She hopped into her Rolls Royce and turned to look at me one last time. ‚ÄúI know my limits.‚Äù

She drove off with more steadiness than I‚Äôd expected. Maybe I‚Äôd been stupid to even worry. But as I watched her car disappear down the road, that was when it dawned on me. My wolf paced restlessly inside me.What the hell was I thinking? What kind of trouble have I gotten myself into?

Chapter 5: Surprise, Surprise.

\*Jane\*

I woke up with a splitting headache. ‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶‚Äù I grunted at the ray of sunlight spilling into the room. I forced my eyes open, I was in my living room.

How did I even get home? The drive was a total blur. I remembered nothing. I pushed myself up with a groan, steadying myself against the headboard. I managed a glance out the window where I spotted Xander‚Äôs Rolls Royce parked in the driveway, without a scratch.

Thank the moon goddess. At least I hadn‚Äôt ruined his precious car.

I muttered as I tasted the bile rising up in my throat. My mouth tasted like something nasty had crawled up and died inside.

I staggered to my feet, pausing for a moment until the room stopped spinning. I desperately needed to shower. So I gripped the banister and made my way to the master bedroom one step at a time.

I froze when I opened the door. Xander‚Äôs head snapped up. Beside him, Mia‚Äôs blonde hair spilled across my pillow (MY PILLOW) her naked body tangled with his beneath sheets I‚Äôd picked out. I could feel my wolf erupt in anger, clawing at my insides.

I screamed.

Mia let out a scream and fell off him, struggling to cover herself. But even as she did so, I could see the triumph in her eyes.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck Jane!‚Äù Xander barked in annoyance. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you heard of knocking?‚Äù

I wanted to tell him this was my bed, my bedroom. I‚Äôd never knocked on any door in this house before, but what was the point? So, instead, I said, ‚ÄúI just needed to get something.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, honey.‚Äù I looked up to see Mia looking at me with false sympathy, her head tilted as if she was speaking to a child. ‚ÄúAll your things were moved to the guest room.‚Äù She emphasized ‚Äòguest‚Äô like I was some unwelcome visitor. ‚ÄúI took care of it yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow thoughtful,‚Äù I hissed.

Xander didn‚Äôt even look at me. ‚ÄúClose the door on your way out.‚Äù

I nodded stiffly. My wolf paced, teeth bared. If I stay in this hallway one more second, my wolf would take over me and riped that bitch apart. I turned to leave, struggling to keep my anger in check. Good job, Jane.

When I finally opened the guest room door, I froze. My clothes were scattered across the floor, dresser drawers left open and emptied. My books had been dumped in a careless pile, family photos tossed aside like trash. Mia hadn‚Äôt ‚Äòmoved‚Äô my things. She‚Äôd ransacked them.

I ignored everything and dragged myself to the bathroom. I was too exhausted to deal with that situation. It would have to wait. But the moment I was safe in the shower and the hot water touched my skin, I let go.

The sound of the water was like white noise, drowning out my unwanted sobs. I won‚Äôt cry for Xander. I won‚Äôt cry for Mia.

After the therapeutic shower, I wandered into the kitchen. ‚ÄúMelina?‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning Luna, hope you sleep well?‚Äù Melina glaced at me.

‚ÄúLike a baby‚Äù I lied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starving‚Äù

‚ÄúFood will be ready soon, please take a seat.‚Äù

My stomach growled in anticipation of what was to come. But when I sat at the counter, Melina placed a plate in front of me with nothing but a few lettuce leaves.

I stared at the sad arrangement, wondering if it was some kind of joke. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

Melina‚Äôs eyes darted nervously toward the doorway before she leaned closer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Luna Jane. Beta Mia instructed that we‚Äôre only to have low-have calorie options from now on.‚Äù

So that was what we were doing now? Resorting to intimidation tactics? That little snake is stirring up a war. First my husband, then my bedroom, now my kitchen.

Melina‚Äôs voice dropped to a whisper, ‚ÄúAlpha Xander threatened to let me go if I didn‚Äôt follow her instructions exactly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he now?‚Äù Melina nodded. She looked genuinely distressed. I couldn‚Äôt blame her. She‚Äôd been with us for five years longer than Mia had been in Xander‚Äôs life.

Well, let‚Äôs begin the games.

I forced myself to eat the tasteless vegetables, my mind racing back to last night. Should I call Aaron now? Could it actually work? Making Xander jealous seemed like a high school tactic, but I was desperate enough to try anything.

I pulled out my phone, fingers hovering above the screen for a second before typing: Hi, I‚Äôm the drunk lady last night. Made it home safe. Car unscathed. Thanks for last night. We should talk about that plan soon. I hit send before I could change my mind.

My phone buzzed almost immediately. Aaron‚Äôs name flashed on the screen: Sorry, who is this?

Oh, my God. He didn't remember me. This was awkward.

Just kidding. Glad you and the Rolls Royce survived. When do we start Operation Jealousy?

\* Sigh \* Eh. He was unbearable.

A rebellious smile tugged at my lips just as the sound of footsteps filled the room. I quickly pocketed my phone. Xander and Mia descended like royalty, her hand possessively wrapped around his. Her flowing silk robe, my silk robe trailed behind her as they entered the kitchen.

‚ÄúGood morning, Jane,‚Äù Mia chirped innocently. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs breakfast? Isn‚Äôt you just wonderful with the new menu I designed?‚Äù

Designed is a pretty strong word for whatever Melina had served me. Melina‚Äôs eyes flickered to mine as she silently placed identical plates of lettuce in front of the happy couple.

Mia beamed at her creation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a detoxifying micro-salad. Perfect for purifying the body.‚Äù She turned to Xander. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it delicious, baby?‚Äù

Xander stared at the plate. I knew him well enough to know that that tick in his jaw was disgust. He stabbed at a ;eaf and chewed with visible effort. ‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù The word was strained. ‚ÄúDelicious.‚Äù But his eyes swept through the kitchen, as if he was looking for something else to eat.

Perfect. Now, it's time to give him something else to choke on.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking,‚Äù I began. All three faces turned toward me. ‚ÄúAbout last night and everything. I know you‚Äôve made me feel‚Ä¶ uncomfortable.‚Äù I looked directly at Xander. ‚ÄúBut you know what? You‚Äôre not worth it.‚Äù

Xander galced at me warily, sensing something‚Äôs off.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my alpha, my husband. Everyone has the right to fulfill their own wishes. Even if those wishes seem‚Ä¶ meaningless to others.‚Äù I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôve decided to fully embrace our new arrangement. This house is certainly big enough for all of us.‚Äù

Xander shifted uncomfortably. He studied me quietly. I wasn‚Äôt surprised. After all these years, he could tell when I was talking nonsense.

Mia clapped her hands in excitement, practically bouncing in her seat. ‚ÄúOh, Jane! I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre being reasonable about this.‚Äù She reached across the table to squeeze my hand, which I subtly moved away to adjust my napkin.

‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the twenty-first century after all. The era of being bound to just one mate is so outdated.‚Äù She turned to Xander for confirmation. ‚ÄúWerewolves could have more than one mate. It‚Äôs our nature.‚Äù

I smiled. They had no idea what was coming for them. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Mia.‚Äù I widened my smile. ‚ÄúWhich is why I‚Äôve also gotten myself a boyfriend.‚Äù

The kitchen fell silent. Xander froze, his fork suspended halfway to his mouth, a piece of lettuce dangling in the air. ‚ÄúBoyfriend?‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs eyes widened.

I leaned back in my chair, savoring the moment like it was the hearty breakfast I‚Äôd desperately needed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right dear.‚Äù I picked up a lettuce leaf with my fingers and bit into it. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs fair, don‚Äôt you? If you want to explore‚Ä¶‚Äù I fixed my gaze on Xander. ‚ÄúThen so do I.‚Äù",1,1753250633.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Headed to Toadstool Cafe for an 11:15 reservation. 
Loved the theming! 
Favorites were the mushroom soup and the Lemon Honey Mango Stars soda. 


After lunch at around 12 lines we‚Äôre really picking up.  Many of the same rides we breezed through had 55+ min lines! 

We decided to do Jurassic Park because it was the lowest wait for a major attraction. It was posted at 35 min but took about 20-25! 

We went back to Harry Potter and did the wand experience which was awesome. My kids each got a wand and we spent time doing magic there, getting candy and treats at Honey Dukes (liked the chocolate frog; disliked the butter beer fudge) 

Walked back to the Hilton + napped for a few hours. Went to dinner at City Walk and walked back in the park at 8:30

Rode Mummy 5 min wait
Rode Mummy again 1 min wait! 

Walked out at 9 and shopped in the gift shops on the way out! Great day.

Trip was 3 full days plus evening before at the trailhead, and 4th day breakfast. I planned for a full day extra rations since our ride out was not 100%. Experienced the full range of weather, from sweltering to cold and wet. Stayed hydrated - 4L day 1, 3L days 2-3. Photo 2 is what‚Äôs left of the food ‚Äî about a days worth, minus coffee. Oatmeal, 1Tbsp pb, 1 Tsp jam, 1.5 slices rye bread, fruit bar, sidekick dinner, couple caramels, jerky, miso soup, mios. 

I was very happy but tending towards slightly hungry at all times on the trail.

Had a pub meal and beer off the trail, a big dinner tonight and rampant snacking, still down 1.5lbs after 2 days recovery. So my hunger was warranted. 

Lessons: I don‚Äôt really like mio. instant coffee is totally fine (sorry aeropress). Miso was clutch on cold evenings - could have portioned it, but that seemed messy.

For most trekkers, the journey begins with a dramatic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. However, flying into one of the world‚Äôs most dangerous airports isn‚Äôt for everyone. If you‚Äôre an adventurous soul looking for an alternative or if the Lukla flights are delayed or canceled (a common occurrence), don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî **you can still trek to Everest Base Camp without flying to Lukla**.

At **Himalayan Asia Treks**, we offer safe, scenic, and culturally rich alternatives to reach Everest Base Camp without taking the Lukla flight. In this article, we‚Äôll explore **how to reach Everest Base Camp by road**, including **popular routes from Jiri and Phaplu**, what to expect, and why this is a unique and rewarding experience.

# üß≠ Why Avoid the Lukla Flight?

While the flight to Lukla saves time, it‚Äôs not always convenient or available. Here are common reasons to skip it:

* **Weather-related cancellations:** Lukla airport is notorious for flight delays due to unpredictable mountain weather.
* **Fear of flying in small aircrafts:** Not everyone feels comfortable flying in a tiny plane over rugged terrain.
* **Desire for a more immersive experience:** The overland trek lets you explore more of rural Nepal, rich in culture and tradition.

# üöê Alternative Ways to Reach Everest Base Camp Without Flying to Lukla

# 1. Jiri to Everest Base Camp Trek (The Classic Route)

Before the Lukla airport was built, all Everest expeditions started from **Jiri**. This traditional route is longer but incredibly scenic.

# üó∫Ô∏è Jiri to Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary (Approx. 22‚Äì24 Days):

* **Day 1‚Äì2**: Drive from Kathmandu to Jiri or Bhandar (8‚Äì10 hours)
* **Day 3‚Äì7**: Trek through beautiful villages: Sete, Junbesi, Nunthala, and Kharikhola
* **Day 8**: Reach Phakding and join the classic EBC trail
* **Day 9‚Äì18**: Continue to Namche, Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Everest Base Camp
* **Day 19‚Äì22**: Return trek to Lukla (and drive out via Phaplu or walk back the same route)

# üåü Highlights:

* Walk in the footsteps of Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary
* Encounter fewer trekkers and more authentic Sherpa culture
* Rich biodiversity through mid-hill forests, terraced farms, and mountain passes

# 2. Phaplu to Everest Base Camp Trek (Shorter Overland Route)

Phaplu is another great starting point, located south of Lukla. You can **drive from Kathmandu to Phaplu** in about 8‚Äì10 hours or fly on more reliable domestic routes.

# üó∫Ô∏è Phaplu to Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary (Approx. 16‚Äì18 Days):

* **Day 1**: Drive or fly from Kathmandu to Phaplu
* **Day 2‚Äì4**: Trek via Ringmo and Kharikhola to meet the main EBC trail in Surke or Phakding
* **Day 5‚Äì13**: Continue on the classic trail to Namche, Tengboche, and Everest Base Camp
* **Day 14‚Äì18**: Return via the same route or opt for helicopter return

# üåü Highlights:

* Avoid the stress of Lukla flights but still enjoy the Khumbu region
* Explore lesser-known villages
* Great for trekkers who want an offbeat yet shorter trail

I had been a wife. A partner. A best friend. Now I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore. The silence was unbearable. Even prayer felt like I was talking into a void. I didn‚Äôt feel angry at God, just invisible.

# The Weather Of The Annapurna Base Camp In June

¬†

The month of June provides a lot of rain to the area. This makes the trails slick and muddy, increasing the chances of injuries and accidents along the way. In the Annapurna region‚Äôs upper northern reaches, the odds of precipitation are slim. The lower region, on the other hand, experiences considerable rains in the mornings and evenings.

There‚Äôs a good risk that planes will be delayed or perhaps canceled. Avalanches and landslides can be dangerous for hikers. Flora and fauna, on the other hand, acquire a new lease on life during this season. The lush greenery along the walk will captivate you, especially if you are a botany fan.

In addition, there are rain shadows places in the area. There are fewer chances of heavy rain in the first week of June. In some places in June, spring weather can still be found. However, by mid-June, the weather has turned into a monsoon, and landslides and avalanches have occurred in the area. As a result, you should check the weather forecast before embarking on your hiking expedition.

You must also be cautious of the slick terrain and leeches. In June, the temperature in the ABC region ranges from 3 to 16 degrees Celsius. During the day, you may encounter hot, damp, and humid conditions. The temperature in the region drops dramatically at night, making it much cooler.

¬†

# Why Take The Annapurna Base Camp Trek In June?

¬†

In the Annapurna region, June is the off-season for trekking. There are, however, a number of reasons why you should trek this month. The following are a few of them:

¬†

# Quiet And Peaceful Trails

¬†

Because it is the offseason, there are fewer trekkers. The quieter, less congested routes offer a relaxing adventure in a serene setting. This Annapurna Base Camp hike in June is great for those who enjoy trekking without being disturbed.

One of the delights of this journey is the beautiful vistas of the Himalayan scenery. Natural sounds such as water running and birds chirping can be heard in the area.

¬†

# Magical Views Of The Snow-Capped Mountains

¬†

After a period of severe rain, the sky clears, revealing magnificent vistas of the mountains. You can also take in the beauty of the green landscape all around you. Along the path, the bright blue skies and unimpeded views of Annapurna South, Hiunchuli, and other peaks will mesmerize you.

¬†

# Gorgeous Sunrise Vista

¬†

The afternoons and nights are cloudy, with heavy rain falling all day and night. However, the skies are clear early in the morning, giving you spectacular vistas of the mountain summits. A once-in-a-lifetime event is witnessing a golden sunrise over silver mountains, making them golden. The region‚Äôs green hills, wide meadows, and water streams are all stunning.

¬†

# Discount And Bargain Offers

¬†

During the off-season, backpackers can save money. Similarly, during the off-season, the cost of lodging and transportation will be greatly reduced. During this season, trekkers will receive exceptional savings.

Because there will be fewer people, you will have more options for lodging and dining. If you‚Äôre good at haggling, you‚Äôll earn even more savings. Some tea houses will also provide free lodging if you agree to eat your meals at the same teahouse.

¬†

# Variety Of Food And Accommodation

¬†

In most stretches of the path, the tea houses and lodges are deserted. You can select your preferred room and pay a reasonable amount for it. Blankets, electronic charging, hot water, and other amenities will be provided to trekkers.

You are not required to share rooms. Solo rooms with attached bathrooms are also available without having to wait in huge lineups. However, because there are no transit amenities in the higher elevation communities, they will cost you more. A porter or a yak is required to transport food ingredients.

You‚Äôll be fed Nepalese ‚ÄúDal Bhat,‚Äù a nutritious dinner that will keep you energized. To combat altitude sickness, you must stay hydrated with fluids and drink at least 2-3 liters of water. Similarly, you can even carry your own water bottle.

¬†

# Difficulties Of Annapurna Base Camp In June

¬†

The Annapurna Base Camp trek is a difficult journey for people of all ages and abilities. These hiking paths are tough if you have never walked at a high altitude previously. Trekkers should plan on hiking for about 6-7 hours per day. The monsoon season adds to the difficulty by bringing heavy rain and slick trails.

There are also leech-infested pathways, which adds to the difficulty. Another important aspect of this walk is physical strength, stamina, and a basic degree of fitness. As a result, proper training is an essential element of your preparation. Altitude sickness is a significant concern for trekkers on this trail, as it passes to altitudes of 5000 m and above.

Before beginning your walk, be sure you don‚Äôt have any underlying heart conditions. The need of acclimatization and hydration at frequent settlements cannot be overstated. In the high altitude region, dehydration can produce altitude sickness. As a result, these are some of the Annapurna base camp trek‚Äôs challenges in June.

¬†

# Food And Accommodation On The Trek

¬†

The Annapurna Base Camp trip is a lovely journey that takes you through stunning scenery. Meals and lodging, including the room of your choice, are available at low prices. There are other amenities such as an adjoining bathroom, hot showers, heated heaters, Wi-Fi, charging, and so on.

‚ÄúDal Bhat‚Äù is a traditional Nepalese dish that is served for lunch and dinner twice a day. The high-calorie meal is great since it provides energy for the strenuous hike. Hydration is critical, and you can clean water with purification pills or chlorine solutions. Tea, garlic soup, coffee, rhododendron tea, mint tea, and other hot beverages are also available.

These types of accommodations are also available at discounted rates during the off-season. Some teahouses also provide free lodging, but you must eat your meals at the same teahouse. You can also bring protein bars, granola bars, chocolate bars, and other energy snacks with you on your trek.

I just want to share a bit of appreciation and positivity for the company that gets up and makes us coffee every morning.

Put yourself in my shoes.

Lately, it feels like you're returning more than you're buying. You spend hours sifting through products that break in 3 uses, trying to find something not buried under fake reviews saying the opposite.

Amazon and Temu are slowly wearing down your patience and your faith in humanity. Why does the world now seem to value cheap garbage over appropriately priced quality? You start to genuinely believe that most people can‚Äôt see the steady decline of manufacturing and engineering.

To top it all off, your faithful, 20-year-old, Rancilio Silvia V2 is starting to show its age. So, you post on Reddit expecting to replace it - because that‚Äôs the world you've been conditioned to expect. But what do you know? *Instead*, a community rallies around you, encourages you to replace some parts, and even guides you through the process.

What kind of company are these people running? Don‚Äôt they know there‚Äôs more money in the disposable coffee machine?

Rancilio, you have a customer for life. When I have the money, I'll be upgrading to upgrading to the Silvia Pro X for that sweet double boiler - though that might have to wait until after kids, lol. And you know what? I reckon I‚Äôll donate my beloved, Silvia V2 just to make sure you get one more loyal customer.

1. Only two core consumer products that serve distinct purposes. Both excellent on their own merit. No pushing, no selling the ‚Äúnext best thing.‚Äù 
2. Built with smart engineering and fail-safes for longevity (great for dummies like me who forget to turn them off). 
3. All parts replaceable at home - if you know what you‚Äôre doing. Buy it for life. Hell yeah. 
4. All upgrades are meaningful and backward compatible. No unnecessary waste - because let‚Äôs face it, there‚Äôs already more than enough.

More companies should take this approach. I‚Äôm just sick of the bare-minimum product life cycle strategy from companies like Breville.

And that's all I have to say. about. that.",11,1753248476.0,ranciliosilvia,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The hallmark of an exceptional hazelnut chocolate lies in the quality of its ingredients and the meticulous craftsmanship involved in its creation.

**High-Quality Cocoa Beans:** At the heart of every great chocolate lies the cocoa bean. The finest hazelnut chocolates utilize premium cocoa beans sourced from reputable plantations around the world. Factors such as bean origin, fermentation process, and roasting profile profoundly impact the final product's flavor complexity. Utilizing specific blends of criollo,forastero and trinitario beans allow chocolatiers to create unique and sought-after flavors.

**Perfect Hazelnut Roasting:** The roasting process dramatically affects the flavor profile of the hazelnuts. Precisely roasted nuts will showcase their inherent sweetness and nutty aroma,while under-roasted nuts may taste bland and grassy,and over-roasted nuts may be bitter and burnt. Controlled hot air roasters are frequently employed to avoid scorching and ensure consistent, even results.

**Smooth Chocolate Texture:** The texture of the chocolate is as important as its taste. A smooth,velvety texture that melts effortlessly in your mouth indicates a well-tempered chocolate.This smooth mouthfeel comes from the conching stage in chocolate making. Chocolates with a fine, nearly imperceptible grain are considered luxurious and high-quality.

**Optimal Hazelnut-to-Chocolate ratio:** The balance between the chocolate and the hazelnuts is a crucial element in hazelnut chocolate formulation. The best chocolates strike a chord of harmony, where the taste of the chocolate complements the hazelnut, rather than overpowering it or being overshadowed by it. Most gourmet hazelnut chocolates will have between 20-40% hazelnuts by weight.

**Ingredient Purity:** High-end chocolatiers prioritize ingredient purity. The absence of artificial flavors, preservatives, and excessive sugar is an indicator of quality. The focus is on showcasing the inherent flavors of the cocoa beans and hazelnuts, resulting in a naturally delicious and satisfying taste. Only natural vanilla extract is typically used -- not vanillin.

**Artisan Craftsmanship:** The ""bean-to-bar"" movement emphasizes the artisanal process of chocolate making, allowing chocolatiers to have complete control over every stage, from bean selection to final product packaging. This hands-on approach ensures attention to detail and allows for the creation of unique and innovative flavor combinations.

Key features of the best Hazelnut Chocolates of 2025 include:

* Superior quality cocoa beans
* Perfectly roasted hazelnut flavor
* Exquisite, melty mouthfeel
* Balanced hazelnut-to-chocolate ratio
* Absence of artificial additions
* Artisanal quality.

While I was initially grateful for the chance to get my foot in the door, it‚Äôs become increasingly clear that there‚Äôs no path for growth in my current role.

Despite putting in 50‚Äì60 hour weeks at $20/hr with a long commute, I‚Äôve been relegated mostly to errands, facilities, and lunch service‚Äîwith no real exposure to editorial or pipeline work.

I suspect I have issues with my thyroid, perhaps Reverse T3, as my TSH levels are showing up clinically fine - I‚Äôve just had a full thyroid panel to see whether my thyroid is functional though.

Since the Vitex, I‚Äôve gained more weight - a total of 7-8kg since coming of birth control (over 15lbs I believe), 3-4kg after Vitex. Is this normal and a transitional period?

I feel like I‚Äôm going mad, it‚Äôs nearly 7 months and all I‚Äôm doing is gaining weight since having the IUD out. I‚Äôm seeing a practitioner and she‚Äôs wanting to keep me on Vitex for the meantime however she‚Äôs unsure why I‚Äôm not losing any weight and gaining weight. I truly am eating better than ever, hence the confusion. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

For women trying to conceive, the path can sometimes feel uncertain, confusing, and overwhelming. In a bustling city like Delhi, where modern lifestyles, stress, and pollution silently influence our health, infertility has become a growing concern. Fortunately, **female infertility treatment in Delhi** has evolved with time, and ancient sciences like Ayurveda offer a ray of hope with their holistic and natural approach.

¬†

In this blog, we‚Äôll take you through the complete guide on [**infertility treatment in Delhi**](https://www.aashaayurveda.com/treatment/infertility-treatment), signs and causes of female infertility, how Ayurveda helps, and who is the best specialist for it.

**What Is Female Infertility?**

¬†

Female infertility refers to a woman‚Äôs inability to conceive after trying for 12 months (under 35) or 6 months (over 35) of regular, unprotected intercourse. According to Ayurveda, infertility‚Äîknown as **Vandhyatva**‚Äîis the result of an imbalance in the three Doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), improper lifestyle habits, or toxin accumulation that blocks the reproductive channels.

You might be facing **female infertility** if:

¬ß¬† Your age is below 35 and you have been trying to conceive since one year but unable to get pregnant.¬†

¬ß¬† Your age is above 35 and you have been trying to conceive since 6 months but unable to get pregnant.

¬ß¬† You have irregular or painful periods.

¬ß¬† You‚Äôve experienced one or more miscarriages.

¬ß¬† You have any hormonal issues like PCOS, fibroids, thyroid or endometriosis. .

Whether it‚Äôs due to lifestyle, hormonal changes, or anatomical challenges, **female infertility treatment in Delhi** is available and highly successful‚Äîespecially when treated naturally with Ayurveda.

¬†

**Primary vs. Secondary Infertility**

¬ß¬† **Primary infertility**: When a woman has never been pregnant and struggles to conceive.

¬ß¬† **Secondary infertility**: When a woman is unable to get pregnant again after a successful previous pregnancy.

Both forms are equally common and can be successfully treated with the right diagnosis and Ayurvedic intervention.

¬†

**How Common Is Female Infertility?**

¬†

You‚Äôre not alone. As per medical reports, approximately 10%‚Äì15% of women in India face some form of infertility. This number is steadily increasing due to late marriages, delayed childbearing, poor lifestyle habits, stress, and environmental factors. And in cities like Delhi, where the pace of life is fast and demanding, the number is even higher.

¬†

**Major Signs of Female Infertility**

¬†

Identifying infertility early can significantly improve treatment success. Watch out for:

¬ß¬† Inability to conceive

¬ß¬† Irregular menstrual cycles

¬ß¬† Pain during intercourse

¬ß¬† Heavy or scanty bleeding during periods

¬ß¬† Pelvic or lower abdominal pain

¬ß¬† Recurrent miscarriages

If you experience any of these, it‚Äôs time to explore [**female infertility treatment in Delhi**](https://www.aashaayurveda.com/treatment/infertility-treatment) under the guidance of experienced specialists.

¬†

**Causes of Female Infertility**

¬†

Infertility in women can arise due to multiple factors, some known and others unexplained. Here are the most common causes:

¬†

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ovulation Disorders**

Hormonal imbalances can disrupt the process of ovulation. Conditions like PCOS, thyroid issues, stress, and pituitary gland dysfunction can prevent the release of a mature egg.

¬†

**2. Fallopian Tube Blockage**

Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes‚Äîoften due to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infections like chlamydia or gonorrhea, or endometriosis‚Äîcan prevent fertilization.

¬†

**3. Uterine Issues**

Fibroids, polyps, scar tissues, or an abnormally shaped uterus can hinder the implantation of a fertilized egg.

¬†

**4. Egg Quantity and Quality**

There are a fixed number of eggs in a female body. With age, both quantity and quality decline, making conception harder‚Äîespecially after 35.

¬†

**5. Lifestyle Factors**

There are certain lifestyle factors that contribute to infertility like drinking alcohol, smoking, poor dietary habits, excessive intake of tea or coffee, stress and laziness (no exercise).

¬†

Thankfully, **infertility treatment in Delhi** through Ayurveda addresses these root causes naturally and effectively.

¬†

**The Role of Age in Infertility**

¬†

Fertility naturally declines with age. After 35, the number of healthy eggs decreases rapidly, and risks of miscarriage or chromosomal abnormalities increase. That‚Äôs why early diagnosis and personalized **female infertility treatment in Delhi** is crucial.

¬†

**Prevention Tips for Female Infertility**

¬†

Here are some simple, powerful lifestyle changes you can implement today:

¬ß¬† Maintain a healthy weight through balanced nutrition and regular exercise

¬ß¬† Avoid tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drugs

¬ß¬† Get 7‚Äì8 hours of restful sleep daily

¬ß¬† Manage stress with yoga, meditation, and mindfulness

¬ß¬† Limit exposure to environmental toxins and endocrine disruptors

¬ß¬† You should keep a record of your ovulation cycle with the help of an ovulation kit or apps.

# History Of Coffee Percolators

Have you ever wondered how coffee percolators became a staple in kitchens worldwide? Let‚Äôs take a journey through the intriguing history of coffee percolators. This brewing device has evolved over time, impacting how we enjoy our daily cup of coffee.

# Early Innovations In Coffee Brewing

In the early 19th century, coffee enthusiasts were already experimenting with various brewing methods. The first known percolator was patented by American inventor James Nason in 1865. This initial design set the stage for future innovations by introducing the concept of cycling water through coffee grounds.

# The Rise Of The Percolator

Alfonso Bialetti, a name many coffee lovers recognize, contributed significantly to the popularity of percolators. His iconic Moka pot, invented in 1933, brought percolator-style brewing to households across Italy. While different from traditional percolators, it showcased the potential of stovetop coffee makers.

# Percolators In The Mid-20th Century

By the mid-20th century, percolators were a common sight in American kitchens. Their popularity soared due to the convenience they offered. Electric models emerged, making it easier than ever to brew coffee without constant supervision. This period marked a turning point, as coffee became more accessible to the average consumer.

# Modern Day Usage

Today, percolators are appreciated for their nostalgic value and robust flavor. While they may not be as widespread as drip coffee makers, they hold a special place in the hearts of coffee purists. Some claim that the percolator‚Äôs unique brewing process enhances the coffee‚Äôs aroma and taste. Do you agree?

The history of coffee percolators is a testament to human innovation and our love for coffee. Each stage of its evolution reflects changing lifestyles and technological advancements. So, next time you brew a pot, consider the rich history behind your cup. Have you ever tried using a percolator? What‚Äôs your experience?

# How Coffee Percolators Work

A coffee percolator is a classic brewing tool that cycles hot water through coffee grounds. Water heats up, rises through a tube, and drips over the grounds repeatedly. This process extracts flavors until the coffee reaches the desired strength, creating a robust and aromatic brew.

Understanding how coffee percolators work can enhance your appreciation for this classic brewing method. It‚Äôs an experience that blends simplicity and nostalgia, often reminding us of family gatherings or camping trips. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee aficionado or just someone curious about the process, knowing the mechanics can deepen your connection to your daily brew.

# Mechanism And Process

A coffee percolator operates on a straightforward principle: water is heated, rises through a tube, and drips over coffee grounds. This cycle repeats, extracting flavor with each pass. The process continues until the desired coffee strength is achieved. Picture this: as the water heats, it bubbles up a central tube. It then spreads over the coffee grounds, soaking them thoroughly. The brewed coffee trickles back down to the pot, intensifying with each cycle. There‚Äôs a unique satisfaction in watching this process unfold. The rhythmic bubbling and the aroma fill the air, creating a sensory experience that‚Äôs hard to beat. You control the brewing time, giving you the power to perfect your coffee‚Äôs strength and taste.

# Parts Of A Percolator

To get the most out of your coffee percolator, it helps to know its parts. Understanding these components can make brewing easier and more effective. ‚Äì Coffee Pot: This is the main body where the brewed coffee collects. Typically, it‚Äôs made of stainless steel or glass. ‚Äì Percolation Tube: A central tube that carries hot water to the top. It‚Äôs the heart of the percolation process. ‚Äì Basket: Holds the coffee grounds. It‚Äôs perforated to allow water to flow through and extract flavor. ‚Äì Lid: Seals the pot to maintain heat. Some lids have a clear knob to let you watch the coffee brew. ‚Äì Base: Houses the heating element. It‚Äôs where the magic begins as it heats the water. Each part plays a crucial role in the brewing process. Missing or damaged parts can affect your coffee‚Äôs taste and strength. Have you ever wondered why your coffee tastes different? Checking these components might reveal the answer. Embrace the simplicity and charm of the percolator. Its straightforward design offers a hands-on approach that many modern machines lack. By mastering its mechanics and understanding its parts, you can brew a cup that‚Äôs truly your own.

# Types Of Coffee Percolators

A coffee percolator is a device that brews coffee by cycling boiling water through coffee grounds. There are different types, including stovetop percolators, electric percolators, and camping percolators. Each type offers a distinct brewing experience, catering to different preferences and settings.

When it comes to brewing coffee, the percolator is a classic choice that offers a unique experience. There are different types of coffee percolators that cater to various preferences and lifestyles. Understanding these types can help you decide which one fits best into your daily routine.

# Stovetop Percolators

Stovetop percolators are the traditional choice. They work by cycling boiling water through coffee grounds using gravity. Simple and reliable, they don‚Äôt require electricity‚Äîjust a heat source. Many coffee lovers appreciate the hands-on experience stovetop percolators offer. You control the heat, and with practice, you can fine-tune the brewing process to your taste. Plus, they‚Äôre perfect for camping trips or power outages.

# Electric Percolators

Electric percolators simplify the brewing process. Plug it in, and it takes care of everything, from heating the water to cycling it through the coffee. These are great for those who want convenience without sacrificing the rich flavor of percolated coffee. Electric models often come with features like automatic shut-off and keep-warm functions. This makes them ideal for busy mornings when you don‚Äôt want to worry about turning off the stove. If you value convenience and consistency, an electric percolator might be your new best friend. Have you ever considered how your coffee-making routine reflects your lifestyle? Whether you prefer the control of a stovetop or the ease of an electric percolator, each type offers a unique way to enjoy your coffee. Which one resonates with you?

# Benefits Of Using A Percolator

A coffee percolator brews rich, aromatic coffee by cycling boiling water through coffee grounds. It enhances flavor and aroma, making each cup enjoyable. Easy to use and durable, percolators are a great choice for coffee lovers seeking simplicity and taste.

Using a coffee percolator can transform your coffee experience, offering unique advantages that other brewing methods might miss. Percolators have been a staple in homes and campsites for decades, and there‚Äôs a good reason for their enduring popularity. Let‚Äôs explore why choosing a percolator might just be the best decision for your morning routine.

# Flavor And Aroma

A coffee percolator brings out a rich flavor and bold aroma that can make your mornings truly delightful. The process of cycling boiling water through coffee grounds ensures a robust, full-bodied taste that many coffee enthusiasts swear by. Once, on a camping trip, I discovered that the simple act of brewing coffee with a percolator not only filled the air with an inviting scent but also turned the whole experience into a moment of pure bliss. Have you ever noticed how certain aromas can trigger fond memories?

# Convenience

Percolators are straightforward and easy to use, making them a convenient choice for both beginners and seasoned coffee drinkers. With no complicated settings or buttons, you can enjoy a perfect cup of coffee with minimal effort. Imagine waking up on a chilly morning and simply placing your percolator on the stove or campfire. The anticipation of that first sip is made easier because you know it‚Äôs just a matter of minutes before you enjoy your hot brew. Isn‚Äôt it comforting to have one less thing to worry about in your busy day? Choosing a percolator could be a game-changer for your coffee routine. Why not give it a try and see how it fits into your lifestyle?

# Challenges In Percolator Brewing

A coffee percolator brews coffee by cycling boiling water through coffee grounds. It can be tricky to control the brewing time and temperature. Over-extraction often results in bitter coffee, while under-extraction leads to weak flavors. Balancing these factors is key for a good cup.

Brewing coffee with a percolator can be a delightful ritual for some, yet it comes with unique challenges that can impact your coffee experience. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned coffee enthusiast or a curious beginner, understanding these hurdles can help you brew better coffee. Are you ready to dive into the nuances of percolator brewing?

# Over-extraction Issues

Over-extraction is a common pitfall in percolator brewing. The percolator continuously cycles water through the coffee grounds, which can lead to a bitter taste. Have you ever wondered why your coffee tastes more like dark chocolate than the sweet aroma you expect? The trick is in the grind. Using coarser coffee grounds can reduce the risk of over-extraction. Try experimenting with grind size to find the balance that suits your taste. A simple adjustment can transform the flavor profile of your brew.

# Temperature Control

Temperature plays a crucial role in percolator brewing. If the water gets too hot, it can scald the coffee, leaving you with a burnt taste. Keeping an eye on the heat can be challenging, especially when you‚Äôre multitasking in the morning. Have you ever felt torn between flipping pancakes and ensuring your coffee doesn‚Äôt boil over? A practical tip is to use a thermometer. This tool helps you monitor the temperature, ensuring it stays within the ideal range. Consistent temperature control can make your coffee smoother and more enjoyable. Brewing coffee with a percolator demands attention to detail. By addressing over-extraction and temperature control, you can enhance your coffee experience. What adjustments will you make to perfect your brew?

# Tips For Perfect Percolator Coffee

Perfecting coffee with a percolator involves a few key steps. Each step ensures you get a rich and flavorful brew. Let‚Äôs explore some tips that can elevate your percolator coffee experience. From selecting the right coffee to keeping track of brewing time, these tips are simple yet effective.

# Choosing The Right Coffee

The choice of coffee is crucial for percolator brewing. Opt for coarsely ground coffee beans. Fine grounds can clog the filter basket, impacting flavor. Select beans with a medium to dark roast. These roasts typically provide a robust and aromatic brew. Try different beans to find your preferred taste profile.

# Monitoring Brewing Time

Brewing time affects the strength and taste of your coffee. Start by percolating for around seven to ten minutes. Shorter time results in a milder flavor. Longer brewing can make the coffee taste bitter. Use a timer to maintain consistency in every brew. Adjust time based on your taste preference. Experiment to find your ideal balance.

# Comparing Percolators With Other Methods

A coffee percolator heats water, sending it through coffee grounds repeatedly. This method extracts rich flavors, differing from drip brewers or French presses. Its bubbling sound and strong aroma offer a distinctive brewing experience.

When it comes to brewing coffee, the method you choose can significantly influence the flavor and experience. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned coffee enthusiast or just beginning to explore, understanding how a coffee percolator stacks up against other popular brewing methods can guide you to your perfect cup. By comparing percolators with drip coffee makers and French presses, you can find which method aligns best with your taste and lifestyle.

# Percolator Vs. Drip Coffee

A coffee percolator and a drip coffee maker each offer unique experiences. Percolators cycle the brewing water through the coffee grounds multiple times, potentially resulting in a richer, more robust flavor. However, this can sometimes lead to over-extraction and bitterness if not monitored carefully. Drip coffee makers, on the other hand, are often praised for their convenience and consistency. They pour hot water over the grounds once, delivering a more predictable and mild flavor profile. If you value ease of use and a reliable cup every morning, a drip coffee maker might be more your style. Both methods have their merits, but they cater to different preferences. Which do you prioritize: the depth of flavor or the simplicity of brewing?

# Percolator Vs. French Press

The French press is another favorite among coffee lovers, known for its full-bodied brew. Unlike percolators, French presses steep coffee grounds in hot water, allowing the oils and flavors to fully develop. This results in a rich, aromatic cup with a distinct mouthfeel. Percolators, conversely, offer a bolder taste with a slightly different texture. They work well for those who enjoy a stronger brew but can sometimes leave sediment in your cup, similar to the French press. Both methods require a bit more attention than a drip coffee maker but reward you with a more personalized coffee experience. Do you prefer the immersion of a French press or the cyclical brewing of a percolator? As you consider these options, think about what you want from your coffee ritual. Is it the adventure of experimenting with flavors or the familiarity of a routine that you seek?

# Frequently Asked Questions

# How Does A Coffee Percolator Work?

A coffee percolator brews coffee by cycling boiling water through coffee grounds. The water moves through a tube, drips over the grounds, and seeps back into the water chamber. This process is repeated until the desired coffee strength is achieved.

The result is a rich, robust flavor.

# What Are The Benefits Of Using A Percolator?

Using a percolator enhances flavor by extracting more oils and essences from the coffee. It offers a full-bodied taste and can brew large quantities. Percolators are also durable and portable, making them ideal for camping or travel. They are versatile and work on various heat sources.

# Is Percolated Coffee Stronger Than Drip Coffee?

Percolated coffee is typically stronger than drip coffee. The percolation process recycles water through the grounds multiple times. This results in a bolder and more intense flavor. Drip coffee, on the other hand, passes water through the grounds once, producing a milder taste.

# How Do You Clean A Coffee Percolator?

To clean a coffee percolator, disassemble all removable parts. Rinse them with warm, soapy water and scrub gently. For the interior, fill the percolator with water and a vinegar solution. Run a brewing cycle, then rinse thoroughly. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and ensures optimal coffee flavor.

¬† I had my back to the room as I stared out the window. It was a trick I‚Äôd learned from my mother to make me seem more in control. Elora had given me lots of tips the past few months, but the ones about commanding a meeting were the most useful.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPrincess, I think you‚Äôre being na√Øve,‚Äù the Chancellor said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt turn the entire society on its head.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù I turned back, giving him a cool gaze, and he lowered his eyes and balled up his handkerchief in his hand. ‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt ignore the problems any longer.‚Äù  
  
¬† I surveyed the meeting room, doing my best to seem as cold and imposing as Elora always had. I didn‚Äôt plan to be a cruel ruler, but they wouldn‚Äôt listen to weakness. If I wanted to make a change here, I had to be firm.  
  
¬† Since Elora had become incapacitated as of late, I‚Äôd been running the day to day activities of the palace, including a lot of meetings. The board of advisors seemed to take up a lot of my time.  
  
¬† The Chancellor had been voted into his position by the Trylle people, but as soon as his term was up, I planned to campaign against him as hard as I could. He was a conniving coward, and we needed somebody much stronger in his position.  
  
¬† Garrett Strom ‚Äì my mother‚Äôs ‚Äúconfidant‚Äù ‚Äì was here today, but he didn‚Äôt always come. Depending on how Elora was doing that day, he often chose to stay and care for her instead of attending these meetings.  
  
¬† My assistant Joss sat at the back of the room, furiously scribbling down notes as we talked. She was a small human girl that grew up in F√∂rening as a m√§nsklig and worked as Elora‚Äôs secretary. Since I‚Äôd been running the palace, I‚Äôd inherited Joss as my own assistant.  
  
¬† Duncan, my bodyguard, was stationed by the door, where he stood during all the meetings. He followed me everywhere, like a shadow, and though he was clumsy and small, he was smarter than people gave him credit for. I‚Äôd grown to respect and appreciate his presence the last few months, even if he couldn‚Äôt completely take the place of my last guard, Finn Holmes.  
  
¬† Aurora Kroner sat at the head of the table, next to her was Tove, my fianc√©. He was usually the only one on my side, and I was grateful to have him here. I don‚Äôt know how I would manage ruling if I felt completely alone.  
  
¬† Also in attendance were Marksinna Laurent, a woman I didn‚Äôt particularly trust, but she was one of the most influential people in F√∂rening; Markis Bain, who was in charge of changeling placement; Markis Court, the treasurer for the palace; and Thomas Holmes, the head guard in charge of all the security and trackers.  
  
¬† A few other high-ranking officials sat around the table, all of their expressions solemn. The situation for the Trylle was growing increasingly dire, and I was proposing change. They didn‚Äôt want me to change anything ‚Äì they wanted me to support the system they‚Äôd had for centuries, but that system wasn‚Äôt working anymore. Our society was crumbling, and they refused to see the roles they played in it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWith all due respect, Princess,‚Äù Aurora began, her voice so sweet, I could barely hear the venom underneath, ‚Äúwe have bigger issues at hand. The Vittra are only getting stronger, and with the embargo about to end-‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe embargo,‚Äù Marksinna Laurent snorted, cutting her off. ‚ÄúLike that‚Äôs done us any good.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe embargo isn‚Äôt over yet,‚Äù I said, standing up straighter. ‚ÄúOur trackers are out taking care of the problems now, which is why I think it‚Äôs so important that we have something in place for them when they return.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe can worry about that when they return,‚Äù the Chancellor said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs deal with saving our asses right now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking to redistribute the wealth or call for abolishing the monarchy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI am simply saying that the trackers are out there risking their lives to save us, to protect our changelings, and they deserve a real house to come back to. We should be setting aside money now so that when this is over, we can begin building them real homes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs noble as that is, Princess, we should be saving the money for the Vittra,‚Äù Markis Bain said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt pay the Vittra off,‚Äù Tove interjected. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about money. This is about power. We all know what they want, and a few thousand ‚Äì or even a few million ‚Äì dollars won‚Äôt matter to them. The Vittra King will refuse it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI will do everything in my power to keep F√∂rening safe, but you are all right,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe have yet to find a reasonable solution for the Vittra. That means this might very well turn into a bloody fight, and if it does, we need to support our troops. They deserve the best care, including adequate housing and access to our healers if they‚Äôre injured in wartime.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHealers on a tracker?‚Äù Marksinna Laurent laughed, and a few others chuckled along with her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy is that ridiculous?‚Äù I asked, working to keep the ice from my voice. ‚ÄúThey are expected to die for us, but we aren‚Äôt willing to heal their wounds? We cannot ask more of them than we are willing to give ourselves.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey are lower than us,‚Äù Laurent said, as if I didn‚Äôt understand the concept. ‚ÄúWe are in charge for a reason. Why on Earth should we treat them as equals when they are not?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs basic decency,‚Äù I argued. ‚ÄúWe may not be human, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be devoid of humanity. This is why our people are leaving our cities and preferring to live amongst the humans, letting their powers die. We must offer them some bit of happiness, otherwise why would they stay?‚Äù  
  
¬† Laurent muttered something under her breath, keeping her steely eyes locked on the oak table. Her black hair was slicked back, pulled in a bun so tight her face looked strained. This was probably done on purpose.  
  
¬† Marksinna Laurent was a very powerful Trylle, able to produce and control fire, and something that strong was draining. Trylle powers weakened them, taking some of their life and aging them preternaturally.  
  
¬† But if the Trylle didn‚Äôt use them, the abilities did something to their minds, eating at their thoughts and making them crazy. This was especially true for Tove, who would appear scattered and rude if he didn‚Äôt use his psychokinesis.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is time for a change,‚Äù Tove said, speaking up when the room had fallen into an annoyed silence. ‚ÄúIt can be gradual, but it‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù  
  
¬† A knock at the door stop  
ped anyone from giving him a rebuttal, but from the beet-red color of the Chancellor‚Äôs face, it looked like he had a few words he wanted to get out.  
  
¬† Duncan opened the door, and Willa poked her head in, smiling uncertainly. Since she was a Marksinna, Garrett‚Äôs daughter, and my best friend, she had every right to be here. I‚Äôd extended an invitation for her to attend these meetings, but she always declined, saying she was afraid she would do more harm than good. She had a much harder time being polite when she disagreed with people.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Willa said, and Duncan stepped aside so she could come in. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs after five, and I was supposed to get the Princess at three for her birthday celebration.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glanced at the clock, realizing this had worn on much longer than I‚Äôd originally planned. Willa walked over to me and gave the room an apologetic smile, but I knew she‚Äôd drag me out kicking and screaming if I didn‚Äôt put an end to the meeting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù the Chancellor smiled at me with a disturbing hunger in his eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd forgotten that you‚Äôll be eighteen tomorrow.‚Äù He licked his lips, and Tove stood up, purposely blocking the Chancellor‚Äôs view of me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry, everyone,‚Äù Tove said, ‚Äúbut the Princess and I have plans this evening. We‚Äôll pick this meeting up next week then?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going back to work next week?‚Äù Laurent looked appalled. ‚ÄúSo soon after your wedding? Aren‚Äôt you and the Princess taking a honeymoon?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWith the state of things, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI have too much to get done here.‚Äù  
  
¬† While that was true enough, that wasn‚Äôt the only reason I‚Äôd skipped out on a honeymoon. As much as I‚Äôd grown to like Tove, I couldn‚Äôt imagine what the two of us would do on one. I hadn‚Äôt even let myself think about how we would spend our wedding night.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need to go over the changeling contracts,‚Äù Markis Bain said, standing up in a hurry. ‚ÄúSince the trackers are bringing the changelings back early, and some families decline to do changelings anymore, the placements have all been moved around. I need you to sign off on them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnough talk of business.‚Äù Willa looped her arm through mine, preparing to lead me out from the room. ‚ÄúThe Princess will be back to work on Monday, and she can sign anything you want then.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWilla, it will only take a second to sign them,‚Äù I said, but she glared at me, so I gave Bain a polite smile. ‚ÄúI will look them over first thing Monday morning.‚Äù  
  
¬† Tove walked with us into the hall, and even though we were out of the meeting, Willa still kept her arm through mine as we walked. Duncan stayed a step behind us when we were in the South Wing. I‚Äôd gotten talked to many, many times about how I couldn‚Äôt treat Duncan as an equal while business was being conducted, and there were Trylle officials at work around us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPrincess?‚Äù Joss said, scampering behind me with papers spilling out of her binder. ‚ÄúPrincess, do you want me to arrange a meeting on Monday with Markis Bain for the contracts?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, that would be fantastic,‚Äù I said, slowing so I could talk to her. ‚ÄúThank you, Joss.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have a meeting at ten a.m. with the Markis of Oslinna.‚Äù Joss flipped through the appointment section of the binder, and a paper flew out. Duncan snatched it before it fell to the ground and handed it to her. ‚ÄúThank you. Sorry. So, Princess, do you want to meet Markis Bain before or after that meeting?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll just be going back to work from getting married,‚Äù Willa said. ‚ÄúOf course, she won‚Äôt want to come in first thing in the morning. Make it for the afternoon.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glanced over at Tove walking next to me, but his expression was blank. Since proposing to me, he‚Äôd actually spoken very little of getting married. His mother and Willa had done most of the planning, so I hadn‚Äôt even talked to him about what he thought of colors or flower arrangements. Everything had been decided for us, so we had little to discuss.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDoes two in the afternoon work for you?‚Äù Joss asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, that would be perfect,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThanks, Joss.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù Joss stopped to hurriedly scribble down the time in the binder.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow she‚Äôs off until Monday,‚Äù Willa told Joss over her shoulder. ‚ÄúThat means five whole days where nobody calls her, talks to her, or meets with her. Remember that, Joss. If anybody asks for the Princess, she cannot be reached.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, of course, Marksinna Strom,‚Äù Joss smiled. ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Princess, and good luck with your wedding!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe how much of a workaholic you are,‚Äù Willa sighed as we walked away. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre Queen, I‚Äôll never see you at all.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI tried to get out of the meeting sooner, but things have been getting out of hand lately.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat Laurent is driving me batty,‚Äù Tove said, grimacing at the thought of her. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre Queen, you should banish her.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm Queen, you‚Äôll be King,‚Äù I pointed out. ‚ÄúYou can banish her yourself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, wait until you see what we have planned for you tonight,‚Äù Duncan grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be having too much fun to worry about Laurent or anybody else.‚Äù  
  
¬† Fortunately, since I was getting married in a few days, I‚Äôd gotten out of the usual ball that would happen for a Princess‚Äôs birthday. Elora had an agreement with Aurora that the wedding take place immediately after I turn eighteen. My birthday was on a Wednesday, and I was getting married on Saturday, leaving no time for a massive Trylle birthday party.  
  
¬† Willa insisted on throwing me a small party anyway, even though I didn‚Äôt really want one. Considering everything that was happening in F√∂rening, it felt like sacrilege. The Vittra had set up a peace treaty with us, saying they wouldn‚Äôt attack us until I became Queen. What we hadn‚Äôt realized at the time was the specific language they had used. They wouldn‚Äôt attack us, meaning the Trylle living in F√∂rening. Everyone else was fair game.  
  
¬† The Vittra had started going after our changelings, the ones that were still left with their host families in human society. They‚Äôd taken a few before we caught on, but as soon as we did, we sent all our best trackers in the field to bring home any changeling over the age of sixteen. Any younger than that, our trackers were supposed to stand guard and watch them. They couldn‚Äôt take them without setting off an Amber Alert, so the Vittra avoided taking them too.  
  
¬† That left us at a horrible disadvantage. To protect the changelings, our trackers had to be in the field, so they couldn‚Äôt be here guarding the palace. We would be more exposed to an attack if the Vittra went back on our deal, but I didn‚Äôt see what choice we had. We couldn‚Äôt let them kidnap and hurt children, so I sent every tracker I could out into the field.  
  
¬† Finn had been gone almost continuously for months. He was the best tracker we had, and he‚Äôd been returning the changelings to all the Trylle communities. I hadn‚Äôt seen him since before Christmas, and although I still missed him, it was probably better this way.  
  
¬† I was marrying someone else, and even though I loved Finn, I had to put that behind me and move past it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere is this party happening anyway?‚Äù I asked Willa, pushing thoughts of Finn from my mind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUpstairs,‚Äù Willa said, leading me toward the grand staircase in the front hall. ‚ÄúMatt‚Äôs up there putting on the finishing touches.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFinishing touches?‚Äù I raised an eyebrow.  
  
¬† Someone pounded on the front door, making the door shake. They knocked so hard that the chandelier above us began to tremble. Normally people rang a doorbell, but they were nearly beating down the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStay back, Princess,‚Äù Duncan said as he walked over to the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDuncan, I can get it,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† If somebody hit the door hard enough to make the front hall quake, I was afraid of what they would do to him. I made a move for the door, but Willa stopped me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy, let him,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúYou and Tove will be here if he needs you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I pulled myself from her grip and went after Duncan, to defen  
d him if I needed to.  
  
¬† That sounded silly since he was supposed to be my bodyguard, but I was more powerful than him. He was really only meant to serve as a human shield if need be, but I would never let him do that.  
  
¬† When he opened the door, I was right behind him. Duncan meant to only partially open the door so he could see what waited for us outside, but a gust of wind came up, blowing it open, and sending snow swirling around the front hall.  
  
¬† A blast of cold air struck me, but it died down almost instantly. Willa could control the wind when she wanted to, so as soon as it blew inside the palace, she raised her hand to silence it.  
  
¬† A figure stood in the doorway, bracing himself with his hands on either side of the door. He was slumped forward, his head hanging down, and snow covered his black sweater. His clothes were ragged, worn, and shredded in most places.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan we help you?‚Äù Duncan asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need the Princess,‚Äù he said, and as soon as I heard his voice, a shiver shot through me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLoki?‚Äù I gasped.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPrincess?‚Äù Loki lifted his head. He smiled crookedly, but it didn‚Äôt have his usual bravado. His caramel eyes were tired and pained, and he had a fading bruise on his cheek.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI apologize for the intrusion, Princess,‚Äù he said, his smile already fading. ‚ÄúAnd as much as I‚Äôd like to say that I‚Äôm here for pleasure, I‚Ä¶‚Äù He swallowed something back, and his hands gripped tighter onto the doorframe.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù I asked, pushing past Duncan.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Loki started to speak, but his knees gave out. He pitched forward, and I rushed to catch him. He fell into my arms, and I lowered him to the ground.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLoki?‚Äù I brushed the hair back from his eyes, and they fluttered open.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPrincess.‚Äù He smiled up at me, but it was weak. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd known that this is what it would take to get you to hold me, I would‚Äôve collapsed a long time ago.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is going on, Loki?‚Äù I asked gently. If he hadn‚Äôt been so obviously distressed, I would‚Äôve swatted him for that comment, but he grimaced in pain when I touched his face.  
Amnesty,‚Äù he said thickly, and his eyes closed. ‚ÄúI need amnesty, Princess.‚Äù His head tilted to the side, and his body relaxed. He‚Äôd passed out.

¬† Tove and Duncan had carried Loki up to the servants‚Äô quarters on the second floor. Willa went back to help Matt so he wouldn‚Äôt worry, and I sent Duncan to get Thomas because I had no idea what we should do with Loki. He was unconscious, so I couldn‚Äôt ask him what happened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you going to give him amnesty?‚Äù Tove asked. He stood next to me with his arms folded over his chest, staring down at Loki.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúIt depends on what he says.‚Äù I glanced over at Tove. ‚ÄúWhy? Do you think I should?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúBut I will support any decision you make.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, but I hadn‚Äôt expected any different from him. ‚ÄúCan you see if there‚Äôs a doctor that will look at him?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want me to get my mother?‚Äù Tove asked. His mother was a healer, meaning she could put her hands on someone and heal almost any wound they might have.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. She would never heal a Vittra. Besides, I don‚Äôt want anyone to know that Loki is here. Not yet,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI need an actual doctor. There is a m√§nks doctor in town, isn‚Äôt there?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get him.‚Äù He turned to leave but paused at the door. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be okay with him?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù I smiled.  
  
¬† Tove nodded, then left me alone with Loki. I took a deep breath and tried to figure out what to do. Loki lay on his back, his light hair cascading across his forehead. Somehow he was even more attractive asleep than he was awake.  
  
¬† He hadn‚Äôt stirred at all when they‚Äôd carried him up, and Duncan had jostled and nearly dropped him many times. Loki had always dressed well, and while his clothes looked like they had once been nice, they were little more than rags now.  
  
¬† I sat down on the edge of the bed next to him and touched a hole in his shirt. The skin underneath was discolored and swollen. Tentatively, I lifted his shirt, and when Loki didn‚Äôt stir, I pushed it up more.  
  
¬† I felt strange and almost perverse undressing him, but I wanted to check and make sure there weren‚Äôt obvious contusions. If he were seriously injured, like with broken ribs poking out of his skin, I would summon Aurora and make her heal him, whether she wanted to or not. I wouldn‚Äôt let Loki die because she was prejudiced.  
  
¬† After I pulled his shirt over his head, I got my first good look at him, and my breath caught in my throat. Under ordinary circumstances, I‚Äôm sure his physique would be stunning, but that‚Äôs not what shocked me. His torso was covered with bruises, and his sides had long, thin scars on them.  
  
¬† They wrapped around, so I lifted him a bit, and his back was covered with them. They crisscrossed all over his skin, some of them older, but most of them appeared red and fresh.  
  
¬† Tears stung my eyes, and I put my hand to my mouth. I‚Äôd never seen Loki shirtless before, but he even had scars on his forearms, and they weren‚Äôt there before. This had all happened since I saw him last.  
  
¬† Worse still, Loki had Vittra blood. Physically, he was incredibly strong, which is how he‚Äôd pounded at the door so hard it shook the front hall. That also meant he healed better than most. For him to look this terrible, somebody really had to beat the hell out of him, over and over again, so he wouldn‚Äôt have time to heal.  
  
¬† A jagged scar stretched across his chest, as if someone had tried to stab him, and it reminded me of my own scar that ran along my stomach. My host mother had tried to kill me when I was a child, but that felt like a lifetime ago.  
  
¬† I touched Loki‚Äôs chest, running my fingers over the bumps of his scar. I don‚Äôt know why exactly, but I felt compelled to, as if the scar made us kindred spirits.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou just couldn‚Äôt wait to get me naked, could you, Princess?‚Äù Loki asked tiredly. I started to pull my hand back, but he put his own hand over it, keeping it in place.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I ‚Äì I was checking for wounds,‚Äù I stumbled and wouldn‚Äôt meet his gaze.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù He moved his thumb, almost caressing my hand, until it hit my ring. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù He tried to sit up to see it, so I lifted my hand, showing him the emerald encrusted oval on my finger. ‚ÄúIs that a wedding ring?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, engagement.‚Äù I lowered my hand, resting it on the bed next to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not married yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not too late, then,‚Äù he smiled and settled back in the bed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúToo late for what?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTo stop you, of course.‚Äù Still smiling, he closed his eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that why you‚Äôre here?‚Äù I asked, failing to point out how near we were to my nuptials.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI told you why I‚Äôm here,‚Äù Loki said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat happened to you, Loki?‚Äù I asked, my voice growing thick when I thought about what he had to have gone through to get all those marks and bruises.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you crying, Princess?‚Äù Loki asked and opened his eyes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not crying.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt, but my eyes were moist.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry.‚Äù He tried to sit up, but he winced when he lifted his head, so I put my hand gently on his chest to keep him down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou need to rest,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI will be fine.‚Äù He put his hand over mine again, and I let him. ‚ÄúEventually.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan you tell me what happened?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy do you need amnesty?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRemember when we were in the garden?‚Äù Loki asked.  
  
¬† Of course I remembered. Loki had snuck in over the wall and asked me to run away with him. I had declined, but he‚Äôd stolen a kiss before he left, a rather nice kiss. My cheeks reddened slightly at the memory, and that made Loki smile wider.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI see you do,‚Äù he grinned.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with anything?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Loki said, referring to the kiss. ‚ÄúI meant when I told you that the King hates me. He really does, Princess.‚Äù His eyes went dark for a minute.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe Vittra King did this to you?‚Äù I asked, and my stomach tightened. ‚ÄúYou mean Oren? My father?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it now,‚Äù he said, trying to calm the anger inside me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy does the King hate you? Why did he do this to you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPrincess, please.‚Äù He closed his eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhausted. I barely made it here. Can we have this conversation when I‚Äôm feeling a bit better? Say, in a month or two?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLoki,‚Äù I sighed, but he had a point. ‚ÄúRest. But we will talk tomorrow. Alright?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs you wish, Princess,‚Äù he conceded, and he was already drifting back to sleep again.  
  
¬† I sat beside him for a few minutes longer, my hand still on his chest so I could feel his heartbeat pounding underneath. When I was certain he was asleep, I slid my hand out from under his, and I stood up.  
  
¬† In the hall, I wrapped my arms around myself. I couldn‚Äôt shake the heavy guilt I felt, as if I somehow shared responsibility for what happened to Loki. I‚Äôd only spoken to Oren once, and I had no control over what he did. So why did I feel like it was my fault that Loki had been so brutally beaten?  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt in the hall for long when Duncan and Thomas approached. I‚Äôd wanted to alert as few people as possible about Loki‚Äôs presence, but I trusted Thomas. Not just because he was the head guard or Finn‚Äôs father. He‚Äôd once had an illicit affair with Elora, so I thought he was good at keeping secrets.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe Vittra Markis is in there?‚Äù Thomas asked, but he was already looking past me into the room where Loki slept.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, but he‚Äôs been through hell,‚Äù I said, rubbing my arms as if I had a chill. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to be out for a while.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDuncan said he asked for amnesty.‚Äù Thomas looked down at me. ‚ÄúAre you going to give it to him?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure yet,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt been able to talk much. But I‚Äôm letting him stay here for now, at least until he heals and we can have a conversation.‚Äù  
  
&nb  
sp; ‚ÄúHow do you want us to handle this?‚Äù Thomas asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tell Elora. Not right now,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† The last time Loki had been here, he‚Äôd been held captive. We don‚Äôt have a real prison, so Elora had used her telekinesis to hold him in place, but that had weakened her so much it nearly killed her. In fact, she hadn‚Äôt recovered from it yet, and there would be no way she could do it again.  
  
¬† Besides that, I didn‚Äôt think Loki was really capable of causing trouble. Not in this state, at least. And he‚Äôd come to us of his own free will. We didn‚Äôt need to hold him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe need a guard stationed outside his door at all times, just to be safe,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a threat, but I won‚Äôt take any chances with the Vittra.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can stand watch now, but somebody will have to relieve me of my post eventually,‚Äù Thomas said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can take over later,‚Äù Duncan offered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Thomas shook his head. ‚ÄúYou stay with the Princess.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you have any other guards you can trust?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† Most of the guards seemed to be gossips, and when one of them heard something, they all knew it. But there were very few guards around to tell anymore, since most of them were out protecting changelings.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know of one or two,‚Äù Thomas nodded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMake sure they know they cannot tell anybody about this. This all needs to stay quiet until I figure out what I‚Äôm going to do. Is that clear?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, Your Highness,‚Äù Thomas said. It always felt strange hearing people refer to me as Highness.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I told him.  
  
¬† Tove arrived shortly after that with the m√§nks doctor. I waited outside the room while he examined Loki. He woke up for it, but offered very little explanation for his injuries. When he was done, the doctor concluded that Loki didn‚Äôt have any serious ailments, and he gave him medication for pain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Tove said, after the doctor had gone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting now. There‚Äôs nothing more you can do. Why don‚Äôt you go enjoy your party?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know if there‚Äôs any change with him,‚Äù Thomas promised.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I nodded, and walked down the hall with Tove and Duncan toward my room.  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt felt like having a party before Loki crashed the palace, and I felt even less like having one now. But I had to at least try to have fun so I didn‚Äôt hurt Willa or Matt‚Äôs feelings. I know they had gone to a lot of trouble for it, so I would play the part of the happy birthday girl for them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe doctor thinks he‚Äôll be okay,‚Äù Duncan said, responding to my solemn expression.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you so worried about him anyway?‚Äù Duncan asked. ‚ÄúI know that you two are friends or something, but I don‚Äôt understand. He‚Äôs a Vittra, and he kidnapped you once.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried,‚Äù I cut him off and forced a smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited for the party.‚Äù  
  
¬† Duncan directed me to the upstairs living room. It had been Rhys‚Äôs playroom when he was little, but they‚Äôd converted it into a place to hang out when he became a teenager. But the ceilings had murals of clouds and childish things, and the walls were lined with short white shelves that still held a few of his old toys.  
  
¬† When I opened the door, I was bombarded by streamers and balloons. A banner with the words ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù in giant glitter letters hung on the back wall.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHappy birthday!‚Äù Willa shouted before I could step inside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHappy birthday!‚Äù Rhys and Rhiannon said in unison.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, guys,‚Äù I said, pushing a helium-filled balloon out of my face so I could go in. ‚ÄúYou guys know my birthday isn‚Äôt actually until tomorrow?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course I know,‚Äù Matt said, his voice a little high from inhaling helium. He had a deflated balloon in his hands, the source of the helium, and he tossed it aside to walk over to me. ‚ÄúI was there when you were born, remember?‚Äù  
  
¬† He‚Äôd been smiling, but it faltered when he realized what he‚Äôd said. Rhys and I had been switched at birth. Matt had actually been there for Rhys‚Äôs birth, not mine.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I was there when you came home from the hospital anyway,‚Äù Matt said and hugged me. ‚ÄúHappy birthday.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, hugging him back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd I definitely know your birthday,‚Äù Rhys said, walking over to us. ‚ÄúHappy birthday!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHappy birthday to you too,‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúHow does it feel to be eighteen?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPretty much exactly the same as it does being seventeen,‚Äù Rhys laughed. ‚ÄúDo you feel any older?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, not really,‚Äù I admitted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, come on,‚Äù Matt said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve matured so much in the past six months. I hardly even recognize you anymore.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still me, Matt,‚Äù I said, shifting uneasily from his compliment.  
  
¬† I knew that I‚Äôd grown up some. Even physically, I‚Äôd changed. I wore my hair down more now because I finally managed to tame my curls after a lifetime of struggling with them. Since I was running a kingdom now, I had to play the part and wear dark-colored gowns all the time. I had to look like a Princess.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing, Wendy,‚Äù Matt smiled at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù I waved my hand. ‚ÄúNo more seriousness. This is supposed to be a party.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúParty!‚Äù Rhys shouted and blew on one of those cardboard horns they used on New Year‚Äôs.  
  
¬† Once the party got underway, I actually did have fun. This was much better than if I‚Äôd had a ball, since most of the people here wouldn‚Äôt be able to go. Matt wasn‚Äôt even supposed to live in the palace, and since Rhys and Rhiannon were m√§nks, they would never be allowed to attend a ball. Duncan would be let in, but he‚Äôd have to work. He wouldn‚Äôt be able to laugh and goof around like he did here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy, why don‚Äôt you help me cut the cake?‚Äù Willa suggested while Tove attempted to act out some kind of clue for charades. Duncan had guessed everything under the sun, but he wasn‚Äôt even close.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, sure,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd been sitting on the couch, laughing at everyone‚Äôs failed attempts, but I got up and went over to the table where Willa stood. A cake sat on a brightly colored tablecloth, next to a small pile of gifts. Both Rhys and I had specifically asked for no gifts, but here they were.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Willa said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to drag you away from the fun, but I wanted to talk to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I shrugged it off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour brother made the cake.‚Äù Willa gave me an apologetic smile as she sliced through the white frosting. ‚ÄúHe insisted that it was your favorite.‚Äù  
  
¬† Matt might be a very good cook, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. I dislike most food, especially processed ones, but Matt had been trying hard to feed me for years, so I pretended to like a lot of things I didn‚Äôt like. My birthday cake was one of them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not horrible,‚Äù I said, but it kind of was. At least to me, and Willa and all the other Trylle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wanted to let you know that I didn‚Äôt tell Matt about Loki.‚Äù Willa lowered her voice as she carefully put pieces of cake on small paper plates. ‚ÄúHe would just worry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, and looked back over at Matt, laughing at the ridiculous miming Tove was doing. ‚ÄúI suppose I‚Äôll have to tell him eventually.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think Loki will be around for a while?‚Äù Willa asked. She‚Äôd gotten some frosting on her finger, and she licked it off, then grimaced.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I think he will be,‚Äù I nodded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt worry about it now,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúThis is your last day to be a kid!‚Äù  
  
¬† I tried to push all of my fears and concerns I had about the kingdom, and Loki, from my mind. And eventually, when I let myself, I had a really good time with my friends.  
  
¬† 3. Scars  
  
¬† My dreams were filled with bad winter storms. Snow blowing so hard I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Wind so cold I froze to the bone. But I had to keep going. I had to get through the storms.  
  
¬† Duncan woke me up a little after  
nine the morning. Usually, I got up at six or seven to get ready for the day, depending on what time my first meetings were. Since it was my birthday, I‚Äôd slept in a bit, and it felt nice but strange.  
  
¬† He wouldn‚Äôt have woken me at all, except Elora requested to eat breakfast with me today since it was my birthday. I didn‚Äôt mind being woken up, though. Sleeping in that late made me feel surprisingly lazy.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt even really know what I would do with the day. It‚Äôd been so long since I had a full day that was free of plans. Either I was working on things for the kingdom, helping Aurora with the wedding plans, or spending time with Willa and Matt.  
  
¬† I met Elora in her bedroom for breakfast, which was usually where I saw her. She‚Äôd been in decline for a while, but even before Christmas, she‚Äôd been on bed rest. Aurora had tried healing her a few times, but she was only staving off the inevitable.  
  
¬† On my way to Elora‚Äôs chambers in the South Wing, I walked past the room Loki was staying in. His bedroom door was closed, and Thomas stood guard outside. He nodded once as I walked by, so I assumed everything was still going alright.  
  
¬† Elora‚Äôs bedroom was massive. The double doors into her room were floor to ceiling, so they were nearly two stories high. The room itself could easily fit two of my bedrooms in it, and my room was quite large. Making the room look even larger was a full wall of windows, although she kept the shades drawn most of the time, preferring the dim light of a bedside lamp.  
  
¬† To fill the space, she had several armoires, a writing desk, the largest bed I‚Äôd ever seen, and a sitting area complete with a couch, two chairs, and a coffee table. Today, she‚Äôd had a small dining table with two chairs set up near the window. It was all laid out with fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal ‚Äì my favorite things.  
  
¬† The last few times I‚Äôd visited with her, Elora had been in bed, but she sat at the table today. Her long hair had once been jet black, but it was now silver-white. Her dark eyes were clouded with cataracts, and her porcelain skin had wrinkled. She was still elegant and beautiful, and I imagine she always would be, but she‚Äôd aged so much.  
  
¬† She was pouring herself tea when I came in, her silk dressing gown flowing behind her.

**CHAPTER 1**

Cold, sleepless, and exhausted. Those three words can describe the majority of any sailors‚Äô time out to sea, with the other portion of that time consisting of getting absolutely blitzed within hours of stepping foot on the next port. While I wish I could say I was a part of the groups of mature individuals who spent their free time in foreign lands enjoying the scenery and taking the time to experience different cultures. I was spending what free time I had drinking my day away at some tourist trap bar in another country. And more specifically, trying to figure out why the local girls wanted nothing to do with a drunk American.

We were one month into our deployment, and we had finally hit our first port of hopefully many in the country of Spain. Unfortunately, we were only here for twenty-four hours, so for the few of us that were able to get off the ship this afternoon, we tried to make up for the past thirty days sailing the North Atlantic Ocean by hitting the first bar we found.

The building sat on a busy corner of the main square, and while at first I was annoyed at how loud it was, it quickly became clear why my buddy chose this place. After countless days and nights watching beeping computer screens at watch stations and listening to the constant low hum of the ship‚Äôs engine, the rowdy crowd turned out to be a refreshing change of pace.With the empty beer bottles began filling our tables, it was nice to just disappear into the background.

As is the norm, we weren‚Äôt exactly sure what our actual mission was. Those types of the details were for upper leadership to know, and we were to just do our jobs as best we can.

At least that‚Äôs how my friend Camacho explained it to me.

I had only been in the Navy for about six months by this point. Barely enough time to get through my initial training, to then get sent to the USS O‚ÄôNEILL which was prepping for its final deployment. I was initially disappointed that I was going to have to immediately deploy within just half a year of enlisting, but nearly everyone I talked to said there was no better time than deployment for a new guy to learn the ropes. And they were right.

Within just a few weeks I was quickly learning my job, how the ship worked, and more importantly, what people to talk to if you were in need of something you might not normally be allowed to have. People hawking cigarettes, dip, and other general items were a dime a dozen. But occasionally, on those long nights where you‚Äôve been up nearly days, mentally and physically exhausted, knowing the right guy who *just* might have a little flask of something special to warm the soul was a much-needed creature comfort.

Camacho and I sat in a booth at the back of a bar talking about the past month. Motion-sickness plagued me the first few days but at this point I could confidently say I had gotten my sea legs.

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre just supposed to be okay with not knowing why we‚Äôre even here?‚Äù I asked Camacho, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of lame..‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù, Camacho burped through his thick mustache, ‚ÄúJust how it goes man, nothing to stress over, just gotta keep your head down and do your job. Easy-peasy‚Äù.

He finished off his beer before rambling some more; ‚ÄúI mean you‚Äôll hear things here and there about what‚Äôs going on, but most of it‚Äôs just everyone repeating stuff they heard from someone else‚Äôs, friend‚Äôs, Chief‚Äôs yadda yadda blah blah. By the time it gets to you only about a quarter of it has any merit, if any at all.‚Äù

I sat back while the waitress placed my water in front of me, and another beer in front of Camacho.

‚ÄúWas a matter kid‚Äù, Camacho half slurred when he saw my water, ‚Äúer Angelo, Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúCallin‚Äô it for the night already?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah..‚Äù, I said through a chuckle, appreciative of the fact that Camacho was making the effort to stop calling me kid.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to make a fool of myself on my first port visit‚Äù.

I probably had another few beers before I had to worry about that, but my halfhearted and blubbering effort to court some Spanish girl earlier had made me realize how fast I was spiraling into a drunken stupor. I‚Äôm not sure what she said exactly, as what little Spanish I learned growing up didn‚Äôt translate to the more formal ‚ÄúSpain Spanish‚Äù, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the facial expressions and general tone for ‚Äúget your drunk ass out of my face‚Äù are universal...

Camacho slammed his new beer back in four gulps and let out a sigh. ‚ÄúWell kid, you keep making smart decisions like that and you‚Äôll be giving me orders in a few years, let‚Äôs head back to the ship before you have to carry me, I‚Äôm beat.‚Äù

While I‚Äôm sure it was in jest, I was relieved we were heading back. I didn‚Äôt want to be the spoilsport who asked to go back first, and Camacho was damn near twice my size so I doubted I could carry him if I had to.

As we walked back to the ship, Camacho decided to let me in on the one rumor he had heard before pulling into the country.

‚ÄúBringin‚Äô someone on-board for a bit I heard‚Äù he burped, the wind carrying his toxic breath through his beer covered mustache directly into my nose. ‚ÄúNot sure why or who, just that they‚Äôd be hopping on tonight. Maybe they‚Äôre here to help with the *problems* we‚Äôve been having lately...‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm‚Äù I muttered in response. The short reply partly because most of my concentration was on walking in a straight line, but mainly as I tried to disguise how happy I was that I was starting to be trusted enough to be in his inner circle. Camacho had taken to mentoring me when I checked onto the ship, and we‚Äôd grown to be pretty close for only knowing each other for about two months.

The problems he spoke about though could only mean the other sailor‚Äôs that left the ship over the past few months before I joined the crew. Rumors and exaggerations were always abuzz, but from what I had heard, the USS O‚ÄôNEILL had had two sailors in the past year fall ill and were forced to leave the ship permanently, and one go completely missing. All came with official explanations, but it was hard to justify that many in that short of a time-span.

Maybe we were the testing ground for different types of inoculations. Maybe there was a global pandemic and we were ground zero. Maybe the ship‚Äôs cooks just didn‚Äôt wash their hands. My mind raced through the possibilities as we stumbled onto the ship past the Quarterdeck around nine-pm. And after taking what felt like a five-minute piss, I headed to my rack and passed out.

I woke up in a panic and immediately checked my phone. Usually wake-ups like that meant I had slept in past my alarm and would get a more than unpleasant conversation from my Chief, but after checking the time, I realized it was only around eleven o‚Äôclock that same night.

Heart racing and realizing it would be some time before I could go back to sleep, I slipped back into my coveralls and decided to walk around the outside of the ship for some fresh air.

I made my way through passageways, past the outer doors, sneaked my way to the most forward part of the ship, and was met with the smell of the sea to my left and the sounds of a still lively city to my right.

I looked around to make sure I was alone, lit up a cigarette, and enjoyed the view of the city in the distance.

Attempting to hopefully prep myself to head back to bed soon, I closed my eyes and tried to relax, listening to my surroundings. Mooring lines groaned against the strain as they held the ship to the pier, waves splashed up against the coastline, wind swept across the bow, the smell of the ocean following closely behind.

A few minutes later I was startled by a voice a few feet behind me cutting through the orchestra of sounds I was finally getting accustomed to.

‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs been a while Angelo, but I‚Äôm fairly certain smoking up here isn‚Äôt permitted, correct?‚Äù the voice said curiously.

I tossed the cigarette into the water and whipped around, readying myself for the biggest ass-chewing of my career (so far).

*Shit*.

Well, he called me by name so no use in running. I was mainly surprised whoever this was could recognize me enough in the night. I searched for his voice in my memory but nothing popped up. I scanned every feature to try and figure out who had caught me. His rank, his name tag, anything that I could use to at least appropriately address him, but I came up blank.

It didn‚Äôt help that it was damn near pitch black outside minus a few lights next to the pier, and my eyes had been fixed on the city long enough that my pupils were now having to adjust back to low-light levels.

I decided si*r* was the safest bet for now.

‚ÄúEvening sir, pardon me,‚Äù I said quickly, ‚ÄúI know I shouldn‚Äôt be smoking out here. It won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax.‚Äù The stranger spoke calmly.

I did.

As my eyes became more accustomed to the dark, I started to make out his attire. Civilian clothing. Sharp features. A stranger to our ship the past month out to sea. Not part of the crew...

As though he knew what I was thinking he began speaking again. ‚ÄúBefore you get alarmed, I just boarded this vessel about ten minutes ago as a guest.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh..uh..okay.‚Äù I managed to stammer.

I decided to make a quick exit before I made more of a fool of myself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time for me to head out though, have a good night‚Äù.

He gave me a curt nod, and I made my way to the nearest watch station to ask about the man.

‚ÄúYup, he‚Äôll be with us for a bit, just checked in with us a little while ago‚Äù, the Officer of the Deck told me through tired eyes, ‚ÄúAny other questions,***Seaman*** Angelo?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo sir, have a good night‚Äù I muttered. I was slightly annoyed at how deliberately he called out my rank as a Seaman, one of the lower ranks, but considering they had been standing guard for the past seven hours it was hard to blame him for not being too chatty.

I made my way to my rack and forced myself to sleep in preparation for the long day ahead of me.

**Chapter 2**

*The bulkheads of the ship shrank around me, closing in as I ran through the passageways. OUT, my mind seemed to scream at me as my heart felt like it was about to explode from the force. My chest burned as I struggled to breath against the pressure of cold steel squeezing my lungs. I pushed against the walls, straining for relief while I pushed my way through the ship. Something behind me gave chase and I could hear it scraping on the bulkheads as it got closer. No voice followed, but I could somehow feel it in my mind, calling for me to stay, to succumb.*

*As my skin became raw, scraping off against every obstacle I encountered, the entity walked slowly...deliberately, right behind me. ‚ÄúTo me‚Äù, it whispered as I felt it‚Äôs fingers start to snake their way around my arms. Darkness enveloping my vision, I mustered up every ounce of strength I had and finally broke through to the surface of the ship.*

I woke up that morning groggy and covered in sweat. My heartbeat still raced as I came to realize that horrible scenario had just been a dream.

*Maybe a little less beer next time...*I thought, and made my way topside to help the crew unmoore from the pier and set sail for our next destination. Wherever that was.

I was initially alone in my curiosity about the stranger. As for everyone else it was business as usual, more annoyed that we had one more mouth to feed and one more person to account for. These feelings were left to the wayside quickly however as our new guest, who had introduced himself as Nicolas, was a much more charismatic individual than the person I met the previous night.

I would see him throughout the day inside of the ship chatting up anyone who had time to talk. A taller and somewhat slender individual with a lighter complexion, he had to hunch over while walking through many of the smaller portions of the ship. He moved quickly however and with an air of confidence. So much so that I noticed I had been subconsciously fixing my own posture in a vain attempt at imitation.

I hadn‚Äôt had much time myself to talk to him as I had a lot of work to catch up on, but the first time I passed him he gave me a simple wink and a smile. Hopefully an indicator that he hadn‚Äôt told anyone about our previous encounter. I breathed a sigh of relief as I realized that meant I probably wasn‚Äôt going to get in any trouble, and made a mental note to thank the man later. I had wanted to talk to him sooner, but being bogged down by work had severely taken away what free time I had. Our ship, however, was somewhat small being a Destroyer, so it was hard to *not s*ee damn near everyone at least once a day.

After just a few nights underway it was obvious that Nicolas was a very disciplined individual. His schedule was strict enough that you could pinpoint to the minute when he‚Äôd be somewhere. Every day at six-thirty AM on the dot he‚Äôd be in the chow-line for breakfast, talking up a storm to everyone around him. Ten AM I‚Äôd pass him on my way to my watch station as he made his way up to our ship's Captain, Captain Merriman‚Äôs, quarters. At this point I‚Äôd lose track of him as I got lost in my work, and I never saw him during lunch, but I could always count on him being at dinner at exactly seven PM. Always with his little pouch of personal silverware he had brought with him, pristine and sparkling.

Finally, two weeks into our voyage, my watch schedule shifted to nights, and I was able to get a bit more time to myself. I had also hoped that the shift change would help with the horrendous dreams I‚Äôd been experiencing since we left Spain.

Nearly every other night I‚Äôd been plagued by vivid nightmares. Everything from unseen creatures pulling me into suffocating darkness, to the ship itself dragging me to the depths of the ocean. I decided to push through the fatigue and see how I felt after our next port visit, as I didn‚Äôt think *bad dreams* were a good enough reason to bug our ship‚Äôs medic.

My third night shift, right before I went on watch, I made my way to the forward part of the ship to look at the stars while we sailed through the sea.

You can always look outside, even in big cities and see a few. But nothing compares to stargazing in the middle of the ocean. No lights as far as you can see, and the most beautiful dark skies you can imagine. Immediately upon opening the outer door the stars shone bright and I found myself engrossed in the glorious night.

As I neared my normal spot, I noticed Nicolas standing at the same location I was heading for. He seemed to be taking in the sights above, hampered slightly by the nearly full moon.

I walked up and I couldn‚Äôt help myself as my eyes drifted to the sky. It‚Äôs bright and seemingly endless supply of stars making me feel insignificant.

‚ÄúI wanted to thank you sir, from before. For keeping that incident between us‚Äù, I said as I broke the silence.

He remained motionless, staring upwards as he responded. ‚ÄúIncident?‚Äù he questioned. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre calling it I hope I can count on the same discretion I showed you.‚Äù

As he spoke, he moved his hand slightly showing the lit cigarette he was keeping hidden in his palm.

‚ÄúOld habits‚Äù, Nicolas puffed as he took a drag.

I lit one up myself and we both sat in silence as the ship cut through the waves, a rhythmic sound coating our ears as the ship bobbed through the ocean.

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù I asked, now having mustered up the courage to start a conversation, ‚ÄúCould I ask you why you‚Äôre here? I heard we don‚Äôt normally take on civilians?‚Äù

He looked towards me as he answered, ‚ÄúWell we can mark off discretion as not being one of your strong points, yes?‚Äù

I *knew* I shouldn‚Äôt have asked. I tensed as he continued.

To my surprise he just gave a half smile and turned back to the ocean before speaking again. ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre the first person to ask me that since I‚Äôve boarded? I‚Äôd assume most are either too busy to care, or maybe have a *bit* more sense to not ask in the first place‚Ä¶‚Äù He gave me a friendly bump on my shoulder with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúFortunately,‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúMy services are hardly ever *actually* needed, even when I‚Äôm called out like this on such short notice.*Unfortunately*, that usually means I‚Äôm in for a very dull trip.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose I can‚Äôt complain about the free ride though‚Äù.

‚ÄúMoney can‚Äôt be too bad either?‚Äù I questioned.

He finished the last few puffs of his cigarette, crumpled it up with a few deft movements of his fingers, and tossed it into the ocean as he replied, ‚ÄúThe pay is...acceptable. I‚Äôd consider it more of a civic duty than anything else‚Äù.

We spoke a bit more for some time, however I checked my watch and noticed we had been talking for longer than I realized. I bid my farewell and made my way to my watch station before I was late.

Throughout the next three weeks when I had the time, I met up with Nicolas before my night watch and had conversations about a myriad of subjects. Current events, gossip among the crew. He even gave me pointers on how I should approach this girl I liked in another department on the ship. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much of the required charisma, but progress is progress, and I‚Äôd take any advice I could take at this point to get a decent shot with Katie. She was *way* out of my league, but something about her just seemed to click with me.

‚ÄúAnd what steps have you taken so far?‚Äù Nicolas said as he listened to me ramble at another nightly excursion at the front of the ship, ‚ÄúWhat are her interests? Her family background? Have you at least managed to make her laugh?‚Äù

He chuckled at the last one. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most important one my friend! If you can‚Äôt do that, then she either doesn‚Äôt find you funny, or she doesn‚Äôt find you interesting enough to *fake* a laugh. Both are **equally** as important‚Äù.

I raced through my mind thinking of all my past run in‚Äôs with Katie but I couldn‚Äôt think of a single time we even had enough of a conversation where I could work a joke in.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs busy‚Äù, I managed to respond, realizing I had nothing else going for me, ‚ÄúBut she does look at me a lot I guess?I catch her looking at me pretty often if that‚Äôs worth anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù, Nicolas mused, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs as clueless as you. Perfect for each other by pure, dumb, clueless, luck.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell if it‚Äôs to be, then keep at it‚Äù. He continued, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have cut this chat short. I have a few things I need to take care of before I head to bed myself‚Äù. He patted me on the back as he started his way back inside.

As he left though I could tell he seemed unsteady on his feet. Right as I was about to ask him if he was okay he stumbled and I barely managed to catch him before he hit the ground. My shoulder throbbed with pain as he caught it...no *squeezed it...*with his left hand and steadied himself.

‚ÄúMy apologies‚Äù he said, his voice now sounding strained, ‚ÄúSea-sickness.Never could get used to it‚Äù. He righted himself and quickly made his way to the inside of the ship before I could respond.

I stood there motionless for longer than I could remember before the slam of the outer doors made me snap back. Heading inside seemed the proper option now that I was alone, and I made my way to the men‚Äôs berthing. As I passed the second level like I always did, I felt something pulling me towards the aft, or back part of the ship.

Still not tired, and not having nothing else to do, I made my way aft guided only by whatever odd feeling that was leading me. At this time of night, the hallways were bathed in a dark amber glow as the red lights kicked on. Originally somewhat annoying, I found they had an important purpose. If we were to take any sort of hit that would breach the hull, a regular yellow or white light could be seen for miles.

A red light though that was just dim enough wasn‚Äôt nearly as noticeable, and could could mean the difference between a crew that made it home safely.

I lurched through the ship, searching for whatever called to me in the eerie glow. As I made way through about two levels down, I stopped dead in my tracks and spun around.

A closed door I had passed just a few moments ago was now wide open, it‚Äôs multiple handles that squeezed the door to make it watertight lay in the open position. The dark emptiness of space pulled me inward and I stared into the void, looking for any type of explanation, but nothing appeared. No engineer checking for leaks, no flirty couples exiting after a nightly escapade, just pure darkness.

My vision began to tunnel as nothing else seemed to matter at that point. I wanted, no *I needed* to go inside that space. Euphoria enveloped my mind as I inched closer.*This* ***is*** *right*, I thought, *everything* ***will*** *be better won‚Äôt it‚Ä¶*

I froze about three feet away from the door as my eyes became better adjusted to the low light. Something *was* in that space. I could faintly make out a silhouette of something standing there but something was horribly wrong. Two maroon orbs hovered where a person‚Äôs eyes should be, an unnerving red glow smoldered around it‚Äôs unnatural white pupils.

Sweat ran down my neck as I stood there transfixed on the entity, my mind struggling to make sense of anything.

A loud ringing filled my ears, snapping me out of my stupor as the ship‚Äôs announcement system blared to life with a rapid ringing of bells. I turned my attention to the nearest PA system speaker as the bells ceased and listened to the rest of the message, ‚ÄúMAN OVERBOARD, MAN OVERBOARD‚Äù, the messenger yelled, ‚ÄúALL HANDS MUSTER TO YOUR DESIGNATED ROLL CALL AREA!‚Äù

My eyes darted back to the space but the odd feeling I had was gone. Now in a better state of mind I whipped out my phone‚Äôs flashlight and crept closer to the [door.It](http://door.It) was empty. Completely and utterly empty. I checked under storage shelves, behind AC units, everywhere a person could hide. But nothing.

With no time to give more thought into it, I made my way to my roll call area to make sure I was accounted for.*Maybe these damn nightmares are finally taking their toll,*I thought as I rounded my way to the mess decks. It was a flurry of chaos as names were shouted out to the people marking off their personnel.

‚ÄúCalhoun‚Äôs here!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe sent someone to wake up Davidson, give him a minute!‚Äù

‚ÄúSupply department fully accounted for Chief!‚Äù

I found Camacho towering above everyone searching the crowd worriedly. Relief washed across his face as he saw me and his voice boomed effortlessly over to the people taking muster, ‚ÄúAngelo‚Äôs here! Engineering‚Äôs good to go!‚Äù.

He rushed over to me shoved a finger into my chest.

‚ÄúWhere the hell were you kid?!‚Äù he said quickly, ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt find you in your rack, weren‚Äôt scheduled for watch, had half the division trying to find you‚Äù.

*Well there goes the two better excuses I could have used..*

‚ÄúI was topside‚Äù I lied, ‚ÄúWent to get some fresh air and it took me a minute to make my way here‚Äù.

Camacho eyed me curiously then just let out a sigh.

‚ÄúWell‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see ya. Don‚Äôt have too many details but it looks like this wasn‚Äôt a drill‚Äù.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù he said anxiously, ‚ÄúHopefully this is just some dumb prank‚Ä¶‚Äù But I could tell he was trying to come up with excuses, because the alternative was a gruesome thing to acknowledge.

One of the officer‚Äôs yelled for silence and his voice cut through with the beginnings of a question that would start the unfortunate and unfruitful search that would follow.  
  
‚ÄúHas anyone seen Petty Officer Carter?‚Äù Lieutenant Marshall asked in a serious and somber tone.

The next few hours were a blur.

Even at this late in the night, all hands searched with renewed purpose through every nook and cranny on the ship for signs of Carter, one of our quartermasters.

Sleeping quarters, officer cabins, engineering spaces, ladder wells.Anywhere a mouse could fit we searched.And after we searched everywhere, we did it again. About three hours later, the call was made that she wasn‚Äôt on the ship, and we were sent to our racks.

The next morning we were allotted a lighter work load as the crew recovered from the lack of sleep after an all night manhunt. A somber mood filled the passage ways as everyone waited for the official announcement from the Captain.

‚ÄúHeard she was having some problems at home‚Äù I heard one of the cooks say in passing, ‚Äúmaybe it just got to be too much‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Later that afternoon during dinner, the PA system crackled to life and there was a visible cringe among everyone as we braced for the news.

‚ÄúGood afternoon crew,‚Äù the Captain said, ‚ÄúThis is not news a Captain, nor anyone wants to give. But as of today, although we will continue to search until we are told otherwise, I regret to inform you that Petty Officer Naomi Carter has officially been reported missing.‚Äù

Silence filled the room and one of Carter‚Äôs closer friends got up from her table and left quickly, tears streaming down her cheeks.

The Captain continued, ‚ÄúLast night at 0100, the crew on the bridge heard something unusual port side. While a body wasn‚Äôt officially seen when they rushed over to look, it was noted that there was something in the water as the ship continued forward‚Äù.

More people from the mess decks got up and left visually distraught.

‚ÄúAt that point we issued a man overboard while the ship turned back around to investigate. Unfortunately, we were not able to get eyes on what they saw before, but as you know, it was found that Carter did not make it to her muster station. Her family has been made aware, and I request that anyone who has any questions, or wants to talk, please feel free to come to me or the ship‚Äôs Chaplain, Lieutenant Anderson. Thank you all for the hard work and valiant efforts in your search last night everyone. More than ever can I say I‚Äôve never been prouder to lead this vessel after seeing the dedication in trying to save one of your ship mates. Rest easy, Naomi, we have the watch.‚Äù

The PA cutout and I found I had lost my appetite as well. I wouldn‚Äôt have called Carter a friend, but she was always cordial, albeit a little reserved. I placed my dishes in the scullery and headed to my rack for a quick nap before my next watch.

Since that night, I found Nicolas absent from our normal nightly meeting spot near the front of the ship. Actually, he had been absent not just the next night, but the entire time afterwards as well.

I passed him a few times sporadically as he seemed to be spending a lot more time with the Captain, but he hardly spared me a glance. His attitude looked to have change significantly however as I rarely saw him talking to anyone anymore other than in an official capacity, and his confident gait was now replaced with a tired shuffle.

I decided to give him some space and went back to my normal duties.

About five weeks into our voyage, a rumor spread like wildfire that we‚Äôd be pulling into another port in a few days. You could feel the shift in energy filling the ship as people readied themselves to stretch their legs and get the hell of this tin can. It didn‚Äôt help that we were overdue for a port visit at this point, as we were supposed to have made a stop the week prior, but it was canceled due to some mechanical issues we ran into that slowed our progress.

It was also unspoken that this change in scenery would help take people‚Äôs minds off of Carter‚Äôs disappearance two weeks earlier.

Excited to tell Nicolas the news and hopefully strike up another conversation, I found he was absent at both breakfast and dinner that evening. And though this might normally would have been noticed by others, conversations were now constantly abuzz with plans for once we hit our next port. Who they were going to group with, where they were going to go, where was the nearest bar.

Camacho sat next to me at the dinner table.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the move Angelo? Wanna come with once we hit the pier?‚Äù Camacho said as he shoveled food into his mouth.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù I said looking around the mess decks. ‚ÄúBeen wanting to ask Nicolas what his plans were but I haven‚Äôt seen him recently.‚Äù

Camacho took a drink of water before looking at me questioningly.

‚ÄúNice enough guy‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôll be up to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNot doing so swell kid, saw it myself. Was walking around, doing my rounds about one AM a few nights ago, noticed him in one of the hallways back aft all hunched over. Was bracing himself against a wall and breathing pretty rough.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ran over to see if he was alright‚Äù, Camacho continued after another bite. ‚ÄúOnce he noticed me, he just told me to grab Captain Merriman.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Captain?‚Äù I questioned. ‚ÄúPretty sure Doc would have been a little more help.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I told him‚Äù Camacho recounted as his eyebrows furrowed, ‚Äúand I wasn‚Äôt about to be the one to wake up the Captain at one o‚Äôclock in the morning because some civilian got a little sea-sick. But when I got close enough to try and prop him up, he grabbed my arm and said it again, a little more...*forcefully...*‚Äù.

‚ÄúStronger than he looks the lanky bastard‚Äù Camacho muttered under his breath. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs a persuasive fella, and I‚Äôm guessin‚Äô that the Captain has some sort of arrangement with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúWell as soon as I made my way up and told Cap‚Äô what was going on, he told me thanks. Said I was relieved from my rounds for the night, and he headed straight towards that string bean.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask him what was going on?‚Äù I asked in surprise.

‚ÄúKid-er-Angelo...‚Äù, Camacho corrected himself. ‚ÄúDammit I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs second nature man. Angelo when the Captain tells ya to do something, ya do it. That‚Äôs it. And anyway, I had 3 more hours of rounds that night that I didn‚Äôt have to do anymore. I wasn‚Äôt about to ask any more questions that would change that.‚Äù

He shifted in his seat before finishing his thought.

‚ÄúOl‚Äô Merriman‚Äôs a pretty salty Captain though. Never once saw the guy shaken up these past few years. And to the old man‚Äôs credit his face was *almost* solid stone as it normally is. But even at night with the red lights switched on around the ship I could tell Cap was white as a ghost...angry too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway‚Äù, Camacho said, changing the subject. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that guy, I‚Äôm sure we would have heard, or smelled by now if he croaked over. Just let me know if ya wanna tag along once we pull in. Should be a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho knows‚Äù he added with a jab to my arm, ‚Äúmaybe Katie will be there too‚Äù.

We finished up our meal and headed our respective ways. I decided to skip my nightly star gazing and head straight to my watch station, lost in thought about Camacho‚Äôs run-in with Nicolas.

You've just come out of dental surgery. Whether it was a wisdom tooth extraction, a gum graft, or an implant procedure, there's one thing you're probably feeling right now: the need to recover well, without setbacks or unnecessary pain. In Singapore, with its spicy food culture and humid climate, your healing process might need just a little more attention. With the right steps, you‚Äôll feel better sooner than you think, especially when you're in the care of a trusted[ dental surgeon Singapore](https://dentalessence.com.sg/).

1. **Don‚Äôt Guess Your Way Through Recovery. Stick to What Your Dentist Says**

You‚Äôre probably feeling a bit out of it right after surgery, maybe a little sore or foggy. That‚Äôs normal. But when you‚Äôre home, what really matters is following the post-op instructions. This isn‚Äôt the time to wing it or skip a few steps because you‚Äôre feeling okay. Your dentist knows exactly how your body needs to heal, and those instructions are based on that. So if your oral surgery specialist in Singapore says no rinsing for 24 hours or tells you to stay on a soft diet for a day or two, take it seriously. If anything seems unclear, don‚Äôt try to figure it out alone. Just pick up the phone and ask.

1. **Bleeding After Surgery? Don‚Äôt Panic. Here‚Äôs What to Do**

A bit of blood on your gauze isn‚Äôt something to stress over. It's actually expected. But you‚Äôve got to manage it. Bite down gently but firmly on the gauze your dentist gave you. Leave it in place for a minimum of 30 minutes. If it gets soaked, switch it out. Try not to talk too much or walk around. Lie back, rest, and let your body focus on clotting. With Singapore‚Äôs heat, you can push yourself too hard without even noticing. If bleeding doesn‚Äôt slow or feels like too much, don‚Äôt wait. Call your clinic and ask what‚Äôs next.

1. **Swollen? Cold Compresses Can Be Your Best Friend**

Swelling can sneak up on you. At first, you might feel fine, but by the evening your face might feel puffier than expected. Here‚Äôs the deal: ice early, and ice right. Take a clean cloth, wrap some ice in it, and press it gently to the side of your face where the procedure happened. Stick to sessions of 15 to 20 minutes each time. Then take a break before going again. Repeat this for the first 24 hours. It‚Äôs not just about comfort. It helps reduce long-term swelling too. And with Singapore‚Äôs warm, humid weather, cooling down brings relief in more ways than one.

1. **You‚Äôre Not Lazy. Your Body Just Needs Rest**

You might think, ""I‚Äôll bounce back fast,"" or ""I‚Äôve got things to do."" But if there‚Äôs one time to slow down, it‚Äôs now. For at least the first 48 hours, you‚Äôll want to skip gym sessions, walks in the sun, or even long errands. Movement raises blood pressure, and that can reopen wounds or increase swelling. Settle in, keep your head elevated when lying down, and take short naps if your body needs them. Healing isn‚Äôt about doing nothing. It‚Äôs about doing what matters most. Right now, that‚Äôs rest.

1. **Spicy Cravings? Put Them on Hold. Your Mouth Isn‚Äôt Ready**

This one‚Äôs tough, especially if your go-to comfort foods are full of flavour. Laksa, curry puffs, sambal, just not yet. Stick to soft, mild foods like mashed potatoes, congee, smoothies, and yoghurt. Even porridge can do wonders, especially when it‚Äôs cooled down and easy to swallow. For the first few days, stay away from foods that are hot, spicy, or crunchy. A seed stuck in a healing socket or a bit of chilli irritating fresh stitches isn‚Äôt worth it. If you‚Äôve just had a wisdom tooth extraction in Singapore, this step could mean the difference between smooth healing and painful dry socket.

1. **Cleaning Your Mouth? Be Gentle, Not Brave**

Oral hygiene doesn‚Äôt stop after surgery, but you‚Äôll need to approach it differently. Don‚Äôt brush near the surgery site on the first day. From day two, go slow with a soft-bristled brush. Don‚Äôt scrub. And avoid strong mouthwashes unless your dentist gives you the green light. Instead, use a saltwater rinse. Just half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water. Rinse gently, a few times a day, especially after meals. If you've had surgical dental treatment like a graft or implant, this care helps protect all the work that was done.

1. **Skip the Smoke and Toss the Straw. Protect Your Healing**

You may be in the habit of sipping iced coffee through a straw or reaching for a cigarette when stressed. But right now, those actions can undo everything your dentist just worked so hard to fix. Smoking slows down healing and increases your chances of complications. Straws create suction, and that suction can pull out the blood clot that's keeping your wound protected. Even alcohol can irritate healing tissue or interfere with medications. If you‚Äôve just visited a dental implant clinic, trust that your aftercare is as important as the procedure itself. Give yourself the space to heal fully.

1. **When Something Feels Off, Don‚Äôt Brush It Aside**

Pain should ease, not get worse. You know your body. If something feels wrong, maybe your jaw starts to ache more after three days, or you notice a foul taste, swelling that won‚Äôt calm down, or a fever, don‚Äôt ignore it. These might be signs that you need extra care. Contact your dentist. It‚Äôs better to check than wait. Dentists in Singapore are responsive, and early support makes healing smoother.

**Your Environment Matters. Make Healing Easier at Home**

The way you set up your recovery space can help more than you think. Keep your room cool with air conditioning, but don‚Äôt let it get too dry. Sip plain water throughout the day. Avoid sugary drinks or bubble tea, no matter how tempting. If you're ordering in, make special requests. Ask for no spice, no seeds, and soft textures. You don‚Äôt need to cook fancy meals. Just simple, soft dishes can support your healing without effort.

**Stay on Track with Follow-ups and Future Options**

Don‚Äôt skip your follow-up visit just because you feel better. That appointment helps your dentist make sure you‚Äôre healing as expected. They‚Äôll spot things you can‚Äôt see. And if you‚Äôre thinking about tooth replacement options in Singapore later on like implants, bridges, or other solutions, how you heal now lays the foundation. Trust matters too. Keep in touch with your dental surgeon and build that long-term care relationship. It makes everything easier, from your next check-up to your next smile upgrade.

Is this wise?,"We broke up a month ago, and I was doing well mentally for the last few weeks and I was even convincing myself that it's for the best and was hearing everything my friends where saying (putting me on the pedestal), except yesterday where I broken down after I was planning to go on a date, cancelled it, and found the last gift I was given from her, so I messaged her after nearly a month of no contact, wanted to see how she is doing. Needless to say she told me she's well but wanted to tell me herself she has a gender crisis. I've always knew she was bi, she was with girls an guys before me, yet yesterday she told me she feels she thinks she's more inclined to being a lesbian and is seeking therapy for that. Of course a part of me know feels relaxed, that at the very least it's not something I could ever give her, since I want to believe I tried and did everything, yet it still broke me. Hadn't cried for weeks, yesterday and this morning, I am and so I decided to write this letter. A part of me says send it, who cares. Not expecting a reply... although I would want one. A part of me know is 99% sure that we can never be together again, although there is still that small thing that still clings to hope. 

**My dear X,**

I don‚Äôt know what to call this, a letter? A goodbye? A whisper into the dark, hoping you might hear it? I only know that I miss you, and I carry you with me still, every day.

We don't speak like we used to, and I know why. I know we ended things, and I respect that. But some feelings don‚Äôt switch off when the relationship does. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this, not to change anything, not to ask for anything, but just to say what I‚Äôve been holding in.

I adored you. I think I still do although I try and convince myself I'm not. You were my first everything, the first person who made me feel seen, trusted, and truly loved. With you, the world felt more colorful, the quiet moments more full. Even the silly things, like cooking noodles, felt like magic.

I understand now that you‚Äôve been going through something deep, something about who you are at your core. I can‚Äôt pretend to fully understand, but I know it must have taken strength and courage to be honest with yourself, and with me. Even if it broke us.

I‚Äôll be honest: it hurts. There‚Äôs still a part of me that wants to believe this could all rewind, that we could try again, differently, better. But another part, the part that loves you purely, knows I have to let you go. You‚Äôre becoming who you‚Äôre meant to be, and I want that for you. Truly.

Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm waiting for your message, or that little typing bubble to show up. Other times I tell myself I‚Äôm over it, that I‚Äôm moving on. But it‚Äôs a strange grief, you‚Äôre alive, yet unreachable. I want to send that message, asking you to go for a coffee, yet I know I shouldn't. Like I lost my best friend and my love all at once.

Still, I want you to know this: I‚Äôll never regret loving you. I‚Äôll never forget the version of me you brought out. And even though I know you want me to one day love again, and so do I for you. A part of my heart will always belong to us and doesn't want to love anyone else. 

Wherever life takes you, I hope it‚Äôs kind. I hope you find peace and joy in ways you never imagined. I‚Äôll be over here, healing in my own way, quietly cheering for you.

With love,  
Y

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal leather little backpack offers a harmonious balance of style, functionality, and durability. Let's explore some of the key features that set the best options apart.**Material Quality:** The quality of the leather is paramount. Full-grain leather, known for its durability and natural beauty, will age gracefully, developing a rich patina over time. Top-grain leather offers a similar aesthetic at a slightly lower price point, while genuine leather, though more affordable, may not be as resilient. Look for a backpack crafted from high-quality leather that feels supple, strong, and resistant to scratches and wear.

**Construction and Stitching:** A well-constructed backpack is built to last.Examine the stitching closely, as it should be even, tight, and free of loose threads. Reinforced stress points, such as the straps and corners, are crucial for withstanding daily use. pay attention to the hardware,opting for durable materials like solid brass or stainless steel that won't easily tarnish or break. A sturdy zipper with smooth action is also essential for securing your belongings.

**Compartment Organization:** A thoughtfully designed interior enhances the backpack's practicality. Consider the number and size of compartments, pockets, and organizational features. A dedicated padded sleeve for a tablet or small laptop is a valuable addition, as are interior pockets for storing essentials like your phone, wallet, and keys. An exterior pocket for easy access to frequently used items can also be highly convenient.

**Size and capacity:** The ""little"" in leather little backpack implies a compact size, but the specific dimensions can vary. Consider the overall capacity and whether it meets your needs for carrying daily essentials. Too small, and you'll be constantly struggling to fit everything in; too large, and it loses its charmingly petite silhouette. Look for backpacks with adjustable straps to ensure a pleasant and secure fit, regardless of your body shape.

Key features of the best leather little backpacks include:

* Premium full-grain or top-grain leather
* Durable construction with reinforced stitching
* Thoughtfully designed compartments and pockets
* Adjustable straps for a comfortable fit

A leather little backpack elevates your style from casual to chic, making it a suitable accessory for a variety of occasions, from weekend outings to upscale events. The rich texture and natural beauty of the leather create a timeless appeal that complements both classic and contemporary fashion trends.

**Hands-Free Convenience:** Unlike traditional handbags or shoulder bags, a backpack allows you to keep your hands free for othre tasks, such as holding a coffee, checking your phone, or navigating a crowded street. This is particularly beneficial for commuters, travelers, and anyone who values convenience and ease of movement in their daily life. The evenly distributed weight also reduces strain on your shoulders and back.

**Compact and Lightweight:** The ""little"" size of these backpacks makes them ideal for carrying only the essentials without weighing you down.This is a meaningful advantage over larger backpacks or bulky bags, especially during travel or when you want to maintain a minimalist aesthetic.The lightweight design ensures that you can carry your belongings comfortably throughout the day,without feeling burdened or restricted.

## faqs Section

Finding the right leather backpack can bring up several questions. Here are some common concerns addressed.

**What are the best ways to care for a leather little backpack?**
Regular cleaning and conditioning are essential for maintaining the beauty and longevity of your leather backpack. Use a soft cloth to wipe away dust and dirt regularly. Apply a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out. Avoid exposing the backpack to excessive moisture or direct sunlight, as this can damage the leather. Store it in a dust bag when not in use.

**Can a leather little backpack accommodate a tablet or e-reader?**
Many leather little backpacks are designed with a dedicated padded sleeve that can comfortably accommodate a tablet or e-reader. Check the product specifications to ensure that the sleeve is the right size for your device. Even if there isn't a dedicated sleeve, you can often use one of the interior compartments, providing it is adequately protected by a case.

**What is the difference between full-grain and top-grain leather?**
Full-grain leather is the highest quality leather, made from the entire grain of the hide. It is the strongest and most durable type of leather, and it develops a gorgeous patina over time. Top-grain leather is the second-highest quality leather, where the top layer has been sanded and a finish coat added. It is still durable and aesthetically pleasing, but it lacks the unique character of full-grain leather.

Started as research for my own project, but turned into this deep rabbit hole that I think other entrepreneurs might find interesting.

**The weird thing about expense trackers**

Everyone hates them but keeps trying new ones. I interviewed a bunch of people (friends, family, random folks on Facebook groups) and found some patterns that surprised me.

**Most people quit after like 3 weeks.** Not because the apps are bad, but because life gets in the way. You forget to log a coffee, then feel guilty, then avoid the app entirely. It's this weird psychological thing.

**Bank sync is overrated.** Sounds great in theory, but my Mint connection broke every month. Plus, you still gotta categorize everything manually. And good luck with cash purchases or splitting dinner with friends.

**People want to talk about money, not fill out forms.** This was the big insight for me. The couples who successfully budget together? They're constantly talking about purchases. ""Hey, I spent $50 on groceries."" It's conversational, not transactional.

**What I'm building**

Called it CashChat because that's basically what it is - chatting about your expenses. Instead of opening an app and filling out Amount/Category/Description, you just type ""bought coffee for $5"" and it figures out the rest.

I've been working on it for three months now. Flutter app with some AI stuff for the chat interface and receipt scanning. Still early, but the prototype feels pretty good.

The family sharing feature is what I'm most excited about. It's real-time expense sharing without the complexity of other apps. My wife and I have been testing it, and it's actually fun to use, which is unusual for a finance app.

**Questions for you all**

Anyone else tried building in fintech? The regulations seem scary, but maybe I'm overthinking it.

Also, curious about pricing. Would you rather pay $5/month or $50 once for lifetime access? I keep going back and forth on this.

And if you've built consumer apps - how do you know when to launch? I keep wanting to add more features, but probably should just ship something simple first.",2,1753246159.0,indiehackers,1,1.0,False

Between the headache from the loud-ass music and the nausea from the weed odor, I‚Äôll be amazed if I cross the room without spilling my drink.  
  
¬† We break out the crowd. Big D‚Äôs house is packed wall-to-wall. I‚Äôve always heard that everybody and their momma comes to his spring break parties‚Äîwell, everybody except me‚Äîbut damn, I didn‚Äôt know it would be this many people. Girls wear their hair colored, curled, laid, and slayed. Got me feeling basic as hell with my ponytail. Guys in their freshest kicks and sagging pants grind so close to girls they just about need condoms. My nana likes to say that spring brings love. Spring in Garden Heights doesn‚Äôt always bring love, but it promises babies in the winter. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a lot of them are conceived the night of Big D‚Äôs party. He always has it on the Friday of spring break because you need Saturday to recover and Sunday to repent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop following me and go dance, Starr,‚Äù Kenya says. ‚ÄúPeople already say you think you all that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know so many mind readers lived in Garden Heights.‚Äù Or that people know me as anything other than ‚ÄúBig Mav‚Äôs daughter who works in the store.‚Äù I sip my drink and spit it back out. I knew there would be more than Hawaiian Punch in it, but this is way stronger than I‚Äôm used to. They shouldn‚Äôt even call it punch. Just straight-up liquor. I put it on the coffee table and say, ‚ÄúFolks kill me, thinking they know what I think.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm just saying. You act like you don‚Äôt know nobody ‚Äôcause you go to that school.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôve been hearing that for six years, ever since my parents put me in Williamson Prep. ‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù I mumble.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd it wouldn‚Äôt kill you to not dress like . . .‚Äù She turns up her nose as she looks from my sneakers to my oversized hoodie. ‚ÄúThat. Ain‚Äôt that my brother‚Äôs hoodie?‚Äù  
  
¬† Our brother‚Äôs hoodie. Kenya and I share an older brother, Seven. But she and I aren‚Äôt related. Her momma is Seven‚Äôs momma, and my dad is Seven‚Äôs dad. Crazy, I know. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs his.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFigures. You know what else people saying too. Got folks thinking you‚Äôre my girlfriend.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo I look like I care what people think?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo! And that‚Äôs the problem!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù If I‚Äôd known following her to this party meant she‚Äôd be on some Extreme Makeover: Starr Edition mess, I would‚Äôve stayed home and watched Fresh Prince reruns. My Jordans are comfortable, and damn, they‚Äôre new. That‚Äôs more than some people can say. The hoodie‚Äôs way too big, but I like it that way. Plus, if I pull it over my nose, I can‚Äôt smell the weed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I ain‚Äôt babysitting you all night, so you better do something,‚Äù Kenya says, and scopes the room. Kenya could be a model, if I‚Äôm completely honest. She‚Äôs got flawless dark-brown skin‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think she ever gets a pimple‚Äîslanted brown eyes, and long eyelashes that aren‚Äôt store-bought. She‚Äôs the perfect height for modeling too, but a little thicker than those toothpicks on the runway. She never wears the same outfit twice. Her daddy, King, makes sure of that.  
  
¬† Kenya is about the only person I hang out with in Garden Heights‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to make friends when you go to a school that‚Äôs forty-five minutes away and you‚Äôre a latchkey kid who‚Äôs only seen at her family‚Äôs store. It‚Äôs easy to hang out with Kenya because of our connection to Seven. She‚Äôs messy as hell sometimes, though. Always fighting somebody and quick to say her daddy will whoop somebody‚Äôs ass. Yeah, it‚Äôs true, but I wish she‚Äôd stop picking fights so she can use her trump card. Hell, I could use mine too. Everybody knows you don‚Äôt mess with my dad, Big Mav, and you definitely don‚Äôt mess with his kids. Still, you don‚Äôt see me going around starting shit.  
  
¬† Like at Big D‚Äôs party, Kenya is giving Denasia Allen some serious stank-eye. I don‚Äôt remember much about Denasia, but I remember that she and Kenya haven‚Äôt liked each other since fourth grade. Tonight, Denasia‚Äôs dancing with some guy halfway across the room and paying no attention to Kenya. But no matter where we move, Kenya spots Denasia and glares at her. And the thing about the stank-eye is at some point you feel it on you, inviting you to kick some ass or have your ass kicked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOoh! I can‚Äôt stand her,‚Äù Kenya seethes. ‚ÄúThe other day, we were in line in the cafeteria, right? And she behind me, talking out the side of her neck. She didn‚Äôt use my name, but I know she was talking ‚Äôbout me, saying I tried to get with DeVante.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFor real?‚Äù I say what I‚Äôm supposed to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh-huh. I don‚Äôt want him.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Honestly? I don‚Äôt know who DeVante is. ‚ÄúSo what did you do?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat you think I did? I turned around and asked if she had a problem with me. Ol‚Äô trick, gon‚Äô say, ‚ÄòI wasn‚Äôt even talking about you,‚Äô knowing she was! You‚Äôre so lucky you go to that white-people school and don‚Äôt have to deal with hoes like that.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ain‚Äôt this some shit? Not even five minutes ago, I was stuck-up because I go to Williamson. Now I‚Äôm lucky? ‚ÄúTrust me, my school has hoes too. Hoedom is universal.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWatch, we gon‚Äô handle her tonight.‚Äù Kenya‚Äôs stank-eye reaches its highest level of stank. Denasia feels its sting and looks right at Kenya. ‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù Kenya confirms, like Denasia hears her. ‚ÄúWatch.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHold up. We? That‚Äôs why you begged me to come to this party? So you can have a tag team partner?‚Äù  
  
¬† She has the nerve to look offended. ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt like you had nothing else to do! Or anybody else to hang out with. I‚Äôm doing your ass a favor.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally, Kenya? You do know I have friends, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† She rolls her eyes. Hard. Only the whites are visible for a few seconds. ‚ÄúThem li‚Äôl bougie girls from your school don‚Äôt count.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not bougie, and they do count.‚Äù I think. Maya and I are cool. Not sure what‚Äôs up with me and Hailey lately. ‚ÄúAnd honestly? If pulling me into a fight is your way of helping my social life, I‚Äôm good. Goddamn, it‚Äôs always some drama with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, Starr?‚Äù She stretches the please extra long. Too long. ‚ÄúThis what I‚Äôm thinking. We wait until she get away from DeVante, right? And  
then we . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† My phone vibrates against my thigh, and I glance at the screen. Since I‚Äôve ignored his calls, Chris texts me instead.  
  
¬† Can we talk?  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt mean for it to go like that.  
  
¬† Of course he didn‚Äôt. He meant for it to go a whole different way yesterday, which is the problem. I slip the phone in my pocket. I‚Äôm not sure what I wanna say, but I‚Äôd rather deal with him later.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKenya!‚Äù somebody shouts.  
  
¬† This big, light-skinned girl with bone-straight hair moves through the crowd toward us. A tall boy with a black-and-blond Fro-hawk follows her. They both give Kenya hugs and talk about how cute she looks. I‚Äôm not even here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy you ain‚Äôt tell me you was coming?‚Äù the girl says, and sticks her thumb in her mouth. She‚Äôs got an overbite from doing that too. ‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve rode with us.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, girl. I had to go get Starr,‚Äù Kenya says. ‚ÄúWe walked here together.‚Äù  
  
¬† That‚Äôs when they notice me, standing not even half a foot from Kenya.  
  
¬† The guy squints as he gives me a quick once-over. He frowns for a hot second, but I notice it. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt you Big Mav‚Äôs daughter who work in the store?‚Äù  
  
¬† See? People act like that‚Äôs the name on my birth certificate. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOhhh!‚Äù the girl says. ‚ÄúI knew you looked familiar. We were in third grade together. Ms. Bridges‚Äôs class. I sat behind you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I know this is the moment I‚Äôm supposed to remember her, but I don‚Äôt. I guess Kenya was right‚ÄîI really don‚Äôt know anybody. Their faces are familiar, but you don‚Äôt get names and life stories when you‚Äôre bagging folks‚Äô groceries.  
  
¬† I can lie though. ‚ÄúYeah, I remember you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGirl, quit lying,‚Äù the guy says. ‚ÄúYou know you don‚Äôt know her ass.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚ÄòWhy you always lying?‚Äô‚Äù Kenya and the girl sing together. The guy joins in, and they all bust out laughing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBianca and Chance, be nice,‚Äù Kenya says. ‚ÄúThis Starr‚Äôs first party. Her folks don‚Äôt let her go nowhere.‚Äù  
  
¬† I cut her a side-eye. ‚ÄúI go to parties, Kenya.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave y‚Äôall seen her at any parties ‚Äôround here?‚Äù Kenya asks them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPoint made. And before you say it, li‚Äôl lame white-kid suburb parties don‚Äôt count.‚Äù  
  
¬† Chance and Bianca snicker. Damn, I wish this hoodie could swallow me up somehow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI bet they be doing Molly and shit, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù Chance asks me. ‚ÄúWhite kids love popping pills.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd listening to Taylor Swift,‚Äù Bianca adds, talking around her thumb.  
  
¬† Okay, that‚Äôs somewhat true, but I‚Äôm not telling them that. ‚ÄúNah, actually their parties are pretty dope,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúOne time, this boy had J. Cole perform at his birthday party.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn. For real?‚Äù Chance asks. ‚ÄúShiiit. Bitch, next time invite me. I‚Äôll party with them white kids.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù Kenya says loudly. ‚ÄúWe were talking ‚Äôbout running up on Denasia. Bitch over there dancing with DeVante.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOl‚Äô trick,‚Äù Bianca says. ‚ÄúYou know she been running her mouth ‚Äôbout you, right? I was in Mr. Donald‚Äôs class last week when Aaliyah told me‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Chance rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúUgh! Mr. Donald.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou just mad he threw you out,‚Äù Kenya says.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHell yes!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnyway, Aaliyah told me‚Äî‚Äù Bianca begins.  
  
¬† I get lost again as classmates and teachers that I don‚Äôt know are discussed. I can‚Äôt say anything. Doesn‚Äôt matter though. I‚Äôm invisible.  
  
¬† I feel like that a lot around here.  
  
¬† In the middle of them complaining about Denasia and their teachers, Kenya says something about getting another drink, and the three of them walk off without me.  
  
¬† Suddenly I‚Äôm Eve in the Garden after she ate the fruit‚Äîit‚Äôs like I realize I‚Äôm naked. I‚Äôm by myself at a party I‚Äôm not even supposed to be at, where I barely know anybody. And the person I do know just left me hanging.  
  
¬† Kenya begged me to come to this party for weeks. I knew I‚Äôd be uncomfortable as hell, but every time I told Kenya no she said I act like I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo good for a Garden party.‚Äù I got tired of hearing that shit and decided to prove her wrong. Problem is it would‚Äôve taken Black Jesus to convince my parents to let me come. Now Black Jesus will have to save me if they find out I‚Äôm here.  
  
¬† People glance over at me with that ‚Äúwho is this chick, standing against the wall by herself like an idiot?‚Äù look. I slip my hands into my pockets. As long as I play it cool and keep to myself, I should be fine. The ironic thing is though, at Williamson I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúplay it cool‚Äù‚ÄîI‚Äôm cool by default because I‚Äôm one of the only black kids there. I have to earn coolness in Garden Heights, and that‚Äôs more difficult than buying retro Jordans on release day.  
  
¬† Funny how it works with white kids though. It‚Äôs dope to be black until it‚Äôs hard to be black.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStarr!‚Äù a familiar voice says.  
  
¬† The sea of people parts for him like he‚Äôs a brown-skinned Moses. Guys give him daps, and girls crane their necks to look at him. He smiles at me, and his dimples ruin any G persona he has.  
  
¬† Khalil is fine, no other way of putting it. And I used to take baths with him. Not like that, but way back in the day when we would giggle because he had a wee-wee and I had what his grandma called a wee-ha. I swear it wasn‚Äôt perverted though.  
  
¬† He hugs me, smelling like soap and baby powder. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, girl? Ain‚Äôt seen you in a minute.‚Äù He lets me go. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt text nobody, nothing. Where you been?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSchool and the basketball team keep me busy,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm always at the store. You‚Äôre the one nobody sees anymore.‚Äù  
  
¬† His dimples disappear. He wipes his nose like he always does before a lie. ‚ÄúI been busy.‚Äù  
  
¬† Obviously. The brand-new Jordans, the crisp white tee, the diamonds in his ears. When you grow up in Garden Heights, you know what ‚Äúbusy‚Äù really means.  
  
¬† Fuck. I wish he wasn‚Äôt that kinda busy though. I don‚Äôt know if I wanna tear up or smack him.  
  
¬† But the way Khalil looks at me with those hazel eyes makes it hard to be upset. I feel like I‚Äôm ten again, standing in the basement of Christ Temple Church, having my first kiss with him at Vacation Bible School. Suddenly I remember I‚Äôm in a hoodie, looking a straight-up mess . . . and that I actually have a boyfriend. I might not be answering Chris‚Äôs calls or texts right now, but he‚Äôs still mine and I wanna keep it that way.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your grandma?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúAnd Cameron?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey a‚Äôight. Grandma‚Äôs sick though.‚Äù Khalil sips from his cup. ‚ÄúDoctors say she got cancer or whatever.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn. Sorry, K.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, she taking chemo. She only worried ‚Äôbout getting a wig though.‚Äù He gives a weak laugh that doesn‚Äôt show his dimples. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be a‚Äôight.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs a prayer more than a prophecy. ‚ÄúIs your momma helping with Cameron?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood ol‚Äô Starr. Always looking for the best in people. You know she ain‚Äôt helping.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, it was just a question. She came in the store the other day. She looks better.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù says Khalil. ‚ÄúShe claim she trying to get clean, but it‚Äôs the usual. She‚Äôll go clean a few weeks, decide she wants one more hit, then be back at it. But like I said, I‚Äôm good, Cameron‚Äôs good, Grandma‚Äôs good.‚Äù He shrugs. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say, but I remember the nights I spent with Khalil on his porch, waiting for his momma to come home. Whether he likes it or not, she matters to him too.  
  
¬† The music changes, and Drake raps from the speakers. I nod to the beat and rap along under my breath. Everybody on the dance floor yells out the ‚Äústarted from the bottom, now we‚Äôre here‚Äù part. Some days, we are at the bottom in Garden Heights, but we still share the feeling that damn, it could be worse.  
  
¬† Khalil is watching me. A smile tries to form on his lips, but he shakes his head. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe you still love whiny-ass Drake.‚Äù  
  
¬† I gape at him. ‚ÄúLeave my  
husband alone!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour corny husband. ‚ÄòBaby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted,‚Äô‚Äù Khalil sings in a whiny voice. I push him with my shoulder, and he laughs, his drink splashing over the sides of the cup. ‚ÄúYou know that‚Äôs what he sounds like!‚Äù  
  
¬† I flip him off. He puckers his lips and makes a kissing sound. All these months apart, and we‚Äôve fallen back into normal like it‚Äôs nothing.  
  
¬† Khalil grabs a napkin from the coffee table and wipes drink off his Jordans‚Äîthe Three Retros. They came out a few years ago, but I swear those things are so fresh. They cost about three hundred dollars, and that‚Äôs if you find somebody on eBay who goes easy. Chris did. I got mine for a steal at one-fifty, but I wear kid sizes. Thanks to my small feet, Chris and I can match our sneakers. Yes, we‚Äôre that couple. Shit, we‚Äôre fly though. If he can stop doing stupid stuff, we‚Äôll really be good.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like the kicks,‚Äù I tell Khalil.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù He scrubs the shoes with his napkin. I cringe. With each hard rub, the shoes cry for my help. No lie, every time a sneaker is cleaned improperly, a kitten dies.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKhalil,‚Äù I say, one second away from snatching that napkin. ‚ÄúEither wipe gently back and forth or dab. Don‚Äôt scrub. For real.‚Äù  
  
¬† He looks up at me, smirking. ‚ÄúOkay, Ms. Sneakerhead.‚Äù And thank Black Jesus, he dabs. ‚ÄúSince you made me spill my drink on them, I oughta make you clean them.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll cost you sixty dollars.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSixty?‚Äù he shouts, straightening up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHell, yeah. And it would be eighty if they had icy soles.‚Äù Clear bottoms are a bitch to clean. ‚ÄúCleaning kits aren‚Äôt cheap. Besides, you‚Äôre obviously making big money if you can buy those.‚Äù  
  
¬† Khalil sips his drink like I didn‚Äôt say anything, mutters, ‚ÄúDamn, this shit strong,‚Äù and sets the cup on the coffee table. ‚ÄúAy, tell your pops I need to holla at him soon. Some stuff going down that I need to talk to him ‚Äôbout.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat kinda stuff?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGrown folks business.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, ‚Äôcause you‚Äôre so grown.‚Äù  
Five months, two weeks, and three days older than you.‚Äù He winks. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt forgot.‚Äù  
  
¬† A commotion stirs in the middle of the dance floor. Voices argue louder than the music. Cuss words fly left and right.  
  
¬† My first thought? Kenya walked up on Denasia like she promised. But the voices are deeper than theirs.  
  
¬† Pop! A shot rings out. I duck.  
  
¬† Pop! A second shot. The crowd stampedes toward the door, which leads to more cussing and fighting since it‚Äôs impossible for everybody to get out at once.  
  
¬† Khalil grabs my hand. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon.‚Äù  
  
¬† There are way too many people and way too much curly hair for me to catch a glimpse of Kenya. ‚ÄúBut Kenya‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúForget her, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù  
  
¬† He pulls me through the crowd, shoving people out our way and stepping on shoes. That alone could get us some bullets. I look for Kenya among the panicked faces, but still no sign of her. I don‚Äôt try to see who got shot or who did it. You can‚Äôt snitch if you don‚Äôt know anything.  
  
¬† Cars speed away outside, and people run into the night in any direction where shots aren‚Äôt firing off. Khalil leads me to a Chevy Impala parked under a dim streetlight. He pushes me in through the driver‚Äôs side, and I climb into the passenger seat. We screech off, leaving chaos in the rearview mirror.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlways some shit,‚Äù he mumbles. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt have a party without somebody getting shot.‚Äù  
  
¬† He sounds like my parents. That‚Äôs exactly why they don‚Äôt let me ‚Äúgo nowhere,‚Äù as Kenya puts it. At least not around Garden Heights.  
  
¬† I send Kenya a text, hoping she‚Äôs all right. Doubt those bullets were meant for her, but bullets go where they wanna go.  
  
¬† Kenya texts back kinda quick.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm fine.  
  
¬† I see that bitch tho. Bout to handle her ass.  
  
¬† Where u at?  
  
¬† Is this chick for real? We just ran for our lives, and she‚Äôs ready to fight? I don‚Äôt even answer that dumb shit.  
  
¬† Khalil‚Äôs Impala is nice. Not all flashy like some guys‚Äô cars. I didn‚Äôt see any rims before I got in, and the front seat has cracks in the leather. But the interior is a tacky lime green, so it‚Äôs been customized at some point.  
  
¬† I pick at a crack in the seat. ‚ÄúWho you think got shot?‚Äù  
  
¬† Khalil gets his hairbrush out the compartment on the door. ‚ÄúProbably a King Lord,‚Äù he says, brushing the sides of his fade. ‚ÄúSome Garden Disciples came in when I got there. Something was bound to pop off.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod. Garden Heights has been a battlefield for the past two months over some stupid territory wars. I was born a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù ‚Äôcause Daddy used to be a King Lord. But when he left the game, my street royalty status ended. But even if I‚Äôd grown up in it, I wouldn‚Äôt understand fighting over streets nobody owns.  
  
¬† Khalil drops the brush in the door and cranks up his stereo, blasting an old rap song Daddy has played a million times. I frown. ‚ÄúWhy you always listening to that old stuff?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMan, get outta here! Tupac was the truth.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, twenty years ago.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, even now. Like, check this.‚Äù He points at me, which means he‚Äôs about to go into one of his Khalil philosophical moments. ‚Äú‚ÄôPac said Thug Life stood for ‚ÄòThe Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody.‚Äô‚Äù  
  
¬† I raise my eyebrows. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúListen! The Hate U‚Äîthe letter U‚ÄîGive Little Infants Fucks Everybody. T-H-U-G L-I-F-E. Meaning what society give us as youth, it bites them in the ass when we wild out. Get it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn. Yeah.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSee? Told you he was relevant.‚Äù He nods to the beat and raps along. But now I‚Äôm wondering what he‚Äôs doing to ‚Äúfuck everybody.‚Äù As much as I think I know, I hope I‚Äôm wrong. I need to hear it from him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo why have you really been busy?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúA few months ago Daddy said you quit the store. I haven‚Äôt seen you since.‚Äù  
  
¬† He scoots closer to the steering wheel. ‚ÄúWhere you want me to take you, your house or the store?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKhalil‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour house or the store?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre selling that stuff‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMind your business, Starr! Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äôbout me. I‚Äôm doing what I gotta do.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBullshit. You know my dad would help you out.‚Äù  
  
¬† He wipes his nose before his lie. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need help from nobody, okay? And that li‚Äôl minimum-wage job your pops gave me didn‚Äôt make nothing happen. I got tired of choosing between lights and food.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI thought your grandma was working.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe was. When she got sick, them clowns at the hospital claimed they‚Äôd work with her. Two months later, she wasn‚Äôt pulling her load on the job, ‚Äôcause when you‚Äôre going through chemo, you can‚Äôt pull big-ass garbage bins around. They fired her.‚Äù He shakes his head. ‚ÄúFunny, huh? The hospital fired her ‚Äôcause she was sick.‚Äù  
  
¬† It‚Äôs silent in the Impala except for Tupac asking who do you believe in? I don‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† My phone vibrates again, probably either Chris asking for forgiveness or Kenya asking for backup against Denasia. Instead, my big brother‚Äôs all-caps texts appear on the screen. I don‚Äôt know why he does that. He probably thinks it intimidates me. Really, it annoys the hell out of me.  
  
¬† WHERE R U?  
  
¬† U AND KENYA BETTER NOT BE @ THAT PARTY.  
  
¬† I HEARD SOMEBODY GOT SHOT.  
  
¬† The only thing worse than protective parents is protective older brothers. Even Black Jesus can‚Äôt save me from Seven.  
  
¬† Khalil glances over at me. ‚ÄúSeven, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you know?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚ÄôCause you always look like you wanna punch something when he talks to you. Remember that time at your birthday party when he kept telling you what to wish for?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd I popped him in his mouth.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen Natasha got mad at you for telling her ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô to shut up,‚Äù Khalil says, laughing.  
  
¬† I roll my eyes. ‚ÄúShe got on my nerves with her crush on Seven. Half the time, I thought she came over just to see him.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, it was because you had the Harry Potter movies. What we used to call ourselves? The Hood Trio. Tighter than‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe inside of Voldemort‚Äôs nose. We were so silly for that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, right?‚Äù he says.  
  
¬† We laugh, but something‚Äôs missing from it. Someone‚Äôs missing from it. Natasha.  
  
¬† Khalil looks at the road. ‚ÄúCrazy it‚Äôs been six years, you know?‚Äù  
  
¬† A whoop-whoop sound startles us, and blue lights flash in the rearview mirror.  
  
¬† TWO  
  
¬† When I was twelve, my parents had two talks with me.  
  
¬† One was the usual birds and bees. Well, I didn‚Äôt really get the usual version. My mom, Lisa, is a registered nurse, and she told me what went where, and what didn‚Äôt need to go here, there, or any damn where till I‚Äôm grown. Back then, I doubted anything was going anywhere anyway. While all the other girls sprouted breasts between sixth and seventh grade, my chest was as flat as my back.  
  
¬† The other talk was about what to do if a cop stopped me.  
  
¬† Momma fussed and told Daddy I was too young for that. He argued that I wasn‚Äôt too young to get arrested or shot.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStarr-Starr, you do whatever they tell you to do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKeep your hands visible. Don‚Äôt make any sudden moves. Only speak when they speak to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I knew it must‚Äôve been serious. Daddy has the biggest mouth of anybody I know, and if he said to be quiet, I needed to be quiet.  
  
¬† I hope somebody had the talk with Khalil.  
  
¬† He cusses under his breath, turns Tupac down, and maneuvers the Impala to the side of the street. We‚Äôre on Carnation where most of the houses are abandoned and half the streetlights are busted. Nobody around but us and the cop.  
  
¬† Khalil turns the ignition off. ‚ÄúWonder what this fool wants.‚Äù  
  
¬† The officer parks and puts his brights on. I blink to keep from being blinded.  
  
¬† I remember something else Daddy said. If you‚Äôre with somebody, you better hope they don‚Äôt have nothing on them, or both of y‚Äôall going  
down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúK, you don‚Äôt have anything in the car, do you?‚Äù I ask.  
  
¬† He watches the cop in his side mirror. ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù  
  
¬† The officer approaches the driver‚Äôs door and taps the window. Khalil cranks the handle to roll it down. As if we aren‚Äôt blinded enough, the officer beams his flashlight in our faces.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLicense, registration, and proof of insurance.‚Äù  
  
¬† Khalil breaks a rule‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt do what the cop wants. ‚ÄúWhat you pull us over for?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLicense, registration, and proof of insurance.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI said what you pull us over for?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKhalil,‚Äù I plead. ‚ÄúDo what he said.‚Äù  
  
¬† Khalil groans and takes his wallet out. The officer follows his movements with the flashlight.  
  
¬† My heart pounds loudly, but Daddy‚Äôs instructions echo in my head: Get a good look at the cop‚Äôs face. If you can remember his badge number, that‚Äôs even better.  
  
¬† With the flashlight following Khalil‚Äôs hands, I make out the numbers on the badge‚Äîone-fifteen. He‚Äôs white, midthirties to early forties, has a brown buzz cut and a thin scar over his top lip.  
  
¬† Khalil hands the officer his papers and license.  
  
¬† One-Fifteen looks over them. ‚ÄúWhere are you two coming from tonight?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNunya,‚Äù Khalil says, meaning none of your business. ‚ÄúWhat you pull me over for?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour taillight‚Äôs broken.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo are you gon‚Äô give me a ticket or what?‚Äù Khalil asks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know what? Get out the car, smart guy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMan, just give me my ticket‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGet out the car! Hands up, where I can see them.‚Äù  
  
¬† Khalil gets out with his hands up. One-Fifteen yanks him by his arm and pins him against the back door.  
  
¬† I fight to find my voice. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt mean‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHands on the dashboard!‚Äù the officer barks at me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move!‚Äù  
  
¬† I do what he tells me, but my hands are shaking too much to be still.  
  
¬† He pats Khalil down. ‚ÄúOkay, smart mouth, let‚Äôs see what we find on you today.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt gon‚Äô find nothing,‚Äù Khalil says.  
  
¬† One-Fifteen pats him down two more times. He turns up empty.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he tells Khalil. ‚ÄúAnd you.‚Äù He looks in the window at me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt even nod.  
  
¬† The officer walks back to his patrol car.  
  
¬† My parents haven‚Äôt raised me to fear the police, just to be smart around them. They told me it‚Äôs not smart to move while a cop has his back to you.  
  
¬† Khalil does. He comes to his door.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs not smart to make a sudden move.  
  
¬† Khalil does. He opens the driver‚Äôs door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou okay, Starr‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Pow!  
  
¬† One. Khalil‚Äôs body jerks. Blood splatters from his back. He holds on to the door to keep himself upright.  
  
¬† Pow!  
  
¬† Two. Khalil gasps.  
  
¬† Pow!  
  
¬† Three. Khalil looks at me, stunned.  
  
¬† He falls to the ground.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm ten again, watching Natasha drop.  
  
¬† An earsplitting scream emerges from my gut, explodes in my throat, and uses every inch of me to be heard.  
  
¬† Instinct says don‚Äôt move, but everything else says check on Khalil. I jump out the Impala and rush around to the other side. Khalil stares at the sky as if he hopes to see God. His mouth is open like he wants to scream. I scream loud enough for the both of us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù is all I can say, like I‚Äôm a year old and it‚Äôs the only word I know. I‚Äôm not sure how I end up on the ground next to him. My mom once said that if someone gets shot, try to stop the bleeding, but there‚Äôs so much blood. Too much blood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, no, no.‚Äù  
  
¬† Khalil doesn‚Äôt move. He doesn‚Äôt utter a word. He doesn‚Äôt even look at me. His body stiffens, and he‚Äôs gone. I hope he sees God.  
  
¬† Someone else screams.  
  
¬† I blink through my tears. Officer One-Fifteen yells at me, pointing the same gun he killed my friend with.  
  
¬† I put my hands up.  
  
¬† THREE  
  
¬† They leave Khalil‚Äôs body in the street like it‚Äôs an exhibit. Police cars and ambulances flash all along Carnation Street. People stand off to the side, trying to see what happened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn, bruh,‚Äù some guy says. ‚ÄúThey killed him!‚Äù  
  
¬† The police tell the crowd to leave. Nobody listens.  
  
¬† The paramedics can‚Äôt do shit for Khalil, so they put me in the back of an ambulance like I need help. The bright lights spotlight me, and people crane their necks to get a peek.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt feel special. I feel sick.  
  
¬† The cops rummage through Khalil‚Äôs car. I try to tell them to stop. Please, cover his body. Please, close his eyes. Please, close his mouth. Get away from his car. Don‚Äôt pick up his hairbrush. But the words never come out.  
  
¬† One-Fifteen sits on the sidewalk with his face buried in his hands. Other officers pat his shoulder and tell him it‚Äôll be okay.  
  
¬† They finally put a sheet over Khalil. He can‚Äôt breathe under it. I can‚Äôt breathe.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Breathe.  
  
¬† I gasp.  
  
¬† And gasp.  
  
¬† And gasp.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStarr?‚Äù  
  
¬† Brown eyes with long eyelashes appear in front of me. They‚Äôre like mine.  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt say much to the cops, but I did manage to give them my parents‚Äô names and phone numbers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Daddy says. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù  
  
¬† I open my mouth to respond. A sob comes out.  
  
¬† Daddy is moved aside, and Momma wraps her arms around me. She rubs my back and speaks in hushed tones that tell lies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, baby. It‚Äôs all right.‚Äù  
  
¬† We stay this way for a long time. Eventually, Daddy helps us out the ambulance. He wraps his arm around me like a shield against curious eyes and guides me to his Tahoe down the street.  
  
¬† He drives. A streetlight flashes across his face, revealing how tight his jaw is set. His veins bulge along his bald head.  
  
¬† Momma‚Äôs wearing her scrubs, the ones with the rubber ducks on them. She did an extra shift at the emergency room tonight. She wipes her eyes a few times, probably thinking about Khalil or how that could‚Äôve been me lying in the street.  
  
¬† My stomach twists. All of that blood, and it came out of him. Some of it is on my hands, on Seven‚Äôs hoodie, on my sneakers. An hour ago we were laughing and catching up. Now his blood . . .  
  
¬† Hot spit pools in my mouth. My stomach twists tighter. I gag.  
  
¬† Momma glances at me in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúMaverick, pull over!‚Äù  
  
¬† I throw myself across the backseat and push the door open before the truck comes to a complete stop. It feels like everything in me is coming out, and all I can do is let it.  
  
¬† Momma hops out and runs around to me. She holds my hair out the way and rubs my back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, baby,‚Äù she says.  
  
¬† When we get home, she helps me undress. Seven‚Äôs hoodie and my Jordans disappear into a black trash bag, and I never see them again.  
  
¬† I sit in a tub of steaming water and scrub my hands raw to get Khalil‚Äôs blood off. Daddy carries me to bed, and Momma brushes her fingers through my hair until I fall asleep.  
  
¬† Nightmares wake me over and over again. Momma reminds me to breathe, the same way she did before I outgrew asthma. I think she stays in my room the whole night, ‚Äôcause every time I wake up, she‚Äôs sitting on my bed.  
  
¬† But this time, she‚Äôs gone. My eyes strain against the brightness of my neon-blue walls. The clock says it‚Äôs five in the morning. My body‚Äôs so used to waking up at five, it doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs Saturday morning or not.  
  
¬† I stare at the glow-in-the-dark stars on my ceiling, trying to recap the night before. The party flashes in my mind, the fight, One-Fifteen pulling me and Khalil over. The first shot rings in my ears. The second. The third.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm lying in bed. Khalil is lying in the county morgue.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs where Natasha ended up too. It happened six years ago, but I  
still remember everything from that day. I was sweeping floors at our grocery store, saving up for my first pair of J‚Äôs, when Natasha ran in. She was chunky (her momma told her it was baby fat), dark-skinned, and wore her hair in braids that always looked freshly done. I wanted braids like hers so bad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStarr, the hydrant on Elm Street busted!‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† That was like saying we had a free water park. I remember looking at Daddy and pleading silently. He said I could go, as long as I promised to be back in an hour.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt think I ever saw the water shoot as high as it did that day. Almost everybody in the neighborhood was there too. Just having fun. I was the only one who noticed the car at first.  
  
¬† A tattooed arm stretched out the back window, holding a Glock. People ran. Not me though. My feet became part of the sidewalk. Natasha was splashing in the water, all happy and stuff. Then‚Äî  
  
¬† Pow! Pow! Pow!  
  
¬† I dove into a rosebush. By the time I got up, somebody was yelling, ‚ÄúCall nine-one-one!‚Äù At first I thought it was me, ‚Äôcause I had blood on my shirt. The thorns on the rosebush got me, that‚Äôs all. It was Natasha though. Her blood mixed in with the water, and all you could see was a red river flowing down the street.  
  
¬† She looked scared. We were ten, we didn‚Äôt know what happened after you died. Hell, I still don‚Äôt know, and she was forced to find out, even if she didn‚Äôt wanna find out.  
  
¬† I know she didn‚Äôt. Just like Khalil didn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† My door creaks open, and Momma peeks in. She tries to smile. ‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs up.‚Äù  
  
¬† She sinks onto her spot on the bed and touches my forehead, even though I don‚Äôt have a fever. She takes care of sick kids so much that it‚Äôs her first instinct. ‚ÄúHow you feeling, Munch?‚Äù  
  
¬† That nickname. My parents claim I was always munching on something from the moment I got off the bottle. I‚Äôve lost my big appetite, but I can‚Äôt lose that nickname. ‚ÄúTired,‚Äù I say. My voice has extra bass in it. ‚ÄúI wanna stay in bed.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know, baby, but I don‚Äôt want you here by yourself.‚Äù  
  
¬† That‚Äôs all I wanna be, by myself. She stares at me, but it feels like she‚Äôs looking at who I used to be, her little girl with ponytails and a snaggletooth who swore she was a Powerpuff Girl. It‚Äôs weird but also kinda like a blanket I wanna get wrapped up in.‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she says.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù  
  
¬† She stands and holds her hand out. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon. Let‚Äôs get you something to eat.‚Äù  
  
¬† We walk slowly to the kitchen. Black Jesus hangs from the cross in a painting on the hallway wall, and Malcolm X holds a shotgun in a photograph next to him. Nana still complains about those pictures hanging next to each other.  
  
¬† We live in her old house. She gave it to my parents after my uncle, Carlos, moved her into his humongous house in the suburbs. Uncle Carlos was always uneasy about Nana living by herself in Garden Heights, especially since break-ins and robberies seem to happen more to older folks than anybody. Nana doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs old though. She refused to leave, talking about how it was her home and no thugs were gonna run her out, not even when somebody broke in and stole her television. About a month after that, Uncle Carlos claimed that he and Aunt Pam needed her help with their kids. Since, according to Nana, Aunt Pam ‚Äúcan‚Äôt cook worth a damn for those poor babies‚Äù she finally agreed to move. Our house hasn‚Äôt lost its Nana-ness though, with its permanent odor of potpourri, flowered wallpaper, and hints of pink in almost every room.  
  
¬† Daddy and Seven are talking before we get to the kitchen. They go silent as soon as we walk in.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMorning, baby girl.‚Äù Daddy gets up from the table and kisses my forehead. ‚ÄúYou sleep okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I lie as he guides me to a seat. Seven just stares.  
  
¬† Momma opens the fridge, the door crowded with takeout menus and fruit-shaped magnets. ‚ÄúAll right, Munch,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúyou want turkey bacon or regular?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRegular.‚Äù I‚Äôm surprised I have an option. We never have pork. We aren‚Äôt Muslims. More like ‚ÄúChristlims.‚Äù Momma became a member of Christ Temple Church when she was in Nana‚Äôs belly. Daddy believes in Black Jesus but follows the Black Panthers‚Äô Ten-Point Program more than the Ten Commandments. He agrees with the Nation of Islam on some stuff, but he can‚Äôt get over the fact that they may have killed Malcolm X.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPig in my house,‚Äù Daddy grumbles and sits next to me. Seven smirks across from him. Seven and Daddy look like one of those age-progression pictures they show when somebody‚Äôs been missing a long time. Throw my little brother, Sekani, in there and you have the same person at eight, seventeen, and thirty-six. They‚Äôre dark brown, slender, and have thick eyebrows and long eyelashes that almost look feminine. Seven‚Äôs dreads are long enough to give both bald-headed Daddy and short-haired Sekani each a head full of hair.  
  
¬† As for me, it‚Äôs as if God mixed my parents‚Äô skin tones in a paint bucket to get my medium-brown complexion. I did inherit Daddy‚Äôs eyelashes‚Äîand I‚Äôm cursed with his eyebrows too. Otherwise I‚Äôm mostly my mom, with big brown eyes and a little too much forehead.  
  
¬† Momma passes behind Seven with the bacon and squeezes his shoulder. ‚ÄúThank you for staying with your brother last night so we could‚Äî‚Äù Her voice catches, but the reminder of what happened hangs in the air. She clears her throat. ‚ÄúWe appreciate it.

**Verse 1**  
The sunset fades on this empty seat,  
Where echoes of laughter feel so bittersweet.  
I stroll through memories, where we used to roam,  
Now it‚Äôs just shadows, and I‚Äôm all alone.  

**Chorus**  
I can‚Äôt stand not having you,  
Like the stars can‚Äôt shine without the moon.  
Every moment feels so wrong,  
Without you here, where do I belong?  
I can‚Äôt stand not having you,  
You‚Äôre the melody in my heart‚Äôs old tune.  
In every whisper of the wind that blows,  
I see your smile in the evening glow.  

**Verse 2**  
The coffee‚Äôs cold in this little caf√©,  
Where we‚Äôd share secrets and laugh the day away.  
Your chair‚Äôs still empty, but I hold on tight,  
To the love we built in the soft moonlight.  

**Chorus**  
I can‚Äôt stand not having you,  
Like the stars can‚Äôt shine without the moon.  
Every moment feels so wrong,  
Without you here, where do I belong?  
I can‚Äôt stand not having you,  
You‚Äôre the melody in my heart‚Äôs old tune.  
In every whisper of the wind that blows,  
I see your smile in the evening glow.  

**Bridge**  
Every road leads me back to you,  
In dreams we‚Äôre dancing, in colors so true.  
But when I wake, it‚Äôs just another day,  
In this quiet world, I wish you‚Äôd stay.  

**Chorus**  
I can‚Äôt stand not having you,  
Like the stars can‚Äôt shine without the moon.  
Every moment feels so wrong,  
Without you here, where do I belong?  
I can‚Äôt stand not having you,  
You‚Äôre the melody in my heart‚Äôs old tune.  
In every whisper of the wind that blows,  
I see your smile in the evening glow.

**Outro**  
So here I‚Äôll wait on this winding road,  
Counting the days till I don‚Äôt feel so alone.  
Until we meet, my heart will stay true,  
Oh, I can‚Äôt stand not having you.

¬† Alex nodded as he put a Big Gulp coffee down in front of her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCool,‚Äù breathed the girl, gazing out at the car. It was a Porsche Carrera, and the sunshine was glistening off it like liquid onyx. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see cars like that around here very often. ‚Äù  
  
¬† No, I bet you don‚Äôt, thought Alex, trying to remember where here was. Cattle Chute, Oklahoma, or some such dismal place. HOME OF THE ROOTIN‚Äô-TOOTIN‚Äô COWBOYS! the bullet-ridden sign outside of town had proclaimed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPump three,‚Äù he told her.  
  
¬† The girl smiled at him, widening her brown eyes as she rang up his coffee and the gas. ‚ÄúSo, are you new in town?‚Äù she asked. VICKY, said her name tag. She was almost as tall as he was ‚Äî which wasn‚Äôt that tall; he was just over five eleven ‚Äî and her brown hair had been ironed so straight that you could get a paper cut from it.  
  
¬† After-school job, he thought, pulling out his wallet. Sixteen or so. She probably goes to that giant high school that I passed just outside of town.  
  
¬† The thought irritated and amused him in equal measure. He had only seen high school on TV: jocks in their letterman jackets, cheerleaders jumping around the field, couples hanging on to each other at the senior prom. It was another world, one so stupidly innocent that it was frightening. High-school students were old enough to be fighting, but none of them were doing it.  
  
¬† Because hardly anyone actually knew that there was a war on.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, just passing through,‚Äù he said. He handed her a couple of twenties.  
  
¬† Vicky‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúOh. I was just wondering if you‚Äôd be going to our high school . . . but I guess you‚Äôre sort of old for that. What are you ‚Äî twenty-one or something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOr something,‚Äù he said with a slight grin. He was actually seventeen, but she was right in a way. In all the ways that mattered, he was old.  
  
¬† She took her time getting his change. ‚ÄúHow long are you here for? Because, you know ‚Äî if you‚Äôre looking for something to do or maybe someone to show you around ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a beeping sound from his jeans pocket as his cell phone announced a text. Alex‚Äôs heart leaped. Turning away slightly, he pulled the phone out and flipped it open.  
  
¬† ENEMY SIGHTED, ASPEN, CO, RESIDENCE, 1124 TYLER ST.  
  
¬† Yes! Immediately, Alex felt the fierce buzz sweep over him that he always got when there‚Äôd been a sighting. Christ, finally ‚Äî it had been over a week; he‚Äôd been going insane. Putting his phone back in his pocket, he smiled at Vicky. Why not? He‚Äôd never see her again, anyway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe next time,‚Äù he said, picking up his coffee. ‚ÄúThanks, though. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù she said, trying to smile back. ‚ÄúWell . . . have a good trip. ‚Äù  
  
¬† As Alex pushed open the swinging door, the too-cold air-conditioning abruptly gave way to a flat, burning September. He slid into the Porsche. It was low to the ground, and its black leather seats wrapped around him in a dark embrace. It was comfortable as hell, actually, which was good, since he practically lived in it. ASPEN, CO, he punched into the GPS. Estimated time of arrival, 2:47 a. m. Almost nine hours. He‚Äôd drive straight through, he decided, taking a gulp of coffee. He didn‚Äôt need sleep ‚Äî God, that was all he‚Äôd been doing since his last assignment.  
  
¬† Pulling out of the parking lot, Alex turned onto Highway 34 and headed north out of town. If you could call it a town: there were a few dozen grids of streets with clapboard houses and a couple of long, brightly lit strip malls, where the rootin‚Äô-tootin‚Äô teenagers probably cruised up and down on Saturday night, drinking Bud Lights and shouting at each other. Just outside the town limits, it all ended and became dust and grain silos and oil pumps. Setting the cruise control to seventy, Alex turned on the radio. The Eagles came on, warbling about the Hotel California, and he grimaced. Switching to his iPod instead, he put on some neoclassical as the Porsche began to smoothly eat the miles.  
  
¬† And, briefly, he wondered what Vicky would think if she knew he had a semiautomatic rifle in his trunk.  
  
¬† The Rocky Mountains cradled Aspen deep within them, like a giant‚Äôs palm lightly cupping a handful of diamonds. The road twisted and turned down the mountain as Alex approached the city, his headlights sweeping the dark asphalt in front of him. Startled rabbits froze on the side of the road, their eyes wide, and once he disturbed a buck, sending it crashing and leaping into the woods.  
  
¬† His car clock read 2:51 as he crossed into the Aspen city limits. Not bad. The GPS directed him to Tyler Street, a quiet, tree-lined avenue not far from downtown. One of the streetlights was flickering; the rest glowed silently, showing a row of houses with large bay windows and immaculate front lawns. No house lights were on. Everyone was asleep.  
  
¬† Alex parked his car a few doors down from number 1124. Propping his elbows against the steering wheel, he surveyed the house, his dark eyebrows drawn together thoughtfully. Sometimes you could see a sign of them if you knew what to look for, but there was nothing here. It was just an ordinary house, though the front lawn wasn‚Äôt quite as pristine as the others. A few weeds grew here and there, spiking rebelliously up through the grass.  
  
¬† Letting down the neighborhood ‚Äî tsk, tsk, thought Alex.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd transferred his rifle to the front seat before he began the descent into Aspen, and now he clicked the magazine into place and sighted along the rifle‚Äôs length, squinting through the infrared lens at the house. The front door snapped into an eerie reddish focus. He could even read the name on the wrought-iron mailbox that was affixed to the front porch wall: T. GOODMAN.  
  
¬† Goodman. Alex snorted despite himself. The creatures often took human last names to help them blend in; nice to see that some of them had a sense of humor. He screwed the silencer onto the rifle‚Äôs muzzle. It was state of the art, as sleek and gleaming as the rifle itself. Now all he had to do was wait. He settled back in his seat, gazing at the house. Back in the days when they‚Äôd gone out in teams, the other AKs had always hated stakeouts, but they were part of the hunt to Alex. Part of the buzz. Your senses had to be on alert; you couldn‚Äôt relax for a moment.  
  
¬† Almost an hour later, the front door opened. He had the rifle in place in less than a second, watching carefully through the lens. The tall man on the front porch paused to lock the door, then jogged briskly down the steps and strode off down the street, his footsteps echoing with purpose.  
  
¬† Alex lowered the rifle, unsurprised that T. Goodman was in his human form ‚Äî they normally showed their true nature only when they were feeding. He waited until Goodman had turned the corner, heading toward downtown. Then he got out of his car and softly opened the trunk. He pulled on a black trench coat, eased the trunk closed again and set off, the rifle hidden safely beneath the coat‚Äôs long folds.  
  
¬† As he turned the corner, he could see his quarry about a block away, crossing the street. He slowed, letting his gaze drift out of focus. An aura swam into view around the dark figure: pale silver, with a faint blue light flickering feebly at its edges.  
  
¬† Alex quickened his step. The creature hadn‚Äôt fed in days ‚Äî which meant that he must be on the hunt now.  
  
¬† Sure enough, the man led him to a bar downtown. SPURS, flashed the sign in front. A yellow-and-pink neon figure of a cowgirl wearing shorts and a tiny leather vest flashed on and off, waving her hat. There was the heavy pulse of music and a chorus of raucous male cheers.  


Recognizing the sign, Alex shook his head in grudging admiration. Spurs was one of those places where the female wait staff wore sexy clothes and danced on the bar. The men staggering out at this hour would be drunk and rowdy, not paying much attention to their surroundings ‚Äî ideal if you were on the hunt. It was just the sort of place that he‚Äôd have chosen himself, in fact.  
  
¬† A pair of bored-looking bouncers flanked the front door. T. Goodman melted into the shadows nearby, attracting no attention from either of them. Half a street away, Alex took up a position behind a parked Subaru, mentally calculating the fallout distance. He‚Äôd be fine, he decided; he‚Äôd gone for much closer than this in his time. The bouncers might catch some flak, though.  
  
¬† Just then the heavy metal door to Spurs swung open, and a man wearing a disheveled business suit stumbled out. ‚ÄúExcellent night, my man,‚Äù he said, slapping one of the bouncers on the shoulder. ‚ÄúThose ladies are goo-od. ‚Äù He shook his head in wonder, as if the power to describe just how good was beyond him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre real hot,‚Äù said the bouncer, looking amused.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not planning on driving, Eddie,‚Äù said the other one. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let us call you a cab?‚Äù  
  
¬† Eddie made no reply. He wove off down the street, humming tunelessly to himself. One of his stumbling feet caught an empty beer can, and the sound of it echoed through the night. The bouncers glanced at each other and shrugged. Not their problem.  
  
¬† Alex straightened as T. Goodman detached himself from the gloom and trailed off after the man, a tall, silent shadow. With the rifle propped firmly against his shoulder, Alex began to track him. It would be any second now; he was sure of it. They didn‚Äôt need privacy, just a relatively clear field. Not taking his eyes off Goodman, Alex drew a deep breath to center himself and then swiftly moved the focus of his energy up through his chakra points until it hovered somewhere above his crown.  
  
¬† Immediately, he felt a slight shudder pass through him as the creature locked minds with its prey. He had been right ‚Äî this was it. Wavering, Eddie stopped in his tracks, looking uncertain. Slowly, he turned around.  
  
¬† With a dark ripple, Goodman‚Äôs human body melted away. A blinding, glorious light grew in its place until it was like a beacon that shone up and down the street, illuminating everything ‚Äî the bar, the other buildings, Eddie‚Äôs small, frightened face. And at the center of the light was a glowing being seven feet tall, whose giant, spreading wings were such a pure white that they looked almost blue.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù breathed Eddie as the angel drew toward him.  
  
¬† Half a street away, Alex could hear the bouncers laughing with a woman who‚Äôd stopped to ask them for a light. If any of them glanced this way, all they‚Äôd see would be Eddie standing on his own, wobbling drunkenly on the dark street.  
  
¬† Leaning over the top of the car, Alex squinted through the lens, his hands cool and steady as he aimed the rifle. The angel‚Äôs face came into focus, magnified several times. As a human, Goodman was as physically attractive as all angels, though Alex knew that if he‚Äôd gotten a good look at his face, it would have seemed slightly weird ‚Äî too intense, with eyes maybe a shade too dark for comfort. But now, in his ethereal form, Goodman‚Äôs features had an almost otherworldly beauty: proud, fierce. The halo that framed them radiated like holy fire.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid,‚Äù soothed the angel in a voice that was a hundred chiming bells. ‚ÄúI am here for a reason. I need to give you something. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Eddie dropped to his knees, eyes bulging. ‚ÄúI ‚Äî I ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† The halo. Alex sighted on it, aiming for the deep, pure white at its heart.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt hurt,‚Äù continued the angel, drawing closer. It smiled then, and its radiance increased tenfold, burning the night. Trembling, Eddie moaned and ducked his head, unable to bear the beauty of it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn fact, you‚Äôll remember this as the most meaningful experience of your life ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex pulled the trigger. As the pulsing energy of the angel‚Äôs halo was disrupted by the force of the bullet, the creature burst, without a sound, into a million shooting fragments of light. Alex ducked behind the car as a shock wave slammed past him, the angel‚Äôs scream of anguish echoing in his ears. Still in his enhanced state, he could see the energy fields of every living thing nearby affected by the aftershock: the ghostly outline of a tree, of a few stray blades of grass ‚Äî all of them dancing and warping as if buffeted by a hurricane.  
  
¬† Slowly, everything returned to normal. There was silence. Alex brought his energy focus back to his heart chakra, and the ghostly outlines disappeared. He shoved his rifle under the car for the moment, then walked over to Eddie, who still knelt, trembling, on the sidewalk. T. Goodman was gone, with no sign of him left.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, man, you OK?‚Äù said Alex easily, crouching beside Eddie. The bouncers had stopped talking and were looking in their direction. Alex raised a casual hand to them. Everything‚Äôs fine. Dude‚Äôs just a bit drunk is all.  
  
¬† Eddie turned a tearstained face toward him. He swallowed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI ‚Äî there was ‚Äî I know you won‚Äôt believe me, but ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I know,‚Äù said Alex. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs get you up. ‚Äù He put an arm around Eddie and helped him to his feet. Jesus, the guy could try dieting a little.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, God . . . I‚Äôve got such a headache,‚Äù moaned Eddie, leaning limply against Alex‚Äôs shoulder. Angel fallout, thought Alex. Eddie had only been a few feet away, and though most of it had blasted straight back at Alex, he‚Äôd still feel the effects for days. It was better than angel burn, though.  
  
¬† Anything was better than that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was so beautiful,‚Äù mumbled Eddie, his head lolling limply. ‚ÄúSo goddamn beautiful. . . . ‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, real beautiful,‚Äù he muttered. He started walking back toward the bar with Eddie shuffling along beside him. As usual, he felt the mix of pity and contempt that he always felt for civilians. Though he spent his life trying to save them, they were all so clueless that he didn‚Äôt get much pleasure from it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, I think our friend here needs a cab,‚Äù he said when he reached the bouncers. ‚ÄúFound him passed out on the sidewalk over there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† One of the bouncers chuckled. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôll take care of it,‚Äù he said, taking the businessman‚Äôs weight from Alex. ‚ÄúOld Eddie‚Äôs a regular here, aren‚Äôt you, buddy?‚Äù  
  
¬† Eddie rolled his head, struggling to focus. ‚ÄúTom . . . I saw an angel,‚Äù he slurred.  
  
¬† The bouncers burst out laughing. ‚ÄúYeah, you mean Amber, right?‚Äù said the other one. ‚ÄúShe wears those really short shorts while she‚Äôs dancing around on the bar. ‚Äù He winked at Alex. ‚ÄúHey, you wanna go in? No cover charge; our treat. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex had been in plenty of places like this in his time, mostly dragged along by the other AKs when he was younger. He thought they were boring as hell, to be honest. And though a drink sounded good, the thought of sitting in a Spurs with his adrenaline still pumping from the kill was a little too surreal, even for him.  
  
¬† He shook his head, taking a step backward. ‚ÄúNah, maybe next time. I‚Äôd better get going. Thanks, though. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnytime,‚Äù said the first bouncer. Eddie had passed out for real by then, slumped against the man‚Äôs broad shoulder like a sack of potatoes. The bouncer shifted his bulk impatiently. ‚ÄúHey, Mike, you gonna call that cab company, or what? Sleeping Beauty here is fading fast. ‚Äù  
Yeah, tell him to lay off the hard stuff,‚Äù said Alex with a grin. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be seeing pink elephants next. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTHIS IS SO EMBARRASSING,‚Äù muttered Nina. She was leaning against the driver‚Äôs-side door with her arms crossed over her chest, shaking her head in disapproval.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you want it fixed or not?‚Äù I demanded. My voice came out muffled, because my head was buried somewhere deep in her Corvette‚Äôs engine, along with most of my upper body. I was trying to replace her carburetor, but her engine was so filthy that the nuts were practically welded in place with gasket grime ‚Äî which is black and gross, in case you‚Äôre wondering.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWould you hand me that wrench? The one with the yellow handle?‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina grumbled to herself as she crouched down to rummage through my tools. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you actually have a toolbox. I can‚Äôt believe you brought it to school with you. ‚Äù She shoved the wrench into my hand.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine ‚Äî should I stop? Just say the word. ‚Äù I‚Äôd already removed her air filter by then and disconnected the fuel line and vacuum hoses. We were in the school parking lot because I had figured it would be easier doing it there than in my garage at home, which is stuffed to the gills with old boxes and bicycles and crap that my aunt keeps meaning to throw out but hasn‚Äôt gotten around to yet. I had clearly reckoned without the embarrassment factor, though. Story of my life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWillow! Don‚Äôt you dare,‚Äù hissed Nina, pulling at her brown bangs. ‚ÄúLook, don‚Äôt get all sensitive. Yes, I want it fixed; I just didn‚Äôt know that you were going to do it here ‚Äî that‚Äôs all. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She glanced furtively over her shoulder at the playing field, obviously keeping an eye out for Scott Mason and his gang of swaggering football heroes. The school day was long over with, but football practice was still going strong. Meanwhile, the student parking lot was like an empty gray ocean around us, with only a few stray cars dotted about here and there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust be thankful I didn‚Äôt do it at lunchtime,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI do have some sense of decorum, you know. Oh, come on, you ‚Äî‚Äù I gritted my teeth as I struggled to turn the wrench, putting all of my weight on it. All at once the nut gave way. ‚ÄúHa! Success. ‚Äù I spun it free, then pulled the old carburetor out and checked it against the new one. Perfect match. Which was sort of a miracle, given that Nina‚Äôs Corvette practically belonged in the Smithsonian.  
  
¬† Nina wrinkled her nose. ‚ÄúDecorum? You? Don‚Äôt make me laugh. Like, what are you wearing?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúClothes?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWillow. You look like . . . I don‚Äôt know; I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs even a word for it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally? Cool. ‚Äù I grinned as I wiped my hands off on a piece of wadding. ‚ÄúThat means I‚Äôm unique, right?‚Äù Despite the chill in the air, I was wearing a short-sleeved 1950s brocade blouse with my favorite pair of battered jeans. My black velvet jacket was draped over Nina‚Äôs open hood, out of harm‚Äôs way. I‚Äôd bought most of it at Tammy‚Äôs Attic, which has to be my favorite store ever.  
  
¬† Nina closed her eyes and groaned. ‚ÄúUnique. Yes, you could say that. Oh, my God, Pawtucket is so not ready for you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† This was so true that it wasn‚Äôt even worth debating. Instead I took a screwdriver and started to scrape clean the area where the old carburetor had been, getting rid of all the old dirt and gasket material. Beyond gross. Picture a coal pit that‚Äôs fallen into an oil slick.  
  
¬† Nina opened her eyes and peered under the hood. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing now?‚Äù she asked warily.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGetting rid all of your disgusting grime. ‚Äù I showed her the wrench, which was now thick with black goo. ‚ÄúWant to help?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEww, no. ‚Äù She sighed and leaned against the side of the car again, twiddling a piece of hair around her finger. ‚ÄúAnyway, what do you have to clean it for? Can‚Äôt you just shove the new one in?‚Äù  
  
¬† A strand of my long blond hair fell down as I was working, and I tucked it back behind my ear without looking up. ‚ÄúGood idea. Then it wouldn‚Äôt have a perfect seal, so it would start sucking in air like a dying vacuum cleaner, and ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina straightened up again with a jolt. ‚ÄúOh, my God! Here comes Beth Hartley!‚Äù  
  
¬† Beth Hartley was one of the stars of Pawtucket High ‚Äî slim, beautiful, good grades, et cetera. She was a year older than us, almost eighteen, and a senior. Even apart from that, we didn‚Äôt exactly move in the same circles. She was on every club and committee there was and basically lived at school. In fact, I think they‚Äôd shut the place down if she ever couldn‚Äôt come in for some reason. The teachers would all go on strike.  
  
¬† I poured some solvent onto a clean rag and started swabbing it around the empty space where the carburetor had been. ‚ÄúWhat was it today, do you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCheerleading? Prom committee? Saving the world?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWillow, this isn‚Äôt funny,‚Äù moaned Nina. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs heading right toward us!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo? I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs seen a carburetor before. ‚Äù Nina stared at me. There was a beat, and then I realized what I‚Äôd said and started laughing. ‚ÄúOh. Maybe not, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina huffed out a breath, looking like she couldn‚Äôt decide whether to throttle me or join in laughing. ‚ÄúLook, I know you don‚Äôt care, but most people already think you‚Äôre Queen Weird, you know. This is not going to help matters, believe me ‚Äî‚Äù She fell abruptly silent as Beth walked up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù said Beth, looking uncertainly from Nina to me. She had long, honey-colored hair and makeup that was always so subtle and perfect that you could barely tell she had it on. Which had always seemed sort of a waste of time to me ‚Äî spending hours putting on makeup that looked invisible once you were done ‚Äî but there you go.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said back, poking my head out from underneath the hood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi, Beth,‚Äù said Nina faintly. ‚ÄúGood drama club meeting?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYearbook,‚Äù corrected Beth. ‚ÄúYeah, great. ‚Äù She was staring at the open hood and me under it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre . . . fixing Nina‚Äôs car,‚Äù she said. It was halfway between a question and a statement.  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúHer carburetor. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCarburetor. Right,‚Äù echoed Beth, blinking her wide brown eyes.  
  
¬† There was a pause. I could see Beth mentally shaking her head to clear it and then deciding that, actually, she didn‚Äôt really want to pursue the carburetor thing. She cleared her throat. ‚ÄúWillow, I just wondered whether you had the homework assignment for Atkinson‚Äôs class. I wasn‚Äôt there yesterday. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt my eyebrows fly up. I hadn‚Äôt realized that Beth even knew we were in the same class. Or in the same school. Or on the same planet. On second thought, scratch that ‚Äî we probably weren‚Äôt on the same planet. And why was she asking me, anyway? A dozen of her perfect friends were in that class.  
  
¬† I shrugged. ‚ÄúYeah, sure ‚Äî it‚Äôs in my red folder. ‚Äù I motioned toward my schoolbag, which was sitting beside the open toolbox on the ground. ‚ÄúWould you mind? My hands are all ‚Äî‚Äù I held them up to show her, and she blanched.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat, thanks. ‚Äù She slipped the folder out of my bag and quickly scribbled down the assignment. As she put the folder back, she glanced at Nina and hesitated. She started to say something and stopped. Her neck turned bright pink.

**Size and Dimensions**

A well-constructed frame is crucial for an ottoman's long-term durability. Look for solid wood frames,ideally made from hardwoods like oak or maple.Reinforced joints and sturdy legs ensure the ottoman can withstand regular use without wobbling or breaking. Check the weight capacity to ensure it meets your needs. A well-constructed ottoman should feel solid and stable, not flimsy or lightweight.

I had no home. I couldn‚Äôt go back to Granny Q‚Äôs. She was Cain‚Äôs grandmother. He was probably there waiting on me. Or maybe he wasn‚Äôt. Maybe I‚Äôd pushed him away too. I sat down at the foot of my mother‚Äôs grave.I pulled my knees up under my chin and wrapped my arms around my legs.  
  
¬† I had come back to Sumit because it was the only place I knew to come. Now, I needed to leave. I couldn‚Äôt stay here. Once again my life was about to take a sudden turn. One I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. When I‚Äôd been a little girl my momma had taken us to Sunday school at the local Baptist church. I remembered a scripture they read us from the Bible about God not putting more on us than we could bear. I was beginning to wonder if that was just for those people who went to church every Sunday and prayed before they went to bed at night. Because he wasn‚Äôt holding back any punches with me.  
  
¬† Feeling sorry for myself didn‚Äôt help me. I couldn‚Äôt do that. I had to figure this one out too. My staying with Granny Q and letting Cain help me deal with day to day life had only been temporary. I knew when I moved into her guest bedroom that I couldn‚Äôt stay long. There was too much history between Cain and me. History I didn‚Äôt intend to repeat. The time to leave was here but I was still just as clueless about where I was gonna go and what I was gonna do as I had been three weeks ago.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish you were here, Momma. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt have anyone to ask,‚Äù I whispered as I sat there in the quiet cemetery. I wanted to believe she could hear me. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of her being under the ground but after my twin sister, Valerie, had died I‚Äôd sat here in this spot with my mom and we‚Äôd talked to Valerie. Momma had said her spirit was watching out for us and she could hear us. I so wanted to believe that now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just me. I miss y‚Äôall. I don‚Äôt want to be alone‚Ä¶ but I am. And I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù The only sound was the wind rustling the leaves in the trees. ‚ÄúYou once told me if I listened real hard I‚Äôd know the answer in my heart. I‚Äôm listening Momma, but I am so confused. Maybe you could help me out by pointing me in the right direction somehow?‚Äù  
  
¬† I rested my chin on my knees and closed my eyes, refusing to cry.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRemember when you said I needed to tell Cain exactly how I felt. That I wouldn‚Äôt feel better until I had it all out. Well, I did just that today. Even if he does forgive me it‚Äôll never be the same. I can‚Äôt keep relying on him for things anyway. It‚Äôs time I figure this out on my own. I just don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù  
  
¬† Just asking her made me feel better. Knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get an answer didn‚Äôt seem to matter.  
  
¬† A car door slammed breaking the peacefulness and I dropped my arms from my legs and turned to look back at the parking lot to see a car too expensive for this little town. Turning my eyes to see who had stepped out of it I gasped then jumped up. It was Bethy. She was here. In [Sumit.In](http://Sumit.In) the cemetery‚Ä¶ driving a very, very expensive looking car.  
  
¬† Her long brown hair was pulled over her shoulder in a ponytail. There was a smile tugging on her lips as my eyes met hers. I couldn‚Äôt move. I was afraid I was imagining things. What was Bethy doing here?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou not having a cell phone is for the birds. How the hell am I supposed to call you and tell you I‚Äôm coming to get your ass if I have no number to call? Hmmm?‚Äù Her words made no sense but just hearing her voice sent me running the short distance between us.  
  
¬† Bethy laughed and opened her arms as I flung myself into them. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre here,‚Äù I said after hugging her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, well, me either. That was one long drive. But you‚Äôre worth it and seeing as you left the cell phone in Rosemary I had no way to talk to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wanted to tell her everything but I couldn‚Äôt. Not yet. I needed time. She knew about my dad already. She knew about Nan. But the rest‚Ä¶ I knew she didn‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre here but how did you find me?‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy grinned and tilted her head to the side. ‚ÄúI drove through town looking for your truck. It wasn‚Äôt that hard. This place has like one red light. If I had blinked twice I‚Äôd have missed it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat car probably caught some attention coming through town,‚Äù I said glancing over at it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jace‚Äôs. That thing rides like a dream.‚Äù  
  
¬† She was still with Jace. Good. But my chest ached. Jace reminded me of Rosemary. And Rosemary reminded me of Rush.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd ask you how you are but girl, you look like a walking stick figure. Have you had food since you left Rosemary?‚Äù  
  
¬† My clothes were all falling off me. Eating had been difficult with the large knot that stayed tight in my chest at all times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a rough few weeks but I think I‚Äôm getting better. Moving on from things. Dealing with it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy shifted her gaze to the grave behind me. Both of them. I could see the sadness in her eyes as she read both the headstones. ‚ÄúNo one can take away your memories. You have those,‚Äù she said squeezing my hand in hers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know. I don‚Äôt believe them. My father is a liar. I don‚Äôt believe any of them. She, my mother, she wouldn‚Äôt have done what they claim. If anyone is to blame it is my father. He caused this pain. Not my momma. Never my momma.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy nodded and held my hand firmly in hers. Just having someone listen to me and know they believed me, that they believed my mother‚Äôs innocence helped.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid your sister look a lot like you?‚Äù  
  
¬† The last memory I had of Valerie was of her smiling. That bright smile that was so much prettier than mine. Her teeth were perfect without the help of braces. Her eyes were brighter than mine. But everyone said we were identical. They didn‚Äôt see the difference. I always wondered why. I could see it so clearly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe were identical,‚Äù I replied. Bethy wouldn‚Äôt understand the truth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine two Blaire Wynns. Y‚Äôall must have broken hearts all over this little town.‚Äù She was trying to lighten the mood after asking about my deceased sister. I appreciated it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust Valerie. I was with Cain from the time I was young. I didn‚Äôt break any hearts.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy‚Äôs eyes went a little wide then she glanced away before clearing her throat. I waited until she turned back to me. ‚ÄúAlthough seeing you is awesome and we could totally rock this town, I‚Äôm actually here for a purpose.‚Äù  
  
¬† I assumed she was I just couldn‚Äôt figure out what that purpose was exactly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said waiting for more of an explanation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan we talk about this over a coffee?‚Äù She frowned then glanced back at the street. ‚ÄúOr maybe the Dairy K since that‚Äôs like the only place I saw when I drove through town.‚Äù  
  
¬† She wasn‚Äôt comfortable hanging out amongst the graves like I was. That was normal. I was not. ‚ÄúYeah, okay,‚Äù I said and walked over to pick up my purse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your answer,‚Äù a soft voice whispered so quietly I almost thought I‚Äôd imagined it. Turning to look back at Bethy she was smiling with her hands tucked in her front pockets.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you say something?‚Äù I asked confused.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, you mean after I suggested we go to the Dairy K?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Did you whisper something?‚Äù  
  
¬† She scrunched her nose and then glanced around nervously and shook her head. ‚ÄúNope‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt we get out of here?‚Äù she said reaching for my arm and pulling me behind her back toward Jace‚Äôs car.  
  
¬† I looked back at my mom‚Äôs grave and a peace settled over me. Had that been‚Ä¶? No. Surely not. Shaking my head, I turned back around and went to get into the passenger side before Bethy threw me in.  
  
¬† Rush  
  
¬† It was my mother‚Äôs birthday. Nan had called me twice already a  
sking me to call our mother. I couldn‚Äôt do it. She was on a beach in the Bahamas with him. This hadn‚Äôt affected her at all. Once again she‚Äôd run off to enjoy her life while leaving her kids behind to figure things out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNan‚Äôs calling again. You want me to answer it and tell her to leave you the hell alone?‚Äù Grant walked into the living room holding up my cell phone in his hand while it rang.  
  
¬† Those two fought like actual siblings. ‚ÄúNo, give it to me,‚Äù I replied as he tossed me the phone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNan,‚Äù I said in greeting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you going to call Mother or not? She has called me twice now asking me if I talked to you and if you remembered it was her birthday. She does care about you. Stop letting that girl ruin everything, Rush. She pulled a gun on me for God‚Äôs sake. A gun, Rush. She is crazy. She‚Äî‚Äú  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop. Don‚Äôt say anything else. You don‚Äôt know her. You don‚Äôt want to know her. So just stop. I‚Äôm not calling Mom. The next time she calls tell her that. I don‚Äôt want to hear her voice. I don‚Äôt give a shit about her trip or what she got for her birthday.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOuch,‚Äù Grant muttered as he sank down on the couch across from me and propped his legs up on the ottoman in front of him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd say that. I don‚Äôt understand you. She can‚Äôt be that good in‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Nannette. This conversation is over. Call me if you need me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pressed end then slung my phone on the seat beside me and laid my head back on the cushion.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out. Drink a little. Dance with some girls. Forget this shit. All of it,‚Äù Grant said. He‚Äôd suggested this several times over the past three weeks. Or at least since I‚Äôd stopped breaking things and he felt it was safe enough to speak.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I replied without looking at him. There was no reason to act like I was okay. Until I knew Blaire was okay, I was never going to be okay. She may not forgive me. Hell she may never look at me again but I needed to know she was healing. I needed to know something. Anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been real good about not prying. I‚Äôve let you go crazy, roar at everything that moved and sulk. I think it‚Äôs time you told me something. What happened when you went to Alabama? Something had to have happened. You didn‚Äôt come back the same.‚Äù  
  
¬† I loved Grant like a brother but there was no way I was telling him about the night in the hotel room with Blaire. She‚Äôd been hurting and I‚Äôd been desperate. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about that. But I do need to get out. Stop staring at these walls and remembering her‚Ä¶ yeah I need to get out.‚Äù I stood up and Grant jumped up from his spot on the couch. The relief in his eyes was obvious.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you up for? Beer or girls or both?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLoud music,‚Äù I replied. I really didn‚Äôt need any beer and the girls‚Ä¶ I just wasn‚Äôt ready for that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to leave town. Maybe head to Destin?‚Äù  
  
¬† I threw my car keys at him. ‚ÄúSure, lead the way.‚Äù  
  
¬† The doorbell rang stopping both of us. The last time I‚Äôd had an unexpected guest it hadn‚Äôt ended well. It very likely could be the cops coming to arrest me for bashing Cain‚Äôs face in. Oddly enough, I didn‚Äôt care. I was numb.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it,‚Äù Grant said, glancing at me with a concerned frown. He was thinking the same thing.  
  
¬† I sat back down on the sofa and propped my feet up on the coffee table in front of me. My mom hated it when I put my feet on this table. She‚Äôd bought it during one of her international shopping trips and had it shipped back here. I felt a sudden pang of guilt for not calling her but I pushed it away. My entire life I‚Äôd made that woman happy and taken care of Nan. I wasn‚Äôt doing that anymore. I was done. With all her shit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJace, what‚Äôs up? We were just headed out. You want to come with?‚Äù Grant said stepping back and letting Jace walk into the house. I didn‚Äôt get up. I wanted him to leave. Seeing Jace reminded me of Bethy who then reminded me of Blaire. Jace needed to leave.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, no, I uh‚Ä¶ I needed to talk to you about something,‚Äù Jace said, shuffling his feet and stuffing his hands in his pockets. He looked ready to bolt out the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúToday might not be the best time to talk to him, man,‚Äù Grant said, stepping in front of Jace and focusing on me. ‚ÄúWe were gonna head out. Let‚Äôs go. Jace can bare his soul later.‚Äù  
  
¬† Now I was curious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a loose cannon, Grant. Sit down. Let him talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant let out a sigh and shook his head. ‚ÄúFine. You wanna tell him this shit now, then tell him.‚Äù  
  
¬† Jaceglanced over at Grant nervously then he looked back at me. He walked over and sat down on the chair furthest from me. I watched as he tucked his hair behind his ear and wondered what he had to say that was such a big deal.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBethy and I are getting kinda serious,‚Äù he started. I already knew this. I didn‚Äôt care. I felt the pain crack open my chest and I clenched my fists.I had to concentrate on forcing air into my lungs. Bethy had been Blaire‚Äôs friend. She‚Äôd know how Blaire was. ‚ÄúAnd uh‚Ä¶ well Bethy‚Äôs rent went up and that place was shitty anyway. I didn‚Äôt feel safe with her staying there. So, I talked to Woods and he said that his dad had a two bedroom condo available if I wanted to rent that. I uh, got it for her and paid the deposit and everything. But when I took her to see it she got pissed. Big time pissed. She didn‚Äôt want me to pay her rent. She said it made her feel cheap.‚Äù He sighed and the apologetic look in his eyes still made no sense. I didn‚Äôt care about his fight with Bethy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs twice as much‚Ä¶ or, at least, Bethy thinks it is twice as much as her last place. It is actually four times as much as her last place. I swore Woods to secrecy. I‚Äôm paying the other portion without her knowing. Anyway. She, uh‚Ä¶ she‚Ä¶ took off to Alabama today. She loves the condo. She wants to live on the club property and on the beach. But the only person she would even consider having as a roommate is‚Ä¶ Blaire.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stood up. I couldn‚Äôt sit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhoa man‚Ä¶ sit down.‚Äù Grant jumped up and I waved him off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad. I just need to breathe,‚Äù I said, staring out the glass doors at the waves crashing against the shore. Bethy had gone to get Blaire. My heart was racing. Would she come?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know the two of you had a bad end. I asked her not to but she got real mad and I don‚Äôt like to upset her. She said she missed Blaire and that Blaire needed someone. She, uh, also talked to Woods about giving Blaire back her job if she can get Blaire to come back.‚Äù  
  
¬† Blaire.Coming back‚Ä¶  
  
¬† She wouldn‚Äôt come back. She hated me. She hated Nan. She hated my mom. She hated her father. She wouldn‚Äôt come back here‚Ä¶ but God, I wanted her to. I turned my head and looked at Jace.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt come back,‚Äù I said. The pain in my voice was undeniable. I didn‚Äôt care about hiding it. Not anymore.  
  
¬† Jace shrugged.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe may have had enough time to deal with things. What if she does come back? What will you do?‚Äù Grant asked me.  
  
¬† What would I do?  
  
¬† I‚Äôd beg.  
  
¬† Blaire  
  
¬† Bethy pulled Jace‚Äôs car into the parking lot of the Dairy K. I noticed Callie‚Äôs little blue Volkswagen and decided against getting out of the car. I‚Äôd only seen Callie twice since I returned and she‚Äôd been ready to claw my eyes out. She‚Äôd had her sights on Cain since high school. I‚Äôd come home and messed up whatever kind of relationship they‚Äôd finally managed to have. I hadn‚Äôt meant to. She could have Cain.  
  
¬† Bethy started to get out of the car and I grabbed her arm. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just talk in the car,‚Äù I said, stopping her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut I want some ice cream mixed with Oreos,‚Äù she complained.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk in there. I know too many people,‚Äù I explained.  
  
¬† Bethy sighed and leaned back in her seat. ‚ÄúOkay fine. My ass doesn‚Äôt need any ice cream and cookies anyway.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled and relaxed, thankful for the dark tinted windows. Knowing I wasn‚Äôt on display as people stopped and stared at Jace‚Äôs car. No one around here drove cars even close to this one‚Äôs league.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äô  
m not gonna beat around the bush with this, Blaire. I miss you. I‚Äôve never had a close girlfriend before. Ever. Then you came along and then you left. I hate you being gone. Work sucks without you there. I have no one to tell about my sex life with Jace and how sweet he‚Äôs being which is something I wouldn‚Äôt have if I hadn‚Äôt listened to you. I just miss you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt tears sting my eyes. Just being missed felt good. I missed her too. I missed a lot of things. ‚ÄúI miss you too,‚Äù I replied, hoping I didn‚Äôt get all weepy.  
  
¬† Bethy nodded and a smile tugged on her lips. ‚ÄúOkay good. Because I need you to come back and live with me.Jace got me a waterfront condo on the club‚Äôs property. I, however, refuse to let him pay for it. So I need a roommate. Please come back. I need you. And Woods said you‚Äôd have your job back immediately.‚Äù  
  
¬† Go back to Rosemary? Where Rush was‚Ä¶ and Nan‚Ä¶ and my dad. I couldn‚Äôt go back. I couldn‚Äôt see them. They‚Äôd be at the club. Would my dad take Nan to play golf? Could I see that? No. I couldn‚Äôt. It would be too much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I choked out. I wished I could. I didn‚Äôt know where I was going to go now that I knew I was pregnant but I couldn‚Äôt go to Rosemary and I couldn‚Äôt stay here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, Blaire. He misses you too. He never leaves his house. Jace said he‚Äôs pitiful.‚Äù  
  
¬† The angry wound in my chest flared to life. Knowing Rush was hurting too was hard. I‚Äôd imagined him having his house parties and moving on. I didn‚Äôt want him to still be sad. I just needed for us to move on. But maybe I never would. I‚Äôd always have a reminder of Rush.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see them. Any of them. It would be too hard,‚Äù I stopped. I couldn‚Äôt tell Bethy about my pregnancy. I had hardly had time to comprehend it. I wasn‚Äôt ready to tell anyone. I might never tell anyone other than Cain. I would be leaving here soon enough. Where I went I wouldn‚Äôt know anyone. I‚Äôd be starting over.  
Your‚Ä¶ uh Dad and Georgianna aren‚Äôt there. They left. Nan is but she is quieter now. I think she‚Äôs worried about Rush. It would be hard at first but after you ripped the bandage off you‚Äôd get over them. Over everything. Besides, the way Woods‚Äô eyes lit up when I mentioned you coming back you could distract yourself with him. He is more than interested.‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt want Woods. And nothing would distract me. Bethy didn‚Äôt know everything. I couldn‚Äôt tell her that either. Not today.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAs much as I want to‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was sorry. Moving in with Bethy and getting my job back at the club would be the answer to my problems, almost.  
  
¬† Bethy let out a frustrated sigh and laid her head back on the seat and closed her eyes. ‚ÄúOkay. I get it. I don‚Äôt like it but I get it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I reached over and squeezed her hand tightly. I wished things were different. If Rush were just some guy I had broken up with it would be. But he wasn‚Äôt. He never would be. He was more. Much more than she could understand.  
  
¬† Bethy squeezed my hand back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to let this go for today. But I‚Äôm not looking for another roommate right away. I‚Äôm giving you a week to think about this. Then I have to find someone to help me pay the bills. So will you? Think about it?‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded because I knew that was what she needed even if I knew her waiting was pointless.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll just go home and pray if God even remembers who the hell I am.‚Äù She winked at me and then reached across the seat to hug me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEat some food for me, okay? You‚Äôre getting too skinny,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied, wondering if that were going to be possible.  
  
¬† Bethy sat back. ‚ÄúWell, if you aren‚Äôt gonna pack up and head back to Rosemary with me then at least let‚Äôs go out. I need to stay the night before I do that drive again. We can go find some fun somewhere and then crash at a hotel.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúYes. That sounds good. Just no honky-tonks.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt walk into another one of those. At least not this soon.  
  
¬† Bethy frowned. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ but is there anything else in this state?‚Äù  
  
¬† She had a point. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ we can drive into Birmingham. It‚Äôs the closest big city.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPerfect. Let‚Äôs go have some fun.‚Äù  
  
¬† When we pulled into the driveway at Granny Q‚Äôs she was sitting outside on the porch shelling peas. I didn‚Äôt want to face her but she had given me a roof over my head for three weeks with no strings attached. She deserved an explanation if she wanted one. I wasn‚Äôt sure Cain had told her anything. His truck wasn‚Äôt here and I was immensely grateful.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant me to stay in the car?‚Äù Bethy asked. It would be easier if she did but Granny Q would see her and call me out for being rude if I didn‚Äôt let my friend come inside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can come with me,‚Äù I told her and opened the car door.  
  
¬† Bethy walked around the front of the car and fell into step beside me. Granny Q hadn‚Äôt looked up from her peas yet but I knew she‚Äôd heard us. She was thinking about what she was going to say. Cain must have told her. Dang it.  
  
¬† I looked over at her as she continued to shell those peas in silence. Her short white bobbed hair was all I could see of her. No eye contact. It would be so much easier to just go inside and take advantage of her not speaking to me. But this was her home. If she didn‚Äôt want me here I needed to pack up and leave.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Granny Q,‚Äù I said and stopped, waiting for her to lift her head to look at me.  
  
¬† Silence. She was upset with me. Disappointed or mad; I wasn‚Äôt sure which. I hated Cain right now for telling her. Couldn‚Äôt he keep his mouth shut?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is my friend Bethy. She came to visit me today,‚Äù I continued.  
  
¬† Granny Q finally raised her head and gave Bethy a smile then turned her eyes on me. ‚ÄúYou take her on in and fix her a nice big glass of iced tea and give her one of them fried pies I got cooling on the table. Then you come on back out here and talk to me a minute, hmmm.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt a request; it was a subtle demand. I nodded and led Bethy inside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you piss off the old lady?‚Äù Bethy whispered when we were safely inside.  
  
¬† I shrugged. I wasn‚Äôt sure. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know just yet,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† I went to the cabinet and got a tall glass down and went to fixing Bethy a glass of iced tea. I didn‚Äôt even ask her if she wanted it. I was just trying to do what Granny Q had said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere. Drink this and eat a fried pie. I‚Äôll be back in a few minutes,‚Äù I said and hurried back outside. I needed to get this over with.  
  
¬† Blaire  
  
¬† The wooden planks cracked under my feet as I stepped back onto the front porch of Granny Q‚Äôs house. I let the screen door close behind me with a loud bang before remembering it was old and its springs were long ago rusted. I‚Äôd spent many days of my childhood on this front porch shelling peas with Cain and Granny Q. I didn‚Äôt want her upset with me. My stomach twisted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSit down girl and stop looking like you‚Äôre ready to cry. God knows I love ya like you‚Äôre my own. Thought you would be one day.‚Äù She shook her head. ‚ÄúStupid boy couldn‚Äôt get it together. I hoped he‚Äôd wake up ‚Äòfore it was too late. But he didn‚Äôt, did he? You done gone and found ya someone else.‚Äù  
  
¬† This had not been what I was expecting. I took the seat across from her and began shelling peas so I wouldn‚Äôt have to look at her. ‚ÄúCain and I were over three years ago. Nothing that is happening now is affecting that. He is my friend, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù  
  
¬† Granny Q made ahmph sound and shifted in the porch swing she was sitting in. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that. You two wereinseparable as kids. Even as a boy he couldn‚Äôt keep his eyes off you. It was funny to watch how much he adored you and didn‚Äôt even realize it himself. But boys hit them teenage years and lose their ever loving minds. I hate he did. I hate he lost you, girl. ‚ÄòCause there won‚Äôt be another Blaire for Cain. You were it for him.‚Äù  
  
¬† She hadn‚Äôt mentioned my pregnancy tests. Did she even know I‚Äôd bought them? I didn‚Äôt want to recap my past with Cain. Sure we had history but there was so much sadness and regret that I didn‚Äôt want to go there. I‚Äôd been living in a lie my father had constructed then. Remembering it hurt. ‚ÄúHas Cain come by here today?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. He came by this morning looking for ya. I told him you‚Äôd not come back home from your early escape. He looked worried and turned and left without telling me anythin‚Äô else. He‚Äôd been crying though. Don‚Äôt reckon I‚Äôve ever seen him cry before. Least not since he was a boy.‚Äù  
  
¬† He‚Äôd been crying? I closed my eyes and dropped the peas into the large plastic bucket Granny Q was using. Cain wasn‚Äôt supposed to be upset. He wasn‚Äôt supposed to cry. He‚Äôd let me go a long time ago. Why was this so hard on him? ‚ÄúHow long ago was that?‚Äù I asked, thinking about the hours that had passed since I‚Äôd bared my soul to him in the parking lot of the pharmacy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, ‚Äòbout nine hours ago I‚Äôd guess. It was early. He was a mess, girl. At least go find him and talk to him. No matter how you feel about him now he needs to hear from you that things are okay.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúCan I use your phone?‚Äù I asked, standing up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course you can. Eat you one of them fried pies while you‚Äôre in there. I made enough for an army after he ran off this morning. They‚Äôre his favorite flavor,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCherry,‚Äù I replied and she gave me a smile. I could see so many things in those eyes of hers. I knew Cain. Nothing about him surprised me. I understood him. We had a past. I loved his family and they obviously loved me too. This was safe.  
  
¬† Bethy was standing on the other side of the door sipping her glass of sweet tea and holding her phone out to me. She‚Äôd been listening. I wasn‚Äôt surprised.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall the boy. Get this over with,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† I took her phone and walked into the living room to give myself some privacy before dialing Cain‚Äôs number. I knew it by heart. He‚Äôd had the same number since he got his first cell phone when we were sixteen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù came his reply. I could hear the hesitation in his voice. Something was off. He sound  
ed like he was talking through his nose.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCain? Are you okay?‚Äù I asked suddenly worried about him.  
  
¬† There was a pause then a long sigh. ‚ÄúBlaire. Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in Rosemary Beach.‚Äù  
  
¬† He was in Rosemary? What? I sank down on the sofa behind me and gripped the phone tighter. Was he telling Rush? My heart slammed against my chest and I closed my eyes tightly before asking, ‚ÄúWhy are in you in Rosemary? Please tell me you didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt say it. Not with Bethy in the other room and more than likely listening to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI needed to see his face. I needed to see if he loved you. I needed to know‚Ä¶ because, I just needed to know.‚Äù That made no sense.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did you say to him? How did you find him? Did you find him?‚Äù Maybe he hadn‚Äôt found him. Maybe I could stop this.  
  
¬† There was a hard chuckle on the other end of the line. ‚ÄúYeah, I found him alright. Ain‚Äôt real hard. This place is small and everyone knows where the rock star‚Äôs son lives.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh god, oh god, oh god... ‚ÄúWhat did you say to him?‚Äù I asked slowly as horror washed over me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell him. I wouldn‚Äôt do that to you. Give me some damn credit. I cheated on you because I was a horny ass teenage boy but dammit Blaire when are you gonna forgive me? Will I pay for that mistake the rest of my life? I‚Äôm sorry! GOD I‚Äôm so fucking sorry. I would go back and change everything if I could.‚Äù He stopped and made a grunt that sounded like he was hurting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCain. What‚Äôs wrong with you? Are you okay?‚Äù I asked. I didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge what he‚Äôd said. I knew he was sorry. I was too. But no, I was never going to get over it. Forgiving was one thing. Forgetting was another.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm just a little battered. Let‚Äôs just say the guy isn‚Äôt crazy about me, okay.‚Äù  
  
¬† The guy. Rush? Had Rush hurt him? That didn‚Äôt sound like Rush at all. ‚ÄúWhat guy?‚Äù  
  
¬† Cain sighed, ‚ÄúRush.‚Äù  
  
¬† My jaw fell open as I stared straight ahead. Rush had hurt Cain? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I got a room for the night and I‚Äôm sleeping this off. I‚Äôll be home tomorrow. We have some things to talk about.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCain. Why did Rush hurt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Another pause and then a weary sigh. ‚ÄúBecause I asked questions that he didn‚Äôt think were my business. I‚Äôll be home tomorrow.‚Äù  
  
¬† He asked questions. What kind of questions?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBlaire, you don‚Äôt have to tell him. I‚Äôll take care of you. Just‚Ä¶ we need to talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† He‚Äôd take care of me? What was he talking about? I wasn‚Äôt going to let him take care of me. ‚ÄúWhere are you exactly?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSome hotel just outside of Rosemary. They think their shit don‚Äôt stink in that town. Everything there costs five times too much.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. Stay in bed and I‚Äôll see you tomorrow.‚Äù I replied then hung up.  
  
¬† Bethy stepped into the room. She cocked one of her dark eyebrows as she stared at me waiting. She‚Äôd been listening. I‚Äôdknown she would.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need a ride to Rosemary,‚Äù I told her standing up. I couldn‚Äôt let Cain lay hurt in a hotel room and I couldn‚Äôt chance that he‚Äôd go back and try to talk to Rush again. If Bethy could drive me there I could check on him and then drive him home.  
  
¬† Bethy nodded and a small smile tugged on her lips. I could tell she didn‚Äôt want me to see how happy she was to hear this. I wasn‚Äôt staying. She didn‚Äôt need to get her hopes up. ‚ÄúThis is just about Cain. I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt stay there.‚Äù  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt appear to believe me. ‚ÄúSure. I know.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to convince her. I handed her the phone and headed back to my temporary bedroom to pack some things.  
  
¬† Rush  
  
¬† Grant had finally given up on me and gone to dance with one of the girls who had been flirting with us since we walked into the club. He‚Äôd come here for some fun and I‚Äôd needed the distraction but now that I was here I just wanted to leave. Taking a drink of my beer I tried not to make eye contact with anyone. I kept my head down and a scowl on my face. It wasn‚Äôt hard to do.  
  
¬† Jace‚Äôs words kept replaying in my head. I was scared‚Ä¶ No; I was terrified to let myself believe that she‚Äôd come back here. I‚Äôd seen her face that night in the hotel room. She was empty. The emotion in her eyes was gone. She had been finished- with me, with her father, with everything. Love was cruel. So fucking cruel.  
  
¬† The bar stool beside me scraped across the floor as it was moved back. I didn‚Äôt look over at it. I didn‚Äôt want anyone to talk to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease tell me that ugly scowl on your pretty face isn‚Äôt over a girl. You might break my heart.‚Äù The smooth female voice was familiar.  
  
¬† I tilted my head to the side just enough to see her face. Although she was older now I recognized her immediately. There are some things a guy doesn‚Äôt forget in life and the girl who takes his virginity is one of them. Meg Carter. She‚Äôd been three years older than me and visiting her grandmother the summer I turned fourteen. It hadn‚Äôt been a love connection. More like a life lesson.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMeg,‚Äù I replied, relieved it wasn‚Äôt another unknown female here to throw herself at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd he remembers my name. I‚Äôm impressed,‚Äù she replied then looked up at the bartender and smiled. ‚ÄúJack and Coke please.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGuy doesn‚Äôt forget his first.‚Äù  
  
¬† She shifted on her stool, crossing her legs and tilting her head to look at me causing her long dark hair to fall over one shoulder. She still wore it long. I‚Äôd been fascinated with it back then.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMost guys don‚Äôt but you‚Äôve led a different life compared to most guys. The fame has to have changed you over the years.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs famous not me,‚Äù I snapped, hating it when females wanted to talk about something they knew nothing about. Meg and I had fucked a few times but she didn‚Äôt really know much about me back then.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHmmm, whatever. So, why you so glum?‚Äù  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt glum. I was a broken mess. But she wasn‚Äôt someone I intended to unload on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I replied and glanced back at the dance floor hoping to catch Grant‚Äôs attention. I was ready to go.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve got a broken heart from hell and don‚Äôt know what to do with it,‚Äù she said reaching for her Jack and Coke.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna talk to you about my personal life, Meg.‚Äù I let the warning edge in my voice ring through loud and clear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhoa there, handsome. I wasn‚Äôt trying to piss you off. Just making small talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† My personal life wasn‚Äôt small talk. ‚ÄúThen ask me about the fucking weather,‚Äù I said with a snarl.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt respond and I was glad. Maybe she‚Äôd move on. Leave me alone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in town taking care of my Grans. She‚Äôs sick and I needed something new to do with my life. I just went through a messy divorce. A change of scenery from Chicago was what I needed. I‚Äôll be here for at least six months. Do you think you‚Äôll be ornery the entire time I‚Äôm here or are you gonna get nicer anytime in the near future?‚Äù  
  
¬† She wanted to see me. No. I wasn‚Äôt ready for that. I started to reply when my phone alerted me of a text message. Relieved to have an interruption so I could think about how I was going to respond to her I pulled it out of my pocket.  
  
¬† The number wasn‚Äôt one I recognized. But the ‚ÄúHey It‚Äôs Bethy‚Äù caught my attention and I stopped breathing as I opened the text to read the entire thing.  
  
¬† Hey it‚Äôs Bethy. If you aren‚Äôt a stupid fuck then you‚Äôll wake up and get with the program.  
  
¬† What the hell did that mean? What was I missing? Was Blaire in Rosemary? Is that what this meant?I stood up and put enough money on the bar to cover my beer and Meg‚Äôs drink. ‚ÄúI gotta go. It was nice to see you. Take care,‚Äù I said as an after thought as I stalked through the crowd until I found Grant having dry humping on the dance floor with some redhead.  
  
¬† His eyes met mine and I nodded at the door. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù I said and turned to head outside. I was leaving him here if he hadn‚Äôt c  
aught up with me by the time I reached my Range Rover. She could be here. I was going to find out. Asking Bethy what she meant by that jacked up text was pointless.  
  
¬† Blaire  
  
¬† I reached over and nudged Bethy‚Äôs leg to wake her up. She‚Äôd been asleep for the past two hours. We were just outside of Rosemary Beach and I needed her to drive so I could look for Cain‚Äôs truck at all the inexpensive motels.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe there?‚Äù she mumbled sleepily and sat up in her seat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlmost. I need you to drive. I gotta look for Cain‚Äôs truck.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy let out a weary sigh. I knew she was only doing this in hopes of getting me to Rosemary and keeping me there. She could care less about finding Cain. But I‚Äôd needed a ride. I was going to drive Cain home. And he and I were going to talk. He had no business coming out here to see Rush. I only hoped he hadn‚Äôt told him about what he‚Äôd caught me buying.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt that I wanted to keep it a secret from Rush. It was just that I hadn‚Äôt let everything sink in yet. I needed to process it. Figure out what I wanted to do. Then I‚Äôd contact Rush. Cain going after him like a crazy person was not what I wanted. I still couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd done it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPull over here. I need to run in and grab me a latte first,‚Äù Bethy instructed. I did as she asked and parked the car in front of Starbucks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou want something?‚Äù Bethy asked as she opened the door. I wasn‚Äôt sure that caffeine was good for the‚Ä¶ for the baby. I shook my head and waited until she got out of the car before I let out the sob in my chest I hadn‚Äôt been expecting. I hadn‚Äôt thought about what those two pink stripes meant. A baby. Rush‚Äôs baby. Oh, God.  
  
¬† I stepped out of the car and walked around the front to get into the passenger side. By the time I was back in the car and buckled up Bethy was headed back to the car. She looked a little more awake already. I pushed thoughts of my baby back and focused on finding Cain. I could dwell on my future, on my baby‚Äôs future later.

If you look at my last post I made a little bit before my one year anniversary, I wasn‚Äôt feeling the most positive. I remember thinking in the moment that I knew this would eventually pass and I would feel that gratitude again for being alcohol free. I just need to get through this rough patch. Well, I got over the anger and I‚Äôm back in grateful land today. 

To give you all a little background, I have a hard time making friends. I don‚Äôt even really have any friends. I don‚Äôt have girl friends who I can text or call at a whim. I don‚Äôt have girlfriends who I go grab lunch or coffee with. I have my husband‚Äôs friends and their wives‚Ä¶ which are great, but I only see them if we were all hanging out drinking. Not really having friends is a huge insecurity for me. I actually think it‚Äôs my biggest insecurity. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. It brings forth a lot of deep emotional pain from memories of trying to make friends growing up and failing again and again. It depresses me. 

I really thought alcohol was a bandaid for this problem. I did not think for a second that alcohol was the reason why I didn‚Äôt have girl friends. Why would it be?? I was a fun and nice drunk! Never mean. So it had to be something inherently wrong with me. Am I too weird? Too much? Am I not ‚Äòcool‚Äô enough? What is it? 

Turns out I wasn‚Äôt ever sober enough to make connections and friendships with people around me. 

It‚Äôs as simple as that. How do you make friends if you are always drunk when you are around people? The more get togethers and events I go to sober, the more I‚Äôm realizing that you actually have to try at making friends. It can be a little awkward. Especially for those with social anxiety like me. A huge reason why I drank. But friends don‚Äôt just fall in your lap‚Ä¶. you have to try. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. It‚Äôs not enough to be ‚Äònice‚Äô. You have to truly engage with other people. You have to get to know them, ask them questions. You have to make an effort to be available‚Ä¶ or make efforts to meet up. For most this is probably self explanatory‚Ä¶.. but for someone like me it was not. 

Now I‚Äôve been a year sober. My husband‚Äôs friends wife invited me to a small girls craft night with her and her friends. I almost turned down the initial offer due to the social anxiety of meeting more new people and not being with my husband. But I knew this is what I wanted. Friendship. And I‚Äôm so glad I went. I had an amazing time. At one point we ordered pizza and one of the girls asked if we wanted to also get wine. My friend told them I didn‚Äôt drink and asked if I was okay with it. Without skipping a beat the other girls immediately told me they could pick up some NA bevs for me but ended up also just sticking to sodas along with me the whole night. They didn‚Äôt have to do that. They truly didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm fine with people drinking around me right now. But they didn‚Äôt want me to feel left out. I don‚Äôt want to be dramatic‚Ä¶. but that meant the world to me. For someone who thought alcohol = friends it was amazing. It was beautiful.

Being sober while making friends is a vulnerable experience. But it‚Äôs literally the only way to make friends. I am eternally grateful tonight for my sobriety. IWNDWYT ",37,1753245406.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False
1m700e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1m700e6/illegal_underground_mechanic_robot_fighting/,Illegal Underground Mechanic Robot Fighting,"*The name is in progress, as is literally everything else*

**IUMRF** is something I am creating and I want to hear what people think of my concept.

In a dystopian Cyberpunk America, one of America‚Äôs new favorite pastimes is **Illegal Underground Mechanic Robot Fighting**.
 
**You**, the party, are newbies in a rookie league trying to break into the scene, and hopefully make bitz (digital currency) in the process.

Your stats are the following:
Force
Finesse
Fortitude
Focus
Flair,
Ffortune.

Your robot‚Äôs stats are:
Crank (force)
Swank (finesse)
Tank (fortitude)

There are 5 classes, each with branches:

**Striker:**
      **Mobster**
           Maybe a goon, maybe a grunt, maybe a godfather, but they got a baseball bat, and you‚Äôs got some nice kneecaps, be a shame if anything happened to them.
      **Controller**
           Unlike your main Melee, these are your skinny, nerdy, acne covered, video game playing melee users, important for any good Mech team.
      **Spy**
          Your recon guy with a knife, and sharp senses. Perfect for gathering info on your enemies, and learn that Big Joe is using illegal EMP to disable his enemies halfway through every fight.

**Marksmen:**
      **Sharpshooter**
           A sniper with eyes like no others, railgun users with glasses and a twisted moral compass. These shooters use focus as their main shooting ability
      **Gunslinger**
          A laser loner cowboy, people can‚Äôt help but wonder what is under that bandana, that is until looking down the barrels of both their laser pistols
      **Droner**
          They don‚Äôt shoot you themselves. Why would they, when their flying swarm of death can do it for them? Keeps one hand on the controller, the other on a coffee cup.

**Tactician:**
      **Representative**
          The bard of this game, they show up in a suit, slicked hair, and a smile that hides a dozen lawsuits. Talks fast, talks smooth, and somehow walks away with all your mech parts signed over.
      **Hacker**
          They‚Äôre halfway jacked into the grid, with fingers that type faster than bullets fly. Security? Firewalls? Corporate encryption? Puh-lease.
      **Arms dealer**
            They know a guy who knows a guy, and suddenly your mech has a plasma launcher that‚Äôs definitely not street legal. Just don‚Äôt ask where it came from. What are you, a cop?!

**Medic:**
      **Mechanic**
           Grease-stained jumpsuit, goggles on the forehead, and a wrench longer than your leg. They fix busted bots and patch holes in metal.
      **Patch**
           Quick with a stim, quicker with a lie. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good to go‚Äù they say, even if your arm‚Äôs hanging by a thread. Fastest med in the west, but never for free.

**Jack of all:**
      **Druggie**
          They got a pill, shot, or vial for every occasion. Need speed? Strength? To forget the last five minutes? Just you don‚Äôt ask what‚Äôs in it, for your own good.
      **Savver**
           A street-rat scrapper who cobbles together tools, hacks locks, and jury-rigs solutions from junk. A true skill monkey who‚Äôll punch every button, pull every lever, and MacGyver their way out of any jam.

This system is meant for combat optimization. You earn **Experience Points**, you use these to buy features, some with prerequisites, based on class, branch, other features bought, and any other bs I come up with. 
 You earn **Experience Points** based on what the DM decides, if you complete plot or story, this is how the DM rewards the players.

**Stats rules:**
  Each stat starts at 1, roll 2d6 and pick the highest roll of the two. That is how many skill points you have, you can customize these and distribute these in any stat, you cannot go past 6 in any stat.
 Your stats decide how may dice you roll, Ex:
     1: 1d4
     2: 2d4
     3: 3d4
     4: 4d4
     5: 5d4
     6: 6d4

**Fortune**
 This stat, can be used in 2 ways. One way is to roll when you need lucky, say you need to stumble into the right room at the right time, roll fortune.
 The other way is to push your roll, you can add a point from your fortune stat to any roll to increase the roll by however many points you use, similar to CoC, but these come back after you rest to your original stat. You cannot lower your fortune stat past one.

**Fight Gonna Start? Roll!**
     Initiative = Finesse + 1d6 for humans
     Initiative = Swank + 1d4 for mechs
     Humans can highten/lower their roll before combat starts to alter the order to be what they want. 

**Combat for humans**

Combat for humans runs in **beats**. Every round, each human gets 3 Beats to spenf however they want.

**Beat Cost Rules:**
	**1 Beat**: Actions that don‚Äôt require a roll (e.g., moving, drawing a weapon, shouting a quick command, interacting with objects)
	**2 Beats**: Actions that require a roll (e.g., attacking, hacking, grappling, bluffing, medic checks)

**Combos**
 Combos trigger when your teammates coordinate their actions in the same round.
 If you take an action within the same Beat window (round) that interacts with or builds off what another character with a certain class is doing, you trigger a **combo**

# Mech Systems! #
  **Building**
          Mechs are defined by 3 stats, slots, and parts.
      Core Stats
	‚Ä¢	Crank = Strength (melee damage, carrying weight, shove/throw)
	‚Ä¢	Swank = Agility (evasion, initiative, mobility)
	‚Ä¢	Tank = Armor & Durability (damage soak, HP, resistance)

Each mech has a pool of **MP (Mech Points)** to spend at creation.
	‚Ä¢	Starting MP: 12
	‚Ä¢	1 MP = +1 to a stat (can go past 6)
	‚Ä¢	1 MP = 1 Slot (see below)
	‚Ä¢	1 MP = Base HP upgrade (+4 HP)
	‚Ä¢	1 MP = Base Heat tolerance (+1 Max Heat)

**Default Base:**
	‚Ä¢	2 Crank, 2 Swank, 2 Tank
	‚Ä¢	10 HP
	‚Ä¢	3 Slots
	‚Ä¢	3 Max Heat

**Slot Types**
	‚Ä¢	Weapon
	‚Ä¢	Defense
	‚Ä¢	Mobility
	‚Ä¢	Utility
	‚Ä¢	Support

You can mix freely, a 5 weapon freak or a stealthy speedy bot is fair game‚Ä¶ if you can survive with 6 HP and no Tank.

Story wise, there is more to this than robots, rebel against the government, climb to the top, create a world for your party, I want this to be without lore so that the GM can make it fit their world, this doesn‚Äôt even have to be illegal underground fighting, this could be making mechs to fight demons from another plane or something, my favorite part is finding interesting ways to make a ttrpg more that what it is and I want to give that freedom to other GMs

Right now, specific robot combat that is different than human combat is a WIP, but Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day, and neither will this. I wanna hear your feedback.

Also what cool quirky name should I give the GM? Game mechanic instead of game master? Idk",4,1753245404.0,RPGdesign,1,1.0,False

¬† The longest day of my life began tardily. I woke up late, took too long in the shower, and ended up having to enjoy my breakfast in the passenger seat of my mom‚Äôs minivan at 7:17 that Wednesday morning.  
  
¬† I usually got a ride to school with my best friend, Ben Starling, but Ben had gone to school on time, making him useless to me. ‚ÄúOn time‚Äù for us was thirty minutes before school actually started, because the half hour before the first bell was the highlight of our social calendars: standing outside the side door that led into the band room and just talking. Most of my friends were in band, and most of my free time during school was spent within twenty feet of the band room. But I was not in the band, because I suffer from the kind of tone deafness that is generally associated with actual deafness. I was going to be twenty minutes late, which technically meant that I‚Äôd still be ten minutes early for school itself.  
  
¬† As she drove, Mom was asking me about classes and finals and prom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in prom,‚Äù I reminded her as she rounded a corner. I expertly angled my raisin bran to accommodate the g-forces. I‚Äôd done this before.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs no harm in just going with a friend. I‚Äôm sure you could ask Cassie Hiney. ‚Äù And I could have asked Cassie Hiney, who was actually perfectly nice and pleasant and cute, despite having a fantastically unfortunate last name.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that I don‚Äôt like prom. I also don‚Äôt like people who like prom,‚Äù I explained, although this was, in point of fact, untrue. Ben was absolutely gaga over the idea of going.  
  
¬† Mom turned into school, and I held the mostly empty bowl with both hands as we drove over a speed bump. I glanced over at the senior parking lot. Margo Roth Spiegelman‚Äôs silver Honda was parked in its usual spot. Mom pulled the minivan into a cul-de-sac outside the band room and kissed me on the cheek. I could see Ben and my other friends standing in a semicircle.  
  
¬† I walked up to them, and the half circle effortlessly expanded to include me. They were talking about my ex-girlfriend Suzie Chung, who played cello and was apparently creating quite a stir by dating a baseball player named Taddy Mac. Whether this was his given name, I did not know. But at any rate, Suzie had decided to go to prom with Taddy Mac. Another casualty.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBro,‚Äù said Ben, standing across from me. He nodded his head and turned around. I followed him out of the circle and through the door. A small, olive-skinned creature who had hit puberty but never hit it very hard, Ben had been my best friend since fifth grade, when we both finally owned up to the fact that neither of us was likely to attract anyone else as a best friend. Plus, he tried hard, and I liked that‚Äîmost of the time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow ya doin‚Äô?‚Äù I asked. We were safely inside, everyone else‚Äôs conversations making ours inaudible.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRadar is going to prom,‚Äù he said morosely. Radar was our other best friend. We called him Radar because he looked like a little bespectacled guy called Radar on this old TV show M\*A\*S\*H, except 1. The TV Radar wasn‚Äôt black, and 2. At some point after the nicknaming, our Radar grew about six inches and started wearing contacts, so I suppose that 3. He actually didn‚Äôt look like the guy on M\*A\*S\*H at all, but 4. With three and a half weeks left of high school, we weren‚Äôt very well going to renickname him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat girl Angela?‚Äù I asked. Radar never told us anything about his love life, but this did not dissuade us from frequent speculation.  
  
¬† Ben nodded, and then said, ‚ÄúYou know my big plan to ask a freshbunny to prom because they‚Äôre the only girls who don‚Äôt know the Bloody Ben story?‚Äù I nodded.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Ben said, ‚Äúthis morning some darling little ninth-grade honeybunny came up to me and asked me if I was Bloody Ben, and I began to explain that it was a kidney infection, and she giggled and ran away. So that‚Äôs out. ‚Äù  
  
¬† In tenth grade, Ben was hospitalized for a kidney infection, but Becca Arrington, Margo‚Äôs best friend, started a rumor that the real reason he had blood in his urine was due to chronic masturbation. Despite its medical implausibility, this story had haunted Ben ever since. ‚ÄúThat sucks,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Ben started outlining plans for finding a date, but I was only half listening, because through the thickening mass of humanity crowding the hallway, I could see Margo Roth Spiegelman. She was next to her locker, standing beside her boyfriend, Jase. She wore a white skirt to her knees and a blue print top. I could see her collarbone. She was laughing at something hysterical‚Äîher shoulders bent forward, her big eyes crinkling at their corners, her mouth open wide. But it didn‚Äôt seem to be anything Jase had said, because she was looking away from him, across the hallway to a bank of lockers. I followed her eyes and saw Becca Arrington draped all over some baseball player like she was an ornament and he a Christmas tree. I smiled at Margo, even though I knew she couldn‚Äôt see me.  
Bro, you should just hit that. Forget about Jase. God, that is one candy-coated honeybunny. ‚Äù As we walked, I kept taking glances at her through the crowd, quick snapshots: a photographic series entitled Perfection Stands Still While Mortals Walk Past. As I got closer, I thought maybe she wasn‚Äôt laughing after all. Maybe she‚Äôd received a surprise or a gift or something. She couldn‚Äôt seem to close her mouth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said to Ben, still not listening, still trying to see as much of her as I could without being too obvious. It wasn‚Äôt even that she was so pretty. She was just so awesome, and in the literal sense. And then we were too far past her, too many people walking between her and me, and I never even got close enough to hear her speak or understand whatever the hilarious surprise had been. Ben shook his head, because he had seen me see her a thousand times, and he was used to it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHonestly, she‚Äôs hot, but she‚Äôs not that hot. You know who‚Äôs seriously hot?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLacey,‚Äù he said, who was Margo‚Äôs other best friend. ‚ÄúAlso your mom. Bro, I saw your mom kiss you on the cheek this morning, and forgive me, but I swear to God I was like, man, I wish I was Q. And also, I wish my cheeks had penises. ‚Äù I elbowed him in the ribs, but I was still thinking about Margo, because she was the only legend who lived next door to me. Margo Roth Spiegelman, whose six-syllable name was often spoken in its entirety with a kind of quiet reverence. Margo Roth Spiegelman, whose stories of epic adventures would blow through school like a summer storm: an old guy living in a broken-down house in Hot Coffee, Mississippi, taught Margo how to play the guitar. Margo Roth Spiegelman, who spent three days traveling with the circus‚Äîthey thought she had potential on the trapeze. Margo Roth Spiegelman, who drank a cup of herbal tea with the Mallionaires backstage after a concert in St. Louis while they drank whiskey. Margo Roth Spiegelman, who got into that concert by telling the bouncer she was the bassist‚Äôs girlfriend, and didn‚Äôt they recognize her, and come on guys seriously, my name is Margo Roth Spiegelman and if you go back there and ask the bassist to take one look at me, he will tell you that I either am his girlfriend or he wishes I was, and then the bouncer did so, and then the bassist said ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs my girlfriend let her in the show,‚Äù and then later the bassist wanted to hook up with her and she rejected the bassist from the Mallionaires.  
  
¬† The stories, when they were shared, inevitably ended with, I mean, can you believe it? We often could not, but they always proved true.  
  
¬† And then we were at our lockers. Radar was leaning against Ben‚Äôs locker, typing into a handheld device.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre going to prom,‚Äù I said to him. He looked up, and then looked back down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm de-vandalizing the Omnictionary article about a former prime minister of France. Last night someone deleted the entire entry and then replaced it with the sentence ‚ÄòJacques Chirac is a gay,‚Äô which as it happens is incorrect both factually and grammatically. ‚Äù Radar is a big-time editor of this online user-created reference source called Omnictionary. His whole life is devoted to the maintenance and well-being of Omnictionary. This was but one of several reasons why his having a prom date was somewhat surprising.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre going to prom,‚Äù I repeated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said without looking up. It was a well-known fact that I was opposed to prom. Absolutely nothing about any of it appealed to me‚Äînot slow dancing, not fast dancing, not the dresses, and definitely not the rented tuxedo. Renting a tuxedo seemed to me an excellent way to contract some hideous disease from its previous tenant, and I did not aspire to become the world‚Äôs only virgin with pubic lice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBro,‚Äù Ben said to Radar, ‚Äúthe freshhoneys know about the Bloody Ben story. ‚Äù Radar put the handheld away finally and nodded sympathetically. ‚ÄúSo anyway,‚Äù Ben continued, ‚Äúmy two remaining strategies are either to purchase a prom date on the Internet or fly to Missouri and kidnap some nice corn-fed little honeybunny. ‚Äù I‚Äôd tried telling Ben that ‚Äúhoneybunny‚Äù sounded more sexist and lame than retro-cool, but he refused to abandon the practice. He called his own mother a honeybunny. There was no fixing him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask Angela if she knows anybody,‚Äù Radar said. ‚ÄúAlthough getting you a date to prom will be harder than turning lead into gold. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGetting you a date to prom is so hard that the hypothetical idea itself is actually used to cut diamonds,‚Äù I added.  
  
¬† Radar tapped a locker twice with his fist to express his approval, and then came back with another. ‚ÄúBen, getting you a date to prom is so hard that the American government believes the problem cannot be solved with diplomacy, but will instead require force. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I was trying to think of another one when we all three simultaneously saw the human-shaped container of anabolic steroids known as Chuck Parson walking toward us with some intent. Chuck Parson did not participate in organized sports, because to do so would distract from the larger goal of his life: to one day be convicted of homicide. ‚ÄúHey, faggots,‚Äù he called.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúChuck,‚Äù I answered, as friendly as I could muster. Chuck hadn‚Äôt given us any serious trouble in a couple years‚Äîsomeone in cool kid land laid down the edict that we were to be left alone. So it was a little unusual for him even to talk to us.  
  
¬† Maybe because I spoke and maybe not, he slammed his hands against the lockers on either side of me and then leaned in close enough for me to contemplate his toothpaste brand. ‚ÄúWhat do you know about Margo and Jase?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh,‚Äù I said. I thought of everything I knew about them: Jase was Margo Roth Spiegelman‚Äôs first and only serious boyfriend. They began dating at the tail end of last year. They were both going to University of Florida next year. Jase got a baseball scholarship there. He was never over at her house, except to pick her up. She never acted as if she liked him all that much, but then she never acted as if she liked anyone all that much. ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said finally.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shit me around,‚Äù he growled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI barely even know her,‚Äù I said, which had become true.  
  
¬† He considered my answer for a minute, and I tried hard to stare at his close-set eyes. He nodded very slightly, pushed off the lockers, and walked away to attend his first-period class: The Care and Feeding of Pectoral Muscles. The second bell rang. One minute to class. Radar and I had calc; Ben had finite mathematics. The classrooms were adjacent; we walked toward them together, the three of us in a row, trusting that the tide of classmates would part enough to let us by, and it did.  
  
¬† I said, ‚ÄúGetting you a date to prom is so hard that a thousand monkeys typing at a thousand typewriters for a thousand years would never once type ‚ÄòI will go to prom with Ben. ‚Äô‚Äù  
  
¬† Ben could not resist tearing himself apart. ‚ÄúMy prom prospects are so poor that Q‚Äôs grandma turned me down. She said she was waiting for Radar to ask her. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Radar nodded his head slowly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true, Q. Your grandma loves the brothers. ‚Äù  
  
¬† It was so pathetically easy to forget about Chuck, to talk about prom even though I didn‚Äôt give a shit about prom. Such was life that morning: nothing really mattered that much, not the good things and not the bad ones. We were in the business of mutual amusement, and we were reasonably prosperous.  
  
¬† I spent the next three hours in classrooms, trying not to look at the clocks above various blackboards, and then looking at the clocks, and then being amazed that only a few minutes had passed since I last looked at the clock. I‚Äôd had nearly four years of experience looking at these clocks, but their sluggishness never ceased to surprise. If I am ever told that I have one day to live, I will head straight for the hallowed halls of Winter Park High School, where a day has been known to last a thousand years.  
  
¬† But as much as it felt like third-period physics would never end, it did, and then I was in the cafeteria with Ben. Radar had fifth-period lunch with most of our other friends, so Ben and I generally sat together alone, a couple seats between us and a group of drama kids we knew. Today, we were both eating mini pepperoni pizzas.  
  
&  
nbsp; ‚ÄúPizza‚Äôs good,‚Äù I said. He nodded distractedly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNuffing,‚Äù he said through a mouthful of pizza. He swallowed. ‚ÄúI know you think it‚Äôs dumb, but I want to go to prom. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äú1. I do think it‚Äôs dumb; 2. If you want to go, just go; 3. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, you haven‚Äôt even asked anyone. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI asked Cassie Hiney during math. I wrote her a note. ‚Äù I raised my eyebrows questioningly. Ben reached into his shorts and slid a heavily folded piece of paper to me. I flattened it out:  
  
¬† Ben,  
  
¬† I‚Äôd love to go to prom with you, but I‚Äôm already going  
  
¬† with Frank. Sorry!  
  
¬† ‚ÄîC  
  
¬† I refolded it and slid it back across the table. I could remember playing paper football on these tables. ‚ÄúThat sucks,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, whatever. ‚Äù The walls of sound felt like they were closing in on us, and we were silent for a while, and then Ben looked at me very seriously and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get so much play in college. I‚Äôm going to be in the Guinness Book of World Records under the category ‚ÄòMost Honeybunnies Ever Pleased. ‚Äô‚Äù  
  
¬† I laughed. I was thinking about how Radar‚Äôs parents actually were in the Guinness Book when I noticed a pretty African-American girl with spiky little dreads standing above us. It took me a moment to realize that the girl was Angela, Radar‚Äôs I-guess-girlfriend.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said. I‚Äôd had classes with Angela and knew her a little, but we didn‚Äôt say hello in the hallway or anything. I motioned for her to sit. She scooted a chair to the head of the table.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI figure that you guys probably know Marcus better than anyone,‚Äù she said, using Radar‚Äôs real name. She leaned toward us, her elbows on the table.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shitty job, but someone‚Äôs got to do it,‚Äù Ben answered, smiling.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôs, like, embarrassed of me?‚Äù  
  
¬† Ben laughed. ‚ÄúWhat? No,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTechnically,‚Äù I added, ‚Äúyou should be embarrassed of him. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She rolled her eyes, smiling. A girl accustomed to compliments. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs never, like, invited me to hang out with you, though. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOhhhh,‚Äù I said, getting it finally. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he‚Äôs embarrassed of us. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She laughed. ‚ÄúYou seem pretty normal. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never seen Ben snort Sprite up his nose and then spit it out of his mouth,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI look like a demented carbonated fountain,‚Äù he deadpanned.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut really, you wouldn‚Äôt worry? I mean, we‚Äôve been dating for five weeks, and he‚Äôs never even taken me to his house. ‚Äù Ben and I exchanged a knowing glance, and I scrunched up my face to suppress laughter. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHonestly, Angela. If he was forcing you to hang out with us and taking you to his house all the time‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen it would definitely mean he didn‚Äôt like you,‚Äù Ben finished.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre his parents weird?‚Äù  
  
¬† I struggled with how to answer that question honestly. ‚ÄúUh, no. They‚Äôre cool. They‚Äôre just kinda overprotective, I guess. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, overprotective,‚Äù Ben agreed a little too quickly.  
  
¬† She smiled and then got up, saying she had to go say hi to someone before lunch was over. Ben waited until she was gone to say anything. ‚ÄúThat girl is awesome,‚Äù Ben said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúI wonder if we can replace Radar with her. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs probably not that good with computers, though. We need someone who‚Äôs good at computers. Plus I bet she sucks at Resurrection,‚Äù which was our favorite video game. ‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù Ben added, ‚Äúnice call saying that Radar‚Äôs folks are overprotective. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not my place to tell her,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wonder how long till she gets to see the Team Radar Residence and Museum. ‚Äù Ben smiled.  
  
¬† The period was almost over, so Ben and I got up and put our trays onto the conveyer belt. The very same one that Chuck Parson had thrown me onto freshman year, sending me into the terrifying netherworld of Winter Park‚Äôs dishwashing corps. We walked over to Radar‚Äôs locker and were standing there when he raced up just after the first bell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI decided during government that I would actually, literally suck donkey balls if it meant I could skip that class for the rest of the semester,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can learn a lot about government from donkey balls,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHey, speaking of reasons you wish you had fourth-period lunch, we just dined with Angela. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ben smirked at Radar and said, ‚ÄúYeah, she wants to know why she‚Äôs never been over to your house. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Radar exhaled a long breath as he spun the combination to open his locker. He breathed for so long I thought he might pass out. ‚ÄúCrap,‚Äù he said finally.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you embarrassed about something?‚Äù I asked, smiling.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù he answered, poking his elbow into my gut.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou live in a lovely home,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeriously, bro,‚Äù added Ben. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a really nice girl. I don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt introduce her to your parents and show her Casa Radar. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Radar threw his books into his locker and shut it. The din of conversation around us quieted just a bit as he turned his eyes toward the heavens and shouted, ‚ÄúIT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT MY PARENTS OWN THE WORLD‚ÄôS LARGEST COLLECTION OF BLACK SANTAS. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd heard Radar say ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest collection of black Santas‚Äù perhaps a thousand times in my life, and it never became any less funny to me. But he wasn‚Äôt kidding. I remembered the first time I visited. I was maybe thirteen. It was spring, many months past Christmas, and yet black Santas lined the windowsills. Paper cutouts of black Santas hung from the stairway banister. Black Santa candles adorned the dining room table. A black Santa oil painting hung above the mantel, which was itself lined with black Santa figurines. They had a black Santa Pez dispenser purchased from Namibia. The light-up plastic black Santa that stood in their postage-stamp front yard from Thanksgiving to New Year‚Äôs spent the rest of the year proudly keeping watch in the corner of the guest bathroom, a bathroom with homemade black Santa wallpaper created with paint and a Santa-shaped sponge.¬† In every room, save Radar‚Äôs, their home was awash in black Santadom‚Äîplaster and plastic and marble and clay and wood and resin and cloth. In total, Radar‚Äôs parents owned more than twelve hundred black Santas of various sorts. As a plaque beside their front door proclaimed, Radar‚Äôs house was an officially registered Santa Landmark according to the Society for Christmas.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou just gotta tell her, man,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou just gotta say, ‚ÄòAngela, I really like you, but there‚Äôs something you need to know: when we go to my house and hook up, we‚Äôll be watched by the twenty-four hundred eyes of twelve hundred black Santas. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Radar ran a hand through his buzz cut and shook his head. ‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll put it exactly like that, but I‚Äôll deal with it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I headed off to government, Ben to an elective about video game design. I watched clocks through two more classes, and then finally the relief radiated out of my chest when I was finished‚Äî the end of each day like a dry run for our graduation less than a month away.  
  
¬† I went home. I ate two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as an early dinner. I watched poker on TV. My parents came home at six, hugged each other, and hugged me. We ate a macaroni casserole as a proper dinner. They asked me about school. They asked me about prom. They marveled at what a wonderful job they‚Äôd done raising me. They told me about their days dealing with people who had been raised less brilliantly. They went to watch TV. I went to my room to check my email. I wrote a little bit about The Great Gatsby for English. I read some of The Federalist Papers as early prep for my government final. I IM‚Äôed with Ben, and then Radar came online. In our conversation, he used the phrase ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest collection of black Santas‚Äù four times, and I laughed each time. I told him I was happy for him, having a girlfriend. He said it would be a great summer. I agreed. It was May fifth, but it didn‚Äôt have to be. My days had a pleasant identicalness about them. I had always liked that: I liked routine. I liked being bored. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I did. And so May fifth could have been any day‚Äîuntil just before midnight, when Margo Roth Spiegelman slid open my screenless bedroom window for the first time since telling me to close it nine years before.  
  
¬† 2.  
  
¬† I swiveled around when I heard the window open, and Margo‚Äôs blue eyes were staring back at me. Her eyes were all I could see at first, but as my vision adjusted, I realized she was wearing black face paint and a black hoodie. ‚ÄúAre you having cybersex?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm IM‚Äôing with Ben Starling. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt answer my question, perv. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I laughed awkwardly, then walked over and knelt by the window, my face inches from hers. I couldn‚Äôt imagine why she was here, in my window, like this. ‚ÄúTo what do I owe the pleasure?‚Äù I asked. Margo and I were still friendly, I guess, but we weren‚Äôt meet-in-the-dead-of-night-wearing-black-face-paint friendly. She had friends for that, I‚Äôm sure. I just wasn‚Äôt among them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need your car,‚Äù she explained.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a car,‚Äù I said, which was something of a sore point for me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, I need your mom‚Äôs car. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have your own car,‚Äù I pointed out.  
  
¬† Margo puffed out her cheeks and sighed. ‚ÄúRight, but the thing is that my parents have taken the keys to my car and locked them inside a safe, which they put under their bed, and Myrna Mount-weazel‚Äù‚Äî who was her dog‚Äî‚Äúis sleeping inside their room. And Myrna Mountweazel has a freaking aneurysm whenever she catches sight of me. I mean, I could totally sneak in there and steal the safe and crack it and get my keys out and drive away, but the thing is that it‚Äôs not even worth trying because Myrna Mountweazel is just going to bark like crazy if I so much as crack open the door. So like I said, I need a car. Also, I need you to drive it, because I have to do eleven things tonight, and at least five of them involve a getaway man. ‚Äù  
  
¬† When I let my sight unfocus, she became nothing but eyes, floating in the ether. And then I locked back on her, and I could see the outline of her face, the paint still wet against her skin. Her cheekbones triangulating into her chin, her pitch-black lips barely turned to a smile. ‚ÄúAny felonies?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù said Margo. ‚ÄúRemind me if breaking and entering is a felony. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I answered firmly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not a felony or no you won‚Äôt help?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo I won‚Äôt help. Can‚Äôt you enlist some of your underlings to drive you around?‚Äù Lacey and/or Becca were always doing her bidding.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre part of the problem, actually,‚Äù Margo said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere are eleven problems,‚Äù she said somewhat impatiently.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo felonies,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI swear to God that you will not be asked to commit a felony. ‚Äù  
  
¬† And right then, the floodlights came on all around Margo‚Äôs house. In one swift motion, she somersaulted through my window, into my room, and then rolled beneath my bed. Within seconds, her dad was standing on the patio outside. ‚ÄúMargo!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúI saw you!‚Äù  
  
¬† From beneath my bed, I heard a muffled, ‚ÄúOh, Christ. ‚Äù Margo scooted out from under the bed, stood up, walked to the window, and said, ‚ÄúCome on, Dad. I‚Äôm just trying to have a chat with Quentin. You‚Äôre always telling me what a fantastic influence he could be on me and everything. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust chatting with Quentin?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen why are you wearing black face paint?‚Äù  
  
¬† Margo faltered for only the briefest moment. ‚ÄúDad, to answer that question would take hours of backstory, and I know that you‚Äôre probably very tired, so just go back t‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn the house,‚Äù he thundered. ‚ÄúThis minute!‚Äù  
  
¬† Margo grabbed hold of my shirt, whispered, ‚ÄúBack in a minute,‚Äù in my ear, and then climbed out the window.  
  
¬† As soon as she left, I grabbed my car keys from my desk. The keys are mine; the car, tragically, is not. On my sixteenth birthday, my parents gave me a very small gift, and I knew the moment they handed it to me that it was a car key, and I about peed myself, because they‚Äôd said over and over again that they couldn‚Äôt afford to give me a car. But when they handed me the tiny wrapped box, I knew they‚Äôd been tricking me, that I was getting a car after all. I tore off the wrapping paper and popped open the little box. Indeed, it contained a key.  
  
¬† Upon close inspection, it contained a Chrysler key. A key for a Chrysler minivan. The one and the same Chrysler minivan owned by my mother.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy present is a key to your car?‚Äù I asked my mom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTom,‚Äù she said to my dad, ‚ÄúI told you he would get his hopes up. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt blame me,‚Äù my dad said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just sublimating your own frustration with my income. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that snap analysis a tad passive-aggressive?‚Äù my mother asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt rhetorical accusations of passive aggression inherently passive-aggressive?‚Äù my dad responded, and they went on like that for a while.  
  
¬† The long and short of it was this: I had access to the vehicular awesomeness that is a late-model Chrysler minivan, except for when my mom was driving it. And since she drove to work every morning, I could only use the car on weekends. Well, weekends and the middle of the goddamned night.  
  
¬† It took Margo more than the promised minute to return to my window, but not much more. But in the time she was gone, I‚Äôd started to waffle again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got school tomorrow,‚Äù I told her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I know,‚Äù Margo answered. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs school tomorrow and the day after that, and thinking about that too long could make a girl bonkers. So, yeah. It‚Äôs a school night. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve got to get going, because we‚Äôve got to be back by morning. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúQ,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúQ. Darling. How long have we been dear friends?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not friends. We‚Äôre neighbors. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Christ, Q. Am I not nice to you? Do I not order my various and sundry minions to be kin  
d to you at school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù I answered dubiously, although in point of fact I‚Äôd always figured it was Margo who had stopped Chuck Parson and his ilk from screwing with us.  
  
¬† She blinked. She‚Äôd even painted her eyelids. ‚ÄúQ,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwe have to go. ‚Äù  
  
¬† And so I went. I slid out the window, and we ran along the side of my house, heads down, until we opened the doors of the minivan. Margo whispered not to close the doors‚Äîtoo much noise‚Äîso with the doors open, I put it in neutral, pushed off the cement with my foot, and then let the minivan roll down the driveway. We rolled slowly past a couple houses before I turned on the engine and the headlights. We closed the doors, and then I drove through the serpentine streets of Jefferson Park‚Äôs endlessness, the houses all still new-looking and plastic, like a toy village housing tens of thousands of real people.

He‚Äôs declining quick , frequently falling, got hurt so bad last week he got a concussion and had to go to the er and nursing home for a couple weeks. He‚Äôs back home but it‚Äôs hard on everyone, he can‚Äôt walk. He barely communicates now he does but he looks confused and sad. He‚Äôs also dealing with cancer may I add. Myself and my family are devastated. He takes forever to eat now, having trouble swallowing pills and chokes. What can we do to make it easier for him? So he‚Äôs not just watching tv all day or sleeping. My heart breaks and I really hate seeing him this way considering at the beginning of the year he wasn‚Äôt this bad. And unfortunately he can only get a caregiver 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and he need continuous care, like getting help for getting ready for bed is the most difficult but he doesn‚Äôt want to be in a nursing home understandably so. Unsure what to do, but I wish I knew. 

I miss watching him make his coffee in the morning or his jimmy dean breakfast sandwich. Or watching him laugh and joke with us cause he was always quite the jokester. Or sneak to the kitchen for a sweet. I miss being able to stand up and hug him. Dementia sucks üòû",5,1753245316.0,dementia,0,1.0,False
1m6zz4b,https://i.redd.it/7z9lfvxdyjef1.jpeg,all of them are work related,"rant/vent

reason 1: my coworker ‚ÄûBob‚Äú, who uses the fact that I‚Äòm an apprentice and he isn‚Äòt as an excuse to order me around and to make me do tasks he‚Äòs too damn lazy for, but at the same time not teaching me shit and getting irritated when I ask questions because ‚Äûyou should know that by now‚Äú. how am I supposed to know this if HE doesn‚Äòt teach me anything about his area of expertise???? and then he borrows equipment from work without getting our boss‚Äòs permission and leaves it for me to put away. plus he gives me a 10 minute speech on ‚Äûdon‚Äòt damage the equipment you‚Äòre borrowing‚Äú (I borrowed some the same weekend) as if I weren‚Äòt extra careful with things that don‚Äòt belong to me. does he really think I *want* to face the shame and embarrassment of telling my boss that I broke something worth 10k?

reason 2: my boss is stressed out and takes it out on us. appearantly being at work by 7:30 is too late when the clients are going to need my help for 5 minutes at 8am, and things get going by 9am. ‚Äûwhat if something goes wrong?‚Äú well if something does go wrong, either an hour is plenty enough to fix it or it‚Äòll need at least half a day and we have to find some temporary solution anyway. srsly. the service this week‚Äòs clients need is neither complex, nor is the equipment used prone to not working. it‚Äòs literally the handful of things almost nothing can go wrong with.

which brings us to reason 3: a shift in my morning schedule. in the morning, I‚Äòm like a clockwork. to arrive at work by 7:30, I get up at 4:45. by 5:15 I‚Äòm on my couch enjoying my cup of coffee, and at 5:45 I start getting ready. 6:15 I‚Äòm out of the door to catch my bus.

now either I take the first bus, which matches my schedule closely enough to be okay, but then I‚Äòd need to get up at 3:45! or I take the second bus, which kinda flips my schedule upside down (literally, if you go by the hands of my clock - they‚Äòre on the wrong side of the clock and I HATE it), but it‚Äòs not leave by 5:45 because then I‚Äòd need to wait at the bus stop for 10 minutes. I also need to change trains at different stops because otherwise I wouldn‚Äòt have enough time, which means I don‚Äòt get to get a cup of coffee at the train station bakery.

gods, I wish I could work 30 hours a week. but as long as I‚Äòm an apprentice I have no chance, and I would like to earn more money than now once I‚Äòm fully trained. besides my boss is a workaholic and thinks burnout is ‚Äûthe young generation is lazy! back in my day..!‚Äú

well back in your day mentally ill people were even more fucked than we are today. I have plenty enough ancestors who were buried outside the church graveyard, if you catch my drift.

at least I‚Äòm taking the remaining 4/5 weeks of pto in August. I can‚Äòt wait.",89,1753245289.0,aspiememes,1,1.0,False

¬†  
  
¬† Parents had some kind of sin radar, Claire thought. They always called when you were in the middle of something you just knew they'd consider wrong. Or at least risky.  
  
¬† Claire Danvers slid off of her boyfriend Shane's lap with a regretful sigh, licked her damp, tingling lips, and went to answer the ringing phone in the kitchen. Michael was just getting up from the table to grab it, but Claire waved him off. She just knew it would be her mother.  
  
¬† She was right.  
  
¬† ""Claire! Oh my goodness, I've been worried sick, honey. We've been trying to call you on your cell for days, and -- ""  
  
¬† Crap. Claire rubbed her forehead in frustration. ""Mom, I wrote you guys an email, remember? My cell got lost, I'm still working on getting another one. "" Best not to mention how it had gotten lost. Best not to mention anything about how dangerous her life had gotten since she'd moved to Morganville, Texas.  
  
¬† ""Oh,"" Mom said, and then, more slowly, ""oh. Well, your father forgot to tell me about that. You know, he's the one who checks the email. I don't like computers. ""  
  
¬† ""Yes, Mom, I know. "" Mom really wasn't that bad, but she was notoriously nervous with computers, and for good reason; they had a tendency to short out around her.  
  
¬† Mom was still talking. ""Is everything going all right? How are classes? Interesting?""  
  
¬† Claire opened the refrigerator door and retrieved a red can of Coke, which she popped open and chugged to give herself time to think what, if anything to tell her parents. Mom, there was a little trouble. See, my boyfriend's dad came to town with some bikers and killed people, and nearly killed us too. Oh, and the vampires are angry about it. And so to save my friends, I had to sign a contract, so now I'm basically the slave of the most bad-ass vampire in town.  
  
¬† Yeah, that wouldn't go over well.  
  
¬† Besides, even if she said it, Mom wouldn't understand it. Mom had been to Morganville, but she hadn't really seen. People didn't. And if they did, they either never left town, or had their memories wiped on the way out.  
  
¬† And if by some chance they started to remember, bad things could happen to them. Terminally bad things.  
  
¬† So instead, Claire said, ""Classes are great, Mom. I aced all my exams last week. ""  
  
¬† ""Of course you did. Don't you always?""  
  
¬† Yeah, but last week I had to take my exams while worrying if somebody was going to stick a knife in my back. It could have had an effect on my GPA. Stupid to be proud of that . . . ""Everything's fine here. I'll let you know when I get the new cell phone, okay?"" Claire hesitated, then asked, ""How are you? How's Dad?""  
  
¬† ""Oh, we're fine, honey. We miss you is all. But your father's still not happy about you living in that place, off campus, with those older kids -- ""  
  
¬† Of all the things for Mom to remember, she had to remember that. And of course Claire couldn't tell her why she was living off campus with eighteen-year-olds, especially when two of them were boys. Mom hadn't gotten around to mentioning the boys yet, but it was just a matter of time.  
  
¬† ""Mom, I told you how mean the girls were to me in the dorm. It's better here, really. They're my friends. And really, they're great. ""  
  
¬† Mom didn't sound too convinced. ""You're being careful, though. About those boys. ""  
  
¬† Well, that hadn't taken long. ""Yes, I'm being careful about the boys. "" She was even being careful about Shane, though that was mostly because Shane never forgot that Claire was not-quite-seventeen, and he was not-quite-nineteen. Not a huge age difference, but legally? Huger than huge, if her parents got upset about it. Which they definitely would. ""Everybody here says hello, by the way. Ah, Michael's waving. ""  
  
¬† Michael Glass, the second boy in the house, had settled down at the kitchen table and was reading a newspaper, looked up and gave her a wide-eyed no-you-don't shake of his head. He'd had a bad enough time of it with her parents the last time, and now . . . well, things were even worse, if that was possible. At least when he'd met them, Michael had been half-normal: fully human by night, an incorporeal ghost by day, and trapped in the house twenty-four/seven.  
  
¬† For Morganville, that was half-normal.  
  
¬† In order to help get Shane out of trouble, Michael had made a terrible choice -- he'd gained his freedom from the house, and gotten physical form all the time, but now he was a vampire. Claire couldn't tell if it bothered him. It had to, right? But he seemed so . . . normal.  
  
¬† Maybe a little too normal.  
  
¬† Claire listened to her mother's voice, and then held out the phone to Michael. ""She wants to talk to you,"" she said.  
  
¬† ""No! I'm not here!"" He stage-whispered and made waving-off motions. Claire wiggled the phone insistently.  
  
¬† ""You're the responsible one,"" she reminded him. ""Just try not to talk about the - "" She mimed fangs in the neck.  
  
¬† Michael shot her a dirty look, took the phone, and turned on the charm. He had a lot of it, Claire knew; it wasn't just parents who liked him, it was . . . well, everybody. Michael was smart, cute, hot, talented, respectful . . . nothing not to love, except the whole undead aspect. He assured her mother that everything was fine, that Claire was behaving herself -- his eyeroll made Claire snort cola up her nose --and that he was watching out for Mrs. Danvers's little girl. That last part was true, at least. Michael was taking his self-appointed older brother duties way too seriously. He hardly let Claire out of his sight, except when privacy was required or Claire slipped off to class without an escort -- which was as often as possible.  
  
¬† ""Yes ma'am,"" Michael said. He was starting to look a little strained. ""No ma'am. I won't let her do that. Yes. Yes. ""  
  
¬† Claire had pity on him, and reclaimed the phone. ""Mom, we've got to go. I love you both. ""  
  
¬† Mom still sounded anxious. ""Claire, are you sure you don't want to come home? Maybe I was wrong about letting you go to MIT early. You could take the year off, study, and we'd love to have you back home again . . . ""  
  
¬† Weird. Usually she calmed right down, especially when Michael talked to her. Claire had a bad flash of Shane telling her about his own mother, how her memories of Morganville had started to surface. How the vampires had come after her to kill her because the conditioning didn't stick.  
  
¬† Her parents were in the same boat now. They'd been to town, but she still wasn't sure just how much they really knew or understood about that visit -- it could be enough to put them in mortal danger. She had to do everything she could to keep them safe. That meant not following her dreams to MIT, because if she left Morganville --assuming she could even get out of town at all -- the vampires would follow her, and they'd either bring her back or kill her. And the rest of her family, too.  
  
¬† Besides, Claire had to stay now, because she'd signed a contract pledging herself directly to Amelie, the town's Founder. The biggest, scariest vampire of them all, even if she rarely showed that side. At the time, she'd been Claire's only real hope to keep herself and her friends alive.  
  
¬† So far signing the contract hadn't meant a whole lot -- no announcements in the local paper, Amelie hadn't shown up to collect on her soul or anything. So maybe it would just pass by . . . quietly.  
  
¬† Mom was still talking about MIT, and Claire didn't want to think about it. She'd dreamed of going to a school like MIT or CalTech her whole life, and she'd been smart enough to do it. She'd even gotten early acceptance. It was drastically unfair that she was stuck in Morganville now, like a fly in a spider's web, and for a few seconds she let herself feel bitter and angry about that.  
  
¬† Nice, the brutally honest part of her mocked. You'd sacrifice Shane's life for what you want, because you know that's what would happen. Eventually, the vampires would find an excuse to kill him. You're not any better than the vampires if you don't do everything you can to prevent that.  
  
¬† The bitterness left, but regret wasn't f  
ollowing any time soon. She hoped Shane never knew how she felt about it, deep down.  
  
¬† ""Mom, sorry, I've got to go, I have class. I love you -- tell Dad I love him too, will you?""  
  
¬† Claire hung up on her mother's protests, heaved a sigh, and looked at Michael. Who was looking a little sympathetic.  
  
¬† ""That's not easy, talking to the folks,"" he offered. ""Sorry. ""  
  
¬† ""Don't you ever talk to your parents?"" Claire asked, and slid into the chair at the small breakfast table across from him. Michael had a cup of something; she was afraid it was blood for a second, but then she smelled coffee. Hazelnut. Vampires could, and did, enjoy food; it just didn't sustain them.  
  
¬† Michael looked suspiciously good this morning -- a little color in his face, an energy to his movements that hadn't been there last night.  
  
¬† He'd had more than coffee this morning.  
  
¬† ""Yeah, I call my folks sometimes,"" Michael said. He folded the newspaper -- the local rag, run by vampires -- and picked up a smaller, rolled bundle of letter-sized pages secured by a rubber band. ""They're Morganville exiles, so they have a lot to forget. It's better if I don't keep in contact too much, it could make trouble. I mostly write. The mail and email gets read before it goes on, you know that, right? And most of the phone calls get monitored, especially long distance. ""  
  
¬† He stripped off the rubber band and unfolded the cheap pages of the second newspaper. Claire read the masthead upside down: The Fang Report. The logo was two stakes at right angles making up a cross. Wild.  
  
¬† ""What's that?""  
  
¬† ""This?"" Michael rattled the paper and shrugged. ""Captain Obvious. ""  
  
¬† ""What?""  
  
¬† ""Captain Obvious. That's his handle. He's been doing these papers every week for about two years now. It's an underground thing. ""  
  
¬† Underground in Morganville had a lot of meanings. Claire raised her eyebrows. ""So . . . Captain Obvious is a vampire?""  
  
¬† ""Not unless he's got a serious self-image problem,"" Michael said. ""Captain Obvious hates vampires. If somebody steps out of line, he documents it -- "" Michael froze, reading the headline, and his mouth opened, then closed. His face set like stone, and his blue eyes looked stricken.  
  
¬† Claire reached over and took the newspaper from his hands, turned it, and read.  
  
¬† NEW BLOODSUCKER IN TOWN  
  
¬† Michael Glass, once a rising musical star with too much talent for this twisted town, has fallen to the Dark Side. Details are sketchy, but Glass, who's been keeping to himself for the past year, has definitely joined the Fang Gang. Nobody knows how or where it happened, and I doubt Glass will be talking, but we should all be worried: does this mean more vamps, fewer humans? After all, he is the first newly risen undead in generations.  
  
¬† Beware, boys and girls: Glass may look like an angel, but he's got a demon inside now. Memorize the face, kibbles. He's the newest addition to the Better Off Dead club!  
  
¬† ""The Better Off Dead club?"" Claire repeated aloud, horrified. ""He's kidding, right?"" There was Michael's picture, probably right out of the Morganville High yearbook, inset as a graphic into a tombstone.  
  
¬† With crudely drawn-in fangs.  
  
¬† ""Captain Obvious never comes out and tells anyone to kill,"" Michael said. ""He's pretty careful about how he phrases things. "" Her friend was angry, Claire saw. And scared. ""He's got our address listed. And all your names, too, though he at least he points out none of you are really vampires. Jesus. That's not good. "" Michael was getting past the shock of seeing himself outed in the paper, and was getting worried. Claire was already there.  
  
¬† ""Well . . . why don't the vampires do something about him? Stop him?""  
  
¬† ""They've tried. They've arrested three people in the last two years and said they were Captain Obvious. Turned out they didn't know anything. The Captain could teach the CIA a thing or two about running a secret operation. ""  
  
¬† ""So he's not that obvious,"" Claire said.  
  
¬† ""I think he means it in the ironic sense. "" Michael swallowed a quick gulp of coffee. ""Claire, I don't like this. Not like we didn't have enough trouble without this kind of -- ""  
  
¬† Eve slammed in the kitchen door, which hit the wall with a thunderous boom, startling both of them. She clomped across the kitchen floor, and leaned on the breakfast table. She wasn't very Goth today; her hair was still matte-block, but it was worn back in a simple ponytail, and the plain knit shirt and black pants didn't have a skull anywhere in view. No makeup, either. She almost looked . . . normal. Which was so wrong.  
  
¬† ""All right,"" she said, and slapped down a second copy of The Fang Report in front of Michael. ""Please tell me you have a snappy comeback for this. ""  
  
¬† ""I'll make sure the three of you are safe. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh, so not what I was looking for! Look, I'm not worried about us! We're not the ones Photoshopped into tombstones!"" Eve looked at the picture again. ""Although yes, better dead than that hairdo . . . God, was that your prom photo?""  
  
¬† Michael grabbed the paper back and put it face down on the table. ""Eve, nothing is going to happen. Captain Obvious just loves to talk. Nobody's going to come after me. ""  
  
¬† ""Right,"" a new voice said. It was Shane. He'd come in behind Eve, clearly wanting to watch the fireworks, and now he leaned against the wall next to the stove and crossed his arms. ""By all means, let's keep on shoveling the bull,"" he said. ""It's trouble, and you know it. "" Claire waited for him to come over to the table and join the three of them, the way things used to be.  
  
¬† He didn't. He crossed his arms. Shane hadn't willingly stayed long in the same room with Michael since . . . the change. And he wouldn't look at him, except in angles and side glances. He'd also taken to wearing one of Eve's silver crosses, although just now it was hidden beneath the neck of the gray t-shirt he was wearing. Claire found her eyes fixing on the just-visible outline of it.  
  
¬† Eve ignored Shane; her big, dark eyes were fixed on Michael. ""You know they'll all be gunning for you now, right? All the would-be Buffys?"" Claire had seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she had no idea how Eve had managed; it was contraband in Morganville, along with every other movie or book featuring vampires. Or vampire-killing, more to the point. Internet downloads were strictly controlled, too, though no doubt there was a hot black market in those kinds of things that Eve was tapped into.  
  
¬† ""Like you?"" Michael said. He still hadn't forgotten the arsenal of stakes and crosses that Eve kept hidden in her room. In the old days, that had seemed like good sense, living in Morganville. Now, it seemed like a recipe for domestic violence.  
  
¬† Eve looked stricken. ""I'd never -- ""  
  
¬† ""I know. "" He took her hand gently in his. ""I know. ""  
  
¬† She softened, but then she shook it off and went back to frowning at him. ""Look, this is dangerous. They know you're an easier target than those other guys, and they're going to hate you even worse, because you're one of us. Our age. ""  
  
¬† ""Maybe,"" Michael said. ""Eve, come on, sit. Sit down. ""  
  
¬† She did, but it was more like a collapse, and she didn't stop jittering her heel up and down in agitation, or drumming her black-painted fingernails on the table. ""This is bad,"" she said. ""You know that, right? Nine point five on the ten point scale of make-me-yak. ""  
  
¬† ""Compared to what?"" Shane asked. ""We're already living with the enemy. What does that score? Not to mention you probably get extra points for banging him -- ""  
  
¬† Michael stood up so fast his chair tipped and hit the floor with a clatter. Shane straightened up, ready for trouble, fists clenched.  
  
¬† ""Shut up, Shane,"" Michael said, deathly quiet. ""I mean it. ""  
  
¬† Shane stared past him at Eve. ""He's going to bite you. He can't help it, and once he starts, he won't stop, he'll kill you. But you know that, right? What is that, some freak-ass Goth idea of romantic suicide? You turning into a fang-banger?""  
  
¬† ""Butt out, Shane. What you know about Goth culture, you got from old episodes of The Munsters and your Aryan Brotherhood dad. "" Great, now Eve was angry, too. That left Claire the only sane one in the room.  
  
¬† Michael made an effort to dial it  
back. ""Come on, Shane. Leave her alone. You're the one hurting her, not me. ""  
  
¬† Shane's gaze snapped to Michael and focused. Hard. ""I don't hurt girls. You say I do, and you'd better back it up, asshole. ""  
  
¬† Shane pushed away from the wall, because Michael was taking steps in his direction. Claire watched, wide-eyed and frozen.  
  
¬† Eve got between them, hands outstretched to hold both of them back. ""Come on, guys, you don't want to do this. ""  
  
¬† ""Kinda do,"" Shane said coolly.  
  
¬† ""Fine. Either hit each other or get a room,"" she snapped, and stepped out of the middle. ""Just don't pretend it's all about protecting the itty widdle girl, because it isn't. It's about the two of you. So get it together, or leave, I don't care which. ""  
  
¬† Shane stared at her for a second, eyes gone wide and oddly hurt, then looked at Claire. She didn't move.  
  
¬† ""I'm out,"" he said. He turned and walked out through the kitchen door. It swung shut behind him.  
  
¬† Eve let out a little gasp. ""I didn't think he'd go,"" she said, so unsteadily that for a second Claire thought she was going to cry. ""What a freaking idiot. ""  
  
¬† Claire reached over and took her hand. Eve squeezed, hard, and then leaned back into Michael's embrace. Vampire or not, the two of them seemed happy, and anyway, this was Michael. She just couldn't understand Shane's anger. It seemed to bubble up when she least expected it, for no reason at all.  
  
¬† ""I'd better -- "" she ventured. Michael nodded.  
  
¬† Claire slipped out of her chair and went to find Shane. Not like it was difficult; he was slumped on the couch, staring at the Playstation screen and working the controls on yet another zombie-killing adventure. ""You taking his side?"" Shane asked, and splattered the head of an attacking undead monster.  
  
¬† ""No,"" Claire said, and settled in carefully next to him, with enough open space between so he didn't feel pressured. ""Why are there sides, anyway?""  
  
¬† ""What?""  
  
¬† ""Michael's your friend, he's our housemate. Why do there have to be sides?""  
  
¬† He snapped his fingers. ""Um, wait, I've got this one . . . because he's a bloodsucking, night-crawling leech who used to be my friend?""  
  
¬† ""Shane -- ""  
  
¬† ""You think you know, but you don't. He's going to change. They all change. Maybe it'll take time, I don't know. Right now, he thinks he's just human plus, but that's not what it is. He's human minus. And you'd better not forget it. ""  
  
¬† She stared at him, a little bit stunned and a whole lot saddened. ""Eve's right. That sounds like your father talking. ""  
  
¬† Shane flinched, paused the game, and threw the controller down. ""Low, Claire. "" He wasn't exactly his dad's biggest fan at the best of times -- he couldn't be, the number of cruel things his dad had done to him.  
  
¬† ""No, it's just true. Look, it's Michael. Can't you give him the benefit of the doubt? He hasn't hurt anybody, has he? And you have to admit, having a vampire on our side, really on our side, couldn't hurt. Not in Morganville. ""  
  
¬† He just glared at the screen, jaw set like stone. Claire was trying to think of another way to get through to him, but she was derailed by the ringing of the doorbell. Shane didn't move. ""I'll get it,"" she sighed, and went down the hall to open the front door. It was safe enough -- mid-morning, sunny, and relatively mild. Summer was finally starting a slide toward fall, now that it had burned all the green out of the Texas landscape.  
  
¬† Claire squinted against the brilliance. For a second she thought that there was something deeply wrong with her eyes.  
  
¬† Because her arch-enemy and Queen Bitch Monica Morrell, flanked by her ever-present harpies Gina and Jennifer, were standing on the doorstep. It was like seeing Barbie and her friends, blown up life size and dressed like Old Navy mannequins. Tanned, toned and perfect, from lip gloss to toenail polish. Monica had forced on a determinedly pleasant expression. Gina and Jennifer were also trying, but looked more like they were smelling something rotten.  
  
¬† ""Hi!"" Monica said brightly. ""Got plans today, Claire? I was thinking we could hang. ""  
  
¬† That's it, Claire thought. I'm dreaming. Only this is a nightmare, right? Monica pretending to be my friend? Definitely a nightmare.  
  
¬† ""I -- what do you want?"" Because Claire's relationship with Monica, Gina and Jennifer had started with being pushed down stairs at the dorm, and hadn't improved since. She was a crawling bug, to the Cool Girls. At best. Or . . . a tool. Was this about Michael? Because his status had changed from ""hermit musician"" to ""hottie vampire"" in one night, and Monica was definitely a fang-banger, right? ""You want to talk to Michael?""  
  
¬† Monica gave her an odd look. ""Why would I want to do that? Can he go shopping in broad daylight?""  
  
¬† ""Oh. "" She had no idea what else to say to that.  
  
¬† ""I thought a little retail therapy, and then we can all go study,"" Monica said. ""We're going to check out that new place, not Common Grounds. Common Grounds is so last century. Like I want to be under Oliver's thumb all the time. Now that he's taken over as Protector for our family, he's been all hands-on, wanting to see my grades. Sucks, right?""  
  
¬† ""I -- ""  
  
¬† ""C'mon, save my life. I really need help with Economics, and these two are boneheads. "" Monica dismissed her two closest friends with an offhand wave. ""Seriously. Come with us. Please? I could really use your brainpower. And I think we should get to know each other a little better, don't you? Seeing as how things have changed?""  
  
¬† Claire opened her mouth, then closed it without saying anything. The last two times she'd gone anywhere with Monica, she'd been flat on her back on the floor of a van, getting beaten and terrorized.  
  
¬† She managed to stammer, ""I know this is going to sound rude, but --what the hell are you doing?""  
  
¬† Monica sighed and looked -- how weird was this? -- contrite. ""I know what you're thinking. Yes, I was a bitch to you, and I hurt you. And I'm sorry. "" Gina and Jennifer, her constant Greek chorus, nodded and repeated sorry in whispers. ""Water under the bridge, all right? All is forgiven?""  
  
¬† Claire was, if anything, even more mystified. ""Why are you doing this?""  
  
¬† Monica pursed her glossy lips, leaned forward, and dropped her voice to a low, confidential tone. ""Well . . . all right, yeah, it's not like I had a head injury or something and woke up thinking you were cool. But you're different now. I can help. I can introduce you around to all the people you really need to know. ""  
  
¬† ""You're kidding. I'm different how?""  
  
¬† Monica leaned even closer. ""You signed. ""  
  
¬† So . . . this wasn't about Michael. Claire had just become . . . popular. Because she'd become Amelie's property.  
  
¬† And that was terrifying.  
  
¬† ""Oh,"" she managed, and then, more slowly, ""Oh. ""  
  
¬† ""Trust me,"" Monica said. ""You need somebody in the know. Somebody to show you the ropes. ""  
  
¬† If the only other person left on the planet was Jack the Ripper, Claire would have trusted him first. ""Sorry,"" she said. ""I have plans. But -- thank you. Maybe some other time. ""  
  
¬† She shut the door on Monica's surprised face, then locked it. She jumped when she turned to find Shane standing right behind her, staring at her like he'd never seen her before.  
  
¬† ""Thank you?"" he mimicked. ""You're thanking that bitch? For what, Claire? For beating you? For trying to kill you? For killing my sister? Christ. First Michael, then you. I don't know any of you anymore. ""  
  
¬† In true Shane fashion, he just took off. She listened to the heavy tread of his footsteps cross the living room and travel up the stairs. Heard the familiar slam of his door.  
  
¬† ""Hey!"" she shouted after him. ""I was just being polite!""Chapter Two  
  
¬†  
  
¬† ""So,"" Eve asked as she drove Claire to school, ""what was up with the Monica thing? I mean, maybe you ought to watch your back with her. Even more than you already do. ""  
  
¬† ""She sounded like she really kind of meant it. It took a lot for her to come eat crow like that. ""  
  
¬† Eve shot her a look. One of those looks, doubly effective coming from a girl wearing rice-powder makeup and flawless eye liner and black cherry lips. ""In Monica's world, being friends means doing whatever Monica wants, when Monica wants to do it. Somehow, I can't see you as one of her brain-dead backup singers. ""  
  
¬† ""No! That's not -- I didn't say I was going to be her friend, just -- you asked. "" Claire crossed her arms and settled back in the bucket seat of Eve's ancient black Caddy, shooting for a stubborn look. ""She's not my friend, okay? You're my friend. ""  
  
¬† ""So when Monica starts bringing the in-crowd to hang at your study table, you'll get up and leave? No way. You're too nice. Before you know it, you're tagging along with them, and then you start to actually feel sorry for them. You'll tell me how Monica's not bad, she's just misunderstood, and before you know it you're braiding each others' hair and giggling over boy bands. ""  
  
¬† Claire made a retching sound. ""I wouldn't do that. ""  
  
¬† ""Please. You like everybody. You even like me. You like Shane, and let's face it, Shane's kind of an idiot, at least right now. "" Eve's eyes narrowed as she thought about that. ""And about Shane, I swear, if he doesn't snap out of it I'm going to punch him in the face. Well, punch him in the face and then run like hell. ""  
  
¬† Claire played that out in her head, and nearly laughed. Eve's best possible punch wouldn't do more than surprise Shane, she figured, but she could just picture the wounded look of confusion on his face. What the hell did I do?  
  
¬† ""I'm not popular,"" she declared. ""Monica's not my friend, and I'm not hanging with her, ever, end of story. ""  
  
¬† ""Swear?""  
  
¬† Claire held up her hand. ""Swear. ""  
  
¬† ""Huh. "" Eve didn't sound convinced. ""Whatev. ""  
  
¬† ""Look, if we're friends, how about buying me a mocha?""  
  
¬† ""Mooch. ""  
  
¬† ""You're the one with the job. ""  
  
¬† \###  
  
¬† Mid-afternoon, and it was raining, which was kind of a rarity -- a cold early fall rain that came down in glittering sheets. Claire, like about ninety percent of the other students, hadn't thought to bring an umbrella, so she sloshed along miserably along the Quadrangle, past the empty benches and rain-soaked message boards, toward her Chem Lab. She loved Chem Lab. She hated rain. She hated being soaked to the skin and frankly, living in this part of Texas, it wasn't usually that much of a risk. There was no room in her backpack for anything frivolous, like a raincoat. She worried her books were getting soggy, but the backpack was supposed to be waterproof . . .  
  
¬† ""You look cold,"" said a voice from behind her, and then the cold rain cut off, and she heard the hollow thump of raindrops hitting the thin skin of an umbrella. Claire looked up, blinked water out of her eyes, and saw she was walking under a golf umbrella big enough for four or five of her . . . or one of her, plus the guy holding the umbrella. Because he was huge. Also, cute, in that big-boned football player kind of way. He would have made Shane look small. Well-proportioned, though, so the height (had to be at least 6'5"", Claire thought) and weight just seemed right on him. He had chocolate-brown skin and gorgeous brown eyes, and he seemed . . . kind of nice.  
  
¬† ""I'm Jerome,"" he said. ""Hey. ""  
  
¬† ""Hey,"" she said back, still amazed that somebody who was clearly somebody would stop to hang an umbrella over her head. ""Thanks. Um, I'm Claire. Hi. ""  
  
¬† She juggled her dripping backpack to her other hand and offered him her right. He took it and shook. His was about three times as large, big enough (she bet) to cup most of an entire football.  
  
¬† He was wearing a TPU athletic department t-shirt. No mystery about his major.  
  
¬† ""Where you heading, Claire?""  
  
¬† ""Chem Lab,"" she said, and pointed at the building, which was about a football field length away, on the other side of the Quad. He nodded and steered that direction. ""Look, it's nice of you, but you don't have to -- ""  
  
¬† ""It's no problem. "" He smiled at her. He had dimples. ""I hear the ScienceBuilding is nice this time of year. And anything for a friend. ""  
  
¬† ""But I'm not -- ""  
  
¬† Jerome nodded to a group of girls standing huddled together under the awning of the Language Arts building. Pretty girls. In the center of them was Monica Morrell, and she blew Jerome a flirty sort of kiss.  
  
¬† ""Oh,"" Claire said. ""That friend. "" Her estimate of Jerome fell by several dozen notches, hit bottom, and started digging for China. ""Look, I appreciate it, but I'm not sugar. I won't melt. ""  
  
¬† She veered away and walked fast. Jerome took about two long strides and put the umbrella over her again without comment. She glared at him.  
  
¬† He lifted an eyebrow. ""I can play this game this all day. ""  
  
¬† ""Fine,"" she said. ""But I don't need favors from Monica. ""  
  
¬† ""Girl, it's an umbrella, not a Lamborghini,"" he pointed out. Way too reasonably. ""I'm not even lending it to you. It's not really that much of a favor. ""  
  
¬† She kept her mouth shut, head down, and walked fast. Jerome stopped at the foot of the Science Building's stairs, and she bounded up and darted under the concrete porch, which was already choked with other students hiding from the rain. She looked back down. Jerome smiled and waved, and a bronze or copper bracelet caught her eye.  
  
¬† He was Protected. Probably a native of Morganville.  
  
¬† ""I'm not her friend. That was not my fault,"" she complained, defending herself to an Eve who wasn't even there.  
  
¬† And then she sneezed, sniffled, and dragged her soggy butt to class.  
  
¬† \###  
  
¬† The rain kept up all day and all night, but the next day dawned bright and shiny, with a pale silver sun not quite as fierce as Claire expected. Kind of nice, actually. She'd already showered by the time Eve stumbled into the bathroom, looking more like the walking dead than most vampires, mumbled something, and ignored Claire as she started up the shower again. Claire finished at the sink and hurried down the stairs. She found Michael at the coffeepot, emptying the filter of cold grounds. Deeply weird that he was more of a morning person as a vampire. Maybe he was just enjoying having a morning again, instead of becoming a floaty ghost at dawn.  
  
¬† ""Eve's up. You'd better make it so dark the spoon melts. ""  
  
¬† Michael shot her a half-smile, still almost lethal enough to stop a girl's heart. Luckily he knew just how much current to use on his charm. ""That bad, huh?""  
  
¬† She thought about it for a second as she took down a bowl, the box of Rice Krispies, and found the milk behind the bottles of beer --contraband, from Shane -- in the fridge. ""You've seen that movie where the zombies eat people's brains?""  
  
¬† ""Night of the Living Dead?""  
  
¬† ""The zombies would run if they got a look at her. ""  
  
¬† Michael spooned extra coffee into the fresh filter. He looked good, she thought. Strong, tall, confident. He had on a nice blue shirt and some not-so-ratty blue jeans, and he was wearing shoes. Running shoes, sure, but shoes. Claire stared at his feet. ""You're going out,"" she said.  
  
¬† ""Got a job,"" Michael said serenely. ""Working at JT's Music over on Third Street, ten to close. Mostly I'll be demoing guitars and selling them, but JT said he'd let me do some private lessons if I wanted. ""  
  
¬† That was so . . . normal. Really normal. Claire bit her lip and tried to organize the explosion of questions in her brain. ""Ah -- what about the sun?"" she asked. Because that seemed to be the first hurdle.  
  
¬† ""They issued me a car,"" Michael said. ""It's in the garage. Fully sunproofed. And there's underground parking at JT's. There is most places. ""  
  
¬† ""Issued -- who issued you a car?"" He shot her a you're not stupid look. ""The town? Amelie?""  
  
¬† He didn't answer directly as he slid the filter compartment shut and turned on the brew switch. The machine began wheezing and peeing into the pot. ""They tell  
me it's standard procedure,"" he said. ""For new vampires. ""  
  
¬† ""Not there have been any for fifty years, right?""  
  
¬† He shrugged. It was obvious that she was making him uncomfortable with the questions, but Claire couldn't help herself. ""Michael --did they get you the job, too?""  
  
¬† ""No. I know JT. I got the job all by myself. They offered -- "" He stopped, clearly thinking he'd already said too much.  
  
¬† Claire finished it out, guessing. ""They offered you some kind of job in the vampire community. Right? Or -- "" Oh, God. ""Or they offered to make you a Protector?""  
  
¬† ""Not right off the bat,"" he said, still staring at the coffee maker. ""You have to work up to that. So they say. ""  
  
¬† Michael. Owning people. Skimming off of their wages like some Mafia don. She tried not to let him see how sick that idea made her feel, that he'd ever really consider doing it.  
  
¬† His eyes suddenly cut toward her, as if he'd read her mind. ""I didn't do it. I took the job at JT's, Claire,"" Michael said, and suddenly moved toward her. She flinched, and he took a deep breath and held out his hand in clear apology. ""Sorry. I forget sometimes -- it's hard, okay, learning how to move around people when I can go so much faster. But I wouldn't hurt you, Claire. No way. ""  
  
¬† ""Shane thinks -- ""  
  
¬† Light caught and flared in Michael's eyes, eerie and frightening, and then he blinked and it was gone. He obviously made a real effort to keep his voice quiet. ""Shane's wrong,"" he said. ""I'm not changing, Claire. I'm still your friend. I'll look after you. All of you. Even Shane. ""  
  
¬† She didn't answer him. Truthfully, as much as she liked him -- and it verged on love -- she felt something different about him today. Something complicated and agitated and strange.  
  
¬† Was he . . . hungry? He was staring at her. No, he was staring at the thin skin of her neck, wasn't he? Claire put her hand to it, involuntary but irresistible, and Michael got a very slight pink flush in his pale cheeks and looked away.  
  
¬† ""I wouldn't,"" he said, in a far different tone than before. It almost sounded scared to her. ""I wouldn't, Claire. You have to believe me. But -- this is hard. It's so hard. ""  
  
¬† She did believe him, mostly because she could hear all the heartbreak and sorrow in his voice. She took a breath, stepped forward, and hugged him. He was tall, the top of her head only brushed his chin. His arms felt strong and comforting, and she told herself that he wasn't warm because it was chilly in the kitchen. It wasn't really true, but that helped.  
  
¬† ""I wouldn't hurt you,"" he murmured. ""But I've got to admit, I want to. I spent all my life hating vampires, and now -- now look at me. ""  
  
¬† ""You had to,"" Claire said. ""You didn't have a choice. ""  
  
¬† She felt his sigh go through both of them. ""Yeah,"" he said, ""Shane's right, I did have a choice. But this is the choice I made, and now I have to live with it. ""  
  
¬† He let go when she stepped back. Neither of them knew what to say, so Claire busied herself by opening kitchen cabinets to get down the four mismatched cups they used in the morning. Michael's was plain chunky stoneware, oversized, like a diner cup on steroids. Eve's was a petite black thing with a yawning cartoon vampire on it. Shane's had a happy face with a bloody bullet hole in the center of its forehead. Claire had taken one with Goofy and Mickey on it.  
  
¬† ""How's school?"" Michael asked. Neutral subjects. He didn't want to talk it out, he wanted to keep it inside. She wasn't too surprised. Michael had always been too self-contained for his own good, as far as she could tell.  
  
¬† ""Too easy,"" she sighed, and poured coffee.  
  
¬† They were sitting down and sipping from their mugs when the kitchen door opened, and Shane -- wearing pajama bottoms and a ratty old faded t-shirt -- came into the kitchen. He avoided Michael, picked up his cup off the counter, and filled it to the brim. He left without a word.  
  
¬† Michael watched him go, face set and hard.  
  
¬† Claire felt the need to apologize. ""He's just -- ""  
  
¬† ""I know,"" Michael said. ""Believe me. I know exactly how Shane is. Doesn't mean I have to like it right now. ""  
  
¬† I really need to stop being the Glass Goodwill Ambassador, Claire thought, but she knew she'd keep on doing it. Somebody had to, after all. So after she'd finished her coffee, she went to talk to Shane.  
  
¬† Shane's door was unlocked and slightly open. Claire pushed it and stepped inside, then stopped short. All her carefully prepared speeches flew right out of her head, because Shane was getting dressed.  
  
¬† The sight of him short-circuited her thought processes and completely grounded her better judgment. He'd already hauled on his blue jeans, and his back was to her. No shirt yet. She was spellbound by the ripples of muscles on his back, the gorgeous smoothness of his skin, the way his shaggy hair brushed the tops of his shoulders and begged to be smoothed back . . .  
  
¬† The sound of his zipper being pulled up snapped her back to sanity. She stepped hastily back, out into the hall, and pulled the door almost shut, then knocked.  
  
¬† ""What?"" It wasn't a friendly response.  
  
¬† ""It's me,"" she said. ""Can I come in?""  
  
¬† She heard something halfway between a grunt and a sigh, and opened the door to find him dragging a dark gray, form-fitting shirt over his head. It looked very good on him. Not as good as the no-shirt thing, but she was trying hard not to think about that. It had made her warm and fluttery inside.  
  
¬† ""Is that a new shirt?"" she asked, desperate to get her mind off the vivid mental pictures that kept bubbling up. That got another indefinite grunt. ""It looks nice. ""  
  
¬† Shane gave her an ironic look. ""We're talking clothes now? Wait, let me get my Fashion for Dummies book. ""  
  
¬† ""I -- never mind. About Michael -- ""  
  
¬† ""Stop. "" Shane stepped forward and kissed her on the forehead. ""I know, you don't want me ripping him, but I can't help it. Give me some time, okay? I need to figure some things out. ""  
  
¬† Claire tipped her head back, and this time he found her lips. It was, she thought, supposed to be a fast and sweet little kiss, but somehow it slowed down, got warmer and deeper. His lips were damp and soft as silk, and that was such a contrast to the hard lines of his body pressed against her. The strength of his hands sliding around her waist and pulling her even closer. She heard him growl low in his throat, a wild and hungry sound that made her go weak and faint.

This is my last first post here and I feel comfort being able to talk about my problems. I am a 35yo male. I just had my 4th afib episode ever on Thursday morning. I was in afib for about 6 hours and converted with flecainide at the hospital. My first episode was in 2019 and I have two more each about a year apart. During those episodes I had been drinking or smoking or doing something that triggered the episodes. I‚Äôve been sober for a year now and have been at the gym a lot recently. I‚Äôll admit my sleep is not what it should be lately and I have one cup of coffee a day. I‚Äôm not sure exactly why my afib got trigged again but this time they put me on eliquis and they want me to take it for 4 weeks. I have no family history of heart disease and all my bloodwork was good. 

Now that I‚Äôm home I feel like I‚Äôm having some symptoms maybe this is how it feels to recover I don‚Äôt know because it‚Äôs been so long. My chest just feels kinda weird and I have a slight anxiety, little aches and pains. I‚Äôm wondering has anyone else experienced this? How do you guys deal with having episodes like this?

1m6zxvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dallasurbanists/comments/1m6zxvg/8_tips_for_navigating_dallas_without_a_car_during/,8 Tips for Navigating Dallas Without a Car During Week Without Driving 2025,"Are you considering participating in the annual [Week Without Driving](https://weekwithoutdriving.org) challenge, taking place from September 29 to October 5 this year? Or are you simply curious about what your neighborhood or city might look like from a new perspective?

Navigating a city without a car is a learned skill‚Äîespecially for many Texans accustomed to driving as their only mode of transportation. Just as earning a driver‚Äôs license requires months of instruction and practice, learning to move through the city by walking, cycling, and taking public transit requires conscious effort and adaptation.

Here are eight practical tips for anyone learning to navigate Dallas without a car for the first time:

# 1. SHOP LOCAL.

When I owned a car and drove everywhere, a simple search for ‚Äúcool coffee shops in DFW‚Äù often drove me 20 or 30 miles into distant suburbs, chasing social media recommendations. Now, after nearly four years without a car, I intentionally support businesses located in my neighborhood‚Äîor those that are easily accessible by public transit. Shopping locally not only builds community but also reduces unnecessary travel.

# 2. BUNDLE NEARBY TRIPS.

When I had a car, I rarely planned my errands intentionally; I ran them whenever the mood struck. This often meant spending hours in traffic, zigzagging across the city. Without a car, I‚Äôve learned to trip-chain‚Äîbundling errands in the same neighborhood on the same day, and spreading out more distant errands over multiple days. This strategy reduces travel time and makes daily life more manageable.

# 3. COMBINE MODES.

When searching for transit directions on Google Maps, remember that estimated trip times usually assume you‚Äôll walk between transit stops. But you can also bring a bicycle or scooter on any DART bus or train‚Äîand even on GoLink vans. Combining modes, like biking to a bus stop or taking a scooter on a train, can reduce trip times and unlock flexible, creative options that aren‚Äôt possible with a single mode of travel.

# 4. INVOLVE YOUR COMMUNITY.

Say you finish work at 5:00 PM and have an event at 6:30 PM. Public transit might get you there on time‚Äîbut what if you need to feed your dog (or bird, or cat) first? Going car-free requires more than just logistical skills; it also calls for resourceful relationships. Instead of paying thousands on a car, you might pay your neighbor a visit to ask for help when you‚Äôre in a pinch.

# 5. MANAGE EXPECTATIONS.

This is a tip I still struggle with, but it applies whether you drive, bike, or take transit: communicate if there's a risk of being late. Let others know if you might miss a bus or train. As a society, we‚Äôve learned to accommodate people delayed by car traffic; we should extend the same understanding to those navigating public transit, which is also subject to delays‚Äîsometimes caused by traffic itself.

# 6. CHOOSE WELL-CONNECTED LOCATIONS.

Imagine you and a friend are choosing between two restaurants. One is served by a single bus route every 20 to 30 minutes. The other is served by two bus routes, each running every 15 to 20 minutes. Choosing destinations with multiple transit options increases your chances of arriving on time and reduces the stress of waiting.

# 7. HAVE A BACKUP ROUTE.

This tip builds on the previous ones: when planning a trip, don‚Äôt rely solely on the first suggested route. Review the second and third options, too. Bringing a bike can greatly expand your backup plans. When estimating travel time, consider aiming for an earlier departure‚Äîif you miss your first bus, you‚Äôll still have time to catch the next one and stay on schedule.

# 8. REFLECT ON YOUR ITINERARY.

I‚Äôll admit‚Äîpunctuality has never been my strength. But I was even worse when I drove. Owning a car encouraged me to overcommit, believing I could be everywhere. Going car-free didn‚Äôt magically make me punctual, but it did force me to ask harder questions: Did I need to attend every event? Was it worth traveling so far? If something is happening two hours away, was it really meant for me to begin with?

If you're like I was when I first gave up driving, the *Week Without Driving* challenge may reveal a hidden cost of car dependence: lifestyle creep‚Äîthe gradual expansion of commitments, distance, and expectations that only a car can sustain.",4,1753245175.0,dallasurbanists,2,0.84,False
1m6zx9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIBeingTooSensitive/comments/1m6zx9w/male_friend_being_creepy/,Male friend being creepy?,"I (19F) have a friend (33M, we‚Äôll call him Fred) who recently has been weird. The age gap already might be suspect, but for context we‚Äôve been friends for a bit under a year and met at a con. So we share a hobby and it‚Äôs a really big part of both of our lives. 

More important context: I‚Äôm a lesbian and have been in a relationship with my GF (22F) for 2 years. The entire time I‚Äôve known Fred I‚Äôve been in this relationship and he‚Äôs also friends with GF. We all met at the same time at the same con.

Our friendship has been nothing but platonic for the entirety of the time we‚Äôve known each other. Occasionally we joke about nsfw topics, but it‚Äôs always very impersonal and is immature (think stupid dick jokes). We hang out pretty often, and since he makes way more money than me he usually treats me to food/coffee. I draw for him to make up for it.

A couple days ago I went to stay with him for a night because GF and I have been having a lot of issues that Fred knows about. His opinion of GF is unfavorable now and he often implied we should break up, despite me reiterating multiple times that we aren‚Äôt going to do that and that this is just a rough patch that is being worked through. 

While I was there, we talked in his room for a while before both going to bed. As he was leaving, he hugged me and said ‚ÄúLet me know if you want to cuddle, Lord knows I could use it too.‚Äù I thought that was a little weird but not necessarily creepy. Didn‚Äôt take him up on it obviously. 

While he was taking me home, he asked to see my hands. I did one of these üôå but showing the backs of my hands. He said ‚ÄúOh, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to claw my back like I want you to‚Äù which immediately grossed me out hard. He then told me that he had a dream about this. I found it weird that he told me this at all because previously things like this he‚Äôs said are ‚Äúinside Fred thoughts‚Äù. An example of one of these iFt‚Äôs was when I asked if I was going to be the only girl at his DND group he invited me to. He said I wouldn‚Äôt even have had the biggest tits. That was more funny and less creepy because it‚Äôs pretty obvious I have a large chest and I joke about it from time to time.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the interaction though, and it makes me feel so gross every time it pops up in my head. Like a pretty visceral reaction. I‚Äôm worried he might‚Äôve been joking and just‚Ä¶bad at it? Or it didn‚Äôt come out right or something? Am I being sensitive?

Green Flags/Pros
- The basics: He‚Äôs super smart, has a great (super tough) job, attractive, polite, and has a house. (I also have a good job and a house). We actually live less than 5 minutes away from each other.
- First date went well! We spent four hours together and had a few moments of silence. I led the conversation, but I think he‚Äôs just a quiet guy. He said that he isn‚Äôt a great conversationalist, but I could tell that he was trying his best.
- Even though I asked him on the date, he insisted on paying. He didn‚Äôt even like what we were doing (he doesn‚Äôt drink coffee) and he suggested we go to my favorite pizza place for our second date (I mentioned the place super briefly during the first date and he doesn‚Äôt really like pizza!). I find little gestures like that to be super thoughtful.
- He walked to me to my car even though his was parked far away in the opposite direction, it was in broad daylight, and it was 105 degrees out. I had a date once not walk me to my car when I was parked far away and it was pitch black out, so this gesture was a big green flag for me. 
- A nerdy stereotype (sorry), but he doesn‚Äôt play any video games! The last 2 engineers I‚Äôve dated spend hours each day playing video games. 
- Not weird, but he‚Äôs never had social media of any kind. He said that he just never got into it.


Yellow Flags
- We don‚Äôt have a ton in common.
- I asked him on the first date, I initiated exchanging numbers, and I also initiated the second date when I sent him the post-date thank you text. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs lack of initiative or that he just doesn‚Äôt really know what to do or say.
- All tied together: His experience with women (dating, anything physical, etc.)/social life/hobbies are basically non-existent. I was his first app date, despite him having a profile since January, and he admits he has no friends, which isn't surprising given his background. His intense focus on engineering degrees, poor texting habits, being really shy, lack of any social media, 55+ hour work weeks, and not really putting himself out there/staying at home could explain why. Throughout college, he commuted and juggled two jobs while studying engineering. He moved out of state at the start of COVID and seems to have kept to himself ever since, describing his routine as simply going to work, coming home, and watching TV. It's hard to tell if this is due to exhaustion from a stressful job or a that he just doesn‚Äôt have anyone to do things with.
- It sounds like he is super close with his family, like spends a whole day or more each weekend with them. I don‚Äôt know if he spends time with just his parents or if his siblings join as well. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just because they‚Äôre super close or that spending time with them is his social outlet. He‚Äôs the second oldest out of 4 boys, and his brothers are all super athletic and outgoing (think hockey frat bro). His dad sounds like a big tough guy, so I wonder if he was kind of the lonely nerdy kid that wasn‚Äôt included. 
- Lack of communication. He said that he prefers to text only to ask quick questions. He would rather talk on the phone. After we arranged our dates, we haven‚Äôt texted/messaged since. This is super unusual for me - but maybe it‚Äôs not a bad thing? Again, he‚Äôs an engineer, so it might follow the very logical/rational way of thinking. Also, if he doesn‚Äôt have any friends or girls to text, he might never have gotten into texting?

We chatted for about 10 minutes the night I contracted her, and then she woke me up before 7 o‚Äôclock the next morning to answer one of the questions I had asked her the previous evening.  I asked her if she had plans the following day and she said no.  So I asked her if she would like to meet for coffee. She responded that she had plans with her boyfriend and friends.  I tried to steer the conversation back to a friendly way, but she didn‚Äôt respond.  Later in the day, I apologized for making her uncomfortable.  I saw she read the message.  She didn‚Äôt respond.

You say you don't trust anyone, maybe its because you tell so many fibs. You're so indecisive, which is fine, it works for you. Overall, I work hard ti not be like that. Im pretty solid when I tell someone I'll be there, I show up. If im gonna be late or I can't make I call them and let them know. It hurt me that you basically rolled off of me and left, no call the next day. No text or anything until I reached out to you. Then to talk about me behind my back, I should've known as you've never spoken kindly about anyone. I see you writing all kinds of letters, im sure one will work out the way you want. I gotta say thank you for your patience in teaching me the lessons I still needed to learn. I no longer rely on anyone for anything. I no longer want a business partner, I can do it on my own I'm not afraid! I am capable! I no longer rely on someone to be in my bed only to have them promising the world as they walk out the door. After the door closes and um alone to sit in thought, when I should have been curled up in your arms. We should have woken together drank a coffee in our pj's before work. If it was a day off, we should've gone for a hike, fishing, a drive.... something! But ""no"" you didnt want to. 

I felt like you never wanted to be seen with me. Looking back on it, you could've had a wife and family. You never introduced me to your family. I stopped sending them planters, because I thought wtf am I doing spending $60 on people i dont even know and who obviously dont care to kknow me. I'm sure you told them something horrible about me. I'm sure all your friends think I'm horrible too. Oh well, I realize a person who doesn't ike someone who they don't even know based on another person's opinion is someone who's thoughts are not worth caring about. 

I found you to be captivating, charming, funny and unique. You attention to detail in all that you see is as sharp as your wit. I fell in love with your gentle, kind, loving soul. You have more love and passion than ive ever known anyone else to have. The fact that you allowed me to see that gentle loving side of you is something I will cherish forever. Thank you for that, I share it with no one. It was the most beautiful experience of my life. Now the tears are flowing down my face, yet the memory also has a big smile on my face. Im not sad anymore, I've learned over the years if your person is the least bit unsure and not wanting to take that leap, then its not gonna get better. If you think im giving up on you, thats not the case at all. If I ever thought I had a chance.... Wrong time, too old, not pretty enough, saggy skin, it doesn't matter. The fact that it does matter to you is a definite confirmation that I should not be chasing this one. Eventhough, I never chase. I was forthright and bold, you were the only one tiptoeing and being skittish. Call it chasing if you need too. I think I'm changing, because I certainly have no desire to spend another minute of my life strok'n Ego. No f---ing way, those days are a thing of the past and have been released. I am caring and nurturing to those who appreciate it. 

I'm also tired of being underestimated. I know ive contributed to that because I was taught to not outshine a sibling. I was always told to tone it down, dont smile so much, dont talk to much, dont sing, dont you dare win at games, nobody likes people who  talk about smart stuff, when they call you ""a know it all"". They are making fun of you, nobody likes a know it all.  So Ive always dummied up, I see and know way more than everyone even cares to know. I keep to myself. I dont hate, I dont even know what that feels like. I always forgive, I stay mad for 7 min, then im good. I go quiet when I get mad and if I dont talk for a bit, its not a punishment. I just struggle to articulate what will match my feelings. I like to have a final goal, my opinion, my ideas for solution, what my job for resolution. So that its not just diarrhea of attacks that spew from my mouth. Its rare that I'll ever raise my voice on anger. I find nothing gets solved in those kinds of spewing fights. Its a redundant waste of both of our time. I understand human behavior way better than most people. Thats why I can always forgive, because I get it. I try not to judge people based on societal norms. However, I hear people say they dont judge, I think we all judge people. Yknow when you meet someone and after a conversation with them, you may think or say to a friend, 'what a creepy guy"" or ""i like her, she's hularious"". I guess its more of judginging based on whether that person could be in your life or not 

Stop wondering why you dont have honest, trustworthy people, who aren't on the take, in your life. Its clearly because you push good people that love and care about you away. Im sure you know that, though. Im sure you even know how to stop doing it. I think you like the drama and chaos. I however do not. I've already had a lifetime of that BS, now I want peace. I want to work hard and travel. I want to lay on a beach for a month every winter. I want to bungee jump, I want to go on a pilgrimage, I want to go on a remote retreat and study meditation and yoga, I want to build a house for a family in Mexico. I want to see wild animals roaming on the Serengti.

I want a partner, a best friend. No tricks, no games and no mind fuckery. I want to be loved just because I'm me. I have had a few nights where I had time alone, all those nights you stood me up, and I realized I am loveable. I love me! Im fun, Im hilarious and always make myself laugh, im nice and forgiving. When I make a mistake and it hurts me or anyone else I apologize, I stand up for me. I dont let other woman put me in the back or dim my light anymore. Those who cant handle me as I am should step aside.

I dont care what kind of super powers you possess. I dont have any, I cant read your mind and um certain I dont want to. So stop thinking that I can. I also do not read reddit thinking I know anyone. Yes, I used to and it effed with my mind so I turned it off. I still have dreams that tell me enough and I can tell when lies are told in a conversation one on one. Thats it. So when you thought you told me and I ignored you. It didnt happen. Your actions gave me nothing positive. 

**This is my reminder of who stays who doesn't just incase you care enough to stay, I'd welcome you with open arms and pour my love all over you and you (that special you know who) could put your love all over me, too!! (wink, wink) **

I refuse to wait and wonder while feeling sick to my stomach for a man all night

I refuse to be treated with disrespect; just because you are  having a bad day

I refuse to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't take responsibility for their actions

I refuse to be with someone who doesn't make amends when needed

I no longer stay quiet when I have something to say

I no longer accept ANYBODY to treat me less than. I am WORTHY

I no longer accept the silent treatment if I have upset you, have enough respect to tell me.

My family is important to me, if you dont have anything nice to say about them, SAY NOTHING at all

Never, try to come between us. If you come up against them, I will turn momma-bear!

Don't put yourself in a position to be second guessed and you won't be. It's easy

Of you want to build trust, be consistently trustworthy

Being mysterious isn't sexy it actually creates distrust

Trying to make your person jealous in the beginning; they will see you as  a player and be turned offƒ∫",1,1753244639.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

## The Good

- **Organic Revenue Growth**: Delivered 5% organic revenue growth in Q2, in line with their long-term growth algorithm.
- **Margin Expansion & Profitability**: Robust margin expansion (gross margin up 80bps, operating margin up 190bps), and 4% comparable EPS growth despite currency/tax headwinds.
- **Resilient Industry & Value Share Gains**: Seventeenth consecutive quarter of value share gains; industry remains resilient.
- **Strong Performance in Key Markets**: Sequential volume improvement in the US and Europe; strong local execution cited in Africa and China.
- **Marketing & Innovation Success**: Launched successful campaigns like Share a Coke in 120+ countries and innovative products such as Sprite Plus Tea and US cane sugar Coca-Cola.
- **Fairlife Growth**: Fairlife posted double-digit volume growth and is managing capacity constraints with new facilities coming online in 2026.
- **Productivity Initiatives**: Marketing transformation and disciplined cost management drove better-than-expected productivity, allowing reinvestment in growth.
- **Strong Balance Sheet & Free Cash Flow**: Free cash flow (ex-Fairlife payment) was $3.9B, up ~$600M YoY; net debt leverage at 2x EBITDA (low end of target).
- **Updated (Still Solid) Guidance**: Maintained organic revenue growth guidance (5-6%), raised comparable currency-neutral EPS growth target to ~8%.
- **Targeted Recovery Actions**: Demonstrated agility with ‚Äúall-weather strategy,‚Äù quickly pivoting in response to local market disruptions (e.g., weather, geopolitical).
- **Resolution of US Hispanic Consumer Issue**: Targeted advertising and messaging helped recover lost share and restore brand equity among this key demographic.

---

## The Bad

- **Volume Decline**: Overall volume declined 1% in Q2, with notable declines in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and India.
- **Currency & Tax Headwinds**: Significant currency headwinds (5% impact on EPS) and a higher effective tax rate (up ~2pts YoY).
- **Capacity Constraints in Fairlife**: Supply constraints are limiting growth, with incremental volume only possible when new US capacity comes online in 2026.
- **Consumer Pressure in Some Segments**: Noted pressure among lower-income consumers, especially in North America and some emerging markets, requiring more value/affordability initiatives.
- **Mixed Performance in Asia Pacific**: Volume declined in key ASEAN markets (Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam); Japan and South Korea also had volume declines.
- **Geopolitical & Weather Disruptions**: India and Mexico were hit by early monsoons, hurricanes, and regional conflicts, impacting Q2 results and creating uncertainty for recovery timing.
- **Costa Coffee Underperformance**: Costa has not met its investment hypothesis, with growth skewed towards stores and underperformance in ready-to-drink and at-home segments.

---

## The Ugly

- **No Strong Volume Recovery Yet**: Despite optimism, volume growth is not yet back to positive territory, and recovery in some markets (like India and Mexico) remains uncertain and dependent on external factors.
- **Persistent External Uncertainty**: The ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù and ‚Äúchoppy‚Äù external environment (economic, weather, geopolitical) is causing rapid shifts in market conditions, making forecasting and strategic planning tougher.
- **Currency Hedging Lag**: While recent currency moves are positive, Coca-Cola‚Äôs hedging strategy means benefits will take time to materialize‚Äîso FX headwinds persist in the near term.
- **Sustained Headwinds in Key Emerging Markets**: ASEAN region‚Äôs ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù weakness, Latin America‚Äôs continued volume decline, and the slow resolution of India‚Äôs issues show pockets of real struggle.
- **Tough Comps Ahead**: Q4 will face tough comparisons in concentrate volume, and the company admits the fourth quarter will have an extra day but still expects challenges.

Whatever, i brewed my cup of this Vienna and it tasted of nothing. No flavor, trash coffee. I spent close to 600 rs on this and each time I order TWC, I've had a terrible experience.

Now that BT also roasts and ships from Bengaluru, I wanted to know if there are any decent roasters in Mumbai who sell a bag for 500-600 for 250gm who roast in small batches hence ensuring freshness. ",2,1753244545.0,IndiaCoffee,4,1.0,False

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two ERAs**  
The Cincinnati Reds (52-49) enter this matchup as a slight favorite, with moneyline odds hovering around **-150 to -170** (implied probability: \~62.5%‚Äì64%). Their starter, **Chase Burns** (0-1, 6.19 ERA), is the definition of a ""work in progress""‚Äîhe‚Äôs struck out 25 batters in 16 ‚Öì innings but has also allowed 6.19 runs per game, which is roughly how many times a fan checks their phone during a Nationals‚Äô at-bat.

The Washington Nationals (40-60), meanwhile, are priced at **+215 to +220** (implied probability: \~31.3%‚Äì32.5%), a number that feels generous given their **5.27 staff ERA** and **1.415 WHIP** (walks + hits per inning). Their starter, **Brad Lord** (2-5, 3.46 ERA), is a two-inning miracle worker who‚Äôs held opponents scoreless in his last two outings‚Äî*if ‚Äúopponents‚Äù includes a team of toddler baseballers*.

The total runs line sits at **8.5**, with the Over/Under odds hovering around **EVENS**. Given the Nationals‚Äô porous defense and Burns‚Äô volatility, this feels like a number set by a bookie who‚Äôs never seen a Nationals‚Äô infield.

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, or ""Why This Team Should Fold Now""**  
The Nationals are a team begging for a plot twist. Their **5.27 ERA** is worse than a college student‚Äôs chances of acing a math class after binge-watching Netflix. Recent ""news"" includes:

* **James Wood**, their 24-HR slugger, being spotted *napping in the on-deck circle* during a game. Not metaphorically. With a blanket.
* A **team-wide caffeine shortage**, allegedly caused by a barista union strike. Second baseman **Cory Spangenberg** was overheard saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd pay $15 for a coffee, but my wallet says ‚ÄòNo, you‚Äôd pay $15 and still feel awful.‚Äô‚Äù
