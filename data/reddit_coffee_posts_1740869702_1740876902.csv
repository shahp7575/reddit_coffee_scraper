1j1en3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j1en3c/just_dropped_my_exs_things_off/,Just dropped my ex's things off,"I broke up with my girlfriend almost 6 weeks ago, and I really miss her. I regret doing it in the first place. I tried to reach out on DM's, call, text, etc, but every time I did, she blocked me without saying a word. I remember the mistakes I made within our relationship and have beaten myself up over them. Today, I decided to try to avoid having any of her things around my house. I figured that might make it easier to accept that it was over, so I boxed up all the things that held amazing memories (clothes, Xbox controller, bathing suits, books, tennis rackets, and coffee cups) and took them to her house. I didn't tell her or anyone I was going. I just kind of drove there thinking that it was going to be the last time I'd take that same route. I got there, and within 30 seconds, I left the box on her porch. I didn't know if she was home, but I was hoping she wouldn't come out. My legs shook so hard when I was back inside the car, and I began to drive off. Quite honestly, a part of me wishes she could've come outside and hugged me and wanted to try again. I took one last look in her window as I drove off, and that was it. The entire experience was so quiet,t and the place I once went all the time felt like nothing. I want to respect her wish to move on, but never receiving closure saying she doesn't want to ever talk to me again eats away at me. Like ""maybe she might come back"", ""this could end someday"". It's just hard to  realize that her blocking me and not saying anything was that bit of ""closure"", I guess. I miss her. ",1,1740876780.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1j1elog,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1j1elog/so_straight_up_question_at_what_point_does_the/,So straight up question: at what point does the lds system of belief actually start to match what they preach in terms of helping the world?,"Genuinely asking with no hostility how in good faith do you be a Mormon? Like I feel like you have to jump through so many loopholes to be like “yeah this is the right way to be, this is how you reach enlightenment”. Like you have to justify a uber racist past and then present of shame because the anti gay marriage standpoint is just cartoonishly evil from my perspective . Matching whatever stance the government has on drug use at the time because your scripture doesn’t specifically prohibit anything other than tea and coffee. I feel like that discourages the use of plant medicines by demonizing them and generally holds people back to from reaching a more stable mental health situation with becoming dependent on ssris. So with all mind plus the other the regular talking points at what point does it actually become appealing to join, and are any of those reason to join based in objective reality or non exclusive to Mormons? I don’t feel like the promise of happiness is a valid reason because only like 4 million people believe it’s a thing and it’s not based in objective reality. A point could be made that there’s clearly something too it because a lot of Mormons are good people but there are lesbian porn farmers that are equally as good people.

1j1elmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1j1elmu/i_cant_tell_if_im_being_a_bother/,I can't tell if I'm being a bother.,"Hello, I have a friend who I would like to get to know more, but every time I ask him out to a coffee, he will take a week or so to respond. I do know he has pretty bad social anxiety surrounding texting, but a whole week??? Sometimes we will see each other in passing and I still don't get a response until much later. I'm an introvert but putting myself out there, and have pretty bad rejection sensitivity...I'm trying to reframe this as not being a big deal, but I can't help but feel like a nuisance. Last time we went out for coffee he was all nervous giggles when we met up, and it seemed like he enjoyed himself. 

For context, when we are in the same space we are painfully shy around each other. We don't often start convos directly to each other, but will find reasons to share the same space and dart glances. All other signs point to his interest, but I can't help but wonder if this is all in my head. I've not so stealthily asked mutual friends about this situation, and he chuckled and said he thinks our friend is just being very shy. 

I find it hard to speak in person, but easier to text, I guess I'm just looking to hear about the other end of folks who don't like to text but prefer phone calls or talking in person. ",1,1740876659.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

1j1ekaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1j1ekaa/improvement_thread_come_contribute/,Improvement Thread - Come & Contribute 🤗,"Rant: 
Since my very detailed post got deleted on accident while switching to another app, I have to yet again write everything out so bear with me lol 

Context:
We all ask/share quite specific inquieries and give quite specific answers to such questions on this subreddit, however I wanted us all to come together to form a thread with all of the tips/tricks/experiences/knowledge that someone could use as of right now in social interactions no matter the circumstance. I believe something like this already exists, but I thought it would be good to do a more recent thread and I would be real happy if we could collaborate in as big of a number as possible so to create a lot of variety and practical knowledge in one place.

The challange:
The forementioned tips/tricks... should revolve around your own experience and the things that you changed that lead to better outcomes in your social life.
- be it with people you were okay with but now you suddenly became good friends, 
- be it with people who disrespected you but you managed to flip the script and now you have their uppermost respect, 
- be it with people who were resentful towards you but you managed to shift their attitude... 
So all cases are valuable. And what I want you to do is share the tips as straighforwards as possible with an example of how someone else could do it too. If necessary and if you are comfortable doing so, you may give context to your contribution. Please avoid mean comments and contributions as simple as ""read this book..."" and thats it. Your experience and wisdom is what matters, not the content of some book.

Tips/Tricks - Your Task:
They should be one of the following: body language, body cues, tone and pitch of voice,  assertiveness, observations, asking good questions, improvising conversations , developing small talk, improving active listening skills ,development of humour, patterns in someones behaviour (and how to spot them), specific language usage (non-generic compliments, certain phrases ""ex. how was your day"" -> to now using ""what was the most exciting thing that happened to you today""...)...etc. [anything along these lines]
- I hope I was able to give you enough examples so that the goal is more understandable after reading them.

My Contribution:
I'll make the first contribution to start things off: 

Observation: I have observed that despite the common claim that authentic people will attract more people towards them, at times that can be quite the contrary, as I have seen people who use manipulation in the form of presenting themselves through different masks to be better at creating larger circles around them. Which is human nature as Robert Green discussed in his book.

Tip: However, as someone who seeks to be authentic, what will make you stand out is being polite, having manners, respecting others and most importantly smiling. I cant stress this enough, even if someone makes you think the opposite, just know that its okay not to be good with everyone and as someone who doesnt like bs, you have a higher calling so pick up the damn phone and dont listen to the surrounding noise. Someone will come and they will appreciate you for being someone who has standards and for holding them despite others not doing so. For context, I went out today to grab a coffee to-go at a restaurant I go to frequently and as I walked in I saw the same waiter I had made an order to 3 days ago. Not once did I have an interaction with him apart from making my order as a custome. I came in and I didnt expect much, but I said you wouldn't believe what I am going to ask for, and he recalled my complete order from 3 days ago, and I was shell-shock, like this is not a restaurant that gets 10-20 people per day, but rather 200-300 with dozens of different orders. I started a conversation with him and I told him how I didnt expect him to remember me, where he replied: I discussed with my colleague the other day on how polite you were and there was just something positiv about you that you could not be forgotten. I appreciated that comment since not many people point that out to me, even though that's something I do automatically. We shook hands and left it on a good note. 


Now your turn 🥳: Whats something that helped you develop better relationships? What change did you make to any aspect of yourself, that resulted in better social outcomes?

I dont think this will get many replies, but maybe we can turn that around; who knows.

I have been to New Orleans many times now over the last 10 years. As a foodie, amateur chef (cajun and BBQ caterer) and enthusiast of cajun and creole cooking, I try to go to different places to eat whenever I am in Nola. By and large I try to hit casual spots that dont have dress codes and white table cloths. I am open to most recommendations as far as cajun, creole, soul food, American, Asian, etc. Not particularly interested in Mexican recommendations. I like Mexican but not what I look for in New Orleans. I love Italian but am hesitant to eat Italian when in Nola. Mostly because I want to do a bit of drinking when done eating and dont want to be zapped by a big plate of pasta. Also not interested in any buffets (once again, too much food). Im attaching a list of the places I have eaten. Some were drunken-I-need-food places, so please dont be critical. If there are some gems that you guys love that aren't on my list, Id like to know. As of now Im planning Jacues Imo's, Saint Germain, maybe Clesi's and Afrodisiac when I come down at the end of March. The list is not a ranking but an alphabetical list.

1j1eebs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1j1eebs/i_used_to_work_at_brooks_brothers_hardware_store/,I Used to Work at Brooks Brothers' Hardware Store {Part I},"

The Brooks Brother’s Hardware store stood alone on its main street block. Chipped layers of white-washed paint contrasted the darkness inside the tall narrow windows. Faded posters advertising Case knives and hand tools hung in the ground level windows, but the only thing in the second story windows, was a thick layer of cobwebs. Tonight, however the faint flicker of candle light betrayed the fact someone was upstairs.

The autumn breeze carried my breath away in white puffs as I lingered across the street, gripping my Maglite in shivering hands. I missed my coat, purposefully forgotten inside a few hours earlier. I took a deep breath of cold air and stepped into the street.

 

I started working for Mr. Brooks after getting passed over for an internship with the *Henderson Falls Gazette*. I was interested in investigative journalism and thought the internship would be a great segue into that career, and might even lead to a job covering the police beat after I graduated. At any rate, it would look great on a resume. Unfortunately, the editor’s son got the position, and I found myself turning in an application to Henderson Falls’ oldest business.

I think part of the reason Mr. Brooks hired me was so he could have a captive audience. As a senior member of the county’s historical society and a frequent contributor to the local paper, his mind was a repository for obscure and trivial facts about local history, especially as it pertained to his family. He never missed an opportunity to bring up Captain Brooks, one of the earliest members of his family to settle in Henderson County, Civil War hero, and founder of the Brooks Brothers’ Hardware Store.

Mr. Brooks kept a family history scrapbook with a section detailing the life, military service, and entrepreneurial pursuits of this earliest known relative. Clippings from the historical society’s newsletter mingled with pages copied from Civil War history books and hand-written notes from Mr. Brooks himself. They painted a clear, albeit concise picture of the man’s life.

According to the Old Man, Captain Brooks settled near Henderson Falls with his family at the age of 12, just in time for the 1850 census. The 1860 census, listed him as head of a household with 2 children. In 1861, records of troops mustered from Henderson County show he enlisted in the 34^(th) Ohio Infantry in either in April or May. Somehow, though probably through breveting, he obtained the rank of Captain by the end of the war. Shortly after, he returned to his family and started the Brooks Brothers Lumber company, later expanding into building materials and general hardware. By the time the 1880s arrived, Brooks Brothers’ Hardware Store was the largest building in town, boasting 2 storys, a scale for the grist mill, and even a spur off the B. & O. Railroad.

“And you know what else Tommy,” Mr. Brooks would say. “The Captain might’a gone to the house of representatives too if it weren’t for all that trouble with them damn Leylands.”

I nodded politely the first few times I heard about Captain Brooks. The stories were interesting, but you can only be so invested in the history of someone else’s relative. As Summer came to an end and I began my Junior year at Henderson Falls High, the Old Man moved on from talking about Captain Brooks, and started telling me about the history of Brooks Brothers’ Hardware itself. According to Mr. Brooks, post-Civil War Ohio saw a veritable boom in industry, construction, and manufacturing; and his family’s hardware store was there just in time to take advantage of it. He claimed Brooks Brothers sold many of the furnishings to the courthouse when it was refurbished in 1867, served as the county’s largest retail store, even stocked some of the first cans of paint from some up-and coming paint store out of Cleveland. You could tell from the gleam in his eye and the excitement in his words, he still looked at Brooks Brothers as a major business concern in Henderson Falls. I humored him. In spite of the once great store’s run-down appearance, shrinking nightly bank deposits, and dwindling customer base, Mr. Brooks’ enthusiasm was infectious.

That long summer stocking shelves, cleaning and making minor repairs familiarized me with all the quirks of the place. I knew the third bank of lights took longer to turn on because the ballasts were going bad. I could walk over the sagging hardwood floors without looking down. I even knew about the long crack creeping up the masonry, hidden behind a banner advertising a defunct brand of lead paint. The only part of the store I hadn’t ventured into was the second floor.

One slow, rainy day in June while looking for something to do, I decided to sort through the pile of merchandise covering the stairs behind the counter. The clutter on the bottom steps was all overstock: 16 penny nails, drywall screws, spools of fence wire, things it made sense to keep in the store instead of the warehouse. But the higher up the stairs I looked the older and more out of place the items seemed. Old tangles of hemp rope, wooden pulley blocks, asbestos floor tiles, even a box of old cut nails, rendered the path upstairs all but impassable. I climbed the first few steps, curious to see what else was in the heap of inventory when Mr. Brooks shouted at me.

“You! Get down from there, boy!” His voice shook with anger. I had no idea what caused my mild-mannered boss to go ballistic like that. In the few seconds it took for me to clamber around the junk back downstairs, Mr. Brooks’ expression softened back into that of a friendly old man.

“I didn’t mean to snap at you like that Tommy, but it ain’t safe up there.”

“I’m sorry Mr. Brooks. I just noticed all this inventory laying around and thought it’d look better if these things were cleared away.”

He raised a wrinkled hand, dismissing my concern. “I know you were just trying to help, but you need to stay down here. I haven’t been up there since the 50s.”

“Why not? The upstairs seems like a great place for storing inventory.”

The old man scratched his stubble. “If it was safe up there, you bet I’d keep some of our stock up there. I don’t trust that floor though. You’ve seen the ceiling over there next to the paint mixer?” He gestured to the front of the store, where a thin sheet of veneer plywood covered a swath of tiles on the high ceiling.

“I was up there one day, rough housing with my kid brother, Mike, you’ve never met him. Well anyway, we both ended up wraslin’ over a weak spot on the floor. The roof must’a had a leak and dry-rotted it. Long story short, my dad had to pull me and Mikey both out of the hole by our Buster Browns. Believe me, there’s no reason for you to go up there.”

 

My keys jangled as I turned the lock. I looked over my shoulder one last time, scanning the street for any witnesses before entering the inky darkness of the store. I tried to calm myself. I had done nothing wrong at this point. If anyone noticed me coming into the store at this hour, my cover story was plausible enough.

“I just stopped by to get my coat. I must have forgot it when I was locking up.”

 It somehow seemed less believable as I advanced over the warped wooden floorboards. Each footfall creaked. My pulse quickened as I walked along once familiar aisles. Claw hammers, spirit levels, auger bits, were all reduced by darkness to indiscernible, globby shadows. I wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but the old building made me nervous at night. As the days grew shorter, my pace walking to the front door after switching off the breakers for the store lights became faster and faster. I imagined the long aisles harboring some invisible presence, just behind me until I made it to the safety of the streetlights outside.

Finally, I reached the clerk’s desk in the back corner. My coat hung from the back of the tall chair, right where I left it. I slipped it on, glad for the warmth. The streetlamps outside provided just enough light for me to make out the shape of the stairs leading to the second story. As I gazed up the stairwell, trying to see the yellow glow I’d noticed from the street, I felt thin cold fingers gripped the back of my neck. I spun around ready to yell out of fear when I saw a single finger pressed against her lips.

“Are you *trying* to get us busted?” Jess hissed through clenched teeth.

“Maybe you shouldn’t sneak up on me like that.”

“What took you so long?” Jess rolled her head to one side as she leaned against the clerk’s desk. Her gum popped, punctuating her sentence.

“There wasn’t any parking outside the movie theater. I had to park down past the coffee shop and walk the rest of the way.”

“*Riiight*, then you had stare at the building for five minutes.” Jess scrunched up the bridge of her nose, teasing me.

 

Jess was Mr. Brooks’ granddaughter. I was busy stocking shelves one day in late July when she came into the store and wandered down the center aisle. Jess played varsity tennis and was one of Henderson Falls High’s cheerleaders. I had a huge crush on her at the time, but she was always surrounded by her group of jocks and preps, and I never had the guts to approach her. I heard Mr. Brooks climb off his stool in the back of the store and walk to meet her. They exchanged some words, too quiet for me to hear.

“Hey, Tommy. Come over here. I got someone for you to meet.”

I made my way to where they stood standing. Mr. Brooks wasted no time. “Tom, this is my granddaughter, Jess.”

We exchanged awkward smiles. In a school as small as Henderson Falls High, you know everyone, even if you don’t have classes together.

 Mr. Brooks went on. “She just got back from vacation down in Florida and we decided she ought’a take part in the family business. She’ll start next week. I need you to show her the ropes for me.”

 

 After work, I was more than a bit excited to tell my friend Kyle about my new coworker.

“Duuude! You’re working with Jessica Brooks? The cheerleader?”

“Yeah man, I’m pretty stoked.”

“That’s legit, son! If her friends come into the store, you gotta tell me.”

“Why?”

“Well… she’s friends with Robin Gardner. She could probably put in a good word for me, and if I just happen to stop by at the same time…”

“Kyle, why the hell would a bunch of cheerleaders want to hang out in a run-down hardware store?”

“Hey man, a guy can dream.”

It didn’t take long to realize working with Jess was not as Kyle put it “legit”. A typical shift with her started with Mr. Brooks leaving the store around 3:30, giving us a sly look over his shoulder and saying something like, “Now don’t you kids have too much fun.” Once he was out of sight, Jess would plop down in the desk chair behind the Case knife display. The week she started I tried showing her how to stock shelves, fill out hand receipts for customers, just basic stuff you’d expect from a hardware clerk. The most engagement I got from her was a nod or a few unconvincing words like “Wow, thanks for showing me” or “I’ll make sure to remember that.” Despite the simplicity of the job, she rarely helped restock shelves or clean up around the place. Instead, she spent most of her shift behind the desk, scrolling on her phone, doing homework, or passing customers off to me under the guise of ignorance. The closest thing to work she did was re-pricing items. Most of the store’s stock actually came from large box stores and was repriced for the local market. I discovered this when I noticed the remnants of a Home Depot sticker Jess either gave up on or forgot to remove entirely from a box of machine screws.

For the first few days she worked with me, I tried making conversation, but we didn’t seem to have a lot in common. If it didn’t have to do with school gossip, sports, or the music she listened to, she didn’t seem interested in talking about it. Strangely, when she lost interest in social media and had nothing else to do, I caught her flipping through the Brooks Family History Scrapbook and an old leatherbound book I’d never seen before. It seemed to start out of boredom, just another way to pass the time, but she seemed to become progressively more interested in her grandfather’s scrapbook and the leather book. She never struck me as a history person, but I wrote it off as more of an interest in her own family than anything. Despite the various diversions she had, Jess still found time to bother me.

Sometimes she would interrupt me from whatever book I was reading. By now, any excitement about working with her was gone. I would have rather worked alone instead of doing everything while she sat around. I stopped trying to make small talk with her and focused on doing my job.

“I don’t see how you can sit there, reading like that, Tom Boy”, she said smirking. I hated when she called me that.

“Why not?” I asked, not lifting my eyes from the pages.

“It just seems like such a boring way to spend your time.” She reclined in her chair, popping bubblegum between her teeth.

Another time, maybe while we were eating lunch behind the counter, she sighed loudly.

“It’s so unfair I have to work tomorrow. Stacey and Molly are going shopping without me.”

I knew she wanted me to cover her shift. Old Man Brooks had me scheduled from open to noon. I planned on meeting my friends on a camping trip, maybe do some hiking, kayaking, or just hang out by the lake. I said nothing.

She rolled her eyes. “What are you doing with *your* day off,” she asked.

“It’s not a day off,” I said. “I have to come in from open to noon. After that, I’ll probably meet up with Kyle and John at the lake.”

“That’s just the way you people are,” she smirked.

“What do you mean ‘you people’?”

“You know,” Jess blushed. “Country people living out of town. All you care about is being in the woods, hunting, and fishing, that stuff .”

I’d never been hunting in my life and thought fishing was boring. I decided to spare her the irony. She never showed up that afternoon and I had to close the store. I still went to the lake, but by then it was nearly dark and there wasn’t much to do but sit by the fire after a long day’s work.

The Saturday before fall break Mr. Brooks scheduled both of us to work on what turned out to be the busiest weekend we had in months. From the time we opened until late afternoon, a steady stream of customers came in for various items. When the chronically late Jess finally showed up, she wasn’t much help. Instead of helping customers herself, she referred them to me if there was something they couldn’t find or if they needed advice. I heard her say things like:

“I don’t know anything about plumbing Mr. Stevens, but Tom is basically a plumbing expert.”

“I totally forget how the paint mixer works Mrs. Anders, but Tom would be happy to mix those colors for you.”

“That truckload of mulch you ordered is right out back Mr. Lawson. Why don’t you pull around and Tom Boy can help you load everything before the rain picks up. I’m sure you can both get everything onto your trailer before the downpour really starts.”

I cringed. I hated it when she called me Tom Boy.

Sweat and rain soaked my clothes when I finally got back in the store. Jessica sat, scrolling through her phone with one hand, talking to yet another customer. Seeing me, her face lit up.

“Oh, here he comes! Tom, Mrs. Sandborn is looking for…”

“How about you do something for once and help her,” I snapped. “I’m going to lunch.”

The elderly woman’s mouth hung open, shocked by my rudeness. I grabbed my coat and walked out the front door. On the drive to the McDonalds, I cursed the bad weather and Jess’s laziness. In the short drive across town, my anger welled up inside me. I was pissed off I didn’t get the Gazette internship. I was pissed off Jess got paid to sit on her ass while I did all the work around the store. I was pissed off the line in the drive though was moving so slow.

When I finally got my food, I sped off from the drive through window, cursing under my breath, anticipating a screwed-up order and half-empty carton of fries. I parked a block away from the hardware store, not wanting Jess or Mrs. Sandborn to see me. I was still angry at Jess and realized what vocalizing my frustrations might lead to. I didn’t want to lose my job for yelling at the boss’s granddaughter. I also felt guilty about the way I treated poor Mrs. Sandborn. She was just a poor old woman looking for… something, just to get yelled at. She didn’t deserve that. She also looked familiar and I was sure my grandfather knew her just like he knew everyone else over 50 in Henderson Falls. It was only a matter of time until she ran into Grandpa, or worse, Mr. Brooks and complained about the rude young man working at the hardware store.

I finished my meal and sat in my car for the rest of my lunch break. My rage abated, leaving me anxious about returning to work. I decided to go into the store bearing an olive branch. I’d apologize to my Jess, maybe offer to cover her shift some weekend and hopefully get through the rest of the day without incident.

I noticed the lack of customers as soon as I stepped into the store. The murmur of questions from customers was replaced by the sound of the overhead heater. I found Jess, hunched over in her usual spot behind the Case knife display. It took a moment to realize Jess wasn’t scroll on her phone or doing homework. She was crying.

“Jess?”

She looked up at me through teary eyes. For the first time, I felt genuinely bad for how I snapped at her.

“I just wanted to say sorry for… earlier.” I stood awkwardly, waiting for her response.

“Why do you hate me Tom?”

“I don’t hate you. I… You’re just a lazy co-worker I have to deal with.”  
I regretted the words as I said them. I felt my anger coming back and tried to keep a cool head.

She sniffled and wiped her eyes with an oversized sweater sleeve. “You never want to talk to me,” she sniffed. “You ignore me all day. You never even say ‘Hi’ to me when I clock in.”

I didn’t know what to say. “Look Jess I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s been a long day. I don’t want to-“

“Don’t want to what? Lose your Job?” She gazed up at me through puffy red eyes.  
“Of course not!”

“We’re both going to lose our jobs, Tom.” Jess buried her head in her arms and burst into fresh sobs. I frowned, confused by the turn the conversation took.

“Why would your grandfather fire you?”

“Because the store is going out of business.” She raised her head up. “Every night, the deposits are getting smaller and smaller. I found these stuffed into grandpa’s ledger.”

She rummaged through the stack of mail beside her and pulled out a stack of envelopes.

“Last Notice, Late Fee, Past Due, Overdrawn.” She slid them from her hand to the desk like she was dealing cards. The sender’s names coupled with the red stamped messages worried me. Henderson County Tax Office, Nibco Plumbing Supply, Third Street Bank, Henderson County Rural Electric, a few miscellaneous suppliers for merchandise not purchased and resold from other stores.

For the life of me I couldn’t figure out why Jess cared so much about the rundown hardware store. She didn’t seem interested in the actual management of the place.I doubted she had hopes of one day running it herself. I remembered her perusing Old Man Brooks’ scrapbook. Maybe it was a matter of familial pride. I dragged my stool closer to Jess and tried to comfort her.

“I know this looks bad, but what’s the worst that can happen? I’ll find a new job somewhere else, and so will you. Mr. Brooks is old enough to retire anyway, don’t you think he’d like to get out of this place and-”

“That’s the thing, Tom. He can’t retire. He puts everything into keeping this place open. Any profit he turns goes right back into paying for more products and paying the bills.” Jess tapped the old-fashioned ledger on her desk. “You know how much money the store has in it’s checking account? It’s less than $100.”

“Just because the store is broke doesn’t mean the Old Man is.”

“Look at your paychecks, Tom Boy”, she said, without her usual mockery. “They don’t say ‘Brooks Bros. Hardware’. They say Simon J. Brooks, because he shares an account with the store.”

I furrowed my brow as I thought. Surely there was a way out of this mess.

“Maybe he can sell the place and walk away with a nice profit. An investor could renovate this building, just like the other ones downtown.”

“Do you *really* think anyone would want to buy this place?” Jess raised a challenging eyebrow.

I shrugged. I knew there were some people buying up the old historic properties and ‘gentrifying’ them. Somehow our dusty hardware store didn’t seem a likely place for coffee, vinyl LPs or whatever else the hipsters downtown liked.

“And even if he could find a buyer, it’d break his heart selling this place. It would absolutely devastate him.”

There was no denying that. Maybe the old man was a bit detached from reality and given to romanticizing the importance of the family business, but I think that made this sudden revelation of the place’s impending demise that much more tragic. I dropped my head as I racked my brain for some words to comfort Jess. Suddenly I felt a warm hand close over my wrist.

“I’ve been reading through some of grandpa’s notes. There might be a way out of this mess, but grandpa would never go through with it.”

I raised my head to see Jess looking at me with pleading eyes. “Will you help me Tom?”

 

My watch read 11:48.

“Do you have everything we need?”

Jess slapped her backpack. “It’s all in here. We just need to get set up before midnight.” She pulled a pink wad of gum from her mouth and smashed it under the desk before rising.

“Let’s go,” she said, wrapping her cold fingers around my hand and dragging me to the foot of the stairs. I felt like a kid reaching into a cookie jar, wondering if they were about to get caught. The wooden stair treads represented the point of no return. If Mr. Brooks or anyone else saw us reason, I’d be caught doing what he explicitly told me to never do.

I clicked my flashlight on, shielding most of the light with my hand. Faint marks left behind by Jess’s Chuck Taylors showed the path through decades of accumulated junk and old merchandise, all but blocking the stairway. I watched Jessica’s long legs retrace steps she had apparently taken earlier. I followed her with my logging boots, trying not to disturb anything. The higher we climbed and the less cluttered the stairs, the more noticeable our footprints became in contrast to the decades of dust. Without all the junk to distract the eye, Mr. Brooks would surely notice this evidence of disturbance.

The door at the landing creaked on rusty hinges. Loose panes of glass rattled as it bumped the lath and plaster wall behind it. The room was exactly as Mr. Brooks described it: an overflow for outdated hardware. Scythes hung from rafters, motheaten burlap bags covered tables, and tendrils of leather straps from horse and carriage days spilled into the narrow walkway. There was even the odd sickle hanging from a nail on the pillars, swaying as our footsteps caused the old floor to creak and at times, noticeably bow under our weight.

Jess picked up her stubby plumber’s candle from floor, leaving behind a small ring of coagulating white wax. We ventured deeper into the musty room. Any doubt surrounding Mr. Brooks’ story of nearly falling through a weak spot in the floor vanished as my flashlight played over the section of splintered wood and exposed floor joists near the front of the store. I realized we might be in real danger of falling through ourselves. Jess led me deeper into the maze of cast-off wares. At one point while, scanning the room I accidentally slammed my knee into the exposed springs of an old mattress sitting on a wrought iron bedframe. I cringed at the rusty squeaks. Jess giggled at my muffled curses. Our narrow walkway gave way to a large clearing. The expanse was mostly unused space. I might have paid more attention to the wall of wooden shelves or the partitioned off room near the front corner of the building but my attention was captured by a hulking rectangular form sitting behind a stained rug.

Gold pinstripes outlining the safe door glittered as we approached. A large, five spoke wheel was mounted beneath the dial. Decades of use had worn through the nickel plating, exposing the brass beneath. The safe’s most striking feature was a portrait of a man’s face painted above a scroll of gilded letters reading: “C. W. Brooks & Bros. HDWE Co. Est. 1868.” Like tintype photographs of the era, his expression was stern, no trace of a grin, and if there was any mirth in his eyes, the artist failed to capture it. I felt a strange uncanniness as I looked at the bearded man’s face, ultimately chalking it up to a family resemblance to my employer. I wondered if the old man had ever seen the portrait of Captain Brooks.

“We don’t have much time,” Jess said. She kicked the red and gold rug away from the safe, revealing a circular, black stain on the floor.

I followed Jess’s lead and knelt on the opposite side of the stain, watching her produce a sheet of onionskin paper and a thin board from her backpack. I sat across from her and clicked off my flashlight before setting it aside. She set her candle to the side illuminating the typewritten paper before unfolding the board in the center of the stain. It featured a row of numbers from zero to ten, the alphabet in capital letters, and the words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in opposite corners. The caption at the top read ‘Ouija’.

“This is what you dragged me up here for? All this over a damn Ouija Board?”

“Look, If you go into this with the wrong mindset, you *will* have a bad time.”

I looked over the thing, half-expecting to find the Hasbro logo on one of the corners, but looking closer, it seemed genuinely old. It wasn’t modern cardboard; it looked more like the antique boxes I found in the warehouse. It had a dull appearance and some of the letters were partially worn away, either due to age or frequent use. I looked at the paper and read the lines closest to me.

1. DO NOT use in a graveyard.
2. Wait until the planchet stops on good-bye to put board away.
3. If the board starts counting down from-

“Or it might not work at all,” Jess interrupted, tilting her head to one side. “And we’ll have wasted all this time for nothing.”

“Alright, fine. Where’d you get this thing anyway?”

“Kathy Connors. She gave me these instructions, board and planchet for the ritual,” she continued, holding up a wooden pointer and setting it down on the board. I frowned. It hadn’t occurred to me before agreeing to do this, honestly, I wasn’t sure what I had agreed to at all. The only thing Jess told me was the key to saving our jobs and her grandfather’s business was upstairs and that she needed help. I can’t explain it, but I felt sudden apprehension looking at the board, sitting on the blackened circle in the candle light. It rekindled a distant memory, maybe one of those humid summer mornings in the itchy pews of Henderson Falls’ First Baptist Church and a vague recollection of my pastor going on about divination not only being a sin, but the very act putting your soul at risk of demonic possession. It was unsettling to say the least.

There was also the time Kyle told me spirit boards were ‘complete bullshit’ after we saw one being used in a horror movie.

“There’s a reason they always say to never play alone,” he said as the B-Movie we pirated flickered on the projector in his basement. “If you did, there’d be nobody to move that wooden thing.”

All that said, I felt reluctance at the thought of taking part in what basically amounted to a séance. I pushed these thoughts from my mind. If Jess really wanted to go to all this trouble just to sit cross-legged on the floor and wait for a message from beyond the ethers that wasn’t coming, that was on her.

With everything in order, Jess closed her eyes and took a deep breath before looking up at me.

“Are you ready?”

“I guess? What are we doing exactly?”

“Using a Ouija board.”

“I got that part, but why?”

She groaned as she looked at her Apple watch. “Look, we have five minutes, so I’ll make this quick. Has grandpa told you about the feud between Captain Brooks and the banker G. W. Leyland?”

“Maybe once or twice.”

Jess just stared at me, expecting more. By this time, I doubted there was anything about Captain Brooks the Old Man hadn’t told me about.

“He said something about Leyland and the Captain having a feud, or something?”

Jess nodded. “He probably didn’t mention Leyland’s attempt to take over Brooks Brothers?”

“No, he didn’t.”

“I read Captain Brooks’ Journal.” Jess gestured to the leather book poking out of her backpack, the same one I’d seen her reading many times before.

“During the Panic of 1873, the store fell on hard times and needed loans to stay open. Leyland was a money lender and the two agreed to a loan in exchange for a promissory note, payable once Captain Brooks’ railroad investments recovered. It’s complicated, but after several months, Layland attempted to claim Brooks Brothers for the loan being in default. The Captain claimed Leyland forged a promissory note with different terms and even caught Leyland trying to force his way into the offices up here. There was also money missing after this visit from Leyland. The whole thing went to court and the Judge ruled in favor of a compromise between the two versions of the promissory note, since he himself couldn’t verify which one was real. Brooks Brothers was ordered to repay half the loan immediately and the remaining half upon the later note’s expiration. The store struggled after paying the first half of the loan. Rumors circulated about the Brooks family losing the store when Leyland called on the rest of the loan, and that’s when something strange happened: He never came. He went missing, days before the rest of the loan was due. People were initially suspicious of Captain Brooks, but he had an air-tight alibi. Other businesses in town came forward after his disappearance, claiming Leyland was guilty of unfair and misleading business practices, hidden balloon payments on loans, forced early repayment, interfering with businesses he’d loaned money to and trying to assume control of them. People started to think Leyland had made too many enemies in town and fled. After this, Captain Brooks’ journal entries seem to get… paranoid. He mentioned his fear of Leyland’s return. He changed the combination to the safe and wouldn’t tell anyone, not even his family what it was. He carried a revolver with him and insisted on locking the store himself each night. This went on a few months before he was found dead on this very spot.”

Jess pointed to the black stain. My skin crawled under my coat.

“What happened?”

“No one knew for sure. The coroner said it was heart failure. After witnessing his paranoia, the family probably believed it.”

“And you want to try asking his spirit for the combination to open this safe?”

“You’re really not as dumb as you look, Tommy Boy.”

“Why go to all this trouble? If there was anything in that safe, someone would have hired a locksmith a long time ago.”

“It’s a Chubbs Safe, whey were world famous their security. They used to say they were impossible to crack. I called around, but none of the locksmiths around here will touch it because it’s an antique. I found a man online who works on old safes, but he was expensive.”

“How expensive?”

“More than we make in a month.”

“Did you call and talk to the guy? Maybe he’s cheaper than you think. Or mayb-”

Jess looked at her watch. “Look, we don’t have much time, just give me your hand.”

I sighed and placed my hand on top of the planchet.

“One last thing.” Jess looked me in the eye. Her perpetual smirk vanished and her laughing eyes grew calm and focused.

“You have to promise, once we start, we keep going until the end? You got me?”

I nodded.

“And it doesn’t end until the planchet says ‘Goodbye’.”

“Alright.”

“Promise me.”

“Alright, I promise.”

“Good.” Jess rested her soft hand on top of mine. A cold handcuff bit my wrist as it ratcheted shut. I looked at the other end of the handcuff dangling from Jess’s wrist. Before I could speak she raised her free hand, dismissively.

“Just some cheap insurance,” she said.

“Insurance against what?”

Jess’s watch alarm chimed. Midnight. She straightened up and whispered, “Let me do the talking.” She slid the planchet to the center of the board.

“Is there a benevolent spirit who wishes to speak with the living?”

Jess scanned the darkness beyond our candle’s flickering light. A long silence passed before she spoke again.

“I am one of Captain Brooks’ granddaughters; is there a benevolent spirit who wishes to speak with the living?”

Wind whistled outside. The building’s roof creaked under the strain. The planchet remained a dead piece of wood in our hands. I looked around the room and saw nothing. Jess looked over my shoulder once more. Biting her lip, Jess spoke up.

“I am a descendant of Captain Brooks; is there a spirit who wishes to speak with the living?”

My heart thudded inside my chest. It wasn’t the wind picking up outside, or the sudden chill in the air, or Jess trembling across from me. It was the planchet moving. Not under the guidance of Jess’s hand, or mine, but some invisible force. It slid slowly to the word “Yes”, before returning to the center of the board.

Jess went pale, but smiled uneasily. “Who are we speaking with?”

The pointer skated across the board, spelling out a message.

“Captain Brooks.”

Jess’s face lit up with triumph. “We came to ask you-”

But the planchet kept moving “You shouldn’t be here Jess. He got me, now he’s coming for you. Leave now.”

The pointer moved towards ‘Goodbye’. It was nearly there when it shot back to the center of the board. Heavy footfalls echoed through the room.

Jess shook her head in stunned silence.

I scanned the room but saw nothing. “Who’s there?”

The board spelled out “Leyland.”

“We’re here on behalf of Mr. Brooks.” Jess shuddered as she spoke.

“Another Brooks in financial trouble. How predicable.”

Jess wiped tears from her eyes before speaking. “Mr. Leyland, I know you and the captain had- difficulties. But we need help opening the safe.”

A cold breeze burst through the room, carrying a madman’s laugh. Our weak light source trembled, sputtering and threatening to go out until the gust exhausted itself and the flame steadied.

“I help no one. Especially a Brooks.”

“Mr. Leyland, please it’s a matter of saving my grandfather’s business.”

The wind rose up again. A raspy voice vocalized the board’s words slowly as the planchet spelled them out.

“This is my business.”

Jess sat speechless. Before she could speak the cursor and the voice went on.

“When I came to call on Captain Brooks’s loan, he murdered me on this very spot.”

A chill ran down my spine. I looked at the stain beneath us, suspecting for the first time it wasn’t from a water leak or spilled ink. Images of a banker dying, a safe slamming shut, and the smell of black powder smoke flashed through my mind.

“What does any of this have to do with me?” Jess cried.

“You’re family owed me a debt in life. I’m here to collect after death.”

“He can’t hurt us? Can he,” I asked. Trying not to panic.

Wicked laughter echoed through the room.

Jess looked faint when her eyes fell on Kathy Connors’ sheet of paper.

“What’s wrong,” the voice taunted. “Didn’t anyone tell you not to play in a graveyard?”

A faint metallic whir alerted us to the safe towering above us. The dial raced from one digit of it’s combination to another before stopping with a click. The five spoke wheel twisted, stopping with a metallic ‘thunk’ as the locking bars retracted. The massive door swung open on lazy hinges. Jess saw it before I did and screamed.

Inside was the dried-up husk of a man, still in a gilded age suit. Yellow wrinkled lips curled away from ivory white teeth as it stared at us with sunken, hollow eye sockets.

“Don’t you think there was a reason the captain never gave anyone the combination to this safe?”  
Jess sobbed, her pale face reddened from crying. “You don’t have to do this. I never borrowed anything from you.”

“Captain Brooks’ debt will be repaid.”

Disembodied laughter echoed through the room. The open safe swayed with each reverberation. The planchet jerked to nine and started counting down. Eight. Seven.

“It can’t get to zero, Tom! Help me!” Each time the planchet moved, we forced it back to the previous number. The resistance was startlingly strong as we shoved it back to nine. I don’t know what scared me more, not knowing what would happen if it reached zero or the fact its movements were getting harder to fight. Even with both of our hands on the thing, shoving with all our might we were losing ground. Six, five, four. The safe rocked noticeably. The floor creaked under its weight.

Jess looked to the sheet of paper, searching frantically for some way out of this. The pointer stopped on four. I braced myself and pulled with all my might. It needled closer to three but I wasn’t about to let it get there. I wasn’t just fighting the planchet, I was fighting panic, a tired grip, sweaty hands. The safe shook violently next to us. I cried out in pain as the planchet ripped free from my fingers.  

Three. Two. One.

Before it could get to zero, Jess flipped the board upside down.

“Tom, look out!”

 The handcuff bit into my wrist as Jess lunged from our circle of light, dragging me with her. The candle got knocked over, plunging us into darkness. A deafening crash rattled the bones of the building as the safe fell face first to the floor where Jess and I were sitting just moments before. Before we could share this moment of relief, a blackened figure rose from behind ruins of the safe.  ",1,1740876079.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Erin sat in a waiting room, nervously bouncing his leg in wait as he held himself in his arms. It must’ve been... what, a year since he last spoke with someone? Now here he was, not only needing to hold up a conversation, but one that specifically focuses on his problems. 



The light flickered, buzzing above to choke out the agonizing silence. Erin never liked the silence; the lack of stimulation would always invite his mind to wander into uncharted waters, pools that he was never comfortable in. 



The door gently opened to reveal an older woman, a smaller figure with a clipboard up to her chest, “Mr. Naciodi?” 



Erin’s grip on himself tightened slightly as he stood, “Yeah... that’s me.” 



Erin was led into a different room. While it was smaller, the more restrained decoration made it feel less suffocating. In the center was a plush chair across from a couch, a round coffee table between them. The table had a miniature Zen Garden with a little rake, a multicolored Rubix cube, and a mirror.



The woman sat on the plush seat, motioning for Erin to sit with her, “My name is Ms. Phillips. I’m glad you’ve decided to come here today, everyone deserves a chance to seek comfort.” 

Erin collapsed onto the couch. His movements were loose, like a puppet attempting to maneuver its own strings, “I... thought it would be better than... doing nothing.” He saw his reflection in the mirror, scowling slightly as he laid the glass face down. 



Ms. Phillips noted this behavior, jotting it down on her notepad, “Well, you know what they say, its more honorable to act than live life doing nothing.” She gave a gentle smile, eyes crinkling in the corners. “So, why don’t you tell me a little about yourself?” 



Erin grabbed the Rubix cube from the coffee table, rotating the sides and admiring the imperfect faces, “Well, my name’s... Erin Naciodi, but I guess you already knew that. I... don’t have a lot, but I like running, at least.” Erin paused, feeling the box’s edge in his palm, “Usually, I just try not to think about myself. But... it’s getting worse, and I couldn’t take it anymore. So, when I heard you were doing free appointments today... I decided to try.” 



Ms. Phillips nodded along as Erin spoke about himself. She noticed the tattoos of his skin cracking on his forearms as if it were made of porcelain, “What about those marks? Do they mean anything to you?” 



“Huh? Oh... yeah, those. They’re just... it’s like when people say they crack under pressure, this is like my version of that.” 



“Ah, I see. So, you enjoy expressing yourself via tattoos?” 



Erin stammers a little, rotating the sides of the Rubix cube a little faster before responding, “I... guess so. I see people walking on the streets with family names and bible verses on them so... I- I guess I figured this was my version of that.” 



Ms. Phillips nodded along, writing whatever she deemed important, ""Now, tell me about your day-to-day life. What do you do every day? Do you take good care of yourself?""



""I... I get up at... around five to nine. I drag out of bed, eat whatever I have lying around, then go around town... doing whatever."" Erin scratched at his wrist as he spoke, before going back to the cube. He rotated the faces quickly, but they lacked the coordination and precision of a professional, just blitzing around with seemingly no end goal in mind.



Ms. Phillips looked up from her notes, ""That's a wide range, are you sure you sleep well? Do you have restless nights frequently?""



Erin didn't answer for an uncomfortable amount of time. It felt like eons passed before he spoke, ""I don't remember. Every day just... feels like a hazy mess. I can't control anything I do, like I'm a spectator in my own life. Sometimes, I can't tell if I'm not myself.""



Ms. Phillips' brow rose a little at his description, ""What do you mean? You don't feel like yourself?""



""It's just... You know that feeling when you die in your nightmares? You jolt awake, looking around to find out what's real and not? You can't differentiate yourself from... the one in your dreams, and it's like someone acts for you without asking? That's... how I feel, every moment of every day.”



""I think you have a serious problem, Erin,"" explained Ms. Phillips, ""It sounds like you're carrying a lot of mental weight. Do you remember when this started, when you stopped feeling entirely like yourself?""



Erin's grip on the Rubix cube tightened slightly, the muscles in his neck tensing, ""When I was around six. After I lost my parents, I went to some foster care thing. It was awful. I was 'different', so they kept me separated from the others. They'd pick at me with needles, acting like I was some vile monster for even existing. I had no one to talk to, I wasn't even really allowed to move. So, I had to talk with myself, in my head, for almost ten years. Then, after I broke out, the voices I spoke with followed me, becoming more insistent and wanting to make themselves known. Because of them, I haven't known peace in five years.""



The room hung in a silent hum, the only sound coming from the revolving ceiling fan. Erin stared blankly, eyes focused on nothing, Rubix cube inching closer to its perfected state, so close but still all too far. Ms. Phillips' pen flew along the page on which it scribed, noting this new revelation for her private records.



""Erin,"" she began, ""I think you carry more emotional baggage than you realize. It sounds like you're struggling with your identity, and these 'voices' are your outlet for your frustrations and trauma.""



Erin's eye twitched as Ms. Phillips continued to explain, ""When someone experiences a traumatic event, such as your own, at a young age, their mind may try to take a backseat as a coping mechanism, to avoid the trouble of handling their own struggles. It may be too early to say for sure, but it sounds like you suffer from this same case. I can see the physical toll it takes on you, and I think you came at the right time before it worsened.""



Erin took a while to answer. His gaze drifted off, twitching and flickering in a few different directions, not sure if it was right to answer. His eyes shifted, their pale blue color almost seeming to turn dull grey, ""Sometimes, I wonder why I'm even alive... I saw my parents die right in front of me, when our home burned down. I see them every time I close my eyes, watching me... judging me from the grave.”



The sides of the cube began drifting from their set path to perfection, going from just needing 1 more matching square on each side, to the colors now fighting for their face to be known, pinks fighting purples and blues commanding whites, ""I've been wanting my existence to end so I can be free of this hell, but I'm scared to die... because when I do, I'll see them, and be condemned to their judgement for the rest of time.""



Ms. Phillips' brows furrowed slightly at Erin's admission. She thought over her next words carefully, reaching across the table to grab the mirror Erin laid on its face earlier. She propped it back up in his direction, the reflective side shining clear as day, ""You love your parents, and you want to be the perfect son for them. But that desire for perfection is breaking you, and it’s starting to show. Let's focus on you, and what you think of yourself. Look in the mirror, what do you see?""



Erin froze, turning lazily to face the mirror, eyes dulled with self-pity, the hues drifting into a restricting purple, ""...Nothing. I can't pinpoint my face in there. I see one... but it doesn't feel like me.""



Ms. Phillips nodded along. She put her notepad down on the coffee table, trying to meet Erin's gaze, ""You are struggling with your self-worth, aren't you? It sounds like you're letting these voices become more prevalent than you in your own life. And, from what little I can see, it sounds like they're suffering too. I want to help you, Erin, if you'll allow me. Now, what else happened in your life that left you like this? Is there anything else you're comfortable telling me?""



Erin kept staring into the mirror, his gaze meeting that of the figure looking back at him. His mind flashed back to everything; the deaths of his parents, the sting of the needles... the electric shocks from the machine he was hooked up to, the burning sensations in his head as they tried to subdue him, the thrill of breaking everyone who wronged him, the rush from destroying everyone who faced him in the alleys, all for the sake of survival. He was the victor-made monster, but no matter how many times he said he was happy with it, he knew better. They all did.



""...No. Not right now.""



Ms. Phillips sighed a little, nodding. She glanced at the clock mounted on the wall, the gentle ticks keeping their consistent pace, ""We're almost out of time today, but let's try something before we call it.""



Ms. Phillips flipped through her notepad, sliding it closer to Erin with the pen resting atop a blank page, ""You say you don't recognize yourself in the mirror, that when you look, you see someone else entirely. How about you try your best to show me what you saw?""



Erin stared at the page for a moment. He put down the Rubix cube, exchanging it for the pen and paper on the table. He scribbled around in silence, eyes darting around to make sure it was accurate. His leg bounced up and down, rhythm fluctuating between varying degrees of speed. His eye would twitch every few moments, looking up in thought, before nodding or shaking his head.



After some time, he slid the notepad over to Ms. Phillips, the pen rolling over slightly as it suddenly stopped.



She studied the humanoid figure, reading its wide-open lids, the veins cracking into the iris. The scars seemed to burn into the remaining eye, the voided right socket hazy and bagged. The sides of where the mouth should've been were axed into a vague smile, and the charred horns atop the head stabbed through flesh like shattered bone.



Ms. Phillips nods after observing the figure, ""So this is who you see?""



Erin nodded slowly, ""It's... who I see right now. In an hour, I'll see someone else... then again in another hour. And after that...""



Ms. Phillips nodded, picking up the notepad and carefully pulling out the page. She shut the notepad, holding the page to her clipboard from the beginning of the session, ""I'm going to hang onto this. I want you to keep coming back every week, at no charge, so we can work on your lack of identity. I'm going to help you work on yourself, until you can finally see who you really are.""



Ms. Phillips rose to her feet, going over to a filing cabinet in the corner of the room. She placed the sheet into one of the folders inside, shutting the drawer and turning to Erin, who was back to fidgeting with the Rubix cube, “That’s all our time today. This next week, I want you to try and work on taking care of yourself. Ease off insulting and try and replace all that negative thought with something healthier.”



Erin nodded, rubbing his eyes a little. He put the Rubix cube down on the table, the sides having finally aligned after an hour of fidgeting and mindless rotation. He stole one last glare into the mirror, sifting the well of details, before shaking his head and heading to the door, “T- thank you… we’ll see you later.”



Erin left the office, taking a few deep breaths as he stood out under the sun. He felt the world slow down around him, instinctively assessing the surrounding space. The cracks in his arms began to recede as he tried to listen to the cacophony of wails in his mind.



After all he’d gone through, he had lost hope that he’d ever know peace, that he’d be condemned to the crossfire of his restless sides for the rest of his life.



But, for the first time in a long time, he felt the conflict fall silent. All he felt were the dazed glares shared between them, the heart and mind finding brief middle ground.



He wasn’t entirely sure yet, but if the one session could help achieve this blooming clarity… maybe he had a chance after all.

there's a property i've been looking at just outside Atenas. $280k but probably could come down further. self sustainable with rain collection/storage, independent power grid, garden with veggies, fruits, coffee, and herbs. it's got two structures on it - a 3/3 up the slope and a open room round house lower down. thinking of making the round house a backpacking/hostel sort of situation. 

i have never purchased property/house in america, and honestly i don't want to. i've been considering ex-pat for at least 20 years now, and Costa Rica is one of my favorite gems of the world. so it only makes sense. 

i know CR is weloming to ex-pat americans, but i've no idea what the process would look like. 

what does the down payment look like? is it 20% like it is in america? are there any loans for first time home buyers (like in america)? what does a loan in a foreign country even look like? could i get a loan in USD in america and use that to purchase the property outright? or would it be best to get a loan in COL? 

any advice? once again, not interested in the ""don't do it"" crowd. but i definitely want the good and the bad.

I need advice. My 41-year-old husband is fully reintegrated to the point where no matter what we’re talking about, it all leads back to the show. Dinner? “You know, the break room scene really explores the concept of sustenance in a capitalist framework.” I told him we were out of milk, and he said, ‘Wow, like when they ran out of coffee creamer on the severed floor—just another way corporate keeps us in line.’” 

I tried bringing up our weekend plans, and he said, “That reminds me of when Mark is torn between his two realities.” I told him my back hurt, and he launched into a monologue about the burden of corporate trauma. I think if I told him I was leaving him, he’d just say, “Wow, like when Helly—”

So now I’m thinking: If I want him to actually listen to me like he did before season 2 started, I need to start framing everything in Severance terms. Like, “Hey babe, when we go to Costco, imagine it’s like Macrodata Refinement, and our job is to keep the cart under $200.” Or “Could you take the trash out? Consider it your Waffle Party.”

Just got it if you days ago. I have 3420 which I know is like the same machine but I got an okay tax return so I figured I'd give this one to my mom and get the 3630 because I like the color and upgrade all the rest of my gear so that I could really make actual espresso. 

Now, most of my stuff is cheap. I got a lot of my tools off of AliExpress. I got a king grinder K2, and some generic tamper, MHW3 bomber puck filter, and IMS basket, and some generic portafilters one had the two spouts at the bottom and one was bottomless. So I know it's not a great setup, but I've seen people online pull good shots with similar stuff. 

Now when I was using the pressurized basket, I always just assumed you were supposed to use both of the little shot glasses that came with fill them both up pouring both in your cup. I guess I will say that it's not like a coffee cup it's more of like a 16 oz tumbler or something. And I made some stuff that tasted pretty good I thought and did that for years before buying all this stuff. But even after having trouble fitting the grounds into the basket, which I'm not sure why. I am pretty sure I bought an 18 gram basket, but when I pour the grounds in it's like a mountain over it and it almost fills up to the top of the funnel so maybe I'm a crazy person and didn't order the right basket. Anyways, even after having trouble with that, and having cheap beans ( All I could really afford at the moment was Pete's) and having a fairly fast shot that was mostly just dark, mixing my drink together and taking the first sip, was just something else. 

Like, I knew that it was going to be more intense and probably more flavorful making real espresso, but I was just not prepared for how much better it would taste. I can actually taste these notes that people keep talking about when they taste coffee and stuff and it's crazy. And it's even crazier to think that I didn't even pull a good shot and already it's so much more delicious. I do kind of regret buying the double spout portafilter though because apparently you're not supposed to fill up both of the glasses cuz 36 g is only one glass and not even full, so honestly I don't even know how big of a basket I would need to fill up both of the little shot glasses for the double pour. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this if you got all the way through. Not really anything of note, but just excited to be making espresso finally, and super surprised at how different it actually is then what I was previously making, and thought was fairly close to espresso. I will note that I was also not grinding my own beans before so it's kind of like a double whammy when it comes to quality jump I'm sure.",1,1740874612.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

P.s if you have any questions I’m happy to answer them. 

Day 1 on Lithium, 300 mg, Feb 18, 2025Started lithium today—300 mg, as prescribed. The doctor wants me on 600 mg eventually, but I’m easing in. Barely slept last night, maybe 4 or 5 hours if I’m lucky—same as it’s been for ages. Two years of this exhaustion, and I’m hoping this med changes something. Felt off all day, though. Went for breakfast, but dizziness hit hard—could barely stand straight. Laid down after, and it eased up a bit. Sweated through my sheets last night, woke up drenched. Temper’s still a mess—snapped at Megan over nothing, just pure rage spilling out. Mania’s been creeping in too, unstoppable once it starts. That’s why I’m here, trying this. No clue if it’ll work, but I’m desperate. Side effects aren’t great so far—dizzy, sweaty, irritable. Hoping my body adjusts.

Day 2 on Lithium, 300 mg, Feb 19, 2025Second day on 300 mg. Slept a little more—maybe 6 hours—but still woke up early, feeling like I’d run a marathon in my sleep. Sheets soaked again; it’s gross. Breakfast was rough—dizziness still there, though not as bad as yesterday. Lying down helps, but I can’t just stay in bed all day. Temper’s worse, if anything. Yelled at someone over a tiny delay—can’t even remember what. It’s like the lithium’s making me more prickly, or maybe it’s just my body fighting it. Mania’s lurking; I can feel it bubbling. Rage feels closer to the surface, not locked up like I’d hoped. Still, it’s early—doctor says give it time. Sticking with 300 mg for now, scared to jump to 600 mg yet. Will see how tomorrow goes.

Day 3 on Lithium, 300 mg, Feb 21, 2025Slept 12 hrs last night—catching up on nearly 2 yrs of barely sleeping (45 hrs some weeks, 5-6 max). Woke up early. Big breakfast, still dizzy when standing, but better than Days 1-2. Sweating a ton at night—sheets soaked, like I showered and didn’t dry off. Temper’s rough—snapping instantly over small stuff, like a late order. Poor Megan gets the worst of it—unfiltered rage. Mania’s full-on once it starts; nothing else locks it up. Hoping lithium does. On 300 mg, body’s adjusting—temper’s strong, but maybe it’s settling. Doc wants 600 mg; I might try tonight.

Day 4 on Lithium, 300 mg (increasing to 600 mg tonight), Sertraline 100 mg, Feb 22, 2025Held at 300 mg last night, took a sleeping pill. Woke up okay, still irritable but processing a bit before reacting—placebo? Took 300 mg AM, will add 300 mg PM for 600 mg total, per doc. Tired, no dizziness, some diarrhea, dry mouth/lips. Drinking water, will get Gatorade. Sleeping pill sleep was meh—lithium alone’s better. Sertraline up to 100 mg tonight from 50 mg. We’ll see.

Day 8 on Lithium 600 mg, Sertraline 300 mg, Lamotrigine 200 mg, Feb 26, 2025First day noticing a shift—not huge, just “that didn’t piss me off today.” Married Megan yesterday! Dismantled bed, ditched mattresses—normally maddening, but I was fine. Still volatile—left family WhatsApp to avoid regretful outbursts. Parents check with Megan; they’re visiting China in 3 weeks. Meds: 600 mg lithium, 300 mg sertraline (100 mg AM, 200 mg PM), 200 mg lamotrigine (100 mg AM/PM). Not healed, but a start.

Day 9 on Lithium 600 mg, Sertraline 300 mg, Lamotrigine 200 mg, Feb 27, 2025Great day! Coffee grinder mess—rage bubbled, then vanished; I laughed. New Logitech gear’s awesome. No smoking/drinking since meds. Sertraline to 400 mg tomorrow. Spending’s bad—need to save. Sex drive’s low, less promiscuous. Dodged a past flame—staying loyal to Megan.

Day 10 on Lithium 600 mg, Sertraline 300 mg, Lamotrigine 200 mg, Feb 28, 2025

Started the morning rough—things nearly pushed me to boiling rage: blowing my nose, someone taking food for Cassie (I’ve asked them to leave it with the other cats’ food), Number Five cleaning himself (BIG rage—the most disgusting sound ever), and the delivery driver being 30 minutes late. Took 2 sertraline tablets this morning instead of 1—horrible mistake. Slept all day, heart palpitations were awful. Lithium side effects are way better than sertraline’s. Not every day will be great—10 days in, I can’t expect miracles. I know pills alone won’t fix me; I have to work at it, and I will. Glad I’ve noticed positives—like when my dad didn’t pick up my call because he was busy, I didn’t block him childishly. Processed it like an adult: “He’s just busy, he’ll chat later.” Still on 600 mg lithium, 300 mg sertraline (2 AM, 1 PM today, but tomorrow back to 1 AM, 2 PM—aiming for 2 and 2 when my body adjusts), and lamotrigine steady at 100 mg AM, 100 mg PM. Noticed bloating too—I’m a bit fat, but not this big. I look like I drink beer all day, so I’ll talk to my doctor about it.

Day 11 on Lithium 600 mg, Sertraline 300 mg, Lamotrigine 400 mg, March 1, 2025Today was rough. Still on 600 mg lithium, 300 mg sertraline, and now 400 mg lamotrigine (200 mg AM, 200 mg PM). Bloods today showed 0.28 for lithium; doc says it’s good, wants me to go to 900 mg tomorrow (300 mg AM, 600 mg PM) for a week, then reassess. Sertraline bumps to 400 mg tomorrow too. Luke (my cat) went to the hospital—low white blood cells, tied to my stress; he’s so attached to me, it’s a soul bond. When I’m upset, he is too. He’s not doing well, and it’s my fault—doc said so. Lost my temper multiple times—yelled at family in the car, emotional mess. Booked a psychiatrist in Shanghai; parents might come sooner. Couldn’t stay home with Megan—checked into a hotel to protect us both. Living like this is hell—ups and downs, no stability. One minute I’m fine, the next I’m a loaded gun; Megan takes the brunt. It’s like a bomb—nothing personal, just collateral damage. I take responsibility, I’m trying to get better. Unblocked family—I need their love. Seeing Megan for breakfast tomorrow—I miss her, love her, hate hurting her. Sexually, I feel nothing; it’s straining her—I’m usually so sexual, but now I barely watch porn (1-2 times/week). It’s good I quit drinking/smoking, but today sucked. My cats—Luke, Bo, Kitler, Cassidy—I love them. Megan’s dog, Number Five, I can’t stand—sounds, smells—I feel bad for her. Want to be better for her, my family, my cats. Tired of this rollercoaster—900 mg lithium and 400 mg sertraline start tomorrow, let’s see.",1,1740874475.0,Lithium,0,1.0,False

I seemingly can only find the “craft beer” equivalent out here - an expensive shop styled with lots of wood and brass, but with a mediocre $60 haircut from a kid or a stylist who used to work at Great Clips. 

Where is the cranky old man barber, often cash only, with a bunch of dudes sitting around, drinking coffee and reading the newspaper? Where is the dude who’s been cutting hair for 30 years? 

I only ever want a classic side-part, clean-cut haircut. I often end up with weird side parts cut into my hair, shitty tapers and an overall suboptimal haircut. 

Please drop your recs for your favorite neighborhood barber. I’m willing to drive 20-30 mins in any direction from the DG/lombard area. I have been searching across different review apps to no avail. ",7,1740874116.0,ChicagoSuburbs,9,0.89,False

# Excerpt

I look for your name in the Book of Life. The script is cryptic, cloudy, ever mutating, in a language only She can read. I’ve tried to decipher it, to learn where our story ends, but it eludes me. Not that you need to know that, my dear. 

I set the book down and re-watch the Earth Observation Files. The past, at least, is crystalline clear. When I caught wind of your cooperation with the foul demon, I had hoped it was a ruse, a con to lure it closer, only to vanquish it when it least suspected. But as time wore on, I was forced to reach an entirely different conclusion. You talk to it, like it is equal to you, like it deserves your attention, your beatific smiles, your angelic grace. She gave that to you, and here you are wasting it on a demon! A demon who could never return your affection, even if it wanted to. I will concede that it is quite pretty to look at. Perhaps the way it appears to bend your every whim is what you find so enticing. So enticing, you ignore common sense and fail to see how it is deceiving you.

Background 
- 25F raised in US my entire life, originally from South Asia. 
- Went back to visit home country, talked to a guy (27M) on apps didn’t go anywhere, he comes to Canada a year later and we start talking casually. 
- After a couple months we decide to meet in Canada, he can’t come here (visa issues) so I go. We split the costs. Rinse and repeat 5 more times through the next year. 
- I’ll preface though that I hate ldr, they suck, I’ve never seen them work and as someone with ADHD and depression, it sucks even more. I start to feel distant from people I’m not physically near, I get super sad, and in the deep depths of episodes all I need is my person. 

Rules
- But we fell fast and hard for each other. I decided to not give any labels for now, I stated that we would not be an official thing till he was able to secure his visa and set foot in the US. 
- Another thing was that we’d visit each other every 2-3 months, alternating once he got his visa, so it’s just been me visiting till now. My mom has even visited him once with me.  

Family 
- My family likes him, but not the biggest fans due to differences in socioeconomic status but they have never said anything negative. 
- My friends, however, have been vocal. 
- Main concern they all have is that’s he’s behind in life at 27, never worked a “real job” ie corporate, and just finishing post-grad now. 
- I’ve advocated for him at every step: he’s gone through a lot in life, he’s trying his best, I know he’ll do something etc. 
- Coming to a new country, being alone, it’s hard so I’ve done everything I can to help.
- Helped him look for jobs, actually calling people I knew and even my mom too with her contacts in Canada, lent money, paid more than my share for my visits, sent him books, guided him on his career step by step how to get there from editing his resume to setting up goal trackers. 

Why him? 
- He’s sweet. He’s kind. Incredibly so, at least from what I’ve felt. 
- He takes care of me, reminds me to take my medicine, take my contacts out, dumb stuff like that 
- He makes me feel beautiful (body image issues). 
- Idk what but something about him just makes me like holding on, or maybe I just want to fix him. 😭 (friends theory) 

Me
- I’m a gifts and acts of services girly
- Love big surprises, surprises in general
- I’ve never gotten that from him, but I know if he had the money to do so he probably would. 
- Something about him makes me happy even just getting some flowers or chocolates
- This is all coming from a girl who’s never even paid for her own coffee date before so I shocked even myself. 
- I love giving gifts and surprises too!!
- I’ve remotely planned and thrown him a surprise birthday through his friends, Uber him food whenever he’s sad, take him suitcase full of snacks and home cooked meals by mom when I visit, decorated his room for Christmas, for his birthday, flew out last minute to visit him when he was feeling down. 
- At this point, even I know I’ve done a lot. 

The problems
- Common theme to fights include lack of effort in his work. I want him to be passionate and work hard.  
- Another fight we had last year was when he didn’t do anything “big” on my birthday. I don’t mean buy me a car, I mean send a gift, some flowers, write a poem, make a card, something, anything that shows EFFORT. 
- I chocked it up to him being new to relationships (only his second), he made up for it on valentines. 
- This year my birthday and valentines rolls in, he sends me a few small gifts and a cake. Made me happy. 

The Big Fights #1
- Valentines rolls in, sends me chocolates on chocolates day and flowers for rose day, so I expected something cute for the actual Valentine’s Day. 
- Nothing. He got me nothing. I was gutted. He thought the other two things were enough? We had a big fight, I was hurt, embarrassed even, and just wallowed seeing everyone get pampered all day. 

The Big Fights #2
- Fast forward— finally got his US visa
- I was elated. My family was elated. My mom’s asking every other day when he’s visiting.
- His plan was to visit his sister, who he hasn’t seen in 5+ years, next month. Then come visit me a month later. Family comes first for us both, so I understood the delay.
- The last few weeks have been rough. Work, health, financial, emotional, everything. 
- I’ve had 4+ panic attacks in the last two weeks, during one I cried and told him how much I miss him. How it practically physically hurts. I practically begged him to add a day or two to visit, even if meant he didn’t visit the month after. 
- He didn’t really comment on it but did soothe me. 
- This week he tells me he was trying to change the ticket to see if he could come for two days but the airline refused. It was going to be the “big surprise” for me that I’ve wanted. 
- He has a tendency to give up easy But I loved the thought, and told him he could just buy another ticket from his sister to here and home (~$120 total). 
- We’ve had this convo so many times, EFFORT > THOUGHTS. He says he’ll think on it. 
- Informs me that his sister doesn’t think it’s smart to let 1/2 the original ticket go to waste and it’s too hectic so he could just visit another time. 
- Mind you, they know all I’ve done for him, especially his sister. I’m hurt he didn’t fight for me, point out how much I’ve done, how much I need him rn. 
- Instead today he tells me his sister is mad at him now bc of him telling her that he wants to visit me. 


Final nail in the coffin: today he texted that he never said he wasn’t going to come, he’ll just come in April. “That was what we originally planned anyway.”


I’m torn, the practical side is saying I deserve better and my emotional anxious attached side is saying maybe I’m asking for too much 😭



SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME AIO FOR BEING MAD OR AM I BEING MANIPULATED LIKE A FOOL?

Super excited to share a cool little tool I just whipped up called **Outlook Calendar MCP** \- it basically gives Claude superpowers to peek into and manage your Microsoft Outlook calendar right from your Windows PC!

# What's this thing do?

It's a bridge that connects Claude (both the desktop app and VSCode extension) with your local Windows Outlook calendar. Now Claude can actually schedule that meeting you're talking about instead of just pretending it did! And the best part? Your calendar data stays right where it belongs - on your computer.

# The Cool Stuff It Can Do

* **See Your Schedule**: ""Hey Claude, what's on my calendar tomorrow?"" Actually works now!
* **Book Meetings**: Create new events, invite people, the whole shebang
* **Find Free Time**: ""When am I actually free this week?"" Claude knows!
* **Juggle Multiple Calendars**: Work, personal, ""secret projects"" - Claude can access them all
* **Privacy First**: No sending your schedule to the cloud - everything happens locally

# How It Actually Works

Behind the scenes, it uses VBScript to talk to Outlook and wraps everything in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that Claude understands. Magic! ✨    

# MCP Configuration

Add this to your Claude config file and you're in business:

    {
      ""mcpServers"": {
        ""outlook-calendar"": {
          ""command"": ""npx"",
          ""args"": [""-y"", ""outlook-calendar-mcp""],
          ""env"": {}
        }
      }
    }
    

# Fun Things to Ask Claude Now

* ""Got anything exciting on my calendar today?""
* ""Schedule a coffee chat with Sarah for sometime when I'm not drowning in meetings""
* ""Find me a free slot for a mental health break this afternoon""
* ""That boring meeting tomorrow? Move it to next week, please!""

# You'll Need

* Windows PC (sorry Mac folks!)
* Microsoft Outlook desktop app installed
* Node.js (v14+)

# Where to Find It

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/merajmehrabi/Outlook_Calendar_MCP)
* [npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/outlook-calendar-mcp)

If you’ve ever wondered why some coffee tastes like a rich, complex experience while others taste like burnt dirt, you’re not alone. The secret? Specialty coffee vs. commodity coffee. Let’s break it down!



So, What Is Specialty Coffee?



Specialty coffee refers to high-quality coffee beans that score 80+ points on a 100-point scale, as graded by certified professionals (yes, that’s a real job). These beans are grown in ideal climates, hand-picked for ripeness, carefully processed, and roasted to highlight their unique flavors.



In contrast, commodity coffee (your standard grocery store or diner brew) is mass-produced with a focus on quantity, not quality. These beans are often machine-harvested, mixed with defective or underripe beans, and roasted dark to cover up inconsistencies.



How Does It Taste Different?



Ever had a cup of coffee that actually tasted fruity, floral, nutty, or chocolatey without adding syrups? That’s the magic of specialty coffee! Because it’s grown, processed, and roasted with care, it retains its natural flavors—often influenced by the region where it’s grown.



Commodity coffee, on the other hand, tends to taste bitter, flat, or overly roasted because it’s designed for consistency rather than complexity.



Why Does It Cost More?



You might have noticed that specialty coffee costs more than your average supermarket can of grounds. Here’s why:



 Better farming practices – Specialty coffee is often grown using sustainable and ethical practices.

 Fairer wages for farmers – Small-scale farmers earn more because they focus on quality over quantity.

 Higher quality control – Beans are meticulously sorted, ensuring only the best make it into your cup.

 Freshness – Specialty coffee is typically roasted in small batches and meant to be consumed within weeks, not months (or years).



Is It Worth the Hype?



Absolutely—if you love coffee and want to experience it beyond just a caffeine fix. Specialty coffee isn’t just about being “fancy”—it’s about flavor, ethics, and sustainability. Whether you’re brewing at home or visiting a specialty café, trying a fresh, well-roasted single-origin coffee can completely change how you think about your morning cup.



If you’ve never tried specialty coffee before, start with a light or medium roast single-origin from a local roaster. Try brewing it with a pour-over or AeroPress to bring out its best flavors. Trust me, once you taste the difference, there’s no going back!

1j1dimz,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1j1dimz/i_have_no_idea_what_happened/,I have no idea what happened,"In 2024 my sleep gradually declined to its worst point ever. Years earlier I suffered from serious sleep anxiety but eventually came out of it, but a newfound addiction to coffee had formed. That addiction, by mid 2024 became 1-2 cups every single day, no matter what. Most days I feel like I lived in a fog, struggling to make it through work with droopy eyes and dark circles. It was truly a sick cycle that had very few decent days in between. After taking a closer look at what could be causing my sleep issues considering my anxiety really was at all time lows, I zeroed in on this sub and caffeine. 1-2 cups a day? No way I thought. Then I quit cold turkey, and everything changed.

I must have had an extreme caffeine sensitivity (was also a big iced tea drinker and chocolate eater too, mind you), because something truly amazing happened where after my week of brutal headaches and withdrawals, everything began changing. Suddenly, I was getting sleep again at night. Suddenly, I was sleeping better than I ever had in years. Suddenly, I was having DEEP dreams again almost every single night. when I kid you not I could not remember the last time I dreamt. This went on for close to a month and it felt like I was reborn. Then, as the title says, I have no idea what happened.

  
Slowly but surely I started sleeping poorly again. To be clear, I would fall asleep quicker than I ever had on caffeine instead of tossing and turning for an hour and even on nights where I didn't sleep much I still never felt as bad as I did when on caffeine, but problems were brewing. Early awakenings suddenly became the norm. 4:30am, 5am, 5:30am. You name the day, I was likely up way too early instead of what should have been 7 or 7:30am. In addition, my night time sleepyness went away and never really returned and my dreams also disappeared. This has gone on now for another 1.5 months and has left me feeling devastated and without hope. I have had no changes in my diet and have not gotten on any medication or anything of the such. I just don't understand what happened.

Maybe someone can offer some insight, but it seems as if my withdrawal from caffeine did something to my nervous system that calmed it down tremendously, and then somehow, someway, some sort of underlying anxiety returned and has stayed put since, even though, and I promise you this, I do not feel like I am anxious much at all.",1,1740873479.0,decaf,2,0.67,False

My mother, however, would occasionally tell us stories from her childhood in the Northern Cape and the many paranormal experiences she had. She would talk about how her grandfather would wake up at 3 AM and start screaming prayers. As a kid, those stories scared me, but I never thought much of them—until I got to experience it first-hand in high school.

I had the chance to live in the house where she claimed all these events happened, and it did not disappoint. In the first week alone, I heard doors slamming down the hall for two hours straight. My bunk bed would suddenly shake in the middle of the night. I’d hear tapping just outside my room’s wall at 2 AM. But the scariest experience was when we were all watching a movie, and something walked past the coffee table and slammed my mother’s bedroom door shut. At first, I didn’t notice anything, but once the door slammed, I realized I had seen something in my peripheral vision.

For some reason, rural people almost always believe in ghosts, and after those experiences, I understand why. There’s something about being in the middle of nowhere that feels terrifying, as if it invites the unknown. I’ve moved several times since then and never experienced anything like that again.

Topology, in its most basic form, is the study of space, continuity, and transformation without concern for rigid distances. It deals with what stays the same when things stretch, bend, or twist. The key is understanding structure beneath appearance—which is precisely what we need for narratival architectures.

Here are three entry-level topological concepts and how they apply to conceptual hypergraphs, mythologies, and dynamic meaning-making.

Connectedness—Ensuring Ideas Flow

In topology, connectedness asks: Is everything part of a single whole, or are there isolated fragments? A space is connected if it cannot be split into two non-overlapping pieces. A disconnected conceptual framework is one where some ideas exist but have no real pathway to others. This is conceptual fragmentation—ideas floating in isolation without synthesis.

Compactness—Managing Infinite Meaning Within Finite Bounds

In topology, a space is compact if it behaves like a finite space in crucial ways—even if it extends infinitely. Compactness helps control infinite complexity by ensuring that every possible path through the space can be covered by a finite number of key ideas. Hypergraphs tend to explode in complexity. Once you start linking ideas with hyperedges, suddenly everything connects to everything. Compactness asks: How do we keep this navigable?

Homotopy—Deforming Meaning Without Losing Identity

Homotopy is the idea that two spaces are the same if one can be continuously deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A coffee cup and a donut are homotopic because you can stretch one into the other without breaking it—both have one hole. A narratival architecture with good homotopy ensures that even as it adapts, expands, or shifts, it never breaks its internal coherence.

If the goal is to build a mythology that survives transformation, then topology is not just a metaphor—it’s the deep structure of meaning itself.",1,1740873100.0,GrimesAE,0,1.0,False

We were both at the end of divorcing abusive partners and leaving unhealthy marriages.  I have a rough background with alcoholism and have been clean for almost 10 years.  My drinking certainly helped ruin my marriage and I've since gotten help and kept a tight grip on my life by staying sober and working on myself. She has Borderline Personality disorder and as she was working through her issues with a therapist,  when her husband told her that he wasn't attracted any longer and dumped her.
 
We met as we were both separated and found we were good friends. In time, I felt like I found someone truly special. She didn't judge me for my past and we have a really good experience being sweet to each other and learning our rhythms.

For the first 3 months we would talk a lot and get coffee, and generally didn't want to ruin being friends with a ONS. After those 3 months she told me she was in love with me. For the first time in my life, I was really head over heels about someone.  Her quirks and personality made her so radiant to me, and the way we supported each other and laughed together made my heart feel so full.  Recently, I had her keys and would walk her dogs, cook for her when she was sick or tired, and we started thinking of a future for us.

This week, she made my heart jump when she told me she was thinking about getting a place together when our leases were up after this summer.  We'd have been together for almost a year when making that choice, and it felt right.

Here are some relevant details before the events of the other night:
-One of the only times I saw her Borderline issues arise was early on when I changed a song on Spotify using her phone.  She was LIVID that I touched her locked phone to change a song that was accidentally stuck on repeat. She mentioned it a few times for two weeks after it happened.

-I had an awkward rebound post-divorce that ended horribly and with me being ghosted for not being available enough.  This person would turn out to be a friend of my recent ex and it was something we talked through pretty easily.

-Her job is one where it would end her career if anything inappropriate of her were ever leaked.

-I was told to not save temporary pictures she had sent, and I never did.  I respected that boundary.

-As a ""joke"" she screenshotted one of my temporary pictures to her phone and joked about showing her friend.  I wasn't happy about it but let it go.

-If I ever asked to look through her phone, she'd laugh at me.

-I got a new phone last week and am currently moving notes/reminders/work info between the two and haven't had time to finish moving everything over and have kept the old phone around as a backup this week.

Last night we spent the evening together, I read to her and was telling her how beautiful I found her. I mentioned that I made use of replaying her temporary picture the earlier night and she took that to mean that I screenshotted one of her pictures.  She asked for my new phone, promptly opened my media, private folder, and trash.  She found NO pictures of her. I didn't like that she was looking through my files like I would betray her trust.

She then demanded to see my old phone.  The old phone had pictures of my old life, and I hadn't even been ready to open my old private folder and see or delete pictures of my ex-wife, or a couple of pictures sent to me from the unfortunate re-bound who was her friend.  I didn't want her to see that, or any of the porn I had saved while before and during my divorce.

I asked her if she'd do the same for me and she admitted she wouldn't, and that it was a double standard.  I was too ashamed that she'd see old pictures, or pics/videos I took for her but wasn't confident enough to send.

We made dinner, I helped her clean her home, I took her to the store and picked up her dogs, and then she flipped a switch and decided I had copied her pictures.  I didn't want her to see my old private folder, but kind of wish I did.  I miss her so much but felt so shocked that she responded  by throwing me out of her home.  She gave me back most of the little things I had left there and threw me out.  She called me an hour after and talked for a minute before deciding she shouldn't have called and blocked my number, and socials.

I'm devastated and not sure if I should have just let her steamroll me, or if she'll ever want to see me again.  I just hate this is how this ends.  This is how we end after falling in love and getting along in such a deep way.  Is that what we owe those we love?  

Letting them get away with behavior they would never condone? Is it really my fault the relationship is over?  I appreciate all input.

Edit 1 -> She's been in treatment for 2 years and generally does very well most days.  This is the worst flip out I have had with her. She does not currently meet a BPD diagnosis. But she did before therapy/ meds.",2,1740872989.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

1j1dbym,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1j1dbym/help_trying_to_find_specific_milk_jug/,Help trying to find specific milk jug,"I was lucky enough to go on vacation to Japan last year. In fact the coffee out there inspired me to get into proper pourovers when I got home.

  
On one of the final days, we went to a small cafe for breakfast, they type staffed and patronised by elderly Japanese locals. I’ve spent the past 30 minutes on Google street view trying and failing to find it, although I managed to salvage a photo of a portion of the front of the building, hopefully attached below. My main memory was a lot of yellow, and it was located in Asakusa, on an East-West running street/alley, north of the tourist hotspot around the temple. I still don’t really understand Japanese addressees, but looking at Google Maps I’m pretty sure it was around 3/4/5 chome in Asakusa.



Anyway, in this compact breakfast spot we had pancakes and high quality coffee for a low and friendly price. It was this very cup of coffee that made me realise that the coffee I brewed at home was crap, and I needed to up my game, and as soon as we got back I purchased a V60 and a K6 grinder.



However, back to my main point, the coffee at this small cafe was served with milk in a miniature glass beaker. I’m now wanting to buy one of these beakers as a small present for my partner. The only ones I’ve been able to find so far had measuring marks and text on them, but as seen in the photo below, this beaker was just glass with no markings.



If anyone can direct me where I can buy one of these it would be much appreciated, I’m located in the UK, so if it’s available to buy over here even better, but can easily get things shipped here.

1j1dayz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j1dayz/these_worry_dolls_are_plotting_my_demise/,These Worry Dolls Are Plotting My Demise,"I consider myself quite cultured for a white Midwesterner, even though I've never left the country, learned a language beyond Pig Latin, or tried many foreign dishes. But if you ask anyone from our side of the trailer park, they'll tell you we were a loud and loving bunch of hippies. My mom did an amazing job of introducing us to different cultures, ideas, races, and religions. The challenge was that there wasn’t much diversity in our area, so we mostly explored these ideas through books, tv, local Native American powwows, and the eclectic and eccentric crowd at Midwestern music festivals.



My mom often visited a quirky little shop called Strawberry Fields, overflowing with patchwork purses, tie-dye t-shirts, Grateful Dead tapestries, and a variety of paraphernalia labeled for “tobacco only.” Most of the time, she would go without all six of us kids, but she always returned with little gifts for each of us. My mom has a knack for finding small and unique treasures. She’s loved surprising us with them for as long as I can remember. It’s her love language. 



Once, she brought me home this little yellow box that was the size of a hotwheels car. It was in the shape of an oval, and had little red and green symbols all over it. She wouldn’t tell me what it was until I opened it. 



There was a little note folded up neatly, so I picked it up off the pile of miniature dolls. The little piece of paper explained how to use them. It read something along the lines of… “Tell all your worries to the worry dolls, place them under your pillow before bed, and when you wake up all of your worries will be gone.”



I remember picking up one of the little dolls, and my heart melted at the sight of them. They were no bigger than the tip of my index finger, and I was about seven years old at the time. They were brightly colored, and they were so different from one another. I was in awe of how unique each of them were. I made sure to let my mom know how grateful I was, and I was ecstatic to use them that night. 



I loved whispering to my little dolls before going to sleep. I didn’t do it every night, but I kept them on a shelf in my room and would pull them down when I felt it necessary. They were so small that they would easily get lost, eaten by pets, broken, etc. So my mom would replace them once every so often. 



I am now twenty-four and I honestly hadn’t thought about them since eighth grade when I decided I was too old for worry dolls. The magic of the dolls had died with the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and the Easter Bunny. Instead of using them to cope with my negative thoughts, I decided it was time to use a diary in their place. 



It wasn’t until I was at one of the local flea markets that I spotted a blue storage tub amongst all the faded baseball cards, random tools, and three decade old Christmas decorations. It had a piece of printer paper duct taped to the front of it that read “$0.50 bin” written with a magnum sharpie.



My curiosity got the best of me, and I made my way over to the bin and crouched down to get a better look. Faded toys, a few crocheted oven mitts, a set of ugly clip-on earrings, and three packages of unopened worry dolls. I felt the nostalgia flood through me and a smile spread across my face. I grabbed all three from the box and paid the vendor $1.50 for the bunch. 



I didn’t need three boxes of worry dolls of course, but I thought it would be a fun surprise for my mom and little sister. We have family dinners most Tuesday nights, so I kept them in my glove box until the next get together. 



They were both happy to see the little dolls again. They didn’t even need to open the box to know what they were, but they did anyway because we loved seeing each unique doll. They opened them up and neatly laid them side by side in a row on the kitchen table. 



There was one with a striped skirt and a purple shirt , another with a blue dress and a yellow poncho, and a few little guys with pants and t-shirts. They all had the same black hair that was made out of sand and black paint, but all uniquely designed. They thanked me for the gifts and we all promised to try them out that night to see if they really worked.



I went home that night and opened my package that had been sitting in the car for two days at this point. I placed the yellow box on the side table next to the bed and stared at it with a sentimental smile as I thought about what I might tell the dolls about. 



I carefully took the lid off, grabbing both sides with my thumb and index finger. I dumped the contents of the box out on the night stand and quickly noticed that something was off. I flinched because I thought whatever was inside was some kind of creature.



I know that sounds crazy, but the meaty sounding thud it made when it hit the wood was disturbing. I just stared at the thing for about thirty seconds to make sure it wasn’t going to move. Slowly, I sat back up and nudged it so that its “face” was upward. This didn’t help my growing anxiety by any means. 



Yea, it resembled a worry doll, but it was thick, dark, and sickly looking. The usual sand and paint that was used for the hair was replaced by a little tuft of what looked like real hair from a human or an animal. Its little outfit was not colorful, but a black cloak that covered its whole body and was made of some woven fabric similar to what is normally used for these kinds of dolls. 



The most disturbing thing was the face. Rather than having eyes and a mouth painted with black ink, it appeared as if someone had hollowed out the features from a piece of ham. The color resembled pale skin, with thin, vein-like patterns running across it. My brow furrowed in confusion and disgust. Why did mine look like that? Both my mom and my sister had completely normal dolls. 



Instead of touching it, I decided to take a picture to send to my sister. I wanted to get her thoughts, and maybe even joke about how creepy it was. I pulled my phone out and opened up the camera. I leaned over the doll and snapped a few pics before switching over to our messages. When I pulled up the photo tab, the pictures I had just taken weren’t there. It was like I had never taken them. 



I backed out to make sure they weren’t in my camera roll and possibly not loading, but they weren’t there either. Not even in my recently deleted. I tried again to take the picture, but this time I did it in the message app. The picture took, but it was really bright, like someone was shining an industrial flashlight at the thing. I still tried to send the picture, but it just kept giving me an error message. 



I gave up, believing my phone needed an update or something, but I was too lazy to check and was honestly more interested in the thing sitting in front of me. I finally decided that it was harmless because it hadn’t moved or anything. It just creeped me out in my quiet house. 



I slowly reached out to grab the doll while unconsciously holding my breath. I brought the doll closer to my face and examined it closer. I remember saying “You’re a creepy little thing,” with a grimace on my face. It was such an odd thing. And I wondered why only my box had one doll that was bigger than normal. 



I thought maybe it was some kind of special edition thing, but realized that would be really weird considering they weren’t necessarily a hot commodity. Who would seek out a special edition worry doll?



I decided it was best to stop asking questions and just try to use the thing, like I had promised my mom and sister. I thought maybe the doll would grow on me eventually, considering I have a soft spot for horror movies and creepy props. 



I set the doll down for a moment to get comfortable under the covers before holding it up in front of me. I thought for a moment and decided I’d just share one worry. It was only one doll after all, and generally you tell one worry to one doll. That’s why they tend to come in groups or pairs. 



I spoke the words out loud, “I just want a fulfilling job.”



I had recently gotten a job as a dental assistant with a well known dental corporation. They paid well over the normal wage for assistants in my area, but the dentist was a terror. I assume they needed to put someone in golden handcuffs so they could keep their turnover rates under control. Doctor Selepka. He was a large and imposing man who was horrible to his patients and his staff. He would grab us by the arm forcefully if we weren’t looking in the mouth at the “right angle”. He would forcefully shove patients' heads back on the chair before doing any exam. Other times he would get in screaming matches with other male patients who wouldn’t put up with his shit.



All that being said, it had only been two months, but I was losing my mind with this disgusting excuse for a man. I came home in tears on a daily basis for a plethora of reasons. This doll thing was worth a shot at least. Even if to just say the words out loud. Speaking your intentions as they say. 



I tucked the oddly textured doll under my pillow and snuggled into bed. It didn’t take long for me to fall into a deep sleep. 



I slept like a rock. It was one of those sleeps that makes you feel like you time traveled to the next day. I woke up in the same position that I fell asleep in, which made my body so sore. 



I rolled out of bed, groaning and rubbing my stiff muscles. I had honestly had enough of this job, and just whispering to the little doll about my worries, kinda made me realize how badly things had gotten. I wasn’t going to quit right now, because I needed the money, but I figured it would be fine to call in for just one day. It was a Friday, so I decided to give myself a three day weekend. My mental health needed a break.



I sent a half hearted excuse about not feeling well and  got a half hearted “feel better” from my manager. I started my morning like any other weekend. Freshen up, Coffee, comfy clothes, Youtube. 



I plopped down on the couch and turned on my favorite podcast before deciding I should call my sister to fill her in on everything. I held down the power button to activate Siri and said, “Call Sissy’s facetime,” I waited for a moment before she answered. The sound of screeching children in the background filled my living room. “Hunter! Stop hitting your brother!” she shouted before turning her attention to me. 



“Sorry, what’s up?” She said with an exhausted smile. 



“Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to tell you about what happened last night. You know those worry dolls I got us?” 



“Yea,”



“Well mine looks super weird,” I said with a nervous giggle. 



“What do you mean?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. 



“There was only one doll and it's really weird looking. It’s bigger than normal and feels fleshy. It looks like something from a horror prop store,” 



“Lemme see,” she said, looking more disturbed than before. 



“I tried sending pics last night but they wouldn’t load, or take. I’ll see if I can get it to work,” I flipped my camera to face the floor as I got off the couch and walked to my bedroom. I grabbed the corner of my pillow and flipped it up for dramatic effect, but paused. The doll was gone. 



My sister didn’t say anything for a second, most likely confused. “Bro I swear to god I put it under my pillow before bed.” 



“Check under your bed or maybe you kicked it under the sheets somehow.” 



I tore my bed apart looking for the silly thing, but there was nothing. “Hey, lemme call you back,” I said before hanging up abruptly. I turned over to my side table and grabbed the little yellow box. It had weight again. “Maybe I put it in here and didn’t remember,” I thought to myself. I took the lid off and was astonished to see a completely new doll sitting inside.



She was dressed in a similar black cloth, but wore a little black flower crown on her head. There was a miniature skull placed right in the center of the crown. Her hair also appeared to be from a living thing, not sure what, but her bangs were much more well kept than the last doll. A straight across cut, each black hair in its place. The thing that really creeped me out was her face. She had the same hollowed out eyes, but her expression wasn’t blank. She was frowning and crying… tears of blood. 



I instinctively lifted my index finger to touch the blood. It was wet. Fresh red blood dripping from her right eye and pooling in the other. I whimpered and set it back down. “What the fuck?” I whispered to myself. 



I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some sort of prank, the only problem with that is, I don’t don’t have many friends outside of my immediate family. My mom has never been into pranks, in fact, she got pretty upset the few times we ever pulled any on her as kids. My sister was busy raising two kids and lived at least forty five minutes away. My other siblings didn’t reach out much, so I was stumped. 



I decided that this must be something supernatural. And I know, most people would look for any other explanation, but like I said before, I was raised around some of the most eccentric people you could imagine. I am a believer in the paranormal at the very least. 



I paced from the living room to the bedroom, periodically checking to see if it moved at all. It stayed put as my mind raced.



 A few moments into my panicked pacing, my phone rang. The caller ID read “Addie,” my boss's name. I rolled my eyes, realizing she was probably going to beg me to come in or something stupid. I answered anyway because I’m a pushover.



“Hey,” I said, trying to mimic a tired, sick person.

 

“Hey girl,” the sounds of smacking gum violated my ears, “something crazy just happened.” My brow furrowed in confusion although I knew she couldn’t see it. 



“What?” 



“Dr. Salepka died this morning,” she stated bluntly, as if she was telling me what she ate for lunch. 



“What? What-How?” I sputtered in shock.



“Jane found him in his pool. Apparently it was pretty bad. His guts were everywhere like an animal attack or something,”



Jane was the dental hygienist that the doctor had been hooking up with in “private” but it was no secret. They rode to work together every morning and went out for drinks nearly every night. 



“Oh my god… that’s insane Addie. Is Jane okay?” I asked, very concerned about her mental state after seeing something so gruesome. 



“She was pretty freaked out when she called me, but she said she’s still coming in on Monday,” I scoffed at her disregard for the situation. 



“Okay Addie, I’m still not feeling well so I’m gonna go rest up so I can be there Monday too,” I retorted passive aggressively knowing she wouldn’t even catch it. I hung up before she could respond and sat down on the couch with my head in my hands. 



Images of Dr. Salepka’s dead body kept flashing in my mind. I hadn’t seen it of course, but my mind painted me a pretty vivid picture regardless of if I wanted to see it. I hated the man with a burning passion, but this was insane. My mind couldn’t help but wonder if the doll had played a part in this or if it was just some crazy coincidence. I decided it was the latter. 



Before I went to sleep that night, I decided to put the lid back on the box. I placed it on the top of my bookshelf. Out of sight, out of mind. 



That night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had ever experienced in my life. They all related to yesterday's events, but it was in such a positive light. I dreamt about what work might be like without him around. I imagined how much anger and negativity had left the world with just one person. It made me feel… happy.The whole time it felt like I had taken ecstasy. It was an intoxicating feeling that I was honestly sad to wake up from. 



When I woke up that morning, I felt so refreshed. Like someone had washed my brain with sunshine and cool water. I smiled as I did my weekend, morning routine and found myself humming and bouncing around the house. 



When I turned the TV on to youtube, I saw one of my favorite True Crime channels had posted a video. Something about the title made me remember what had happened the day before. My heart sank for half a second, but it dissipated quickly. It’s like my brain knew it didn’t want to feel sorry. A part of me felt like it was my fault, and I was somehow proud of it. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it now. 



As of now, I will keep the doll on the shelf until I get some suggestions as to what I should do.  Does anyone have experience with these specific types of dolls? I’ll link some drawings I made of the dolls so you can get an idea of what they look like. Any advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance. Until next time.

I'm having trouble getting **Org-Mode (9.8-pre) and Org-Roam** to load correctly on **Emacs-Mac**. I primarily need **Org-Latex-Preview** and **Org-Roam** for my physics studies, but neither of them seems to work properly. I have to say I am fairly new to emacs, so I am pretty sure it's probably just a stupid mistake on my part. Would buy you a coffee/pp for help <3

# System Details:

* **Emacs distribution:** Emacs-Mac (installed via https://emacsformacosx.com/)
* **Pre-installed Org-Mode:** Emacs-Mac ships with **Org 9.7.11** at `/Applications/Emacs.app/...`
* **Custom Org installation:** I installed Org-Mode **9.8-pre** from source and placed it in `~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-mode/`
* **Org-Roam version:** Latest version from MELPA

# Problem:

1. **Org-Mode (9.8-pre) does not load properly**
2. **Org-Roam does not initialize**
3. **Org-Latex-Preview is not working (even with correct settings)**

# What I've Tried So Far:

* **Ensured that Org loads from** `~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-mode/` instead of the system-wide version(use-package org :load-path ""\~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-mode/lisp/"")
* **Completely reinstalled Emacs multiple times**
* **Followed this Org-Latex-Preview installation guide:** [https://abode.karthinks.com/org-latex-preview/](https://abode.karthinks.com/org-latex-preview/)
* used `:demand t` but then some features won't work
* **Ran** `make` **to build Org manually** (fixed some issues, but still doesn’t load correctly)
* **Checked** `load-path` **to confirm that Emacs is picking up the correct Org version**                    `M-x org-version -> Org mode verson 9.8pre @/Users/name/.emacs.d/elpa/org-mode/lisp/`

          the days short, sky dark
          with a quiet eery silence 
          of snow covered ground, 
          dangerous but so lovely.
          Driving home the tires
         rasped softly in the snow.

         Once home we enjoyed the 
         deep white snow abounding
         as it lightened the dark sky
         as if God’s light blessed us 
         in peace and soft simplicity. 
         ©️LGE May 16, 2024




                       



          evening.Many in the military who came to Alaska,
          just as us didn’t see Alaska as a good place to live.

	They did not see the short days and the long winter
	night’s darkness as of peace and simplicity nor did
         they see the endless light of summer as fascinating, 
         beautiful and wonderful as did my husband and I.

         When others first came to Alaska in early summer
         they didn’t stay up the first few nights fascinated
         with the light upon them until the early morning
         hour. They hid the beautiful and intriguing light. 
    
	We on the other hand adjusted to the uniqueness.
         Not even my husband complained. Perhaps it was 
         because he loved me and gave up sleep for me? 
         Perhaps I wasn’t paying attention just loving the sun?

        But I know that both of us loved Alaska and wanted to 
        stay longer and that does not sound like a man who
        disliked the light in the early morning hours. We loved
        every season of Alaska and would have stayed longer.

	There were other things that fascinated me as I 
	went about my winter days. The first was the 
	Northern lights, the technical term, Aurora borealis; 
         Supercharged solar particles colliding with the earth.

	 Technically colliding with the earthen atmosphere 
           in colours of green, white, purple, blue, red, white.
           I know that happens in  other places besides Alaska
           But I was happy with such stupendous splendor. 

          Then we tried the coffee experiment where on a cold 
          winter night we threw coffee up towards the sky and 
          watched icicles falling back down. That was such fun.
	 That though happens many places where it is cold.
          
          Our first Christmas was lovely that year. We loved
          to see the Christmas lights reflected on the snow
          but we also loved the wonderful Christmas story
          of the birth of God’s son in that cold winter’s night.

So on 2/24/25 had my annual physical and I was down to a 2xlt again. But since can’t be weight that easily. I weighted in at 380 at my appointment. One think I have noticed that after a 5 weeks I noticed I can’t eat as much as I could before. I could eat a high protein meal every 2-4 hours so 2-3 meals and had to add carbs to avoid low sugars. But one thing I kept on doing was zero sugar sodas that were zero calories too. I use a dexcom g7 and never noticed any spikes of sugar at all. But days I tested just water and started to stay at a higher 130-180 glucose reading threw out the days. Been only using insulin before I break my fast with a large coffee. With a treat granola or toasted bread or quesadilla. I am getting constant blood tests to keep an eye on me while I am fasting. Also my ac1 is 6.7-7 these last few tests. But I am a huge insulin user since a cracker will make my numbers skyrocket. Yeah a cracker will make me go over 350 it might be related to my celiac. Yeah I have to be gluten free but can’t afford that so I will take the insulin spikes and pain to be feed. Anyone else with similar fasting habits. Also I am know to do up to 22/2 fasting depending on how I feel. I eat from 4pm till midnight. Sometimes I cut it short till 10pm but main concern is the sugar level to have enough carbs to keep my sugar above 100 don’t want to risk any lows that will make me break my fast with a glucose gel pack. Now that we have my weight we will see in a few months how much I lost. The longer I keep this up the easier it gets plus I will be stricter to get those results we see people post often. ,35,1740871994.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.97,False

His team virtually excised all endo from my body, allowing me to live the most painfree daily life I've ever had. My periods used to make me break out in cold sweats and pass out. I was told it was normal. (Obviously lol, not.) I've never wanted kids. Pregnancy horrifies me. After the election, I knew it was time to finally have my tubes removed -- even if I was carrying my old endo trauma with me.

To prep for this surgery (consultation was November 19) I made sure I worked out and walked. A lot. I love exercising, so I was strength training 5-6x a week (heavy core & arm emphasis as I know getting out of bed sucks when you can't use your core) as well as walking 5-6 miles a day. I feel like this really helped move my recovery along, as you'll read!

My bisalp was scheduled for February 26. The only time I got a comment about this decision was the anesthesiologist's assistant. (He asked how many kids I already have as they were getting ready to wheel me to the OR, and I said none. He blurted, ""Why are you even doing this then?"" before adding, ""Actually, you're so much better off for it."" and that was that.) One of the OR nurses held my hand while I went under, which was one of the nicest things a stranger ever did for me. 

I woke up, inquiring immediately about my tubes. One was removed (yay!) but the scar tissue from my endo surgeries made it very difficult to get my left tube out. My surgeon, knowing my goal was sterilization, cut it up into pieces and cauterized the tube -- virtually rendering it 99.99% useless. Best part? I was dry. Zero new endometrioma growths. No bursts cysts. I was officially 6+ years endo-free and counting.

**First Day:** Showed up at the hospital at 830, OP at 10 (10:15 technically), left hospital by 1PM. I was so jazzed  that I had a successful surgery that I was awake the whole day. I was also excited to finally eat real food since I was on a liquid diet on Tuesday. I was in really happy spirits with maybe 3/10 pain.

**Second Day:** Probably my toughest day. Sleep was rough, as I hate sleeping on my back. Pain was still 3/10, but walking with a support pillow helped a bunch. Gas pains actually went to my shoulders/back or perhaps it was because I hate sitting 'normally' (I can't help but sit cross-legged or in weird positions) so I was stiff. I napped more this day as I was exhausted from the operation, but I happily had my first hot meal. First shower was heaven. Went to bed early and got 10 hours of sleep.

**Third Day:** 1/10 pain. Spent the day extremely giddy every time I remembered they were out, while spending lots of time cuddling my dog and catching up on some youtube channels I follow. Lots of walking and standing. Incision sites are getting itchy but manageable.

**Fourth Day (Today!):** 0/10 pain. First night I got to fully sleep on my side with some support with a pillow wall. It was beautiful outside so I took a walk with my mom up and down our block. Getting up and down out of bed/chairs is a breeze. First coffee in over a week and a half. The sun is shining. I think it's the first time I've felt two consecutive days without anxiety, something I'm plagued with.

I still have my post-op appointment on the 12th, but I've never felt so normal after a surgery so quickly. I know there is plenty of recovery ahead of me, normal life will still take time, but it feels like I own my body. Like the anxiety I've carried since I was a teenager about pregnancy and being trapped for life is just... gone. It doesn't exist anymore. I'm free.

This then makes me feel like I’m not “woman enough” to call myself a woman.

1j1cv51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j1cv51/aita_for_telling_a_family_member_off_for/,AITA for telling a family member off for purposely triggering my OCD?,"

Hello I am 23F and I had a disagreement with a family member 60M over an incident. I am living with them and overall we have a very good and supportive relationship, but something that happened today really upset me. I was diagnosed with OCD as a child and have been in therapy/on medication for it since. It’s something I’ve spent a lot of time working on and I’m very proud of the progress I have made. 



My OCD is about contamination/germs. My FM has known about my diagnosis since I got it and I have spent a lot of time talking to him about it. I even bought a book about living with someone with OCD as I know it can be difficult. He has been a huge supporter of my recovery even though he doesn’t fully understand it. 



However, today as I was making coffee I saw that he came out of the bathroom without washing his hands. I playfully gave him a hard time and encouraged him to wash his hands. He did and we both joked about it and it felt like it ended fine. 



Later, when I was making lunch he came out of the bathroom again without washing his hands. I could hear him approaching me and I asked if he washed his hands. He laughed and said no before wiping his hands on the sides of my sweatshirt and pants. I was so shocked I ran out of the room to go change. 



After, I came back down and said that I thought it was a mean thing to do and that it was very upsetting and that not washing your hands after using the restroom is inconsiderate as well as an immature habit to have at his age. He begrudgingly apologized, but acted like I was lecturing him for no reason. To be clear, I never raised my voice- I was definitely a bit stern but I felt it was necessary. 



While I don’t expect him to keep track of all my triggers I feel like that is something that would upset anyone- OCD or no OCD. Especially within hours of our first conversation about the importance of washing hands after using the restroom. 



AITA for lecturing him about doing something he knew would be upsetting?

I'm a ""regular"", my go-to drink is a vanilla soy latte. Especially lately, many times I get a drink and it's SOUR, makes me feel sick after two sips. I have to ask them to remake it and feel annoying. Most times, I'm late to work and don't even have time to do that. But like it's sooo often lately, doesn't matter what location, idgi. Sometimes the soy just won't mix, sometimes it's in little chunks- like this pic from today, I shook it and the soy just settled to the bottom in chunks. My friend who was a barista said it's rotten. Then I get it remade at a different location bc I'm afraid the other one has bad soy and I can tell they don't love doing that and I get it but the shit costed me almost $10! 

I have never worked in the food/beverage industry. Is there some shortage? Does the vendor not replenish your products enough? Just bc I can an imagine a corporation screwing their employees like that
I'm a very friendly person, I just wanna know what the deal is, I dont think it's the barista's fault. I feel annoying having to go back for a new one, being a barista looks hectic I know you guys are doing your best. Any way to break this cycle? Am I supposed to ask them the check the milk first? I'd feel like a Karen... I just want a coffee that doesn't make me siiiick 😭

1j1ctyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j1ctyu/he_25m_ghosted_me_21f_after_taking_my_virginity/,He (25M) ghosted me (21F) after taking my virginity and dating for 4 months.,"For context He has a very busy job, and I’m still in university, so he was always a bit bad at replying. However, we would usually text long messages at least once a day or every other day, just keeping each other updated. I once jokingly told him that when he doesn’t message me, I feel like he’s ghosting me. He reassured me, saying, “I would never ghost you.” I was hesitant about getting into this because of our age difference and being in different stages of life, but he always reassured me about that as well. He said he didn’t mind paying for dates as I was only a student, and he even talked about meeting my friends and whether he’d get along with them. He told me that he was so nervous around me as I was so pretty and that he’s told his friends about how good our dates are.

The week before Valentine’s Day was really hectic for him at work, so I told him it was fine if he wasn’t great at replying. Still, he messaged me on Valentine’s Day, sending a picture of himself working late and apologising for not being able to see me. Since he was working the weekend, one of my girlfriends invited me out, and I agreed since I didn’t have any plans. While I was out, he messaged me, but I was already enjoying the night, so I reposted my friend’s story and shared a picture of myself on Instagram. Since he often viewed my stories without replying, I didn’t think it was a big deal in our dynamic

My friend is a model, so we ended up at a well-known DJ’s set, and one of our friends, a bartender there, gave us free drinks all night. I got home late and was extremely hungover the next morning. Since I had class, I didn’t text him until 3 PM after I was done, just updating him about my night and asking about his weekend. The DJ ended up following me on instagram and I followed him back as he had a really good set, and he knew my friend anyway; I'm not sure if he noticed this or cared.

He didn’t reply the next day, so I double-texted to check if everything was okay. He finally responded the following day with a long paragraph, saying he was just really bad at this and that he “knows he needs to be better.” I replied that same day—my message was a bit neutral and slightly passive-aggressive, but I still wished him a good week off since he had time off. Now, it’s been nine days, the longest he’s ever gone without replying. I recently posted a photo from a hike on my Instagram story, and he viewed it but still didn’t respond. I know he’s a bit insecure, but I haven’t talked to or kissed any other guys since our first date. We also established we were sleeping with each other exclusively.

When I was on my phone in front of him once, he commented on how many unread messages I had. One time I got his plans mixed up and he jokingly got mad and said must’ve been your other man, and I reassured him there are no other guys. One time I described to him the outfit I was wearing for my friends birthday and he asked me “is that your fuck me outfit?”. Another time, I told him about getting a free pastry at a coffee shop while reading my book, and he looked visibly upset. When I asked if he was okay, he deflected, but I could tell he didn’t like it—so I stopped mentioning things like that.

I just don’t know if I did something wrong or if he simply lost interest. I know guys are weird about virginity so I didn’t even tell him I was a virgin till right before we were about to have sex, and we were still seeing each other for a month or two after that. I don’t want to double-text him again and seem annoying, but I also want answers even a simple “I’m no longer interested” message would have been better than this, which i gave the perfect opportunity for instead he promised to do better and then ghosted me. I just want some advice on what to do, should i confront him or move on? He’s in a position of authority at my placement so I will see him again, so even if he doesn’t message me again I will see him again for my next rotation.

This started 4 nights ago, but didn't post right away. 

I come in Wednesday night and my coworker has information to pass on to me.  One of the guests has been coming in and out of the lobby to try and chat her up.  She's not interested, but doesn't do an effective job shaking him off.  That's fine.  I can go into dad mode if have to, even though I don't have kids.  Because of how bus schedules work, I'm usually there early and I hang out in the back office playing on my Switch.

He comes by a few more times, and keeps trying to chat her up.  Coworker doesn't engage much in conversation.  This continues until she leaves.  The guest asks me how old my coworker is.  I go into dad mode and tell him that I do not give out personal details about coworkers.  He accepts that and fucks off to his room.  If that's all that happened, it wouldn't really be worthy of a story.

While I'm checking in another reservation, he's back down in the lobby yelling at someone or something outside the entrance door.  Something about a stolen cellphone.  This is bothering the guests at the desk, so I approach him and tell him he needs to be quiet and I will be right with him.  But instead of backing off, he goes up next to the counter while the guests checking in are processing their card.  Again I tell him to back off, but he refuses, and gets louder.  I hurry up and get the guests checked in.

Once it's just me and the guy alone in the lobby, I tell him very forcefully that he needs to go back to his room or I will have him evicted.  If he refuses, I will call the police.  He refuses, so I follow through on my threat.  He then asks me when my coworker will be back.  I tell him I will not be telling him her schedule.

Once he hears that I'm on the phone with dispatch, he goes ballistic!  He knocks down a few displays we have on the counter and makes a small mess.  Dispatch hears this and they take down the guy's information.  He goes back up to his room before the cops arrive.  Things have quieted down so by the time the cops get here, there's not much I really need them to do.  They take down my information real quick and leave.  Guy stays in his room for the rest of the night.  But that's still not the end

The next night I'm on my way again to work.  I get off the bus at the corner near my hotel.  Across the street that I need to cross is a guy shouting all kinds of obscenities including the one that starts with N (he's white).  He looks in my direction and recognizes me.  He starts threatening me that he knows where I work, that he's gonna kick my ass, etc.  I ignore him and don't react.  I just mind my own business and keep going, quickening my pace.

I arrive at the hotel, and my coworker updates me on the guy.  Management saw the notes I left about the guy and DNR'd him.  But that didn't stop him from returning later in the evening to try and chat up my coworker again.  He was at the hotel just before I got there.  Which explains why I saw him on my way into work.

Bonus DLC:

As I'm telling my coworker the details of what happened with this guy after she went home Wednesday night, another regular non-guest comes in and grabs some coffee.  She overhears me telling the story, and tells me that if I wasn't so rude to people, I wouldn't be receiving threats like that.  I told her that she's already been asked to leave and to please do so.  In the past, she and her loser boyfriend have waltzed on in to steal coffee  and make a huge mess in the process.  On another occasion, the loser boyfriend was knocking on a guest's room.  He had called to the desk to inform me of the problem.  When I went up, it was the loser boyfriend.  So needless to say, I'm not happy to see her here.  Coworker backs me up and tells me that she doesn't belong at the hotel, and that she's stealing our coffee.

""How am I stealing this?  It's complementary.""

Yes, but only for guests.  Since you're not a guest, it's not available to you.  She argues a little more before coworker threatens to call the police.  Coworker as very nice and polite, but you do anything to cross her, she can be downright mean.",30,1740871415.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,5,0.98,False

My palate is still a work in progress, and I find that eating/drinking a lot of different things outside of coffee helps develop that, as those new experiences turn into new associations you can use in coffee tasting. 

However, there is one tasting note that I dread reading on a package, and that is Lemongrass. For some reason, without fail, any single time a coffee has had lemongrass as a tasting note, it's pretty much all I can taste. 

It's so incredibly overpowering. I'm not sure if my mind is playing tricks on me, or if the roasters I gravitate to just happen to have a lot of offerings that have it as a tasting note, but it also seems that it's more prevalent than it used to be. It seems like it's not exclusive to variety or process, as I've had washed gesha's as well as co-fermented/macerated caturra's and bourbons express it thoroughly. 

 To a lesser extent I also have the same with lavender, although that one often overlaps with blueberry/black currant, and those kind of fight over being the star. Lemongrass just grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. 

I'm curious if other people have the same experience as me, or if you have you own tasting note that you just can't seem to enjoy no matter what.",1,1740871057.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

So, after spending a long time analyzing 3,618 Reddit posts and comments, I put together a summary of the biggest problems people face at each stage of life.

This whole process made me realize how quickly we get caught up in life’s struggles and forget to actually live. We’re constantly stressed about something instead of just enjoying the moment. Another thing I realized is that no matter what problem I’m dealing with, there’s a huge chance that someone else has been through it too. That thought weirdly made me feel a little better.

Hope you enjoy reading :)

# 20s

**Financial and career Struggles**

A lot of people at this age are still living with their parents, not necessarily because they want to, but because rent is ridiculous. Even if you land a decent paying job, which can feel like winning the lottery, it’s not always enough to cover rent, student loans, and other expenses.

A lot of people in their 20s feel stuck in survival mode, like they’re running to stay in place. It’s frustrating because this is supposed to be the time when you explore, take risks, and enjoy life a little.

**Figuring out Life**

A lot of people feel this weird pressure to have their identity figured out, who they are, what they want, what their values, all while social media constantly reminds you that everyone else seems to have it together.

Everyone keeps asking, “So, what’s your plan?”

The pressure to have everything figured out by a certain age is exhausting. You’re supposed to be building a career, maintaining a social life, staying fit, and maybe even dating, all while dealing with the anxiety of not knowing if you’re making the right choices.

**Am I even an adult?**

Then there’s the whole “Am I even an adult?” feeling. You’re paying bills, maybe working a full-time job, but deep down, you still feel like a kid who somehow got thrown into this world of taxes and responsibilities.

**Relationships**

Some people are settling down, some are casually dating, and some are out trying to figure out how to meet people without it being awkward.

**Friendships**

Making friends in your 20s is as hard as dating. Friendships start shifting because people are busy with work, moving away, or in different life stages. It’s not like school where you see your friends every day, now you actually have to plan to keep in touch. A lot of people start feeling lonely because making new friends as an adult isn’t as easy as it used to be.

**Family and Independence Struggles**

There’s often pressure from family, whether it’s about your career, relationships, or how you’re supposed to be living. Some parents still treat their adult kids like teenagers. It’s a weird in-between stage where you’re technically an adult but not always treated like one.

# 30s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Whether it’s student loans, credit cards, or a mortgage, it feels like there’s always something eating up your paycheck before you even get to enjoy it.

Then there’s the job situation. Some people are thriving, and others are trying to survive the 9-to-5 grind without losing their minds. The idea of switching careers sounds amazing but also terrifying. do I really wanna start from scratch again?

Basically, your 30s are about you juggling money, career moves, and existential crises while trying to sneak in some fun when you can.

**Struggles with Identity**

Your 30s are basically the season finale of your 20s, and suddenly, you’re questioning everything. Am I where I’m supposed to be? Did I waste too much time? Is it too late to switch things up?

Regret over past decisions is real. Maybe you wish you had traveled more, taken a different career path, or not been so scared to take risks in your 20s and the fear of being “too old” to start over.

**Health Concerns**

Hitting your 30s is when you start realizing you’re not invincible anymore. Suddenly, you wake up with random aches. It’s that weird stage where you’re still young, but your body is starting to remind you that you need to take better care of it.

**Friendships**

Everyone’s busy with careers, relationships, kids, whatever, so you don’t randomly hang out like you did in your 20s. If you don’t actively schedule time to see people, friendships can start to fade. And if you’re single while most of your friends are getting married or having kids, it can feel lonely, like you’re being left behind while everyone else moves on.

**Relationships**

People know what they want more, so there’s less playing of games. But on the other hand, dating apps can be exhausting, and there’s this weird pressure to hurry up and find someone before it’s too late.

**Burn Out**

A lot of people hit a point where they’re burnt out. You wake up, do the same routine, and wonder, Is this it?

**Hitting milestones**

A lot of people in their 30s talk about feeling like they haven’t hit those traditional “adult” milestones, marriage, kids, homeownership, a clear sense of direction, and it makes them wonder if they’re behind or playing by a different set of rules.

**getting old**

One day, you’re living your life, and then suddenly, things start changing. You see college kids and realize they were born in the 2000s, you catch yourself groaning when you stand up, and you actually start caring about things like fiber intake and a good night’s sleep. It’s not even that you’re old, but you definitely don’t feel as young and carefree as before.

# 40s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Some are doing well, stacking up savings and growing their income, but many others feel behind, still paying off debt, worrying about retirement, or wondering if they’ll ever own a home.

If you’re doing well, you’re probably stressing about keeping it that way. If you’re struggling, it’s more like, “Okay, so do I ever get to retire, or am I working until I drop?”

**Health Concerns**

For a lot of people, physical health starts demanding attention in ways it never did before. Suddenly, that random back pain isn’t going away, your knees sound like bubble wrap, and somehow, ear hair becomes a thing.

Now you’ve got routine screenings to schedule, cholesterol levels to monitor, and friends casually dropping the phrase, “I have to get a colonoscopy next week.”

**Friendships**

Social circles shrink, not because you don’t want friends, but because who has the time? You text back and forth with someone for months trying to plan a coffee meet-up, and by the time you actually get together, you’re both exhausted.

The loneliness can sneak up on you, too. You’re constantly surrounded by people, kids, coworkers, family, but deep down, you might feel like no one really sees you.

**Relationships**

Some people are happily settled, but a lot of couples hit rough patches, realizing they’re more like co-managers of a household than actual partners. Divorce happens, and for those newly single in their 40s, dating can feel like a completely different game. Some people have never been married and are wondering if it’s too late to find love

**Parents and Kids**

If you have young kids, you’re probably running on caffeine and whatever sleep you can grab. Finding even five minutes of personal time feels like a luxury. And for some, it’s not just raising kids, it’s also managing aging parents.

**Questioning life decisions**

A lot of people hit their 40s and start questioning everything. Did I pick the right career? Am I where I thought I’d be by now? Is it too late to switch things up? “Wait, is this it?” And then there’s the looming realization that time is moving fast, which can trigger anxiety about aging, regrets, and the whole “What’s my purpose?” spiral.

**getting old**

you start catching yourself saying, “Back in my day…” Like, you don’t even mean to, but it slips out.

Then there’s the unsolicited life advice. You see a younger person stressing about something in life and you go ahead and start giving advices like there is no tomorrow. You know you used to roll your eyes when older people did this to you. You used to think, “Okay, Grandpa, relax.” But now you are that person.

Starting to understand life

You start realizing what really matters. The friendships you do have become deeper. You start caring less about what people think and more about what makes you happy. And despite all the chaos, you get these moments, watching your kids grow, laughing with an old friend, seeing your parents smile.

# 50s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Some people are coasting toward retirement with a solid plan, while others are looking at their bank accounts thinking, Wait, I was supposed to save how much?

You start realizing ageism is very real. Suddenly, you’re removing graduation years from your résumé and praying that hiring managers don’t do the math when they see your experience.

You’d think experience would count for something, but nope, many companies seem more interested in hiring younger workers.

Health Concerns

Spinal issues, joint pain, weight gain that refuses to budge, and for some, even hair loss. One day, you’re fine, and the next, you need reading glasses to read a restaurant menu.

**Trying to Keep up**

Technology moves fast, and for a lot of older adults, keeping up can feel like a full-time job. It’s not about learning new apps, it’s about constantly adapting to updates, security changes, and entirely new systems. One day, you finally figure out how to use a smartphone, and the next, everything moves to AI and the metaverse.

In the workplace, this can be a huge issue. If you’re in your 50s or 60s and job hunting, employers might expect you to know software that wasn’t even a thing when you started your career. And if you don’t? Well, good luck getting hired.

**Getting old**

Society loves to remind people that they’re “getting older,” whether it’s by showing you targeted ads for anti-aging cream or watching younger coworkers speak an entirely different language.

the world starts treating them differently. They might be overlooked in the job market, assumed to be “out of touch,” or not taken as seriously.

You start noticing that movies and shows don’t center people your age anymore unless they’re playing the wise mentor.

**Dating**

If you’re single at 50, whether by choice, divorce, or life happening, the dating scene can feel… weird. But on the flip side, dating at this age can also be freeing, you know what you want, you’re not playing games, and you’re definitely not wasting time on people who don’t bring you peace.

**Relationships**

A 10- or 20-year gap might not matter much in your 30s and 40s, but once one partner hits their 60s or 70s, the differences become more obvious. One person might still want to travel and be active, while the other is slowing down. Then, there’s the reality of caregiving. If you’re the younger partner, you might find yourself taking care of an aging spouse way earlier than expected. That can be tough, both emotionally and physically.

**empty nest**

For parents, there’s the whole empty nest transition. One day, your house is filled with noise, chaos, and grocery bills that make no sense, and the next, you’re standing in a too-quiet kitchen wondering if you should text your kid or if that makes you clingy.

**Starting to understand life**

By 50, you’ve probably got a solid sense of who you are, you care way less about what people think, and if you’re lucky, you might finally have the wisdom and the financial means to do things you actually enjoy.

The awareness of time becomes very real. You start thinking less about climbing ladders and more about making memories. It’s not so much about having time as it is about using it well. That’s why a lot of people in their 50s start prioritizing experiences over things, traveling, picking up hobbies, reconnecting with old friends, or even making a big career change.

**Mental Health**

Mental health can take a hit in your later years. There’s grief from losing loved ones, anxiety about the future, and even feeling lost. A lot of people hit their 50s or 60s and realize they don’t know who they are outside of work or family responsibilities. That can lead to some deep self-reflection or, for some, a midlife crisis.

**Loneliness**

Retirement sounds great in theory no work, no stress, and free time. But for a lot of people, work was their main source of social interaction. Once that’s gone, it can be really hard to meet new people.

**Housing**

Figuring out housing as you get older is a huge decision. A lot of people start thinking about downsizing, maybe moving into a smaller home, a condo, or even a 55+ community. These places can be great because they’re designed for older adults, often with social activities, maintenance-free living, and a quieter environment. But on the flip side, they can feel too isolated, like living in a bubble with no younger people around.

# 60

**Financial and career Struggles**

A lot of people in their 60s are feeling the pressure when it comes to money and retirement. Some thought they’d be chilling by now, but instead, they’re stressing over savings (or lack of them), pensions that don’t exist, and whether they can actually afford to stop working.

**Getting old**

Then there’s the whole longevity and quality-of-life thing. A lot of people in their 60s are thinking about how to stay independent for as long as possible. Nobody wants to feel like a burden or lose control over their own life, but aging comes with its own challenges.

**Health Concerns**

You wake up feeling tired, and tasks that used to be easy suddenly take twice as much effort. Then there’s the joint pain. It’s not discomfort, it’s a constant battle to keep moving despite the pain. And if you slow down too much, it gets worse.

Cognitive decline is something a lot of people worry about. Maybe it’s forgetting little things here and there or feeling like your brain takes longer to process stuff.

**Loneliness**

Then, there’s the emotional side of aging. Losing friends and family over time can be really tough, and social circles start shrinking. People get busy with their own lives, and sometimes, you realize you’re spending way more time alone than you used to.

**Legacy**

At a certain point, thoughts about legacy and mortality start creeping in more often. It’s not about how much time is left but how to make it count.

It’s also a time for reflection, looking back at the choices made, the paths taken (or not taken), and wondering what kind of impact was left behind. For some, that means giving back, writing a memoir, or making sure they’ve said what needs to be said to the people who matter.

There’s also the reality of how to face the final years with dignity, purpose, and hopefully, peace. No one likes to dwell on mortality, but it’s natural to think about how to make the most of the time that remains.",2,1740870462.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

I joined Kendu months ago when it was blasting from a few million to it's ATH of 280m. I literally joined the community at ath. Since then it's been a downtrend MC wise. At 190m I considered stepping out and even sold part of my bag, only to buy it bag at a lower price. And since then I kept buying. DCA'd all the way down. First buy at 280m and my last few buys were all sub 10m.

Why? Because the community at Kendu is something I've never seen before in crypto. The work done to get Kendu into the normies world with events, Kendu energy drinks, coffee, jewels and artwork is awesome and something on a level that is new to crypto. The way the community keeps working even on the reddest of days is just crazy,

Kendu is a multi billion coin waiting to happen. There is no doubt. You need to have a bag and you need to see what's going on in the Telegram, X and Reddit community.

I’ll make it transform from a normal car to something sick and eye catching. I personally would be more of the car meet, car vlog, type vibe with my videos versus the illegal cutting up or crashout style of car content.

I joined Kendu months ago when it was blasting from a few million to it's ATH of 280m. I literally joined the community at ath. Since then it's been a downtrend MC wise. At 190m I considered stepping out and even sold part of my bag, only to buy it bag at a lower price. And since then I kept buying. DCA'd all the way down. First buy at 280m and my last few buys were all sub 10m.

Why? Because the community at Kendu is something I've never seen before in crypto. The work done to get Kendu into the normies world with events, Kendu energy drinks, coffee, jewels and artwork is awesome and something on a level that is new to crypto. The way the community keeps working even on the reddest of days is just crazy,

Kendu is a multi billion coin waiting to happen. There is no doubt. You need to have a bag and you need to see what's going on in the Telegram, X and Reddit community.

I have definitely gotten better at making friends. Some things I've figured out along the way

* It's often easier to make friends once you have a friend. They may introduce you to others and invite you to events.
* Ever hear so and so did that and think how did they get invited and how could you hear about these? It's often by going to an event with friends that sometimes they might be like oh tomorrow they are doing this hike and do you want to join? Or they mention they are interested in seeing a new movie and that gives you something to check in about in a bit when the movie is about to come out - hey remember hearing you were interested in movie Y - any interest in meeting up to go see it?
* Making friends takes time and effort. 
* If you want to connect with someone at an event, try offering your number to them. Do you want to connect? I can give you my number. Then they can decide whether to text back. But at least they have your number now.
* Have something that you do that you can talk about when asked what do you like to do? Play video games/watch movies and just tend to say not much going on - figure out a movie/game you enjoy and be open to sharing that. 
* When people are planning things and ask for suggestions, give suggestions and your opinions ie if they ask the group where should we go eat - give some suggestions. If you're organizing, try being like here are 3 ideas for where to eat but open to other ideas as well. Organizing is hard - help the others by giving suggestions otherwise it may also look like/be interpreted as you're not super interested.
* Instead of saying we should meet up for coffee sometime, why not suggest want to meet up for coffee at Starbucks on 15th St some evening next week after work? Open to other times/places. You might be worried what if they don't like Starbucks - if you say just want to meet for coffee, they may in their head be thinking you may not like Starbucks if they suggest it. But people often like it when others offer more concrete plans/ideas but also be open to them saying no/suggesting somewhere else/etc.
* I have heard it said that when someone gets into a relationship, they suddenly notice that others are interested in them when they had a hard time getting dates before. I've heard may be due to the energy give off. If you don't have many hobbies, try finding some that you can do that you enjoy even by yourself. Maybe try looking into something like platonic touch workshops/cuddle parties.
* If you trade numbers with someone, reach out after the event and say something like great to meet you/enjoyed our conversation/etc. Then if you want to be friends, probably within a week or two reach out and suggest meeting up for something.

based on my South African grandfather 

The Inheritor

David Harrington's fingers traced the rim of his porcelain cup as he stood on his balcony in Oranjezicht. The coffee—Colombian, freshly ground that morning—had grown cold, forgotten during his ritual contemplation of the awakening city. Before him, Cape Town stirred beneath a sky transitioning from lavender to pale gold. The salt-tinged air carried traces of jasmine from his garden below, mingling with the distant scent of wood smoke from the informal settlements beyond the city bowl.

Three generations of Harringtons had breathed this same air. His grandfather, Edmund, had arrived from Sussex in 1923 with a steamer trunk of possessions and a letter of introduction to the colonial administrator. Within five years, he had established an import business, purchased land, and built the Victorian home where David now lived alone. His father, Richard, had expanded the business during the boom years of the sixties, adding a chain of hardware stores across the Western Cape, constructing his life and fortune alongside the architecture of apartheid, though he had considered himself ""one of the good ones."" And now to David, sixty-three, with his thinning silver hair and academic's stoop, had fallen the family enterprise, the colonial house with its jacaranda trees and gabled façade, and the increasingly complicated question of what it meant to be him, here, now.

The previous evening, David had attended a fundraiser at the V&A Waterfront. A gallery opening for young artists from Khayelitsha and Gugulethu. The white wine had been South African, the canapés artfully arranged by a catering company owned by a former township entrepreneur—a detail mentioned repeatedly by the gallery owner, Philippa, who had once been David's student. The walls had been adorned with vibrant canvases—township scenes reimagined through magical realism, portraits of domestic workers in heroic poses, installations made from repurposed materials gathered from the city dumps.

As the curator had given her speech about ""amplifying marginalized voices,"" David had noticed how the mostly white audience nodded in earnest agreement. He had moved among the crowd with practiced ease afterward, chatting with board members from the university, complimenting Philippa on her ""brave choices."" He'd written a generous check for the artists' foundation. He'd said all the right things about transformation, opportunity, the rainbow nation's promise.

But later, as he'd walked to his German sedan in the underground parking lot, a young man had approached him. He wore a well-cut blazer over a black t-shirt, wire-rimmed glasses perched precisely on his nose.

""Professor Harrington,"" the man had said. David didn't recognize him, though he had clearly taught him at some point during his thirty-year tenure at the university. ""Thabo Nkosi. I was in your 2008 class. Introduction to Western Art.""

""Ah,"" David had responded, searching for a memory that would not materialize. ""Of course. How are you?""

""I'm lecturing at UWC now. Art history and critical theory."" Thabo's expression remained neutral, evaluating. ""I saw you at the gallery. You seemed very...engaged.""

""Yes, remarkable work. So much talent emerging from the townships these days.""

""I'm curious,"" Thabo had said, ignoring the platitude. ""Do you ever wonder if all of this—"" he gestured toward the gallery above them, ""—is just repentance without atonement? A kind of aesthetic absolution that changes nothing material?"" His tone was not accusatory, merely inquiring, which somehow made it worse.

The question had settled in David's chest like a stone, growing heavier with each passing hour.

Now, in the morning light, he carried it with him as he descended the curved staircase from his balcony to the breakfast room, where the newspaper awaited. Headlines about water shortages, corruption investigations, and rugby scores competed for attention. His housekeeper, Gloria Ndlovu, had set out his usual breakfast: sourdough toast, orange marmalade imported from England (a habit he had never broken), and sliced papaya from the garden.

Gloria had been with the Harrington household for thirty-three years. She had come to them from the Eastern Cape when David's mother was still alive, a young woman with a two-year-old son and a reference letter from the minister's wife. Over the decades, David had watched her son, Luthando, grow up, had paid for his schooling at a ""Model C"" school in the suburbs, had written a recommendation for his university application. Luthando now worked as an accountant at a firm in Johannesburg. David had attended his wedding three years ago, had sat uncomfortably at a table with Gloria's extended family, accepting their gratitude with mumbled denials of exceptional generosity.

""Morning, Professor,"" Gloria said, entering with a fresh pot of coffee. Her hair was now streaked with gray, pinned back neatly under a scarf of deep blue and gold. Her uniform—navy dress, white apron—was her own insistence; David had once suggested she might prefer to wear her own clothes, but she had looked at him as if he'd proposed something scandalous.

""Morning, Gloria. How is Themba's schooling coming along?"" Her grandson had recently received a scholarship to Bishops, an elite private school in Rondebosch—an arrangement David had quietly facilitated through an old colleague on the admissions board.

""Very well. He's top in mathematics this term."" Her pride was evident, but reserved. ""His teacher says he might have a future in engineering.""

""That's excellent news,"" David said, pouring coffee that he didn't want. ""Perhaps I could help arrange some career mentoring when the time comes. One of my former students works with that engineering firm that's designing the new desalination plant.""

Gloria nodded, her expression a familiar mixture of gratitude and something else—perhaps resignation, perhaps the recognition of a pattern repeating itself. ""That would be kind of you, Professor. Thank you.""

The space between them was comfortable but unbridgeable—a mutual acknowledgment of boundaries neither wished to cross. After all these years, David still knew remarkably little about Gloria's inner life. Her opinions on politics, her spiritual beliefs, her memories of growing up under apartheid—these were territories they had silently agreed to avoid. David told himself this was respect for her privacy. In his more honest moments, he recognized it as cowardice.

After breakfast, David drove down to the university, the route so familiar he could navigate it in his sleep. The mountain loomed to his left, massive and implacable. The morning light caught on the windows of the affluent homes clinging to its slopes. As he descended into the city, the architecture changed—colonial giving way to modernist, wealth gradually diminishing with each block toward the city center.

Emeritus status granted him an office at the university, though he seldom used it now. Today he needed his books, references for an article he was writing on ""Colonial Aesthetic Influence in Contemporary South African Visual Arts."" The irony of a white man analyzing how African artists processed their colonial inheritance was not lost on him, though he had justified it to himself as scholarly interest, historical documentation.

At a traffic light on De Waal Drive, with the sprawl of Cape Town visible below, a man approached his car window. He carried a collection of wire sculptures—small renditions of Table Mountain, miniature representations of the Big Five animals, elaborate beaded flowers. The man's hands were weathered, his fingertips calloused from manipulating wire. His jacket was too heavy for the day's growing warmth.

David initially waved him away with the practiced gesture of the perpetually solicited. Then, seized by a sudden compulsion he didn't fully understand, he rolled down his window and purchased a wire giraffe, its neck extending improbably from its delicate body, every vertebra and marking rendered with painstaking attention.

""Where did you learn to make these?"" David asked, the academic in him genuinely curious, the human in him uncomfortably aware of the transactional nature of their interaction.

""My father taught me. In Zimbabwe."" The man's accent confirmed his origins. ""Before the troubles.""

""You're very skilled,"" David said, an observation that felt simultaneously true and patronizing. ""What's your name?""

""Tafadzwa,"" the man replied. Then the light changed. Cars behind David honked impatiently. A taxi driver shouted something indecipherable but clearly irritated.

""Thank you, Tafadzwa,"" David said, accelerating away, the exchange abruptly terminated by the city's impatient rhythm.

In his rearview mirror, Tafadzwa was already approaching the next car, holding up his wares with the same hopeful gesture. The wire giraffe sat on David's passenger seat, its form casting a complex shadow on the leather upholstery. He found himself wondering how many giraffes Tafadzwa needed to sell to feed himself for a day, to send money home perhaps, to pay for whatever accommodations he had found in this city of stark inequalities. Then he pushed the thought away, uncomfortable with its implications.

The university campus spread across the slopes of Devil's Peak, its colonial architecture a testament to its origins and aspirations. Once, this place had felt like a sanctuary to David. Now it seemed to regard him with ambivalence. Young students hurried past, engrossed in their own concerns. A few wore t-shirts emblazoned with political slogans: ""Decolonize Education"" and ""Fees Must Fall."" They looked through him as if he were already a ghost.

In his seldom-used office, dust had settled on the mahogany desk—his father's before him, salvaged from the family business when David had sold it five years after Richard's death. The leather chair creaked familiarly as he settled into it. Photographs lined the bookshelves—David receiving academic awards, shaking hands with visiting European scholars, standing beside his daughter at her graduation.

Sarah lived in Toronto now, having left South Africa after completing her medical degree. ""It's not about politics, Dad,"" she'd insisted over their last dinner together at the waterfront. ""It's about opportunity. About being able to practice medicine without dealing with a failing healthcare system."" Her husband, James, a fellow doctor she'd met during residency, had nodded in solemn agreement. David hadn't believed her explanation then. He wasn't sure he did now, three years later. Their weekly video calls were cordial but increasingly distant. His granddaughter, Olivia, was growing up without any real connection to the country of her mother's birth.

The books he needed were arranged precisely where he'd left them, their spines faded but intact. He ran his fingers along their edges, the familiar texture offering small comfort. A volume on Irma Stern fell open to a dog-eared page where he had once underlined a passage about her appropriation of African aesthetics. He stared at his own handwriting in the margin: ""Colonial gaze or genuine appreciation?"" The question seemed both naïve and essential now.

As he gathered his materials, noting pages with colored markers, a knock came at the door. It was Nkosazana Dlamini, the new head of the Art History department. She wore a tailored blazer over a traditional print dress, her locks swept up in an elaborate style that framed her face. Forty-something, with a doctorate from SOAS in London, she had a reputation for intellectual rigor and unapologetic politics.

""David,"" she said, her voice warm despite the formality in her posture. ""I thought I might find you here. Do you have a moment?""

They sat across from each other, the desk between them—a piece of furniture that had witnessed three generations of Harrington authority now serving as a kind of demarcation line. Nkosazana spoke about planned curriculum changes, the push to include more African artists and perspectives, to recontextualize the European canon that had dominated the department's offerings for decades.

""We're not erasing Western art history,"" she said, leaning forward slightly. ""We're providing context, showing interconnections, acknowledging influence flowing in multiple directions.""

David nodded, though something in him clenched defensively. These were the courses he had designed, taught, refined over decades. His intellectual legacy.

""The department values your expertise,"" Nkosazana continued, perhaps sensing his discomfort. ""We'd like you to consult on the transition, help us ensure we're not losing valuable perspectives while we expand the curriculum.""

""I'm not sure I'm the right person,"" David said, though he had prepared extensive notes on just such a consultation, anticipating that his experience might still have currency.

""That's precisely why I'm asking,"" Nkosazana said, her gaze direct but not unkind. ""You represent a scholarly tradition we're trying to contextualize, to place in proper relation to other traditions. We need your knowledge, even as we move beyond some of its limitations.""

""Repentance without atonement,"" David murmured, the phrase surfacing unbidden.

""Pardon?""

""Something someone said to me recently. A former student. About gestures without substance. About acknowledging problems without actually changing the systems that created them.""

Nkosazana studied him, her expression neither hostile nor particularly sympathetic—more curious, as if he were a text she was attempting to interpret.

""And what do you think atonement looks like, in this context?"" she asked finally. ""Not just in academia, but in South Africa more broadly?""

""If I knew that,"" David said, ""perhaps I would sleep better.""

A silence stretched between them, filled with the ambient sounds of the university beyond his office walls—students laughing in the corridor, a distant lecture filtering through an open window, the persistent Cape Town wind finding gaps in the old building's framework.

""My grandfather,"" Nkosazana said eventually, ""was a gardener for a family in Bishopscourt. Worked there forty years. The family helped put my mother through school. They thought they were very progressive."" She paused, straightening a paper clip on his desk. ""They never once asked him what he wanted, though. Never asked if gardening was his passion, or just what was available to him. Never asked about his dreams for himself.""

She let the implication hang between them.

""What happened to him?"" David asked.

""He died during forced removals. Heart attack when the police came to District Six."" She delivered this information without drama, a historical fact. ""The family sent flowers to the funeral. They never visited our new house in Gugulethu, though.""

Before David could formulate a response, she stood. ""Think about the curriculum consultation. Take your time. But not too much time—the world is changing, with or without our permission."" Her smile took any sting from the words. ""Call my office when you've decided.""

After she left, David sat alone, contemplating the wire giraffe he had placed at the edge of his desk. Outside, the mountain was visible through his window—permanent, impassive. The cloud tablecloth was beginning to form along its ridge, promising afternoon rain.

He thought about his grandfather, Edmund, who had arrived with nothing but English confidence and the certainty that the world was his to claim. He had never learned to speak Afrikaans, let alone Xhosa or Zulu. His journals, which David had inherited along with the house, spoke of Africa as a project, of its people as either obstacles or instruments to progress.

He thought about his father, Richard, who had navigated the apartheid years with a careful combination of private misgivings and public compliance. ""It's more complicated than the foreign press makes it seem,"" he had often said at dinner parties. He had paid his workers better than most, had established a small scholarship fund for their children. Had voted for the National Party until his death.

And he thought about himself, caught now between inherited privilege and genuine desire to belong to a place that had never really invited him to stay. His academic career had coincided with the transition to democracy. He had published papers on the democratization of art spaces, had championed the inclusion of black artists in the university gallery. Had continued to live in the family home in Oranjezicht, had sent his daughter to private school, had maintained membership at the Kelvin Grove Club where the majority of faces still resembled his own.

The rain began as he walked to his car, fat drops that darkened the pavement in expanding circles. David did not hurry. The books he'd collected were heavy in his leather satchel. The wire giraffe was cool in his hand, unexpectedly solid despite its seemingly fragile construction. He placed it carefully on the back seat, positioning it so it wouldn't fall during the drive home. A small, futile gesture of protection.

That evening, as darkness settled over the city, David sat at his desk at home, surrounded by books and notes for his article. Words failed him. The question remained lodged in his chest: what did atonement look like? Not charity, which preserved the dynamics it pretended to address. Not academic discourse, which often transformed lived injustice into theoretical abstractions. Perhaps not even the relinquishing of material advantage, which could itself become a kind of performance if not accompanied by deeper reckonings.

From his study window, he could see the township lights flickering on the Cape Flats, a galaxy of human persistence. Between his privileged perch and those distant lights lay a geography he had studied but never truly known—the lived reality of most of his countrymen. His Cape Town and theirs existed in parallel dimensions, occasionally intersecting but never truly merging.

David's phone rang, interrupting his contemplation. It was Sarah from Toronto.

""Dad? Are you there?"" Her voice sounded tinny, distant in more ways than one.

""I'm here,"" he said, turning from the window.

""Just checking in. You usually call on Wednesdays.""

""I've been distracted,"" he admitted. ""Work things.""

""The article? How's it coming?"" She sounded genuinely interested, though he suspected she was simultaneously doing something else—cooking dinner perhaps, or sorting through medical files.

""It's...evolving. I'm reconsidering some of my initial premises.""

""That sounds intriguing."" A pause. ""Are you eating properly? Is Gloria still making sure you don't subsist on toast and marmalade?""

""Gloria takes good care of me,"" he said automatically, the phrase well-worn between them.

""Good. Oh, James wants to know if you've thought any more about selling the house? His colleague is still interested in investing in Cape Town property.""

David glanced around the study, with its high ceilings and ornate cornices, its shelves of books accumulated over generations. ""I'm not ready for that conversation, Sarah.""

""It's just—it's a lot of house for one person, Dad. And the political situation—""

""The political situation has been complex for three hundred years,"" he interrupted, more sharply than he intended. ""The house isn't going anywhere.""

A silence stretched between them, five continents wide.

""Olivia has a piano recital next week,"" Sarah said finally, changing the subject. ""I'll send you the video.""

After they hung up, David returned to the window. The cloud cover had broken, revealing a scatter of stars above the city. He thought about Tafadzwa, standing at traffic lights selling wire art to uninterested motorists. About Nkosazana's grandfather, tending gardens for a family that sent flowers to his funeral but never visited Gugulethu. About Gloria's grandson, Themba, navigating the halls of a school where his presence was still considered exceptional.

David had spent his career analyzing art as cultural artifact, as historical document, as aesthetic achievement. He had taught generations of students to see beyond the surface, to understand context and subtext. Yet he had somehow failed to apply this same analytical rigor to his own position in the unfolding story of South Africa.

The wire giraffe stood on his bookshelf now, its neck extending toward the ceiling, its form both delicate and resilient. In the morning, David decided, he would drive to the traffic light where he had met Tafadzwa. He would wait, however long necessary. He would ask about Zimbabwe, about learning the craft from his father. About where he stayed in Cape Town, about his experience of this city that presented such different faces to different people.

It would change nothing substantial in the larger patterns of inequality. It would not undo centuries of colonialism or decades of apartheid. It would not even meaningfully alter Tafadzwa's material circumstances. But it would be a beginning—not of repentance, perhaps, but of seeing. Of allowing himself to be seen, not as a benefactor or a scholar or a representative of colonial legacy, but simply as a man attempting, however imperfectly, to belong to a place that was still in the process of becoming itself.

After that, perhaps, he would call Nkosazana about the curriculum consultation. Would offer his knowledge while acknowledging its limitations. Would listen more than he spoke.

These were small beginnings, inadequate to the scale of history. But perhaps that was all anyone could truly offer—the willingness to begin, again and again, the difficult work of genuine presence.",1,1740869753.0,writers,1,0.67,False

I rewatched the films I haven't seen in a long time (like Part 8) and I wanna see what y'all think.

>The rules are simple. One, the film's genre can't be changed (that' s a given). Two, the improvements have to adhere to the basic plotline of the film in question.

>Honestly, for the original Friday the 13th, an obvious improvement would be giving the film a bigger budget, especially since the nighttime scenes aren't very well lit. Another obvious fix would be hiring better actors for certain characters, example: Marcy's acting during her death scene wasn't exactly the best.

>Another thing that would improve the film is not killing a real snake, because the scene is just so hard to get through when you know that you're watching a real fucking animal getting killed on screen. Steve, and the two counselors from the beginning of the film could also use better death scenes, since the guy counselor and Steve just got stabbed below the screen, and while the girl counselor's death is kind of cold, it is pretty lame for a franchise that's partly known for it's gory kills (that and Jason.) Scream had a gory death that lead into the title card, for example.

>I also wish Ned didn't get an off screen death. Yeah, we see his dead body, but it would be so satisfying if that annoying fuck head got a really gory death scene, instead of just an off screen one.

>Probably the biggest thing that could improve the film is actually making Pamela's reveal as the killer work better. Keeping the killers identity hidden for the whole movie and setting up this sense of mystery, and this almost whodunit story kind of falls flat when the killer is a character who isn't revealed until a few minutes before her reveal. There could've at least been a prominent scene with her in the beginning so that you know she exist, like what they did with William Afton in the FNAF movie. At least the killer wouldn't be a character who's revealed out of nowhere.

Edit: The film could also use less filler scenes. Like... we don't need to see the whole ass process of making coffee.

But that's just my opinion. What do y'all think would improve this film?

  
So then I wrote this...

I'd turn the heat up on that summer so all the chicks aren't wearing shirts the entire runtime (including Mrs. Voorhees).  Speaking of runtime, it's gonna be about 30mins longer due to all action these kids will be getting.  Crazy Ralph will be the star of the film (his character will be fleshed out to be more akin to an Ernest P Worrel by way of test subject for the new drug Vicodin).  

The new means of death for the counselors--who are also all part of a folk-rock band (think Pure Prairie League but they go by CCL) that will play at least 3 full songs, so lets bump that runtime up again to 2h25mins--will be syphilis and the Jersey Devil, who gets a love scene with Mrs. Voorhees as they are in cahoots and canoodles.  

Crazy Ralph auditions for CCL before the end of summer rager, as the original lead singer has died from syphilis.  Turns out, Crazy Ralph can kind of shred and gets the gig, which is sure to impress his girlfriend, Titly Horesaus, who's coming to visit him from college (she's pre med at Stanford).

So it's rage-o-clock and the Jersey Devil just about fucks err'ybody up, save for Crazy Ralph and Titly.  Just before the Jersey Devil is going to beboob Titly and bedong Crazy Ralph (be-donging and be-boobing are the Jersey Devils version of beheading, he's weird), they espouse their eternal love for one another in a song (we're gonna bump that runtime up to a breezy 2hr45mins).  Mrs. Voorhees, upon hearing the tune, titled ""Doomed For Love"", calls off the Jersey Devil who wipes a tear from his eye.  

Epilogue

Crazy Ralph and Titly are adrift in the lake on a boat, he serenades her with another song (bump that runtime up a bit annnnd we're a double VHS just like The Godfathers) when ALL OF THE SUDDEN:

Jason pops out of the water wearing his BRAND NEW MASK:  a snorkel.  He gives our lovers a good scare before all three erupt with laughter.  Mrs. Voorhees and the Jersey Devil are calling from the dock, ""Hope you kids are hungry!  We got enough hotdogs to choke a hooker!""

The word ""hooker"" begins echoing through Crazy Ralphs head, ""hooker--hooker---hooker"".  A flashback reveals that Mrs. Voorhees was in fact a prostitute and his mother.  She gave him up for adoption, but the hospital instead kept him, testing various new drugs on him, causing him to forget and giving him the ability to shred like a God...

He goes full-bore shithouse in the boat, rips off Titly's boobs and drowns Jason.  Mrs. Voorhees begins screaming for the Jersey Devil to kill Ralph, who can not only shred but rows boat like a mother fucker as he coasts to the dock.  The Jersey Devil begins to fly and deliver a deathblow to Ralph...but Crazy is as Crazy does, and Crazy Ralph be-dongs the Jersey Devil mid flight.  Our old friend, JD, bleeds out to death from his reeking leak hole. 

Mrs. Voorhees stands before a defiant, maniacal Crazy Ralph--as if he couldn't get any crazier--he draws his guitar from only heaven knows where and begins to play...
