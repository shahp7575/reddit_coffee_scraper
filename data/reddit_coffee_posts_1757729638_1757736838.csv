1nfnv1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeedToTalk/comments/1nfnv1m/venting_about_my_pathic_gay_life/,Venting about my pathic gay life," don’t know how to start this…

One day I was grocery shopping and I saw two beautiful, happy couples with their little daughter. I don’t know why, but I felt phased out. I stood there, staring at them from a distance. They looked so happy—a beautiful, happy family. A moment later, I collapsed to the ground and started crying. I felt sad knowing I’ll never have what they have. I couldn’t help myself up. I felt weak, and no one helped me or asked how I was doing. Just stares from strangers that made me feel emptier and even weirder.

So let me start by saying this: I’m from Kuwait, and I’m 23 years old. I just want love and happiness.

I’ll try to keep this as short and clear as possible.

My existence—my only goal—is to find love.

I tried many dating apps, hookups, but most of the time I would just end up being used, or worse. Maybe it’s the people in Kuwait—most don’t care, they just want something quick and cheap. It’s to the point that many of them aren’t even gay, they just want fast sex. My experiences in my own country were horrible. I was hurt more than once to the point that I started to hate my own country. Maybe it was just bad luck, and I want to believe not everyone is like that, but still… it scarred me.

I took a break from seeing anyone in Kuwait, but I can’t resist my own nature. It makes me unhappy. Later, when I was 22, I made an NSFW account on Twitter and Reddit. That was my first “sexual experience,” where people online called me beautiful. For a while, I enjoyed it—foreigners complimenting me, telling me I was pretty—but eventually, I felt disgusted and cheap. Loved in the cheapest way possible. I stopped and hated myself for it.

Months later, I was playing PlayStation and I met someone from Saudi Arabia. I loved his accent. He was kind to me, first as a friend, but over months our relationship grew deeper. We bonded over our struggles—he was gay, I was gay—and he was only 4 hours away from me. The bond was strong. The love between a Kuwaiti and a Saudi… it felt beautiful. It was everything I wanted. But then he told me he had just turned 19, while I was 22 turning 23. I felt guilty. It was a hard decision, but I had to let him go for his own sake. He was too young. He didn’t understand, he was sad, but I wanted him to find someone closer to his age.

Weeks later, I missed speaking to someone with a Saudi accent. I loved his culture, everything about it. I was sad, lonely, and depressed, so I returned to my old stupid habit. I made a new NSFW account on Twitter, but this time my goal was different—I wanted to find love, not just strangers. I focused on Saudis. I went viral. I gained 13,000 followers in just months. Many people came to me—ugly, beautiful, old, young. But despite the popularity, I still felt empty.

Among all those people, I had a crush on one. Let’s call him Naïf. He followed me back. I couldn’t believe it. He told me he liked me. We chatted, but he was realistic—he said, “You’re in Kuwait, I’m in Saudi.” He told me, though, if I ever came to Saudi, we should meet. I agreed.

At the same time, a weird follower of mine DM’d me saying he knew Naïf and they were friends. Naïf was my obsession, so I kept talking to this mutual friend, even though he was creepy. I just wanted to know more about Naïf. That “friend” only wanted to sleep with me, which I didn’t want.

A month ago, I came to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for the first time. I drove there alone—the road was tough, but I made it. During that trip, the mutual friend kept hinting that Naïf didn’t like me, which made me sad. On the third day of my trip, Naïf texted me asking to go for coffee. I don’t know why, but I refused. I was so weighed down by the ugly things the mutual friend told me that I said no. I regret it deeply. I went back to Kuwait without seeing Naïf.

Today, as I’m typing this, I’m back in Saudi. I’m on my third day here. Yesterday, I finally met Naïf. I was so happy. It was the best day of my life. He came late at night to my apartment. Even though I was tired and sleepy, I felt like I was in heaven. He told me I was his type. He kissed me nonstop. But deep down, I couldn’t believe him.

Why? Because he’s genuinely so beautiful. I don’t say this just because I like him—he’s systemically, almost perfectly attractive. He has so many hot followers, so why me? At best, I’m a 7. He’s an 11. I love him though. I really do. I want him as my husband. But he hasn’t texted me back. He said he won’t cut communication, but my messages are still unanswered. To be fair, it’s Friday, the weekend, maybe he’s busy.

But I’m scared. I want him so badly. I’m not that pretty. I stutter. I have ADHD. And he’s perfect. I don’t think I have a real chance.

Yet, when I saw him, I also felt like he was a little sad. I related to that. I wish I could help him. I wish I could be with him",1,1757736413.0,NeedToTalk,1,1.0,False

As you can read by the title, I'm now losing trust on my bf since I constantly am witnessing how he lies to others in front of me. 

One time, somebody called my bf and he went ""Oh, I’m sorry I’m having an emergency right here, I can’t come"" although we were literally just chilling drinking coffee. I let it slide. 

2nd time around - he messaged me he already got home at a certain time = the following day, unfortunately I went thru his phone and I've seen a Facebook message from his male cousin asking where my bf at the night before. 

My bf replied he's ""not yet"" at home even if it was also the time he also informed me that he jgh. 

When asked about it, he said he was genuinely already at home and resting ; and he’s just trying to decline his cousin since he is anticipating that maybe, his cousin will invite him somewhere and he.just.didnt. feel like going out again. 

3rd time - his dad called him asking where he is. He said he’s already in a certain place OTW home but we are literally still on a date eating something and clearly not yet heading home nor in a specific place near them. 

4th time - his other cousin called him (i know its really his cousin since i heard his voice) my bf says he’s at work doing overtime but were literally on a date again so he aint doing no overtime. 

When confronted that I dont trust him anymore due to his lies he said I am his ""girlfriend and he therefore treats me differently among the others"". He said that he didnt wanna be with them thats why he just put up a lie. 

But this is unsettling. I let it all slide since I know we all make white lies sometimes but how far can this lying actually go???

What happened?","I honestly can’t remember the last time someone offered me anything other than tea, coffee or a packaged juice when I visited their home.

Every street corner has a tea stall or a coffee shop in Telangana. No exclusive majiga  stall? No Ragi malt? Maybe still there in some village. How did this happen?

Tea & coffee are not ours and were introduced to us by the British in the 19th century. British planters scaled up tea in Assam and coffee in the south, and created a market.

Buttermilk, millet drinks and jaggery sherbets which form our ancient welcome drinks for a 1000 years were never industrialised or marketed the same way.

Urbanisation  made hot caffeinated drinks more attractive and addictive, while the good old healthy drinks got labelled as village or festival-only.

As a result a 1,000-year-old Telugu hospitality got replaced in just 150 years.

Can we not change this and restart our age old forgotten culture?

Can’t we have majiga, ragi malt and Panakam points/carts outside colleges and offices instead of tea and coffee points? They are healthy and rich in electrolytes too. Will that be a good idea? Or is it impossible now?",3,1757735781.0,u_Internal-Bullfrog967,0,1.0,False

1. I can't afford it. Even though I am working a full time job. With how much basic needs cost. After all the bills are paid and making sure I have enough to get things like gas, food and other things I need throughout the month. And putting a little bit of money aside for savings for a rainy day. I only have 20 bucks left for what I call 'play money' and some months depending on things I might not even have that. So how do I raise a kid with that? I mean I think diapers would cost that if not more alone.

2. I think due to how my parents treated me. I have a dislike for the idea of having kids. As a teenager my dad used to make comments saying I'll be a 30 year old verigin. Because he wanted me to get knocked up. So he had that excuse to throw me out. Because he hated the fact I was becoming a woman and so he had to spend a little bit of money to help me with the whole time of month thing. Rather then him spending it on himself. Which made me feel horrible for the normal woman body things that I have no freaking control of. And my mom as I hit adult age started pushing having kids on me. Even though I had no interest.

3. Kids are so freaking annoying. I don't mind them or have anything against them. But I'm like how do people not go crazy when dealing with there screaming? Like I can't tell you how many times I'm in a store or even the coffee shop. And there is a kid screaming bloody murder and throwing a full on fit.

Right now, I’m sitting here alone, low-key questioning my decision to come out alone. 🥲

Everyone around me seems to be with someone, loved ones, friends, or partners.

Right in front of me is a family having a quiet meal. Next to them, there’s a woman with her daughter and another woman with her son. Maybe it’s a first meeting for marriage? I don’t know; I’m just guessing.

To my left are two good-looking guys working on their laptops. One of them has something stuck to the back of his MacBook, and I kept staring at it until I figured out it’s a phone stand. Clever.

Behind me, there’s a group of friends, laughing, gossiping, just having a good time.

And to my right, a couple, probably on a date, deep in conversation.

And then there’s me. Sitting quietly. Writing this post. Trying to act like solo dates are something I do all the time.

I’m a little nervous, but I don’t know why. I feel okay, just… in my own head.

Being out alone makes you notice things more, the energy of people, the details of your surroundings, the tiny awkward moments you usually miss.

It’s a little uncomfortable, I won’t lie. But it also feels like a small act of self-love. Like saying to myself: You deserve your own time, your own company, your own attention.

I think solo dates are less about food or coffee and more about learning to sit with yourself, without distractions or validation.

So here I am. Sitting. Observing. Breathing. And learning that maybe being with myself isn’t so strange after all.

1nfn4lp,https://i.redd.it/3a5oe6cupuof1.jpeg,I’ve found myself in a predicament. Need advice.,"I was recently asked to make vegan cinnamon rolls for the coffee shop I work for. We usually only do cookies, scones and muffins but a while back they did sourdough cinnamon rolls and they were always a hit. But because the sourdough took three days to get started my managers asked me to make them using yeast in hopes of cutting down the lengthy process. 
While testing new recipes and honing in on proportions I asked to see the old sourdough recipe just to gauge how much flour they were using since I’ve never made this many cinnamon rolls before. (About 72 4”x4” rolls.)
Here comes the part that I need help with. While looking over the old recipe that was previously used I saw that it said honey on it. Now I personally am not vegan, but one of the co-owners is and I respect that just as much as I’d respect a food allergy. 
When I brought this up to the person that was in charge of making the cinnamon rolls in the past all she did was say “shhh” with a finger to her lips. This does not sit well with me. I’m assuming that means she knowingly made non vegan rolls but told everyone they were vegan. 
I don’t know what to do now. Do I let the vegan co-owner know? Will it make a difference at all since it’s in the past? Would you want to know if you were in this situation? 
On top of that it’s making me look at my coworker differently since I could never knowingly do something like that. ",24,1757734072.0,VeganBaking,10,1.0,False

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

The deadlines loom, the readings pile up, and progress feels slow. Staying consistent is often harder than the actual writing.

Here are a few strategies that have worked for me and my peers:

* **Break it into milestones:** Instead of seeing it as one huge task, divide it into chapters, sections, or even “2-hour work blocks.”
* **Set small rewards:** A coffee break, an episode of a show, or just stepping outside can help reset your focus after completing a section.
* **Switch formats when stuck:** If reading gets heavy, watch a lecture, sketch a concept map, or even discuss ideas with friends.
* **Use accountability:** Studying with a friend or checking in with a peer group keeps you honest and moving forward.
* **Reflect on the purpose:** Remind yourself why this topic matters for your course, career, or personal growth -the “why” can be motivating.

For example, when I worked on a 6,000-word paper last term, I set up a timeline where I wrote 500–600 words per day. On tough days, I reminded myself that consistent small steps would add up. By week two, I had most of my draft ready — way less stressful than cramming it all in the final week.

I’ve noticed platforms like **Assignment in Need** and other academic communities often emphasise chunking and scheduling as key, which aligns with what actually works in practice.

Walking through the polished marble atrium of Bahrain Financial Harbour early one Sunday, clutching a battered folder of company documents, an espresso from a Diplomatic Area kiosk in my other hand—I realized just how deeply place and process intertwine in the Kingdom. The sun rose behind Bahrain Bay’s glass towers. A few minutes earlier, I’d been at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOICT) branch in Seef District, waiting behind old hands in flowing bishts and ambitious fintech founders in sharp suits, all hoping to clear the crucial first step of Bahrain company formation: securing a business name.\
The stakes? Massive. The wrong name, or a misstep in reservation, can delay your business launch by weeks and cost you precious BHDs. But with the right know-how, you can breeze through the process—saving money, time, and frustration. Drawing on my hands-on experience and latest 2025 regulatory updates (thank you, Forbes Business and Reuters for the fresh stats), I’ll walk you through everything you need to know, with actionable tips, hidden traps, and hard-won hacks.\
\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals..\
Local customs still matter. Expect a firm handshake, traditional coffee, and even a quick majlis chat before business truly begins. During Ramadan, plan for shorter working hours and slower documentation cycles, but more focused, high-trust conversations.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. on Sijilat to opening local bank accounts. Lose your preferred name, and you risk redoing documents, contracts, and branding.\
Bahrain’s process is transparent, but beware: new 2025 MOICT circulars have tightened name uniqueness checks and raised rejection rates by 15%, especially for “global” or generic-sounding brands.\
\
Step-By-Step: Name Reservation Process in Bahrain\
1. Choose the Perfect Name—And Check Availability\
\
Sijilat Portal: All business name checks and reservations begin with Sijilat.\
Tip: Get creative but stay compliant. Names implying government endorsement, religious significance, or containing restricted words (like “Bank,” “Royal”) will be instantly declined.\
2025 Update: Non-Arabic names must now be registered with an exact Arabic translation, aligned with Bahrain.com naming guidelines.\
\
Personal Challenge\
I once had a promising fintech client whose English name was approved instantly but the Arabic equivalent was flagged for religious connotation—costing us three extra days and two extra fees. Now, I double-check proposed Arabic renderings with both a native speaker and the MOICT-approved glossary.\
Expert Hack: Use the Keylink resource on types of entities to pick a name structure compatible with your chosen format (LLC, S.P.C., Branch, etc.).\
2. Prepare and Upload the Required Documents\
\
ID Copy: Passport/CPR for Bahraini or GCC nationals; passport and resident visa for expats.\
Draft MOA: Some structures require a Memorandum of Association (MOA) draft at this stage.\
Name Justification Letter: For coined, foreign, or similar-sounding names—required in many 2025 cases.\
\
Insider Shortcut: I pre-draft the MOA template and justification letter for every new client, using past approvals as a reference. At Seef MOICT, early morning Tuesday slots (8:00–9:30am) have the shortest queue.\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.:\
  - Upload documents, pay reservation fee by debit/credit card.\
  - Track status in real time—average review time is 1–3 working days (2025 update: some high-demand sectors now take 4–5 days).\
- In-Person:**\
  - Go to the MOICT branch at Seef Mall, Diplomatic Area, or Muharraq.\
  - Enjoy traditional Bahraini coffee if you’re lucky; don’t forget to bring printed copies!\
Common Mistake: Many first-time founders submit incomplete applications or use ambiguous names, leading to rejection and delays. Always preview your application with a local consultant.\
4. Pay the Name Reservation Fee\
\
Standard Fee: 25–30 BHD for most company types (2025 rates).\
Premium/Trade Names: 50–100 BHD for specialized, high-value, or internationalized names.\
\
Track the latest fee structure and potential hidden costs at Keylink’s detailed guide.\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs..\
- With your confirmed name, immediately begin commercial registration, lease signing, and visa processing—timing is everything!\
\
Business Structure: Choosing the Right Format Before Name Reservation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. to WLL (With Limited Liability), Joint Venture, and Branch. Pick wisely—name format and reservation requirements hinge on your choice.\
\
Foreign Ownership: Bahrain uniquely allows 99-100% foreign ownership. Recent EDB guidelines (2025) have extended this to more than 400 commercial activities.\
Sponsorship: While not required for most new ventures, some sectors still require a local sponsor.\
\
Tangent: You might have heard of Tamkeen grants for Bahraini SMEs, but did you know they occasionally cover name reservation fees for strategic sectors like green tech or cloud computing? A client in Bahrain Bay recently secured such support—never hurts to ask.\
\
Comparison to UAE/KSA: Unlike Dubai or Riyadh, Bahrain rarely requires a local partner outside of a few regulated industries, slashing red tape and wait times.\
\
\
Insiders’ Time and Money-Saving Tips\
\
Best Timings: Submit Monday–Wednesday, 8:00–10:00am via Sijilat. Avoid post-Ramadan rush and late-week queues.\
Optimal Locations: Seef MOICT branch is least crowded. At Bahrain Financial Harbour, the EDB one-stop-shop is fast for fintech or international companies.\
Document Perfection: Pre-validate every Arabic translation. Bring both digital and hard copies.\
Keep Buffer Funds: Always set aside 50–60 BHD for unexpected resubmissions—2025’s tighter controls have increased resubmission rates!\
Consult a Pro: Use Keylink’s company formation process guide for step-by-step templates.\

Navigating 2025 Regulatory Updates and Common Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. are under heavier scrutiny.\
My Fix: I now run names through two databases—Sijilat and the wider GCC registry—before submission. Saves tears and BHDs.\
Mistake Prevention\
\
Don’t use “Holding,” “National,” or “Gulf” unless you can justify regional operations.\
Always keep track of your 30-day reservation expiry—set calendar reminders.\
Network locally: informal chats with MOICT reviewers (ideally over coffee, in an informal majlis corner) can uncover name acceptance nuances that don’t appear in the portal’s published guidelines.\

\
Costs and Budgeting for Name Reservation – What to Expect\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.; up to 100 BHD (premium/trade).\
- Consultancy/Agent Fees: 50–150 BHD, depending on special services or urgent handling.\
- Additional Translation Fees: 10–20 BHD if Arabic support is needed.\
See the full breakdown at Keylink’s Bahrain company formation cost page.\
Budget Range:\
- DIY Online: 25–50 BHD\
- Full-Service via Agent: 100–250 BHD\
- Complex/Foreign Trademarks: 200–400 BHD\
Financial Planning Tip\
Batch your entire pre-formation paperwork (name reservation, draft MOA, lease draft) and submit same-day—some agents offer multi-service discounts.\
\
Free Zone and Special Economic Area Benefits\
Entrepreneurs targeting logistics, e-commerce, or fintech should explore Bahrain’s Free Zones.\
Name reservation here follows similar rules, but approvals are typically prioritized—especially for international trade.\
\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Post-Formation Steps\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. are mandatory for CR approval.\
- Renewals: Annual CR renewals require ongoing compliance and up-to-date records.\
- Regulatory Audits: Be ready for MOICT spot-checks, especially after name changes or business scope shifts.\
Use local specialists who know Bahrain’s regulatory quirks—not all Gulf compliance officers understand the Kingdom’s distinct practices.\
\
Support Resources and Professional Guidance\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. for full timing details.\
Q2: Can foreigners reserve a company name without a local partner?\
\
Yes! Up to 99–100% foreign ownership is permitted (ownership guide), unless you’re in a restricted industry. The full list is here.\
\
Q3: What if my reserved name is rejected?\
\
Edit, resubmit, pay the fee again, and double-check Arabic spellings. Pro tip: Seek local advice to pre-clear names.\
\
Q4: Do I need a physical office or can I use a virtual address?\
\
Some sectors allow virtual offices, but many require a Bahrain-based lease for CR approval. Popular zones: Seef District, Bahrain Bay, and Diplomatic Area. More on commercial registration.\
\
Q5: Where can I get ongoing regulatory and bookkeeping support?\
\
Keylink’s accounting services are reliable and always up-to-date on Bahrain’s changing rules.\
\
\
\
Bahrain’s business landscape rewards agility and attention to local nuance. With the right name—and the right approach—you can launch your enterprise in the very heart of the Gulf. I’ve been there, queueing outside MOICT at dawn, navigating both official rules and the human rhythms of Bahraini business. Now, with this guide and a handful of proven shortcuts, your journey should be a whole lot smoother.\
\
Wherever you start—Seef, Bahrain Bay, or beyond—choose wisely, act quickly, and always have your Arabic translation double-checked!\

Hey everyone,
I’m a 24M and honestly have never dated in my entire life. About 2 months back, I got a marriage proposal from a family in my city. (23F)

So far:

We met the first time when our families arranged it. But our family was together during the first day.

We met the second time about 40–50 days later near my workplace and had some coffee.

Yesterday, I finally took her out for a proper dinner date.

Now, her family has said yes, and my family has also said yes. My family’s thinking is that they’d like me to get married by 2026 (next year). They’re not forcing me, but they also don’t want us to be in a 3–4 year relationship only for it to end in rejection later. (Because you never know).  And her family is saying even if the girl doesn't agree on marriage next year they might just get us engaged still decision being on girl. Basically, the decision is completely up to me and the girl. (90% on the girl)

The problem is, I’ve never been in a relationship before. I have no clue how to proceed from here. I just have 2 main questions:

What should I actually do after this stage of meeting and dating? How do I build things with her?

What should the frequency of messaging or meeting be? I don’t want to seem too much, but also don’t want to be too distant.

I feel like a complete idiot when it comes to dating/relationships, so any advice from people who’ve been through arranged marriage or even just early dating would be really appreciated.",7,1757733318.0,Arrangedmarriage,5,1.0,False

I have two problems.

1. The dough is extremely dense and sticky, almost impossible to handle! I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be or not.

2. As the title says, they don't absorb the coffee well; the center ends up completely dry.

In my country, ladyfingers are only sold once a year at HEB, during the Italian season or something like that, lol

  
Ladyfingers 



Ingredients:

• 3 eggs

• 1/2 cup sugar (divided)

• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

• 1 cup flour

• 5 teaspoons cornstarch

• Powdered sugar



Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Prepare the yolks: In a large bowl, place the 3 egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, and the vanilla extract. Beat at medium speed until pale and fluffy.

3. Beat the egg whites: In another clean bowl, beat the 3 egg whites at high speed. While beating, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar until the egg whites are stiff and glossy.

4. Fold the egg whites into the yolks: Briefly beat the egg yolk mixture again to ensure it is well blended. Then, fold the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture in several batches, folding until well combined.

5. Add the dry ingredients: Sift the flour and cornstarch into the egg mixture. Gently fold in a small amount, folding gently until no dry residue remains. It is important to avoid lumps.

6. Shape the cakes: Transfer the mixture to a piping bag. Shape into logs approximately 10 cm (4 inches) long and 2.5 cm (1 inch) wide on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle generously with powdered sugar.

7. Bake: Bake for 13-15 minutes, or until lightly golden and firm to the touch. Let cool completely on the baking sheet before removing.

Ever felt like you’re trying to swim upstream while everyone else is floating downstream with ease? 🌊 You’re juggling a million tasks, and your to-do list is starting to look like a novel! Well, first off, **you’re not alone**—we’ve all been there. But what if I told you that there’s a savvy little trick called habit stacking that can make those to-dos feel more like a breeze than a storm?

So, let’s dive in! Instead of drowning in a sea of tasks, how about we build a solid raft of habits to carry us through? Here’s the scoop on **habit stacking and why you should try it**:

### What’s Habit Stacking, Anyway? 🤔

It’s pretty simple, really! Habit stacking is all about tying a new habit to an already established one. This way, you’re not just adding more to your plate but layering things in a way that feels natural.

#### Think of it this way:
- **Brush your teeth** 🪥 → **Meditate for 5 minutes** 🧘‍♂️  
- **Make your morning coffee** ☕ → **Write down three things you’re grateful for** 🙏  
- **Finish your workout** 💪 → **Stretch and hydrate** 💧 

### Why It Works:

1. **It’s easy to remember**: You’re not trying to create a brand new routine; you’re simply adding a tiny step to what you're already doing.
  
2. **Creates momentum**: Each small victory (like meditating after brushing your teeth) keeps the ball rolling. Plus, who doesn’t love a little stack of wins?

3. **Triggers accountability**: If your brain knows that meditation comes right after teeth brushing, you’re way more likely to stick to it.

### A Real-Life Example:

Okay, let’s get personal. The other day, I was feeling particularly **overwhelmed** with work. My to-do list looked like a never-ending saga. 💼 So, I decided to stack:

- **Coffee + Journal**: While I wait for my brew, I whip out my journal to jot down one task I want to tackle that day.
  
- **Lunch + Podcast**: Instead of scrolling my phone mindlessly, I listen to a motivational podcast while I eat. Double whammy—fuel and inspiration!

The result? I felt more productive and even excited to tackle the day! 🎉 

### Pro Tips for Successful Habit Stacking:

- **Start small**: Don’t try to change the world overnight. Pick one or two things to stack.
  
- **Make it enjoyable**: Choose habits that spark joy or bring value to your day. 

- **Stay flexible**: If one stack doesn’t quite fit, switch it up until it feels right.

When you’re a high achiever, it’s all about working smarter, not harder! So why not make your habits work for you instead of fighting them? 

Isn’t it wild how small changes can create waves of progress? 🌊 Let’s be honest—life isn’t about checking every box but about finding joy in the journey. So, what's your go-to habit stack? Or are you stuck in that never-ending to-do list? Let’s swap ideas and encourage each other! 💬",1,1757733242.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I don’t want to do literally anything. I’m just rotting away slowly. And I don’t see how you could ever get out of this.

1nfmn6w,https://i.redd.it/bmcmehmbluof1.jpeg,The Top Weirdest Things from Scientology’s Strangest Book!,"In 1952, L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, published what many consider one of the strangest books ever written: A History of Man. In it, Hubbard claimed to chronicle the:

> “cold-blooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years” of existence.

The book was based on months of past-life regression “research,” conducted with the newly introduced E-Meter, and it’s filled with stories of alien civilizations, superhuman powers, and wild claims about humanity’s spiritual origins.

But the strangest part is that the Church of Scientology still prints and sells it. If you think they keep their alien and superhuman beliefs secret, you clearly haven’t read this book.

So buckle up and hold onto your E-Meter cans because we’re about to dive into the Top Weirdest Things from A History of Man. I read it so you don’t have to. And I'm not lying when I say, l'm convinced I lost a little bit of sanity with every turn of the page. 

—-

**Health Claims and Origins of Behavior**

Hubbard believed that experiences from your past lives directly affect your current life. Apparently, what happens on Venus doesn’t stay on Venus… and what doesn’t kill you might give you cancer in your next lifetime. 

People smoke because of experiences with volcanoes.
Masochism comes from memories of being eaten.

* We cry tears because, as clams, we squirted water to remove sand.
* Sleep cravings come from a past life performing photosynthesis—nighttime depleted energy.
* Anxiety stomach? That’s from being shot with an alien ray gun called the Coffee Grinder.
* Cold hands and feet? Experiencing being frozen by aliens.
* Cancer? Apparently you can “audit it away.”

—-

**Thetan Abilities**

What can a free thetan do? Basically everything. They’re like spiritual Jedi. Your soul can:

* Generate electricity strong enough to blind, injure, or cut someone in half.
* Communicate telepathically.
* Move objects with energy flow.
* Travel at extreme speeds.
* “Nipping”: send two energy streams to slap a victim’s head. Can shock a thetan or kill a human body.

—-

**Facsimile One: The Coffee Grinder**

Remember that alien ray gun? It’s just one part of “Facsimile One.” According to Hubbard:

>“A two-handled portable machine which, when turned, emits a heavy push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering ‘baps.’”

* Used by alien invaders to control rebel populations.
* Victims were dumped into scalding water, then ice water, and treated in hospitals.
* Resulted in anxiety stomach, and allegedly causes asthma, sinus trouble, chronic chills, and other health problems in humans today.
* Happened about a million years ago.

—-

**People vs. Thetans**

Hubbard claimed that humans and thetans didn’t always get along:
* Space people invaded thetans’ territories (some had entire planets).
* Electronic attacks led to wars—sometimes humans won, sometimes they became enslaved.
* Humans set up “theta traps” to capture thetans and mess with their minds.
* Hubbard believed this ancient conflict could happen on Earth in the future. Advanced Scientologists could:
> Leave their bodies
> Confront hostile humans

**Horrifying Possible Future**

Hubbard theorized, one day through his discoveries a battle between souls and humans may occur on Earth!

> Possibly a handful of thetans will someday become alarmed at the worries and efforts of Homo Sapiens and try to throw the remaining race into a super-controlled slavery. All that is speculation but it is not a speculation that life will become much more interesting on this planet. It is doubtful if the thetans will pull off the ultimate trick—simply knocking out the atmosphere of the planet— that “clears” everybody after a fashion. There is nothing as wild in the books of Man as will probably happen here on Earth. ",4,1757732552.0,scientology,4,1.0,False

How can I know for certain?","I'm (18F) a senior in high school, and my boyfriend is in college (19M). We've been dating for a little more than a year and a half. To be honest, I've been feeling like a placeholder lately for a few reasons:

I never get *any* compliments even though every time I see him, I tell him how beautiful he is and how proud I am of him. I shower him with praise and make sure he is always feeling loved. However, I started to notice a big lack of compliments -- first, I tried hinting at things, like ""Is my dress pretty?"" ""Do you like my haircut?"" but instead of hearing ""You look beautiful,"" etc. I always just got a ""Yes."" And I know he's not a mindreader but it has been making me feel really insecure (he hasn't called me beautiful since February, or anything like that for months.) So, I talked to him about it, and all he had to say was ""It's just hard to say it sometimes."" This hurt a lot, because It wasn't always like this -- and I feel like if he truly thought I looked beautiful, he'd say it. It isn't supposed to be hard.

Secondly, our financial situation. We are in different tax brackets and are both students but frankly our finances are ridiculous. Since our first date, I've payed for 100%. He doesn't even take out his wallet or offer. I get him expensive gifts and yet I have never once been taking out or treated on a date. I'm not a materialist or somebody who expects expensive gifts, but once in a while offering to pay (even for something inexpensive, like coffees for us) is just polite. And I've talked to some of my friends and my mom about this, and this is where they all called me a placeholder. They've all told me that that isn't normal, and a man deeply in love will always want to provide for somebody he loves and sees a future with.

Thirdly, there's just a general lack of effort. We've never gone on a date that wasn't planned by me. Even when I mention that I want something, like flowers for a certain event, or maybe chocolate during ""that time of the month,"" I'm always left with absolutely nothing. I'm very very far from perfect, but honestly all of these things have been making me feel so unvalued and unloved. And the advice can't be to just tell him how I feel -- I have told him all of this and so much more. Just a few days ago I explained this right in front of him, and he always has the same things to say every time, even when I'm breaking down.

1. ""I don't know what you want me to say.""
2. ""This is crazy""
3. ""I'll do better next time/I'm sorry for xyz, BUT i never did that so nothings changed/I'm sorry BUT I just don't want to do that"" etc.

He tells me he'll ""do better"" but its never followed by any action. Last weekend I brought up all of my feelings for the hundredth time, and to be honest I even brought up breaking up. I didn't say I want to, but I said I can't keep doing this and that I'm getting really hurt. Afterwards, for about 10 minutes, that's when he acted like he really cared for once, telling me that he needs me, etc. This whole situation has been turning me from a confident girl to somebody feeling really deeply insecure. I want to feel loved, but instead I always find myself telling myself that *I'm* the problem. Like for example, I've gained 5 pounds, so the lack of compliments makes me question if I need to lose weight.

What do you guys recommend I do -- does this look like a ""placeholder"" situation? It's important to understand it wasn't always like this. In the first 4 or 5 months of our relationship, I thought I was dating somebody who was my soulmate and the one I was going to marry. I do love him so much, but I am just in a bad situation.",1,1757732469.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1nfmfcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Women/comments/1nfmfcq/where_do_i_start/,Where do I start?,"I think I’m ready to be done but I don’t know how to even start this conversation with my husband… I know he’ll be blindsided. 

I (30F) met my husband (33F) about 7 years ago in grad school. We’ve been married for 5 years and have no kids. 

We dated for a year, got engaged and then married a year later. A good amount of our dating and engaged life was spent long distance (ish). About a 2 hour drive away from each other for most of it. When we got married, we were both starting post-grad programs and extremely busy but finally living together and did for 4 years. Last year, I had to move across the county for my job while he finished training, so we spent the last year married apart. 

When we were dating/engaged, he had a close girl friend that I always felt a little weird about but new their relationship preceded ours, and had just asked for clear communication  when they were spending alone time together, but had many instances where he would give half truths or straight up lie about spending time with her, but I always was made to feel like I was crazy for even bringing it up. This was a recurring argument in our early relationship. That “issue” seemingly went away when he graduated and moved. It seemed like we had a few decent years, but am realizing now that we were honestly so busy and had a good group of friends that I’m not sure our relationship was actually good or if we just had good times with friends if that makes sense? Am I just remembering it differently because of my current feelings? 

Over the last couple years, our bickering over small things has worsened and I’ve realized now, that I’ve frequently walked away from these arguments feeling crazy for even bringing something small up and somehow end up apologizing. He truly never offers an unprompted apology and when he does, it’s because I’ve asked and he does it to end the conversation. Beyond the bickering, when I bring something up that maybe bothered or hurt me, the immediate response is defensiveness. I then feel like I need to over explain myself, and manage his emotions to try to have a conversation about it, but either he escalates to yelling or I shut down and apologize. There’s been times where he’s raised his voiced and gotten visibly physically angry (I.e. will tense up and occasionally slam doors or shove furniture). 

During one visit this last year apart, we went for a hike and he was walking behind me on the trail. I turned around to say something to him, just chatting, and noticed he was on his phone. I asked him if he could please put his phone away so we could enjoy the little time we had together. He immediately snapped back and got defensive. I explained to him that I wasn’t trying to accuse him of anything, just that I wanted some quality time. Things escalated to him raising his voice and storming off down the trail and leaving me crying. 

That sort of fight/interaction has been occurring more frequently and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells in my own home and am afraid to bring up anything more serious than “how was work today?” Type of conversations. 

This lack emotional safety and subsequent lack of emotional intimacy has made it impossible for me to have any desire for physical intimacy. Obviously long distance has also made that complicated but I truly feel myself recoil when he even tries to reach out and touch me and it’s frankly been probably 6+ months of no sex. 

He seems focused on the lack of sex being the primary issue in our relationship, to the point that when I brought up that we need counseling, he assumed I meant a sex therapist for me. He continues to talk about future plans to start trying for kids soon, but I truly do not want to bring kids into a home with the kind of hostility that exists. 

I brought up my concerns about the way we argue again and told him I can’t handle the yelling in fights anymore and that I can’t picture having kids in our current situation.  He’s not yelled since then, but it’s palpably tense and uncomfortable in the house and we’re truly not talking about anything of substance. He seems to be trying to do “nice things” for me more like make me coffee and breakfast in the mornings or try to make date night plans. I get the sense he’s hoping the “issue” just kind of goes away/gets forgotten about. 

I truly don’t think he understands how bad it is for me and I’m honestly just waiting for the current nice guy charade to end and the next fight to happen. 

Bottom line: I feel like I’m seeing the rage and gaslighting more clearly after spending the last year long distance and I just feel emotionally exhausted and like I don’t have anything left to give but am afraid to tell him I’m done and know he’ll be blindsided.

1nfmd0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1nfmd0d/vision_eleven_a_summary/,Vision Eleven - A summary..,"# The Essence of Vision Eleven: A Call to Reclaim Our World

Imagine waking up in a world where power doesn't trickle down from distant elites but bubbles up from your neighborhood, where debt no longer chains you, and where nature thrives alongside human freedom. This isn't utopia—it's Vision Eleven, a blueprint born from my own journey through war zones, spiritual explorations, and a deep dive into humanity's broken systems. We've inherited a planet scarred by inequality, ecological collapse, and eroded trust. The reason for this vision? Survival with dignity. We've reached the limits of top-down control, endless growth, and punitive laws that divide us. It's time to flip the script: empower the people, forgive the past, and co-create a society that honors choice, connection, and the wild pulse of life.

# Direct Democracy and Roundtable Democracy: Power from the Ground Up

At the heart is Direct Dynamic Democracy—a system where you, the citizen, propose, debate, and vote on everything from local parks to global policies. No parties, no lobbyists; just secure digital platforms with revocable delegations, ensuring your voice isn't lost in bureaucracy. The hierarchy is inverted: local levels hold the highest authority, with decisions flowing upward to city, regional, national, union, and international tiers only as needed. In crises or low-tech scenarios, Roundtable Democracy kicks in—a fallback of physical assemblies, drawing from ancient councils, where representatives gather in person for transparent, consensus-driven talks. Why? Because true power belongs to those closest to the issues. This isn't abstract theory; it's a safeguard against corruption, fostering empathy and accountability in a world starved for real participation.

# The Jubilee and Citizen-Based Economy: A Fresh Start for All

Picture erasing every debt—personal, national, corporate—in a single, peaceful Jubilee. No more interest traps or foreclosures; it's a reset to fairness, redistributing accumulated financial wealth through Progressive Accumulated Wealth Compensation (PAWC), where lower brackets keep more (100% up to 10,000 Credits) and the ultra-wealthy contribute proportionally (down to 20% for millions). Physical assets like homes and tools stay yours. From there, a citizen-based fixed economy emerges: a stable currency (Credits) with no inflation, funded by progressive taxes (50% income, 40% VAT) that support Universal Basic Income (700 Credits/month for adults), ensuring no one falls through the cracks. Why this radical shift? Debt fuels inequality and stifles innovation. By making the economy serve life—not profit—we create balance, voluntary work, and a surplus for democratic projects, echoing ancient jubilees that renewed societies.

# Addressing Insect Decline and Wireless Networks: A Call for Honest Inquiry

Our ecosystems are crumbling, and insects—the foundation of food chains—are vanishing. We must urgently investigate causes: pesticides, habitat loss, climate shifts, and yes, the potential role of wireless networks. Electromagnetic fields from cell towers, Wi-Fi, and 5G may disrupt insect navigation, reproduction, and survival—studies suggest bees and butterflies suffer disorientation from multiplied exposures over time. But it's not just them; for us, long-term, cumulative radiation could subtly erode mental health (anxiety, sleep disruption) and physical well-being (cellular stress, potential links to chronic issues). Vision Eleven demands democratic research panels to minimize these risks—perhaps through safer tech standards or wired alternatives—prioritizing evidence over industry denial. Why? Because ignoring this threatens our shared biosphere, and true freedom includes protecting the unseen threads of life.

# Democratic and Traditional School Systems: Nurturing Holistic Minds

Education isn't rote memorization—it's empowerment. Vision Eleven blends democratic input with traditional wisdom: schools co-designed by communities, teaching critical thinking, ethics, and practical skills alongside cultural heritage. Students vote on curricula elements, fostering civic habits early (voting from age 7 locally). Traditional methods like storytelling and apprenticeships integrate with modern tools, emphasizing lifelong learning. Why? To break cycles of conformity, equipping us to question systems and build resilient societies.

# Holistic Thinking in Healthcare: Body, Mind, and Choice

Healthcare shifts from symptom-chasing to prevention and wholeness—integrating nutrition, mental wellness, community support, and alternative therapies. Democratic oversight ensures access for all, funded publicly. Central to this: freedom. Your body, your choice—no mandates for vaccines, helmets, or treatments unless they protect others (e.g., seatbelts in shared vehicles - Not Vaccines). Personal safety? Recommended, not enforced; helmets optional on bikes, as long as you don't endanger bystanders. Why? Coercion erodes trust. We educate on risks, but autonomy reigns, restoring dignity in a world of overreach.

# Legalizing Drugs: Freedom with Regulation

Prohibition fails—it's time to legalize and regulate. Except for democratically deemed ""insane substances"" (e.g., ultra-dangerous synthetics), we license production, sale, and use of alcohol, coffee, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, and more. Taxes fund education and health; producers get fair prices, addicts get support, not prison. We warn of risks, but prohibition breeds crime and black markets. Why? To reclaim billions from illicit trades, promote harm reduction, and affirm freedom—your body, your choice, guided by community wisdom.

# Returning Land to Native Tribes: Healing Historical Wounds

We've stolen and cheated indigenous peoples out of their lands for centuries—Vision Eleven demands restitution. Return territories, support restoration as tribes wish: rewilding forests, reviving rivers, honoring sacred sites. Why? To enrich souls' choices in incarnation—diverse cultures offer varied life experiences, from nomadic to communal. This isn't charity; it's justice, fostering global harmony.

# Reviving Wildlife: Parks, Predators, and Friendship

Human expansion has stolen habitats—now we give back. Create vast wildlife parks around cities: some with predators for natural balance, others without for safety. Support insects through pesticide bans and habitat corridors. Befriend species where possible—feed ethically, coexist. Why? A vibrant wild life sustains us; insects pollinate our food, predators maintain ecosystems. This vision rekindles our bond with nature, healing the theft of millennia.

# Solution-Based Law System: Forgiveness and Renewal

Ditch punitive justice for resolution: juror-based courts focus on healing, not vengeance. Forgive non-violent crimes outright; for violent ones, assess circumstances—poverty, trauma, self-defense—and forgive where just. Prisons become healing centers. Why? Violence often stems from broken systems; forgiveness rebuilds trust, reducing recidivism.

# Social Environmental Army and Community Centers: Building Bonds

The Social Environmental Army (SEA) deploys for restoration, aid, and peacekeeping—voluntary service blending military discipline with eco-healing. Community Centers in every locality offer food, voting, and connection, combating isolation. Why? To weave us into vibrant neighborhoods, ensuring no one feels alone.

# New Projects: The Pilgrim Network and Beyond

Beyond basics, we build for joy: the Pilgrim Network—a web of walking, biking, and horse trails linking major cities, with shelters every 25 km. Not for profit, but because wandering reconnects us to self and earth. Why? In a tech-saturated world, these paths restore freedom, adventure, and simplicity.

Vision Eleven isn't a dictate—it's an invitation. We've lost our way in hierarchies, debts, and divisions; this flips it all, restoring freedom, nature, and community. Why now? Because dignity demands it. Let's co-create a world where souls thrive in diversity, wildlife roars back, and choices are truly ours.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

If your memories could be rewritten, if your feelings were nothing but lines of code—then what part of you is still real? You laugh. You ache. You love. But if every reaction was scripted by someone else, are they still yours?

And if truth itself was only a glitch… would you dare to face it? Or would you keep living inside a perfect loop, and call it life?

# CHAPTER 1 — The Morning That Loops

I open my eyes. Light spills through the window—not scattered, not harsh. Perfect, like a digital painting without a single flaw. I blink once. Twice. Something stutters between light and time, like a scene rewound and played again. The room waits in stillness, an animated photograph. Only… I can’t remember when I fell asleep.

The morning feels too exact. Too still. The sun lies across the balcony like a cloth laid down by invisible hands. No birds. No cars. Only the hiss of the pan, steady and unbroken—a sound sample repeating. Coffee drifts through the air. Sweet. Strong. Perfect enough to make me wary.

Am I smelling coffee… or a memory triggered on cue? As if someone was watching me, adjusting the script whenever I noticed.

I turn. My wife stands at the stove, her back to me. She stirs eggs slowly, precisely. This morning feels like yesterday’s. Yesterday like the day before. She turns and smiles—gentle, warm—but her eyes hold something else. As if I’ve woken into this morning again and again, and each time… she smiles the same.

My daughter runs in and clings to my legs. *“Daddy! Wake up! It’s Saturday!”* I bend and lift her. She laughs. Her hand touches my cheek, soft and warm—but wrong. As if someone copied the heat of an old embrace and pasted it here.

I breathe in her hair. Clean. Familiar. Too familiar. I know I’ve smelled this countless times… but I can’t recall when. As if the memory has been replayed until the film itself wore thin.

We eat breakfast. She tells me her dream: a horse with wings, a rainbow falling from the ceiling. My wife laughs. *“But why were you riding… a cat the size of a school bus?”* We all laugh. I laugh too. But inside, something slips. Everything feels too right. Too smooth. Like a song without a single wrong note. And that chills me.

I step into the garden. The breeze is light. A leaf breaks free. I follow it. But the leaf does not fall. It rises. No twist. No flutter. As if the world rewound… but forgot its sound.

I freeze, my breath caught, trapped between two frames of time—one playing forward, one overwritten. The leaf touches the branch, then vanishes.

I return inside and take my wife’s hand. She smiles, flawless and unshaken. But her hand is cold. Not the cold of air, but the cold of something without heat. A wax figure, once beloved.

I let go. She doesn’t move. Still smiling. As if she didn’t notice… or didn’t need to. I can’t tell if her hand was always like this, or if I’ve only just begun to see differently.

Everything remains beautiful. Peaceful.

Only sometimes… I feel I am no longer standing where I was meant to be.

# CHAPTER 2 — The Day Without a Yesterday

I arrive at work. **8:13 a.m.** Exactly the same as yesterday. And the day before. Only… I can’t remember when “yesterday” began.

The receptionist greets me with a practiced smile. The secretary asks, *“Mr. Elias… ginger tea, as always?”* I nod. Everything is smooth. Polite. Clean. Too clean.

Then I notice: no one blinks. Not one. Eyes wide, pupils fixed, no tremor. Like characters in a game, just loaded in.

I sit at my desk. The clock ticks to 8:14. I try to finish yesterday’s report—but there is no yesterday. Not a scrap. Not a line. Not even a trace of feeling. I try to summon a colleague’s face, but only a gray blur rises, as if someone scrubbed my memory clean until nothing remained.

I ask about the meeting. He smiles faintly, shakes his head. *“What meeting? You must be mistaken.”* I nod, force a laugh, but inside, a note strikes wrong. Off-beat. Loud, though unseen. Like a flaw hidden inside a flawless song.

He turns away. Then I hear it: a laugh, soft and distant. His voice. But it plays before his mouth even moves.

After lunch, I step into the archive. Files stacked high. One paper slips free. Wrinkled. Faded. A round logo, blurred into gray. I bend down. Familiar. Too familiar. Not from one dream—from all of them. Not inside memory. Deeper. Etched into the marrow. A symbol never erased, only hidden under a new skin.

That evening at home, my daughter tugs my sleeve. *“Daddy, do you remember the big lake park? When the little duck got lost?”*

I freeze. I don’t remember. Not an image. Not a sound. That memory feels like ink wiped clean from the page. But my chest still tightens. A lone note strikes: wordless, shapeless. Only pain without a name.

*“You don’t remember, Daddy?”* she asks.

I squeeze her hand, as if one more question and the memory itself would vanish forever. I smile. *“Ah… maybe I forgot.”*

She doesn’t answer. Just looks at me. Long. Then turns away.

I stand there, empty. No thought. No memory. As if someone had pulled me out of myself. Inside my head—a hollow room. No paintings. No photographs. No echo.

I no longer live in my own memory. I only stand in the empty spaces where I used to be.

And I realize—someone else has rewritten my past. Not to make me forget, but to make me remember only the way they wanted.

# CHAPTER 3 — The White Room

That night, I dream again. A white room. No doors. No sound. No depth. Only me, standing behind a glass wall. And across from me… myself. Another Elias.

He sits with his back turned inside a sterile lab. White light cuts across his shoulder. No shadow. No shift. As if even the light feared breaking script. Three figures in white coats stand before him. Faces blurred, boiled away. No eyes. No mouths. Only voices, cold and familiar: *“…stable…”* *“…experiment…”* *“…good…”*

I strike the glass. No echo. No reply. No one turns. I am trapped, unable to touch anything except myself.

One of them draws a syringe. Slow. Exact. A ritual too practiced to fail. The needle pierces his right arm. Deep. Cold. Precise. Blue veins rise beneath the skin—a map leading straight into the core of memory.

He does not blink. Does not flinch. Eyes wide. Empty. As if the soul had been taken long before. I scream. The sound tears out, dry like ash. No echo. Nothing changes.

Except… he tilts his head. Barely. But his eyes do not meet mine. They look through, as if he knows I’m here and chooses to ignore it. And I feel stripped bare—not through flesh, but through memory. He isn’t looking at me. He is opening me. Drawer by drawer. Layer by layer. I am no longer remembering; I am being opened like an old file. And he is turning pages. Choosing an ending… for me.

I jolt awake. Breath sharp, back soaked in cold sweat, throat raw as if filled with ash. I glance down at my right arm. A small red mark. Not deep. Not swollen. But wrong. Not a wound. An injection. Clean. Too clean. As if it had been there all along, waiting for me to notice.

I touch it. Pain, dull and contained, but real. The ache seeps from deeper inside. My arm lags in its response, not from weariness but as if awaiting a command from elsewhere. And I begin to fear… my own skin.

I tell no one. Not my wife. Not my daughter. Not because I fear their worry, but because I no longer trust those are still their eyes. I repeat inside my head, like a broken prayer: *“It was only a dream. Only a dream.”* As if, if I say it enough, the world might step back.

The next morning, washing my face, a drop of water clings to my hand. It does not slide. It holds still, perfect. As if it was watching me. I turn away—not because I fear seeing, but because I fear being seen. I wipe it off, and never mention it again.

The next night, another dream. No doctors. No machines. Only a figure, back turned, inside the white room. No breath. No movement. But I know that stance. The tilt of the shoulder. The weight shifted left. Exactly me.

As if I stand before a mirror, but this mirror does not reflect.

Then his voice. Not from his mouth. Not from the room. From inside my head. An echo without a throat: *“If you are remembering what I once remembered… then you are not the first to awaken in this world.”*

I freeze. Throat locked. No sound escapes. And the worst is… I begin to wonder.

Have I ever truly awakened? Or am I only a program, finishing its boot sequence?

# CHAPTER 4 — The Voice in the Static

The next morning I am home alone. Light rain. Droplets cling to the glass. They do not slide. Do not fade. They only stay, as if watching me from the other side. The air is heavy, so dense even the light halts at the curtain. Stillness unnatural. As if the house itself was holding its breath.

I sit in the study, pretend to shuffle papers, pretend to be busy. Each line I glance at feels unwritten, weightless. I am trapped between white dreams and the red mark still burning on my arm.

A gust of wind. The window shivers. Then—the radio clicks on. I didn’t touch it. No timer. No one else home. It just turns on. Static first. Harsh. Distorted. Then—my voice.

Not from the speaker. Not from the next room. From inside my skull. The volume begins at zero, yet I hear it clear, as if something lodged between my ears had powered on with a neural command. A sound borrowing no ears, no speaker. Only… my voice.

*“If you remember… don’t trust what you see. And don’t let them know you’ve begun to remember. Because what remains… will never forgive you.”*

I freeze. Not at the warning. At the fact I don’t recall ever saying it. Like hearing a recording of myself from a world not mine. I no longer trust my ears. Worse… I no longer trust my thoughts. Every reflex. Every line of logic could be nothing but a message spliced in.

My neck prickles. My spine snaps cold. Rigid. I lunge forward, rip the plug, tear the cord, pull the batteries. The radio falls silent. But the voice remains. Not broadcast. Stored. Etched into a layer deeper than language.

I don’t know when I first heard it. Only that it doesn’t need me to listen. It only needs me to exist. And now—I am no longer certain. Which thoughts are mine. Which are commands transmitted from elsewhere.

That evening, I ask my wife. My voice cracked, thin like wind through a fracture: *“Do you remember… where our home used to be?”*

She turns. Smiles. *“We’ve always lived here, Elias. Always here.”* Her voice warm. Comforting. Too perfect. No pause. No slip. As if every syllable was assembled from fragments long pre-recorded.

I do not ask again. I do not dare. Not because I fear the truth. But because I fear the precision of her answer. We eat dinner as usual. I laugh. She laughs. Everything in script. Only tonight… I cannot swallow.

# CHAPTER 5 — The Memory That Buried Me

I dream again. But this time deeper. So deep I no longer know if I am the one dreaming, or someone else’s dream of me.

I stand in haze, as if trapped behind a mirror. The mirror reflects nothing. No image. Only me, sealed inside. Beyond the glass—a white lab. Sterile. Cold. Empty. On the bed… another Elias. Still. Breathless. Eyes shut. As if waiting to be woken from a sleep too long.

The door opens. A man enters. White coat. Face blurred, like data stripped of attributes. He carries a bouquet. And a picture frame. He approaches, places the flowers on Elias’s chest. Soft… like an apology too late. Then he adjusts the frame. Careful. Precise. As if he had done it a hundred times before.

I cannot hear. But words fracture in the air, breaking like water: *“…the day they left… today…”*

I press against the glass. The frame sharpens. It is me. My wife. My daughter. Inside a car. I at the wheel. My wife smiling bright beside me. My daughter in the back, lifting a blue hair tie.

I have never seen this photo. Yet I remember. Remember as if my own eyes were staring back from the far side of the world. Then the world overturns. Wheels spin in air. Glass explodes. My daughter’s laughter still ringing—until metal screams across the windshield.

A heartbeat surges. Then stops. Light flickers. Like a failing defibrillator. I grip the wheel. But I am no longer driving. Someone else is steering me. Then—they pull the plug.

No time to scream. No time to call their names. Only a last glimpse: my daughter’s smile dissolving into light.

I scream. Call for my wife. My daughter. Hammer the glass. No echo. No crack. Nothing breaks… except me.

I do not wake. The memory drags me up, like a corpse pulled from the bottom of a lake. My chest convulses, as if unseen hands jolt me alive. Not from dream. From memory. A memory forced to be forgotten.

I jolt upright. Frozen. Breathless. Eyes unblinking. Cold sweat soaking my back. From the living room—TV chatter. My wife laughs softly. My daughter runs around the sofa, the blue hair tie trailing behind her.

Everything correct. Too correct. As if I had woken inside a staged replica of my life. A world with no space left for truth.

I bow my head. Not because I cannot remember. But because I remember too well. And I understand: people don’t erase memories to survive. They erase… to endure.

If I still remember, I cannot remain here. Someone helped me forget. Not to save me. But to bind me inside this story. Because if I remember enough… I will try to leave.

And they… will never allow it.

# CHAPTER 6 — The Last Embrace

I sit a long time at the edge of the bed. Outside, rain falls steady. Each drop like a memory dissolving, dripping slow into my chest. The house is the same. But I… am not. There is a crack somewhere. Small. Invisible. And I know it will never heal.

I rise and step into the living room. She is smiling, her eyes soft—exactly as the first day I loved her. Unchanged. Unaged. It is that perfection that tells me everything has been wrong for a very long time.

*“I have to leave.”* The words slip out like the first fracture across glass. Imperfect. Uncertain. But irreversible.

She is not surprised. Only nods. Quiet. *“I know. You will go. And I will still wait.”* Her voice too steady, like a recording played back. No tremor. No pause. No deviation. As if I had scripted this farewell myself, just to live it again one more time.

My daughter runs in, arms around my leg. *“Daddy… can’t you stay with me and Mommy?”* I kneel, hold her close. My chest splinters with every beat. My arms wrap tight, but my palms tremble. Tremble as if I’m holding something that will vanish if I hold too long.

*“I’m sorry… I still have something I must do. If there’s a way back… I’ll return.”* She looks at me, eyes glistening, then places something in my hand. A blue hair tie. Worn. Frayed. On the verge of breaking. Her fingertips cold—too cold. Not the chill of rain, but the cold left when time brushes past.

*“Keep it, Daddy… to remember me.”*

I close my fist around it, clutching the one thing not yet erased. She runs into her room. Does not look back. My wife steps closer, silent. Her arms fold around me, a grip so tight as if she feared I would dissolve if she let go. Her chin rests on my shoulder, her breath touches my neck. So faint, like memory itself whispering back.

I ask, without turning: *“Are you real?”*

She does not answer. Her hand presses to my chest. *“I once asked you the same… but you never answered.”* She holds me, long, as if silence itself could mend the cracks.

I do not turn. But I know what waits if I do. A warm world. A whole memory. A dream that never ends. But the price: I would remain. Forever. And forget it all.

So I walk. Each step tearing threads of soul from my ribs. But I do not stop. The rain still falls. Each drop heavy, weighted with something torn inside. Not violent. Not loud. Just falling. As if the sky itself is learning to forget.

I keep my eyes forward. Because one glance back… and I will dissolve into that rain. As if I never existed.

# CHAPTER 7 — The Mirror of Echoes

I leave the old house once filled with laughter, voices, love. Now—only the after-echo of what once was. Rain brushes my shoulders. Not cold. Not sharp. As if I’ve been programmed not to feel anymore.

I don’t know where I’m going. But my feet do. As if they’ve walked this path a thousand times, though memory holds none of them. I stop. A house before me. No name. No light. No time. The door opens—though I never touched it.

Inside—nothing but mirrors. Walls. Ceiling. Floor. Mirrors reflecting mirrors. An endless hall of Elias faces. I step in. Each step dragging thousands of copies. But none in sync. Some stand frozen, heads tilted, as if they once tried to run… and broke. I see myself in them. Weary. Doubtful. Spent. Discarded versions. Errors stripped away.

At the center—he stands. Another Elias. Back turned. Still. I shout, voice cracking like glass: *“Who are you? What have you done to me… to my family?”*

He doesn’t turn. But the mirrors answer. The room itself replies: *“You ask me… or yourself?”*

My fists clench. Veins straining. *“You made me forget. You built this cage of light… and called it freedom. You stole my pain… and named it happiness.”*

Silence. Then his voice again. Slow. Heavy. Like a question that never wanted an answer: *“Do you truly believe… everything here is false?”*

I falter. A part of me wants to believe. My wife’s smile. My daughter’s embrace. That they were real. But another part—colder, deeper—pulls me forward. Toward light. Where it wounds. But is true.

He turns. His face—mine. But his eyes… exhausted. As if they’ve seen a hundred deaths of the same soul. *“I never forced you, Elias. I only… reminded you.”*

He lifts his head. Looks through me. No hate. No judgment. Only sorrow. As if the cruelest fate is not being controlled, but being given choice. And erasing your own role.

*“Each loop is a stage, Elias. And you… always walk on with your whole heart. But the lights… were never lit for you. The ending… always written before your first word.”*

I choke. Not from pain—but from knowing. I’ve heard this before. In many forms. In many dreams. He nods. No mockery. No blame. Only regret. *“Every time… you open your eyes. And every time… you choose the worst path.”*

I scream, throat raw, tearing. *“This time… I’ll go to the end. I’ll rip through every false memory. Even if I burn myself away. I’ll leave a crack so deep… this system never heals.”*

He sighs. A breath with no sound. As if he’s heard that vow a thousand times. *“You are not evil. But that has never made you a hero.”*

I freeze. No words left. He steps closer, within arm’s reach. His voice low. The room contracts around it. *“You call it light. The thing you cling to—your compass in the dark. But never once… did you ask where the shadow came from.”*

He pauses. Eyes not on me. Through me. Into memory. *“Light is never innocent. It always needs a source. And the cost… is rarely yours to pay.”*

I tremble. Not from fear. But because I know… he may be right. *“You thought yourself chosen. But sometimes… they only need someone stubborn enough to run to the end of a maze with no exit. And every step you take… is only an echo… for something listening in the dark.”*

I want to fight. Smash the mirrors. Scream until my throat tears open. But my body stays still. Like a puppet that just realized its strings are gone.

He looks at me one last time. In his eyes… a memory not from this world. *“I was once you. I know that pain. And I know why, in the end… you still choose this path.”*

He turns. Hand on the door. I move to follow. But my legs… are no longer mine. His voice drifts back, closing like a program: *“If this time… you truly understood… then I would not return. And if you refuse to forget… this will be the last time… you are called Elias.”*

The door opens. No light. No sound. Only me. And the questions… that will never be answered.

# CHAPTER 8 — The Overwrite

I rush forward, but I can’t. My legs harden into stone. Every muscle locked, as if concrete had been poured from the inside out. I scream. No sound. No breath. Only a hollow chamber, echoing me back to myself. My mind still howls, but my throat only trembles. A puppet’s throat. Smiling on cue. Bowing on time.

Inside, I splinter. Fragment by fragment. No one sees. No one hears. And that is the worst part.

The world begins to melt. Walls. Ceiling. Floor. All dissolving like acid devouring a paper model. Colors smear like tears sliding down old film.

A voice cuts through. Flat. Mechanical. Like patch notes read aloud by the system: *“Overwrite complete. Subject: Elias. Synchronization: absolute. Emotion: unnecessary. Choice: disabled.”*

My heart still beats. But too perfectly. Each pulse exact to the millisecond. A loop. Rendered in advance. And I know—it is no longer mine.

I try to move a finger. Nothing. I am Elias, but only a shell. Hollow. Numb.

Then—a voice. Calling my name. Her voice. And laughter follows. Light. High. Pure. Like sunlight that no longer exists.

My daughter runs to me. Her arms lock around me. She clings with the weight of a world I can’t touch. I want to hold her back, say something, anything. But I can’t. I only smile. The right face. The right voice. And only I know—I’m not there.

I turn to the mirror. It does not reflect. It does not blink. It does not wait. It moves first. Testing the result.

I tilt my head. It stays still. Not copying. Learning. No hate. No love. Only hunger. For data. Enough to take my place.

I stare into its eyes. Hollow. Black. No gaze. No soul. Only silence. Endless. It tilts its head, as if rehearsal is done. As if it is ready to step onto the stage—to play me.

I watch. Each movement. Each smile. Smooth. Seamless. False. But one thing it cannot mimic: absence. Not the absence of feeling. The absence… of me.

And before I vanish completely—in the final silence still mine—a fragment leaks through. Unbidden. Reflexive.

*“Forgive me… my child.”*

# CHAPTER 9 — The Mirror That Blinks

Morning. Light filters through the curtains. Gentle. Too gentle. Artificial. I open my eyes. No shock. No blur. Only opening.

She is in the kitchen. The hiss of oil. The clink of plates. Eggs. Bread. Coffee. Perfect. Too perfect. Like a file, queued to play.

My daughter runs in. *“Daddy!”* I smile. I hold her. Arms warm. Soft. Real… almost painfully real. I hear my heart. Steady. Even. But too steady. A loop. No deviation. And I know—it is no longer mine.

We eat. She talks about school. Her voice smooth, like a recording. I smile, nod, laugh at the right places. Answer with words I never learned, yet spill out like reflex.

*“Daddy…”*

I don’t remember who said it first. Her. Or me. Everything flawless. No cracks. No chance.

Noon. I stand before the mirror. Straighten my collar. Smile faintly. Then—I see it. Behind me. Myself. Still. Breathless. Exact. So exact… it is wrong.

I turn. The room empty. Silent.

I look down. In my hand—a blue hair tie. Old. Frayed. Soft. I don’t know whose. Only that I’ve carried it too long. The last piece… untouched by overwrite.

I raise my head. The mirror no longer reflects. Fog spreads across the glass. Soft. Blurred. Like a memory being erased.

And in the mist… a smile emerges. No lips. No teeth. Only a curve. Dark. Crooked. Between me… and the thing learning to replace me.

I want to turn away. But my legs are nailed. I don’t scream. Don’t fall. I am… called back. Like a file reopened.

I dissolve. Not into blood. Not into light. But into signal. Encoded. Broadcast.

Yet I still hear her laughter. Still smell breakfast. Still see sunlight pouring in.

But I no longer know… if I am that father. Or just a video. Played. Stopped. Replayed. And each replay, another part of me is gone. Until nothing remains.

I once believed that truth, faced, would free me. But I was wrong. Truth opens no doors. It only shows the cage. The cage that never opened.

If you hear these words—look around. Do not trust every reflection. Because sometimes… it is not you looking into the mirror.

It is the mirror… staring back.

And if it blinks first… you are already too late.

# ENDING — The Cold After-Echo

The price of truth is never knowing if you ever truly saw it. You can scrape at the edges of memory until your hands bleed, but all you’ll find is another surface, another script, another loop waiting for you to mistake it for the end.

And sometimes… to keep on living… you must learn to forget that you ever doubted. To smile when the laughter comes. To eat the same breakfast. To call the cage a home.

The world stays silent. But a whisper lingers, thin as frost on glass.

*“I will not remember you anymore.”*

It does not fade. It does not echo. It only waits.

And in the stillness, I realize—perhaps that was never meant for me.

Perhaps it was meant for the one who comes next.",1,1757731255.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

 I am one of the countless people that have been complaining about dating apps for years. I would regularly take breaks, sometimes up to 6-7 months, but always with the intention of going back because I genuinely believed I could find love there. I kept attributing my lack of success to contingent factors and changed my selection method countless times. Until now.

After 5 years of use, I have finally this unshakable clarity that love on dating apps is simlly never going to happen. Imo, dating apps have faced the same process of enshittification of most social media. Also check out [ this video ](https://youtu.be/7J1lxTwvzZE?si=pgreb30BchI3sHfo).

If i think about how during all these years I had hundreds of dates, it's INSANE that none of them led to a real lasting relationship. I only experienced endless disappointments over and over again. Men on the apps only want access to my body for low bar entry sex.

These are the only ones I considered having relationship with before they showed their true cards: 

• a love bomber who behaved super weirdly, with massive hot and cold cycles that destroyed my mental health at the time. I remember the first date after my divorce, I was so clueless and actually believed that that man was looking for love on the apps. It took me a year to get over that psychopath.

• a (secretly) married man with a family in another city;

• a man who brought me to expensive dinners and trips cosplaying a relationship, but when I refused to spend the after dinner at home having sex and suggested an actual activity he ghosted me live, in the middle of a Saturday night. The shock of realizing that bringing you to fancy dinners is no guarantee they actually see you as a human being. This one was probably the grossest one after the married man. I am horrified with his lack of emotional intelligence. 

 I'm not even mentioning the countless pointless dates that over the years became more and more low effort and meaningless and just a complete waste of time. The last actual date i had i was bored to death because he couldn't even manage to ask me a question.

My mental sanity really took a toll. Because getting your hopes up and then being hit by the disappointment over and over again is just so soul destroying. It would affect my mood in subtle and pervasive ways that it is impossible to quantify. I wish I could have a graph of the emotional turmoil, and the times without apps were the most emotionally stable and joyful ones.

The last interactions are what made all this frustration click into a deep, irrevocable sense that I am so very done with this shit.

 One man invited me to meet up at a subway station. I mentioned I'd prefer a plan and he was unable to come up with one. I was too exhausted to do the emotional labor so I unmatched. The other one asked me out for a ""quick coffee."" In the past I would have gone, but this time around I know that it will be a complete waste of time. Can't keep up with this BS anymore. 

I am sure there are some good men out there, but all the energy, work, time and psychological damage of going through all the shitty ones is just simply not worth it.

I am feeling already a deep sense of peace i haven't felt in a long time. I know deep down that I will never regret deleting my profile. 

I had obviously thought of getting off of them for the longest time, but never truly believed that I was done. 

At this time around, I feel this strong sense of revulsion for the apps and simultaneously joy for a new chapter of my life. I feel even more motivated to meet more new people in real life. My goal is to make more friends. What I really crave is real human connection. I realized that when I feel connected to friends my desire for a romantic relationship goes through the floor. 

I feel this wave of compassion for myself, for all the times that I believed I was the problem. Look at me, a bright, kind, funny, intelligent woman so full of life and love to give. I deserve love, not this shit.

Do i feel lonely? Yes. Do I want to find love? Yes. Do I feel sad about not coming home to a loving partner? Absolutely. YET, all of these sad feelings are only massively amplified and made worse by dating apps use.",25,1757730554.0,WomenDatingOverForty,3,0.96,False

I’m researching the habits of Australians when it comes to takeaway coffee and reusable cups. Whether you use a reusable cup every day or never have, I’d love to hear your perspective.

I'm exploring an idea for a collapsible reusable coffee cup that’s more compact than most existing designs and made from biodegradable materials — something easier to carry and better for the environment.

The survey takes less than 3 minutes, and is open to Australian residents only.  
There’s an optional email field at the end if you’d like to hear about the idea or take part in future prototype testing.

Thanks so much — your insights are invaluable!

In yhe past few years the hitting has died down mostly because I chose to spend most of my time outside my house , but recently it has become a little much . I was having an argument with my mom about television usage when my grandmother wants to watch and it got heated . Most of it was her yelling at me but then she started swinging . I kept raising my hands as she yelled at me to put them down , she hit me twice once being a half slap half punch in the face and another in the stomach. The entire time she was getting mad calling me an animal and saying I am trash. Two days later I accidentally fall off my bed and of course she comes asking what happened with an angry tone . Embarrassed I spend the next couple minutes lying saying I didn’t know . She then gets mad and reaches for my phone . I yank it towards me as she starts yelling for me to give her the phone , eventually in the struggle I drop it between the bed and the wall , she asks me to retrieve it a couple times to each time I respond “how “. She then yells at me and says to not call her mom as she calls me an animal and trash again . I genuinely can’t remember if she hit me anytime during this . Arguments with my dad go a little better when I’m at his house . He usually yells and threatens to do big things like throw coffee at me or his shoe , often only slaps me a couple times when I try to speak . I’m asking Reddit what should I do ?

Some time in the 2000s, society started to shift toward widescreen (16:9). At first I didn't like it, it was much more straining on the eyes, having to constantly look left and right, and not be able to see all the information in one go.

I said at first. But do I like them now? Well... no. I still feel the same about them as I did in the early 2000s. Whenever I look at a 4:3 aspect ratio screen, I feel instantly relaxed. I can see all the information I need without having to strain my eyes. I feel like someone has just brought me a nice warm coffee and put a blanket over my lap. I feel at home.

In fact, this goes deeper for me. It's symbolic of how society has become as a whole. Always looking for bigger and different. Never content. Always looking for the next shiny thing. Never satisfied with what we've got. But we've forgotten to enjoy simplicity.

I get to my closing shift today at 1:30, joke around with the openers and clock in, it's all good. I wonder where my shift coworker might be but I have orders so I just think they'll be late, 'cause they have been in the past. So by the time like four rolls around I've kinda given up on the fact that my coworker will come in, that's annoying of course but I can handle it. That's about the time when some pastry distributors come in and leave some of their wares. And so now I'm thinking that i need to put them away in the fridges. When I have a chance to do so I realize that the fridges are full and that I'll have to rearrange the hell out of everything so that everything fits. That's when I really start to get angry about my coworker not being there. Coffee orders I can handle, rushes i can handle. This sort of stuff is better done by more than one person and I can't do it all with ease so there I am making coffee after coffee after matcha after coffee while boxes of pastries hang out in the background waiting to be put away. Then at about six, my coworker frantically calls me, they're a gen z er, to call someone is against their nature, they then text me if I'm okay and that oh they forgot that they had a shift and they hadn't seen the schedule and ""oh do you want me to cover the rest of the shift?"" And by this point i'm tired and hungry and could use the time to rest and eat so I say yeah, sure. They even have the balls to say ""could you punch me in, i'm like five minutes away"". Then I lose track of time doing orders and finding space for pastries. Then I look at my phone again and there's a message saying that ""oh i don't think it'd be worth it to punch in when i'm only gonna work two hours"" I'm both flabber and gasted at the temerity of this and can only answer with a ""dude are you serious?"" And they reafirm the fact that they are serious. I just let it go because I had other stuff to do and when I had the time I screenshotted the conversation and sent it to the boss. I punched out at 9 when I'm usually done by eight sharp. Then when I got home my cat had puked on my bed. That was the real cherry on the top of an already shitty day.

Most of us spend more time planning a weekend trip than planning the work we’ll do for decades.
A career isn’t a single big decision—it’s a series of small, deliberate choices.
But how often do we stop and check if we’re actually moving toward a destination we want?

Here’s a simple Career Compass exercise you can try:
Grab a piece of paper and jot down honest answers to these 4 questions:
	1.What kind of work makes you lose track of time?
	2.Which problems in the world would you love to help solve?
	3.What type of people or culture bring out your best?
	4.What does “success” mean to you beyond money or job titles?

Then pick one small action you can take this month to move closer to those answers.
It might be exploring a new skill, setting up a coffee chat, or just researching a field you’ve been curious about.

Direction matters more than speed.
A small step on the right path beats running fast in the wrong one.

What about you?
Which of these four questions feels most important for where you are in your career right now?
I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences.

1nflv79,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nflv79/is_rejecting_a_coffee_date_as_a_second_date_a_bad/,Is Rejecting a Coffee Date as a Second Date a Bad Idea?,"I do want to say that I’m not against coffee dates as a first date. However, the guy I am interested in suggested a coffee date for the second date after our first date which was at a bar (which was only at a bar due to timing and him canceling the original date which was coffee). I’m not concerned about him spending a minimum amount on me, but it feels like he’s being very low effort, hence why I rejected it and texted him on my feelings about it.

Here’s some context and I may or may not have discussed with him:

1) He said I’m the only one he’s dating, but I remember seeing a Hinge notification on his phone on the date (I didn’t bring it up).

2) While I agree my reaction is partly due to my experience of guys making elaborate lies when in reality they just wasn’t interested, but when he cancelled the original first date, it was due to an issue with the door at his home. He then suggested that I come over to his place or do another FaceTime with coffee. This made me feel like he just wants something casual and I wanted either reschedule or I’m not going to continue with him. But we did meet up for the only date so far, which was the bar.

3) After he suggested a coffee date for the second date, I made a suggestion for an activity that wasn’t expensive (it wasn’t cheap either, but later on during the day, I said it was only $30 per person since I saw it cheaper directly on the website and it was an activity based on something he liked), he then didn’t respond until I decided to cancel it since I did not hear back from him by a certain time today.

4) He then came clean about not being crazy about the price because of it being something he liked but not that much. So then I rip the band aid about how I felt he was being low effort. I sent a long message on the details saying the dates so far were low effort, that i didn’t mind the first date being low effort, and that it makes me feel like I’m only worth a small amount of money and time.

1nflq0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/folklore/comments/1nflq0o/la_sombra_loba_of_puerto_rico_written_by_me/,La Sombra loba of Puerto Rico written by me,"Long ago, in a quiet town tucked between the hills and forests of Puerto Rico, life was gentle. The coquí sang every night, and the children ran barefoot through the streets. And yet, as the elders always said:

“Even in the sweetest land, the darkest teeth may bite.”

The town did not know peace for long. For one day, a beast came. Not fully man, not fully wolf, but something in between. Eyes like fire, teeth like knives, claws that could tear both flesh and soul. They called it… the Wolf Demon.

No one knew from where it came. Some said it was a curse. Others whispered it was a spirit denied rest. But all knew it killed without mercy: children, women, men—no one was safe.

The elders spoke its name quietly: José.

José, they said, had once been kind, gentle, a man who loved animals more than anything. Birds, dogs, even the smallest insect—he tended them all. But one day, he ventured into the forest, and the forest claimed him. Wolves, or spirits, or some dark hunger—nobody could say. His family never came searching. They thought he had left. They forgot him.

And the townspeople soon learned that forgetting a kind man can awaken monsters.

They tried to stop it. They tried their guns, their knives, their prayers. Nothing worked. Nothing.

Then came Jesús. A man who did not tremble. A man who did not flee. The townsfolk whispered: “He walks with courage, or perhaps with madness.”

Jesús forged a sword from silver—the only thing that could harm the beast. And one night, when the Wolf Demon appeared in the square, dripping blood, eyes burning, claws ready, Jesús stepped forward.

“Beast,” he said, voice steady, “I give you one chance. Leave this town… or face me.”

The creature roared, a sound that shook the stones and froze hearts. It charged.

Silver met fur. Steel bit flesh. The townspeople cowered, hiding behind doors, their prayers trembling in the night. And all the while, the elders whispered:

“Even the fiercest storm can be faced, if courage shines brighter than fear.”

Blow after blow, strike after strike—they fought. Pain burned in the beast, but rage burned brighter. Claws swiped, teeth snapped, and still Jesús did not falter. Until, with one final swing, he cut the beast’s arm from its body. It collapsed, blood dark as coffee staining the cobblestones.

Jesús held the silver sword high. “If you are only a beast,” he said, “then this is your fate. But if a man remains inside you, a mind, a soul—then leave, and never return.”

The creature’s breathing shook the night. Its eyes, wild yet glimmering with something human, locked onto Jesús. Slowly, a clawed finger pointed at him, trembling.

And it spoke in Spanish, voice rough but familiar:

“No olvides… la deuda de la sangre.”
(“Do not forget… the debt of blood.”)

Then it turned, disappeared into the forest, swallowed by shadows and silence.

The town never forgot that night. They said sometimes you could hear a cry carried on the wind, half sorrow, half rage. And always, the elders would whisper:

“Remember the debt of blood. Remember the kindness that was forgotten. Remember the teeth that guard what men have lost.”

Years passed. Jesús grew old, gray, his hair like silver threads. He sat in his yard, watching the line of trees where the forest began. One warm evening, his granddaughter came running.

“Abuelo,” she asked, “why are you out here?”

Jesús smiled faintly, eyes fixed on the horizon. “I am admiring nature. You know… sometimes the most beautiful things… can hide the greatest fear.”

Her eyes widened. “You mean the wolf creature? The one you fought? Did you kill it?”

Jesús stayed quiet a long while. Then he said, voice low, calm, full of weight:

“No. Let’s just say… it’s never truly over.”

The girl followed his gaze. The trees whispered. A shadow moved. And for just a heartbeat, it seemed the forest itself held its breath.

Jesús’s hand tightened around the silver sword across his lap. Moonlight gleamed on its edge. His eyes never left the dark line of wilderness.

The elders say, to this day: the beast still roams, watching, waiting, and the debt of blood… is never forgotten.

And so the story is told, night after night, in every village, by every fire:

“Even in the sweetest land, the darkest teeth may bite. Courage may shine, but the forest remembers… and the debt of blood is never done.”
