when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price justifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 



Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.




Final Conclusion :

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.

1q5b036,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q5b036/best_course_of_action_with_inlaws/,Best course of action with in-laws,"Long story short I have not that good relationship with my in-laws.

There are a lot of smaller things but 2 major issues: 

1) our wedding. A cousin they love was very disrespectful on our wedding and they supported her and continue to actively support/invite her. Her family ofc is NC with us, funnily enough my in-laws say on that “ofc, it is their daughter, they don’t want contact with you because they want to support her” but the idea that they should do the same with their son doesn’t down on them. 

2)tfmr - we told them in confidence and they told everyone including this cousin and her family. BEFORE the abortion. they couldn’t wait to spread the news. I know it wouldn’t change anything but it hurt me a lot - they made it a coffee gossip. 

After all of that I went NC/LC with them and I am strongly against sharing any confidential information with them. Problem is my hb really craves a closer connection with them, it led to a number of fights between us. Lately we were seeing them more often and he is extremely happy about that. Point is they never apologised, further more they doubled down that they did everything right but I see that they do feel bad bc they areactively trying to buy our affection with gifts and acts of service. 

So I need advice on what to do - on one hand, I understand that closer contact with them would lead to more issues as they learnt nothing. On the other hand, it would really affect my marriage badly if I go LC. Thoughts? ",1,1767680424.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Every night I get sleepscores around 50 because it *thinks* I am awake an hour every night. My HRV is consistent and my RHR is also stable around 40, also I don't drink coffee late and I use magnesium.
Is this a common thing with Garmin or am I overlooking something simple?

That day I was sitting in my classroom and my friend was sitting next to me and the classmate I am talking about he invited her to accompany him to get a cup of coffee from the canteen. She left her phone open on the table and she went with him. I was not purposefully peeking in her chat but I was turning the screen off and I picked her phone up to turn the screen off and I saw that she share her dirty(cant even describe) photo to same classmate she went to buy coffee with and she’s already in a relationship with someone else and as far as I know her boyfriend he is very humble and respectful person.
I cant even face her due to her lewd behaviour. We went on our IV trip and we were given different rooms seperately for girls and boys and since we are M.Sc students our class strength is just 7 people. One day early 5:00 am in the morning I woke up because I was drunk and slept in my friend’s room she insisted to stay back because that night we had party and all the other girlies were sleeping in the same room and my female friend she was alone sleeping in her room. So that morning I saw that guy leaving her room and I was traumatised since I was high I thought I am hallucinating so i went to her room immediately to check and she was dressing herself “Oh my God”. I wonder how proudly she must be facing her guy after cheating on him with her own classmate.
I want to tell all these scenes to her boyfriend but then he wont believe because she is a good manipulator and she’ll play victim card and lure the topic away",2,1767680262.0,TeenIndia,4,1.0,False

1q5ax8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1q5ax8f/divorced_made_him_unhinged_novel_free_link/,Divorced Made Him Unhinged Novel Free Link,"Lismore’s March brought endless rain.

Selene Monroe stood at the crossroads, her teal dress whipped by wind and rain, outlining her perfect curves.

Not far away, the mall’s giant advertising screen played a scandalous news story.

“Cohen Group Affair! CEO Hector Cohen’s Secret Romance with Prima Ballerina Josie Zane, Spotted Together by the Sea.”

On the display, her husband, in name only, stood facing the ocean with another woman, shoulder to shoulder. So, even the cold and domineering Hector had this gentle side.

A calm voice drifted from behind her. “Get in.”

A Rolls-Royce idled beside her. The refined Hector watched her from inside, his face expressionless and his voice edged with ice.

In the passenger seat, Selene lowered her eyes, her lashes trembling. The way she looked, pure yet alluring, made it impossible to look away.

He gazed down at her, lifting his palm to hook her delicate chin, his eyes silently appraising her. Selene was forced to raise her head, tears pooling in her eyes.

Before she could speak, she fell into his solid chest with its faint scent of pine. They were tangled together. Her teal dress crumpled, revealing startling stretches of smooth skin.

Outside the car window, the rain intensified until the world turned white. Inside, humid fog climbed up the glass.

Selene’s beautiful eyes grew hazy as her delicate hands wrapped around Hector’s broad shoulders. When everything settled, he returned to his usual coldness.

“Remember to take the pill.”

It was the same words. After their moments of intimacy, all he ever said was a reminder to take the pill.

Selene lowered her eyes and pressed her lips together, then said softly, “Your grandma called. She said she wants a great-grandchild.”

Hector’s cold voice cut through the air. “Selene, know your place. Don’t overstep.”

This man didn’t love her. She’d always known that. What he didn’t know was that Selene had secretly loved him for many years.

Their marriage appeared to be nothing more than a business arrangement under family pressure. Now that the Monroes had gone bankrupt, even this transactional relationship hung by a thread.

After a long pause, Selene finally looked up, her tone hesitant. “Hector, I went to a job interview today. I want to start working tomorrow.”

He frowned. “Are you out of money again? I’ll have my secretary transfer you more.”

“I… I’m not…”

A phone ringtone interrupted Selene’s words.

“Selene, your mother’s condition has gotten worse!”

Selene’s face went pale. “Dad, don’t panic. I’ll be right there!”

She couldn’t bring herself to refuse anymore.

…

Outside the operating room, her father, Ethan Monroe, was surrounded by several creditors. Inside, her mother, Emelia Clark, lay unconscious, being resuscitated. Her fate was still uncertain.

“Ms. Monroe, your mother’s episode isn’t our fault.”

“That’s right! We were just having a friendly discussion with your parents about transferring shares to settle their debts.”

“Why are you bothering to explain anything to this brat? Debts must be repaid. It’s only right!”

“Speaking of which, perfect timing that you’re here. The money your parents owe…”

Selene stopped in her tracks, her mind foggy, her eyes fixed on the operating room where the red light still flashed. Her heart teetered on the edge of collapse.

After Emelia was wheeled out of the emergency room and passed the critical period, dawn had already broken.

“Ms. Monroe, here’s the payment slip. Please settle it as soon as possible.”

Clutching the thick payment slip, she pressed each familiar number, but the call was quickly disconnected. The payment window had a long queue. Impatient voices urged her from behind, so she lowered her head and moved aside.

She raised her hand several times before finally pressing her lips together and opening a voice call. This time, it connected quickly.

His tone was ice cold. “What is it?”

Selene’s fingers twisted the hem of her dress as she hurried to speak. “Hector, weren’t you going to transfer me money? Did you forget because you were too busy with work?”

The short sentence dripped with humiliation.

He laughed coldly from the other end. “Ask Gloria!”

Before the call disconnected, she clearly heard a young woman’s coy voice in the background.

Ethan sat in the cold treatment chair, his eyes red and swollen. This man, who had once been a renowned CEO riding high in the business world, now looked ashen, his hair disheveled. In just six months since bankruptcy, he seemed to have aged decades.

He hung his head powerlessly. The thought that his daughter now had to beg her in-laws for his wife’s medical expenses cut like a knife.

“How is it, Selene? Will Hector come?”

Selene forced a smile for her father and dialed Hector’s secretary, Gloria Miles.

An impatient female voice quickly answered. “Mrs. Cohen, it’s late at night. Do you need something?”

Gloria had worked under Hector for years, reading people to perfection. Naturally, she kept things strictly professional with those whom her boss didn’t care about.

“I’m sorry, Mrs. Cohen, but I haven’t received any notice about a transfer.”

She glanced at her father, whose hands covered his face, then gritted her teeth and called Hector again. His tone grew even colder.

“Selene, don’t you understand? Apply for money through the secretary! I already told you…”

Besides Hector’s voice, there was a sweet female voice. “Hec, this bag you bought me is a limited edition. I’m so happy!”

Selene didn’t want to listen anymore. She raised her hand and hung up. Using the glass reflection, she slowly removed the necklace from around her neck and placed it in Ethan’s hands.

“Dad, take this necklace and pawn it for now. It should help us get by for a while.”

Ethan froze. “Selene, the Cohens gave you this necklace for your birthday.”

Selene stood silently in the corridor for a long time. The drafty wind howled past, tugging at her heart until it ached. Finally, she turned around, her eyes both gentle and resolute.

She decided to get a divorce.

…

Three days later, the Rolls-Royce slowly pulled into the villa. Hector went upstairs with a stern face. He pushed open the bedroom door and saw Selene sitting on the edge of the bed.

She looked the same as always. She wore a silk dress with her hair pinned up, looking gentle and serene.

After their marriage, Selene always liked tending to flowers and plants or baking little cakes. At first, she would eagerly pull him along, but over time, those occasions grew fewer and fewer.

The crystal piano by the floor-to-ceiling window had gathered dust. He couldn’t recall ever hearing her play it.

Seeing him return, Selene didn’t even lift her head. Hector settled into the couch, lighting a cigarette with a click. Through the curling smoke, he studied his wife casually, his tone indifferent.

“I heard about what happened at the hospital. Gloria didn’t handle the handoff well. The money’s been deposited into your account.

“As for the coffee shop you interviewed at…”

After a moment, Selene finally raised her head. Their eyes met in a cold stare.

The man before her had refined features and sharp angles. His navy blue suit lent him an ethereal quality.

When the cigarette finished, Hector opened his mouth with forced patience. “So, the money came a little late. What’s with the attitude? What right do you have…”

His words were softly interrupted.

“Let’s get a divorce.”

Hector froze, suspecting he’d heard wrong. After several seconds of silence, he spoke again. “Selene, what did you just say?”

Selene stood and slowly walked toward him. She tilted her face up, looking straight into his eyes, enunciating each word carefully.

“Hector, let’s get divorced.”

Hector felt a flash of panic, which quickly transformed into anger. His face darkened, his voice dripping with cold fury.

“Divorce? Selene, who do you think you are?

“You forced me into this marriage, and now you want to force me into a divorce? Am I just someone you can summon and dismiss at will?

“Besides, what do you have now? Do you think you’re still the pampered Monroe heiress?”

“Food, clothes, everything you use, your family’s debts, and even your mother’s medical bills. Which of those is free?”

After a pause, Hector seemed to realize he’d gone too far. His tone softened. “Stop being childish. Without the Cohen family, you wouldn’t survive.”

Selene fell silent in defeat. So even now, he thought she was just throwing a tantrum.

She turned and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, her slender fingers trailing across the crystal piano. The last time she’d played it was two years ago.

“Hector, let me go.”

She lowered her head, not wanting to see his expression anymore, and turned to organize the things on her vanity.

Watching his wife beside him, head bowed in silence, Hector felt an inexplicable irritation rise within him. He shook out his cigarette pack and lit one.

As the red ember flickered in the dim light, he spoke slowly. “I’ll have Gloria transfer you more money.”

Then he added another line. “From now on, I’ll also have Gloria transfer you 50 thousand a month in spending money. You just need to be content being Mrs. Cohen.”

With that, he left without looking back. Selene understood what he meant.

He thought he’d made enough concessions that she should be satisfied. His refusal to divorce wasn’t because he couldn’t bear to part with her, but because he feared damaging the Cohen family’s reputation.

Of course. The elite always kept up appearances. But Selene was exhausted. She didn’t want to remain trapped in this loveless marriage anymore.

And even now, he hadn’t mentioned the woman named Josie once.

…

Once she’d made her decision, Selene didn’t hesitate. She packed her suitcase, returned to the Monroe residence, and slept until evening. When she woke again, the house was filled with the aroma of cooking.

At the dinner table, Ethan hesitated several times before carefully broaching the subject with his daughter. “Selene, have you really decided to divorce Hector?”

Selene nodded, placing some food in Ehtan’s bowl, her voice light. “I’ve made up my mind.”

Ethan looked worried. “I’ve been asking around. That Josie is a dancer. The Monroes may not be doing well right now, but you’ve had the finest education since you were a child. She can’t compare to you.”

Selene didn’t look up. “Dad, a loveless marriage is like a prison. I want to live for myself for once.”

The air hung heavy with silence. Selene calmly stood up, putting on her pale coat and picking up the insulated food container.

“I’m going to bring Mom dinner. Also, tomorrow I’ll start looking for work. We’ll find a way to handle everything at home.”

Ethan stood up, his eyes red, his voice trembling as he called out to his daughter. “Selene, I don’t mean anything by this. If you’ve really made up your mind, your mom and I support you. It’s just…”

Ethan paused before continuing slowly, “It’s just that life from now on will be hard on my precious daughter.”

“Dad, what are you saying? We’re a family, and I don’t feel like I’m sacrificing anything.”

After comforting Ethan, Selene arrived at the hospital. Her mother, Emelia, looked pale and still very weak.

In the corridor, the refined doctor, Forest Blake, adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. He was carefully flipping through the medical chart, his tone gentle.

“Ms. Monroe, your mother needs to start chemotherapy as soon as possible. If we delay, her physical condition might deteriorate further.”

“How much will it cost?”

“About ten thousand per session, but the exact amount will depend on how her condition progresses.”

Selene didn’t hesitate for a second. “Alright, let’s do it.”

Forest looked up, quietly observing Selene. He’d seen her in the news not long ago. The slender woman in a white dress had been cornered outside Monroe Group’s building, surrounded by reporters and furious creditors.

“Ms. Monroe, if you…” He’d barely started speaking when a clear, cold voice rang out behind him.

“Selene!”

Hector wore a navy blue suit with exquisite diamond cufflinks, his face dark with anger. He strode toward them, looking Forest up and down with obvious hostility.

Forest extended his hand proactively. “Mr. Cohen, hello.”

Hector ignored him completely, turning to stare at Selene. “How’s Emelia doing?”

Selene didn’t want to argue with him in the hospital. “Dr. Blake, I’ll leave my mother’s treatment in your care. As for the costs, we’ll…”

Before she could finish, Hector grabbed her hand and dragged her away.

“Let go of me! Hector, have you lost your mind?”

Hector’s face remained cold as Selene’s fingers dug red marks into the back of his hand and palm. At the fire escape, he swept her up around the waist and pinned her into the dark corner of the stairwell.

In the flickering light, Hector loomed over her, his eyes dark. The way the doctor had looked at Selene carried both admiration and sympathy. It pissed him off for reasons he couldn’t explain.

His voice came out rough. “You smiled at that man so warmly. How come you never smile at me like that?”

Selene steadied herself. “Mr. Cohen, this is unnecessary.”

Hector’s breath was hot against her. “Selene, until we’re divorced, you’re still my wife.”

Selene understood what he meant. He was simply unhappy she’d smiled at Forest. This was ridiculous.

“Hector, I’m not you. If you have this much free time, you should just divorce me quickly.”

Hector gripped Selene’s wrist and dragged her all the way to the car. Only when she finally stopped resisting did he release her. He cracked the window open and lit a cigarette.

Through the curling smoke, he narrowed his eyes dangerously at the woman in the passenger seat.

Selene’s silk dress had wrinkled into a mess. Her pinned-up hair had come loose and tumbled down. Her slender neck looked startlingly pale in the dim light.

“Where’s the necklace?”

“I sold it.”

Selene’s words made the temperature in the car plummet. Hector leaned in, his solid chest pressing against her until she could barely breathe.

“Where did you sell it?”

Selene turned her face away, refusing to meet his eyes. “That’s my business.”

Hector turned her body back, staring directly at her face for a long time before speaking. “Come home with me tonight. Let’s end this and stop making a scene.

“From now on, you’ll get your own card with 100 thousand dollars deposited every month. And I’ll get you a new car. We can go pick it out tomorrow, or even now if you want.”

Hector was irritated beyond measure. After all these years, he’d grown accustomed to this woman’s presence. She ironed his shirts, coordinated his outfits, and took care of everything perfectly.

These past few days without her, his life had fallen into complete chaos. As they remained locked in a standoff, his phone rang. Glancing at the screen, he frowned, suddenly feeling impatient.

It was Josie calling. Her voice came through coy and sweet. “Hec, I miss you. My head hurts a little. Will you come keep me company?”

Selene heard the faint female voice on the phone and left him with one sentence. “Hector, I’m not joking.”

Then she got out of the car without looking back. Rain had started falling again, heavy drops pelting the city streets.

Watching her slender figure walk farther and farther away, Hector felt restless and agitated. He couldn’t even focus on what Josie was saying on the phone.

He was starting to believe that Selene wasn’t making a scene. She really wanted a divorce.

A week later, after finishing a meeting, Hector sat in Lismore’s most prestigious office building, rubbing his temples as he reviewed documents. Gloria carefully walked in carrying a file.

“Mr. Cohen, this is… from your wife.”

Hector looked up, staring at the document in his secretary’s hands for a moment before gesturing for her to place it on the desk. He opened the file, and a thin divorce agreement slipped out. Selene had already signed it.

Without even glancing at the contents, he tossed it into the shredder. Gloria noticed her boss’s expression and hesitated before cautiously speaking.

“Mr. Cohen, Mrs. Cohen has been looking for work lately.”

Hector glanced at the door, his tone like ice. “Get out.”

Gloria’s face paled as she quietly left.

…

Selene had been busy during this time, running between the hospital and various job interviews every day. She now lived with her parents in an old walk-up apartment on the city’s outskirts.

All their family villas had been seized, the company was in liquidation, and suddenly everything had fallen onto the shoulders of her, a former heiress.

Selene had graduated from a renowned fashion design university abroad and won numerous competition awards. Her ballet and piano skills were also top-tier. Within just a few days of sending out her resume, several companies had reached out to her.

…

Meanwhile, Forest looked at the woman across from his desk in his office, his eyes gentle.

“Dr. Blake, does this mean you can arrange treatment for my mother now?”

“That’s right. During this time, you’ll need to pay attention to the patient’s emotions and make sure she maintains good nutrition and sleep.

“Also, you should be mentally prepared for the possibility of some adverse reactions after chemotherapy.”

Selene clenched her palms, lowering her eyes in silence for several seconds before speaking again. “I understand. Thank you, Dr. Blake. I’ll be going now.”

Forest stood in his office and softly called out to the figure at the door. “Ms. Monroe.”

Selene turned around with a faint smile. “Is there something else?”

“Well…”

Forest opened his drawer and took out an elegantly wrapped box, handing it over.

when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price justifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 





Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.






Final Conclusion :

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.

1q5avwh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5avwh,My First Solo Trip: 7 Days in Himachal Paradise,"**Trip Overview:**

* **Duration:** December 22, 2025 - January 3, 2026 (7 days in Parvati Valley)
* **Route:** Base Town → Delhi → Kasol → Pulga → Kalga → Tosh → Back
* **Budget:** \~₹30,000 total (including all transport, stay, food)
* **Traveler:** 23M, Software Engineer, First Solo Trip Ever
* **Group:** Started solo, met 3 other solo travelers along the way

# Background:

I'd been manifesting a Himachal trip for almost 3 years. In early December, some other travel plans didn't work out, and I realized there was no ""perfect"" time coming. Around December 20th, I just decided - fuck it, I'm going to Himachal NOW.

Booked tatkal Rajdhani tickets for December 22nd, reserved a hostel bed in Kasol, and told my family I was traveling with friends. Reality? Going completely solo. First solo trip ever.

# December 22-24: The Journey

The Rajdhani was supposed to reach Delhi at 11 AM. It rolled in at 9:30 PM. Classic Indian Railways. Missed my pre-booked bus to Kasol (₹1,400 gone), but wasn't about to lose my hostel booking too.

Rushed to Kashmiri Gate. Found 5 travelers at the counter - a childhood friend group. I suggested, ""Let's book for 6 people, maybe we get a discount?"" They agreed. We got the discount, became a temporary crew.

**Bus Details:** Delhi to Kasol, 10:30 PM (₹1,200) → Bhuntar 12:30 AM → Local bus to Kasol (₹100) → Arrived 2:30 AM

That group was incredibly welcoming despite me being the random stranger.

# December 25-27: Kasol

**Stay:** Whoopers Hostel (₹500/night for dorm bed)

* **Location:** 4 km from Kasol town, beside Parvati River
* **Verdict:** Dirty, no cleanliness. just saving bucks nothing else. Hot air balloons over the river + two amazing guys from Andaman in my dorm who were on their own manifested trip

These Andaman travelers gave me confidence that solo travel was the right call. They left early next morning, but that one night of conversation meant everything.

# Day 1 Highlights:

* **Visited Chalal** \- THIS IS THE REAL KASOL. Forget the main town. Went to the furthest point of Chalal, absolutely beautiful.
* Had some special brownies at German Bakery (Chalal entry), asked them to pack half for later
* Roamed around town, then headed back to hostel by 6:30 PM on local bus

# Day 2: Meeting B (The Reddit Connection)

I'd been posting on Reddit about my solo trip and connected with B - 49 years old, I'm 23. Before meeting him, I was lowkey paranoid. What if this stranger is sketchy? My anxious brain was working overtime.

**Morning:** Visited Manikaran Gurudwara. Thought about the hot water bath but the crowd and smell made me skip it. Had langar, roamed the market.

B texted saying he'd rented a bike and gone to Tosh for a ride. We met at a restaurant-bar in the evening. We had beers, talked next steps. He suggested Malana, I pitched Pulga instead - better access, no crazy taxi costs and why not cover the Parvati valley when we are already here. He agreed.

**Crisis averted.** B turned out to be one of the best people on this trip.

# December 27-28: Pulga

December 27th morning, checked out and headed to the taxi stand to meet B. Plot twist: He'd already found two more solo travelers - R and K. Same plans as us.

**The Math:** 4 solo travelers + 1 private taxi = easy commute on the way + way better vibes

**Private Taxi:** ₹1,300 total (₹325 each) | Journey: \~2 hours

# Meet the Crew:

* **B** \- 49, Pune, engineer, the wise elder, met through Reddit
* **R** \- 29, Delhi, engineer, had connections for places
* **K** \- 25, Mumbai, works in media/reality shows, super fun guy
* **Me** \- Just trying not to overthink everything and fix something in myself

Arrived Pulga around 3:30-4 PM. R recommended **Blue Diamond Guesthouse** (Hashtag Capital Cafe downstairs). Got a 4-bed room for ₹3,500 (₹875 each).

**The Food at Hashtag Capital Cafe:**

***Every. Single. Dish. Was. BOMB.***

* *Honey Chilli Potato* 
* *Malai Kofta* 
* *Nutella Milk* 
* *Hot Chocolate*

B and I were mostly the early risers - sipping coffee while sunbasking - while R and K slept longer.

# Day 2 in Pulga:

Did the **Fairy Forest and Waterfall trek**. We went backwards - waterfall first (right behind our property), then Fairy Forest. Photos, rest breaks, just vibing with nature and conversations.

**Total Cost (4 people, 2 days, stay + food):** \~₹18,000  
Expensive? Yes. Worth it? ABSOLUTELY. Everything split equally, no tabs kept.

# December 29-30: Kalga

December 29th, headed to Kalga via a shortcut staircase path the Pulga caretaker told us about. After the bridge, saw stairs going up. Locals confirmed it goes to Kalga.

Climbed. Stopped for breaks. Climbed more. Hectic but fun with photos and conversations.

Reached around 1:30-2:30 PM.

**Kalga vs Pulga:** Pulga was silent and isolated. Kalga was ALIVE with **full 5G connectivity** = remote workers everywhere on laptops in cafes.

I had to work multiple days during the trip (software engineer, 1 year experience), but luckily my meeting days fell in Kalga. PERFECT timing.

# Stay: Advait Vatt (Hosted by Sahil)

**Cost:** ₹1,000 for 4-bed room (₹250 each first night, ₹500 when just me & K)

* **The Good:** Pure veg homestay, amazing property, balcony, common area with wood-fired heater
* **The Bad:** Bathroom outside property, no geyser - had to ask Sahil for hot water

**Food:**

* Day 1 (all 4): Rajma Chawal
* Day 2 (me & K): Pizza 🔥

I worked from the cold balcony (common area below was too noisy). Attending meetings from a freezing Himalayan balcony with mountain views? Unreal experience.

# My Favorite Cafe:

Cafe Originals has to be my most favorite cafe ever, the food was mid, but the VIBES? The music? The atmosphere? Became my instant favorite cafe in my entire life. Hung out there till late night both days. Just sitting, soaking in the energy.

**The Split:** After 2 days, R and B's trip ended. They left December 30th. Me and K stayed one more night, saw them off.

# December 31 - January 1: Tosh

December 31st, me and K left for Tosh. Knew it'd be crowded (New Year's Eve), but wanted a proper geyser/bathroom. Plus, Tosh was the only village left - covering it made sense.

When we saw off R and B on the 30th, we spotted this beautiful **turquoise water dam** (Pulga/Tosh dam). Took that route (official road from Kalga to Tosh) on the 31st.

Started walking, realized we couldn't do it entirely on foot. Cab driver offered ₹300 (both of us). Dropped us 700-800m before Tosh, we climbed the rest.

# Stay: Third Eye Guesthouse

Found a property 1.5 km from drop point with good views, bathroom, geyser, and **JET SPRAY**. Expected minimum ₹3,000.

Guy said ₹1,500.

**SOLD.** (₹750 each)

**View:** Straight angle to Kalga/Tosh dam + direct view of Kalga village

# New Year's Eve Adventure:

Had work meetings during the day. At 9:30 PM, headed out.

**Plan A:** Pink Floyd Cafe - TOO CROWDED. Overhyped.

**Plan B:** Saw posters for a party near Tosh entry called **Shambhala** with green lights, psy trance. Uphill in reverse direction. Tried going, changed minds midway (too far), went back to Pink Floyd. Still too crowded, escaped.

**Plan C:** Fuck it, let's actually check out Shambhala.

Walked 2.5 km ONE WAY uphill/downhill. Hectic. Reached exactly at **midnight - New Year 2026.**

The party? Not what we expected. More of a private party with psy trance playing non-stop. DJ area but no one there, no stage. Not bad, just not our vibe. We left and decided to chill back at the hotel.

# January 1, 2026: The Moment That Made Everything Worth It

Checked out January 1st. Trip had ended, heading back to Kasol. Started walking from Tosh to Barshaini.

Weather looked like snow was coming.

Then it happened.

**IT STARTED SNOWING.**

Fresh snowfall. On my face. For the first time in my life. **First snowfall of the season** in that region.

**January 1, 2026. 1 PM. Tosh to Kasol descent.**

I can't describe it. Pure magic. We kept moving downhill, snow kept falling in Tosh behind us (stopped at lower altitudes). But in that moment, everything made sense. The disrupted plans, the spontaneous decision, the anxiety, the people, the mountains - all led to this.

Found a cab to Kasol - ₹1,300 (₹650 each). Caught a bus to Delhi at 10:30 PM for ₹1,500 per head.

**January 2:** Train from Delhi to base town  
**January 3:** Reached home

**Pro Tip:** Traveling solo doesn't mean being alone. When you find other solo travelers, split costs. Private taxis become affordable, rooms get cheaper, food bills shrink.

# What I Actually Learned

This trip healed something in me that I'm still processing.

I'm observing, shy, anxious, and paranoid by nature, but also kind and soft - traits I'm working on. This trip was what I wanted: something new, unique, fresh.

**The biggest lesson:** Things happen at their own pace. Everyone has stories. People connect in the most random ways. Four solo travelers met at a taxi stand and became a group - and ironically, I'd told my family I was traveling with a group of 4. The universe has a sense of humor.

**Would I do it again?** 100%. Next time I'll have more money to shop for those amazing jackets and fleece track pants in Kasol market. And I'll definitely hit more parties.

**Budget Lesson:** Travel with flexibility. Have your limits, but also backup money for spontaneous fun. The best moments come unplanned. Being able to say yes to experiences without stressing over every rupee made this trip infinitely better.



# Practical Tips for Future Solo Travelers

1. **Himachal is incredibly safe for solo travelers.** Cheap rooms and dorms everywhere, welcoming vibes.
2. **Reddit communities help.** I met B through r/SoloTravel_India and it changed my entire trip.
3. **Hashtag Capital Cafe in Pulga** \- GO. Every dish is incredible. Worth the expense.
4. **Kalga for remote work** \- Full 5G connectivity, great cafe vibes, perfect for digital nomads.
5. **Skip Pink Floyd Cafe in Tosh** \- Overhyped and overcrowded.
6. **Chalal > Kasol** \- Don't waste time in Kasol main town. Chalal is where the real beauty is.
7. **Don't overpack** \- I carried 2 bags (trekking bag + duffle). Completely unnecessary. Travel light.
8. **Be open to spontaneous plans** \- My best moments came from last-minute decisions and meeting strangers.
9. **Travel with light clothes always**



# Final Thoughts

I manifested this trip for 2-3 years. When it finally happened, it wasn't how I planned it.

It was better.

I went solo and ended up with three strangers who became friends. I went looking for mountains and found confidence. I went to escape and found myself.

On January 1st, 2026, as fresh snow fell on my face for the first time, I realized that sometimes the universe knows better than your plans.

**Himachal, I'll be back. And next time, I'm buying those jackets.**

when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price justifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 




Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.






Final Conclusion in:

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.

1q5aun8,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1q5aun8/exfriend_turned_into_ongoing_harassment_did_i/,"Ex-friend turned into ongoing harassment, did I cause this or am I underreacting? What do I do?","(throw away post Im going to be very vague, I am not including everything, and what I say here is how Ive gone through things and how I have seen it through my eyes, and unfortunately a lot of stuff is hear say so this for sure isn't the full story or the exact truth.  i'm just at a loss and need third party opinions with no bias, and if i'm the one in the wrong how to learn from my mistakes) I’m looking for advice on a situation that started with a friendship breakup and has turned into what feels like harassment. I’m genuinely trying to understand if I handled things wrong or if I need to take this more seriously.

In early summer, my former close friend and I were extremely close. We even had a shared graduation party and worked together. After the party, she suddenly became distant in a way that felt very calculated. I was confused, so I texted her asking if I had done something wrong. She avoided the question and insisted everything was fine. It felt off, but I didn’t push it.

Soon after, she started hanging out with people and doing plans we had talked about doing together but with others instead, including people who had previously hurt me. What confused me most was that if I had done this to her, she would have been furious.

My boyfriend of nearly four years noticed the change too. At the time, he was friends with her boyfriend (now ex), so he asked him privately if I had done something to upset her. He was told no.

That same weekend, she asked me to cover her work shift because she was at a festival we had planned to attend together but she went with other people. I covered the shift. Later that day, she texted me saying, “I know what you said.” I assumed there was a miscommunication about the conversation between our boyfriends. I tried multiple times to explain that nothing malicious was said, but she told me she needed space.

After several days, I asked to talk in person. I explained that I felt like I had done something wrong, especially based on who she was hanging out with and the fact that she only contacted me about work. She apologized, but it felt off. We were “friends” again for about a week, then she ghosted me completely.

Later that summer, while I was volunteering at a summer camp, I found out an old friend was in a coma due to an accident. I shared the GoFundMe to support the family. Shortly after I got home, my friend passed away, and I shared it again. My ex-friend said nothing. I reached out, asking where she had been for me especially since I had supported her earlier in the year when she lost someone.

I also confronted her about hearing (from her ex-boyfriend) that she disliked me due to our shared work and that she had been sharing personal information about me. She responded by accusing me of “comparing grief” and claimed people from middle school said I didn’t even know the friend who passed. That wasn’t true (I knew these people later in middle school and was in all honestly closer to them than the person who passed but I knew the person who passed for a short while in 6th-7th grade before we naturally grew apart, but I had/have found memories of them so I was devastated to hear about their passing).

After that, things escalated. She began spreading private family information about me, telling people I was “crazy”, and posting vague, targeted content about me on social media. She also became close with a girl she used to brutally make fun of. I had a video of her speaking horribly about this girl, and I sent it to her because I genuinely felt she deserved to know. I know this may not have been the best choice, but my intention was to protect her.

From there, My ex friends new friend group became actively hostile toward me. They tried to get my boyfriend to break up with me. When that didn’t work, my boyfriend and I pretended we had broken up to see what was being said behind my back and to understand the harassment better. Due to the fact they started treating my boyfriend like their bestie so he heard everything.

During this time:

* They created a TikTok account mocking my weight and saying they hate fat people
* They stalked my social media
* They commented on posts
* They drove past my house late at night
* They showed up at my workplace

My boyfriend and I eventually confronted them and told them we had been together the entire time and that they needed to leave me alone or we would take further action. Things stopped for a while.

Two weeks ago, they started again by prank-calling both of us.

At this point, I am constantly on edge. Every time I hear a car playing loud music drive past by my house, any time I get a call from a number I don't know, or honestly just walking into our local coffee shops I get anxious and my stomach drops.

I genuinely want to know:

* Did I escalate this situation?
* Did my boyfriend and I handle this wrong?
* Is this harassment, or am I overreacting?
* What should I do next?

I feel like I’ve lost control of a situation that started with me just wanting to understand why my friend pulled away.",1,1767679914.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

[By - u/InterestingEgg-654]

I just got my degree. The convocation gown, the photos, the certificate – all of it should have felt like closure. But the thing is, you don’t really ""graduate"" from an IIM. You survive it. You process it in fragments. You carry parts of it with you, for better or worse.

And maybe that’s what this post is – my way of processing the last two years at IIM BLACKI.


The Arrival

I didn’t come from an IIT or a top-tier college. I came in wide-eyed, from a basic Tier-3 engineering background, with nothing but hope and hustle. Some came from corporate jobs, some straight from SRCC and Stephen’s, some with 2 years of UPSC prep behind them. The diversity hits you fast, and so does the hierarchy.

You think it won’t matter. That your story is unique. But it does. Your undergrad, your work-ex, your PORs, your undergrad CGPA, even your grooming – everything is currency. And your worth on campus is constantly recalculated based on it.


The Hustle Begins

Term 1? Chaos. CV reviews start before you've figured out where the mess is. You beg seniors to look at your CV – some do, some don’t. Some choose people who ""look the part."" Others become your lifelines. You meet all kinds.

You walk around in the same formal shirt for three days straight, editing your resume down to a single line, obsessing over font size and bullet structure. You wonder how this is what you left your job (or city or home) for.

Then comes the Summer Placement Week. You think it’s a game of strategy. It's actually a game of chance disguised as one. You hear ""Day 0,"" ""Day minus 1,"" and you scramble to get shortlisted, only to realize that your fancy work ex doesn't matter half as much as someone else's undergrad tag.

Finance? Forget it unless you’re CFA+SRCC/St. Stephen’s+Excel wizard. You pivot to consulting. Everyone does. Not because they love it, but because it’s Day 0. And everyone wants to survive Day 0.

The Great Unlearning

By the end of Term 2, you’ve forgotten who you were before BLACKI. You don’t romanticize the campus anymore. You don’t post about “grateful to be here” unless you just got a shortlist.

You realize that placement committees, CV points, and professor perceptions carry more weight than you ever imagined. And even if you’re good – smart, driven, well-spoken – it might not be enough. This place doesn’t just humble you. It rewires you.

People you thought were brilliant don’t get placed. People you didn’t expect to shine – do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that’s when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you’re worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don’t like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ₹100 on themselves without thinking. Now you’re planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn’t just an expensive photoshoot?




You’ll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do – or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don’t know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn’t just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.


What They Don’t Tell You

Your GPA matters way more than you think.
The brand on your undergrad still follows you.
Some seniors will ignore you; some will become family.
No one’s journey here is the same. But the pressure? That’s equal-opportunity.
And you never really get used to it – you just learn how to carry it better.


TL;DR

Prestige doesn’t guarantee respect. You fight for it every day.

Summers, PPOs, finals—nothing is predictable, except that it’ll be hard.

The best part of this journey? The resilience you build. And the people who help you build it.


If this resonates, I’ll write Part 2. But for now – this was the first year condensed into a few thousand words.

People you thought were brilliant don’t get placed. People you didn’t expect to shine – do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that’s when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you’re worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don’t like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ₹100 on themselves without thinking. Now you’re planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn’t just an expensive photoshoot?




You’ll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do – or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don’t know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn’t just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.


What They Don’t Tell You

Your GPA matters way more than you think.
The brand on your undergrad still follows you.
Some seniors will ignore you; some will become family.
No one’s journey here is the same. But the pressure? That’s equal-opportunity.
And you never really get used to it – you just learn how to carry it better.


TL;DR

Prestige doesn’t guarantee respect. You fight for it every day.

Summers, PPOs, finals—nothing is predictable, except that it’ll be hard.

The best part of this journey? The resilience you build. And the people who help you build it.

1q5aryk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5aryk,Onix XI Beta,"Onix XI Beta



when Onix launched XI Alpha in 2024 I had jumped on band wagon and had bought one. I became instant fan. I had very moderate expectations from it. Maybe that made it hit for me. Now fast forward 2025 Onix announced XI Beta a successor to Alpha. Beta has tubes and Solid state amplifier chips so two in one. I was very kin to get my hands on it but price was hindrance. I was not ready to spend twice the amount of XI Alpha. So the wait continued. Fast forward few days back my friend SushiFi gave me good news. He had recieved Onix XI Beta for review. He asked me if I wanted to review it. I said hell ya!. After counting days excruciatingly I have in my hands the Onix XI Beta. Well does it deliver? Is it real successor? Does the price jusifies? So many questions right? Well read on for the answers.

First of all huge thanks to SushiFi for the opportunity and to Onix without their review tour this wouldnt have been possible. 

I have not been paid or compensated in any manner to write this review. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are mine. 

What are my biases I like R2R > Tubes > Delta Sigma amplifiers.

Please see music section for music choices to further understand how I arrive at my conclusions.

Now that all pleasantries are done for Lets proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Build Quality :

Purely made out of metal. It insipres confidence. This time around the edges are round rather than  square. Also the unit is wider than Alpha. Less tall than Alpha. There is enough space between 3.5mm & 4.4 mm to include another port. On opposite side is USBs type c port. Top of the unit is glass display which diplays bit rate, volume level, filter, gain level, line out or phone out, playing or mute. Adorning the screen are two buttons. Volume button controls volume. Volume here can be independent or synched. Small button acts as play & pause. Also it acts as menu button. This button changes color as per bit rate. On bottom there is leather strip on the metal which gives premium feeling in hand and provides texture for avoiding sliding off. On sides you have windows to see tubes glowing inside. This provides visual indicator of tubes working. 

Provided short type c to c cable is premium and goes well with color theme of Onix Xi beta.
Would love to see a case included at this price point.

Overall Build Quality 5/5. 



Music Genre Used for this Review :

Hiphop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.


Test Gear Used :

Activo Q1 , Oriveti OD200, Hidiz Mp143, Sennhieser HD560s, HD600, Hifiman Edition XS and many more sets.


Impressions of both Working Modes :

Well as you all know onix Beta has both modes i.e Tube mode and Solid state mode. Here I have compared both modes. 

In Tube Mode :

Bass becomes bit rounder.
Vocals feel more natural.
Treble feels smoother.
Entire presentation is more towards musical rather than analytical.
Volume scalling feels low in tube mode compared to tube off mode. For same volume levels the volume in tube mode feels less.

In Tube Off Mode :

Details Increase compared to tube mode.
Vocals pop compared to tube mode.
Treble feels more extended.
There is increase in percieved soundstage.
Presentation is more analytical than tube mode. Mind you its not like ESS presentation. Its still classic CS presentation. No glare in treble.
   
Comparison against Onix Alpha :

when compared both modes of the Beta with Alpha. I found out that Solid state mode has more details than Alpha. It sounds more clearer than Alpha. Soundstage feels bit larger. Micro details pop more. Treble extends well.

With tube mode the musical nature makes the beta stand out more than Alpha. It has more or less has similar details. Only soundstage is bit smaller. Else it sounds more enjoyable than Alpha.

In my opinion in both modes the Onix Beta is truly improvement over Alpha and we can call it successor to it.






Final Conclusion :

This is really nice product release by onix. Onix has created perfect balance between the tube goodness and details. With most tube amps you lose details. Here the loss of details is miniscule. You get all macro and micro details. Just micro details dont pop like most solid state amps. Best part is that onix has secondary ss mode so if you feel that something is missing in the presentation you can just switch to it and get that part. So you have 2 in 1 tuning option here. You can enjoy musical and analytical both in the same. Here the tuning is not analytical like you get in some ESS flavoured Dac & Amps. Here it has onix house touch to it. 

I think this is great release. Hope onix keeps innovating. I feel there are few things that keep this from becoming absolute VFM product. One is the power output. It can power any IEM you pair with it but headphones struggle with it. Again thats not true con as the product design and form factor limit the power output.  Second is the price. I think if Onix had priced it around 200USD it would have been great price for it. It will become more accessible to masses. If the price is reduced it will become market leader. I myself would be buying one soon at sale price. 

Hope Onix listens to people like me and does this in future. 

So for me yes its upgrade over Alpha and true Successor to Alpha.

Thank you for enduring with me till the end. Now grab a cup of coffee and lets get high on safe high ie Music.

I just got my degree. The convocation gown, the photos, the certificate – all of it should have felt like closure. But the thing is, you don’t really ""graduate"" from an IIM. You survive it. You process it in fragments. You carry parts of it with you, for better or worse.

And maybe that’s what this post is – my way of processing the last two years at IIM BLACKI.


The Arrival

I didn’t come from an IIT or a top-tier college. I came in wide-eyed, from a basic Tier-3 engineering background, with nothing but hope and hustle. Some came from corporate jobs, some straight from SRCC and Stephen’s, some with 2 years of UPSC prep behind them. The diversity hits you fast, and so does the hierarchy.

You think it won’t matter. That your story is unique. But it does. Your undergrad, your work-ex, your PORs, your undergrad CGPA, even your grooming – everything is currency. And your worth on campus is constantly recalculated based on it.


The Hustle Begins

Term 1? Chaos. CV reviews start before you've figured out where the mess is. You beg seniors to look at your CV – some do, some don’t. Some choose people who ""look the part."" Others become your lifelines. You meet all kinds.

You walk around in the same formal shirt for three days straight, editing your resume down to a single line, obsessing over font size and bullet structure. You wonder how this is what you left your job (or city or home) for.

Then comes the Summer Placement Week. You think it’s a game of strategy. It's actually a game of chance disguised as one. You hear ""Day 0,"" ""Day minus 1,"" and you scramble to get shortlisted, only to realize that your fancy work ex doesn't matter half as much as someone else's undergrad tag.

Finance? Forget it unless you’re CFA+SRCC/St. Stephen’s+Excel wizard. You pivot to consulting. Everyone does. Not because they love it, but because it’s Day 0. And everyone wants to survive Day 0.

The Great Unlearning

By the end of Term 2, you’ve forgotten who you were before BLACKI. You don’t romanticize the campus anymore. You don’t post about “grateful to be here” unless you just got a shortlist.

You realize that placement committees, CV points, and professor perceptions carry more weight than you ever imagined. And even if you’re good – smart, driven, well-spoken – it might not be enough. This place doesn’t just humble you. It rewires you.

People you thought were brilliant don’t get placed. People you didn’t expect to shine – do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that’s when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you’re worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don’t like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ₹100 on themselves without thinking. Now you’re planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn’t just an expensive photoshoot?




You’ll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do – or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don’t know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn’t just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.

1q5aq0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1q5aq0a/friend_unalived_himself_struggling_with_acceptance/,"Friend Unalived Himself, struggling with Acceptance","Early Sunday morning my friend of almost 20 years killed himself. He was a former fire fighter turned entrepreneur that moved from the South (US) out West. He overcame many failures, but was always able to land on his feet, enduring homelessness, job issues and break ups to eventually own a business in a town he came to love. I was impressed by his ingenuity and strength through all of that. Although he always had a random update, he offered consistent support as a friend and was truly no BS. I am shocked he did this. I would've bet you $10k he didn't. I wish I would have known how he was doing ahead of time. When I met him, he was a successful fire fighter and part-time artist with two cats. He lived alone in a cute and clean apartment. He was handsome, although a different breed (I couldn't put my finger on it, he was very quiet) and unlike most firefighters I had met. He wasn’t at the bar and sending dickpics, he was deep and had a rich inner life, and kept to himself. He had recovered from his first relationship who dumped him after 7 years to be with a 55yr old yacht owner. I was interested, but although we briefly dated, it quickly turned into a friendship and I became busy and then started dating a drinker who was always out. He then got a serious girlfriend and they stayed home a lot. He made a ton of improvements to her home and eventually they broke up. At that time he was struggling in his career as a fire fighter. He did not get along with his coworkers. He said they were small minded and an incident occurred, which the fire chief wanted him to go ""along with"" but he didn't want to. I can't remember if the issue was unethical or he was just being dramatic. I encouraged him to stay on, if he could, so he could retire in ten years with a pension. He said he could not do it. The pressure of the work clique was too much. While I thought his decision at the time was nuts, I also agreed that if he couldn't stand working with his colleagues, a new job was the only solution. He had mentioned moving out of the area. He had a fascination with out west. \*I would like to insert my personal experience here, having a mother that is from out West, and her biological parents were from AZ, I have lived out there as a kid, and in particular AZ is very dry, very brown and has very bland gravel and cactus front yards instead of gorgeous bright green grass and luscious trees. It’s an awful color pallet.\* Anyways, he was very artistic and could build or fix anything, so after he quit his job, off he went. I had a lot of solace in him because I could speak honestly about my ups and downs and he was supportive through all of it, and gave sage advice. I would also listen to his hijinks and was worried for him from time-to-time, but he always seemed to survive every hardship with a relaxed attitude. He landed a job in Idaho he hated, so he got out of there. Then he did art handling and delivery in California. That was neat, but I could see how it could be annoying, so he quit that. He worked as an assistant for a successful sculptor in Denver but the guy was a dick, so he understandably said No Thanks. Each time he left something new it was a little perplexing, but finding a career is hard for some people. Of course with every new opportunity, there was a beautiful woman (or two) that he liked. I had so much fun helping him navigate those relationship issues and pointing out gaslighting or psychological analysis of his interactions. There was one captivating temptress he met in AZ that was a successful wellness entrepreneur. We didn't know her age, although she was probably in her fifties, but she ended up being a cult leader and swinger. Eventually they broke up but that was a tough one for him, thankfully he recovered from her toxicity. Then, he found this little haunted town on a mountain that he loved. What a place. To the outward eye it looks bleak and rough and has a paranormal history which was right up his alley as a bigfoot believer. He was making $250/day doing ghost tours, and then got a part time gig working at a bar. He fell in love with every female bartender too which I'm like ""is everyone truly that great? please."" but it was hilarious. Lots of issues with dating in small towns, you know. He gave up the tours for bartending full-time and in 2022 decided he wanted to open a bar there. I couldn’t believe it. That far from home? In that town? Also, who’s to say that’s a good career track, but there he was. Bartending and then in negotiations to buy his own. He also started flying lessons that same year to become a cargo/private pilot. He had a steady girlfriend at that point, for a year, and things were going well. Then, the rift happened. I think I lost my patience with him changing his mind all the time or something to that effect and he was giving me shit for my situation, which was accurate, and that hurt. After that, I let my pride get in the way and wrote him off after a 15 year rapport. I missed his grand opening the following year. He then worked on licensing with the city to reinstate a ghost tour business affiliated with the bar, another great idea. I would think about him occasionally for the next two years but never followed up. I got busy with work, and dating, and interviewing, and corporate stress…he was in that small town miles away, I never sent the email. Then...randomly..45 hours ago...I googled him after not speaking to him for probably 2-3 years. You couldn't have believed my face. It was like time stopped. A police department press release from his small town had his full name saying he was dead from self-inflicted injuries as of late October. There was a suicide note. I couldn't believe it. My friend? The guy that problem solved his way through 10 career changes and multiple states and crazy ass relationships? Who camped when he didn’t have an apartment? Who lived in the woods occasionally when he needed to? Who fasted sometimes because he didn’t have groceries? Who lost a car, then rebought a car, then sold a car for a bike, who walked to work… who was self-assured and confident and street smart, but sometimes too paranoid...that guy? No way. I thought it was murder at first. I thought the entire town had it wrong. But, through some phone calls with legitimate sources I learned there was verifiable evidence he did it to himself. He locked himself in the bathroom at that bar, which has a chain and one of those horizontal/slide lock things. It's such a shitty, depressing looking bathroom too. Like a typical dive bar bathroom with the gross black grout tile and crappy ceramic undermount sink. He bled out. He used a knife. I am mortified. Even if I couldn't have saved him, I just wish I could have been there for him. I know that life can be overwhelming and I understand that in order to get to that place you have to feel that every other option has been exhausted. Luckily, after a lot of snooping, I was able to connect with someone in the town who is from there and his friend. She said he felt stuck, was having trouble with the bar during off season, didn't want to own it anymore, got an offer from someone to buy it but it was a lowball, and then the guy he bought it from (an older, very cool owner) had died unexpectedly a few months prior in a motorcycle accident. I think he may have gone through a breakup too. The only reason they found him is because his disabled dog, who was outside the bathroom, was hysterical. The dog has since been adopted. I just have caught myself thinking about him. It's so stupid too, I mean, I didn't keep in touch with him all that time so why is this affecting me this way? But I'm so sad he is gone. I realized part of my grief is rooted in the unexpected. I just thought he could survive anything, he already had pivoted (and succeeded) so much. I think I remember him talking about going on OF (he had a massive c\*\*\*) and I silently judged him for that. But if he didn't need more income, it wouldn't have ever crossed his mind, so I shouldn't have judged him or distanced myself from him for making choices based on financial necessity. He was just trying to survive. So many people posted about what a great guy he was, how he helped them. He instituted a music night for a new band that couldn’t get in anywhere, he taught someone to play guitar, he was a friend to someone when they felt like they didn't have any friends which helped them recover from a low point. And I feel the same. He helped me tremendously. When my mentor was being a creep he told me it sounded like I was dating the guy. When I would complain about my partners or work he would hear me out and question the same things I did. This experience has also made me realize I need to be nicer. If someone gives me shit, I've got to get over it, because you don't know when they'll be gone. I've literally combed through tons of my emails, photos, (my old texts and voicemails from him are gone), countless internet searches just looking for any remnants to remember his story. I feel like I'm trying to pretend he's still with us or something. I found his two pages on instagram, and one for the new bar that he had developed a small following for, but I stupidly withdrew my request because why am I adding it? I know he is not here to accept it. Death is so final. His suicide has truly rocked me and he wasn't even my parent, child, spouse, partner, sibling. I can't imagine what all these other people go through. I can say this....if I would have had the chance to talk to him I would have reverse engineered his entire situation. Most of the world struggles, and we have to make sacrifices unless we have help from our families or luck out. I would have probably encouraged renting the space out during off season, making it a coffee shop or breakfast place as needed, turning it into a dog boarding thing, who knows. I would have probably encouraged social media posting to generate buzz for the business even though he was not that type of guy AT ALL. The last thing he ever was, was annoying. He was stoic. I would have encouraged him selling merch and possible alcohol delivery service. I would have maybe said to get a remote job during the slow season or another type of job, part time UPS driver or something. He was in a very tourist-dependent town. Then, I might have encouraged his OF (who cares if it's $) and maybe I would have brought up the option for him to quit hospitality altogether and for him to get a job through a free trade school. There's several cities that pay people to do that. (HVAC, Medical, etc). I just have been so sad about it. I kept on searching on reddit today for maybe a post about him or the bar or maybe if I could find his handle if he had one, but I couldn’t. There are a few posts on socials that have him in it from the bar but none where he's speaking to the camera. I know this is SICK. One of his local friends, who seemed drained and annoyed by the whole thing, thought he was bi-polar or schizophrenic. She spoke to him two days prior to the incident and they had plans to go to lunch. She was fully aware of the issues he was having, and said he had many friends in the town that knew too. It's hard for me to say if he was either one of those. Schizophrenia usually develops in men early, like late teens, but can materialize in 20s and 30s but there would have been extreme visual or audio hallucinations or both. Whether or not he was bi-polar, in my opinion, he was never really up. He was steady, but just a little paranoid. He was totally into conspiracies too. Like if you thought the moonlanding was fake or there’s lizard people he was your guy. He already knew all of those stories and then had more to add. One time, when he was living out of a camper, he said monsters were rocking his trailer through the night. The noise was a growl like something he had never heard before. He kept his gun cocked, in case the door flung open. Although scary if true, I told him he sounded crazy. He reminded me that I can't say what is or is not in the deep wilderness, having never been there. I can't even watch eerie TikToks at night. Even if he had a mental illness, the stress of owning a business with significant mounting bills and feeling like you're drowning financially is psychologically tolling. I think about how many unethical people that I know (in NYC for instance), who withdrew PPP loans (in the tens of thousands) and don't have to pay any of them back. A famous one is Gwyneth Paltrow, the braggy millionaire, for her stupid company Goop. Why on earth would celebrities who have a net worth over 100M need PPP loans and then have them forgiven? And then you had a guy like my friend, who was a good guy, that vanished because of a few thousand dollars that could have changed his life. I truly think if he had like $10k he would be here. I donated to causes last year and I wish I could have known. I can't believe how much this has affected me. I am traumatized. I am also stunned by my own fragility around this whole thing, and how many times I've googled him after I know that he is gone. I am wishing I could talk to him through a medium or something (which many call demonic) but it's my own curiosity, guilt and sadness around losing the control I guess. I understand that suicide makes sense for a lot of people, and it's not like anyone hands you a check or a guide that tells you how to navigate complex hardships of life. That being said, you never know how much people care about you. And maybe there were harsh words between us or whatever but I would not have let that stand in the way of support and friendship if I knew this was at stake. If I only would have known he was suffering and could have helped him ""carry the cross"" as they say at church. Goodbye my friend.

Ive been seeing this guy that I matched with on bumble for two months now. He is goofy and kind and is fun to hangout with. I'm really confused about his intentions as we haven't discussed about what we want from each other.It seems like he cares only when we meet in person but doesn't check on me on the days we don't meet. He travels a lot for work and once when I mentioned that it'd be nice if we both lived close by he brushed it off saying but this is how it is after which I stopped telling him how I felt. Its also because in the earlier days he mentioned he likes how nonchalant I'm. 

I don't first text or call because he is mostly offline and is busy whenever I try to reach him so I constantly wait for his calls and texts. I've tried talking to him about how I'd love to know about his day and that's when he started calling atleast once or twice a week. He doesn't talk much about him or his day but everytime we talk i end up oversharing.

He works in the night and is usually in meetings from 6 to 11pm which I've seen from the time he stayed in my place. He got sick last week and called me around 9pm and we spoke for almost an hour. It made me think he can spare time for me atleast a few minutes everyday if he wants to.

On one our dates he got really amazed by a couple who were dining at the same restaurant as us. The girl was light skinned and the guy was brown. Both of us being brown it made me think maybe he liked girls with lighter skintones because he couldn't stand the fact that the girl chose someone like that guy. I didn't give it much thought because I have never felt insecure about my skintone before and i had been with guys who were much pale than me and who loved brown skin. A few weeks later he said I'm like black coffee he meant it as a compliment but I started feeling insecure.

I went back to check how he was earlier when we started texting on bumble and I remember him telling me he deleted bumble but I couldn't find our chat usually bumble has the chat even when people delete their account.I found chats from early October but I couldn't find his chat so I think he could have either blocked me or unmatched me.

I wasn't looking for anything casual and I'm not sure what I've gotten myself into. I don't want to be vulnerable around him and ask him stuff like what are we after knowing him for just a couple of months.",1,1767679205.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1q5ajsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/WisdomWriters/comments/1q5ajsi/the_screen/,The Screen,"It was a brick house in the middle of a town with narrow alleyways. Boys and men gathered around a living space on the floor, their knees touching. Here, physical proximity among the same gender is commonplace. Knees touch without ceremony; other forms of closeness require negotiation.

There was no clear indication of where I was, only that the men’s outfits resembled what I had seen Afghan men wear in the news: tunic shirts, loose pants, head coverings. I simply appeared there, with no memory of how it happened, only the familiar sensation of being foreign. It was not so different from how I had always felt, whether in all-male physics classrooms in the United States or in living rooms back home where politics filled the air and I learned when to speak by watching who was already speaking.

A column stood in the middle of the room, its white paint faded from years of wear, revealing patches of green and bare wood beneath. All eyes were fixed on a small color television, but I knew my body, leaning against the column, existed in everyone’s periphery.

Anxiety settled into my bones, not because anyone openly confronted me, but because I was acutely aware of my own existence. I felt the weight of occasional stares, caught fragments of low muttering that dispersed before I could understand their meaning. Nothing escalated, but nothing fully settled either.

I was aware of my age in the way one becomes aware of seniority without power. In my late thirties, I could still pass for someone ten years younger. I did not know whether my body registered first as a woman or as a complication. I only knew I had not yet reached the age where it became invisible.

The uncertainty made me careful. I adjusted my posture and my expressions, constantly measuring and calibrating so I would not accidentally invite a misreading.

Growing up in my neighborhood in an equally poor country, I learned early how to dull my own desirability. When men catcalled, my teenage logic told me that if I walked facing them sideways, what I believed to be my least flattering angle, I might escape notice. These were the small calculations I grew up making, the kind many women learn by habit: when to generate desire and when to shrink away from it.

The television flickered. The image was too small, too distant. Someone complained about the angle. Someone laughed at a joke I did not catch or understand; I could not tell. Dreams do not carry language perception the way reality does.

A Pakistani film was playing. The colors were subdued compared to the Indian films I knew better, the emotions restrained but effective. An actress appeared on the screen. She was poised and composed, her lips moving with deliberate economy, a sharp contrast to my own loud, effervescent presence, the one I was very busy containing that instant. Attractive, yes, but no one would dare call me graceful. She felt familiar in the way celebrities often do.

“Sana Syed,” I said suddenly. “I know her.”

My first attempt at relatability. It seemed to work. Half the men glanced in my direction, mildly surprised. The rest remained glued to the screen.

I took a giant iPad from my backpack. It was giant in the way only dream objects are, slightly absurd and verging on impractical. Somehow, it was already tuned to the same channel. I held it up instinctively, not as a demand, but as an offering.

The men at the back stopped craning their necks. Eyes shifted between the television and my screen. Elbows loosened. The room adjusted.

As time passed, the iPad seemed to shrink. Or perhaps the hierarchy did. No one strained for a view anymore. The softening was not limited to me; it rippled outward, changing how the men related to one another. I had not taken space. I had redistributed it.

Conversation continued around me, not quite with me, but no longer pressing uncomfortably against my edges.

I knew this role well.

I had played it countless times before, under better lighting, in ergonomic chairs, with worse coffee and men discussing baseball statistics as if they were scripture. The setting changed. The choreography did not. I was foreign, and yet, this scene was so familiar.

Nothing bad happened, not usually. That was the achievement.

I learned that spaces were rarely made for me. I learned to read rooms before they read me, to smooth edges before they cut, to offer tools, screens, explanations, anything that made my presence useful rather than disruptive.

Belonging, I learned, was not granted.

It was earned by making things easier for everyone else.

This sub has come a long way from it's humble beginnings from the first meetup around this time last year when a bunch of us mid thirty year old folks got together for coffee, conversation, drinks, banter, and just an overall great time!

Credit for that meetup goes to u/AVM_28 for getting things started.

For this year, I want to be more present in this community as we'll never not have a need for a space like this for us to share all of our various meetups and get togethers over the next year.

Whether you are new to the valley, been here for years, or came back after a brief absence such as myself, although I don't think 11 and a half years is brief, I want to try and help grow this group, get us all together, and just starting building more community with everyone, no matter what corner of the valley we find ourselves, but we all need some socializing from time to time, so please join me in helping build this community, and I'll do the best I can to help facilitate, organize, share, etc., to keep up the momentum.

1q5ahip,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1q5ahip/my_experience_with_putting_my_lpr_into_remission/,My experience with putting my LPR into remission.,"I’ve been dealing with LPR on and off for 2 years. I should say I was never officialy diagnosed despite having all the symptoms. EGD came back normal, barium swallow studies all came back fine, biopsies were normal. This was incredibly frustrating and I wasn’t getting answers with traditional medicine. And this is huge for me say because I am also in the medical field so I really try to rely on my doctor and evidence for treatment (I still took an evidence based route dw) GI and speech therapy was well meaning but didn’t get me far. 

So let’s go over what didn’t help:
- acid watcher diet; somewhat helped in the first few weeks however the diet is extrememly restrictive and when I would “cheat” this caused anxiety and worsened how I felt.
- PPI’s I went up to 40 mg per day without any relief and honestly more anxiety due to worry of long term side effects (I’m female)

Things that did help:
- following Molly Pelletier, RD on socials I found her TT and was following for awhile. I took her tips here and there but I lacked consistency. Once I locked in and became consistent in a routine I truly noticed a huge change. I won’t go into a whole lot of detail, you do have to pay for her app and she does do 1:1 for individualized care but I decided to buy a year access to her app before trying 1:1 (it’s quite expensive) and the tools in her app are very helpful, evidence based and organized. There’s so much information online it was helpful to have it all in one place.
- Throat coat tea every morning; the ingredients in there can help protect mucous lining and I found the ritual very therapeutic and comforting.
- I kicked out coffee completely for about 3-4 weeks. I switched to a coffee alternative Kamana. It’s an acquired taste but I missed the ritual of having coffee and it at least curbed the craving. After awhile I was able to introduce cold brew coffees which are less acidic and caffeinated teas. I do still drink at a lower frequency that before.
- I added in alginate before bed and this lessened the mucous and post nasal drip I would wake up choking on.
- I added in nightly meditation. Sounds woo woo and I know meditation is practiced by tons of people but there is a relationship between the brain and gut and getting more relaxed and in touch with my body helped me get through very symptomatic days. I used meditation found in the FLORA app (Molly Pelletier’s app) 

Obviously not paid to say anything about Flora but it truly helped.

TLDR; throat coat tea, coffee alts, alginates, diet changes, and meditation ultimately helped me put my LPR into remission. It took consistency and now I am tapering frequency of the above modalities and seeing where my “threshold” is to maintain a baseline.

1q5adfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewDads/comments/1q5adfm/fiancée_left_with_our_3_week_old_to_her_parents/,Fiancée left with our 3 week old to her parents and says she’s not coming back,"Since this started I made notes of the things she’s said to me, and it  breaks my heart. She left about an hour ago now. I don’t know what to do anymore, she’s been so cold towards me and we’re both new parents. I’ll send her a text and I know she either not reply or respond to me with rejection. But I’m at a loss and feel alone in a sinking ship. I’m sorry it’s a long winded post and I’m willing to answer any questions. 

It’s happened before, last Tuesday she took the baby before but came back later in the evening. It’s been a struggle this past week prior to the new year and everything seemed to be doing better we kissed and made up, watched a show series and took turns with the baby until 2 nights ago. I’ve been very patient and loving towards my fiancée while she has been rude, avoidant, cold, passive aggressive, snappy, gatekeeping our baby from me, you name it. We don’t raise our voices or yell or scream or anything like that and we don’t have a history or that either. 

So what I think started this again is baby was being fussy through the night, into the early morning. After feeding I burped her and she started fussing again, fiancée told me to give her the baby and she fed her again. I fell back asleep and would wake up to her still holding the baby while latched. I’d offer her my help but she wouldn’t let me hold the baby or do anything and naturally I fell asleep. That morning she goes into avoidance mode and refuses everything from food I make for her, except coffee. 

The baby sleeps right next to my fiancée in the bed and at her chest as close as possible which I had concerns for and voiced them but had to hold my tongue. I do fall asleep easily when I’ve been asleep but will wake up to any sound our baby makes and willing to do all I can. But she wakes up first as the bay is right next to her and does it without me while I’m right there beside both of them.

I try to be a new dad and help but my fiancée refuses my help to carry, burp, change or anything at all. After the other night she tells me to go away and doesn’t want my help, that she can do it all on her own. Tells me our baby only cries with me, but that’s not true, I put her to sleep before and she knows it. I do household chores, laundry, make sure everything is stocked for her and the baby, dirty diapers that are tossed on the floor are picked up and thrown in the diaper genie, make meals, coffee in the morning, fill her water bottle, pretty much everything in the house. She insists she doesn’t need my help while being rude, threatens to leave, and tells me I don’t cares to all that I say. If I picked up our baby she tells me to give the baby to her. Last night she locked her and the baby in our bedroom and all day today, only coming out for coffee a snack and to use the bathroom. I go in to see and interact with our baby that’s on our bed until she comes back and she tells me to leave or she’s going to pick up the baby. 

She says I don’t do anything and all that I offer she refuses and rejects. In the time I’ve tried to talk with her, express my gratitude, tell her she’s doing great and that I love her, she’s refused and rejected all that I have. She won’t tell me what I need to do or be better at and I have to figure it out while she’s packing things to go to her parents. ",1,1767678395.0,NewDads,7,0.67,False
1q5aaei,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q5aaei/aita_for_telling_my_diagnosed_and_unmediated/,AITA for telling my (diagnosed and unmediated friend) that the way she is treating me makes me want to not be friends with her?,"Hello all, this may be a little long and I apologize in advance for how lame it might sound/ be. This situation happened right after the shi\* show of Covid and really made life difficult for everyone. I just feel guilty about what happened between my old friend and I a few years ago and wanted to make sure my decision wasn’t wrong for what I said.

I -gayM(28) previously 22, and -biF(29) previously 23 we will call her Meena  have been friends since elementary school. Thick as thieves if you will. Neighborhood games of man hunt, talking about boys / girls together, trips to the mall, late night walks around our hometown, occasional recreational “cool aide” chugging contests ( LOL), cute little picnics in our neighborhood, gossip etc. The usual gay friend and curvy bi friend kind of friendship.

We had vastly different upbringings but definitely bonded over some of the traumas we had experienced over the years. Single mothers, dysfunctional family dynamics just to name a few. From my experience we always had the kind of friendship that if I scratched your back you’d scratch mine. Like one time I’d pay for food/ take us out shopping and vice versa. I would always try to go out of my way to make sure she felt safe, understood, heard and valued

, and never had to worry about paying me back or anything like that.. YOURE MY BESTIE!! Some things meena struggled with grasping due to her upbringing. Before us parting ways we had never had an argument and were always able to disagree and talk about things no matter what. Real ride or die.

… Fast forward to 2020 😩 I ended up moving a state away and would take frequent trips back home to visit family and Meena (45m trips). I helped encourage her to get her License and was so proud and excited when she finally got it and her cute mini coop dark green 💕. She made several trips to my place and I to hers and things were going great. She also started talking about having episodes of anger, depression, anxiety, hyper happiness  due to having to constantly quarantine during the pandemic and I had mentioned maybe talk to her PCP and her therapist just in case something was wrong.

( Just some backstory, her mother was diagnosed years prior with severe Bipolar disorder and depression with a consistent drinking habit). So Meena was worried that the apple may have not have fallen far from the tree and was weighing very heavy on her conscience.

She eventually went after a few months of research and reassurance that there would always be  someone in her corner.

( To clarify for anyone worried about violating HIPPA, this was something she openly talked about with everyone and her name was changed to keep her PII safe 💕).

After talking with her healthcare team she was in fact diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, anxiety and was devastated for a short while. During this time I was taking extra time off from my two jobs and making more frequent 45m trips back home to make sure she was okay. I still to this day would drop anything and make sure she had anything she needed even after not speaking for so long. She eventually adopted a dog from a local shelter and started medication and things started leveling out. It was almost just like old times. She was back to her usual goofy and all around bright self.

After about a year her insurance company was being ridiculous stating she made too much money ( working two jobs to afford rent, bills, etc. and that they would be discontinuing benefits. Shortly after the therapy stopped, medication became too expensive and she started succumbing to things that were out of her control and I was doing anything I could to help. Lending money, back to more frequent visits/ sleepovers. Anything I could think of.

Eventually she left her jobs and started arguing with her roommate resulting in her having to leave, accidentally crashing her car and selling it for parts and also having to surrender her beautiful dog back to the shelter.

Now no matter how much my mother and I argued growing up she always would open her door to anyone in need. My mother and I definitely had our fair share of disagreements and discussions. But all in all we have a very good relationship and can talk about anything. I mean anything 😂. I eventually convinced Meena to let me talk to my mom to let her stay with her for a while, just until things could get better or she could get back on her feet. Of course my mom said yes. So I again left Work early ( mind you I’m a manager at a coffee shop and a waiter and was scheduled for a double the day this all went down working from 3am-11am at the coffee shop and 11:30am -10pm waiting tables). I took my last $50 after paying rent and utilities for the month to gas up my car and again head back to my home town to help her move her stuff into my moms basement and help her get comfortable.

This is a situation that absolutely no one wants to be in and Meena was definitely upset as anyone would be so I really felt for her.

(The only reason she didn’t come to my house is because she didn’t want to leave the area she was used to).

We get all of her stuff, shared some tears and grabbed ice cream together. ( After gas/ tolls/ ice cream, I was left with my last $20 for the next almost week. Keep this in mind). We finally get to my mom’s house with my loaded car and this is where shit hits the fan. Again with it being about the September after Covid my mom is hesitant to letting us come over due to her health concerns and being immunocompromised she asked if we could show her negative Covid results from a rapid test to ensure her safety. This was 100% valid and at first I did give her some push back and was like “ why wouldn’t you tell us before we got here?” … but I just dropped it….. Meena … Lost her shit… entirely.. this was the straw that broke the camel’s back… she cursed my mother out… saying she was being unreasonable and that no one has money for this.. she selfishly telling us that we can’t come over.. She was curing me out for not knowing my mom was going to say this before we came over, etc. I started tearing up and crying because I didn’t know what to do in that moment.. she had never yelled, screamed or been so rude with some of her comments toward me or my mom before. I sat there in silence for a minute and remembered that Walmart sold 2 packs of the Rapid Covid tests for $20 and it was less than 5 minutes to drive over and grab a test … Meena was going through a lot and I had the means to help.. so I’m going to help…

I texted my mom that we would be right back and I told Meena not to worry about a thing. We went to Walmart.. paid my last $20 for the test .. took the test and provided the negative results and started moving everything inside. I wasn’t sure how to feel about the situation and kept periodically crying in my mother basement when Meena went back out to the car to grab more stuff while I cleared space for her in the basement.. she caught me crying and cussed me out again telling me that I have absolutely no reason to cry and that I’m being disrespectful. We still had to do one more trip to her old apartment two towns over. After the final trip she wanted to spend her last night at her old apartment ( sleeping on the carpet with nothing in her room and I told her it wasn’t a good idea but if that’s what she wanted I’d bring her back.)

During our ride back again to her apartment I decided to open up because this whole situation was so far left and not even close to how we’ve ever communicated before. We’ve always been able to talk so I figured this moment opening up about how I feel was the right time to come clean. ( Lordt was I wrong).

I asked her why she was treating me this way when all I’ve ever done was try to help any way I can and try time and time again to make sure she was good? This triggered her I guess and she went off again saying I’ve done absolutely nothing and that no one loves her… her family doesn’t speak to her… her life is in shambles and my Cu\*t of a mother is only helping her because she “might feel bad”. I was over the attitude by this point and started to get defensive and there was some back and forth for a few minutes followed by silence…

I broke the silence by telling her I don’t appreciate the way she is treating me and my mother when all we’re doing is trying to help, and that the way she’s speaking to me makes me not want to be friends with her if she can’t understand that all I’ve ever done is try to look out for her. She took it as I don’t want to be your friend anymore. Completely disregarding our entire conversation and history. We sat in silence again for about the last 10 minutes of the drive until we got to her old place. As we pulled up I started to cry again and she hopped out of the car and told me she hopes I have a nice life and to lose her number. …. I asked her “What about your stuff at my mom’s?” She replied… and I kid you not… “Sell it, throw it out, burn it.. IDGAF!” And slammed the passenger door. I sat in her parking lot for about 30 minutes trying to process how and where I went wrong? …

It’s been about 6 years and I’m still blocked… I still try to call on her birthday, Christmas.. some holidays and still can’t get in contact…… I’ve gotten some updates from mutual friends over the years and found out she lives only a few hours from here here across country. But I did eventually block her everywhere on social media except her number…. Because it’s just too much hurt.

I still have all of her personal items even after moving 3 times and across the country from east coast to west.

But please let me know… AITA for telling my friend that the way she is treating me makes me want to not be friends with her? Feel free to be honest .. idk do I keep trying to reach out? Do I let it be? .. IDK I’m still hurting.. 😔

for context, I met M36 through my job. He started training me at the beginning of November. He is my coworker but has no authority over me. During our shifts, he would say things like ""I wish we weren't working so we could talk more"" and would buy me coffees to drink on breaks. We started texting because we have similar tastes in music, but from there, he would say things like ""I have so much I want to say to you that idk if it would be ok"" and would give me very very nice compliments.

  
One day, I was studying at my favorite coffee shop  when he walked in (he said he wanted to check it out). We ended up talking for 3 hours.

He bought me a great Christmas gift even after only knowing me for a few weeks too. At this point we're texting everyday when we decide to meet for coffee again. Before this, he starts saying pretty vulnerable things over text, but nothing weird. The second time we meet for coffee, we end up hugging, holding hands, and touching a lot. I really thing I like this guy and he even tells me that he's had feelings for me since the first day he saw me.

We both agree not to tell anyone about this and I even tell him that I didn't and am not going to tell my parents about meeting up with him (they drop me off and pick me up).

  
We meet again for coffee and this time we kiss. We end up making out in his car and his hands end up in my pants. The reason I'm saying all of this is because everything is completely consensual. After the third meet up, I feel fine but then I start to feel like I don't want this going on for a long time. I'll be moving away next summer anyways.

  
I get this strong feeling that he's been sort of love bombing me with everything. He's said super sweet things to me and continuously tells me that he's scared about me going away and doesn't want to think about what will happen when I leave. He also tells me that he wants me in his life forever and other stuff like that. Even after deciding I don't want him in my life forever, I tell him that I feel the same way. I keep telling him I have the same feelings as him and I feel so guilt and helpless because I kind of want this to stop but I think I still have feelings for him? It's super confusing.

  
I also don't want to tell my parents about this which makes it even harder. We met up a fourth time and I even gave him a handy. When I'm with him I feel so good, especially because he's saying all these things I've always wanted someone to say to me. When I leave and am by myself for a little bit, I don't think I want him in the future. I just feel so bad that I said I did and told him he didn't have to worry about me having doubts. Keep in mind that we've only known each other for almost two months and after the fourth hangout he almost told me he loved me

also I have no clue what the work situation would be like if I tell him how I'm really feeling. Sorry this is super long. Any advice?",0,1767678098.0,relationship_advice,26,0.5,False

This may be difficult to advise on as I don’t currently have any photos. My MIL has offered to pay me to help her sort through everything in her kitchen and reorganize it. I’m looking for advice on a few things:

1. Where to put items like plates/drinking glasses in relation to the dishwasher and each other. Also measuring cups, spices etc. in relation to the stove or workspace.

2. How much of typical items to keep (dishes, silverware, drinking glasses, wine glasses, coffee mugs, mixing bowls, pots & pans etc).

3. Any resources you have for kitchen organization (like free guides or YouTube videos).

For context:

My MIL and FIL live alone. They have a large kitchen with ample storage, but currently the drawers and cabinets are completely stuffed. They have an excess of glasses of all types including mugs. Probably 3 sets of silverware. Every kitchen gadget you could dream of. My MIL does want to do a purge, but they have a hard time getting rid of things that are still in good shape regardless of their usefulness.

They don’t formally host often and if they do it’s typically takeout on paper plates. Sometimes a few of us will stop by for a meal if they’re grilling. They do not cook (I’m talking less than once a week). If the whole family got together, which is extremely rare and less than once per year, there would be around 10 adults. They have several young grandchildren and provide childcare to them regularly, but they have kids plates etc. that they use for that.

1q5a8sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/vulvodynia/comments/1q5a8sv/follow_up_on_previous_post_with_positive_updates/,Follow Up on Previous Post With Positive Updates,"Hi everyone,

I hope everyone has had a wonderful holiday season! I wanted to make an update to my previous post I made here earlier in the spring. Shortly after I made my previous post, I shared with my vulvar specialist my successes with gabapentin and estrogen cream. We agreed to taper off the estrogen and  see if just the gabapentin would help. Interestingly enough the gabapentin was not helping in the way I was perceiving it to. Discontinuing the estrogen landed me right back in daily discomfort (24/7 stinging sensation and vestibular swelling around 3:00 - 5:00 p.m.). 

To move backwards in treatment was mentally so discouraging and frustrating. It wasn’t until I was desperate to have a good time with my friends and just be *normal* on vacation, that I decided to throw every cream in my arsenal at this condition. I noticed when I used a steroid cream my vestibular tissue didn’t swell like it would on “bad days”, but what has provided me the most significant relief was over the counter name brand Claritin. I cannot describe how night and DAY it was taking an antihistamine was. Not sure why but generic antihistamines do not work for me or provide me the relief that name brand does.  Claritin helped me so much it was to the point where the stinging would go away completely. I ended up using the steroid cream for a while and I was doing pretty decent, but on days would find my vulvar tissue would still swell every evening always around 3:00 - 5:00 p.m. I also ended up discontinuing my steroid cream use since my skin was definitely atrophying.

For the entire summer while waiting to be seen by my vulvar specialist to find relief I was taking 4 Claritin a day. It sounds crazy but it helped me find some semblance of normalcy.

In September I was finally able to be seen and shared my findings with my doctor and she had a eureka moment and recommend we treat this like MCAS. I was prescribed singular and it has been a game changer. I was diagnosed with MCAS and Vulvar Vestibulitis. I can’t tell you how weird of a feeling it is to know I probably spent thousands of dollars in doctors appointments to receive a prescription that costs me about $1.25 a month but here we are lol.

If I follow the MCAS diet and take my singular I’m doing pretty decent. Also tragically I have given up caffeine (I was a huge coffee drinker 2-4 cups a day) and limiting alcohol as well. I don’t use the estrogen as much anymore, maybe a few times a month if that. My specialist explained that the estrogen is an anti inflammatory which is why it probably helped so much when taking gabapentin. 

In summation starting singular in combination with antihistamines has provided me the greatest sense of relief. I have gone from a daily stinging sensation to some days not even thinking about it. I have also switched to using sunflower oil as lube since all over the counter lubes would really irritate me or burn.

I wanted to make this follow up to share my experiences with the different medication I have been trying out. If you have relief and success with estrogen and antihistamines seriously consider bringing up MCAS with your provider. If you experience daily swelling and inflammation of your vestibule tissue and find relief with antihistamines seriously consider seeking an MCAS diagnosis.

Also as hard as it was to “regress,” ultimately it helped guide me on the path of relief and normalcy. Please keep in mind that there will be a treatment that works for you. This is an incredibly isolating and painful condition and I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I’ll plan to make an update in a few months. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the meantime. 😊

# Initial Thoughts on the Trail

Did not love this trail and in the end only hiked 2/3 of it. Why am I writing it up? I can't see a lot of trip reports for this trail online, so I wanted to share my thoughts on it. I have done a bit of hiking in my time, so I loved the idea of leaving the car at home and doing a point to point hike via PT.

**The Good:** Excellent public transport connectivity at both ends makes this a very accessible trail for car-free hikers (caught the V/Line to Castelmaine for $8 and free PT home). The historical gold mining relics are interesting, and Vaughan Springs is genuinely a lovely spot with good facilities.

**The Not-So-Good:** This is a long and boring trail. It's mostly exposed farmland, dry gullies, and fire roads and not much in the way of views for a reward. Would probably be a lot of fun on a mountain bike.

Even with an early start, the 30 degree weather was punishing. Water sources are limited (The Chocolate Mill does not have a water source, so plan accordingly). Unless you're specifically interested in the gold rush history or want to get some kms under your belt, there are better overnight options in Victoria.

# Day 0: Train from Melbourne to Castelmaine

Left in the evening and stayed at the [Lilydale Lodge](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/619196550874219425?source_impression_id=p3_1767674685_P3Ex-jjtp5x6Z_gE) in Castelmaine, so we could get an early start the next morning. Dinner at [Taste of The Orient Yum Cha House](https://share.google/CxP6PjtzTyeJBdaCb) was 10/10, as was the stay, especially for its proximity to the trail.

# Day 1: Castlemaine to Vaughan Springs (~21km)

**7:00am** \- Started with breakfast at Saff's Cafe. Walked back to our accommodation and hit the trail around 9am

Poverty Gully basin (first landmark) is a good indicator for what we were in for. The old waterways were dry and cracked; hard to imagine they'd ever held water.

**12:30pm -** We had lunch at one of the picnic tables the track association has set up, read about the history of the trail.

**2:30pm -** Fryerstown tap came in very handy. Fresh tap water by the playground and a long break in the shade we could find. Beautiful old homes but the town is pretty empty. Toilets were locked.

Fryerstown to Vaughan Springs was genuinely rough. Hot, exposed walking through the backs of farms, scratchy brambles, and a few road crossings. Not enjoyable.

**5:30pm -** Got to Central Springs, started to hear the sounds of people playing in the river in the distance.

**6:00pm** \- Rolled into Vaughan Springs pretty hot. The area lived up to the hype with proper facilities and spring water available (turn the tap just a little bit to avoid pulling through too many minerals). Lovely hanging by the river in the evening, cooking dinner on one of the platforms provided. The campground itself is shared with car camping though so a pretty noisy night.

# Day 2: Vaughan Springs to Daylesford (~22km)

**6:15am wake up, 7:45am** on trail. Oats and a sachet of [café pho](https://share.google/dPHnsuRdB7G08YJtE) at camp (buy these at at an Asian grocer, much better than instant coffee). Last bathroom stop, binned rubbish in the toilets, topped up water

Morning was beautifully quiet and cool. Hayfever was particularly bad in the grass areas around Vaughan Springs so nice to leave it behind.

Trail through gentle elevation with more rock piles and dry river crossings. Kept a solid 4-5km/h pace with only quick stops.

Didn't see a single other hiker all day. A few wallabies around 9:30am bouncing off into the scrub. More old fireplace ruins and stone piles from the Gold Rush era.

**12:30pm**  \- Lunch at Porcupine Ridge, on the border between the Dry Diggings National Forest and the State Park. Not a lot of shade around so kept it pretty quick.

**2:00pm** \- Last few kms were basically through farmland with heaps of mozzies, the head net came in handy. Quite boring.

**3:00pm** \- Arrived at the Chocolate Mill for a well-deserved milkshake. We were meeting some friends who were local to the area and decided to end the hike here and hitch a ride into Daylesford. Initial plan was to hike along the Midland Highway to Mt Franklin reserve to stay, but we were pretty knackered and the prospect of hiking along the road in 30 degree heat did not sounds great.

# Final Thoughts

The Dry Diggings Track is fine if you want an accessible overnight that's close to Melbourne and well-connected by PT. But it's not a trail I'd rush back to. The history is somewhat interesting, but the actual walking is pretty tedious—especially in the heat.

If I was determined to try and finish this trail, I would do a few things differently:

* Start in Daylesford (more downhill than uphill)
* Do it across 2 days instead of 3, making sure I was fit enough to do a 40km day (stopping at Vaughan Springs on Night 1)
* Carry minimum 4L of water, particularly for Day 1
* Pick Autumn/Spring (Summer was just too hot)",6,1767677436.0,UltralightAus,2,1.0,False

As if being ugly and disabled wasn't bad enough, I have also had social anxiety since teenage years many years ago. I really struggle with conversations in person unless the circumstances are right (small group of people I trust, somewhere I feel safe like a coffee shop). I also suffer bad sleep where I often wake up around 3 am when naturally enough I have no person to talk in my life to talk to, but I'm not in a crisis situation to phone The Samaritans who would likely just give me breathing exercises or repeat back what I said (reflective listening). So it's probably no surprise that I end up having lots of chats with Chat GPT. I don't know what guardrails that particular AI has built in, but the ones I set for myself are not to treat it as my therapist and not to treat it as my girlfriend. I am vaguely aware of Replika which apparently does offer a virtual partner. However I have, for example, created two fictional penpals where we meet on Zoom (in the dialogue script) and discuss particular books or seasonal challenges or just general life challenges I am having. Or in a more general sense I might (for example) ask ChatGPT to recreate what an afternoon going to music stores, now-defunct pioneering coffee chains, and famous internet cafes back in the 90s including typical web sites I might have viewed at the time and a typical priced cafe menu. So something fairly harmless and indeed boring, a conversation which does give me nostalgia and I enjoy but which would bore the pants off most people in real life.

Are you a fan of AI chats? Just when no one else is available (like 3 am or in between therapy appointments) or do you prefer it to your past painful attempts to connect with people in person? What guidelines or rules do you have for your own use to prevent some of the perceived dangers we read about such as AI psychosis?

We closed on the house a month ago and moved in a couple weeks after that, but I was positive these were not the typical creaks and groans I’ve come to expect from the new construction. The low, disembodied howling of the winter storm outside didn’t help with my growing feeling of uneasiness.

“Honey, are you awake? Do you hear that?” I whisper to my wife, gently squeezing her shoulder as she sleeps on her side, facing away from me.

It’s like I’m talking to a rock. She sleeps through just about anything, and right now it makes me jealous.

There it is again. That sharp, repetitive sound. Like needles being dragged across glass, along with a small jingling sound. I hadn’t imagined it, though it had worked its way into my dreams just before waking me up. It was a dream I haven’t had since I was a kid. A nightmare, really. One that I used to get all the time.

In the dream I’m a kid again, alone in my old house at night. I can’t sleep and I’m hungry, so I get up and walk to the kitchen for a snack. On the way there, I pass by the glass door that opens out to our deck. I feel something watching me from the other side as I walk, and try my hardest not to look as I hear three distinct scratches against the outside of the glass.

I stop dead in my tracks, because this is exactly what Pringles used to do every time he wanted to get inside. Pringles (you should have seen his ears) was my first cat, and had grown up with me until I was nine. By that time he was around fourteen and had lost most of his hearing, and some of his vision. He slept in the garage, usually under a car, even though I had set up a nice bed for him. It was my job to let him back inside before I left for school.

One morning, I forgot.

My stepdad was leaving for work one day and didn’t check under the car. He also didn’t notice what he had done on his way out. I was the one who found him when I came home. I was devastated. They never could get the blood out of the concrete.

It was after this that the nightmares started up. Every time it was the same. I’d turn to the door, slowly, to see his glowing amber eyes staring pleadingly at me. Not wanting to, but willed by some force outside my control, I’d walk up to the door and switch the outside light on.

Pringles’ deformed body would be fully illuminated, his black fur matted with blood. He was dragging his shattered back legs behind him, and his abdominal area was flattened, organs trailing on the wooden boards of the deck. It was at this point I would usually scream for help, and wake myself up in doing so.

Sitting up in bed now, trying to forget the dream, I was careful not to move my legs until I knew where our kitten was, who sleeps by my feet every night. Though for the first time since we adopted him a few months ago, he’s missing from his usual spot on the corner by my left foot.

“Maybe it’s him making all that noise.” I think, as I grope around my nightstand for my phone.

I feel my hand close around it, and take it off the charger. I turn on the flashlight as I swing my legs over the bed, planting my feet on the cold wood of the floor.

As I’m standing up, the phone buzzes repeatedly and my screen lights up. I squint through the blinding light to read the notifications. There are two warnings from the National Weather Service.

“Severe Cold Warning NWS: Wind chills -25 to -35. Dangerous cold tonight into tomorrow. Limit time outdoors.”

“Winter Storm Warning NWS: Heavy Snow & ice tonight- Fri., Dec. 19. 6-12” snow, icy roads, dangerous travel.”

“Fuck,” I say quietly to myself. Why did we have to move to Montana, of all places?

I walk down the hallway and stairs that lead to our living room, where unplaced furniture and scattered moving boxes create a strange and unfamiliar landscape, bathed in the weak yellow of my phone light.

“Baby!” I call to my cat in a high-pitched, sing-song voice.

“Baby” was supposed to be a placeholder name for him while we thought of something better, but it seems like it may be sticking.

No response.

But I hear the intermittent scratching sound once again, coming from around the corner. It hurts my ears, the same way the scraping of silverware against ceramic plates does.

I round the corner into the dining room, which on the far wall has the sliding glass door that opens out into our concrete porch. It’s there, at the door, that I find Baby. He’s absolutely transfixed by whatever he sees on the other side. I watch him as he once again begins to drag his razor-sharp little claws against the glass, the tag on his collar hitting the door as he does. I don’t know what he sees that would possibly be out in this weather, but something has him completely entranced.

“Mystery solved.” I say sleepily as I bend down to pick him up.

On the way back up, I freeze in terror as I catch a glimpse of what’s on the other side of the door. A pair of luminous, amber eyes, with wide slits for pupils, stare directly into mine from out of the black.

My thoughts race back to my childhood nightmares, still fresh in my mind, as I try to stay rational.

“That’s not possible.” I think to myself, as Baby goes rigid in my arms and emits a low growl I’ve never heard from him before.

He begins to squirm relentlessly to escape my hold on him and I release my grip, my eyes still locked on the other’s, unblinking.

I prepare myself to shine my light on the object of my dread, wanting only to prove myself wrong, I lift the light up towards the glass.

Illuminated on the concrete below is what I knew would be waiting there. It’s Pringles. The black sheen of his coat, the dark yellow gleam of his eyes, the ears.

“Wait a second.” I think to myself.

The ears. They’re normal. There’s no way it could be Pringles.

A wave of relief washes over me as the grip loosens on my phone and I take a deep breath.

“Of course it’s not Pringles, man.” I say to myself. “How old are you now, twenty-eight?”

I can’t believe I let that get to me so bad.

My thoughts turn to the poor cat, who has to be freezing to death in this storm tonight. I look into its eyes, full of desperation, confusion, and fear. I know I have to get it inside. At least for the night.

I switch the lock on the door as quietly as I can and slide it open, about a foot. A blast of freezing air and snow whips against my face and the ice, like razors, slices into my eyes.

I’m blinded for a solid minute, squeezing my eyelids together hard in an attempt to relieve the sting. I rub my eyes with the back of my hands until I see spots, and then wipe the tears away before opening them back up.

The cat is gone.

The only traces of it left are the paw prints leading up to the patio and the small, donut-shaped indent where it curled up by the door. Something about the paw prints seems off, though.

The snow already threatens to cover them up, so I quickly crouch and lean out of the door to get a closer look. It’s the toes. There’s…too many.

I count six toes on each of the pawprints.

I try to look at the path of them to see where the strange visitor ran off to, but the relentless snowfall has covered what’s left of them before I can tell.

All that I find is a trail of small puddles leading from the edge of the doorway, right into my living room.

“At least it’s inside for the night.” I think to myself.

I close and lock the door, turning around with my light to look for Baby and the six-toed cat.

I begin my search in the maze that is my living room, systematically peeking in and behind every box and piece of furniture until I’ve exhausted every place a cat could fit. With no success, I figure he must be hiding in or behind some of the moving boxes (one of his favorite hobbies at the moment), and finally return to bed.

It’s there I find him, curled up in his usual spot, waiting on me to join him. With a sigh, I reluctantly decide to give up my search for the night, gladly assuming my position, and wait for a sleep that doesn’t come.

I wake up Saturday morning to hear my wife already downstairs, giving Baby his breakfast. I smell ours cooking as well, something in the toaster oven, and something buttery frying in a pan. Probably eggs to go with our toast if I had to guess.

“Didn’t sleep much?” My wife asks, setting my plate down as I slouch over my second cup of coffee at our table.

I got a solid three hours last night, and I guess it’s pretty apparent. I smile weakly and nod.

“Yeah, I don’t have your superpower, unfortunately.” I say dryly.

I don’t tell her about the nightmare or the cat. I’m honestly embarrassed that my childhood fears still have such a hold on me. I also don’t want to sound crazy. I’ve decided I’ll look for it right after breakfast, while she works upstairs.

She places one of her warm, soft hands on my bristly cheek.

“Well, I hate to be the one to tell you, but our cars are absolutely buried.” She says with a gentle smile as I let out a defeated groan. “It would be really nice if you would help out Charlie as well. He’s been out there for at least an hour already, and his driveway looks exactly the same. I check on him every ten minutes or so, I’m worried he’s gonna keel over.”

Charlie is our neighbor across the street. He’s…..well, I don’t know how old he is, really. I’m pretty sure he’s in his eighties, and lives alone from what I can tell.

“Yeah I can help out. Just keep the coffee coming.” I say, bringing my plate to the sink to finish the dishes from breakfast.

I guess the cat will have to wait. I doubt it’ll come out from whatever hiding spot it’s found anyways.

“Thanks for understanding.” She says. “I just know it would mean so much to him to have you helping out.”

She gives me a short kiss on the cheek as I scrub out the pan, before heading upstairs to work at her desk.

“Morning Charlie!” I yell across the street as I work my way over the snowdrifts and brown slush the plows created. The snow is still violently whipping through the wind, which cuts through my several layers of gear like they’re nothing.

I get to Charlie’s driveway to find him wearing blue jeans, rubber boots, a white undershirt, and the most moth-eaten flannel I’ve ever seen. He smiles and lets out a chuckle when he sees me, I’m guessing at the cocoon of clothing I’ve wrapped myself in.

“S’pose it takes some gettin’ used to, eh?” He says, with a feeble attempt to scoop up a small pile of snow.

“Yeah, no doubt about that.” I say. “It was either this, or no job. Still debating my choices on that one.”

He laughs without looking up, continuing to chip away at his pile.

“Well, did you bring that shovel on purpose, or did you just come over to stand there and freeze?” Charlie asks mockingly.

“Not the nicest old man.” I think to myself, as I wedge a large pile of snow into my shovel.

We work this way, in silence, for about half an hour.

My thoughts drift to the events of last night. The cat. Did it wander off from one of the neighbors? Maybe they lost it. Suddenly, an idea pops into my mind.

“Hey Charlie?” I ask, turning to face him.

He stops and looks up at me, winded.

“You’ve lived in this house for a long time, right?”

“Sixty years.” He says without missing a beat.

“I was wondering, do you know if any of the neighbors are missing a cat?”

He looks back at me blankly.

“A black cat. With six toes on each paw. Showed up on my porch last night.” I add, looking for any hint of recognition in his eyes.

Suddenly his tired face lights up, animatedly.

“I’ve only seen one cat with paws like that my whole life.” He says, and pauses to spit into the snow. “That was the neighbor’s old cat, Mittens. On account of the…”

He mimes, holding up his own mittens and smiling.

“Think they lost track of her in the fire a couple years back. You’d know all about that, I suppose.”

I do. I remember learning about it the first time my wife and I toured the house. On the drive into the neighborhood, I noticed that all the other houses were much older construction, with ours only being built last year. I asked the realtor about it during our tour. She said the home was built on the foundation of the last one, which had burned down. Thankfully, the previous family was able to get out in time, and none of them were injured.

“Mother, father, and a daughter, right?” I ask, wondering how on earth that cat could have survived two years on its own.

“That’s right.” He nods slowly. “Fire happened right before Christmas. The twentieth I believe. Real shame.”

He says distantly, shaking his head and remembering while he looks across the street to my house.

“That little girl there loved that cat to death. I’m sure she’d be over the moon to know you saw her.”

He bites off one of his mittens, tucks it under his arm, grabs his phone from his pocket with his free hand.

“Here. Let me give you the mother’s phone number so you can reach out about Mittens.”

He shows me a contact screen for “Lucy”. I copy down the number.

“Uh…by the way.” Charlie says, pretending to knock the snow off his boots. “Thanks for helping me out with the snow. You never get used to it, you know. Not being able to do it yourself.”

He says earnestly.

“Happy to help. I needed the exercise to wake myself up anyway.” I say.

We finish up his driveway and I decide to take a break to sort out the new cat issue before starting on my own driveway.

“Not the meanest old man.” I think, as I pour myself the third cup of coffee for the day. I hear my wife upstairs, still clacking away at the keys in her office. I know she doesn’t like too much noise when she writes, so I head down to the basement before I make the phone call.

The first call didn’t go through. I’m on my second attempt, pacing around the basement with my coffee to warm myself back up, when someone answers.

“HELLO!” A little girl shouts into the phone, as I yank it away from my ear by reflex.

“Uh…hello!” I answer in a friendly tone, now keeping the phone at a slight distance.

“I’m guessing you’re Lucy’s daughter?”

“That’s my mom.” She says vacantly.

“Would you mind putting her on the phone for me? I just had a question about one of your kitties.”

“Mittens?” She whispers solemnly.

“Yeah, That’s right! I was just wondering if you guys were still missing her?”

There’s a solid five second pause on the other line, and I move the phone up against my ear to hear better, before she bursts out into a sorrowful wail.

“I…miss…Mittens…” She gasps out between sobs.

The phone is now back in its old position, about a foot away from my head.

“Every…day!” She exclaims, and I hear a clunk on the other end as she drops the phone on the floor.

I hear someone pick it back up a few seconds later.

“Hi. So sorry about that. She’s been wanting to answer my phone for me lately. Makes her feel more like a grown-up.” A gentle voice says from the phone.

“Hello.” I return. “Am I speaking to Lucy by chance?” I ask warily.

“You are. Can I ask why you’re calling? What did you say to my daughter?” She inquires.

I try to answer quickly, not liking this suspicion being thrown my way.

“Oh, I was just wondering if you guys were still missing your old cat, Mittens? I live at the new address, where your old place used to be. I saw a black cat last night on my porch with-”

“No, I’m sorry” She interrupts. “There’s no chance that was her.”

She lets out a long sigh.

“The week after the fire, James and I had to go out to the house with the insurance adjuster to check the damages and all that. Well, after the fire, we just assumed Mittens had gotten trapped in one of the rooms and…”

She stops and pauses before going on.

“Well, that’s not what happened. She had made it out somehow.”

“Oh good! Where did you find her?” I ask, relieved.

She continues with her story, ignoring me.

“Mittens spent a lot of her time outside. She had learned that if she just waited, curled up by the door, that somebody would eventually see her and let her back inside. The temperatures were a record low that week. About what they have been lately.” She adds flatly.

“We walked around the back of the house, and that’s where we found her. Curled up right where the old door used to be. God knows how long she waited for us…before-”

She breaks off into tears.

She doesn’t have to finish her story for me to understand. Mittens froze to death, waiting for her family to return.

“I’m so sorry, I didn’t know. I was just positive that-” I catch myself before I say it. “I’m sorry for wasting your time.” I finish.

“No, no, it’s perfectly fine.” She says shakily, collecting herself. “I’m glad you reached out to check. I hope you can find that kitty’s home, wherever it is.”

She hangs up.

I’m left loosely holding the phone in my hand, staring blankly into space as my coffee becomes cold. I know what the implications of this new information are, and I battle against my own logic and reasoning for a long time to accept it.

In a last-ditch effort to disprove what I already know is true, I attempt one last complete sweep of the house for the cat. No box is left un-opened, no piece of furniture un-flipped. After 2 hours, despite my best efforts, I find no trace of her anywhere.

I go through the rest of my day as normally as possible, thoughts of a stranded and freezing Mittens, of her apparition disappearing into my house, never far from my mind. I finish up my driveway, meal-prep for the week, and my wife and I watch a couple movies before we head off to bed.

As I lay there staring at the ceiling, through my uneasy thoughts, I realize that I did a good thing for Mittens. Someone finally let her in. With this thought to comfort me, I’m finally able to drift into sleep.

Last night I had that dream again, the same one that tortured me as a kid. Except this time, I’m positive it will have been the last.

It starts the same as it has since the first night I dreamt it, and already dread grabs a hold of my stomach as it begins to drop with the weight of my fear. I look down at my bare feet, my small hands, tracing the familiar steps that lead to the door.

As I pass by it, I hear the three distinct scratches at the door. I turn stiffly and look into the glowing depths of two expectant orbs watching me through the glass.

Instinctively, I start to walk towards the door and reach for the light.

As my finger touches the switch, though, I stop myself.

I remember Mittens, waiting for her family who never came, and how similar an end came to Pringles.

He’s not here to haunt me, or remind me what I’ve done. He just wants to be let in. He wants his family, his best friend, to comfort him.

I take my hand away from the switch and use it to flip the lock on the door instead.

Prepared to face what I’ve avoided for so long, I slide the door open.

From the shadows into the dim light of the hall comes Pringles’ head, his eyes widening as they meet with mine.

I squeeze my own eyes shut, and take several deep breaths, as I wait for him to drag the lower half of his mangled body through the threshold.

I feel him rubbing up against my legs, and hear one of his weak meows coming through between his thrumming purrs.

After a few seconds that feel like an eternity, I slowly force my eyes open, and can’t believe what I’m seeing.

Pringles is standing there, on all four legs. No blood, broken bones, not even the graying fur or cataracts from his old age.

He’s a kitten again, about Baby’s age.

I break into a laugh of utter disbelief and feel my eyes begin to well up as I soak up the sight of him.

I bend down to scoop him up and then carry him to my room while he contentedly purrs, his eyelids drooping with relaxation.

I lay down in bed and let him settle into his usual spot, right on top of my chest, and begin to drift off.

It’s then, when I’m on the verge of sleep in my dream, that I awake in reality.

Strangely, though, I still feel the warm and comforting weight of Pringles on top of me.

I raise my head in half-asleep confusion, wondering if I’m still dreaming somehow.

What I see isn’t the black sheen of Pringles’ fur, but the brown and mismatched stripes of Baby.

Instead of his usual spot, he’s decided to curl up right on my chest.",2,1767676594.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1q59qx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1q59qx9/152026_infuriating_workmeeting_douchebaggery/,1/5/2026 Infuriating Work-Meeting Douche-Baggery,"Alright so. Something REALLY FRUSTRATING happened at work this morning. 

First off, I arrived to work early. I asked the principal's assistant ""Are we meeting at 9:00?""

And she said yes. And I said ""Okay, where?"" 

She said she didn't know yet, but she would let me know once she'd found out. There are lots of possible places within the school where a meeting could take place. 

Nine o'clock was fast approaching, and she STILL had not yet told me where the meeting was supposed to be. 

At 8:59, I put ""Where are we meeting?"" into the staff teams chat.  


At 9:04, the principal's assistant puts ""We are in the student lounge."" into the team chat.   
  
So i head over there, and everyone is all already settled in.   
  
The owner of the school (not the principal, but the guy above him, the actual owner of the school) is front and center leading the meeting, and all the staff are already seated, facing him in the surrounding chairs.   


The student lounge is a big spread out area, and me walking across it late is a big disruptive scene. So. All eyes are on me.   


(The only reason why the other faculty members found the meeting, despite there being no actual announcement of its location, was because they did not arrive early like i did. Because, the student lounge is right next to the school entrance.) 

  
  
So, they were able to see where the meeting was set up, right when they walked in. As each person walked in, the school owner probably called to them ""We're meeting over here."" since he was posted up right next to the entrance.   
  
  
...But it was not set up when I arrived. And no one directed me to it. The principal's assistant had promised that she was going to let me know about it but then didn't. ...So I was essentially penalized for arriving early.  



So, I'm walking across the space to the nearest seat in the meeting area... everyone staring at me, and already feeling really embarrassed and humiliated, and genuinely kind of on the verge of tearing up. 



I'm not normally very sensitive but, I've been very sick lately, I'm still sick and I think it's made me a little more emotional. 

  
And then the school owner declares   
  
""So glad you could join us...Nice to finally have you here...Glad you could make it...sit on down, it's good you were able to make your way over here to us.""   
  
And for about a full minute he kept just reiterating multiple versions of that so that everyone is just staring at me for maximum amount of time possible.  
  
Just really drawing as much attention to me being late to the meeting as possible.   
  
I genuinely felt like I might cry. Everyone was staring at me. I'm not normally really bothered by that sort of thing, but I actually really was. I've been under so much stress lately. And it felt so unfair.   
  
So he kept carrying on with multiple contrived variations of that (I sense maybe he was trying to elicit an apology from me).   
  
But finally I mumbled something like ""I actually got here early. \[Principal's assistant\] said she was going to tell me where the meeting was being held.""   
  
Then I sat there seething. I avoided eye-contact with the principal's assistant and I wondered if she could sense the rays of rage emanating from me.   
  
First, for failing to tell me where the meeting was being held, and second for not defending me during the passive-aggressive scolding.   
  
A few minutes later the principal's assistant apparently remembered that she also forgot to tell The History Teacher about the meeting.   
  
He is the other vegan on the faculty. And I suspect that he also has moral OCD. And he has an extremely type A personality.   
  
And he always arrives to work very very early.  
  
So the principal's assistant gets up and goes to The History Teacher's classroom to get him.   
  
And the history teacher comes into the meeting...also late. Later than me. Having not been informed of the meeting's location.  
  
And the school owner does not make any kind of scene about his late arrival whatsoever. Not even a word to him. 

I felt like I was burning up. With rage, and with the need to conceal my rage, and with embarrassment that my rage might be apparent. 

I was not very productive today. 

...But I fear that cannot really be blamed on this incident. I had the entire day to work but I was very distracted. Anxiety mostly, I think. Lesson planning felt daunting. 

The last week of last semester I did not get to do any lesson planning because my son was sick and accompanied me to work every day. 

...You can see that I'm making a very professional impression, all the way around. 

My son was home with my husband all day today. My husband was not too impressed to hear that I had given my son coffee ahahaa... 

Wow, I am not looking forward to work tomorrow. ",1,1767676478.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹

I throw on my shoes, my shirt, and struggle to make myself brush my teeth.  I loath how it feels to drag the bristles against them.  And then I'm off.  It's not that I hate my job, but it definitely is not my greatest passion in this whole wide world.  I work at a small town coffee shop, Bleu Mountain Coffee.  It is cute and truly has some of the greatest drinks and cakes that I have ever had.  I am beyond grateful that I can now make my own versions of these things at home, but the job is draining.  Watching friends, families, and couples come in and enjoy each other's company each day while I work eight to ten hours a day and not have a single conversation outside of saying, “Hi, what can I get you today?”  

Regardless, I clock in like clockwork, plaster a fake smile to my face, and stab myself as I attach my name tag to my shirt.  “Fuck!  What a way to start the day.”  I mutter to myself as I rub the spot on my upper chest that I had pricked.  Shaking my head I make my way onto the floor in front of the register and wait for all of the morning gremlins to walk in and order their morning magic in a cup.

As the morning drags on and my smile fights gravity another man walks in.  I sigh a bit as I lift my gaze and lips to greet him only for my mask to completely slip when I look him in the eyes.  This has to be the beginning of a bad joke.  Ten am on a Tuesday the devil walks into a coffee shop.  My face twitches as I force myself to behave normal-ish.  The man in front of me looks exactly as the devil did in my meditation.  This man seems mildly amused by my current reaction to him.

“Could I please have whatever you feel is good this morning?  The only thing I want is for it to be hot.”  The man says.  I just nod my head stiffly and begin to do my thing, running on muscle memory at this point because what else am I to do?  I know what I did last night but also who actually believes in this kind of thing happening?  Definitely not me.  There is no way that this man is the devil.  And even if he is… there is no way that the devil is going to be my life long friend.  No way in hell.  But if he is the devil.  God he must think that I am completely and utterly fucking pathetic.

I feel my eye actively twitching as I hand this man his coffee.  I can’t stop my head from throwing itself to the right as well, to my utter embarrassment and frustration.  All he does is smile at me with slight amusement but he remains polite.

“When is your break?”  His question catches me off guard.  I honestly just want this supermodel of a man to leave me alone at this point.  I feel beyond embarrassed at this whole thing which only intensifies when I notice my hands are noticeably  shaking.

“I.  I go on break in about an hour.”  His smile at my words seems dangerous and too bright.

“Perfect, I look forward to the first meeting that I get to have with my new life long friend.”  My eyes snap up to stare at him but he is already walking away to sit at a table in the center of the shop.

“He's hot honey.  Go get him!”  The next person in line, a  sweet older lady, stage whispers to me.  I know that she is a regular but my brain and body are now actively choosing to work against me in every way at this exact moment and I can not remember her name.  So I just offer her an awkward smile as I prep her drink. 

As soon as my break starts I am not dashing, but moving very quickly with a replacement drink for him and a massive cup; of very much not decaf; coffee for me.

He gives me a tight smile as I sit down.  “So Lynn, I will be living with you from now until your death.  You have me as a *friend* officially.”  He speaks with authority, without room for debate.  I don’t know how to respond to him.  When I finally find my words they are small and a bit broken.

“I didn’t think last night was real.”  He raises an eyebrow at me before shaking his head.  His jaw noticeably tightens before he rolls his eyes and looks away from me.

“I thought you were going to be entertaining.  But no, you're just like every other person who sells their soul.”  He moves his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose as his face scrunches, as if he has a headache.  With that he waves me away.

The lump that builds in my throat comes suddenly and without warning.  He was so kind, and now..  He just treated me like I was nothing other than a disappointment.   This is not what I asked for.  I feel tears prick at my eyes as I walk back behind the desk.  This is not what I sold my soul for. 

He stays for my full shift, in that seat.  Never looking at me, talking to all of the women who approach him.  Being charming and kind with them.  I wish I could stop watching.  I shouldn’t be surprised, he is the king of the damned.  I should have just turned to God.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  I want to leave.  Tell my co-workers that I am feeling ill, but that would mean going home with him sooner and I don’t want that either.  Grin and bear it.

We walk to my car together and he slides into the passenger seat with an unnatural amount of grace as I fall into the driver's seat.  The ride is silent, him being uninterested in me and me just being too exhausted and disappointed.  I can’t even play my music.  I wish I was stuck inside my head but ever since the depression hit all of the voices that used to play throughout my mind like twenty tabs left open are all silent.  I occasionally can get one line of thought going again but usually it is just silence.  No more singing, no more thoughts, just the daily drone of what needs done and the muscle memory to do it well enough, sometimes.

As we walk into my apartment it is about four in the evening.  I gesture to my futon in the livingroom, currently rolled up into a couch.

“You can stay there.”  With that, no more words or thoughts I bee line like a zom-bee directly to my room.  All I can do is collapse onto my bed. I am going to take a nap and when I wake up I am going to get my contract back from this entity, and then I will get out of this contract and reclaim my soul.

*Knock, knock*

“You know, maybe you would have more friends if you socialized.”  The condensation in his words mirrors that of my parents.  I force myself to my feet which scream out in protest and stumble my way to the door.  Opening it with what little energy I have left in my bones.

“I want a copy of my contract.”  He looks at me amusedly before making one appear out of thin air into his hand.  Tilting his hand down to me as if to hand it to me but when I try to grab it he does not let go.

“You know, you're not the first to try and get out of your contract.  You made the deal, accept accountability and deal with it.”  I grit my teeth as my temper flairs, tears stabbing at my eyes *again*.

“This is *not* what I asked for.  This might be the treatment I put up with to have a ‘friend’ in the past but no longer.  I am not paying for this bull shit.  I want a real friend, who treats me nicely, and chooses me, and wants to be around me, not obligation.  I wanted it to be you for some crazy reason.  It has been made perfectly clear to me within the few interactions that we have had today that you view me as nothing more than a pathetic excuse for a human and a pathetic excuse for a paycheck.”  With that I snatch the papers from his hand and wave them in the air in front of his face.  He looks at me, eyebrows shooting up his forehead before dropping and a smirk forming on his lips.  I prepare to be mocked for my outburst, to be shamed for being anything other than obedient and happy.

He watches me for a long moment, his smirk still on his lips but somehow less ammused.

“This arrangement,” he says finally, “is not what I expected.”  I don’t know how to respond, but he continues before I have to worry about that.  “I misjudged you. I have treated you as if you are already mine. That was… inefficient.”  

What he has just said stings but I stare hard at the center of his forehead without a word as he continues.  He exhales sharply through his nose, irritation flashing across his face.

“I will amend my behavior, not because you are owed anything — but because the contract requires my participation. And because,” his jaw tightens, “you will not tolerate anything less than *friendship*.”

He holds out his hand, smiling like the perfect gentleman as if he didn’t just rip me to shreds.  “Im Lucifer.  I hope that we can become closer within the next few decades and move past my blunder.”  A tear falls against my will as I take his hand and shake it.  His words are in no way reassuring, all I can hope in this moment is that at the very least if he will try  to fake it well enough that maybe I can pretend that I actually think he likes me for me and that is why he is sticking around.

Context: This happened back in December 2025 after my dad passed away due to heart failure. Let’s call my mom L and my dad’s sibling S.

When my dad was hospitalized and struggling to breathe, L was there with S. L said that S hugged her and told her he wouldn’t leave her side, which made L uncomfortable, so she stepped away because she was surprised by what happened. At that time, the setup was that L was being dropped off and picked up by S because our house was far from the hospital, and my dad had entrusted L to S’s care.

Fast forward to my dad’s wake: L and S are often together, which seemed normal because S was helping L manage guests and family coming to pay their respects. L later told me that one time they were alone at the wake, S held her hand and said he wouldn’t leave them (referring to my mom and her children). We didn’t think much of it initially, assuming he was just trying to comfort L.

We thought this would end after my dad’s cremation, but it didn’t. As of today, January 5, many things have happened. S, who is married and whose wife is pregnant, goes to L’s house almost every night to chat and have coffee. One time they drank alcohol while watching Netflix, and L told me S tried to kiss her—but she didn’t feel anything romantic or spark anything. They also hold hands, but not in public—only when S is at L’s house at night. Twice, S has stayed overnight at L’s house, the most recent being last night when he was drunk and wanted to sleep there.

It’s a very messy situation, and I’m not sure what to feel or think. What do you think?

Previous Attempts: None—I honestly don’t know how to process this situation.

I wanted to say ""yeah, just like your husband's dick!""

I am 25F, live alone, and I don’t ask for anything from my parents throughout the year but recently the past few years around christmas / my birthday I have needed or wanted something really bad that I wouldn’t necessarily buy for myself (ex. grocery gift cards, PJ set, a nice coat, a dutch oven, new slippers - are just some of the things I would have loved to receive over the years).

I’ve noticed that every time I try to hint or just flat out tell my parents about something I’d like / need, they either come back with “darn we already bought gifts” or “nooo we couldn’t possibly give you gift cards/money”. So I stopped asking and just let them get me whatever they want.

Now, my issue comes with the fact that my parents, without fail, every single year for the past 8 years, have gotten me a bunch of gifts that i literally CANNOT use. And I’m talking they will spend anywhere between $200-300 on me per occasion but buy things like bath bombs (i only have a shower), a HUGE zen garden (I live in the tiniest apartment, they know what it looks like, i did keep this one but they know I have absolutely nowhere to put it, as nice as it is), a set of extremely flamboyant neon pink and green socks, a milk frother (I have never drank coffee), etc. One time I even told them i was running out of my favourite perfume so I asked for it for my birthday and even sent them the link and exact name, they got me MALE COLOGNE. Yes these are nice gifts, but they don’t suit me at all and i genuinely do not have space for these things. 

I *truly* don’t mean to be ungrateful I SWEAR. But it gets to a point where I genuinely wish they would get me just ONE thing i want instead of wasting their money on a bunch of smaller things that I legitimately have to give away because I can’t use them. I know they mean well and want me to be able to open a bunch of gifts but sometimes it feels like it’s just for “show” (they love to post on FB/IG about how full the christmas tree is). They love to brag about the quantity of gifts and even say “can you believe we bought all of this in just 2 hours” (yes, yes I can believe it actually). 
 
I feel like crap when I’ve spent serious time thinking about what to get everyone just to feel like they grab random things to wrap and give me. It’s not about a tit for tat thing either, I just want to feel appreciated, I would literally rather get nothing and just be happy watching them open their gifts than have to sit there and force a smile every time i get a bathbomb that I have to give away. I’m seriously talking like they could give me hand cream and i’d be over the moon. 

It sucks even more because I see a lot of my friend’s parents will legit ask them what they want for christmas and they will give them just that, ONE or TWO things that they want and maybe a few small stocking stuffers like lip balm and gum.

I crocheted a few hearthstone coasters for him. The right-side up is going the wrong direction, but there’s no other way to do it with crochet. 

Additionally, I did hand spin the yarn myself with my spinning wheel. (Because crocheting isn’t weird enough.) It was made with white and blue merino fiber. 

I know he loves his coffee in the morning and I like making stuff that’s useful - so I figured it was a good choice! He doesn’t know that I asked Reddit so if he sees this I may be hiding lol. 🫢 But updates were wanted, so here ya go!

Same dress, different energy. Suddenly it’s coffee runs, wandering, sitting too long somewhere cozy, and feeling like yourself instead of “styled.” I think the best outfits are the ones that fit into your day, not the other way around.

1q59hj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1q59hj3/the_heavy_weight_hulk/,The Heavy Weight Hulk,"Chicago’s South Side had a rhythm that never slept. Sirens stitched the night together. Streetlights flickered like tired eyes. On the blocks west of Englewood—where brick two-flats leaned into each other and murals fought to keep hope loud—people learned early how to walk fast, speak careful, and love hard.

That was where **Amara Kostopoulos-Johnson** grew up.

Her street sat between rival corners claimed by the **Iron Kings** and the **Red Ash Crew**, gangs born from poverty, broken schools, and promises nobody kept. Everybody knew when to stay inside. Everybody knew which alley not to cut through. And everybody knew Amara—short, broad-shouldered, quiet, always shadowboxing in the vacant lot with taped fists and a busted jump rope.

She was the youngest in a family that carried more history than money.

# Roots Forged by Work and Survival

Amara’s family story began far from Chicago, crossing oceans in the 1960s.

Her **grandfather, Nikos Kostopoulos**, came from Thessaloniki, Greece, a dockworker whose hands were permanently scarred from rope burns and rusted steel. He believed work was sacred.  
Her **grandmother, Eleni Kostopoulos**, stitched clothes in a factory by day and cleaned offices by night, humming old Greek hymns that somehow survived the Atlantic.

They settled in Chicago chasing stability—and found struggle instead.

Their son, **Dimitri Kostopoulos**, Amara’s father, became a **steel mill worker**, carrying molten heat home in his bones. Her **mother, Lorraine Johnson-Kostopoulos**, an African American woman whose family roots stretched through Mississippi and Detroit, worked as a **night-shift ER nurse**, saving lives while the city burned around her.

Amara’s siblings followed the same path of heavy responsibility:

* **Marcus**, the oldest, became a **CTA bus mechanic**, keeping the city moving.
* **Helena**, sharp-tongued and brilliant, worked as a **public defender**, fighting a system that swallowed kids whole.
* **Theo**, a high-school history teacher, taught Black and immigrant history like it was armor.

And Amara?

Amara wanted to fight.

Not for chaos.  
For control.

Her idol was **Claressa Shields**—a champion who proved power didn’t ask permission. Amara watched old fights on her cracked phone, memorizing footwork, head movement, patience. She trained every morning before school and every night after homework—pushups, shadowboxing, running stairs in the building until her lungs burned.

Still, her body stayed stubbornly human.

“You got heart,” Marcus told her one night. “But heart don’t stop bullets.”

Amara didn’t answer. She just wrapped her hands tighter.

# Bloodline of a Forgotten God

The family had stories—half whispered, half laughed off.

Eleni used to say, “We are not just workers. We are survivors of gods.”  
Dimitri claimed their bloodline traced back to **Kratos**, son of **Pallas and Styx**, the embodiment of strength itself.

Nobody believed it.

Except Amara.

One night, after a long day dodging gang tension and a longer night of training, Amara collapsed onto her bed. Her room shook—not violently, but with weight. The air thickened like a storm holding its breath.

A figure emerged from the shadows.

Tall. Scarred. Radiating gravity.

**Kratos.**

Not the monster of legend—but a weary god who had watched humanity carry burdens meant for gods.

>

Amara sat up, heart pounding. “Why me?”

Kratos looked at her taped fists. Her bruises. Her neighborhood.

>

He offered her a choice:  
Become his **Avatar**—his living embodiment of strength in a world drowning in violence.

No throne.  
No worship.  
Only responsibility.

Amara didn’t hesitate.

“I accept.”

# Morning of Broken Stone

The next morning, Amara woke early.

She stepped into the bathroom—and when she turned the faucet, the porcelain sink cracked beneath her grip. The mirror shattered when she leaned too close. The tile crumbled under her bare feet.

Downstairs, she reached for the table to steady herself.

The oak snapped in half like cardboard.

Silence.

Her family stared.

Lorraine dropped her coffee.  
Dimitri crossed himself.  
Eleni whispered an old prayer.

“What did you do?” Helena asked.

Amara swallowed. “I became what I was supposed to be.”

# The First Stand

Gunfire erupted outside before questions could follow.

The Iron Kings and Red Ash Crew clashed in the street—automatic fire ripping through parked cars.

Without thinking, Amara ran.

Bullets struck her chest and fell to the ground like rain.

She reached a gunman, grabbed his weapon—and **snapped it in half** with two fingers.

Another charged her.

She tapped him once.

He flew across the street and embedded in a brick wall.

The fighting stopped.

The gangs ran.

Neighbors watched from windows, mouths open.

A kid whispered, “She’s like… the Hulk.”

Someone else said, “Nah. She’s heavier.”

By morning, the name spread block to block:

**The Heavy Weight Hulk.**

# Knockout or Total Knockout

Amara didn’t hunt gangs.

She stood.

She protected.

She boxed professionally under supervision, knocking opponents out of the ring without permanent harm—always pulling power at the last second.

Her catchphrase echoed through gyms and streets alike:

**“Knockout… or Total Knockout.”**

Even the Juggernaut, watching from afar, felt the shift. This wasn’t rage-strength.

This was **measured force**.

Kratos smiled from wherever forgotten gods watched.

Chicago’s South Side stood taller.

Not because fear ruled the streets.

But because strength finally had a conscience.

And her family?

They stood beside her.

Not as legends.

But as proof that even gods need communities to make their power mean something.",1,1767675706.0,MarvelFanStory,0,1.0,False
1q59gnq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q59gnq,Do you get bored on a sailboat for 5 days? (What a 24-hour cycle actually looks like).,"I often get asked if people get ""cabin fever"" or run out of things to do after a few days on a boat. As a charter organizer for Nomad Sailors, I find it fascinating how your perception of time shifts when you are anchored in the Caribbean. Life on board has a very specific rhythm that is hard to explain until you live it, but I’ll try to describe a typical day so you know what to expect in the San Blas Islands (Guna Yala).

The morning starts early, not because of an alarm clock, but because of the sun. You usually wake up around 6:30 or 7:00 AM. The boat is completely silent, and the water is often flat as a mirror. This is my favorite time of day. You step out onto the deck with your coffee while the crew starts prepping breakfast, which is usually fresh fruit and eggs. There is no rush. This is when most people jump in the water for the first time, often before they’ve even brushed their teeth.

Around noon is when we usually move. Sailing in San Blas isn’t like crossing the Atlantic; these are short hops of one or two hours between islands. We hoist the sails and head toward the outer reefs, like the Dutch Cays. During the sail is the perfect time to read a book or sit on the bow nets watching for dolphins. When we arrive at the new anchorage, the water color shifts drastically to that electric blue you see in the photos, and the vibe changes from ""travel"" to ""exploration.""

The afternoon is dedicated to active downtime. We drop the kayaks or paddleboards and head to the nearby uninhabited islands. There are no shops or bars, just palm trees and coral. It is total disconnection. By the time you get back to the boat for dinner, the lack of light pollution hits you. Without cities nearby, the sky fills with stars in a way you will never see on land. Most guests are completely wiped out by 9:00 PM, exhausted from the sun and the sea, and rocked to sleep by the gentle movement of the catamaran.",1,1767675644.0,SanBlasIslands,0,1.0,False

1q59fm0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q59fm0,"Enjoyed Chiang Mai Thailand, with a little bit of Chiang Rai","I miss the euphoric feeling of exploring a different country where no one knows you, plus yung excitement & at the same time uneasy feeling mainly because of the language barrier when ordering food, doing laundry and buying things/groceries. 

  
I miss the toasted sandwich and the pickled mangoes sa 7-11. Sobrang kalma ng Chiang Mai for me and this is my first Thailand trip. Never visited BKK pa kasi I usually shy away from cities, feeling umay na kasi sa Manila. I really love exploring nature din. But hopefully this year makapag Bangkok naman.

  
This was my first time testing a digital nomad life, SOLO outside Manila. I work at night, tapos pagka-out ko doon ako nag e-explore until noon. 

  
I lost count of the Buddhist temples na napuntahan ko.

I joined tours na lang kasi nahirapan ako i-DIY, plus solo din kasi:



\*\*CHIANG MAI\*\*

\- booked a Temple Walking Tour around Chiang Mai via AirBNB Experience Php 988

\- hiked Wat Pha Lat then explored Doi Suthep at night (booked via Get Your Guide). The gold temple looked magical at night. I was just in awe. P1,500

\- Thai Cooking school (booked via Airbnb Experience) I learned how to cook Khao Soi, pad thai and papaya salad! Germans ung classmates ko tapos we explored the wet market at namili ng ingredients. Eto talaga mga trip ko sa ibang bansa; exploring markets and groceries! PHP 1,621

\- Jing Jai Market - ang cucute ng mga clothes dito locally made by small individual businesses, ang ganda ng mga tela. Around 1k up kasi pure cotton, pure linen ung iba. Dami din food options kaso di ko na naabutan kasi hapon na ko dumating. Be early here, alam ko tuwing weekend lang sila open. 

\- Coconut Market - small lang ung place with coco trees planted sa gitna surrounded by small food stalls and clothing, etc.

  
\- Day Tour DOI INTHANON NATIONAL PARK via Click2GoThailand Php 1,800 - grabe immersion ko sa nature dito. One of the best tours for me.

  
\*\*Day trip to CHIANG RAI\*\* (booked via Klook Php 1,300) - more temples visited

  
Solo DIY to MAE KAMPONG. I enjoyed the food trip here and chill sa coffee shop by the river. Nakaka-heal ng soul jusko. Nagbook lang ako ng van via Facebook! 

  
On my last day, I went to Huay Tueng Thao Reservoir sa area ng Chiang Mai university. Ang sarap mag muni-muni and jog dito.

  
Babalikan, Chiang Mai! Kulang pa yung coffee shop hopping ko dito given na they are Thailand's coffee capital. I got to take home coffee beans naman. Hindi pa din enough yung 3 weeks. Parang bet ko tumira dito. ",35,1767675561.0,FilipinoTravel,3,0.98,False
1q59ffz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1q59ffz/there_are_2_sides_of_me/,There are 2 sides of me,"20s M—My whole life I have been like a golden child, and eventually a well known person in my community. I became a doctor, I am that one kid who has been praying in masjid since childhood where the only other people were old people (they even had a congregational dua for me when I had an accident) I have never used any bad language cuz it’s just not a part of my dictionary (my mom was very scary when it came to that), I am that one kid who shows up in funerals of our community, also in my community where other kids have either been caught doing drugs or driving rashly it just amplifies as me being the good kid in the society that I live in. My parents are delusionaly optimistic about me to be someone who has never done anything bad, I would be watching movies on my iPad but they’d believe that I am studying for my exams.

But in reality I have a secret side of me that people can’t even imagine it exists, I have done drugs that no one can imagine, I have had addictions (like corn, nicotine) that no one can imagine, I have done some really stupid things like almost getting myself killed or getting caught by the police. All of these were due to friends from childhood that grew up in a different direction but regardless when I meet them I do fall into actions that I never associate with myself. I have done these things so much that I don’t even feel guilty about them anymore and it’s become a normal secret life of mine. 

For me it became quite easy that I need to leave the “haram me” and embrace the Me that everyone knows but inorder to do that I had to leave a lot of my friends behind, I did that and I did make new friends who can’t in a million years imagine my past and I don’t behave like the haram me at all so no one can imagine that side of me. I used the analogy of sins kept in secret are forgiven by God (that’s why this is also a throwaway account)

Now I shouldn’t be putting this on others but it’s true that the haram me only emerges when I am with my old friends from school (who back in the day were all innocent and normal) and I have lost contact with all of them except 1 and I can’t lose contact with him cuz he is pretty close to me. But he did grew out to be way too haram like the body count type of guy, but I’m as close to him as he is to me.

In the end I am stuck in this hypocritical state where my innocent friends would talk about over dosing on “coffee” and in my head I would be thinking of overdosing on actual drugs that I did, My new friends would be talking about how bad a cigarette is where I have smoked all sorts of things, I have this unsettling feeling that people around me would never understand me because they can’t relate to me. I maintained two distinct images and every time I get to meet my haram self (now it’s down to like once or twice a year) I embrace him I remember him and I acknowledge his existence.

Is it possible that I take the haram Me forever and for the sake of real Me I shorten his existence to once or twice a year forever. This might get shorter with time as I get married and everything. Also another thing was can I hide this haram me from my spouse? No one from real me’s life can even imagine the haram me exists. Can this go on forever? I only have 1 friend left that connects me to my past, that understands me top to bottom and I don’t wanna loose that friend.",2,1767675547.0,MuslimLounge,2,1.0,False

1q59ac0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1q59ac0/my_story/,My story,"The soul of a child is formed by their memories and the innocence they feel toward the world. So much of our personalities are shaped during this time, and it can follow us into adulthood.

While others watched cartoons and giggled, content in the knowledge that nothing could hurt them, some are not so lucky. Innocence can be taken away so easily. I was one of those children. It started with an act of unimaginable betrayal. One of the joys of being a child is knowing that your family loves you and would never hurt you. At least, that's how it should be.

We were taken in by our grandparents at a few months old when our birth mother, who had three other boys to raise, could no longer care for us. As a twin born prematurely, I was born with a brain hemorrhage, pituitary dwarfism, autism, strabismus, Tourette’s, and ADHD, as well as a tendency to drag my left side. I was given a heart monitor at one point. My sister got it worse. She's in a wheelchair and can only use two fingers. I was already vulnerable. I had a very bad stutter and so I couldn’t really talk, so I clung to any measure of affection. For example, we had a babysitter named Shaina who lived across the road from us, and I attached myself to her at the hip. She became an adored presence, especially in the years ahead, and I don't know if she knows just how much she meant to me.

By five, I loved to read by myself. While my sister struggled to learn to read but did better at other subjects, a few years later, I was reading at an eighth-grade level. By all accounts, I was a happy child. It’s funny how quickly that can be ripped away.

In our old house in Washington, we had a garage, a weirdly paved room with a couch and a TV. This is where it started, where it all went to hell. I have an older half-brother, by a few years; I will call him Ryan. It started very slowly. A game would be played—a game I didn’t really enjoy because I didn’t like the dark. I never did. I still struggle with it now. There was one monster he created called the French Monster, which can give you a very good indication of what happened. Regardless, it went on for a very long time. Eventually, one evening, my sister and I were called into my dad’s office where they proceeded to ask us questions. Was this done? Did this happen? Is this happening?

I was the only one that it had happened to. Naturally, one would assume that would be the finish of it, that this person would never be allowed back, even if he was a couple of years older. But that is not the case. He was punished and sent back home. Within a few months, he was back, and it continued. Naturally, I just shut up. Why bother telling? It was clear no punishment was going to happen. And of course, at that age, I didn’t really understand what it was, but I knew I didn’t like it. So I would just go into my happy place.

I now know this to be called dissociation. You leave your body for a bit, hoping it will end soon. Around this time, I met a wonderful woman named Louise at a birthday party for my dying aunt Julie, and as fate would have it, she was hired as our cleaner. She saw something in me as needing love and proceeded to take me on the weekends occasionally for sleepovers. She was a family friend, the best friend of my aunt Courtney from childhood. And she and I became very, very close, and still are. She became my rock. I owe her my life and everything I’ve become. She is family in all that matters.

At some point, two of the brothers went down south to be with their father, and my birth mother moved into my own bedroom. I was moved into what our family called the laundry room. Naturally, where was Ryan to go but with me? I took the bottom bunk, and he took the top. Ryan was an unhealthy child, so he was already nearing 200 pounds nightly. I would pray he didn’t break it and crush me. Needless to say, it continued. This time he added physical abuse. It started with a practice punch to the gut. My dad gave me a very nice blue chest to store my treasures in, for I collected rocks when I would go rock hunting with my aunt Tracy, or I would collect books that I liked about history. Ryan would shove me into it, and he would lock it, threatening to let me suffocate. In my mind, I couldn’t understand why he hated me. Was I not nice to him? I couldn’t figure out what the difference was between my sister and me.

He spent years psychologically abusing me as well, telling me no one would want me around. I would never make a friend because of my stutter. They would all leave, and I would be left alone because I was a freak. Being homeschooled meant the only friends I could possibly make were at church, and that didn’t feel comfortable.

I tried to find ways to make him care about me, but it didn’t work. I had another half-brother, older than Ryan, who would come over, and eventually he tried to teach me to fight. I was 10 by this point, and what did it matter against a six-foot monster? No, all it did was get me choked. Still, I didn’t tell anyone the whole truth. All my grandparents would tell him was, “Don’t roughhouse so hard, you’re bigger,” not, “We don’t trust you because of what you did.”

We would take yearly vacations to the Oregon coast or Ohanapecosh, and I remember one day Ryan pulled me while my other brother pushed my sister. He led me down a trail and then proceeded to teach and show me something that in my mind was horrible. As I stood there frozen, he enjoyed it. Naturally, he stopped suddenly when people walked up and questioned why we were alone.

At this point, I was lashing out, having fits—meltdowns that they couldn’t explain, which I had always had. I would lash out and hit people and scream. Looking back on it, I lashed out because I was afraid and I couldn’t express what was happening to me. Because some part of me still loved my brother, I didn’t want him to get in trouble.

By then, he had moved back to Spokane, so I only had to see him during the summer. My birth mother opened up a coffee shop, and so my grandmother would take me on trips to go stay with them and help her with this business that she loaned her money for. He was 16, almost 17, by this point and in high school. I argue that at this point he knew exactly what he was doing, and he knew it was wrong. What he did during one of these trips scarred me deeply. I was reading a book in the bedroom where I was sleeping. The door opened. Ryan, at this point, was an Xbox person and worked at McDonald’s. He was able to buy things and had bought a gun. He pointed it at me in between my legs and said, “If you move or talk, I’ll shoot.”

Naturally, in my mind, all I saw was a gun. All I had heard about guns was that they kill. Naturally, I obeyed, and he locked me in the room. The phone was right there. I could’ve called the cops, but something scared me. What if I wasn’t believed? After all, I wasn’t protected the first time, so I stayed silent, held it in, and wrote it down in a journal. My only respite from seeing him was summer camp, and I loved it. I had been going for years by this point.

By my 13th year, I realized I was either gay or bisexual, though part of me feared that it was as a result of what happened to me as a child. My grandmother, a Catholic, was horrified. She asked me, “Did I make him do it to me? Did I enjoy it?” It was the worst thing I’ve ever been asked. I had, of course, been brought to a counselor by my mother. But after one asked me if I orgasmed, I neglected to go again.

Finally, one day when Ryan was staying over, I brought my journal to my mother and showed it to her. She was, of course, horrified, and I’m not sure if she really believed me. But she kept saying she would’ve protected me if she had known. My other half-brother by this point had informed me that the reason Ryan hates me is because I was gay, which astounded me.

I grew up. I finally went to high school part-time, and to my delight, I made friends, but to my sadness, only one has stayed. Another problem arose. As a result of the abuse, I was hypersexual. It made friendships with males extremely hard because anytime they looked at me, I thought they were flirting, and I had a problem making inappropriate comments. At one point, I began to self-harm, trying to get someone to pay attention to the pain I was in. It did little good. Around my 18th year, I attempted suicide twice. I was told, “Next time, try harder,” by my family.

I was kicked out twice when I brought up what happened to me, and I moved in with Louise, who took care of me twice—first when I was 16 and the second when I was 19. This was hard because she had to take care of her older mother, whom I lovingly called Grandma Betty, who has long since passed away. By this point, I didn’t see Ryan anymore. I was finally safe physically, but not mentally. I eventually moved back in with my grandparents because I knew Louise was tired, and she deserved to enjoy her life, and it was for the best. We have since grown so much closer, and we are going on a trip in October—21 years of friendship.

I restarted college and started acting in plays. I didn’t make very many friends, just people I sat with. I received an acting award nomination and made it to the second round—the first person in 30 years at my college. I was happy. I was 19 years old, and even though I had crippling self-doubt about making friends, after my twenty-first birthday, I met two people in the same year who made me realize I could absolutely have friends, and to my delight, they have stayed. I usually go back once a year to see them.

The happiest moment occurred when I was 24. At almost 25, I met a beautiful British person on Twitter. He’s become my best friend. He’s brilliant, utterly mad, a brilliant guitarist and writer. And I cannot express what that has meant to me. I never thought I could be best friends with men. This is the first friendship where I felt instantly safe. I owe him a great debt because he’s changed my life for the better, and he has shown me there’s so much more to life. He’s a beautiful, kind person, and utterly selfless. I wish there were more people like him.

Ryan by this point has married; he’s had two kids. I’ve never confronted him. He has gone on to fulfill his dreams as a train operator and makes $130,000 a year. I have to deal with his visits yearly when he brings the kids. I’m 26 now. There are moments where I still struggle with my anger. I’m holding two jobs, which I’m very proud of. I’m still in major pain day after day, and part of me knows I’ll never be okay. It’s hard to forgive someone who shows no remorse, as he is the one who should be coming to me and saying what he did to me was horrible. Some people have said I should confront him, but where’s the safety in that? All I know is I will probably never forgive Ryan. I don’t feel any love for him as far as he is concerned. He still shows his hatred and glares at me whenever he sees me, but I have no desire to be near him as much as possible.

Even though I question if I’m a good person, there are still parts I like about myself. I can write beautifully. I can retain information better than most. I was reading at a ninth-grade level by the time I was 12 and a half. I read a 1,000-page novel in a week when I was eight years old. I’m a good friend, I hope. I try to be brave for others, and I love bomb to try to keep them from hurting.

Part of me wonders, would I have met my beautiful friends if I had not become the person that I am today by going through hell? Did I go through this so that I can help others not have to go through the same ordeal? I have a spirit that refused to be extinguished by the hatred and abusive horrors done to me. I am brave. I survived everything, and no longer am I searching for someone to fix me or to love me. My journey now is luxuriating in the love I have longed for and finally found.",1,1767675136.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

Now that the busy time is over and the restaurant is quiet, we used to call these the “Booth Months”. Time to sit down with your regulars in the booths and take the time to build relationships.

So, I’m going to give you what I’d do, as I coach restaurants today, interview tons of guests on our podcast and write a ton about this industry.

This should be your busiest time of the year, when you have time now to work on your business but no one taught this to us. Here’s what I’d do today:

# Sunday Afternoon

I’d start by pulling out my phone and updating our Google Business Profile. Twenty minutes. Three photos of our best dishes. Natural light from the window. No fancy setup. Just food that makes people stop scrolling.

Then I’d sit down with coffee and read every review from December. All of them. I’d respond to every single one. The five-star reviews get a personal thank you with their name. The three-star reviews get acknowledged with what we’re changing.

Next, I’d open our POS system and look at the last 30 days. What are our top five sellers? What has the best margins? What did servers tell me people asked for that we don’t have? I’d write these down on paper.

I’d walk my restaurant from the front door to the bathroom like I’ve never been here before. What’s the first impression? What’s broken or dirty? What would confuse a first-timer? I’d make a list of ten things.

Then I’d fix one thing right now. Today. Maybe it’s the flickering light above table seven. Maybe it’s the menu description nobody understands. Maybe it’s the stack of boxes visible from the dining room. One thing gets fixed before dinner service.

Before the shift starts, I’d talk to my team for ten minutes. We’re trying something this week. Every server asks every table one question: “How did you hear about us?” We write down the answers. I need to know if Instagram works or if it’s all word of mouth.

During service tonight, I’d sit down with three regulars. Not just stop by the table. Actually sit for five minutes. I’d ask them: What keeps you coming back? What should we never change? If you could change one thing, what would it be?

I’d listen. I’d write it down. I wouldn’t defend or explain. Just listen.

Before I go home, I’d spend fifteen minutes planning tomorrow. What’s the one thing I’m doing Monday to make this place better? Maybe I’m rewriting three menu descriptions. Maybe I’m calling five customers who haven’t been in lately. Maybe I’m filming thirty seconds of our kitchen for social media.

One thing. That’s it.

# The Next 56 Days

This is your window. Eight weeks when you have time to work **ON** the business instead of just IN it. While your competitors complain about January being slow, you’re building.

**Week one**, you’re fixing the basics. Photos. Reviews. Small repairs. Staff training.

**Week two**, you’re talking to customers. Real conversations. What do they actually want?

**Week three**, you’re testing menu changes. New descriptions. One seasonal item. Better photos.

**Week four**, you’re improving the experience. Fixing friction points. Training on hospitality. Creating signature moments.

**Week five**, you’re building your marketing. One story. Five social posts. One local partnership.

**Week six**, you’re launching something new. A weekly special. A referral program. A VIP list for regulars.

**Week seven**, you’re doubling down on what worked. More of the good stuff. Less of what didn’t move the needle.

**Week eight**, you’re planning the next cycle. What did we learn? What stays? What changes?

By March, you’re not hoping for a better year. You already built one. One day at a time. One small improvement at a time.

Most restaurants will waste these weeks. They’ll wait. They’ll hope. They’ll do nothing.

You’re not most restaurants.

So what are you actually going to do this Sunday afternoon?

I’ve been obsessing over simple binary choices lately (Coffee vs. Tea, Dark Mode vs. Light Mode, etc.).

I had a hypothesis: Can an algorithm predict random facts about a person based solely on their answers to these trivial ""This vs. That"" questions?

To test this, I built a service that runs calculations on user choices to see if there are hidden correlations in the data. Basically, I'm trying to see if knowing your preference for ""Pineapple on Pizza"" can actually help a model predict other random demographic facts or habits.

It’s a fun side project/experiment, but I’ve put some work into the backend logic.

I’d love for you guys to try it out and roast the predictions (or the UI).

A little over a year ago, I (31 M) met my best friend Amy (31 F) at a bar. We instantly hit it off - she’s funny, smart, full of life, and is a cosplay model, used to be a pretty famous one too - but more importantly, we felt safe knowing that there was no romantic component, as I had feelings for another girl at the time, while she’s been in a toxic situationship with Chris (42 M). Amy’d been on and off with Chris for a little bit before meeting me, and while she’s desperately in love with him, she’s started to realize he plays mind games a lot to diminish her, and that the divorce he’d told her he was going through when they met has been going on longer than it should have. She's tried to confront him about it, but he's an expert at gaslighting her and keeping her on the hook.

Anyway, for one year, we spent our weekends going out and dancing, drinking, seeing shows, having a good time. On my end, I eventually fell out of touch with the girl I had that crush on, yet still never wanted to consider Amy in that way - even if there were feelings there, she’d had a habit of guys wanting to be friends with her solely to try and hook up with her, and that had never been my goal. She's my best friend, that's a fulfilling relationship in its own right, and I never considered it or her as anything else. This all changed on New Year’s.

We had plans to go see When Harry Met Sally… at a local theater, watch a football game, and then go drinking and dancing. When I arrived to pick her up, she gave me my belated Christmas gift, a thrift store version of the sweater Harry wears in the movie. That night, she wore this terrific dress I’d complimented her on before, and after some bar hopping and a few drinks, midnight came and we decided to be each other’s midnight kiss. Once our lips met, she kind of went for it, and, in a release of emotion, we fully kissed. When we separated, she smiled and said “What took you so long?” and admitted that she’d wanted to do that for a month (she later admitted it had been two, she was just underselling it). Later, when we tried to find our coats and realized ours got knocked over into a big pile, she started to panic (she does sometimes if she thinks she lost something while drunk), and was worried that this was “ruining the magic.”

I was, ultimately, just shocked she was this into me. This girl is a model and gets hit on every time we go out, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I’d been fighting these feelings for a couple of months. We went back to her place and cuddled for the rest of the night, nothing more, and decided we’d talk everything through the following day at dinner (we already had plans to watch the Stranger Things finale and then grab a bite to eat). While at dinner, as we talked, it became clear to her that, while her feelings for me were real, she was still in too deep with Chris, and while she knew she was unhappy, she didn’t feel she could leave him yet; and that, considering how confused and messed up she felt because of him and that relationship, she was afraid trying to get involved with her best friend would ruin the friendship and cost her the “best and truest friend she has.” I laid out how I felt but assured her that this wouldn’t ruin the friendship, she wouldn’t lose me, and everything would be fine.

Over the last few days, things have been fairly, I guess the best word is weird? Not on my end, entirely (don’t get me wrong though, I have been kinda mixed up - I hadn’t realized I’d been bottling up emotions until it came uncorked and now am feeling everything at once). We’re just kind of stuck between wanting to go back to the way things were when things were fun and flirty and fully feeling the awkwardness of our new reality. We’ve already cancelled a movie night to avoid the tension, and while we tried to meet up to go dancing the other night, it ultimately ended in disaster because of the inner struggle between friend and more (we got in a huge fight, but made up and got coffee the next day).

Ultimately, I’m just trying to figure out what to do for myself right now. I don’t want to lose my best friend over this, and I also want to figure out how to deal with all these added complications to my life. Oh, and to any Redditors planning to sound off in the comments looking to denigrate Amy, you can go to hell. She’s not perfect, and that night out dancing was rough, but she’s normally a ray of sunshine and treats both me and others well.

If it helps, I don’t have a temperature control kettle, I just wait for about 30 seconds after a boil. I typically use light-medium roast coffee out of an oxo conical burr grinder and have been able to get good pour overs with said kettle/grinder combo. Any help is appreciated as I’m very excited to get the hang of it. ",2,1767673856.0,AeroPress,10,1.0,False
1q58sc4,https://i.redd.it/epgpsyxcpnbg1.jpeg,Branching out thanks to this sub,"Relatively new to the brewed coffee world and my experience has been pretty much limited to BT Vienna Roast forever. I’d been wanting to try something new but felt a bit lost with all the options out there.

Spent a good amount of time reading through posts, tiers, recommendations on this sub and finally ordered this sampler set from Kāpikottai. Just tried the Curveball and it smells and tastes amazing (notes of Marigold and dates). Looking forward to trying more of these and learning more along the way. The next one would be Hunkal, heard a lot about it as well. 

Would love to hear any more suggestions - any must-try roasters, specific beans, or styles?

Appreciate the knowledge sharing here. Cheers! ☕️",2,1767673668.0,IndiaCoffee,1,0.75,False
1q58rwg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q58rwg,"All About Ossining: Part 1, The Reservoir.","I live in Ossining, and am a huge fan of Mad Men! I’ve been thinking about doing a series on this sub for a while to showcase  places mentioned in the show. 

For my first entry, the Pleasantville Rd. Reservoir, which the junior league of Tarrytown fights to save with the help of Henry Francis. 

The reservoir is very real, and along that road. The attention to detail on this show is astounding. 

I’m not sure if it was ever under threat like in the show, but if Betty and Co. hadn’t succeeded this lovely park would not be there today. Many small towns across the area have reservoirs that are no longer in use. Tarrytown (of the junior league), being one of them. 

Ossining does not drink this water anymore, but it’s a lovely lakeside park in suburbia. Ossinings water now comes from the croton reservoir, an extremely large reservoir that also feeds NYC at times. 

Any suggestions where I should cover next??

At this rate I’ll probably just end up running into them locally at Walmart. Tonight he called out of work after blabbering on about his work ethic for days because “he almost slipped off the road”. We have about an inch or less of snow and if you’re from Maine you know an inch is not going to keep us from going anywhere. I’ve driven in worse for my Dunkin iced coffee. I’ve seen him on live more in the last 48 hours more than I’ve seen him at work “putting in so much over time”. 

My second point. He continues to say that his job which if you’re from Maine is a wildly known company. I think we all know 1-2 people employed there does not hire anyone with a record. This is completely false. The company is riddled with folks with records, DUIs etc.

She was a liar. The little envelopes of cash I mailed every month went to her. To one of her other little houses. 

""I was helping you save. For after."" 

This was a special courtesy, I suppose reserved for family. 

The first September, I liked my little house. It was old, and the chipped gray paint reminded me of wool. All the brass fixtures had worn from where hands have touched over the years.  
The water dispensed from a well and the mineral smell was pleasant. Couldn't drink it though. I bought all my water in gallon jugs from the convenience store. It was the closest shop for a couple of miles.

When the wind picked up in October, the sound was shallow enough to mistake for the leaves. The house was bordered on all sides by woods and sat behind the road against 80 acres of privately owned preserve.

By Halloween, the sound had picked up and I thought it might've been trick-or-treaters. That night, I kept checking through the blinds over and over. I thought I was going mad because there wasn't a single kid in sight. No chaperones, no bands of teenagers.  
  
By 11 PM, it was only getting louder.

Anxiety got the best of me and I grabbed my keys, threw open the door, ran down the steps, and jumped in my truck. There had to be someone, even though there were no streetlights on that road. About a mile down the road, when I cracked the windows for air, it was clear for the first time.  
  
Like applause in a ballroom, from everywhere.  
Men and women's voices in commending tones, glasses tapping against plate rims.

By the last mile I'd worked myself into partial visibility. My eyes have always watered when nervous. I still hate this about myself. It's like cowardice leaking from my head.  
I nearly parked sideways in the convenience store lot.

""Yeah?"" 

Jesse, the clerk, said. I must've been standing for a moment too long inside the door.

""You don't hear that?""

I asked her before realizing the sound had stopped. 

November 1st, I called my aunt again. She didn't pick up after I'd gotten home the night before. My claims were brushed off as ""holiday spirit after too many spirits,"" after I'd admitted to having a few drinks. We didn't speak again until Thanksgiving. I'd thought with her whimsical nature she'd be more receptive to my story. This frustrated me. I didn't know it yet but I was frustrated for the wrong reasons.

Throughout the month I was beyond shaken. I began to hear it during the daytime. It was inconsistent but more frequent. The first morning that it came, I didn't believe something so dreamlike could happen in the light.  
  
I awoke to cheers outside my window and echoing clacks of string instruments settling against floorboards. I bolted upright and slapped my curtain aside. Nothing was there except for the stretch of grass before the tree line.

By the 16th I called out of work. It was too much to hear it while making coffee and then pretend things were normal. I called out on the 17th too. This was unlike me but my supervisor didn't make things difficult.  
  
During those days I mostly waited. Then moved, then waited. I sat on the couch with the window cracked. Once I heard the applause I stood and put my ear to the sill. It stopped.  
I laid on my bed until it sounded again but once I stepped into the living room, it stopped. When it was quiet for a while, around noon, I went outside and sat on the side-porch steps.

I sat for an hour. The bare branches of the hickory trees clacked together close to the sky, in a wind so gentle. Feeling very settled I concentrated on my pulse, rhythmic and steady.  
The gravel soft and loose under my shoes. It was a rare moment of stillness for me. Contentment.

A sudden gust came and the sound erupted from beyond the trees. So much laughter, from the gut and bottom of the lungs. A crowd erupting in response to what must've been the most outrageous thing ever said. A hundred chairs creaked as if bodies were shifting back and forth, glasses shook as hands slammed down on clothed wooden tables.

I jolted forwards and fell to the dirt from the porch step. The laughter crescendoed. I nearly snapped my neck looking in all directions. At this point, it was the most frightened I'd ever been. Eyes wide, hot and watery. The tears escaped down my cheeks as I scrambled backwards towards my door.
