Cut to noonish. I was walking on curtis between 17th and 18th. Happened to walk by the subject--big mistake apparently that sidewalk is his. Screams profanities at me as I pass him by. Threatens violence at me. I kept my cool but he got inches from my face and I kid you not i was tempted to throw a punch or use my pepper spray, but i did not. 

Continues screaming crap at me as I walk away and then turns his attention at the next folks approaching him. 

Is that new crisis response team on 16th street just making these belligerent people leave 16th street and basically saying: ""ahh job well done. now its everyone else's problem. Theyre not on 16th anymore.""? 

I dunno, kinda ranting just bc this happens too often.

Can we do something about this problem? Should I have done something different? Maybe called some hotline (so that they could make him relocate to another street, I bet)? I dunno, Just kinda disillusioned with the lackluster response/effort the city has for things like this (at least from what ive seen. Man I just want to enjoy downtown).

1kaxlzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1kaxlzp/do_weird_men_approach_you_with_your_dog/,Do Weird Men Approach you with your Dog,"A disturbing number of men use my dog as an excuse to approach me & ask for my number. Even if I wear headphones and sunglasses. 

My dog is tiny and cute, so we get approached a ton. Women and couples are fine, but at least 50 percent of solo men who approach us make things weird. 

It happened more than usual today. I was wearing shorts for the first time in ages, since it was winter forever where I live. 

One guy ran up to us from behind and told me ""you're dog is adorable!"" He asked me questions about my dogs age and name. Then he asked me my name, before telling me I had a beautiful smile and bragging about his job. He asked me for my number so we could go for coffee. I just said I have a BF and started walking faster. And he kept persisting anyway. 

Another man rolled down his car window and said ""awww sooo cute!"" And I turned and said thank you. He replied ""I was talking to you, but the dog too""

Another man (who also had a dog) said we should arrange a playdate. He said he lived nearby, so we could all hang out now if I wanted. 

I've been asked for my number, instagram, even Snapchat (who even uses that now?). All by men who approach with comments about my dog. 

What's weird is they always pretend to be interested in my puppy, before slowly making their true intentions clear. 

Every time I start to think, ""oh this is just a normal, nice guy who loves puppies""....the conversation suddenly gets weird...and I hear about how ""beautiful"" I look (when I objectively look like shit and they approached me from the back so never saw my face initially). Or I'm being asked for social media or my number

1kaxlre,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kaxlre/starbucks_earnings_miss_but_coffee_chain_says_its/,"Starbucks earnings miss, but coffee chain says it’s seeing ‘momentum’ with turnaround","Starbucks on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected earnings and another quarter of same-store sales declines, but the coffee giant said its turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success.

“Our financial results don’t yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a video posted on the company’s website. “We’re testing and learning at speed and we’re seeing changes in our coffeehouses.”

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 41 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected
* Revenue: $8.8 billion, it was not immediately clear how it compared to the $8.82 billion expected

Excluding items, the company earned 41 cents per share.

Net sales rose 2% to $8.8 billion.

Starbucks’ same-store sales fell for its fifth straight quarter. The company’s sales have slumped as consumers in the U.S. and China, its two largest markets, seek cheaper coffee options.

Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting “back to Starbucks” and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience. In October, the company suspended its forecast for fiscal 2025 as it unveiled the early stages of its turnaround strategy.

The company’s global same-store sales fell 1% in its second quarter, fueled by a 2% decline in transactions. In Starbucks’ home market, the traffic decline was even steeper.

U.S. locations saw transactions fall 4%, dragging its same-store sales down by 2%.China’s same-store sales were flat for the quarter, as lower average ticket offset transaction growth.

1kaxlcb,https://i.redd.it/dysfo4bkztxe1.jpeg,Morning Meeting (Rum Old Fashioned),"Long time listener, first time caller here.  

The inspiration for this drink came from my primary career as an engineer in the Merchant Marine.  On most ships we will have a morning meeting where we go over the duties for the day.  During this, most of the team is drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, or both.  This is something I’ve found to be the case among many industries.  I created this drink for my bar in an attempt to provide my guests a peak into what I do when I’m not there serving them drinks.  

Aroma was the primary thing I was going for here.  The smoking of the coffee beans gives the final product a sense of sticking your nose near a fresh cup of coffee and an ash tray – at the same time.  I wanted the actual taste to be bold and sweet by contrast. 

The rum used for this drink is a blend, mainly comprised of Panamanian, Dominican and Trinidadian 12-year rums, with support from our own Boston-made 8-year and finished with a 12-year Jamaican rum.  I have not made it with a different rum before, but what I’d recommend is something bold and sweet with similar notes to a bourbon.  

“Morning Meeting”

2 oz Aged Rum, blended (Bully Boy Distillers Rum Cooperative #1)
1/4 oz turbinado syrup (1:1)
2 dashes Turkish Tobacco bitters
2 dashes Angostura bitters

Smoke old fashioned / single rocks glass over coffee beans.  Combine ingredients in mixing glass.  Stir.  Strain over large cube.  Garnish with candy cigarette dipped in Ango.  Light cigarette and enjoy. ",0,1745957336.0,cocktails,0,0.5,False

*(Thriller/Horror, \~260 words)*

The bells over the café door jangled twice when he stepped inside with a quick stutter, like an echo tripping over itself.  
The smell hit him first: scorched coffee, wet paint, and something sour underneath. He didn’t remember it ever smelling like that.

His eyes caught it immediately on the fourth item down:  
*Wynn’s Special — $5.25*  
He stared.  
*I don’t have a special.*

Behind the counter, a woman in her fifties with a red bandana and an easy smile caught his eye and lit up.  
""Auggie Wynn,"" she said, wiping her hands on her apron like she’d been waiting years. ""Look at you. We were wonderin’ when you’d wander home.""

It scraped something raw inside him. He smiled automatically, the kind you give at funerals, and ordered a black coffee, foregoing small talk.

The woman poured it fresh, humming a tune he couldn’t place. When she turned to ring him up, August glanced back at the blackboard.

The “Wynn’s Special” was gone.

He blinked hard.  
*Just tired from the long drive. Just rattled.*

He paid cash and stepped back out into the sunlight, coffee burning the chill off his palms.

Everywhere he moved, heads turned half a beat late. Smiles arrived too soon or too wide. The street felt too narrow now. The sun too heavy. His name stuck to the air like a scent he couldn’t scrub off. Halfway down the block, he caught himself glancing at the shopfront windows. Watching himself walk. Making sure he was still there.

1kaxiry,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kaxiry/the_inheritance/,The Inheritance,"Hey. I want to share something personal—wrapped in a horror story called The Inheritance.

This piece is fiction, but it’s born from something real. My mother was abused as a child by someone who should have protected her. That trauma didn’t end with her. I was raised in the shadow of what he did—shaped by her pain, her fear, and the ripple effect of surviving something no one should have to.

The Inheritance explores what happens when silence is passed down like a family heirloom. When pain is inherited. When someone finally says, “No more.”

It’s dark. It’s emotional. And yeah—it’s meant to hurt a little. But if you’ve lived with trauma, or loved someone who has, maybe it’ll say something that’s been hard to put into words.

Thanks for reading. And to survivors and their children: you’re not alone.

The Inheritance 

He wakes in the dark.

His mouth is dry, and there’s a weight on his chest—not just fear, but something real. Restraints. Ropes, maybe leather. Ankles and wrists bound to a cold metal chair. His head lolls forward, neck stiff. A faint humming sound surrounds him—constant and low, like a machine in the walls.

Then a click. A lamp flickers on overhead. Pale light spills into the room—a concrete basement, empty except for a folding table, a camera bolted into the far corner, and the chair he’s tied to.

He starts to struggle, breath picking up.

“Don’t bother.”

The voice is calm. Male. Tired.

Across from him, seated quietly in a padded office chair, is a man with sallow skin, thin frame, and hollow eyes. Late thirties, maybe. There’s an oxygen tank beside him, plastic tubing trailing into his nose. A handheld remote lies across his lap.

“You’re safe,” the man says. “For now.”

“What is this?” the bound man croaks, throat like sandpaper.

“You’re in my basement. Soundproofed. Secure. No one can hear you, and no one’s coming.”

Fear flickers behind the man’s eyes. “You’ve made a mistake—I don’t know who you are—”

“You will.”

The man presses a button on the remote. A low hum stops—the sound of a space heater, maybe—and silence sharpens the air.

The man breathes, slow and careful.

“You molested my mother when she was a child. You raped her. You stripped away her innocence and stitched shame in its place. You made her believe it was her fault. That no one would believe her. That no one would care.”

He lets the words sit. The other man’s mouth twitches.

“That was decades ago,” he rasps, eyes darting toward the door.

“Exactly,” the man says. “Decades for you to live your life. Get married. Have kids. Grandkids. All while she couldn’t be touched without flinching. Couldn’t be held without shaking.”

He leans forward now, voice softening.

“I’m what’s left of her. The piece that came after. I grew up with a mother who barely existed. Who couldn’t love without bleeding for it. And I spent every year trying to patch holes you left behind.”

“I didn’t—” the bound man starts, but stops. He sees something in the man’s eyes. Something absolute. Hopeless.

“I know what you’re thinking. Denial. Confusion. Maybe even pity,” the man says. “But it won’t help you here.”

He points to the blinking red light on the camera.

“You’re going to spend the rest of your life in this room. That camera feeds to an encrypted server. My attorney and two friends have the password. If I die, they take over. They’ve been instructed not to intervene. Only to observe.”

The bound man starts to shake. “This is illegal. It’s—it’s torture—”

“It’s what she lived with,” the man cuts in. “Every day. In her mind. In her nightmares. I’m giving you a fraction of that.”

He stands, revealing how frail he truly is. His hand trembles as he adjusts the oxygen line.

“I don’t have much longer. Cancer. Final stage. It’s in my bones now. Breathing hurts. Moving hurts. But this… this is what I had to do before I go.”

He begins pacing, dragging the oxygen tank behind him like an anchor.

“I could’ve killed you. Quick. Easy. But that’s not what this is about. It’s not revenge. It’s balance. You left poison in my blood. My childhood was smoke and screaming. My mother would stare at walls for hours. She never talked about you. But I saw it. Every time she flinched when I walked in a room. Every time she apologized for crying.”

The bound man starts sobbing now, a pitiful, wheezing sound.

“I was just a kid,” he says. “I was sick—”

“You were a predator,” the man snaps, stepping forward. “You chose her. You shaped her. And through her, you shaped me.”

He kneels now, slowly, painfully, and looks into the man’s eyes.

“You gave me this inheritance. Now I’m giving it back.”

Silence thickens. Only the faint hiss of the oxygen tank remains.

After a moment, the man rises again and walks to the stairs.

“Please,” the bound man says. “Please don’t leave me here. I’ll die. I’ll go mad—”

“You won’t be alone,” the man says, pausing at the base of the steps. “You’ll have your memories. That’s what she had, too.”

He climbs the steps slowly. At the top, he hesitates.

“You once told her it would be your little secret. Now it really is.”

The door shuts.

Darkness returns.

The bound man screams until his throat gives out. No one comes.

⸻

He dies two days later.

Peacefully. Alone.

In the living room upstairs, slouched on the couch with a blanket over his legs and an oxygen mask still strapped to his face. The TV glows with static. A legal envelope sits on the coffee table beside an empty glass of water and a single photograph of a woman smiling faintly, decades before she forgot how.

When the authorities arrive—days later, flagged by a friend checking on the monitoring server—they find the basement just as described in the man’s instructions. Food trays pushed toward the door. A bucket for waste. A broken man, weeping into the corner, muttering nonsense and prayers and memories no one wants to hear.

But above it all, scrawled across the wall in faded black marker, just above the camera, are five simple words:

“He didn’t get away with it.”

And for the first time in his life, the son rested easy.",1,1745957161.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I am working on fixing the speedometer and overdrive on my 92 W250. I have figured out that the gear ratio reducer on top of the tranfer case that adjusts the speed before the VSS has gone kaput. Essentially, the square prong that inserts into the transfer case opening and turns has rounded off and no longer turns. Additionally, someone at some point used JB weld to solidify parts of it and it wouldn't turn even if it wasn't rounded off. No idea why that was done. 

When I mount the VSS directly to the transfer case, my speedometer works but is obviously off by quite a bit. Luckily it does shift into overdrive now, but at around 45-50 mph which is far too high, likely due to my speedometer being off. Anyways, I get to this... now that PATC is closed, where can I even get a new one? Everyone on the forums in the past suggested them, but near as I can tell they are closed.

I got along really well with the other workers and I learned some of the basics of the job. I was feeling really good about it after I left yesterday. About 20 minutes before my second shift today I got a call from the GM saying that they were letting me go for “being on my phone too much” which had to be completely wrong as I had probably been on my phone for a total of 5 minutes throughout my whole 4 and a half hour shift. I even told him that I can do better in the future. They barely even gave me a chance. Is this legal? I mean I’m sure it is but I really need some advice. Can I ask the manager for a written statement on why I was let go? My mom thinks that they over-hired and he just didn’t want to admit it, but my dad thinks that it’s illegal.

1kaxc8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kaxc8f/can_chicco_viaro_stroller_meet_your_needs_a/,Can Chicco Viaro Stroller Meet Your Needs? A Detailed Review for Parents,"The Chicco 06079746210070 Viaro Quick-Fold Stroller - Graphite is a model I’ve been testing for a few weeks now, and for any parent considering a stroller upgrade, this one might land high on your list. Designed for convenience and style, this sleek number has a lot of strong points that make it appealing to parents dealing with the chaos of daily outings. But no product is perfect, right? So, let’s dive into all the details.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This stroller is undeniably sleek. The 3-wheel design combined with a lightweight aluminum frame not only makes it easy on the eyes but also incredibly practical for navigating tight spaces. Whenever I’ve been in a crowded park or weaving through tight grocery store aisles, the maneuverability of this stroller has been unparalleled. The materials, like the polyester fabric and rubber tires, feel sturdy, and the three-wheel design gives it a modern edge. However, the rubber tires did make me question their longevity on rougher terrains like gravel paths. If you’re sticking to smooth city streets or malls, though, they’ll serve you well.

**Ease of Use**  
From the first time I unfolded it, I noticed the one-hand folding mechanism actually delivers on its promise. The pull strap and button under the seat make for a seamless fold, and it’s compact enough to fit into the trunk of my small sedan—it even stands on its own when folded! That’s a game-changer when you’re wrangling both a toddler and groceries. It’s worth noting, however, that unfolding it does take a bit of practice; the first few attempts were clumsy for me, and I can imagine grandparents might find it less intuitive.

**Comfort for the Little One**  
Kids’ happiness is the real measure of a stroller’s success, isn’t it? The multi-position reclining seat was essential during long days out; my little one could nap comfortably without any awkward angles. The adjustable canopy provided ample shade and did a decent job shielding against light rain. It could’ve been a touch more robust, though, as a particularly windy day left it flapping a bit too much for my liking. And while the 5-point harness system kept my toddler secure, it took a few extra seconds to buckle them in compared to other models I’ve used.

**Storage and Practical Features**  
Storage is always a top priority for me, and the accessible storage basket on this stroller is a definite win. Whether it’s the diaper bag, a shopping haul, or random snacks, there’s plenty of room. The parent tray with two cup holders? Let’s just say it’s my favorite part. I mean, who doesn’t need a spot for their coffee and water simultaneously? The detachable child tray with cup holders is also clever, although I did find the cup holders a tad small for some bulky sippy cups.

**Perks**  
- The folding mechanism is smooth and easy to master.  
- Lightweight frame does wonders for portability.  
- Ample storage space keeps essentials within reach.  
- Multi-position reclining seat ensures naps are hassle-free.  

**Critiques**  
- The front-wheel suspension struggles slightly on unpaved surfaces.  
- Unfolding the stroller could’ve been more intuitive.  
- Canopy isn’t as sturdy on windy days.  

**Maneuverability and Braking System**  
Those swiveling front wheels make taking tight turns feel effortless—an underrated yet crucial feature when running errands. The toe-tap rear braking system? Solid as far as convenience goes. I’ve used strollers where braking felt clunky, but this one locks effortlessly in place. On uneven surfaces like cobblestone, the suspension could be better, but sidewalks and malls? It glides like a dream.

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking this model against other top contenders like the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 or the UPPAbaby Vista, the differences become clear. The Chicco Viaro’s lightweight frame and price give it an edge in affordability, and that one-hand folding mechanism knocks a lot of competitors out of the game in terms of convenience. However, the UPPAbaby Vista offers a smoother ride with its advanced suspension, while the GT2 handles off-road terrains much better. If you’re more about urban use and accessibility, the Viaro is the better fit. That said, frequent joggers or families living in rural areas might want to lean toward the competition.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Here’s the deal: Strollers are an investment, and this one lands solidly in the middle ground. It’s not outrageously priced, but it’s packed with features that justify its cost—like being travel system compatible with Chicco KeyFit and Fit2 car seats. If you’re someone who values lightweight designs, quick-fold functionality, and a reasonable number of premium features, you’ll definitely feel like you’re getting your money's worth.

1kaxajk,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1kaxajk/tilt_table_test_results/,Tilt table test results,"I’ve been dealing with what I thought were “silent migraines” for 7 years. Basically, I always described the feeling as “headache and nausea”, it could last anywhere from hours to days, and the only things that helped when I got these episodes were: not eating (sometimes for >12-24h), drinking coffee, and not sleeping. During these episodes, I also have heat and exercise intolerance, and my HR also rises very quickly from sitting to standing/walking (like ~60 to 120 ish or higher). And I also get extreme fatigue during these episodes. I never associated any of these symptoms with dizziness/fainting or POTS until a year ago when I was talking to my PCP. 

I finally got a tilt table test this week after months of waiting. I fully did not expect anything to happen during this test (in part because letting myself think I might actually get a diagnosis after so many years would be too defeating if it then didn’t happen). After they tilted me from lying down to 70 degrees, my heart started beating like crazy, and I felt extremely lightheaded and things around me looked like they were moving. After ~30s-1min that finally slowed down. But then after another minute or so I suddenly got extremely hot, nauseous, and felt I was going to throw up, and they immediately tilted me back to flat position because they said my blood pressure had dropped so low that I was in pre-syncope (about to faint).

So, obviously these are not normal results for a tilt table test. I have to wait 2 more weeks to actually hear from the doctor in terms of the interpretation, but it seems like I might indeed have POTS. What was illuminating to me was the realization that all these years, what I had been describing as “headache and nausea” is actually the feeling before you faint where blood leaves your head and stomach. I always associated dizziness with seeing stars or fully fainting, so I always described the sensation I felt in my head as a headache instead of dizziness. After near-fainting during the tilt table test this week, I realized that the feeling I have during these episodes is exactly the feeling I got shortly before I near fainted and my blood pressure plummeted (but not quite as intense). I guess because I never fainted fully or saw stars/blackout I assumed they were just headaches accompanied by nausea. 

The doctor during the test said my HR rose “only” by 30, which I guess it right on the cusp for the diagnostic criteria. I also told him prior to the TTT that I never had dizziness because again I thought the feelings I had been experiencing were headaches (I now realize they are dizziness). He said I likely have “mild POTS” but that he needs to review all the data. 

Does anyone else here have “mild POTS”, ie you never actually faint but constantly feel nausea and headaches/dizziness and not eating/drinking coffee are the only things that help?? Also anyone else that had a pre-syncope episode for the first time during TTT when never experiencing symptoms that intense during everyday life?",1,1745956596.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

Started this rabbit hole Nov 2017. There have been a lot of ups and downs - sometimes ups out number the downs - But not in Knottingham .... The kid in me is still kicking. 

  
Anyway - our current struggle and my ongoing frustration are:

* Tithing - My wife and I had a big blow up on this that nearly lead to divorce \[we have 3 kids\]. Our current arrangement is my wife pays on her income. I stay out of it when it comes to the kids. Two nights ago she was bent that my 16 yo doesn't pay tithing and doesn't want to. They had a private conversation and my daughter put it my wife. I see my wife trying to teach tithing by fear, control and ""do-as-I-say"" type tactic.  - If I am being honest I don't see how you can teach tithing any other way since you can't demonstrate or prove any of the promised blessings. 
* My frustration: Church support and resources for Mixed Faith Marriages/Families/Relationships. Personally I find this is a donut - zero resources. I do remember there was an article that the church posted to their LDS Living online page. The author later left the church. The article was pulled from the site. You can still find it via the WayBack Machine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201122044454/https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/who-do-i-choose-god-or-my-husband?lang=eng). 
   * I give a small aside that any ""church source"" all seem to have an agenda. Pray for them. Put their names in the temple. They'll return someday. 
   * Meanwhile there is no support on the day to day. Not only is there no support or resources for how to deal with your spouse does not want to wear garments, pay tithing, go to temple or wants to drink coffee or shop on sunday or any other simple mormon cultural checklist / costly signaling things. But I would argue there are so many mormon aspects are reinforcing the division between husband/wife - family/friend - believer/nonbeliever. Examples of that can be the temple when attending knowing your spouse won't and doesn't believe, or constant talk of temples / covenants. In short all the busy work of mormoning can be a constant reminder of the believe difference. 
   * Where are the messages of bridge building like David Ostler put in his book Bridges.
   * Or common ground like Jon Ogden put in his book When Mormons doubt
   * Or empathy found in the book When Church is Hard by Tyler Johnson

  
If I were to try to answer the tithing issue for my daughter for my wife - she needs to dig deeper and find my daughters spiritual beliefs. Her foundations. I already know my daughter has issues with Joseph and polygamy, patriarchy, misogyny and the imbalance there, and not sure if there is a god. With that being the soup she is swimming - of course she doesn't want to give her money to an organization.

  
I feel like I am in two battles that are a paradox to each other - battling to save / preserve my marriage - versus a battle to protect my daughter and her right to information and autonomy to make her own decision. 

Speaking to my Frustration above. This is where I get really ""angry"" at the church sometimes. I feel like the church absolutely knows people are leaving. I think everyone knows someone that has left the church. Be it a spouse, child, parent, cousin, friend, co-worker, neighbor etc. We all know someone. Which means we are all - - ALL of us are in a mixed faith relationship. I think the church knows that and does nothing to help.

The precinct was buzzing with its usual midday activity: the juniors who hadn't earned their own offices yet were leaving the bullpen for lunch, all chatter and rustle of paper files. More seasoned detectives and officers knew to wait out the chaos and enjoy the consequent peace and quiet. Officer Paddock had just returned from the labs and made a beeline towards Schmidt and Volkov’s cramped compartment, finding them in a tense stillness, with eyes glued to a piece of paper that almost exactly copied the posthumous note in her thick folder. It was the one Schmidt had drawn after seeing the original, that was still being held up by the Evidence Unit.



Whoa, suspenders, huh? she thought.



Both detectives were crouching over Volkov’s messy desk and missed her arrival. Paddock cleared her throat but in vain. She finally marched towards a much more organised Schmidt’s workplace and theatrically dropped the files on it, rattling the monitors and the half-empty cup of coffee that has been cold since yesterday. 



“Here’s everything the lab and archive’s got for you.” she announced. “You don’t expect me to fetch the reports for you, detectives?”



The jolt and her signature ask-without-asking tone pulled both men out of their trance but it took them a second to focus their eyes on her.



Volkov was the first to come to, “Isn’t it your job, Paddock?”



“Excuse me?” the officer went, a note of indignancy in her voice. “If the labs didn’t ask me nicely, I’d never—”



“Jim means,” Schmidt offered with a placating smile. “That we are very grateful. You’re doing us a great service, officer, thank you.”



“That’s more like it,” — she snapped her fingers with a glare at the scowling Volkov. — “I flipped through the papers and I don’t envy you, boys. Lots of weird shit there.”



“The labs texted me earlier, the DNA matches,” Schmidt said. “But I want to see the full report.”



He went over to his seat, making sure to leave enough space between himself and Volkov who got back to hypnotizing the mysterious note. This morning, as Mrs. Marino was letting him into the apartment, her cool greeting told him to refrain from one of his favourite tricks: taking advantage of the crowded space to subtly invade someone’s personal bubble and tower over them for a moment. It seemed to put men on edge almost instantly and with women… it made them far more willing to talk. Schmidt used this weapon sparingly, especially with his partner since it only had a calming effect on him if they were alone. Any kind of witness of this little violation — and Jim went ballistic.



The folder Paddock had brought was weighty and fell apart in his hands into half a dozen smaller ones. He picked up the green envelope with beakers and molecules on it: Labs. 



The officer wasn’t leaving, though, patiently waiting for him to skim through the results. She was interested.



“The DNA matches,” Schmidt mumbled. “But… hang on, it can’t be.”



Volkov perked up, “What?”



“There’s nothing else in the blood, no drugs, no alcohol, nothing.”



“Why are you surprised?” Paddock asked.



“He was sure the widow drugged our Vito and drained his blood,” Volkov said. Even though Mike hadn’t told him about this theory, he knew Schmidt well enough to infer it from the way the morning interrogation went. “She’s not strong enough to make him cooperate without some kinda sedative. Right, Mike?”



“You see right through me, as usual, detective Volkov,” Schmidt said, earning an eye roll from Paddock. She sighed, but their cooing wasn’t infuriating enough to be worth missing the details of the case yet. “But it’s too early to discard her as a suspect.”



“You mean she might have hired someone stronger to overpower Vito and deliver him to her hideout?” Volkov said, doubtful. “What’s the point of stalling then? If she wanted him dead, it woulda been easier to just have him killed.”



“True. But what if killing him wasn’t her intenti—” Schmidt stopped mid-flip through the papers that came from the city archive. Both Paddock and Volkov tuned in. If this human computer noticed a thread, it was sure to unravel into something interesting. They gave him several seconds to focus on the copies of Milena Marino’s civil records with Bellenhaven’s pompous coat of arms on each of the pages. The tip of his finger ran across the multitude of dates and faultlessly stopped at a cluster of dates that seemed to repeat across several rows.



“Very strange,” Schmidt said. “Look, some of her most important documents were all reissued on the same day. The ID, the driver’s license, the passport, all not long after her mother’s death.”



“Does it state the reason for the reissue?” Paddock asked.



“Loss in a fire…” Schmid met his partner’s hesitant eyes across the desks. “She never mentioned a fire…”



“Gimme that,” — Volkov snatched the prints — “Milena Beaumont, id number bla-bla-bla, parents Gabriela and Luca Beaumont, bla-bla-bla… death certificate of the insured… her mother’s will… The insurance claim… Yeah, looks like her mother left her a house in France which burned down soon after her death from cancer. Then the fire destroyed all their family documents and they had to be reissued. Milena musta gotten a small fortune in insurance payout.”



“Hmm…” Schmidt and Volkov hummed in unison, and Paddock’s eyes kept jumping between them as if she was watching a tennis match. These two were exchanging information wirelessly, it seemed.



“She didn’t sound very French to me,” Schmidt said.



“We both know who can tell for sure,” Volkov echoed, folding the note into the back pocket of his jeans.



“To the library!” they barked together and left the room in a synchronous whirl of papers, jackets and farewells.   



\*\*\*



The Volkov’s mind virus must have infected June, too. The detectives found the young woman at her usual workplace but this time, she looked far more dishevelled. Her desk was littered with books and forms that obviously were waiting to be put on the shelves as per her actual work responsibilities. But those took only half of the space: the rest was covered with sheets of white printer paper and splotches of ink, dirty brushes and spilled water.

She looked desperate even from a distance: as Volkov and Schmidt walked in, she didn’t notice their arrival, giving them a good opportunity to see it clearly. Juniper Wilde was crouching on her office chair, one hand frantically twirling her hair. She picked up one of the brushes that somehow materialised since their last visit, sloppily scribbled some characters, and put it back just to get a pen and scribble some more. 



Some unfortunate visitor came up to ask something and was sent away with an irritated glare.



“She reminds me of someone,” Schmidt grinned.



“No idea what you’re talking about, pretty boy,” Volkov said, getting the folded paper out of his jeans and taking off across the lobby towards June.



“Whoa, Jim!” — Schmidt couldn’t help but catch up to his partner and grab his wrist. — “You aren’t going to show her the evidence, are you? She’s not cleared to see the case files. Let me handle it.”



“TSK! These are not case files.” Volkov scoffed, ripping his hand out of Schmidt’s firm grasp. “It’s just a poor rendition of the thing. You know, a barely recognisable— ”



Schmidt knew that if Volkov was going to find out what he’d done, he wouldn’t hear the end of it.



“Jim,” he reasoned. “Let me talk to her first, you are gonna give her a heart attack.”



“What the hell’s gotten into you?”



Their walking quarrel had turned some heads already. But June’s head was still buried into the papers. Schmidt looked the others over with an apologetic smile and missed the moment when Volkov reached the librarian’s desk in a couple of strides.



“Miss Wilde!” he announced. “We’re back. Did you manage—”



June snapped her face up, as if hearing a car honk at her, but the expression of panic quickly turned to a childish delight. She flapped her hands in the air again, and the brush she was holding sent the ink droplets all around. 

This made Volkov stall for a second, and Schmidt took this opportunity to snatch the folded paper from his hand again.



June didn’t notice the splotches on the desk and books and herself, though, “Detectives!”



“Look, Miss Wilde,” Volkov started in a conspiratorial voice as he leaned on her counter, careful not to get ink on himself. “We thought over what you said last time. The Bellenhavel police are ready to offer you an internship if you prove your worth with this case. It’s unpaid, of course, but you will be our invited expert. However, everything we show you must be kept absolutely confidential, do you understa—”



“Really?” her eyes went even wider than before.



“Really?” Schmidt thought, looking at his partner with a similar expression. He knew Volkov wouldn’t have had time to submit the paperwork and have it approved. He was fooling the gullible girl for… what?



“Yes,” Volkov confirmed without a hint of hesitation. “Now,—”



To Schmidt’s horror, June Wilde pulled out the napkin he had given her earlier and slammed it onto the desk in front of them like a royal flush, “I HAVE to tell you what I’ve found on this note!”



It was Volkov’s turn to go wide-eyed. More heads turned in the direction of the noise.



“Detective Schmidt’s copy of the murder note is much better than the character you showed me before,” she went on, unaware of the effect this prop made. “He copied the stroke pattern very well and I did some experiments of my own so I’m sure that the author of the note is a native Chinese speaker.”



Not looking Volkov straight in the face, Schmidt took a second to flash his badge at the room of people to calm them down. But judging by the way Volkov was starting to hyperventilate mere inches away, it wasn’t just the visitors who needed calming.



June still chattered, none the wiser, “But this person also wrote well in English. See, Chinese speakers often struggle to pick up the quickest way to connect lines in Latin letters and just prefer to go top-to bottom, like with hanzi. But this person was educated in both languages and it suggests that he or she learned both in early childhood. De… detectives?”



“Very interesting, Miss Wilde,” Volkov said, looking directly at his partner who was still waving to the rest of the visitors to get back to their work. “Detective Schmidt’s photographic memory is well-known in the police force so he was sure to copy the note very faithfully. It probably took him mere seconds, too, didn’t it, Mike? While his partner was distracted.”



June didn’t realise the gravity of what was happening but detective Volkov’s deliberate tone put her on edge. Like a scared toddler, she shrunk in her seat and put her hands on her lap.



“We appreciate your dedication to helping us,” Schmidt said, finally getting himself together enough to meet Jim’s eyes. “Just please keep your voice down, Miss Wilde. Remember what detective Volkov said, it’s highly confidential.”



Their silent communication was sparking like a powerline. Volkov was nearly wheezing. The reading hall fell so silent one could hear Schmidt’s suspenders shift over his shirt.



Taking it as her own fault, Juniper covered her mouth with her palms.



“Oh no! I’m so sorry!” she whispered in panic. “I’m such a dummy, detectives! Please, forgive me. I was overexcited. I swear I’ll never—”



“As my reputable colleague just said,” Volkov gritted through his teeth. “We appreciate your help. It’s been indispensable. That would be it for today. If you find out anything else you want us to know, please contact—”



“Oh, yes!” June hopped from her chair again and flipped the napkin over, revealing a cell phone number. “Detective Schmidt told me to text him if anything comes up!”



The communication channel between the detectives went offline.

even after you did?

I loved you.
Not in a movie-scene kind of way.
In a real way.
In the way you love someone when you’ve memorized
how they stir their coffee,
how they press their lips together
right before they say something they’re scared of.
The way you find beauty
in a damn raised eyebrow
because it meant they were thinking.
Feeling.
Here.

I could still trace every freckle on your body from memory.
Isn’t that sick?
It's been over two years.
And I still remember how your back felt when you were half-asleep.
I still remember the weight of your silence
when you were trying not to cry.

You were home.
And no one tells you what to do
when your home becomes a locked door
you don’t have the key to anymore.

I’ve tried.
I’ve gone on dates.
I’ve let other people make me laugh.
I’ve let them hold me.
But every time, I feel like I’m cheating-
not on you,
but on the memory of who I was
when you loved me.

And maybe that’s the hardest part.
That I was the best version of myself
when you were around.
And I don’t know who I am without you.

I miss you.
God.
It’s pathetic.
I miss you like you died.
But you didn’t.
You’re just out there
living a life where I don’t exist.
Loving someone else.
Laughing with her the way you used to laugh with me.
Touching her the way you used to touch me.
And somehow, I’m supposed to be okay with that.

Everyone tells me time heals.
They don’t tell you what to do
when time just makes it quieter.
Not better.
Not healed.
Not easier.
Just…
quieter.

I don’t want to die.
But I also don’t want to live like this.
Waking up every morning with your name
still echoing in my chest.

I’m tired.
Not of life.
Just of carrying you around
like some secret grief
no one understands.
Because no one ever saw
how deeply I loved you.
They don’t know
you were my beginning and my undoing
at the same time.

And maybe I shouldn’t have met you.
But if I didn’t,
I’d never know how rare it is

Chapter 1

Kurt sat back in the cool leather chair and brought the coffee cup to his lips, taking a slow, long drink. He smacked his lips and sat it back down in the cupholder. His radio buzzed with chatter about this and that, but he wasn't listening. He was focused. His sharp blue eyes traced every car that passed him. The overhead road lights came on and he backed his cruiser even further  into the shadows. 
He was upset. For the last three years on the job he had given no less than one hundred tickets a year. This year he had only 92, and December was almost over. I'll make it. I still have time. He took another sip before turning off his radio. Illegal, I know, he thought. But who's gonna see? 
He stroked his brown mustache. He thought it was coming along well but he needed to keep putting on that hair grower. His cousin had pointed him in its direction, and he was pleased to say it was working well. He shifted his black uniform and his eyes drifted towards the LED clock on his console. 12:13 PM. his shift would end soon.  
As he looked up a red streak flashed across his vision and he heard the beep of his radar. He glanced at it with increasing interest and he saw it was 127 MPH. giddy with delight he put his car into gear and turned on the sirens. He raced after the car. 93, here I come.  He followed the car, which he saw was a red Subaru, for a solid five minutes before he pulled up beside it and called out his window.
 “Pull over now!” he shouted as he struggled to keep up speed. The car instantly stopped without so much as a second's hesitation and calmly pulled over to the side of the road. Kurt slammed on his brakes and his car made an unpleasant noise as he turned around and pulled behind the subaru.  How the hell did it stop so fast? Kurt thought with confusion as he opened the cruiser door and slammed it behind him. He walked up to the Subaru's windows and knocked on the driver's side glass. No answer.
 “Roll down the window.” another knock, this one forceful. No answer. He shone his flashlight on the window and saw nothing. That's one hell of a tint. He banged on the window with the butt of his flashlight while unholstering his pistol. “If you don't roll down the window, I will break it.” The window rolled down halfway before Kurt saw what was inside. He slowly lowered his light and his hand fell off the butt of the pistol. He began to sweat with terror as the window came to a stop. Inside the car was a body, naked and skinless, the only thing standing out besides the blood red muscle was the mouth. The very muscle and bone of the thing's face had somehow pulled upwards to form some expression, some hellish form of a smile. Its teeth were pure black.   Blood had soaked the entire seat and everything around it. 
“Evening, Kurt. looking for a ninety-third?” the voice inside spoke. Kurt stuttered as his mind reeled. The car door opened and Kurt's hand flew to his pistol again, drawing it up to his shoulder.
 “St-stay in the car! And take off that mask!”
 the voice laughed, a wet, slobbery laugh the Kurt thought sounded like what a drowning boy's last breath would sound like. The door opened further and Kurt stepped back, his hand trembling too hard to aim. In his fear he  noted the busy highway was completely devoid of traffic and the sky was pitch black. He was alone, truly alone. With this. As if sensing his thoughts, the voice continued to talk.
 “I've heard plenty of drowning boys. Drowned some myself. They don't sound like me.” it walked forward and Kurt's thoughts cleared and he heard himself let off two shots that went right through the things chest. It showed no reaction as it continued to walk forward and Kurt, now filled with pure terror, dropped the gun and ran back to his car. He grabbed at the cruiser's door and pulled, and a dull click rang out. Locked. Jesus Christ it’s locked.  He heard the voice behind him. 
“Yes, yes it is. Did you know you wet yourself Kurt?” he felt a hand on his shoulder and he was acutely aware that he felt liquid seeping through his uniform and down his chest. “Like a little boy. A little fucking boy. You're gonna die tonight Kurt. you know that?” Kurt screamed and broke free of his grip. He ran down the highway now, only afraid, barely any sense left. He thought he looked like a rabbit being chased down by a wolf. He screamed again and sobbed, sobbed like a little boy. 
After what seemed like an age of running, he stopped and threw himself against the gray concrete overpass barrier and slid down onto the asphalt. Too tired to run. He began to cry again as he heard meaty thumps he knew to be the things feet. They stopped in front of him. “You can't run Kurt. you never could. Remember high school track? Kicked off the team like a little boy. A little fucking boy, Kurt.” that hand placed itself on Kurts neck and lifted him into the air. Not a tight grip, simply a little pressure. But the damn thing lifted him three feet off the ground anyway. Kurt closed his eyes. 
“Look at me Kurt. look at me.” Kurt shook his head and held his eyelids closed tighter. “Look at me before I rip your eyes out.” Kurt cracked one eyelid and suddenly his eyelids were forced open, some force beyond him ripping them away. He screamed as blood trickled into his eyes. The thing stepped forward until Kurt was over the edge of the barrier. He started to scream but nothing came out. The thing spoke again. 
“Want me to let you go, Kurt?” Kurt nodded in his dim haze of fear. He only realized his mistake a second before he hit the ground 200 feet below. 


Chapter 2 
“Shit.” Carl ran his hand through his sandy blond hair as he stepped away from the body. He had been police chief for eleven years and hadn't seen anything like this before. “This is the fifth damn time.” He saw something shiny in the broken heap of meat and went to pick it up. A hand casually brushed his arm away and Carl looked up to see James, the lead forensics investigator and his good friend. Carl had always been jealous of his casual attitude. James could eat whatever the hell he wanted and not gain any weight. He was three years younger than him, a solid 42, but showed no wrinkles on his chiseled face. His black wavy hair had no grey and his brown skin glowed in the sun. 
 “You know the rules ,chief. Body has to stay untouched.” Carl chuckled nervously, his eyes glued to the body. 
“Sorry. Slipped my mind. So, what's the details?” James cleared his throat and began to speak.
 “Name is Kurt Donald, 32. He had been out waiting in a clearing by the highway stalking speeders, last we knew. His car was found parked on the side of the overpass a few hundred yards away from all this. Looked like he had pulled somebody over and something went wrong. We found a trail of blood leading from the space in front of his cruiser, must have been whoever got out of the car he stopped. It goes up to the cruiser’s driver side door and stops. It seems to pick up again right above us, and goes nowhere. Don't know how it's possible. His car was unlocked but nothing was taken, although his radio was muted. He died from the sudden impact of the ground, and his eyelids are gone.” Carl put his hands in his hair again and sighed a long, shaky sigh. 
“You think it's a serial killer?” James looked down at his feet and his clipboard fell to his side. 
“Yes. I do. Eyelids gone, trail of blood, death by falling, out late at night, everything matches the other four."" Carl felt a dampness in his chest. A year before retirement and I get  hit with this shit.  He walked over to his cruiser door and grabbed his radio.
 “All units, head back to headquarters. We need to have a discussion.” he leaned back out and slammed the door, leaning his arm across it and then his arms.  He heard James get in his cruiser. Must be pretty bad if he doesn't have much to say.  He stood for a second before getting back in and heading back to base.  


Later 

Carl walked up to the brown podium and grabbed the mike. “I'm sure by now most, if not all of you, are aware of the recent deaths of four police officers.” The crowd buzzed and Carl saw many nods. “That number as of today is five. Officer Kurt Donald of the 3rd division was found today. A detailed explanation of the nature of the crimes will be given by forensics leader James Cart. I'm here to give you an order. From now on, all forensic and any free officers will be devoted to the capture of this serial killer, who we have managed to keep from the media. Keep this quiet. Do not go on patrols past dark without a partner and you are advised to not go at all. We are aware that crime does not stop after eight, so well have our senior officers patrol in pairs. Every officer so far has been killed on the job, but we don't want to take any chances. If you go anywhere, on the clock or off it, have a firearm. For now let's all keep doing the best we can for this county. If any of you want to turn up for Kurt's funeral, it's on Sunday at six AM. I'll let James take over from here.”
 Carl stepped away from the mic and quickly left the meeting room, the glass door cold against his hand.  He had a stomach and was sure it wasn't because he had eaten anything. The truth was despite his collected manner during his speech, he was scared. In all his years of working nothing had been quite like this. Blood trails that came from nowhere and lead to nowhere? Five officers killed, all armed, all on the job, all never calling for backup, and all dead within three months? Scary stuff. But what scared him the most wasn't the blood trail but the blood itself. They had run every sample from every trail three times, and all came back N/A. He remembered James walking in a circle in the forensics lab, his arms crossed, speaking to himself after the DNA results came in. He never spoke to himself unless something was really wrong, and that, Carl guessed as he sat down at his chestnut office desk and opened a container of Tum-Tums, was the core of his fear. James was never scared. The last time he had seen James this scared was when his wife was in the hospital with cancer three years ago. “Oh well,” Carl said to nobody in particular as he placed the Tum-Tums back in his drawer and opened his computer. “No use worrying.” he paused as the glow of his computer glowed off his badge and he looked down at his considerable stomach. His wife had been telling him for years to lay off the sweets, and he had. He felt happy again as he noticed his uniform was baggy. He’d managed to lose close to fifty pounds over the last two years, and he was losing faster, but he still wouldn't be trying out for track and field anytime soon. He loaded up his email and was about to go through it when a scrawny intern opened the door.
 “Somebody here to see you, sir. A reporter from Anders, that town up north."" Carl's brow furrowed. Reporter? Hadn't he kept this quiet? He grimaced. Best to get it over with if the press had found out. 
“Send him in.” a hand, half as large as the intern's head, plopped down on his shoulder and the intern jumped. 
“Didn't mean to scare ya, kid.” the intern ducked out of his grip and quickly walked off. The hand’s owner walked through the door and Carl's first impression of him was something like the incredible hulk. The man was easily six feet seven minimum, and he was as large as the door frame. He was wearing a brown detective's coat and had on a brown fedora. His face was tight, as if it was a piece of clothing too small on a body too large. When Carl thought about it later, he was almost sure that was what it was.  The man smiled, and Carl saw he had no facial hair. His eyes were a striking purplish color, and his hair was as brown as his hat. He looked like a child's idea of a detective, like a costume.  The man sat down in the chair in front of Carl's desk, and he thought he saw it dent under the man's weight. He stuck out his hand.
 “Names Anderson. And don't worry, I'm not that kind of reporter. I work for the Anders police department as an intern. We recently had an officer die like your officers. I thought I would collect details, maybe team up with your interns with your permission. Pleased to meet you regardless.” Carl shook his hand and noted his grip was firm but gentle. 
“Same. my name is Carl, although you probably already know that."" Anderson laughed, and for some reason Carl was afraid again. That is not a human laugh, some voice inside him said. Carl pushed the voice away. “So, what questions do you have?” Anderson shifted in his chair and spoke in a firm and gentle voice, much like his handshake. 
“Well for starters, I'd like to know how your staff is feeling about this. Is morale low?” Carl thought that was an odd question but answered honestly. 
“Morale is pretty low, but with your department's help we could catch this guy. And teaming up would give a pretty good boost.” Anderson seemed to smile wider as Carl told him about morale. Carl noticed his eyes. They were not like any eyes he had ever seen. They tracked him, always, never deviating from his own. And they seemed dead. The eyes are the window to the soul. Carl didn't know who had said that, but he did know something else. What was behind those eyes was anything but a soul. 




















  Chapter 3
Around an hour had passed since Anderson left and Carl was very unnerved. He didn't know what to make of anderson. He had been gentle, his voice soothing, his aura one of comfort and safety. But those eyes, that skin, that way he had of speaking like a man who had just learned english while somehow talking smoothly, nothing about him made Carl feel safe. He turned his computer on again and went to the Anders police employee record. Anderson from the Anders police department. More weird shit. He typed in Anderson's first name into the record but stopped. He never told me his last name. He looked back at the screen with fear in his heart. Turns out he didn't need a last name. There wasn't, and had never been, a man named Anderson employed by the Anders police department. Carl jumped out of his seat and ran out of his office to the security room, bursting into the cold cement chamber. The lights were off and he saw the three men that had been chosen to watch the cameras that day were watching Die Hard. Carl absentmindedly thought it was a bit too late for Christmas movies. New years would be appropriate. “Get off the damn movie and run the front parking lot cameras, two hours ago.  One of the men, who had red hair and was pale as chalk, ran the footage back. He set it to 1.5X speed. Carl watched. And watched. “Speed it up.” The pale man set it to 2X. Nothing. He glanced up at the camera’s time display and saw it was 2:14. Fourteen minutes after the man had first entered his office. “Run it back.” nothing. “What the fuck?” Carl said under his breath. He had them run it at three, the time Anderson had left and Carl had watched him drive off in his red subaru. Nothing again. “What the fuck?” Carl asked again, this time louder. The pale security man spoke. “Looking for something in particular, sir?” Carl nodded aggressively. “A red Subaru and a big ass dude. Impossible to miss. Are you sure these are from today?”  Pale boy zoomed in on the upper corner of the footage, where the time, date, and other things always sat. Carl saw with dismay it was the right day. He thought he could feel his face going colorless.  If nobody came in, and nobody came out, who the hell was in my office?  In the irrational circumstances he was in, his brain was apt to find a rational explanation. So he thought for a moment. “ Has anybody come in here in the past few hours? Anyone suspicious asking to have access to the tapes?” Pale boy shook his head. “No sir. We don't let anyone in unless they get your permission. Need us to do anything else?” Carl’s head was racing.  It's happening too fast, he thought absurdly. In the movies there's always a calm before the storm. Where's the calm?  “No, I'm good. Thanks for your time.” Carl left before security could answer him, letting the steel door slam shut behind him. I just need rest, that's all. Some time to think everything over.  He went back to his office and grabbed his things before wishing the secretaries goodbye and starting his walk home. He lived only a five minute drive away but with an uphill walk like this, it would take him a half hour to walk home. He started doing it to lose weight and he thought he could feel the calories burning away. But today he didn't feel that. As he walked home in the cool winter breeze, a cloudy sky with no snow, he thought about Anderson.  I just had a conversation with a serial killer. I'm sure of that now. And the cameras… somebody on the inside has to be working with him. Why didn't I report that? My god. That man… a fucking mountian of a man and nobody saw him but me and that intern? Something's very wrong with this picture.  “Hello, carl.” Carl flinched and almost lost his footing on the sidewalk when the voice scared him out of his thoughts, but a hand stuck out and grabbed him before he fell. In the second it took him to look up, he was afraid he would see the face of Anderson, grinning with that stretched mouth and empty eyes. But it was just one of the Yang brothers. A local cult that had been around for years. They haven't caused any trouble after the bunker raid a few years back. Now they just walked around in their white robes, screaming about the end times.  This one in particular Carl had seen several times. “Having trouble in the office, eh? You almost fell. Your face tells a story, you know. Trouble is ahead. Yang knows this and we can fight it. Nevermind the raid, carl. Join us! The brothers are eager to have a new recruit.” Carl threw the hand out to the brother’s side.
 “Leave me alone. Though I told you last time to never speak to me again."" Carl said this with the intent of making the man angry, perhaps so he would slip up and give Carl the chance to arrest him. But the brother’s face looked thoughtful, and he followed Carl as he walked up the hill once more. “Come on, Carl. you know we're right. I see it in your face. You look like you just had a visit with the devil.” Carl whirled around.  A visit with the devil.  That was exactly what he had had, one way or another. He grabbed the Yang brother by his hood and held him. 
“Shut the fuck up. Just shut up. I've dealt with enough shit today for the rest of my life and you're making it worse. Why don't you go find Yin and shove him up your ass?” he shoved the brother away, and when he turned around, his face was no longer thoughtful. It was malevolent and foreboding.  “You have no idea what's coming, just like how you have no idea what is already here. You wonder where the calm was. But was it ever there? Or were you choosing to ignore the storm floating all around you? Hell is cold, you know. We speak to the devil. You think you know the truth of your existence. But you don't, and you never will. Or, perhaps, you will. It is not my say. That saying belongs to Him. and you would be advised to stay on His side. Meeting the devil is only the introduction to hell, you know. At its core, hell is dark. A dark void with nothing and nobody. When you end there you will feel nothing. You will be nothing. Because the dark wills it so. Watch your lights. Or, rather, watch the places your light does not touch. You may find something there you will never find again.” The brother pulled his hood back over his head and his face sunk into darkness. He walked away. Carl stood for a long time. He didn't move. He simply thought. And in his thoughts, he came away with one stupid thought. One human thought, something a little boy would find in that long speech from the brother. I should sleep with my lights on tonight.  He walked the rest of the way home in silence, with no thoughts in his head other than Yang and Him. Who was Him? God? Or the other one? Carl believed Yang spoke of the latter. But he laughed off the implication that this was anything but a simple criminal who needs to be caught, because, after all, he was a cop. He caught bad guys. So he should catch a bad guy. Tomorrow, he thought, trying to put his troubles behind him, tomorrow I'll worry.  

Later

Carl hit the raw chicken with the meat hammer. Up and down, up and down, tenderizing it. He set the hammer down and picked up the cutting board with the chicken on it, carrying the brown piece of wood over to the crock pot and slid the chicken into the black pot and hit the on button. The smell of soup filled the room and he went and sat at the dinner table. Alone. There were two other chairs at the table, and only one of them had been used the past three years. His wife had left him for another man three years ago, and officially divorced him two years ago. His son Sam had died four years ago, and that was the source of the trouble. He had drowned on his way home from school, probably walking along the sidewalk, not a care in his eleven year old head, when something happened. A simple trip, or maybe, just maybe, a push had ended up with him falling off the sidewalk and slamming his head on the concrete before sliding into a ditch filled with water. He had been found facedown, his Minecraft backpack filled with water. His wife blamed him. He was supposed to take him home that day, but he told him in the morning it wasn't too slick to walk home, and wasn't too wet. He assured him he would be fine. Carl was aware he was crying at the table, alone. And that thought only made him cry more. He supposed he was lucky. He never turned to cigarettes or alcohol. Rather he drowned himself, much like his son, in his work. He helped run thirteen different major busts that year. Seven  more than average. His wife said he was a machine, more devoted to his work than her. He supposed she was right in the end. His sorrow was not for her, who he had always harbored neutral  feelings for, but for Sam. He had loved Sam with all his heart. He had never loved anyone as much as him and most likely never would again.Lost in sorrow he cried, for  how long he did not know. He was finally broken from his prison of memory by the long beep that signaled the crockpot was ready. He opened his eyes, red and blurry from tears, and went over to it. He grabbed the lid and carefully lifted it off. He set it on the marble counter, and shredded the chicken before placing the lid back on and starting it again. Then he realized. He lived in a small neighborhood on the outskirts of the main city, but he always heard the drone of the highway and passing cars, always heard the birds chirping, always heard people walking their dog. But he heard nothing. He went to his window and opened it. It was dark. He wasn’t hungry anymore. It was just four. I swear to god it was just four… he looked at his microwave clock. It was three in the morning. What the hell was happening? Suddenly he heard the long and somewhat dramatic creak of  a door opening in the hallway. The lightbulb above his head glowed fiercely until it was brighter than the sun, and Carl shielded his eyes from its all encompassing glow. Then it shattered, and every light in the house shattered with it. He heard the crockpot explode too and his back was covered with a fiercely hot liquid and Carl screamed and pawed at his back before running into the hall shower and turning on the water, not caring that he was still clothed. But it didn't stop. He continued to burn. The shower door slammed shut and the water began to fill the tub. Carl continued to scream until he was hoarse. He turned off the water but it didn't work, the shower head kept pouring and pouring, until his ankles were covered. Then his knees, then his legs, then his chest… as the water approached his head he heard laughter. The water stopped. The burning stopped. He heard meaty trumps coming from the hallway and he suddenly overcome with fear so thick he felt as if the parts of him not underwater had become submerged too. A primal fear. The thumps continued until they stopped right outside the cherry wooden door and he heard a fierce snap as whatever was outside his door punched a hole through it. It reached in, only a silhouette in the darkness which continued to accompany Carl, and ripped the doorknob off. The door slowly swung open. The room became filled with pure malevolence, pure hatred, pure cynicism. Then a laugh. It was a horrible laugh, like the thing's throat was submerged. Like it was drowning. Carl became sure of something then. It was Him. The thing the Yang brother referred to. And then it was there. It stood against the darkness, somehow glowing without producing any light. Carl saw Him with shocking clarity. He was tall, taller than carl. He looked down at him. He was naked, skinless, his muscles flexing as if they were separate entities. He was relatively fit, and he reminded him of the anatomy dolls they had in high school. But his face was what differed. Instead of eyes there were two huge pits, each blacker than black but each with a piercing purple light where the pupil should be, like a laser pointer. At first Carl thought He had no teeth, but he did. They were black. He dripped blood, no, poured it, as if he truly had just been skinned. The purple lights locked on carl. “Having a good time, Carl? I know I am. And don't try to talk, you won't be able to.” Carl tried anyway but nothing came. “I won't stay long. Don't worry. I just have a message for you.” the thing comically cleared its throat. When it spoke, it spoke with sharp hatred. “You are nothing, Carl. Nothing. You are a small, fat, little nothing. You try so hard to be something but you can't. I will make you suffer. I will make others suffer. But that is not my purpose here. You spoke earlier of the calm. So did Yang. but you both got it wrong. The calm has been your whole life. So ask yourself, Carl, if your forty years of existence have been calm, what is the storm?”  He smiled wider. “You'll find out soon, my friend. Oh, and Sam says hi. He told me to make you understand him a little better.” The water turned on again and didn't stop. It went over his head. As Carl screamed for air and banged the glass and spasmed and choked, he saw Him through the glass. He never stopped smiling. 








Interlude: Limbo 
Carl was in a field. It was a great field, green and sunny in that way only matched by the vibrance of neon, the sky clear and sunny. It felt as if he was standing in some great memory, some lost child's memory of summer. The field stretched endlessly in every direction, and he heard the chirp of birds despite the fact no birds were there. He turned in every direction, the light stinging his eyes, and he shielded them with his hands for a second before putting them down. 
“Hello?” he called out. “Is anyone here?” as he was about to call again he felt a charge run through his body, not one of electricity but of light, and he suddenly felt safe. Like nothing could touch him. He heard the angelic sound of trumpets and saw the sky split open and an angel descend from the glowing rift exactly like something out of a cartoon. The angel was beautiful, a woman with fine blond hair white wings and a white robe. Her face looked too perfect to truly exist, as if she was not real but a stone statue shaped by the hands of michelangelo. Her skin was glowing with holy light and her wonderful hair flowed down to her shoulders, her eyes were a perfect sea green and they focused on Carl with a warm light.  She touched down and smiled at Carl. he suddenly felt as if he was an intruder, like his imperfect human form was not worthy of meeting this radiating figure. He became embarrassed, but when she spoke, he instantly felt as if she was speaking to an old friend. 
“Hello, carl. My name is Yin. I appear to you in this form because it is one humans commonly associate with safety.” she brushed a strand of blond hair from her angelic face before continuing. “You must have oh so many questions. Come, sit, let us talk.” a round marble table materialized in front of him and he was aware a bench had appeared behind him and Yin. he sat on the marble bench, bracing for the cold. It was warm and comfortable, as if it was feathers instead of stone. Carl felt in awe of Yin, felt amazed and confused and not a little excited. He remembered he had read The Hobbit as a teen and chuckled inwardly as he thought that he and Bilbo might not be in different circumstances. He cleared his throat.
 “I do, your holiness. Could I ask why I was chosen to be here?” Yin laughed and Carl thought it to be the polar opposite of His laugh, His laugh was cruel and wet and full of hatred. Simply thinking of it was enough to make Carl want to scream. Yin’s laugh was one of kindness, of safety and care, unmatched in happiness. She spread her hands outward as she spoke.
  “You are in Limbo, Carl. limbo is a place in between my kingdom…” she stopped for a second and her smile faltered. “And His kingdom. Right now this is a place of good. I chose this because I believe it is the perfect place to have a conversation with a friend. But back to your question. You may be expecting some grand answer, but truthfully, you were not chosen by me or Him. you were chosen by something else.” Carl thought about this with his hands on the table. He didn't much care now how he was chosen, but what was to come. 
“What is going on?” he asked.  Yin placed her hands calmly together on the table in front of her, and her mesmerizing green eyes stared into Carl with apprehension. 
“A storm is coming, much like that man told you. The hooded one. I can't tell you what will happen or why, you must find that out yourself if you are to succeed. But what I can tell you is that a war has begun. And you will be my only soldier.""She looked on the verge of tears and Carl felt immensely afraid. A god was crying in front of him, and that did not mean well. “I feel immensely guilty for having to put you in such a position, but you must understand it was not my choice. It was my father’s. Eventually you will learn of my father and the other one. Him. but you will learn in time. I will be with you on your journey.” Carl sat, dismayed. Why him? Does he not have enough on his hands with the killer running loose and his sadness? Now he must be thrust into some war of the gods? It all felt unfair. But he did not say that. Instead, he said something else.
 “I'll do it. But when it’s over, what do I get?” Yin shook her head and smiled sadly.
 “Nothing, or maybe something. It isn't for me to know. But you must trust, Carl. trust i will guide you.” Carl stood up and held out his hand. Yin stood up and held her hand out. When Carl went to shake she retracted it with a playful smile. “I have faith that you will accomplish your goals as well as mine, Carl. I believe this partnership is a lasting one. And I will show you some of my power as proof of my status.” she held out her other hand and a bolt of electricity host from it and into Carl’s stomach. He felt something change. At the same time Yin offered her hand again and Carl took it. Yin's eyes went white and she began to ascend and  speak in a voice not her own.
 “Clear!”

I am trying to keep my Starbucks habit going while on a budget. I understand upfront costs of syrups and sauces and that's fine.

I recently purchased a Nespresso vertuo latissima machine.

I posted a photo of the copycat caramel macchiato that I made. It has two pumps of Starbucks vanilla syrup, a Starbucks caramel coffee Nespresso pod, and oatly milk. The Machine Brews the correct amount of coffee with the correct amount of milk while frothing the milk.

I currently have:
- vanilla syrup
- sugar-free vanilla syrup
- caramel syrup
- hazelnut syrup

I want:
- Caramel sauce
- white mocha sauce
- mocha sauce
- frappe base

I know the sauces are Fontana.

1. Can I purchase my once at starbucks? I purchased all of my sauces directly at Starbucks.

2. Can someone provide the brand and/or nutritional facts label of the frappe base?

3. Can someone please provide the Salter Caramel Cold Foam recipe?

Ill also take any advice and or recipes you want to provide.

Thank You again for everything you do and i appreciate everything you all do. TIA!",1,1745956121.0,starbucks,1,0.67,False

The bells over the café door jangled twice when he stepped inside with a quick stutter, like an echo tripping over itself.  

The smell hit him first: scorched coffee, wet paint, and something sour underneath. He didn’t remember it ever smelling like that.



His eyes caught it immediately on the fourth item down:  

*Wynn’s Special — $5.25*

He stared.  

*I don’t have a special.*



Behind the counter, a woman in her fifties with a red bandana and an easy smile caught his eye and lit up.  

""Auggie Wynn,"" she said, wiping her hands on her apron like she’d been waiting years. ""Look at you. We were wonderin’ when you’d wander home.""



It scraped something raw inside him. He smiled automatically, the kind you give at funerals, and ordered a black coffee, foregoing small talk.



The woman poured it fresh, humming a tune he couldn’t place. When she turned to ring him up, August glanced back at the blackboard.



The “Wynn’s Special” was gone.



He blinked hard.  

*Just tired from the long drive. Just rattled.*



He paid cash and stepped back out into the sunlight, coffee burning the chill off his palms.



Everywhere he moved, heads turned half a beat late. Smiles arrived too soon or too wide. The street felt too narrow now. The sun too heavy. His name stuck to the air like a scent he couldn’t scrub off. Halfway down the block, he caught himself glancing at the shopfront windows. Watching himself walk. Making sure he was still there.



At the barber’s, he stopped.

This year, the new ones were less straight-gourmands and more gourmand-atmospherics, which was a really fun approach for me because I don't tend to love scents that are too literally ""dessert."" I was thrilled to see several tea scents among the new releases - but to my surprise, they weren't my favorites!

**Ordering specs:** [Nui Cobalt's website](https://nuicobaltdesigns.com/) is easy to navigate, shipping is very affordable at $3.45, items come very securely packed, and customer service is always spectacular. I don't think I've ever placed an order that took more than 2-3 business days to ship (and recently it has usually been literally the very next day). Samples are generous - 1.15 mls at least - in vials with wand caps. Each order comes with one free sample, chosen by them (there’s no box to insert requests).

**Nui Cobalt's typical annual schedule of releases:** (I \[and especially Nui Cobalt\] make no promises, of course, that these collections will recur; this is just *in my experience*)

* Late January - Valentines (Philias, Crushes, Les Désirs Dangereux, and Babalon Exalted)
* Late February - Bees, Favorite Things (formerly also Celtic Treasures)
* Late March - April Fools
* Late April - Critters
* Late May - Fae Folk
* Late June - Big Island, Dances, Vision
* Late July - Witches' Utility Blends
* Late August - Autumn 1
* Late September - Autumn 2
* Late October - Astronomy, Whole Being, Astrology (formerly also Ascended Masters, Good & Evil)
* Late November - Yule/Nutcracker
* Late December - Geeks & Gamers

**A note about my preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (especially honeysuckle, plumeria, tiare, and tuberose; though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

\*\*\*Keep in mind that I don't tend to love gourmands, so if you're a gourmand fiend, the ones that don't quite work for me - especially if I find them too sweet! - are likely to be huge hits for you!

# 2025 New Releases

**Mumpsimus: Dessert on the Isle of Tortuga** \[A tropical melange of passionfruit, guava, papaya, persimmon, and mango with a splash of Caribbean rum\] - Boozy gummy candy! In addition to the very tropical fruits (mango and passionfruit for sure; I'm not sure I'd recognize the other fruits since I'm less familiar with them), at first I got a red cherry, then in the drydown, I could swear there was candied blackberry. Meanwhile Husband, sniffing my wrist, named this as strawberry lemonade before I told him what the official notes were. This is SUPER fruity, candy-sweet, and incredibly leisurely, the scent of a summer vacation. I personally like the more velvety late drydown of this more than the opening, which feels a little artificially sweet, so it's worth giving this a good long first-test.

**Pettifogger: Dessert in Trafalgar Square** \[An iced bun and a London Fog latte made with Earl Grey, and steamed vanilla oatmilk\] - Teatime! Yep, it's a sweet bun, enriched dough like a cinnamon roll but without any cinnamon, topped with a very sugary and crisp royal icing, along with a milky London Fog (all of that makes perfect sense from the notes description) and...a LOT of anise! Where did that come from? I don't even sniff anise in the vial, but it's unmistakeable and strong on my skin. This calls to mind Poesie's **Sotnos** \[Freshly baked buttery rolls filled with cardamom-spiked sugar and drizzled with a sweet glaze of vanilla and condensed milk, a small cup of sweet black tea\], that same ""fika"" tea break vibe with a cup of tea and a delicious pastry, but instead of cardamom buns it's more like pizzelle cookies, crisp and strongly licorice.

**Quack: Dessert Overlooking the Duck Pond** \[Bright yellow kumquat, chilled prosecco, amber resin, mockorange blossom, daisy, and water musk\] - This is so citrusy and fresh and clean! I'm getting lemon fizzy water, bright and refreshing (and a little bit watery, not sweet like soda). Meanwhile Husband, sniffing my wrists, asked, ""sweet tea and nice soap?"" and I can totally see where he's getting that - there's a tea-like quality to the really gentle amber, and a beautifully clean and spa-like effect overall. I'm liking this in spring but I think it's going to be especially wonderful on sticky-hot summer days. Longevity is very low, lasting just over an hour before it gets so faint it's almost no longer there.

**Nargle: Dessert in the Desert** \[Spikenard, almond blossom, oatcakes, maplewood, tan suede, and tea\] - Maple syrup-drenched baked oatcakes, but this isn't a straight gourmand nor is it unbearably sweet - it's about as sweet as **Little Brown Rabbit**, if that helps. Behind those gourmand notes are a really lovely, grounding suede and a snuggly black tea, plus the faintest wafts of floral - the almond blossom floral reminds me a lot of BPAL's **Wild Sweet Pea** \[Vanilla-soaked sweet pea, white sandalwood, and almond milk\]. If you like NCD's recent **The Thriae** \[Creamed honey, Shea butter, oats, sacred benzoin, and clean skin musk\] from the Bees, this one would be well worth trying, because it shares the oats and snuggliness, but with a little more oomph from the other notes.

**Misprision: Dessert on a Picnic Blanket** \[Dandelion leaves, malted barley, sun-dried linen, vernal musk, and a basket of wild mulberries\] - The bitter green (must be the dandelion leaves, maybe also the vernal musk) reminds me of petitgrain or the green herbal opening of neroli. That's the majority of what I'm getting here, joined by a faint red berry (redcurrants?) plus, oddly enough, oatcakes. It feels like a woodland fairy's tea party.

**Faitour: Dessert in New Orleans** \[Pecan tart, roasted chicory, a splash of whiskey, bronze musk, black agar, dragon’s blood, and vetiver smoke\] - A smoky, slightly peated whiskey, earthy oud, burnt coffee, and roasted chestnuts. This is a very ""brown"" scent, and I can tell it's objectively well-done (the balance between the notes is really spot-on), but it's not for me - I don't personally enjoy most of those four notes that my nose is identifying (though the whiskey note is admittedly very cool). I offered it to Husband, who *does* like whiskey and oud (and who would probably have adored this if it also contained leather) but he doesn't love its more foody notes of nuts and coffee.

**Counterfeit: ""Dessert” in a Chicago Speakeasy** \[A gin fizz with simple syrup and a twist of lemon enjoyed among jazz legends and rowdy revelers\] - Yep, gin, simple syrup, and lemon. There's a fresh juniper-pine-mint to the gin botanicals that makes it feel incredibly fresh and refreshing. There aren't any fabric notes listed, but it has a sort of tweedy vibe that reminds me a bit of **Voyeur** \[Wet Bulgarian lavender, lemon verbena, old books, oakwood, and tweed\], which also has lemon. Husband, who loves making gin cocktails, immediately snaffled this one. He had an odd experience when trying it - on his fingers, he gets juniper quite strongly, but on his wrist, it's mostly lemon! It's not his usual - he typically goes for leather, patch, and tobacco notes - but he's very pleased with this one and I bet he'll wear it a lot this summer.

# Past April Fools

**Balderdash: Cherries Jubilee** \[Jewel-bright Montmorency cherries poached in brandy and drizzled while warm over vanilla ice cream\] - A STRONG cherry-almond with thick buttery vanilla ice cream and perhaps even a hint of waffle cone. I don't smell the brandy in the vial but *whoo boy* does it come out on my skin, boozy and decadent. This scent has a lot of throw, more than most Nui Cobalt's on me.

**Flim Flam: Mango & Sticky Rice** \[Lush Philippine mango with steamed sticky rice and a decadent drizzle of coconut syrup\] - Mango, sticky rice, and coconut, that's exactly what this is! I had this dessert last summer when visiting my mother, and putting this perfume on has immediately taken me back to that trip. The only difference between this and the actual dessert we shared is the black sesame seeds that were a garnish. This is super summery and tropical, a very joyful scent.

**Mendacity: Horchata** \[Classic horchata made from jasmine rice, demerara sugar, and true Ceylon cinnamon\] - Cozy, lactonic rice milk, a sugar that reminds me of Nocturne Alchemy's ""blue sugar"" (if you've tried it, you know what I mean; it's hard to describe but there's another element to it besides just ""sweet""), fragrant cinnamon as in snickerdoodle cookies, and I'm also getting the tiniest hint of lemon. This is soft and snuggly, perfect for a rainy day or a lazy autumn morning. The cinnamon isn't giving my skin a rash (I sometimes have that reaction to cinnamon notes) though it is tickling a bit, and since neither rice milk nor cinnamon are quite my thing, and since those are the two strongest notes here, I'll end up destashing this sample.

\~\~\~

# Personally...

I expected to love **Pettifoggers** the most, but in fact it's the lighter, more citrusy ones - **Quack** for me, and **Counterfeit** on Husband - that are my favorites from this bunch! Rice notes are, to my dismay, probably not really my thing, but no doubt I'm going to continue trying them because they do often sound just *so cozy.* And since I tried three older April Fools scents alongside the sample set of this year's new ones, it's really apparent that their approach changed this year - no longer photorealistic (""nasorealistic""?) desserts but more the *experience* of eating desserts in various interesting locations.

If you've tried any of the new ones, I'd love to know what you think! Has your experience been the same as mine?",7,1745956053.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I also thought they were cute but they must have been visiting my town because turns out they live three hours away.

Well okay Im not really for long-ish distance dating. I know it's not that far but I really prefer spending time with people in person. But I don't want to rule people out so okay let's plan a date. We're meeting halfway and I ask him to choose the location. And it's been like pulling teeth. I've been starting to get like a feeling that I'm really not into this no matter how cute he is and if it's going to be like this I'm not interested.... Then chooses Starbucks???

Now listen I'm not opposed to a coffee date or a cheap date. I'm not even opposed to going Dutch on a date. But after all of the hassle choosing something as low effort as Starbucks rather than putting some effort into finding a local cafe is giving me the ick.

Maybe I should be going back with an alternative suggestion but honestly after all this I'm feeling over it. Would I be an asshole if I just cancelled the date entirely over all this? I work all week I don't feel like spending the time to have to do all this back and forth so early on when I'd already mentioned that I don't like coffee and that I like supporting local businesses.

No dating, no flirting, no deep conversations. Nothing that felt... genuine or personal.

All my experiences have been online web chats, forums, random voice apps. And to be fair, I do enjoy those. I’ve had some decent and even surprisingly deep convos late at night with females from halfway across the world. It scratches a certain itch, being able to connect, laugh, and be a little flirty without the pressure. But it’s also starting to feel like a crutch.

Lately I’ve caught myself feeling more down than usual. Like I’m missing out on something basic that most people figured out in their twenties. It’s not even about dating or sex. It’s more the emotional stuff - knowing how to hold a conversation in person, reading body language, building comfort in real life. That whole area of my life feels completely undeveloped, and honestly, it's starting to scare me.

Part of me wants to change things, start small, try to open up a bit in person - even if it's just chatting with someone at a bookstore or coffee shop.

I got behind on descaling, and pressure through the group head dropped. The steam wand still had good pressure, so I suspected a clogged solenoid valve.

I took apart the boiler, and sure it enough it was full of scale. I descaled the interior and the solenoid valve, and then put the whole kit back together. Now I had a new problem: zero flow through the group head. Steam wand still going great though.

I assumed that some of the scale I had shaken loose had clogged the solenoid again, so I took it apart again. I cleaned it out with air pressure, and then verified that water flowed through both of the holes in the valve. Reassembled: still no flow through the group head.

So... what should I do now?

Option A: maybe the black solenoid controller is damaged. I could replace it. It's about 60 USD in parts, but if it extends the life of the machine for a few years that seems fine.

Option B: maybe I screwed up the wiring? Is there a wiring error that would make the entire machine work correctly except the solenoid? I've double-checked, and I think I put it back together the same way. The only thing that seems odd is that the solenoid in my machine was never grounded, the third connector on the black solenoid controller is not used.

Option C: maybe I installed the solenoid valve wrong, or cleaned it badly? I don't think so. The spring assembly moves smoothly, and I've verified that water flows cleanly through both paths through the solenoid valve.

Option D: give up. 14 years is a good lifetime for a Gaggia Classic. I kind of don't want to let it go, though. I added a PID controller, the machine is pretty easy to maintain, and it makes good coffee!

1kawwso,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kawwso/could_the_tastyle_k302_singleserve_brewer_review/,Could the Tastyle K302 Single-Serve Brewer Review Reveal its Portable Perks?,"Testing out the Tastyle K302 Single Serve Coffee Maker has genuinely been an interesting experience, and I mean that in the best way possible. My daily ritual involves coffee as if my entire personality hinges on that caffeine boost, so diving into this sleek machine was something I took rather seriously. Compact, lightweight, and stylish with its black and gold design, I could immediately see why people love having it in their office, RV, or even while traveling. Its “coffee anywhere” vibe is complemented by a neatly designed portable handle—a feature that my coworker was oddly obsessed with when I brought it to a team camping trip.  

**Design and Portability**  
The simplicity of the design makes it a real winner in the ""just grab-and-go"" competition. It's small enough to easily stash away in a corner of my desk or pack into a travel bag without taking up valuable space. Plus, the built-in handle totally lives up to the hype. It saved me from fumbling around, especially when the cabin trip required three extra bags, a scarf I didn’t really need, and a coffee lover’s dedication to caffeine. Bonus points for the sharp black and gold finish, which made it look far more luxurious than something you’d toss in your RV.

**Ease of Use**  
One-button operation? Where has that been all my life? Just add water to the visible 12-oz tank—marked so well even pre-coffee me could decipher it—pop in a pod or grounds via its reusable filter, and with a tap, it brews in three minutes flat. On mornings when breakfast is more of an idea than a reality, this feature was life-saving. It’s like the machine knew how impatient I was. Also, everything is pretty intuitive, so I didn’t have to trudge through some 50-page manual.

[Ready to buy Tastyle K302? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dhclp5jk/)

**Quality of Brew**  
I was skeptical about how such a compact machine could deliver on taste. Let’s be honest, single-serve brewers often falter with coffee grounds—but nope, this machine worked like a charm. The reusable filter, complete with a lid that prevents that annoying ground coffee sprinkle in your cup, brewed smooth coffee that tasted consistently premium. Switch from pods to up to 20g of your preferred grounds, and it handles both equally well. One of my friends is a dedicated K-Cup junkie, while I lean towards freshly ground beans—the machine became our middle ground, though not without some minor quibbles. 

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Here's where I let out an audible sigh of appreciation: it has a self-cleaning function. The descaling reminder deserves a trophy, too. I always forget that coffee makers need, you know, maintenance. This machine politely reminded me, and cleaning turned out to be easy—even parts like the filter and pod holder slide right into the dishwasher and out as good as new. However, the machine doesn’t have a drip tray, which led me to slip a cloth underneath post-clean-up. Losing points there, for sure, but nothing tragic. 

**Strong Points**  
- Compact and highly portable with a handle.  
- Dual brewing options, compatible with pods or grounds.  
- Super fast and easy to use with one-button brewing.  
- Reusable, dishwasher-safe filter for seamless cleaning.  
- Energy-efficient with automatic shut-off for safety.

**Critiques**  
- No drip tray means you’ll want a cloth or napkin nearby.  
- Limited to 800 watts, which sometimes feels slower for busy coffee fiends.  
- The 26-inch electric cord can cramp your style if your outlets are inconveniently placed.  
- It could use a temperature control feature to make it even more versatile.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing the machine to heavyweights like the Keurig K-Mini or the Black+Decker Single Serve Maker was enlightening. While the Keurig has surged ahead in the variety of pod flavors it supports and its somewhat flashier brand reputation, it doesn’t come with the descaling reminder or reusable filter that I found incredibly helpful with the Tastyle K302. On the flip side, the K302 doesn’t have the Keurig’s multi-user features, but it’s much better suited for single-person use or travel. Black+Decker edges out due to its slightly quicker brew time, though in terms of taste and cleaner cups of coffee, the K302 holds its own just as well.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
For a single-serve brewer, the K302 isn’t over-the-top in pricing but still manages to pack in a robust feature set typically found in pricier competitors. Its value proposition is especially evident if you travel often or live in tighter spaces like a dorm or apartment. If you’re brewing for one or two, and the idea of minimal hassle appeals, the cost-efficiency of this little wonder feels like a no-brainer to me. Sure, some compromises exist, but for what you’re shelling out, it’s indeed worth every penny.

1kaww9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1kaww9h/mini_pill_versus_progesterone/,Mini pill versus Progesterone,"My HRT journey has been difficult so far and I’m coming here for any advice or experience you can provide!

I was previously taking only 100 mg of progesterone (pill) and I felt great. My doctor at the time advised I take estrogen (patch), which made me feel awful. It made me anxious, bloated me, and I couldn’t sleep. We slowly decreased the dose, but I didn’t feel better until I was completely off of the estrogen. We also tried estradiol pull lowest dose and it didn’t sit well. 

So then she took me off of both progesterone and estradiol and put me on the mini pill. Three weeks in I’m depressed, anxious, getting acne, have labido issues, and just generally feel yucky. I broke up with my boyfriend. I’m not suicidal but I feel really down. However I’m also extremely anxious. Like, I can’t drink coffee because I feel so anxious. Also I have the foggiest brain. 

I looked at the dose of the mini pill and it looks like the norethindrone are only .35 mg versus the progesterone I was taking at 100 mg. The whole reason I was taking progesterone was due to my sleep and anxiety, and it helped me so much. I don’t know much about the conversion rate of these two medications to know if perhaps .35 mg in norethindrone is equivalent to the 100 mg in progesterone, but it doesn’t feel like it. I feel a bit like I’ve been thrown down the river without a paddle with this medication, especially after going from 100 mg. 

My question is why is my doctor not wanting me to just be on the 100 mg progesterone? I’m not sexually active so it’s not that I’m needing the birth control aspect of the pill. I just want the 100mg progesterone pill back and not have to take estrogen. Is this an unreasonable request medically? Is anyone else on this regimen?

even after you did?

I loved you.
Not in a movie-scene kind of way.
In a real way.
In the way you love someone 
when you’ve memorized how they stir their coffee, 
how they press their lips together 
right before they say something they’re scared of.
The way you find beauty in a damn raised eyebrow
because it meant they were thinking.
Feeling.
Here.

I could still trace every freckle on your body from memory.
Isn’t that sick?
It's been over two years.
And I still remember how your back felt when you were half-asleep.
I still remember the weight of your silence
when you were trying not to cry.

You were home.
And no one tells you what to do
when your home becomes a locked door
you don’t have the key to anymore.

I’ve tried.
I’ve gone on dates.
I’ve let other people make me laugh.
I’ve let them hold me.
But every time, I feel like I’m cheating-
not on you,
but on the memory of who I was
when you loved me.

And maybe that’s the hardest part.
That I was the best version of myself
when you were around.
And I don’t know who I am without you.

I miss you.
God.
It’s pathetic.
I miss you like you died.
But you didn’t.
You’re just out there
living a life where I don’t exist.
Loving someone else.
Laughing with her the way you used to laugh with me.
Touching her the way you used to touch me.
And somehow, I’m supposed to be okay with that.

Everyone tells me time heals.
They don’t tell you what to do
when time just makes it quieter.
Not better.
Not healed.
Not easier.
Just…
quieter.

I don’t want to die.
But I also don’t want to live like this.
Waking up every morning with your name
still echoing in my chest.

I’m tired.
Not of life.
Just of carrying you around
like some secret grief
no one understands.
Because no one ever saw
how deeply I loved you.
They don’t know
you were my beginning and my undoing
at the same time.

And maybe I shouldn’t have met you.
But if I didn’t,
I’d never know how rare it is
to love someone with every part of yourself
and lose them anyway.

You’re happy now.
That should be enough for me.
But it’s not.
Because I’m still here,
waiting for a heart
that doesn’t beat for me anymore.

And I don’t know how to stop.",2,1745955349.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

My best friend is also Ethiopian and a chef. My husband also knows how to cook)…also I was born in DC (so many Ethiopians there) and maybe it would be easier to get the spices and certain products shipped from there (not sure about the laws for spices and ingredients).

We were dating for a little over three years before moving in together, and have been living together for a month or so now. Going in I knew he had mental issues that had gone untreated, in our relationship before and now I have done my best to be there for him. As someone who grew up heavily abused till the age of 14 when CPS finally got me, I understand what a panic attack is and how not to make it worse. 

I had the privilege and good fortune to have therapy over the span of several years which helped me greatly in learning how to better cope and manage bad days. I've suggested it to him once or twice, as have several of his friends, but he continuously refuses. Cites that since he's going to age out of his father's insurance why experience something only to lose it immediately after. I've done my best not to pressure him regarding this issue, but on occasion when it came up offered to help pay or find insurances that would help cover the cost. 

I'm getting increasingly worried about him. His sleep schedule is nearly nocturnal and horribly inconsistent, he has panic attacks on a near biweekly basis, his moods are volatile, and though his anger is fleeting and never directed at me- it sometimes frightens me. I know the latter is my own ptsd as he has never physically harmed me, and genuinely is one of the nicest most considerate guys I've met. But more than once his panic attacks have woken me from sleep and I had to talk him down, or i come in and he's physically beating his own head.

He helps me so much when I'm having an off day, makes me laugh like no one else, makes a mean cup of coffee, and loves me with the gentlest kindness. He is by no means abusive, rest assured- he has never acted violently towards me. My roomates and family all love him, and i do to. 

I'm mostly worried for his own well being, but I also can't stand living in such a volatile living space again. I'm being patient and doing my best to keep my own issues at bay, i know how to handle them. How do I encourage him to seek therapy for his own sake and mine?

1kawpef,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/comments/1kawpef/disclosure_disclosure_disclosure/,"Disclosure, disclosure, disclosure","I (31F) was diagnosed with HSV-2 several years ago and since then have been very selective about intimacy. Despite having type 2, I’ve only ever had outbreaks on my arm or tummy, which went away quickly with medication, and I haven’t had an outbreak in years. Until recently, I hadn’t been sexually active since last summer (with someone I dated in 2022 so already knew about my status), and hadn’t had to disclose to someone since 2023. Thankfully, disclosure never stopped a partner in my past, and as far as I know, I’ve never transmitted to a partner. Because of all this, my status hadn’t been on my mind or something I’ve thought about in a long time (yay!). 

However, a month ago I met someone (29NB) and felt an instant connection, safety, and alignment I’ve never experienced before — according to them, they felt the same way. Our first date was going extremely well and we ended up moving things to their bedroom (unusual for us both). Because of how quickly it all happened, and how I wasn’t expecting or even considering sex on the first date (we met for coffee in the morning), disclosure hadn’t come to mind for me until they were about to go down on me and paused to ask about testing. I realized what I had allowed to happen and immediately disclosed and apologized for not doing so sooner. They were kind and calm about it, and we switched to cuddling for an hour or so before they drove me home. 

Over the following weeks we continued to see each other whenever we could (no sex but lots of making out and cuddling), text consistently every day about nothing and everything, talk about my HSV experience, and build our feelings for each other. But the way disclosure happened was a roadblock, because they couldn’t get past “what if” they hadn’t stopped in that moment and asked — would I have told them? I’d like to think I would’ve snapped back to reality and done so before they actually put their mouth on me, but I honestly don’t know. It’s been eating me up inside since that first date, and I’ve talked about it extensively with my counsellor (who also happens to be an HSV expert). 

Last night they ended things, and left me with the impression that if I had been proactive about disclosure, we would still be together. They said the medical aspect wasn’t an issue; they understand where I was coming from, why my disclosure happened the way it did, and don’t fault me for it, but it was still a problem for them. They know the “what if” would hang over them, causing anxiety that would prevent them from being their best self in the relationship, so they thought breaking up was the right choice as that wouldn’t be fair to either of us. It was a deeply emotional, tear-filled evening for us both that’s left me feeling raw and like I fucked up majorly. I know we weren’t together long, but there was so much emotional intimacy, safety, consistent and honest communication, and alignment of values/life goals that I was feeling like I’d found my person. Now I feel hollow. They’re desperate to keep me in their life and be friends, but I need time and space to work through my feelings and get over them (and I think they should take that time too — lesbians are famously good friends with our exes, but if we get there I want it to be healthy for us both without lingering feelings). 

I guess I wanted to vent to people who might understand how I’m feeling. And share that I learned an extremely important lesson I’ll never forget, which I hope will resonate with someone.

I decided to pray to Lord Apollo and ask for my shoe to be fully untied by the time I reached Dunkin’ Donuts and if it was I’d buy a coffee. My shoe was untied by the time I got there. I was a little skeptical on if it was Lord Apollo or my shoe itself so I took out a coin and prayed for it to be heads if I should get a coffee. It was heads. I still wasn’t sure so I flipped that coin no less than 5 times and it was heads each time. I was still just a little skeptical so I asked for tails. It was tails.

We’re two internationals (a guy, 29, and a girl, 25) living in Paris, and honestly… making friends here hasn’t been the easiest. So we’re starting a casual group for English speakers who just want to meet cool people and hang out.

If you’re new here, or just feel like it’s been hard to connect (especially without perfect French), you’re definitely not alone. We’re hoping to create a group where people can meet up for coffee, drinks, walks — whatever — and actually build real friendships.

If you’re interested, just send me a quick message with your age and nationality — and you’re in!
Feel free to invite your friends too. The more, the better!

Not sure I ever finished it.  
*(Thriller/Horror, \~260 words)*

The bells over the café door jangled twice when he stepped inside with a quick stutter, like an echo tripping over itself.  
The smell hit him first: scorched coffee, wet paint, and something sour underneath. He didn’t remember it ever smelling like that.

His eyes caught it immediately on the fourth item down:  
*Wynn’s Special — $5.25*  
He stared.  
*I don’t have a special.*

Behind the counter, a woman in her fifties with a red bandana and an easy smile caught his eye and lit up.  
""Auggie Wynn,"" she said, wiping her hands on her apron like she’d been waiting years. ""Look at you. We were wonderin’ when you’d wander home.""

It scraped something raw inside him. He smiled automatically, the kind you give at funerals, and ordered a black coffee, foregoing small talk.

The woman poured it fresh, humming a tune he couldn’t place. When she turned to ring him up, August glanced back at the blackboard.

The “Wynn’s Special” was gone.

He blinked hard.  
*Just tired from the long drive. Just rattled.*

He paid cash and stepped back out into the sunlight, coffee burning the chill off his palms.

Everywhere he moved, heads turned half a beat late. Smiles arrived too soon or too wide. The street felt too narrow now. The sun too heavy. His name stuck to the air like a scent he couldn’t scrub off. Halfway down the block, he caught himself glancing at the shopfront windows. Watching himself walk. Making sure he was still there.

As someone who frequently adjusts their media setup and swaps between living room and bedroom TVs, a universal stand seemed like an excellent solution. Here’s my experience after testing it for my 40-inch LED TV and my friend’s 65-inch OLED TV.

**Overall Design and Build Quality**

This TV stand impressed me right out of the box. Its sleek black design, enhanced by the sturdy metal frame, gives off a modern, premium vibe. Honestly, it looks just as professional as some of the higher-end models I’ve encountered at tech stores. Weighing a solid 5.21 pounds, the stand feels robust without being unwieldy. While assembling it, I couldn’t help but notice the carefully machined parts and neat finishing – it screams durability. It’s worth mentioning that the stand includes 3mm feet pads to protect your furniture and prevent scratches. With these little extras, it caters to households like mine where hardwood floors and cabinet shelves are a concern. One minor aesthetic note is that it does tend to show dust and fingerprints on its metal surface, but that’s manageable with routine cleaning.

**Flexibility in Adjustments**

I’m a sucker for versatility, and this stand delivers. The two-level height adjustment allowed me to customize the viewing angle depending on the seating arrangement. When I placed it in my living room, raising the height to its maximum made watching from the couch much more comfortable. For my bedroom TV setup, lowering it worked perfectly for when I’m lying down. Despite being marked as stationary in terms of movement, the adjustable height feature compensates immensely for that. Moreover, the compatibility with VESA sizes ranging from 75x75mm to 800x500mm makes it a real contender for various TV models. This specificity of fit gave me peace of mind, knowing my 65-inch test TV would remain snug and secure.

[Check Suptek ML1760 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b08pp3tbhn/)

**Installation Experience**

Setting this up was smoother than making my morning coffee. Suptek wasn’t kidding about the ""20 minutes to install it"" claim. The user manual was surprisingly clear, with instructions that even the least tech-savvy person could follow. The included mounting hardware kit had all the bits and bobs needed, from screws to washers, which minimized trips to the toolbox or hardware store. However, you should ensure you have a screwdriver on hand since one isn’t included. Once assembled, the stand held the TV firmly and confidently, with no wobbling or shaky movements—a huge relief for me since I live with a mischievous pet that loves knocking things around.

**Positives**

This universal TV stand has numerous merits to consider:

- Wide compatibility range, supporting TVs between 20 and 65 inches.  
- Durable yet sleek metal construction that blends well with modern decor.  
- Easy installation process, saving time and effort.  
- The inclusion of protective floor pads minimizes potential floor or cabinet damage.  

**Areas for Improvement**

While the stand performs exceptionally, it does have its shortcomings:

- The metal surface is prone to visible fingerprints and dust accumulation.  
- Lack of swivel or tilt options can be limiting for some viewing setups.  
- No included screwdriver might inconvenience some users during assembly.  

**Other Options Worth Considering**

When comparing this product to its competitors, some alternatives stood out. For instance, PERLESMITH offers a similarly universal stand that features an integrated cable management system, an edge where the Suptek stand falls short. Another strong contender is the WALI TV Stand, known for its broader height adjustment range and a sturdier base when supporting heavier TVs. However, brands like PERLESMITH and WALI typically come at a slightly higher price point. The Suptek stand holds its ground well by balancing affordability with excellent build quality, making it an ideal mid-range option. For anyone prioritizing clean aesthetics over extensive adjustability, this TV stand has the edge.

**Value Proposition**

Speaking of affordability, this stand offers top-notch **bang for the buck**. For the features it provides—like flexibility in height, durable materials, and a universally accommodating VESA range—the price feels well-justified. Even when compared to pricier models, the Suptek ML1760 punches above its weight without compromising on safety or reliability. If you’re in search of a product with great cost efficiency that doesn’t skimp on the essentials, this one’s a strong contender.

It’s been three months since Mr. Roberts fired me for falling asleep while “working” for him.

He paid me to watch him sleep. It wasn’t a sex thing… honestly. He just needed someone awake in the room with him while he slept. He said it was a medical issue, but on my last day, I had a bit of a cold. The medication I was on made me drowsy, and I dozed off for a few minutes.

He wasn’t mad. Actually, he was apologetic. I didn’t understand why at the time, but now I do.

It started as that fleeting sensation of falling you sometimes get when you’re about to drift off—the kind that jolts you awake. Annoying, but nothing to worry about… right?

But then it kept happening. Every night. Every time I closed my eyes, the sudden drop yanked me back to consciousness. For almost two weeks, it disrupted every attempt at sleep. I figured it was stress—studies, work, life in general—but I was wrong.

At the two-week mark, the noises started. Strange, untraceable noises. Not quite breathing, but not not breathing. I know that doesn’t make sense, but that’s the only way I can describe it.

Another two weeks passed. The sounds continued, and then came the feeling.

The distinct, inescapable feeling that I wasn’t alone.

You know that sensation—when someone is in the room with you, even if you can’t see them? The air changes. The weight of the space around you shifts.

But when I looked? Nothing.

I turned on the lights. Checked the closet. Under the bed, even. But there was no one there.

Yet, the feeling never left.

After a week of this, I was exhausted. Unlike the jolts or the noises, this feeling didn’t fade once I was awake. It lingered, keeping me from falling back asleep at all.

I was barely functioning. My coursework suffered, and I was fired from my new job for a lack of concentration. It should have taken me less time to think back to Mr. Roberts, but given my sleep-deprived state, I gave myself a pass.

Mr. Roberts had said something to me as I left on my last day.

“You need to find someone to watch you sleep.”

He knew.

He knew this was going to happen to me because it had happened to him.

But unlike me, he had figured out how to stop it. By paying someone to watch him.

I, unfortunately, can’t afford that luxury.

I need answers. I grab my phone, scrolling back eight weeks to the day I first called Mr. Roberts about the job. I never delete anything, so the number is still there. I press Call.

It rings. No answer.

Is he dodging me? Maybe he’s just not home, after all it was a landline…

This can’t wait. I grab my coat and head out.

40 minutes later…

I’m standing on Mr. Roberts’ front porch, staring at his door.

How am I going to explain this? Hey, remember me? I think you cursed me with your weird sleep thing.

Yeah, that’ll go over well.

I look like shit. My eyes are open through sheer force of will alone. He’s either going to think I’m insane or… worse… he’s going to believe me.

I don’t know which possibility is more terrifying.

I ring the bell.

Seconds later, the door opens.

Mr. Roberts stares at me for a long moment. He looks… well. Really well.

“You,” he says, almost sadly.

“Please help me,” I beg, my voice cracking.

His expression softens. “Come in. Let me explain.”

Mr. Roberts returns from the kitchen with a steaming cup of coffee and hands it to me.

“It’s extra strong,” he mutters, avoiding my gaze.

“Thanks,” I say, taking a sip.

He exhales slowly, then speaks.

“I’m so sorry this is happening to you. I never wanted this. I was very clear about not falling asleep while I was sleeping.”

I nod, waiting.

“The thing attached to me about six months before we met. I was on vacation in Japan when I visited a shrine inside a beautiful temple. I fell while walking through a passage and broke a small clay vase.”

He glances at his bookshelf, walks over, and pulls out a hardcover book titled Demonology. Flipping through the pages, he finally turns the book toward me.

“The Baku. It’s a sleep demon. The legends say it feeds on nightmares, but after experiencing what I assume you have been going through, I dug deeper.”

He taps a passage in the book.

“This one is like a parasite. It torments its prey, keeping them from the dream world until they either die… or pass it on.”

My stomach knots.

“After the noises and the feeling of being watched,” he continues, “you’ll start seeing its eyes. Usually in the corners. The ceiling. Then it will touch you.”

His expression darkens. “After the touching comes the biting. The scratching. The burning.”

He closes his eyes and lifts his shirt.

His back is covered in burn scars.

Then he rolls up his sleeves—deep, jagged scratches run along his arms, alongside what can only be bite marks.

I swallow hard.

“How did I get it?” I whisper.

“You fell asleep while watching me,” he says grimly. “It saw you enter the dream world and latched onto you.”

I squeeze my eyes shut, trying to process.

“The only way to keep it at bay,” he continues, “is to have someone watch you.”

I shake my head. “I can’t afford to pay someone. And I won’t pass this on to someone else. There has to be a way to remove it.”

“It’s not a curse,” he says, flipping the book around again. “It’s a parasite. A leech.”

I stand suddenly, my chair scraping against the floor.

“I can’t—I won’t do this. I just can’t.”

“Wait,” he urges. “Let me watch you sleep tonight. At least you’ll face tomorrow rested.”

I hesitate. Then nod.

“Thank you,” I whisper.

The next morning…

I feel like I’ve actually slept for the first time in my life.

Processing everything from the night before, I leave Mr. Roberts’ house and head home.

On the subway, an idea forms in my mind.

I don’t like it.

I definitely won’t come off as sane.

But I have to try something.

That night, I set up my camera, adjusting the angle until it captures my entire bed.

I plug my laptop in. Open a streaming site.

I hover over the Go Live button.

My stomach turns, but I have no other choice.

I title the stream: “Watch Me Sleep.”

And I pray that somewhere out there, a stranger is willing to watch.

1kaw7rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1kaw7rk/a_stalker_horror_game_where_the_protagonist_is_a/,A stalker horror game where the protagonist is a Grandmother,"the basics of the idea is that you play as a elderly, recently retired woman who decides to spend the rest of her days in a large wooden cabin in the middle of a huge forest and one day is stalked and tries to escape her isolated home.

Basic story: The story would be set in a large forest and mountain filled location in the year 1999. the protagonist would be a 70 year old woman (who i’ll call Mary for now) has recently lost her husband due to a sickness. When she retires she decides to use her left over money to buy a large wooden cabin in a forest to connect with nature more.

THE FIRST DAY: she would go on a hike on a local trail to explore the area and while walking passes bye and briefly greets a fellow hiker (their interaction would be very short so that the person who plays wouldn’t suspect anything) then keeps on walking to she finds a nice small lake and takes in the view for a couple of hours. then she returns home and meets the same hiker sitting on a bench but doesn’t acknowledge him. Then at home she turns off all the lights and sleeps.

TIME SKIP TO ONE WEEK HAVING PAST: the protagonist is bored and decides to revisit the same lake but takes a different path due to a recent storm having blocked off the normal path. however she internally explains that this is a pretty private and unknown path so it would be unlikely that anyone would be on. Then halfway through the hike, she decides to take a break on a fallen tree (and maybe has some coffee), then jumpscare the same hiker randomly appears from the forest and greets the protagonist and starts up a conversation. the hiker introduces themselves as Dan and our protagonist introduces themselves, Dan would go on and ask questions such as “where do you live?… do you live alone? how old are you?… do you have any pets?” etc. Mary would answer honestly and Dan would chuckle in a somewhat strange way. You would start to feel uncomfortable so say that you have to be getting home and leave and say “see you soon” and for fear factor, he would respond “oh we sure will” while creepily staring at you while you leave.

SAME DAY AT THE HOUSE (NIGHT TIME): the protagonist will  be preparing to get into bed and walks upstairs, then Mary will trip and hurt her ankle (this will cause any movement done by the player to be slower so adding difficulty), she will call her son (who we’ll call john) and say that she has injured herself and needs help getting to the hospital, he replies by saying “It’s too late now I’ll pick you up early in the morning” and Mary also mentions the strange interaction with Dave, but John replies with “don’t wory just relax and enjoy retirement” then hangs up. She then slowly gets upstairs and into bed. she drifts to sleep and is still somewhat thinking about the strange encounter. she falls asleep.

4 AM NEXT DAY: Mary wakes up to a large thunderstorm outside her house and decides to go downstairs to get a drink, when she tries to turn on a light it doesn’t work so she assumes the power went out. as she slowly walks out of the bedroom, she hears a loud crash as if it came from a window. Then shr hears footsteps creaking the ground and after waiting, she sees the silhouette of a man and realises its Dan from the other day. From this point on the player would try and reach the fuse box and restore the power to call for help, however it would be slowed due to her injury so everything would be done at walking speed.

AFTER THE PLAYER HAS RESTORED POWER AND CALLED FOR HELP: She runs outside her house to hopefully buy some time till people get there, but she is stopped by the sound of a shotgun being clocked and is held up against a tree, just before she is shot a man shouts stop  “D@ck head” and shoots the stalker, after a moment we realise its John and you two embrace and it does a pan upwards into the sky.

IN A HOSPITAL BED: the protagonist sits in a hospital bed watching the news in where the (alive) stalker has been taken into custody a and is revealed to be a mass murderer who had killed approximately 12 elderly men and women who lived alone in the woods (and their real name is revealed as “blank”), then it cuts to credits.

Author’s note: it would be a fears to fathom style game and would probably take 1-2 hours to beat. If the game idea is made a reality, can I be made notified as i want to play it and maybe help assist make it. Thanks for reading ;)",2,1745953854.0,gameideas,0,1.0,False

I’m doing a little market research and would love your input!

I’ve got dreams of opening a coffee shop soon think amazing drinks, good ass food, and fun community events. But here’s the kicker location!!!!! While Dayton isn’t totally overrun with coffee spots, the ratio of great coffee shops to people is pretty low.

So I’m reaching out to locals beside myself, who know the area best. Are there any neighborhoods (in or around Dayton) that are seriously lacking a go to coffee shop? A place that serves bomb coffee, tasty bites, and hosts fun events?

Any tips, suggestions, or areas I should check out? I’d truly appreciate it! Thanks so much in advance!  means the world to me ☕️🖤",1,1745953773.0,dayton,22,0.55,False

Still going strong but...,"Hey everyone I'm back again this is the 4th update on my journey. Like I said I'm making this a weekly update to keep myself accountable and share my experiences on the way. If you want to see it from the beginning just check my name and posts. Anyway onwards.

I will share a struggle point that I didn't see coming but it hit and at the worst time. So here's the set up, just to give you a clear picture, I had planned a day with my wife. I wanted it to be special so the plan was to watch the sunrise near where I used to see it every morning when we first met, next breakfast at a restaurant I've always loved, then a bit of nature hiking, and finally a tour that we've wanted to do but never did. So sunrise went great breakfast is where I ended up fucking up and fucking up big time.
It started innocently enough, we sat down the waitress comes over and gets our drink orders and I look her up and down, in my head it was innocent enough, just sizing up a person I didn't know. We were enjoying the initial coffee and tea chatting and then the waitress comes back with some food and truth be told I don't really remember when it started but I started checking out the waitress, specifically her butt. I can recall three instances in specific, but my wife told me I was checking her out pretty much the entire time. Big fuck up on my part and the part that sucks the most about it is I barely registered I was doing it. I felt like complete shit for doing that to my wife. It was supposed to be a special day for us and I'm sitting there looking over her shoulder at some random waitress's ass... Talk about piece of shit moment to disrespect the woman I love like that. And what makes it even worse is she shared that I was doing it to random women as we were walking around as well, one I can remember doing a double take at but besides that, no memory of others. We did fight about it mainly because I had the gut reaction of trying to defend and play down my fault instead of sitting in the guilt and just having the ""fuck, I'm sorry, I fucked up"". I triggered her through my stupid wandering eye. We eventually worked out to a ok point in it but shit like this just retriggers all of the hurt I have put her through. 

Let me be clear, when I'm out running errands and shit do I see people, sure, but I have been really good at seeing them as just people passing by, no double takes, no checking them out. Just people, just acknowledging them as, avoid running into them or oh the said something politely respond, that person smiled my way token smile back and move on. I don't know why this day was different but it gave me a clear sign that I've still got some work to do. So we resolved that for now I'll try to make plans, if we are going out, to be around as few people as possible till I feel I've got a better handle on it. 

A positive that came from this was three fold. 

One I asked my therapist for perhaps some books that might help. The one they suggested, was very religious based but there were some good points in it. One that stuck with me is the ""wife cam"" aka imagine that no matter where you are or what you are doing your partner can see it from every angle. In those moments you are questioning if it's right imagine what your partner would think in that moment. If you think they would be hurt or insulted or see anything as inappropriate in that moment, change it, then and there in that split second. None of this ""well she's not around, where's the harm"" bullshit. If you follow that train of thought then you are mentally making it acceptable, and it's just not if it's going to hurt them... 

Number two was by happen stance I got a preview of another book (this was on audible if you're wondering) ""Sex Addiction: The Partner's perspective"" I liked what I heard and decided to just do it. Partially to understand her side of things but the first section surprised me. It talked about what it is to be a sex addict, keep in mind that sex addict is a blanket term yes it includes being addicted to porn, there were 10 questions, if you answered yes to 5 or more, you're likely a sex addict. I answered yes to 8... It also described the addiction cycle. As it described the stages of the cycle things made sense.

 Simply put
1. triggers - the thing that starts the thought 
2. Disassociating/urges - where in your head you start pulling away from rational thought of, no that thing is bad and you shouldn't do it, instead you switch over to the addiction brain of ""it's just a little, just a glimpse, etc""
3.preperaption/fantasy/ritual - this is where you start thinking about doing the thing and figuring out how, which yes can be as simple as turning on the computer. This is where your brain blocks out the negative effects of it and you start living in the fantasy of it won't have reproductions and isn't bad.
4. Acting out - This is where you, you guessed it, do the thing, for a porn addict this is where you indulge. This could be a few minutes or days the time it takes doesn't change it. It could be a 5 minute fap or a week long all day every day. 
5. Shame/guilt/remorse - this is when you finally break out of the fantasy world you've put your self into and feel the guilt and shame for doing it... What I'm pretty sure at least most people here have felt and are here to try and get away from.

This is a cycle. This is the process that addicts go through. This is the swearing it off, never doing it again, just to relapse a day, week, month, whatever later. Does it sound familiar? Yeah did to me too. 

So take a moment and realize, yes it is an addiction. Take a second to just let that sink in. Now do you know why it's such a hard thing to break? This is the reason there's are addiction groups dedicated to ""sex addiction"" like sex addicts anonymous. Remember how I mentioned sex addict is a blanket term. Yeah. While psychology is still arguing if it's a real thing or not their are hundreds of thousands of us, in this thread, that feel it every day, and it's growing all the time. So, yeah, it's a real fucking thing. 

And finally number three, you thought I forgot didn't you, I realized I needed to switch therapists to someone better suited to help with porn addiction and mending relationships. The one I had been talking to even agreed after I brought up that I wanted to focus on why I was seeking help. The two points above. My next session with my new therapist is next Monday. Hopefully this will be better. 

Let's end this one on some positive notes. 

Personal changes. I have a lot more energy and more drive to do things. My emotions, while a little unpredictable at times, are much more present in both good and bad, but the key take away is they don't feel numbed or dull. I'm getting a hell of a lot more done. The few times I have had sex with my wife, I've felt present, in the moment, all about us and what's happening, which is a metric fuck ton more enjoyable, not to say it wasn't great before but holy shit I didn't realize. It's like feeling like a teenager getting some before he knew what porn was. The anticipation, the emotional connection, the sensitivity... Ok you get the point. Moving on. Much clearer mind, my brain feels less cluttered if that makes sense. Small things are more enjoyable and bring me happiness. I feel more accomplished when I do things. 

Yeah there's a lot going on but I think this is a good point to wrap it up. Thanks for coming to my ted talk I hope you have learned something today. As usual comments and questions are totally welcome, you know what to do... 

And this is for anyone out there struggling. This isn't fucking easy. No matter if you've been in it a few months or 30 years. It is an addiction. It's hard to take the path to quitting. But it is fucking worth it. Just take it a day at a time and be proud of that day and the next and the next. If you slip, pick your self back up and do it again, get further the next time. One day you'll look back and see the days, weeks, months, even years, and be able to say ""I fucking did it and I'm proud of myself and who I've become"" so next time you feel that urge, just say ""yeah fuck you brain, I'm going to do something else"" you'll get there if you keep determined. You're stronger than that shit.

Thanks in advance for anyone offering productive input.

I have an existing website that I have produced content for for about 10 years, completely free of charge.  My content is basically a few high-res photos, followed by about a page or two of written content pertaining to the photos.  I have a unique niche and my website garners significant amount of website traffic.  I believe that if I were selling high quality, hardcover coffee-table style books with this content that I'd be able to successfully market them on my website as is--no print-on-demand needed or similar services.  
  
However, I do need help formatting my content into an aesthetically appealing coffee book.  For example, I don't want to just slap a few photos on a page with blobs of text to follow.  I'd like it tastefully and aesthetically formatted.  
  
I've already gotten very competitive quotes from printers like Print Ninja and others.  So, from a financial standpoint, I am ready to take the leap of faith and get this printed so I can sell it on my own.    

I need someone to format this book.  Cover design seems relatively straight-forward, and there are many freelance designers on fiverr and other such websites that I am sure could produce the quality I am after.  

Finding someone to format a book like this in a high quality manner has not been so easy.

A self-publisher quoted me at $1500 for this service, but I read many mixed reviews about them and their services on reddit and elsewhere.  I asked if I could see examples of their formatting, and they suggested I purchase some of the books they published.  It strikes me as....not right, that I need to pay money to someone just to see if their work is up to par.  I wouldn't pay a plumber for some plumbing work, prior to paying him for more plumbing work just to see if he's any good, if you see what I mean....I'd ask to see past examples or happy customers, and usually I could see pictures of his previous jobs to instill confidence.

I am seeking advice, or any other resources that might get me connected to someone who can format this book.  Simply searching for ""book format freelancers"" has been tough, as people seem to either publish purely photographic books (like mementos from a wedding) or purely textual books like novels.  Mine is a coffee table book somewhere in the middle and maybe I am searching for the wrong things.

Any useful and productive input appreciated.  Thank you!",1,1745953278.0,selfpublish,4,1.0,False

1kavycu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kavycu/are_bardrinking_dates_a_red_flag_within_serious/,Are bar/drinking dates a red flag within serious dating?,"So I (31F) am not currently in the dating scene but am emotionally and mentally preparing myself to eventually head back to it when more ready, and I wanted some opinions. 

I have had quite a few men whose idea for first meet ups or dates (where we've never met before) is to get drinks together at a bar, take a shot together, etc. It has been a very common theme and it has always felt like an underhanded foot in the door to try and hookup rather than being a serious date. Between it being somewhere very casual and dark, into the evening time, and doing something that lowers inhibitions and often enhances women's sexual interest, while also being the perfect transition into the end of the night/going back to ones place for the night. It has just always felt like the easiest set up to try and hookup with someone. 

In my past with online dating, I had rules for myself. A phone call first, and then public morning/afternoon dates only- like getting breakfast, a coffee, or going for a walk in the park. Why? Because I really didn't trust anyone who wanted to do the previous and i've had some really awful and uncomfortable dates. It's harder to naturally transition a breakfast or lunch date into a casual let's go back to my place statement. 

Anyways, I want to know whether the night time drinking dates are actually a red flag, or if  I'm being too quick to judge it? Am I misplacing this as a red flag? I usually don't just stop talking to a man over it, but I'll redirect it to saying that I'd prefer a morning or afternoon date. Lol however, I don't know if I should even be redirecting it, or instead taking it as a red flag for them having suggested it in the first place.

I'd like opinions. Thank you :)

Edit: I should probably express that I also have trauma and diagnosed PTSD related to men, so that could be of influence here 😬",0,1745953217.0,dating_advice,61,0.5,False

When I originally joined the National Guard, I expected to be doing major traffic control or helping out in the aftermath of natural disasters. God knows tornadoes are prominent here. But nothing could have prepared me for anything that had happened. If you are reading this, don't go to St. Grace, Missouri! They have it quarantined for a reason. The only thing curiosity is going to do is get you killed. People go in. They don't come back. You may as well walk into a giant meat grinder; hell, at least it's quicker. The only thing that will solve any of this will be mass extermination, leaving no trace of life. Even eradicating Mother Nature's presence. St. Grace is gone, the businesses left have become a barren lobby of rooms claimed by twisting vines and thorny bushes, and people's homes have been taken and transformed into nests. It's nothing more than a green hell, mouth open, waiting for its next prey to crawl into its city-sized esophagus.  

 

I'm in the National Guard, have been training for about 8 months, and saw no real action until two weeks ago. I was sent to St. Grace, Missouri. Which wasn't a big surprise, as they have sent multiple squads already. It got quarantined about a month after I joined the National Guard, and little to no information has been sent to us or the public. Seems like every time I ever opened up my phone, it's always the same news stories, ""This has become a violation of our rights"" ""The government is becoming terrorists to their own cities"" or ""Justice for St. Grace."" The people even took to protesting outside some of the checkpoints, which made it harder to get through when my squad and I arrived. The protesters were throwing anything they had at the vehicle; one guy even went up to the passenger side door and tried to break the window with a jagged piece of cement he grabbed from the side of the road.  

 

""That rock's not doing shit, buddy!""  

 Sergeant chuckled, the first sound he made all day. Despite his generally stoic demeanor. ""Might as well be using a wet noodle on a tank,"" he added with that half-smile that rarely broke through his stony expression.  

 

After the crowd inevitably divided to make room for us, we stopped at the front gates. My sergeant gave the guard at the gate some identification and an envelope. Two other guys from my squad, Lucas and Caden, were still snacking on rolls we got from breakfast and snickering at each other, watching the protesters. Lucas spoke through a mouthful of bread.  

 

""It's been months by now, you would think they would start to understand that this protesting shit isn't going to do anything.""  

Caden, his partner-in-crime with that perpetual smirk of his, nudged Lucas with his elbow. ""Probably some dumb flat earthers looking for something new. I swear every conspiracy has the same five people in it, just with different tinfoil hats.""  

""Next week they'll be saying the government's turning birds into spies,"" Lucas snorted, crumbs spraying from his mouth.  

 

""Jesus, close your mouth when you chew,"" I groaned, brushing bread bits off my uniform.  

 

""And to be fair, people had to evacuate from their homes with no explanation. I would be pissed off too.""  

 

Lucas put on his stupid grin, swallowing down his food. “We might have to give you a tinfoil hat.”  

 

The guards gave my Sergeant his ID and opened the doors. It was about then I realized how well they've been quarantining this area. The road went straight and looked abandoned like it was a wasteland, nothing was around it besides some abandoned cars left on the side of the road, most accompanied by only 2 tires and shattered windshields.  

 

""We're going to head to the checkpoint at the hotel off of Highway 63."" Carly was holding a map out on her lap as she was helping our Sergeant navigate. Her usually perfect posture is momentarily relaxed as she traced routes with her fingertip. Still puzzles me why we have to use a map and not our phones with Google Maps. It's not like we're in some foreign country where reception is as hard to come by as diamonds.  

 

""Why can't we just use GPS?"" I asked, leaning forward between the seats.  

 

Carly's eyes didn't leave the map. ""Because it’s more reliable"" she replied, that authoritative tone making me sink back into my seat. Then, almost under her breath, ""Not everything needs to be solved by technology, Nick.""  

 

The smell of the lush trees filled my nostrils through the open car door window. However, the closer we got to the hotel, the rougher the roads started to get. I know the roads haven't had people repair them in months, but also no one has driven on these roads besides the occasional squad car. I wouldn't think the roads would be this rough already. Looking outside the window, you could see vines growing on some of the buildings, and trees in the middle of parking lots that grew from under them. I was in awe, stunned by how beautiful it looked, almost poetic watching nature take over and claim the abandoned homes and cars only able to be made by man, but also confused about how nature could grow over so quickly.  

 

""How many people do you think are still living here?""  

 

Our Sergeant looked at me from the rear-view mirror with the old serious demeanor he always has, the deep creases between his eyebrows becoming more pronounced. Man can't make a smile unless he's laughing at his own jokes.  

""I'm not sure, kid,"" he said, his eyes flicking back to the road. ""They spotted a few people in the middle of town though, couldn't tell if they were old residents or protesters."" He tightened his grip on the steering wheel. ""My guess is they’re just some dumb kids who got in somehow.""  

 

When we arrived at the hotel, I was surprised, to say the least. Didn't look like Mother Nature had claimed it much at all, probably due to other squads coming in and using this place as well and maintaining it. I and the two other guys started to grab our bags and equipment from the back seats.  

 

""Let's go, idiots,"" Carly said out of retaliation for us taking more than half a second to get out of the car, reminding me of my little brothers when they started to get annoyed at me. I could hear Lucas mumble something under his breath.  

 

""Bitch.""  

 

""What the hell did you say?"" Carly screamed, her face flushing red, filled with anger. Sarg couldn't help but chuckle to himself as he walked to the main doors.  

""I said of course,"" Lucas said sarcastically with a smile that annoyed even me. He has one of those shit-eating grins that either could make someone instantly like him or hate him, with those dimples that he swore made him irresistible.  

 

""Sure you did, pretty boy,"" Carly snapped, shouldering her pack.   

  

“I like to think I'm a very pretty boy.” I could feel the cringe physically hurt me from his reply.  

  

Walking out of the car, I could see that the squads before even chopped down some of the trees that were in the parking lot. There was a tree growing out of the base of the statue a few meters in front of the main entrance that they cut down halfway. Walking up to it, the cut of the trunk looked rough, and I could see other marks further down the trunk from attempts of trying to cut it down as it took them all their might to finally trim the damn thing.  

 

""You got the radio right Nick?"" Carly screamed from the car.  

 

""Yeah, I got it and the receiver thing,"" I yelled back, holding up the box.  

 

""Don't lose it like you lost your dignity when you cried watching 'Marley and Me,'"" Lucas called out, making Caden burst into laughter.  

 

""That was ONE time!"" I protested. ""And you cried too, you just wouldn't admit it.""  

""Did not.""  

""Your pillow was soaked, man."" Lucas shook his head as he went inside the hotel.  

I went to head inside myself but I noticed something that stopped me, the trunk of the tree had no rings. The trunk was not small either, about a foot and a half in diameter. I don't think a single tree in the entire world, synthetic or otherwise, could grow that thick in such a small time frame. Theories swarmed my mind but I went inside the hotel before Carly yelled at me. The interior was nothing fancy, it was clear they were going for a hunting lodge feel. Wood carvings of bears and birds were decorated all over the place, and the walls with a clean dark green finish. I set the radio and the receiver on the reception desk and dropped my bag on a couch in the back of the room claiming the seat. For the next hour, I watched Lucas and Caden try to connect the radio and get it to work, getting upset at each other when one of them did something wrong.  

 

""That's a YELLOW cable! Why would it go into the socket that is red?"" Lucas shouted,  He rapped his knuckles against Caden's forehead. ""Hello? Anyone home? Did you not learn your colors in kindergarten?!""  

""Well I don't know, maybe it's because there is no socket that's fucking yellow!"" Caden fired back, running his hand through his perpetually messy hair in frustration. ""Maybe if you'd stop barking orders and actually help, we'd have this set up already.""  

""I am helping. I'm helping by not letting you fry our only means of communication,"" Lucas muttered, shoving Caden aside. ""Just let me do it. Go be useful somewhere else.""  

""Why don't you both shut up and read the manual?"" I suggested, earning glares from both of them.  

Carly set her stuff on the couch next to the one I was lying on and took a seat, releasing a long sigh after the long trip we had taken. Did not help that me and the other guys wouldn't stop talking the whole way.  

""How are you doing Nick?"" I was shocked by her real attempt to start a conversation; to be honest I thought small talk was one of her biggest pet peeves.  

""Fine, but something about this place seems so off."" She gave a small smile, a rare crack in her usually stern facade.  

""Well that's why we're here, anyways Lucas and Caden are going to be looking out for tonight so make sure you sleep well."" I grabbed a Fanta I got from one of the soda machines which was probably expired. ""Are you sure the two protecting us for the night is a good idea? I mean they can't even stay serious at training.""  

 the more she seemed like she was having a good time.  

 

""Well, it's either volunteer to do so and feel like shit tomorrow, or get some actual good sleep at the cost of two idiots being the wall that protects me from life and death. I choose sleep."" She shrugged, stretching her legs out. ""Besides, they might be idiots, but they're the best idiots we got. I've seen Lucas take down guys twice his size in training.""  

Lucas and Caden started to drag a mattress from one of the rooms bringing them to the lobby and laid a blanket on it. They also brought energy drinks and chips scattered them around the mattress and sat the radio in the middle. Lookedlike the setup my brothers would have when they wanted to stay up all night in the living room and play Call of Duty Zombies.  

 

""It's like a middle school sleepover,"" I said, laughing at my own joke. ""All you guys need is a onesie and some ghost stories.""  

 

""Actually,"" Lucas called from across the room, ""we're setting up a strategic monitoring point while maintaining essential communications. Isn't that right, Caden?""  

 

""Absolutely,"" Caden nodded seriously. ""Very official military business happening here."" He cracked open an energy drink and took a long swig. ""Also, we were thinking of braiding each other's hair later."" I laughed, sinking deeper into the couch. For how annoying they could be, they’ve been one of the few people able to make me laugh for the last few months.  

I started thinking about my brothers though. I wonder if they're okay right now. Before I went to go on this mission, I left my oldest brother Cooper in charge and told him if anything was broken it was his ass on the line. I know he's responsible but he is still just 15, and I remember how I was back then. Usually play games with my friends online while being high on weed and eating Hot Pockets at 3 in the morning. My oldest brother isn't anything like I was, however, I've seen him almost burn our house down from microwaving macaroni and cheese in a cup and forgetting to put water in it. I remember the scent of burnt nail polish surrounding every crevasse and molding itself into the home for weeks.  

 

My youngest brother, Malachi, is more reserved. I’m worried about him because he doesn’t talk to many other peoplebesides me and occasionally Cooper. When he does talk to me, it’s usually people’s stories he would read on here. He would tell me scary stories inspired by the posts he would see. I used to joke to myself when I would watch him start making up details because parts of the story vanished from his mind. Now, glancing at some of these, I'm not sure if these are just stories. I wonder if he knew.  

  

When I woke up, Lucas was lingering over me. Holding freshly brewed coffee and extremely sleep-deprived. His normally bright eyes were bloodshot and half-closed. ""Wake up."" His voice was deep and crackly, straining to make any noise.  

""Jesus, you look like death,"" I muttered, sitting up and taking the coffee. ""Anything happened last night?""  

 

""Nothing,"" he yawned, stretching his arms over his head. ""Well, I thought I saw something moving in the trees around 3 AM, but it was probably just my brain melting from boredom.""  

Breakfast consisted of mediocre biscuits and 2 small lines of bacon. The coffee tasted like dirt and the scent was an assault to the nostrils. It was going to be about an hour until the sun rose, and the sky was filled in with a very dark blue, still displaying all the stars. Sarg started grabbing his stuff, methodically checking his gear with practiced precision.  

 

""Alright shitheads, let's get going into town before the sun comes up."" He slammed a magazine into his pistol with a sharp click. ""And for God's sake, try not to wander off when  

we get there like you do in training, Caden.""  

 

""That was literally ONE time,"" Caden protested, slinging his pack over his shoulder. ""And I was just following what I thought was a shortcut.""  

 

""That led you to your bed."" Lucas snickered.  

 

""Purely coincidental,"" Caden insisted, his ears turning red while pouring coffee into his thermos.  

 

I walked out of the hotel heading towards the car, rubbing my eyes. I wish I had taken advantage of the extra coffee. On the way to the car, I noticed something. The trunk, coming out of the statue. It’s scars from the last squad that tried to cut it down, it looked like healed wounds. The wood-filled in the chunks, but the bark still hadn't covered it. The splinters that came from the top of the trunk were now a smooth surface like the cut of the tree was with one clean swing. This must be why they quarantined the area. If nature could grow like this in town, maybe it could weaken the foundations of buildings and become a hazard, but then why keep it such a secret?  

 

We continued on the highway for a few minutes, but the number of cars that were on the side of the road was alarming, all of them ruined and covered in warping paint and rust. Ivy and vines claimed the bridges, replacing the concrete of its pillars. Birds and deer were wandering the deserted land and would watch us as we drove by like we were imposters coming into their territory. After a few minutes of driving on the highway, heading to town. We stopped at a 4-story parking garage. Walking out of the car the air felt heavy and moist, clinging to my skin like an invisible film.  

 

Lucas and Caden went up to the garage with a drone they got from the trunk to see if they could spot anyone. They raced each other all the way up the garage like we were in a track field, Caden's competitive spirit driving him forward despite his shorter legs.  

 

""Last one up gets to fly it first!"" Lucas called, already two steps ahead.  

 

""I don't fucking think so!"" Caden shouted back, huffing as he tried to keep pace.  

 

Apparently, the coffee and energy drinks were still lingering in their system and acting like they didn't just pull off an all-nighter. The sergeant directed me and Carly to go down the road and scout the area and see what we could find. The air between us was filled with an awkward silence. I met Carly about 2 or 3 weeks into my training, and she was just as quiet and serious back then. I'm pretty sure she was drinking the night before, she looked tired and drained, her usually perfect ponytail coming loose with strands falling around her face. We entered an alley that looked like a path to the back door of an old bakery. The place reeked of rot when we entered. Moldy loaves of bread and cakes still filled the storage rooms and the open displays in the front of the bakery. Carly couldn't even go inside without feeling like she was going to vomit. The windows were all barricaded and all the doors were locked. I yelled from inside ""Do you think some of those protesters camped in here?""  

 

All I heard in response was the sound of gagging drifting away, distancing from the mold-infused bakery. Sorry for the details but if I had to suffer that disgusting place and a nauseous Carly, so do you.  

 

A lot of the decorations were still intact. I could tell the owners were trying to go for a mother's kitchen kind of feel. The bottom of the walls were laid with brick and it had a white paint finish above it. Metal empty lanterns hung from the ceiling, with candles still inside. The sign with the prices was a chalkboard, however now it's all cracked or broken and one of the boards fell to the floor. I could imagine how cozy this place was, buying a croissant and a small cappuccino and looking out the glass window. St. Grace was a college town so every business's income was from students primarily. I only had a year of college life before I joined the National Guard. I told myself I joined because when I served my years, my college would be paid for by the government. However, in all honesty, I think I'm just plagued with uncertainty. Within a year I changed my major three times. I originally went with a Political Science major, but that changed within the first few weeks. Then it was a Business major because my father told me it was the only one that mattered. But within a few months after that, I rebelled against my father's suggestion and went for an English major.  

 

""Business major? Really?"" my father had said when I told him I'd switched from Political Science. ""That's the only degree worth a damn these days.""  

 

""Yes, Dad,"" I'd replied, the words tasting like cardboard. ""I know."" Three months later I'd called him again.  

 

""English?"" he'd exploded. ""What the hell are you going to do with an English degree except ask people if they want fries with that?""  

 

""Maybe I'll write the great American novel,"" I'd said, knowing it would get under his skin.  

The silence had stretched for so long that I thought he'd hung up.  

 

""Your mother would be disappointed,"" he'd finally said, his voice low and cutting.  

 

""Low blow, Dad,"" I'd whispered, ending the call.  

 

Sadly I didn’t enjoy any of those majors, definitely hated studying business. But growing up we were extremely poorand I didn't want to start a family with no money however I haven't dated someone since my freshman year of high school and that was just a date so I don't even know why I'm thinking about starting a family. I didn't and still don't know what I want to do with my life. I hope whatever it is...It makes me a lot of money so I can finally be happy.  

 

I went through the entire bakery, cabinets, and all and the only thing that stood out were some soup cans that were deserted by their owner. Unopened but expired about 5 months ago. Looking up from behind the counter, I saw something outside the main windows of the bakery. The window was only barricaded by 3 wooden boards. So I was still able to see a deer in the middle of the road. It was looking right at me, its head unnaturally still. I thought it was adorable until after a few seconds of it still staring at me, I started feeling a heavy weight of unease. I started to wonder how long it's been watching me. It started slowly raising its head, keeping its lifeless eyes locked on me—dark, glassy orbs that reflected no light. It didn't even look real like someone replaced the insides for a robot. It moved so slowly and never looked away like a security camera. Creeped out, I finally walked away. I could already feel the headache coming in from all the mold.  

 

When I walked out of the place, I found Carly sitting on the curb, supporting her drooping head with her hands looking at the ground. ""Do you need some water? I didn't eat all my breakfast if you want it?"" Carly looked up at me, looking worse than before.  

 

""Uhm, I'll have some water if you got it."" Her voice was raspy like each word scraped her throat on the way out. ""God, I feel like I've been hit by a truck.""  

 

I gave her my canteen and she grabbed Ibuprofen from her bag and took it with some of the water. I sat my bag down next to her and took a seat on the short curb, forcing my legs to either lay outward or raise my knees up towards my chin.  

 

""Nothing was in there besides some soup cans, no sign of anyone being in there recently.""  

She didn't reply but just kept staring down the street, chewing absently at her bottom lip like she was deep in thought. I didn't want to mention the deer because, well it's a deer in Missouri, it's nothing special in the grand scheme of things and I thought I was just being paranoid.   

 

""Did you sleep well?""  

 

She just sighed, the dark circles under her eyes answering my question.  

""Like a baby,"" she muttered sarcastically. ""If that baby had night terrors and insomnia."" She massaged her temples. ""Had the weirdest dreams. Kept seeing things moving in the trees, watching me. Took me hours to fall asleep.""  

We sat there in silence for a while, I started to realize how quiet it was. You couldn't hear a single bird chirp. There was little to no wind, and not even a croak of a frog or a distant squirrel on a telephone pole. The silence was suddenly broken by the speeding sound of the drone zooming right above us taking a sharp turn to go down another alleyway. I looked back at Carly,   

 

""Just uhh...let me know if you need anything okay?"" Carly nodded, reaching out to hand back the water but I rejected it, telling her to keep it.  

 

""Thanks, Nick,"" she said softly, a rare moment of vulnerability peeking through her tough facade. ""You're a good kid.""  

 

""I'm twenty-two,"" I protested with a small smile.  

 

""And I’m twenty-four, Like I said,"" she replied, her lips curving up slightly. ""A kid.""  

For the next few hours, we would break into homes and small stores, not a single sign of life besides the occasional food can and dead critter. Carly kept having to take a seat at every other place we searched. My walkie started going off.  

 

""Lucas and Caden didn't find anything, but they're going to camp out in the garage to continue searching.""  

 

It was Sarg back in the car. Me and Carly started retracing our steps back to the garage. She looked better than she was earlier that morning, she threw up about 2-3 times however and it was just as sickening as the mold in the bakery. I have a very weak stomach so I try not to think too hard about it. When we got to the car, we left 2 meal packs for Lucas and Caden, warned them to not be stupid, and started to head back to the hotel. Sarg was going through different stations on the radio and stopped on some station that only played songs from the 70's-90's. I couldn't recognize any of the music, but Sarg made sure I knew the exact song and the history behind it, his usually gruff voice softening with nostalgia.  

""Now this,"" he said, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel, ""this is real music. Not that auto-tuned garbage you kids listen to these days.""  

 

""Let me guess,"" I said, leaning forward. ""You walked uphill both ways to school too?""  

To my surprise, he laughed—a genuine, throaty chuckle that seemed to surprise even him.  

 

""You bet your ass I did. Barefoot, in the snow.""  

 

That entire car ride is the most I have ever heard the man talk, going on about the history behind the song ""One Toke Over the Line"" and how the duo who made it got on Richard Nixon's enemy list. Must have been one crazy life back then.  

When we got back to the hotel I hopped on the radio and reached out to the chaotic duo. ""Lucas and Caden you there?"" Took a few seconds for them to respond.  

 

""Yup, we just got done heating up our dinner and flying the drone around, and still haven't seen anything,"" I responded in a more sarcastic tone.  

 

""You're aware that thing isn't made to play around with and do dumb tricks right?"" I replied.  

 

""Are you aware that this is the only time I can fly a 20,000-dollar drone without some dipshit getting mad if I fly it more than 1 mile per hour?"" Lucas replied, that rebellious streak of his coming through. He wasn't entirely wrong, but if he crashes that drone it's 20,000 dollars he probably has to make up for.  

 

""Just don't be too stupid,"" I said, sounding like a father who knows when his kids are most definitely going to do something dumb.  

 

""Yes, Mom,"" Lucas drawled. ""We promise to be in bed by nine and brush our teeth.""  

 

""I'll even floss,"" Caden added. I could practically hear his grin through the radio.  

 

""I will say we've only been finding wildlife, raccoons and deer mostly. But even if they keep going back to the tree lines, I guess they don't even like being here.""  

They laughed, but when they said that I could not help but be overwhelmed with the feeling that I was being watched. Theories about what could be wrong with this place plagued and dwelled deep in my thoughts. I could see how nature could become a big hazard, but doesn't explain some of these buildings that are all boarded up. The people that sneak in here through those fences never get seen again, the fact that we were sent to find stragglers but we didn't find a single piece of evidence of someone being here recently. When they informed me about the mission before I left, they used those exact words, ""Stragglers."" What do they mean by stragglers, if they're referring to people before the quarantine why weren't they evacuated before? How could anyone be alive after 8 months in this place?  

 

Carly came over with a Red Bull from one of the vending machines, setting it on the desk. ""Do you think you could be on watch tonight?""  

 

I grabbed the drink and nodded. She stood there, looking guilty. ""I'm sorry I had to keep sitting out today, I think I was having a migraine or something."" She was looking better than earlier that day, some color returning to her pale cheeks from earlier. I replied saying   

""It's fine, I was just glad you didn't die of dehydration or get too annoyed by me."" She smiled and walked away, leaving the canteen I gave her on my couch before she went to hers and fell asleep. Sarg took the mattress that was left on the floor from the night before.  

Lucas and Caden only talked a few times throughout the night on the radio, always saying they spotted some animal or an interesting location that we should check out the next day, but still but no sight of anyone. I could feel the Red Bull draining away but I kept walking around to stay awake, clenching tight to my rifle. Around 1 am, Lucas hopped on the radio.  

 

""Hey, Caden already went to bed, and both the main battery and our backup one is dead. I guess we didn't do a good job keeping them fully charged."" His voice crackled through with that hint of sheepishness admitting his mistake.  

 

""It's dead quiet around here anyways. You should just go to bed.""  

 

Right then I noticed something outside the window towards the back of the lobby. The tree line behind the hotel was about 20 yards away from the window.  

 

""Yeah, I'll go to bed once I'm done packing up the drone and all. I'm guessing we'll be out searching again same time tomorrow.""  

 

More but I stopped listening. Out the window, through the back of the lobby, there was an elk just in front of the trees. I couldn't tell how big it was but its antlers seemed way bigger than they should've been—a massive crown of bone, too many points to count, spreading wider. It just kept staring at me and both of us refused to move a single inch. Suddenlythe outline of its antlers was getting even taller, it wasn't just growing, but it was standing up. The creature's front legs elongated, stretching impossibly as it rose on what should have been its hind legs. It must have been at least 10 feet high and I couldn't see its eyes but I knew it was looking right at me, sensing the primal fear radiating from my body.  

 

Suddenly, there was a very loud knocking on the main door of the hotel, frantically trying to enter.  

 

""LET ME THE FUCK IN!!!""  

 

I have no idea who it was but I was startled, to say the least, I dropped the microphone I was using to communicate with the others, and I could hear Lucas screaming through the headset, asking if I was okay in the background but I pointed my rifle right at the door and yelled. ""Who are you?""  

 

""JUST LET ME THE FUCK IN, THEY'RE OUT THERE!"" The voice was ragged, desperate—almost inhuman in its panic. Knocking even harder on the door.  

Carly by this point was already awake, frantically trying to find her pistol. I looked through the peephole and it definitely wasn't Lucas or Caden, he was wearing a tattered white shirt, and extremely shaggy jeans. I looked at Carly and she was already pointing her pistol at the door, looking at me shaking her head.  

""Don't you dare open that door, Nick,"" she hissed, her knuckles white around her pistol.   

I could see the window behind her though, no elk in sight. What if that's the “they’re” the man's talking about? My mind is telling me to do anything but open that door, what if that thing from outside gets in and kills us? Questions about whether I was hallucinating or going or going crazy swarmed my mind. What if the thing knocking at the door is what I saw outside? After what was only seconds of a thousand questions going through my mind, it was interrupted by the increasingly rapid knocking on the door.   

 

“Please let me in PLEASEEEE!” I could hear him breathing rapidly, his voice being interrupted by his sobbing.  

 

I couldn’t let that man stay out there, what the hell am I thinking, we’re literally here to help people who are stuck here. I hastily ignored the warnings from Carly and my head and swung open the door. Within seconds the man pushed me down, trying to grab my gun. He kept screaming a bunch of random shit like some crackhead going through withdraws.  

 

""FEAST! YOU'RE ONE OF THEM!""  

 

""Get OFF him!"" Carly screamed, her pistol shaking in her hands. ""I will shoot you!""  

I could feel him slamming his fists against my chest. His left hand was wrapped around my neck, pressing it against the floor, closing my airway. He looked extremely scrawny, you could see the waves of bone that were his ribs. He started to laugh as he slammed his head against my forehead. I didn't even realize that my gun was now on the floor away from me. My only mission was to get him down on the ground so we could at least restrain him. Carly stood there with her gun pointing at him, screaming to get off me. I doubt he even registered what she was saying, he kept mumbling to himself.  

 

""Dry bones to the moist Leafs.""   

 

""I won't I won't I won't.""   

 

""IT'LL KILL US ALL.""  

 

His eyes were wild, and bloodshot, darting frantically around the room like he was seeing things we couldn't.  

 

""The trees are watching,"" he whispered hoarsely while pressing his thumbs against my eyes and kneeing me in the gut. His voice suddenly dropped. ""They're hungry. They're always hungry."" He would suck on his fingers on his left hand as he would slam his fist on my throat, the whole time he was drooling all over me, like some rabid, hungry, animal finally about to have his first meal in days. He was desperate to kill me.  

 

I was conflicted, wondering if this is a man driven mad or just some crackhead. I did everything I could to get the man off, constantly wrestling with him on the floor. Suddenly, though within a second, I saw Sarg pull on the back of his shirt, tossing him off me, and a gunshot echoed through the hotel. Everything and everyone went quiet. The only noise I could hear was the ringing from Sarg, shooting the man right in the neck, and his thick skull slamming on the hard floor.  

 

When you get shot somewhere like the throat, you don't die instantly, and you don't gasp or scream. The only noise you make is the gargling of your blood clogging up and spewing out of the clean hole in your neck while your lungs collapse. It was like watching a chicken getting its head chopped off. His legs were frantic and squirming around andhis fists kept clenching at his throat and punching the planks of the floor.  

 

I've never seen a man die before. I've never seen someone grasp at anything in their final moments. I've never seen the blood ooze out of someone, dripping to the hardwood floor, streaming down the cracks between the planks. Slowly combining into a puddle of a deep red. His eyes eternally were facing the frame of the doorway. I didn't move an inch, Ididn't   

listen to anything Carly or Sarg said, I didn't even process what I just watched, I couldn't. Sarg grabbed me by the side of my vest, ""WHY THE HELL DID YOU OPEN THE DOOR!?""  I watched as Carly laid a blanket over the man's now lifeless corpse.  

""He was just scared,"" I finally whispered, my voice so distant it might've been coming from someone else.   

 

""Well, now he's dead because you didn’t take the most simple steps to be careful, you’ve been through training, and you did nothing to be couscous. We could’ve died because of your recklessness!"" Sarg growled. Carly ran between Me and Sarg to try to defend me. I got on my knees, I could feel the tears coating my eyes, and rolling down my face with no resistance. I tried to not look at him, what was left of him. I could still see the blood spreading toward me, as I looked through the doorway. The dark void filled the night sky, however, I could still see the elk in the night, now on all fours at the end of the parking lot. It slowly started walking back towards the tree line by the road, staring at me, as I was hyperventilating until I inevitably passed out..  

 

I woke up in the cafeteria of the hotel, lying on the bench of one of the long tables. I could feel the strain and dryness in my eyes, like I cried for hours straight. A thick wool blanket was wrapped around me, and a pillow from one of the couches was stiff under my head. Carly sat next to me, laying out a plate and a cup on the table, gesturing for me to sit up. She made bacon and oatmeal. It looked better than our usually shitty food, but I could already tell anything I willeat then was just going to be thrown back up hours later. Carly looked dead tired, but still concerned, that maternal instinct she tried so hard to hide showing through. ""How are you doing?"" I just looked down, not ignoring her question but just afraid to answer and remember what happened just hours ago. ""Sarg went out to pick up the guys...and I made coffee."" I quickly replied, ""Thank you.""  

Any movement I wanted to make felt impossible. Moving my arms up to grab my coffee was like boulders were tied to my wrist. I loosely grabbed the bacon and started taking nibbles at it, having no real appetite but anything to get me to not think about anything would be good for me. She hesitated to say her next sentence. ""Have you seen anything like that before...like, someone dying?"" Tears start forming in my eyes.  

 

""No...and It could've been prevented. I could have restrained him, hell, Sarg got him off of me. WHY THE HELL DID HE SHOOT HIM?""  

 

Tears were running down the sides of my face. My mind was going a thousand miles an hour, filled with anger and panic. Flashes of the images of last night were now going through my mind.  

 

""I could have fucking handled it! The man probably wasn't lying, there was probably something outside and he was just scared! He wasn't even armed.""  

I kept running my hands through my hair and grabbing it tight, tears were now making puddles on my plate drowningthe pieces of bacon.  

 

""What could've been out there Nick?! I think Sarg was just protecting you.""  

 

I didn't respond, I just sat there crying. Carly wrapped her arm around me trying to comfort me but I knew she was uncomfortable. About an hour went by, going back and forth crying and asking questions frantically that I knew were impossible to answer. The heat of the coffee was now gone, I could hear the birds outside and it felt like they were taunting me. Sarg, Lucas, and Caden came back and parked behind the back door of the cafeteria. Sarg went straight to the food, filling up his plate and Lucas started walking over to me, laying his hand on my back.   

 

""I heard someone got in a little catfight last night!""   

 

The silence in my response told him everything I was feeling. Lucas started walking towards the lobby down the hall of the cafeteria and embarrassment filled his voice.  

""I'm going to go grab your water okay?""   

 

I nodded as he walked away. I shouldn't have ever joined the National Guard. I've hunted before, mostly killing deer and pheasants. I didn't think about how different it is, seeing the body of a woodland creature, and a lifeless body of a man. Caden followed Lucas's trail, heading to the lobby. Sarg came over with a freshly brewed coffee, the smell of it was strong and made me feel sick. He sounded like a father trying to comfort his son.  

 

""Boy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for doing that right in front of you, and I'm sorry this is hitting you so hard.""  

 

He looked up from his coffee and was staring right into my eyes with a stern demeanor.  

""But this is our job and duty, we don't have a choice, Nick. You're a good kid but you got to keep it together."" Lucas and Caden came back into the cafeteria out of breath  

 

“Hey, guys? "" We all glanced in their direction as both of them simultaneously asked the same question.   

 

""Where's the body?""   

 

The question echoed in my mind, filled with different possibilities. We all followed Lucas and Caden, and once I saw Carly’s shock on her face, I couldn’t even begin to rationalize what happened. All that was there in the lobby was the bloody blanket and the dark red puddle that stained the wood floor.  

 

The corpse was gone—not a single trace remaining except for the blood. No drag marks, no blood prints, or trails. No evidence that He moved at all, and a new type of terror swarmed my mind.  

 

I want to finish the story, or at least what I can for now. But my hotspot from my phone keeps turning off and I don't know when or if it will stop working so I'm uploading what I have right now. If you are reading this, do me a favor and let people know I'm still here. This shit hole hasn't claimed me yet. Cooper, Malachi, if you're reading this I promise I'll be home soon. That is if you guys haven't burned it down lol... I love you two.  

 

* Until I can write more, Nick Ryder.

I’ve never been in a relationship before, but I’m finally at a point in life where I’m ready to change that. I’m looking for something real someone who’s honest, caring, and not afraid of a little distance while we figure things out together. Long distance doesn’t scare me if the connection is strong.

In my downtime, I’m all about movies (from action-packed thrillers to laid-back comedies), gaming, and fueling my day with way too much coffee. Seriously, coffee might be my love language.

I play mostly on Xbox and PC  I’m into games like Fortnite, Overwatch, Dead Rising, and a mix of co-op and story-driven stuff. Gaming’s been a huge part of my life for fun, escape, and even a little therapy.

I may still be trying to figure out exactly where I fit in this crazy world, but I know I’d love to find someone to share the journey with  whether that's chilling over video calls, playing a few rounds together, or dreaming about future adventures side by side.

Spreadsheet link above that***. Ran the lineup through ChatGPT+, so these genres might not all be accurate. Consider this a starting point for discovery and not definitive. Daily chart will come with the daily lineup posted per stage.

**Why?** Im all for following your ears and energy levels to whatever sound you find, AND also, when time and energy budgeting becomes more precarious especially come day 4 (Saturday - climax night) or 5, it might be worth noting which artists youd FOR SURE want to catch even if you have to drag your chair and have dinner there and grow roots for the night.. so to that end, I made this list. This is my 11th LIB and over time Ive just lost the energy/capacity to research lineups like I used to... but I figured, since I have ChatGPT+ might as well use it for some fun and speculation

**Disclaimer on inaccuracies:** LIB artists are known to bend outside their 'usual' genres or Coachella/EDC mainstage crowd genres, so consider this more a ""line of best fit"" or guestimated list versus ""100% actual reality"". AND LIB tends to book ppl that dont cleanly fit within their genre (maybe besides dubstep, riddim etc but even then they'll mix techno, dance, downtempo, etc), so consider these genre labels to be more ballpark than bullseye. Ive heard DJs often use LIB as the ""testing grounds"" for newer, experimental sets - making LIBs sets bellwethers for the rest of the year, or the launchpad for up-and-comer's full step onto the world or national stage.   
  
A few multi-genre examples that make for inaccurate chart reads:

* Tinzo + Jojo are house/dance music types, but are real crate diggers - jungle, breakbeat, euro dance, old school rave, disco -- whatever genre of house/dance they find -- just great music -- so ChatGPT wouldn't be able to define them within just a few words that would fit on a tight table.
* Four Tet long sets hit bass, UK, house, glitch, though his productiosn are often deep, emotive, minimal.
* Kiasmos ranges from minimal, ambient, electronica but sets can be emotive, hypnotic, techno influenced.
* Azzecca is tech house but plays acid, etc.
* We start splitting hairs at some point between Sultan + Shep and Tinlicker and Eli & Fur -- all distinct and different in their specific production styles, but you'd hear all of their tunes in a set from Hernan, for example (not at this LIB sadly). *Theres plenty of other distinctions Im sure but Im mostly a house/techno guy so I can only speak to those examples.*

I would run Junkyard + Stacks but many/all are locals, burner soundcamp folk, or otherwise so underground that ChatGPT wouldnt be a reliable source of info. There are some standouts at each, but maybe Ill run them with the daily lineups.

[Spreadsheet here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C3Tj8seoJQa7YrP3Eid9EkJH2d38-yp5tKNnszOId4Q/edit?usp=sharing). I enabled comment access because Im sure theres corrections needed so we can all share notes. The table is sortable/filterable.

1kavoaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1kavoaz/positive_psychiatrist_visit/,Positive Psychiatrist Visit!,"Okay, so now that I am working on learning how to accept my neuro developmental condition - for those who think it is neurodegenerative that only applies if it goes untreated, continuous substance abuse, etc. 

So, accepting that I do have a disability and it is quite a unique one that a lot of artist have suffered from yet created their greatest works of art 🖼️ living with it, I feel like I am a part of a group of highly resilient & creatively intelligent individuals. 

I still have med trauma of AP’s but here is what my new med regiment and emergency plan looks like for those who want to be conservative with meds specifically.

MED REGIMEN | BIPOLAR 1 W/PSYCHOSIS VET with 3 Major Episodes that Required Hospitalization:

Increasing Lamitrogine (Mood Stabilizer) from 200mg to 300mg

Staying temporarily on Latuda 20mg (Antipsychotic) which will eventually be discontinued. 

New Added Med I am Excited About - Wellbutrin (Antidepressant) I think it was for 150mg (Is that high?) - Also what are people’s experience with this pill? 💊 I’ve never been on it. 

Seroquel 25-100mg as needed for its sedative effects to sleep and stabilize ruminating thoughts which evens me out the next day. I might need a cup of coffee for the grogginess at higher levels but that is about it. 

Clonazepam 0.5 as needed (We are attempting to replace this with Wellbutrin to reduce addiction/withdrawal effects) if Wellbutrin doesn’t work for the anxiety part we will switch to Lexapro as an antidepressant as it helps with both depression + anxiety yet takes a little longer to work. 

EMERGENCY PLAN - Since I Plan to Discontinue a daily AP out of conservatism with AP’s due to longterm side effects and use them as needed.

I’m prescribed a bottle of Seroquel of 100mg to use 3x a day to reduce mania symptoms.

Know your triggers & pre-episode symptoms & inform your INNER CIRCLE on what they look like: for me they were

-  substance abuse of prescription weed & abusing the amount of coffee I drank.

- a super abusive partner that I am currently releasing out of my life which has been very difficult but is a necessity to move towards the next chapter in my life. 

- balance of work/stress life | I need a job where I can work no more than about 30 hours a week if I am handling other stressors in my life. I know that may not be realistic depending on the career choice. If that is the case and you have to work your 30 hours truly simplify your life & consider part time disability to assist if necessary. 

Inform Emergency Contact - mom & stepdad, aunts, grandma, cousins, partner, or trusted friend. 

Immediately inform my Psychiatrist’s assistant for an emergency apt. If not available have a second psychiatrist as a back up or go immediately into an outpatient care center to avoid involuntary hospitalization. They will add an adjunct antipsychotic like Latuda anywhere from 60-80mg. 

Hand over credit cards & cell phone communication 

Basically go into a secret agent black out mode and allow for the delusions to fade away with the treatment and coping mechanisms taught. 

*If anyone has any add ons to this please feel free to share.

DURING STABILITY ADD ON’s that Go a Long Way:

Med Compliance, CBT & Family Therapy, & Support Groups 

 A holistic lifestyle that includes daily supplements, herbs, & non hallucinogenic mushrooms like reishi & lionsmane. (The goal is not to need the antidepressant and find this in more holistic options, tinctures, sea moss, etc) 

FITNESS - I want to have the body I dreamed of and not blame meds because they should be able to help me push through to get there.

Affirmations, Gratitude, & Meditation

Not giving up on what you love 

Grounding - hug tress & walk barefoot on the grass

WHOLEFOOD Superfood Diet - we’re talking local farmers market stuff, raw macadamias, plant based keto diet choices. I was able to go 7 years med free on this but am sticking to Lamictal since it has happened to me 3 times in a decade. Don’t want to think the cartel is after me again 😅

Finding the right, loving, and loyal partner. ❤️‍🩹

&

Beyond several inconveniences, I will report only what I consider most basic, especially for a European:

Official Currency Onboard: USD is the official currency onboard. If the European market is the target, having only one currency onboard is scandalous. It is not even possible to exchange money onboard.

Lack of Smoking Area: There is no designated smoking area. They do not advertise that smokers can only smoke in a limited space of about 4m² on the deck, exposed to the elements, or leaning against a slot machine while gambling. Do I have to gamble if I want to smoke?

Coffee Options: Only Starbucks?

Lack of Late Buffet: There is no late buffet option.

Small Pool/Tank: The pool is very small.

US-Adapted Gastronomy: The food is adapted to US tastes and lacks variety. You have to wait endlessly for meals. They advertised a Merlot on the menu that was never available.

Dinner Reservations: You need reservations for dinner if you are in a large group; otherwise, even with a free table, there are lots of people waiting for a table. The shows are too early; you either eat or watch the shows.

Imagine the lights next to the bed being placed right next to your head. The TV is wedged in a corner where it's impossible to see it, even though there is available space on the opposite wall. I went three days without shaving because the technicians didn't understand that it had nothing to do with me trying to plug a phone into the bathroom outlet. I was complaining that the outlet wasn't working, and they kept saying I couldn't plug the phone in. I had to get really upset due to so much incompetence to finally get the electrical outlet repaired.

1kavknr,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1kavknr/help_me_understand_him_and_his_actions/,Help me understand him and his actions,"1. Met on reddit. He was an INTJ, 29. Im INFJ, 29. We hit it off immediately. Talked for hours and hours on chat, for at least a month. Anything under the sun we could make a conversation about. Our childhoods, MBTI, anime, being neurodivergent. We understood each other so well, our idiosyncrasies that others find confusing, we find a fellow friend in. Our heartaches with his failed engagement and my recent breakup. He promises to loan me a book he thinks I would like.

2. He asks me out for a movie we both procrastinated on seeing out, I agree, breaking my 2 month rule for him because I was so excited in being seen and understood on such a level. The book he promised is given to me.

3. Met for the movie, it was a little awkward at first since we couldn't speak during the movie. He is more quiet, but I keep the chatter going hoping to ease tension. Stares at me a lot in a way I find a little uneasy. He made a joke about how both of us were wearing denim jackets and it broke the ice. Went for coffee after the movie and chatted somemore. Later turned to dinner. He paid, and I asked him how much I owed him and wired him the amount.

4. Streams his favourite show for me till late in the night. Gives me the backstory, the lore, behind the scenes stuff. I ask questions, crack silly jokes and he responds well to them

5. I ask him out for dinner after work about a week later. He happily agrees. Even offers to pick me up at my office but I decided to play it safe and tell him ill meet him at the restaurant. We eat, he seems subdued. Stares at me kind of like a trance like state but doesn't talk as much. I keep catching him staring. He also looks tired and sleep deprived so I leave it as that as he does have a habit of late night gaming.

6. Walks me to the train station and rushes off to catch his own train without a goodbye. I text him to let me know my portion of the bill. He sends it and I wire.

6. Conversations begin to die down. He says he's busy with work. Doesn't bother me as much as I get swamped too. 

7. I begin to notice that he's no longer as responsive. Messages are flat and cordial. He goes on a trip and communication all but fizzles out except when I request for a pic of the scenery (he promised this in earlier conversation) and he sends one without preamble. I ask him how the trip is going: ""It's alright.""

8. I decide to let it go. I text him to let me know when he's back from the trip and I'll arrange a messenger delivery for his book back. He agrees. Doesn't text me for about 2 weeks. Well past the supposed date of his return.

9. I get over him and have essentially emotionally detached from him.

10. Out of nowhere enthusiastically begins texting me again. I curtly remind him for his address to send his book back. He obliges and asks how I find it, I just respond ""It's alright.""

Zero communication since then.

I'm still puzzled at what happened, why it's happened and just... how?

1kavh9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rToronto_Clean/comments/1kavh9c/m4f_seeking_a_discreet_adventure/,M4F - Seeking a discreet adventure,"I’m a 35-year-old guy, married but craving a connection that’s been missing for a while. Life’s been a predictable routine—work, errands, Netflix binges—and I’m ready to add a little thrill to it. I’m looking for someone who’s in a similar spot, maybe craving a discreet escape where we can be ourselves, no strings, just vibes.

A bit about me: I’m 5’7, slight dad bod and I’ve been told I’m easy on the eyes. I’m a sucker for deep conversations, witty banter, and those stolen glances that make your heart race. I work in tech and finance, so I’m good at keeping things low-key and respectful. Bonus points if you love coffee shop meetups, late-night chats, or have a secret talent I’d never guess.

What I’m hoping for: A partner-in-crime who’s curious, kind, and maybe a little daring. Age isn’t a dealbreaker, but chemistry is everything. 

DM me if you’re intrigued, and let’s see if we can write a story worth keeping secret. Discretion is a must, and I promise to bring the charm!

I have had him for a little under a month now but did not want to post until I knew he would be staying with me (insurance kerfuffle). He's a TiLite Aero T, and I have an Empulse R90 attachment too. It's been incredible. I can't overstate how mind-blowing it is to decide you want to go out for a cup of coffee or a stroll around the neighborhood and then *be able to* without having it planned out days beforehand. It's even more of a revelation than when I got my shitty K0004. It sounds silly now, but I didn't truly realize just how energy-limiting an energy-limiting chronic illness can be. I have the most freedom I've had in years and I am very grateful.

That said, I have been having some issues with caster flutter. At first, it would only start on rougher sidewalks or when going about 5mph, but now it's starting at only 3 or so, and on much smoother terrain, which worries me. I also hear a clicking noise coming from the casters, especially when it rotates. Both issues are worst in my right caster. I'm not sure what is up with them, and as my chair is so very new, I'm concerned about reliability. I have had a few incidents where a pothole has launched me face-first into the asphalt, with my chair landing on top of me.

* **2:30 PM:** **Bus to Alpe di Siusi (Seiser Alm):** Take a local bus from Chiusa (line 170 or 179, check the Südtirol Mobil schedule). The bus will take you up to the Alpe di Siusi plateau.
* **3:30 PM - 5:30 PM:** **Explore Alpe di Siusi:**
   * Enjoy easy walks on the vast alpine meadows. The views of the Sassolungo, Sassopiatto, and Sciliar mountains
   * Consider a short, scenic cable car or chairlift ride within Alpe di Siusi to access different viewpoints (e.g., the Panorama chairlift).
   * Relax at a mountain hut and enjoy a drink or snack with the stunning backdrop.
* **6:00 PM:** **Bus back to Chiusa:** Take the bus from Alpe di Siusi back down to Chiusa.
* **7:00 PM:** Dinner in Chiusa.

12th June:

* **8:00 AM:** **Bus to Ortisei:** Take a local bus from Chiusa to Ortisei. Check the Südtirol Mobil schedule.
* **9:00 AM:** **Seceda Cable Car:** From Ortisei, take the Ortisei-Furnes gondola, followed by the Furnes-Seceda cable car to reach Seceda. Enjoy the views.

* **11:00 AM:** **Descend to Ortisei:** Take the cable cars back down to Ortisei.
* **11:30 AM:** **Bus to Karersee (Lake Carezza):** From the Ortisei bus station, take **bus line 180** towards Bolzano. This bus stops directly at Lago di Carezza (Karersee). The journey takes approximately 45-60 minutes and offers scenic views.
* **12:30 PM - 2:30 PM:** **Explore Lago di Carezza:** Admire the stunning emerald lake and the reflections of the Latemar and Rosengarten mountains. Take a leisurely walk around the lake (it's an easy, mostly flat path that takes about 30-40 minutes). Enjoy the magical atmosphere and take photos. You might want to have a light snack here.
* **2:30 PM:** **Bus back to Ortisei:** Take bus line 180 from Lago di Carezza back to Ortisei.
* **3:30 PM - 5:00 PM:** **Explore Ortisei:** Wander through the charming pedestrian center, browse shops, and enjoy a coffee or gelato.
* **5:00 PM:** **Bus back to Chiusa:** Take a local bus from Ortisei back to Chiusa.
* **6:00 PM:** Dinner in Chiusa.

So,in this itinerary that was prepared,I feel it has too much travel timing and thus I want to choose one out of Val di Funes and Lago di Carezza/Karersee.

Visiting an alpine lake is on my bucket lists and as Lago di Braies is far away with public transport, this is the only mountain lake visit in reach.

On the other hand being an amateur photographer myself and seeing those beautiful sunset shots of Santa Maddalena church is also tempting.

My older kids are 10 and 12. I used to fight them all weekend to do their chores. Simple things like unloading the dishwasher, putting away their clean clothes, or taking care of their animals , took hours with arguments, threats, and constant consequences.  The two days a week where we could spend all day together…and we fought the whole time. I felt our relationship was suffering. 

I wanted something that would motivate my kids to complete their chores, and reward them with screen time. I wanted it to be their decision to do their chores, not me having to be the bad guy all the time. 

Then I found it, the perfect app. 

ScreenCoach allows you to do just that. You can customize it to work for your family, creating chores and assigning the worth. It monitors their screen time and when it’s up, all their apps block and they have to do more chores to get more! Best thing Is… it works across devices so it can be installed on my kids phones, and their computer and it works together! 

Plus, it has a “bonus” feature so the kids can increase their screen time even more for things like “done without being asked” or “done with a good attitude”.  The bane of my daughter’s existence is cleaning her guinea pig cage. It used to take her hours of whining and stalling…but now it’s done before my morning coffee is gone.

Still no baby yet, but thought I'd share something that doctors don't tell you or know about because studies contradict it: After doing all the labs and tests multiple times, a shrugging Urologist, at the risk of losing my job, I ended my prescribed Adderall, and immediately went from 2M or less to more than 15m consistently.  

Sadly, my wife is now turning 40 and in declining fertility and burnt out by the whole process. We had 2 failed IVF transfers and 3 failed IUIs. 

39 years old. Non-smoker, causal beer drinker, coffee-drinker, office worker, commuter, exercise 3x week. 

Supplements I take:   COQ10, Mens Fertility supplement, vitamin C, Omega-3, liquid turmeric. 

Recently Motility has been consistently zero and that is final impediment to healthy sperm capable of conception. Over the years it has fluctuated with no doctor able to point to which lifestyle changes affected it. Cutting all alcohol has seemed to have some positive correlation but not clear.  I have done 3 separate 3-month sober stints over the past 3 years.  I will do another now, having solved count, hopefully to boost motility. 

New supplements for motility:  L-Arginine, Carnitine.  Been taking for 2 weeks. Sadly, I used to take these early on but stopped because COUNT factor remain unchanged (due to unknown Adderall cause).  I will update in 90- days. 

  
If you're a man struggling with infertility or a man's partner fighting with him, just know there's people like me and my wife who have gone through devastating sad times pushing us close to divorce. Its a Shi\*\*y effing journey. While procreating is an epic adventure, and a dream for many (either visceral or indoctrinated by movies and family culture), try to remember there's much more to your life than making your own babies. If you truly want  to add to your family and raise a human, there's other options.

The machine’s compact size and vibrant Dusty Rose color have certainly elevated not just my countertop aesthetics but also my coffee-drinking ritual. 

**Design and Portability**  
What strikes you the moment you unbox this coffee maker is its astonishingly slim design. Measuring less than five inches wide, this machine tucks neatly into any cozy corner of your kitchen. I’ve seen it fit comfortably not only on crowded countertops but also in my office break room. Thanks to its built-in cord storage, the machine travels well—it didn’t create any tangled frustrations when I shifted it between rooms during a family gathering. The Dusty Rose matte finish is a showstopper, and everyone in the family, kids included, couldn’t stop commenting on its chic look.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting up and brewing couldn't be more straightforward. The Keurig K-Mini doesn’t overwhelm you with complicated buttons or options. You add fresh water for each brew, insert a K-Cup pod, hit the single button, and voilà—coffee is on its way. The simplicity of this setup is a godsend for my elderly parents, who usually struggle with overly complex gadgets. Although automated, it retains just enough manual input to make you feel engaged.

**Performance**  
This little machine performs faster than expected. Within minutes, the coffee is brewed to a perfect temperature. We tested everything from simple black coffee to flavored pods, and the flavor consistency was impressive across the board. The reservoir supports one cup at a time, which makes water freshness optimal but may feel repetitive if you're brewing multiple cups consecutively. Luckily, the single-cup design avoids leftover water lingering around—a germ-avoidant win in my book.

**Positives**  
- Compact and travel-friendly design.  
- Effortlessly brews between 6-12 ounces to accommodate different mug sizes.  
- Auto-off feature conserves energy by turning the machine off 90 seconds after the last brew.  
- Reusable filter compatibility supports eco-conscious coffee-making habits.  

[Find the best price for Keurig K-Mini on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08323nvl1/)

**Taste and Quality**  
The quality of the coffee produced is where this machine shines brightest. Being picky about bitterness, I was thrilled that every cup brewed was smooth and rich. Whether you are using regular K-Cups or the reusable coffee filter, the results are reliable. My spouse even used it to brew tea from specially designed pods, and the taste was just as pleasing.

**User Limitations**  
While I enjoyed using this machine daily, it isn’t without its quirks. Its silent brewing process left a few guests confused—they assumed it wasn’t working when all they needed was patience. Additionally, the lack of a low-water indicator caught me off guard a couple of times. On two occasions, overpouring caused water to spill out onto the counter—a minor hassle. Parents of impatient teens should note the lack of multi-cup brewing, as this machine is not built for high-volume coffee demands during family breakfasts.

**Shortcomings**  
- Lack of a water-level indicator makes overfilling easy for first-timers.  
- Single-cup reservoir might feel limiting for gatherings or larger households.  
- Absence of noise cues can be confusing.  

**Competing Brands**  
Having tried several alternatives like the Nespresso Essenza Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I can say this Keurig product holds its ground. The Essenza Mini boasts ultra-smooth espresso shots but doesn’t offer the broad beverage variety the K-Mini does. Meanwhile, the FlexBrew’s two-way brewing gets points for versatility, but its larger size falls short in compactness. For anyone looking to prioritize portability and modern aesthetics, this Keurig model outshines its peers.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Is it worth the investment? Absolutely. While not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, this model’s premium build, taste quality, and energy efficiency easily justify its price. Over the past month, I’ve even noticed fewer trips to expensive coffee shops—a cost-efficiency win for my wallet.

I just realised that I do feel sad being alone. I went on a holiday and i met this guy, a straight guy. I am a bi male. We met by chance somewhere in europe, he was travelling from asia. He was staying in another hotel. I spotted him on a busy square and approached him first to ask if he could take my photo. I usually do this as i often travel on my own. We started chatting and to make long story short, we hit it off and we would always meet everyday for coffee, photo ops, breakfast, lunch, dinner for about several days. 

I enjoyed his company so much that when i was about to decide where to go next and he suggested i go with him to his next destination in europe, i agreed quickly. We agreed to stay in same hotel room. I knew it was a mistake! But i couldn’t resist. 

That was the most wonderful week i ever had in my life. Writing this now, i can’t help but cry that it ended. We did everything together, going here and there,  every meal, every photos. And yes, we had sex. He had a gf back home but the sexual tension in the room was too much for him that he caved in. Maybe i was too flirty lol.

Now, i am back home and i look at all the photos/videos we took, i feel sad that i dont see him anymore in person. 

I miss every morning when i will tease him, we smile, talk, go for breakfast  and of course, being intimate. 

We had a few disagreements on silly things but looking back, it’s kind of why i miss him. We just met and we were already having disagreements and we make up afterwards. I will say it now, i fell in love with him.

It’s less than a week since we parted ways and we text each other. The point of this post is that it’s such a wonderful feeling to share your life, even for just a few days, with someone else. 

I keep reminiscing our days together, i look at the photos and videos we took, and i feel happy and sad at the same time. The saddest part is that I maybe the only one feeling this cos now he’s back with his gf. Every time i get a text from him, i feel happy and feel better.

1kauu95,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kauu95/a_new_relationship_chapter_1/,A new relationship - Chapter 1,"The Christmas market had been Olivia’s idea. After weeks of hesitant online messages, she had finally decided: *this* would be their first meeting. Not a casual coffee, not a hesitant walk in the park—no, something magical. Twinkling lights, the scent of mulled wine, the crunch of snow underfoot. Perfect.

Thomas had agreed immediately, though he’d had plans with friends that evening. *No matter*, he’d told himself. *I’ll make it work.*

When he pulled up to the bus stop where she’d asked him to pick her up, his breath caught. There she stood—tall, blonde, her cheeks pink from the cold, a soft smile playing on her lips. She looked even lovelier than in her pictures. Heart pounding, he rolled down the window.

""Hey, you must be Olivia?""

She tilted her head slightly, studying him for a moment before nodding. But she didn’t move toward the car.

Confused, Thomas hesitated. Was something wrong? Had he misunderstood the meeting spot? He unbuckled his seatbelt and stepped out, the cold air biting at his skin.

""Everything okay?"" he asked, closing the distance between them.

Olivia’s smile remained polite, but there was something deliberate in her gaze. When he leaned in instinctively for a greeting kiss, she turned her head slightly, offering her cheek instead.

""Ah,"" he murmured, brushing a light kiss there before pulling back, slightly flustered.

Then, with a small but firm laugh, she said, ""I was waiting for you to open the door for me.""

*Oh.*

Thomas blinked, then quickly moved to the passenger side, pulling the door open with an awkward chuckle. ""Right. Sorry about that.""

Olivia slid into the seat gracefully, adjusting her coat before looking up at him. ""No need to apologize. Just something to remember for next time.""

There was a beat of silence as he circled back to the driver’s side, his mind racing. *Next time.* She’d already assumed there would be one.

The moment the car started moving, Olivia filled the silence effortlessly.

""You know, I’ve been to this market before, but never with someone else. It’s nicer when you share it, don’t you think?"" She didn’t wait for an answer. ""Oh! And you have to try the food there—the best in the region. My ex never liked them, but I think he just had bad taste in general.""

Thomas chuckled, stealing glances at her as she spoke. Her voice was warm, animated, her hands gesturing as she recounted stories—her job, her family, her love of winter. He barely had to say a word; she carried the conversation like a river, smooth and unstoppable.

Then, a familiar holiday tune played on the radio. Olivia’s eyes lit up.

""Oh, I *love* this one!"" She reached over, turning up the volume, and began singing along, her voice light and surprisingly melodic. Thomas grinned, tapping his fingers on the wheel, content to listen.

When the song ended, she sighed happily, then immediately launched into another story—this time about a childhood memory involving a snowman and a mischievous dog. The drive passed in what felt like seconds, the car filled with her laughter, her voice, her presence.

And despite the slight strangeness of their first moments, Thomas couldn’t help but think: *She’s incredible.*

But he also wondered, just briefly, if he’d ever get a chance to speak.

Thomas parked the car at the edge of the city, where the rates were cheaper. The winter air was crisp, and the distant glow of the Christmas market lights flickered through the bare trees. He turned off the engine, glancing at Olivia with a satisfied smile.

""Here we are. Just a short walk to the market.""

Olivia tilted her head, her gloved hands resting neatly in her lap. ""What do you mean, *a short walk*?""

Thomas blinked. ""Well, the parking here is half the price of the ones closer to—""

She cut him off with a soft laugh, shaking her head. ""Oh, no no no. I know a better spot. Right next to the market.""

Before he could protest, she was already tapping the new location into his phone’s GPS. Thomas hesitated, then followed the directions—only to wince as they pulled into the premium parking area, the fee displayed in bold numbers.

*That’s almost triple what I’d have paid…*

But Olivia was already unbuckling her seatbelt, her eyes bright with anticipation. Swallowing his reluctance, he paid and parked.

As soon as the car stopped, Thomas stepped out, stretching his legs after the drive. Then he paused—Olivia hadn’t moved. She sat perfectly still, her gaze expectant.

A beat passed before it clicked.

*Right. The door.*

He hurried around the car, pulling it open with an apologetic smile. ""Sorry, I’ll… try to remember next time.""

Olivia stepped out, adjusting her scarf before patting his cheek lightly. ""I know you will. You’ll learn quickly, I’m sure.""

And with that, she took the lead, weaving through the snow-dusted streets toward the market, Thomas falling into step beside her. The air smelled of cinnamon and roasted chestnuts, and the sound of carols mingled with laughter. Olivia guided them effortlessly, pointing out stalls she liked, deciding which mulled wine stand had the best spices, which wooden ornaments were ""authentic enough."" Thomas listened, mesmerized by the way her cheeks flushed in the cold, the way her laughter rose like music above the crowd.

Then she stopped abruptly in front of a churros stand, the golden dough spiraling into hot oil.

""Do you like these?"" she asked, though her tone suggested the answer didn’t matter.

Thomas shrugged. ""Eh, not really. A bit too sugary for—""

""One portion, please!"" she called to the vendor, already digging in her purse. Thomas reached for his wallet, but she waved him off—only to hand him the receipt afterward with a sweet smile.

*Ah. So I’m paying.*

He did so without complaint, watching as she took the first bite, powdered sugar dusting her lips.

""Mmm—oh, these are terrible!"" She frowned, holding the churro at arm’s length. ""They’re already cold. Here, try.""

Before he could refuse, she pressed a piece into his mouth. Thomas chewed dutifully.

""Yeah, not great,"" he admitted.

""Exactly!"" Olivia sighed, as if he’d confirmed her deepest suspicions. Then she handed him the rest. ""Here, finish them.""
