Big crowds drain me fast, small talk feels exhausting, but I light up in one-on-one convos with someone who gets it. If you're the type who prefers cozy nights in, deep late-night talks about random thoughts/life dreams/movies/books, or just comfortable silence while we both do our own thing in the same space  hi, let's chat.

A bit about me: 5'6"", curvy build, brunette, pretty low-maintenance vibe (jeans and hoodies are my uniform). I love reading fantasy/sci-fi, binge-watching shows (currently into slow-burn series or comfort rewatches), gaming (cozy/indie stuff mostly, but open to multiplayer if it's chill), long walks with podcasts or music, coffee shop hangs (but quiet ones), and occasionally baking when the mood hits. I'm thoughtful, a good listener, sarcastic in a gentle way, and I value honesty over games. Not super outgoing, but once I feel safe/comfortable, I open up a ton  I crave real emotional connection over superficial stuff.

What I'm looking for: Someone 22-32ish (age flexible), preferably guy but open-minded, who understands introvert energy. Doesn't have to be identical interests  just mutual respect for needing recharge time, no pressure to be ""on"" all the time. Online-first is perfect (texting/Discord/voice calls), and if it clicks, maybe meet IRL someday for low-key dates like coffee, movie nights, or drives with no agenda. I'm open to friendship that could turn romantic, or straight-up dating if vibes align. Bonus if you're into meaningful convos, sharing memes at 2am, or just being each other's safe space.

Not into: Party scenes, constant texting marathons (I reply when I have energy), ghosting, or pushy vibes. Be patient introverts move slow, but when we're in, we're loyal and caring.

If this resonates, drop a comment or DM with a little about you: age/location, what makes you introverted, fave way to unwind, or why you're here. No pressure for pics right away  let's start with words and see if we click. Who's out there feeling the same quiet longing for someone who just *gets* it? 😊🌌

But if we look beyond speculation, the core [blockchain technology ](https://www.blockchain-council.org/)itself has some genuinely useful real-world applications that deserve more attention.

For example, blockchain can improve supply chain transparency. Imagine scanning a QR code on a coffee bag and instantly seeing its entire journey from a specific farm to the store shelf, with data that cannot be altered.

In healthcare, blockchain could give individuals ownership of their medical records. Instead of repeating paperwork at every hospital, patients could securely share their data with doctors whenever needed, regardless of the healthcare system.

Real estate is another promising area. Blockchain-powered smart contracts could automate property transfers, reduce paperwork, remove multiple intermediaries, and lower transaction costs when buying or selling a home.

So the question remains: are we overlooking blockchain’s real utility because the crypto conversation is so dominant? Many believe the technology still holds strong potential beyond finance, while others see it as overhyped. What do you think?",2,1771589923.0,BlockchainStartups,2,1.0,False

(Posting here for the legal perspective),"I'm a bangalorean and I'm in a long-distance relationship with a girl who is a Christian, and I'm a Hindu (28F & 29M). My parents are dead against us being together and getting married. We are at the stage in life where we want to get married. My mom called 2 people home from Akhila Karnataka Brahmana Mahasabha, with the goal of making me break up with her. She told me that they told her they can’t do that, but they’ll tell me all the implications of an intercaste/inter-religion marriage. They came home last Sunday, introduced themselves, and did not mention “Akhila Karnataka Brahmana Mahasabha” even once. They did mention where they’re from, though, and it was another name… It was RSS.

They told me Hindustan is “Hindu ka sthan” - the place for Hindus. They said the nation comes first. Apart from this propaganda BS, they were nice. They simply spoke about stuff… I guess…and in about 20 minutes after having coffee, they left.

I have been unable to sleep for the following week. I feel tortured. My mom constantly asks me why I don’t break up. Telling me bullshit about how it can never work between my girlfriend and me. I’m on edge all the time and unable to focus on anything. It’s so exhausting. It’s TORTURE. In the full sense of the word. Most important of all… My girlfriend is FRIGHTENED… She’s questioning whether it’s worth it to be with me. And I can’t possibly blame her. She’s so right. This is a line that no parent in their right mind should ever cross. I feel my girlfriend's life, her work, her family, her everything has been endangered by this. In both our opinions, actually. And I feel horrible about myself. She didn’t sign up for this. Nobody does. Her safety is my responsibility, and no matter how seemingly harmless this particular interaction might have been, I know I have failed. I have no right to convince her to save the relationship with me right now. We are deeply in love, but that is not the priority right now. Even if she breaks up with me, I need to ensure her safety.

I have concluded that I have to bring the house down tonight. (A metaphor for having a talk with my parents, confronting them about how messed up this is, how deranged and drastic this step they took is, and how it’s a line that they can’t uncross.) There’s obviously almost 3 full years of abuse and history (specific to my relationship) that I have weathered till now in the hopes of convincing them in the end (and can’t cover in just this post), so that I can finally give my woman, in-laws that are supportive and loving and genuinely happy when they see how we get along and flourish together as a couple that cares for each other. I want to conclude, though, that they are too extreme for this to possibly pan out in the idealistic way that I’ve been picturing. I’m finding it hard to come to grips with the fact that we both have been resilient in this relationship despite my parents being against it, for absolutely nothing. But I know it needs to be done. The hammer needs to be dropped. I need to abandon my parents' home. And it needs to be done now.

  
I want your opinions on:

1. What are the immediate steps I need to take to ensure safety for my woman? (Legal action, steps I need to take, anything really. This is of utmost priority.)  
2. Are there specific things I need to say, or is there a specific (Most effective tactic available) way to bring said hammer down on my parents? (I’m new to talking to my parents in such a drastic black/white way. I know. I’m ashamed of it too.)  
3. Are there specific things I need to remember not to do during the confrontation? (I plan to voice record it as proof as well. Don’t know how or why it may come in handy later, but yeah.)  
4. How can I prevent my parents from coming to my workplace after I drop said hammer on them?",0,1771589685.0,LegalAdviceIndia,2,0.5,False

Handshake deals with vendors.  
Equity promises made over coffee.  
Employees treated like contractors without documentation.

1r9trwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r9trwm/eyes_eyes_eyes_eyes/,eyes eyes eyes EYES.,"CHAPTER  #010

Man, I was a very naive child back then.

Even though I was oddly hyperaware of time flying by as a younger kid, I don’t think I appreciated the good times enough while they lasted.

Taylor Krol and I are sophomores in high school now and it’s about as miserable as you’d expect. Being 16 years old makes me want to explode with boiling rage and curl up into a sobbing ball at the same time. Whenever I explain that to an adult, they sing the highest praises of their “golden days” in high school and all of their *shoo-wop shoo-wop* shenanigans, or whatever.

They’ll say things like *“enjoy it while it lasts!”*

***I*** say get me the hell out of here!

“You’re scowling again,” Taylor observes from across the rickety picnic table, poking my round cheek with the eraser of his pencil.

I flash him a smile that practically drips with sarcasm.

“Creepy,” He mutters with a disgusted expression.

“So are you coming over after school or not?” I ask, pulling my knees up to my chest and resting my arms on them. The California spring breeze still has the ghost of winter on its breath. It makes me shudder. Maybe we should’ve hung out inside for lunch after all.

“Can’t. I have my dumb-ass therapy today.” He prods at a green beetle trotting along the scratchy surface near his sketchbook with that same pencil.

“Still? I thought you told your grandma that you didn’t need it anymore.”

“Yeah, well, Mila doesn’t think so. She says there’s still a lot of work to be done. She told Grandma that it’s in my ‘best interest’ to continue working with me.”

“That’s dumb.”

“*Super* dumb.”

“Oh, I almost forgot,” I pause to pull out a clear container of homemade snickerdoodle cookies and set them down on his sketchbook, “these are for you.”

I take great pleasure in watching the way Taylor still lights up like a firework whenever this happens. Even after literal years of baking the same batch of cookies for him, he always reacts like it’s the first time.

“Fuck yeah, thanks,” Taylor says with that trademark boyish grin of his.

He shows me the piece he’s been working on for his art class in the short amount of time we have left. For the broad topic of “emotions” assigned by the teacher, he chose to depict happiness by sketching a book full of poppies with scarlet petals. They were his mother’s favorite flowers.

It’s breathtaking.

After the bell rings and we go our separate ways for the next period, I can’t help but recognize how proud I am of Taylor Krol. The fact that his therapist- that nauseatingly clinical Mila chick- still thinks he has work to be done makes me believe she has no idea what she’s talking about. She doesn’t know my best friend the way I do, but then again, I guess that’s the whole point.

Still… it’s been about six years since Taylor’s mom died and he’s doing much better than he was. I’ve seen it for myself over the years. However, the hardest hill for my best friend to haul himself over was never knowing the cause of her early death. Back then, his grandma didn’t ask for an autopsy. It took years for Taylor to accept that her death will forever remain an unsolved mystery.

Now that I’m older, I’ve thought about death a lot. In fact, I went on to think about it for the rest of the school day.

Even now as I step onto the bus, clap Marty the Bus Driver on the shoulder, and plop myself down into the usual window seat… I’m thinking about death.

If I really thought I was scared of death then, at nine years old? I truly knew nothing. Growing up with full internet access doesn’t make it any better.

I untangle my earbuds, put them in my ears, and plug the cord into my phone. Distraction. I *need* a distraction. Thinking about death fills me with the petrifying anxiety one might feel if they were having a staring contest with an incoming missile. It makes me sick.

I open Spotify as I chew on the inside of my cheek. The soft skin immediately gives, fueling my harmful habit. I scroll through my liked songs as Marty the Bus Driver pulls back onto the road and takes a long sip of his absurdly large coffee.

My thumb pauses on *Shangri-La* by Electric Light Orchestra. I’m about to tap on it for some extra comfort, but…

*No*, something in my brain tells me.

… I keep scrolling.

I need something upbeat. I’ve been frowning and brooding more than Donnie ever has in his life so far. I want whimsy.

I settle for *Baba O’Riley* by The Who and stare out the window until I’m home.

When I get off of the bus at the stop just outside my neighborhood, I can’t help but feel like I’m being watched. It’s uncomfortable. I turn toward the departing bus after only taking a few steps, but no one’s there. I watch until it’s gone, then turn back around.

“— Hello.”

“FUCK!” I yell into the face of some teenager; one who’s decided to startle me with his presence, I guess! I jump back a few feet and hold my hands up instinctively.

… I don’t recognize him, but he looks to be around my age. He has curly black hair that falls down to his shoulders and light brown skin. More importantly, his eyes are really… something. They’re the brightest green I’ve ever seen!

“… Um?” I question when he doesn’t move a muscle or say a single word. He just keeps staring.

“Oh. My name is Antonio,” the teen says with a blank expression.

“Okay?”

“… We’re kind of neighbors.”

“Since when?” I ask, crossing my arms. I’ve never seen this guy and his flash beam eyes in my life before.

“My family and I moved into this neighborhood a few weeks ago,” Antonio says.

“Can you stop, uh… y’know…” I wave my hands around vaguely, “staring at me like that? Can you smile? Even if it’s not a real smile, I think I’ll relax a bit more if you aren’t soulless.”

The dude hesitates before a slow smile curls up on his lips. It’s like something out of a horror movie. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up at attention.

“Fuck, never mind. Don’t ever do that again,” I say quickly, covering my eyes. When I finally drop my hands, he’s blank-faced again. “Do you go to Riverwood High?”

“I’m homeschooled. What’s your name?”

“June Robinson. Are you wearing contacts?”

“No, and my mom says my eyes are my best feature. How often do you go into the woods over there?”

I walk right past him with a groan and say, “alright, enough of the twenty questions game. I’m not letting you murder me in the woods. Nice try.”

Antonio follows me with his dumb and lifeless face.

“How about *out* of the woods?” He asks.

I stop in my tracks… slowly turn… and look at him in disbelief.

Those horrific eyes crinkle ever so slightly at the corners. His lips twitch.

“Only joking, of course,” Antonio says after a very generous pause of silence.

“Lucky me, my new neighbor is a comedian,” I say with heavy sarcasm.

This Antonio guy follows me all the way to my door. I turn around and wait for him to say something. Anything. He just keeps his eyes glued to me and gives me absolutely nothing emotion-wise. I lean forward and knock on his forehead as if it’s a door.

“Anyone in there? You should go back home now,” I say pointedly.

Another painfully slow blink from Antonio Thee Expressionless. Miraculously, he finally remembers that he exists and shoves his hands into the pockets of his ripped jeans.

“My mom makes really great empanadas,” is all he says. He then pivots in place and walks back the way he came.

I’ll have to double-check that all of the windows and doors are locked tonight. I make my way into the house, still reeling from… well, whatever the fuck just happened.

“That you, Donnie?” I hear Dad call from the living room.

“Yep, it’s me,” I lie blatantly as I kick my shoes off. I don’t even bother to change my voice.

“Ope- hey, Junebug. Do me a favor and bring me a can?” Dad asks, leaning over the side of his recliner to wave at me with a smile.

“This early?” I mumble quietly since he’s not meant to hear it. I still grab him a tall, chilled can from the fridge door on my way into the house. i pop it open and set it down on the side table beside him. The sound of fizzing briefly fills the air.

“Thanks, kiddo. How was school?” Dad asks, his eyes on me as he takes a hearty swig.

“Fine. The usual. Nothing to write home about.” I hunker down on the couch beside where I dropped my backpack to the ground. “We have some new neighbors two streets over, by the way.”

“Been a while since someone’s moved into the neighborhood,” Dad comments. He taps his fingers rhythmically on the side of the silver can.

“Hey, why aren’t you watching TV?” I ask, glancing over at his pride and joy- AKA the big flatscreen TV he saved up for.

Dad’s quick to wave it off.

“I got a business call from work, so I turned it off before I answered the phone. Damn thing ended up takin’ a lot longer than I wanted it to. Just got off of it before ya walked in, actually. Haven’t turned it back on since.”

“Huh. Is Donnie home?” I ask, my eyes lifting to the ceiling. I don’t hear his usual loud chattering on the phone.

“Nope. He ran to Home Depot for some more boxes,” Dad replies, picking up the TV remote and turning it on. The screen comes to life and the pixels dance around to display a college hockey game. The very same college and sport that Donnie will be playing for in just a few months after he moves out.

We’re both quiet after that.

“I’m gonna miss him,” I mumble when a commercial interrupts the program to advertise a horror movie about an abandoned mine shaft in the mountains.

“You an’ me both.” Dad takes the last sip of the can and crunches it in his fist. “Wanna grab me another?”

“No. You shouldn’t have another,” I chide him gently.

Sometimes Dad gets intense and defensive when I try to stop him from drinking too much. This isn’t one of those times. His face displays guilt before he nods- as if to say “touché”- and drops it.

There’s a knock at the door before I can even think about what I want to say next.

Dad looks at me with raised eyebrows and asks, “Taylor Krol?”

I shake my head and reply, “He’s got therapy. You order some pizza?”

“I wish!” Dad barks out a laugh.

I stand up before he can and make my way to the front door, leaning on my tip-toes to look through the peephole. I open it immediately after seeing a flash of orange.

“Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and-“

“Why aren’t you in therapy?” I ask none other than Taylor Krol.

“Mila had a family emergency and cancelled, so I decided to skate over here since I was nearby. Hey, there’s this weird kid outside on your lawn, by the way,” He says, stepping to the side to reveal an awkward Antonio just down the path that leads to the door.

“The hell are you still doing here?” I call out to Antonio. He doesn’t move an inch or say anything in return. He’s like a statue.

“Hey, T,” Dad shouts in greeting from the living room.

“Mike! My man!” Taylor weaves past me to go inside and chat it up with Dad. My eyes haven’t moved off of Antonio. We’re having yet another stare down, apparently.

It’s only been a few seconds, but I’ve had enough. I leave the door open behind me and march right up to my neighbor, pointing a finger in his face.

“Listen, if you’re gonna be a creep, go do it somewhere else!”

“My mom is making empanadas. Do you and your skater friend wanna come over and have some?” Antonio asks with an eerie head tilt. It’s off-putting, but somehow… it’s also slightly endearing?

Anything I was going to say suddenly dies in my throat. Have I been reading it all wrong? Is he actually just a super awkward teenager?

“I… huh?” I mumble dumbly.

“I told my mom about my new friend, so she started making empanadas for us to share.”

“I *love* free food,” Taylor says after he comes waltzing out of the house. My house. How long has he been listening in?

“Let’s go, then,” Antonio says. He doesn’t wait for us to follow- he simply starts walking down the sidewalk.

“C’mon, June. You can protect me if he’s a murderer,” Taylor jokes, nudging me with his elbow. He drops his skateboard to the ground and hops on it with that trademark grin I can’t stand. Damn, he makes it look so easy! Taylor zips down the street, looping us several times as we make our way to Antonio’s house. Besides the sound of the skateboard’s wheels whistling on the road, we walk in total silence.

When we get there, the first thing I notice is their evenly trimmed front lawn. Not a single blade of silky grass sticks out above the rest. Donnie could never, ever mow ours like this. Additionally, their porch is completely bare. Not a single wind chime, uneven chair, or potted plant sits on those perfectly painted wooden planks. It’s all so… plain.

Antonio leads us inside after instructing Taylor to set his skateboard down by the door. The innards of the house match the outside’s boring and underwhelming touch. White walls, basic furniture, and clinically clean surfaces surround us. The only sign of life under this roof is the tantalizing scent of the empanadas. Maybe it’s because they’re still new to the neighborhood. That’s what I’m telling myself, at least.

“I brought them,” Antonio calls as we walk into the kitchen. The way he says it makes me feel like we’re the missing ingredients that he went and fetched for his mother‘s empanadas.

His mother turns from the running sink with a wide smile. For the most part, everything about her is normal- beautiful, even. She has wildly curly hair just like her son’s. It’s pulled back in a high ponytail that goes down to her hips. Her figure is on the heavier side and her eyes are a sweet honey-brown.

The one thing that has me feeling uneasy, though? Her eyebrows. They’re curved upwards in an expression that is usually associated with showing concern. Even so, she’s still smiling. It’s an odd look and it has goosebumps bubbling up on my skin from head to toe.

“Oh, hello there! Welcome to The Hernandez Home!” Antonio’s mom greets us, her smile somehow widening further.

“Thanks, Miss Hernandez,” Taylor says, and I quickly echoe his sentiment.

“Go ahead and sit down, I’ll bring the empanadas as soon as they’re done.” Miss Hernandez waves us off with an airy chuckle.

I follow the boys quietly to the table. I can’t help but feel unsettled by her face, but I realize how mean that sounds in my head and shake it off. I shouldn’t be so judgmental. Her face might just be… *like* that.

We’ve barely settled in our seats when the sound of a door creaking open breaks through the slightly awkward silence. I look up and spot a tall figure approaching from down the hall.

“You must be Antonio’s friends,” the stranger says as he walks into the light. It’s an older man. He’s dressed in your stereotypical doctor’s white coat and some semi-formal pants. He has gelled black hair, a perfectly maintained mustache, and… wait for it… bright green eyes.

“Pretty much,” Taylor says with a shrug. I nudge him harshly with my leg beneath the table.

“Yes. I made new friends today. June Robinson and Taylor Krol,” Antonio says robotically and folds his hands on the table like an evil little genius.

“That’s great news, Antonio,” the man says with a charming smile. He reaches out a hand to both Taylor and I. “I’m Doctor Hernandez- but you two can call me Bruno if you’d like. I’m Antonio’s father.”

While I hesitate, Taylor takes the hand of the crisp-clean man and shakes it.

“Fancy. What kind of doctor?” The ginger asks.

“Of the brain variety. I’m a neurosurgeon,” Bruno says with that same megawatt smile.

I narrow my eyes before taking his hand and shaking it. His hand is uncomfortably squishy and cold.

“Sorry for the handshake, kids. Force of habit,” The doctor says with a sheepish chuckle. He adjusts his tie in what looks to be a nervous habit.

“… Are you going to work?” Antonio asks.

“I sure am. Though I have some extra time before I go, so I think I’ll crash your empanada party until then.” Bruno takes a seat at the head of the table. His laser beam eyes scan us over in quiet observation.

I decide that Miss Hernandez is my favorite superhero when she brings the steaming empanadas out. They’re expertly piled into a large, white bowl that she sets down at the center of the table. Her eyebrows are still upturned.

“Just in time,” she hums.

“Thanks, sweetheart,” Bruno murmurs, taking one from the golden-brown pile before anyone else can and chewing thoughtfully. His eyes are on me for a reason I can’t pinpoint. It makes my skin crawl. Now that we’re all seated together, I feel less tense, but it’d be even better if Bruno wasn’t here.

“So, June. You live in this neighborhood, right? A shame our families haven’t run into each other before,” the doctor comments after swallowing.

“Uhh, yeah. I’ve lived here a long time,” I reply. I’m holding an empanada, but I still haven’t taken a bite. Taylor’s already on his second and Antonio is watching him inhale each one in silent shock.

“Wonderful. It’s a gorgeous neighborhood, really. Now that you’ve already met Antonio, I’d love for my wife and I to befriend your parents and join in on the community.”

“… My dad isn’t super involved with the others in the neighborhood,” I mumble, taking a rougher bite of my empanada with a hardened expression. I’m defensive and I’m not bothering to hide it.

“Is that so? Hah… Judging by your reaction, I can tell you’re very protective of your father. Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?” Bruno asks, propping his chin up on his hand and studying my expressions with a knowing gleam in his eye.

“We love each other very much and we’d never let anything happen to each other. It goes both ways,” I say, shaking my head.

“How can you tell?” Taylor asks, looking confused. “That she’s protective, I mean.”

The doctor chuckles at a joke none of us understand and says, “I’m a neurosurgeon, son. I’ve studied human brains of all varieties for many years. That includes the correlation between the brain, behavior, and emotions. I could go on, but because it’s hard to explain all of it in a short answer, I’ll spare you. Along with studying those kinds of things, I’m also very skilled at reading people and their emotions.”

Taylor is very fascinated by this freak-ass doctor. I couldn’t be any less interested in learning more about the things he does with brains all day. Taylor continues his fun little Q&A with Bruno, but I tune them out. I tune everyone out and just focus on the food. Chewing. Swallowing. Repeat. Autopilot is my best friend.

I’m yanked out of my trance when Bruno stands up and straightens out that damn tie again.

“Well, I’ve used up all my excess time. I’ve got to head to work and get started on paperwork for a new patient, so I have my work cut out for me. It was nice meeting the two of you,” He says to us.

I notice something strange. Bruno doesn’t say goodbye to his family or even acknowledge them on his way out. It’s almost like they’re invisible to him, or ghosts only Taylor and I can see. He just strides to the front door with determination and disappears behind it.

I don’t like Doctor Hernandez.

Load up MCU figures with accessories. Really give em' all ya' got! As an example, like the Target exclusive Black Widow, at the lest. Even if some of the accessories are rereleases of stuff we've gotten a lot of, like beakers and test tubes... Who doesn't need more beakers and test tubes? Right? 

Make the accessories, somewhat, and slightly, generic enough that you can use them for comic, movie, and gaming figures. Y'know, test tubes, beakers, tv remotes, soda bottles, newspapers, guns, knives, power tools, coffee mugs, screwdrivers, wrenches, a note pad, an ipad, a first aid kit, a fire extinguisher, cell phones, walki-talkies, etc.

What are your thoughts and suggestions? Other than making better movies and shows that people would want to see, and be more interested in, What would YOU do to get more people buying MCU figures so Hasbro makes more MCU figures for us often maligned, but, I presume, well meaning MCU collectors?

Between the RBA's latest moves and the ATO getting much stricter with their digital tracking, just ""keeping your head above water"" is becoming a full-time job.

But there is one massive change coming that most small business owners aren't talking about yet: **Payday Super.**

# The End of the ""Quarterly Cushion""

For years, we’ve all been used to the quarterly superannuation cycle. It gave us a bit of a cash flow ""cushion""—you’d have that money in the bank for a few months before you had to send it off.

But from July 2026, that cushion is disappearing. You’ll have to pay your staff's super at the exact same time you pay their wages. If you pay weekly, the super goes out weekly. No more ""holding onto it"" to cover other bills. For a lot of Sydney businesses already dealing with high rents and rising electricity costs, this is going to be a massive shock to the system.

# Why You Can't Just ""Wing It"" Anymore

In the old days, you could probably fix a mistake a few weeks later. But in 2026, the ATO’s computers are talking to your payroll software in real-time. If you’re late, or if the numbers don't match, you’re going to get a ""please explain"" email before you’ve even finished your morning coffee.

This is exactly why so many local founders are starting to look for a [virtual cfo sydney](https://www.dnagrowth.com/virtual-cfo-services/).

# How a Virtual CFO Saves Your Saturday

A Virtual CFO isn't just someone who tells you how much tax you owe. They are like a ""financial architect"" who helps you redesign your business to handle these new rules. They help you:

* **Fix the Cash Flow Leak:** They’ll help you find where your money is getting stuck so you have the cash ready for Payday Super every single week.
* **Predict the ""ATO Storms"":** They look at the next 6–12 months so you aren't surprised by big bills or regulatory changes.
* **Make Modern Decisions:** Should you use AI to automate your invoicing? Is it time to raise your prices to cover higher wages? They give you the answer based on data, not just a ""gut feeling.""

# Don't Wait for the Deadline

The businesses that thrive in Sydney aren't the ones that work the hardest—they’re the ones that have the best systems. You don't need a full-time executive to get this right; you just need a pro who knows the Sydney market and understands the 2026 landscape.",1,1771589356.0,DNAGrowth,0,1.0,False

Minor revisions, passed, the whole thing. I have been in PhD programs for five years and I have spent basically that entire time operating under the assumption that I was one bad meeting away from someone figuring out I didn't belong there. I thought defending would turn that off like a switch. It did not.



I'm currently in a postdoc position that starts in March at the same institution, same building, probably the same coffee machine. My advisor is now technically my collaborator. I ran into her in the hallway yesterday and instinctively started preparing an update on my progress before I remembered I don't have to do that anymore. She just asked how I was feeling and I said ""good, weird"" and that was the whole conversation. I genuinely do not know how to exist in this building without the structure of being someone's student. I don't know how to talk to faculty as someone who is nominally a peer now. I keep second-guessing whether I'm allowed to have opinions in conversations I would have stayed quiet in six days ago.



I'm asking because I want to know if this is a transition that actually happens at some point, or if the people who seem comfortable and confident in academic spaces are just running the same internal monologue and got better at not showing it. I've read that imposter syndrome is common in academia but that framing has always felt a bit too tidy to me, like it explains the feeling without actually telling you what to do with it. If you went through this, what actually shifted for you, and was it something you did or just time doing it on its own.

I wanted like to share a travel experience that mixes fashion with a little bit of personal growth moment haha! My style leans on chic pieces, pop of colors, and loves to mix and match vintage, statement to casual pieces. But that wasn't the main deal…it was how I intentionally packed way less than usual during my trip to Vietnam last year. 

Im a guilty overpacker. I plan outfits way ahead of time before I travel. I need to have a brunch outfit, a day walk outfit, night walk outfit, explore street foods outfit, coffee shop hopping outfit, every mundane event you can think of… I MUST have an outfit ready. If I could, Id bring my entire wardrobe. But this time, I held so much of myself back!!! I didn’t overpack. I was trembling closing that suitcase LOL. I didn’t bring as many clothes, but mind you, I brought so much of my money! here’s why… 

I’ve heard how shopping for clothing pieces (and trendy ones) is the sole, or one of the reasons why girlies travel to Vietnam, so I had to leave a lot of space in my luggage. I had to hop on and see for myself. And it was AMAZING. it was like I was shopping straight out of my Pinterest boards. I visited Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi and targeted these spots because they had everything fashion related. They have accessories, dresses, bags, boots. Tho i suggest you have to try on things/clothes before buying because some pieces look very different on the hanger vs when worn. 

Long story short, I came home overpacked, luggage overflowing lol. One of the things I learned travelling here was not just to pack lighter and more intentional to make traveling easier, but also to leave room for the experience. I didnt have to stress about fitting new pieces into an already outstuffed suitcase. Honestly would 100% go back and do it again.

The incident took place last week when I was getting ready for the office. I was in a hurry and can't step out without a coffee, so I decided to multitask.

I put my Moka pot on the stove and stepped away for 2-3 minutes. I returned to see the extraction was darker than ever. Before I could react, there was a full-blown blast. The coffee blew out of the spout and my neck was the epicenter.

The next thing I felt was a sharp pain in my eye. I noticed it was filled with ground coffee; hot and burning. I rushed to rinse my eyes, scared because I had an eye operation last year for a rare disease. This could have been very bad for the eye.

As my wife and maid were around, they worried about me for some time but were quickly distracted by the splatters everywhere. The volcano was so strong that the wall opposite the stove was covered with coffee stains. A quick RCA concluded that I had forgotten to put in the filter plate.

I was a little relieved to see the eye had only some hints of redness and was not hurting either. I used my eye drops from the operation, which are supposed to heal the cornea. The first 24 hours were very scary, as my eye felt dry, but it felt better after two days.

Now, I get nervous around the Moka pot and use it only on weekends when I have all the time, to avoid negligence. I wear glasses in the kitchen and have a well-defined written SOP.

But it's more than that, i am 30, never been in a relationship, i am overweight, i am depressed, shy, weird, and have so many otber problems that drive any woman away. 

I know of only one woman that ever were attracted to me romantically, but she fell for someone else and they dated for a while. 

My grandma told me ""i think you need help"", but her help is finding someone religious that lives incredibly far she doesn't even know if they are available, applications suck and i am not someone who can ""pick up"" someone. 

So in the end, nothing is solved and i feel bad because i tried to talk with my grandma and do something nice.

Over the past 7+ years of rebuilding my nervous system, brain health, and vitality, I’ve explored a wide range of modalities.

This isn’t medical advice.

Just my lived experience.

⸻

🌎 Plant Medicine & Psychedelic-Assisted Work

• Ibogaine (deep neuroplastic and trauma work in supervised setting)

• Ayahuasca (ceremonial plant medicine)

• Psilocybin / Magic Mushrooms (introspective work)

• DMT (short-acting psychedelic experience)

• Changa (DMT-infused herbal blend, more visual experience)

• Yopo (traditional DMT-containing snuff)

• 5-MeO-DMT / Bufo Alvarius (intense non-dual experience)

• San Pedro (mescaline-containing cactus ceremony)

• MDMA (therapeutic setting for emotional processing)

• Rapé (sacred tobacco snuff used ceremonially)

• Sananga (traditional Amazonian eye drops)

• Cacao ceremonies (heart-opening ritual setting)

⸻

🧠 Nervous System & Brain Support

• NeurOptimal (neurofeedback for brain regulation)

• Breathwork – Holotropic & Wim Hof (nervous system regulation)

• Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (oxygen under pressure for recovery)

• Infrared Sauna + Red Light (circulation & recovery support)

• Ice baths (cold exposure for resilience)

• Peptides – BPC-157, TB-500, Semax, Cerebrolysin (research compounds used in recovery settings)

• NAD support (cellular energy support)

• Methylene Blue (mitochondrial support, used cautiously)

⸻

🩸 Regenerative & Cellular Therapies

• Stem Cells (regenerative therapy)

• Ozone therapy – IV & rectal (oxidative therapy used in some integrative clinics)

• Chelation (heavy metal detox protocol under supervision)

• Shockwave therapy (acoustic wave therapy for circulation support)

• Energy Enhancement System (frequency-based modality)

⸻

🥩 Foundational Lifestyle (The Real Game Changers)

• Animal-based diet (protein prioritized)

• Recently reintroduced carbs successfully

• Creatine (muscle & cognitive support)

• Methylated B12 (methylation support)

• L-Glutamine (gut support)

• CoQ10 (mitochondrial support)

• Lion’s Mane (cognitive support mushroom)

• Reishi (adaptogenic mushroom)

• Chaga (immune-support mushroom)

• Probiotics (gut health)

• Reverse osmosis water (filtration system)

• Mineral baths – Epsom salts

• Borax detox bath (topical mineral soak)

•Pine Pollen 

⸻

🌿 Other Modalities Explored

• Colonics (colon hydrotherapy)

• Coffee enemas (used in some detox protocols)

• Kambo (Amazonian frog secretion ceremony)

• Mambe (traditional coca leaf preparation)

• Phototherapy patches (light-based signaling technology)

⸻

And yes — there are a few advanced or highly specialized modalities I’ve explored that aren’t appropriate to detail on social media.

Not because they’re secret — but because context, screening, and professional oversight matter.

If you’re genuinely interested in having a responsible, informed conversation about certain advanced protocols, feel free to send me a message.

Some things aren’t for mass conversation. They’re for responsible dialogue.

⸻

Healing wasn’t one thing.

It was nervous system regulation.

Inflammation reduction.

Trauma processing.

Cellular energy rebuilding.

Consistency.

Not everything is for everyone.

Do your research. Work with qualified professionals.

Because of batch size much bigger compared to my previous roaster (from 200-250g going to 600-700g) I am planning the size of my next green beans orders.

I was ordering 1kg of every coffee before (250g x4 roasts). Now I am thinking more like 2kg split in 666g (3 roasts).

Then I thought what if I sample roast with the Bullet (150g max 200g) and keep this quantity inside the ""green budget""....doable.

Then the question: if I manage to successfully sample roast 150g or 200g (Rob Hoss, Steffen Lav etc.), how do I actually translate the profile to the full 600g / 700g batch? Obviously I'd need a completely different power curve and charging temp.

Should I manually control the roast while checking the original sample curve (overlay function, for example) or what would be the best way?

Until now I was roasting 500g batches (because of the size of my previous green supply from when I had the other roaster) and was slightly correcting from roast to roast (no roast was every completely failed).",1,1771587783.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

1r9t3u3,https://i.redd.it/gqszltlgzmkg1.jpeg,Big Law Associate instagrammer template for aspiring lawyers to network online - thoughts?,"So this is not to start a personal comment on the creator of this post - more so a discussion. I was flicking through instagram the other day and saw this template written by a BigLaw associate in the UK to essentially network with people. 

From my perspective, there are a few problems: 

1. you can’t assume you have the same ‘background’ as someone even if you’ve come from the same city, went to the same uni, even the same ethnicity etc. Some people also don’t view their struggles in the same way that you might. You risk ruffling some feathers by assuming similarity;

2. Saying that, I like how it shows you’ve atleast looked at my profile (many people don’t make their messages tailored at all);

3. If you ask me to talk through my “journey” I probably just won’t respond (maybe I’m just a knob but I get so many LinkedIn DMs from aspiring lawyers). If you want to know something specific, tell me what you want to know and I’ll happily meet for a chat. I also know you don’t really care about my journey, you want to know how you can get a TC and probably network with me because you like my firm, that’s fine, just be upfront. I’ve been the victim of many of these “journey chats” before and people come unprepared and it’s often a waste of time for both parties. 

Like I said, not looking to criticise this creator at all, this is just my opinion. ",3,1771587589.0,uklaw,12,0.71,False

Sneezing like that usually means:

Your sinuses finally opened
Pressure dropped
Inflammatory junk is evacuating

That’s actually a good sign.

Quick roadside protocol:

• Keep tissues handy
• Blow gently, not forcefully
• Sip water between sneezes
• Try to breathe through your nose when you can
• If available, warm coffee or tea helps open passages

If your eyes start watering or ears feel full:

That’s drainage shifting. Totally normal.

Once you’re home:

Steam + saline rinse.

That will finish the job.

Today I realised I have light brown ‘stuff’ at the base of three of my teeth. At the touch it doesn’t hurt or anything, it just feels kinda rough in texture, and to be honest I have no clue for how long it’s been there. I also have another dark thing, more on my gum than my tooth, just under one single tooth in the other side of my mouth.

I brush my teeth twice a day religiously, but I never really floss or use mouthwash (I know I know I should). At least I can say that with my toothbrush I make sure to be extremely thorough, even with the wisdom teeth at the back.

I never ever had cavities in my life, I drink coffee very rarely, I don’t drink alcohol and I don’t smoke either.

I have skipped going to the dentist for the annual cleaning since a few years, since I moved to a different country and before moving I was always somewhere else in the summer and had to cancel the appointments. I suppose that that might be a reason.

I’m gonna schedule an appointment with a dentist asap, abut in the meantime I ask your opinion. Is it just staining or it might be cavities?",1,1771586905.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1r9svye,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1r9svye/rp_need_to_find/,RP: need to find,"🔞💥My werewolf mate had cheated on me. I stood outside the Alpha conference room and through the half-open doorway, I witnessed him entangled with another female werewolf. His fingers threaded through her blonde hair and his lips pressed against her neck, just as he had once done to me. Even though as a human I couldn't feel the pain of a torn mate bond, the sight still made me choke with nausea. Eight years of my life melted into pieces in this moment. My legs feel like they're frozen, my heels nailed dead to the marble floor. An inner voice laughs at my naivety-a human trying to hold onto a werewolf's heart forever. My throat tightens and my stomach turns, and I force myself not to break down on the spot. After what felt like an eternity, I finally raised my hand and knocked. ""Come in,"" a deep, husky voice called from inside. My fingers tightened around the files I was holding, my knuckles turning white as I struggled to maintain my composure. The other pack members might sense my distress if I didn't keep myself under control. As a human married to the Alpha of Blood Moon Pack, I had learned to mask my emotions well. As I pushed the door open, I forced my lips into a practiced smile. I walked directly to Xavier's side, careful not to inhale too deeply. I didn't want to smell her on him – that other female whose scent had been lingering around our home for weeks. ""Busy?"" I asked, my tone deliberately light. ""I have some documents that need your signature."" My question was purely rhetorical. I had already placed the files in front of him, helpfully turned to the pages requiring his signature. My perfect act, still performing even as my heart turned to stone. Xavier had just returned from Switzerland this morning. He'd gone straight to the office to catch up on work, and his desk was already covered with paperwork. Fatigue marked his handsome face, though I knew the real reason for his exhaustion had nothing to do with business meetings. Without even glancing at what I'd brought, he signed every document. ""Thanks for handling this,"" he said, still not looking up. I gathered the signed papers, tucking them carefully against my chest. ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?"" I asked, though I already knew the answer. ""I've got plans. Don't wait up for me,"" he replied dismissively, attention already shifted back to his computer. ""Alright, I'll see you later then,"" I said, turning to leave. The moment my back was to him, my smile twisted into something cold and bitter. The facade of the devoted Luna crumbled with each step I took toward the door. As I passed the attached rest area of his office, I heard a soft thump from inside, like someone small trying to move quietly.My eyes darted to the side, taking in the scene: scattered snack packages on the coffee table, a half-empty bubble tea, and a pale pink high heel toppled on its side on the floor. In that instant, my heart turned to ash. The walk back to my own office depleted whatever energy I had left. I collapsed into my chair, exhaling a long, defeated breath. From among the stack of papers, I pulled out one specific document. Divorce papers. I flipped to the final page, tracing Xavier's signature with a mixture of vindication and sorrow. Memories flooded my mind... how he'd once vowed that I was his one true mate, how fiercely he had pursued me in high school, insisting that even though I was human, the Moon Goddess had destined us for each other. I remembered how Dora, his mother and the Elder Luna, had sneered at me, warning me not to get too comfortable. ""Wolves may claim to mate for life,"" she'd said, ""but an Alpha male will never be satisfied with just one woman, especially a human one."" I had defended him then. ""Xavier is different,"" I'd insisted. ""Our bond is different."" How naive I had been. He wasn't different at all. He'd cheated with a younger wolf girl, foolishly believing he was hiding it well. All while enjoying the thrill of his infidelity. He'd even taken her on his business trip, and then had the audacity to bring her back to the pack's headquarters. I snapped a photo of his signature and sent it to Luna Dora with a simple message: He signed it. A week ago, I had negotiated terms with Luna Dora. She wanted me to initiate the divorce quietly, keeping our secret marriage from becoming pack gossip. In return, I demanded ten million dollars in compensation. In one month, Xavier would be completely removed from my life. ... A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. I quickly hid the divorce papers. ""Come in,"" I called out. Henry, Xavier's Beta assistant, entered my office. ""Luna Cecilia, Alpha Xavier asked me to deliver this to you,"" he said, placing a dark green velvet box on my desk. I opened it casually, revealing an obscenely expensive diamond set. But instead of feeling pleased, all I could picture was the short-haired girl wearing nothing but a bathrobe, playfully dangling a similar diamond necklace. I imagined the dim, romantic lighting, the rumpled bedsheets, and the kiss marks dotting her neck and chest that Xavier had left as he betrayed me. The bile of betrayal rose in my throat, thick and bitter.I reminded myself--one more month. Just one. I've had enough of playing the dutiful Luna in a kingdom built on lies. Nothing will derail my exit this time. ""Thank you, Beta Henry,"" I said, looking up with eyes that could cut glass. ""The Alpha picked it himself,"" he added hastily, voice cracking. ""It's one of a kind. There's nothing else like it in the world."" Pity his loyalty isn't as rare as his taste in jewelry. I had no desire to wear anything he'd touched after touching her. I curled my lips into a smile sharp enough to draw blood. ""How thoughtful of him,"" I said sweetly. ""Imagine finding time for jewelry shopping in between board meetings... and bedroom visits."" I could practically hear Beta Henry's soul trying to climb out of his body. They didn't expect that I knew Xavier had cheated on me long ago.Fear radiated from him as he quickly excused himself from my office. Once he fled, I stared down at the diamonds like they were crawling with maggots. My fingers flew over the screen, finding the contact saved as 'LUXE RESALE - Elena'. The photo attached with a satisfying ping. My message was terse, final: \[This set. Sell immediately. Liquidate. Donate every cent to the Sunrise Pediatric Rehab Center.\] \[Estimated market value exceeds $500,000. Are you sure?\] \[Looking at it makes me sick. Get rid of it. Yesterday.\] \[...Okay.\] ... 5:00 PM. Parking garage. I had just reached my car and was opening the door when my eyes inadvertently drifted across the lot. A sleek black SUV was already running, and through the window, I could see Xavier in the back seat. Pressed against him was a girl with short hair and a round, youthful face, radiating the boundless energy of youth that apparently my Alpha mate found irresistible. ""Alpha Xavier!"" Beta Henry's panicked voice rang out as tires screeched. He slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. Through the thick pane of glass, Xavier's eyes locked with mine. His gaze flared, black with fury. Mine stayed flat. Dead. Hollow. Across that silence, the girl noticed me--but instead of pulling away, she doubled down, looping her arms around his neck, her lips brushing his ear with a whisper. My eyes burned as if someone had thrown acid into them. The partial mate bond, even incomplete as ours was, made witnessing his betrayal physically painful.I know she is swearing sovereignty to me, which is a provocation. I tore my gaze away, slipped into my car, and drove off without a second glance in their direction. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to confront them, to challenge her--but I wasn't a wolf. I was just a human who had been foolish enough to believe in forever with an Alpha. When I arrived home to our spacious penthouse apartment, it wasn't long before I heard the sound of Xavier's car pulling into the garage beneath us. The sound made my stomach clench with dread and anger. I stood in our walk-in closet, removing the diamond necklace he'd given me last month--another guilt offering I now realized--when a wall of muscle pressed against my back. The familiar cedar cold scent that had once brought me comfort now made my skin crawl. Xavier braced his hands on the glass cabinet on either side of me, leaning down to peer at my face from the side. ""Are you angry?"" His voice carried that commanding Alpha tone that had once made me weak at the knees. Without looking at him, I carefully placed the necklace back in its box with deliberate slowness. My voice was ice when I finally spoke. ""Angry enough to commit murder. You'd better watch your back."" Xavier stared at me in silence for a long moment, his wolf clearly assessing the threat in my words. Finally, he spoke again, his tone carefully measured. ""The White family is interested in collaborating with us on the Nova Star project. I've been in discussions with Gavin, their eldest son. The girl you saw is his sister."" ""What, you need to entertain his sister to secure his business?"" I turned to face him, my gaze piercing. ""Is that how Blood Moon Pack conducts business now?"" ""Cecilia, I'm trying to explain. Stop with the attitude!"" His Alpha voice slipped out, a desperate attempt to control the situation. ""There's nothing to explain,"" I finally turned to look at him, my eyes clear and cold, peering into his soul. ""Xavier, if you're tired of me and want she to be the Luna of this pack, I'm willing to step aside."" Xavier's face darkened instantly. ""What did you just say?"" His wolfish side is about to appear, eyes flashing with gold. I sighed. ""I said, we can get divorced."" When I tried to walk away, he grabbed me and pulled me back forcefully. Xavier gripped my chin, his fingers pressing into my skin as he growled a warning. ""You'd better not even think about that."" I remained silent. Not only had I thought about it--I'd already set it in motion. I. Was. Done with him. Xavier stayed home late that night, but was summoned away by a phone call. I clearly heard a soft, feminine voice on the other end, whimpering like she was crying. The next morning, my lawyer friend and confidante,Harper sent me a screenshot: his little girlfriend's latest social media update. It showed a sunrise from a mountaintop, with two hands forming a heart shape--one large, one small. The caption read: ""Feeling each other's heartbeats in the gentle embrace of the sunrise."" I recognized Xavier's hand immediately. The bond between us may have been incomplete, but I knew every inch of him--every scar, every callus. I sat there, holding my water glass for who knows how long. For several days after that, Xavier didn't come home. We only saw each other at company meetings. He sat in the center seat as Alpha, while I sat with the other executives. We never once made eye contact during those meetings.I didn't bother going to his office. In my spare time, I busied myself with finding a new place to live, viewing apartments, and getting rid of all the gifts he'd given me over the years--anniversary presents, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day tokens, wedding gifts... I even sold my wedding ring. When you no longer want the person, what's the point in keeping the emotional garbage of your past? ... That evening, Ana, the owner of the Jade Palace club, invited me out. It was nearly eleven o'clock, and I initially didn't want to go, but considering that after divorcing and leaving Blood Moon Pack's company, I would need my own network of connections to start my business, I decided to accept. As soon as I entered the club, I spotted Ana. ""Ana, I could have found my way up. You didn't need to come down,"" I said with a smile that didn't reach my eyes. Ana linked her arm with mine affectionately as we entered the elevator. ""I was worried you might get lost, honey. You've never been here before, right?"" That was true. This was my first time here. We went upstairs, and Ana led me into a large private room divided by an ornate Chinese-style screen in the center. Upon entering, I noticed several people on the other side of the screen, but Ana didn't lead me there. Instead, she took me to the side where only one person sat--someone who looked vaguely familiar. I recognized her as the girlfriend of one of Xavier's friends. She seemed to recognize me too, and her expression turned awkward, though she managed a small smile. After I took off my coat and sat down, Ana left again. I took a sip of the drink placed before me, and gradually the boisterous conversation from the other side of the screen reached my ears. As they continued talking, they began discussing me. ""When it comes to this, Xavier hasn't brought that human to the party lately,"" a voice said with contempt. ""It's obvious. Cici has purebred Alpha heritage--young, gorgeous, and the real deal. Xavier flaunts her at every event like she's some prize jewel. He doesn't bother hiding his human wife anymore."" Another voice echoes. ""I finally got my idea. After eight years, Xavier finally figured out the importance of bloodline."" ""No matter how beautiful a human is, it's just a plaything. Eight years, tsk, it's so patient. What can human women have? They can't even mark it."" ""And she is so stupid, she has been fooled for so long and kept in the dark. She think she can really be Luna? She has been useless for so many years except for a beautiful face and a good figure."" Someone laughed, ""I want me to say that when Xavier is completely tired of it, I don't mind taking over to comfort her. I've been coveting that slim waist for a long time."" ""Be careful, human women cannot withstand the power of our werewolf,"" another voice joined in teasing with a nasty hint. I stood around the corner, my eyes cold. I am very familiar with these voices - they are all Xavier's friends, and they call me ""Luna"" intimately when they see me. Now that he has revealed his true face, he just treats me as a joke in their circle. The woman sitting with me looked so uncomfortable she couldn't even meet my eyes. When she saw me stand up, she probably thought I was going to flee in humiliation. Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and walked toward the screen. I leaned against it casually and joined their conversation in a relaxed tone. ""Gentlemen, I couldn't help overhearing--and I think you've got the story a little backward."" Their laughter choked off. ""When Xavier first got with me,"" I continued, tilting my head with mock sweetness, ""he was just a sweet little inexperienced Alpha, all awkward hands and wide-eyed promises.

I get why that's the case because pain is not fun, but I just wanna put out a positive story out there. It's gonna be long. I'm sorry for being long-winded.



I was 23 when I got diagnosed with Cervical Spondylosis and it was during a very turbulent time: which is a civil war that is still on-going because I'm in Myanmar. 



I've always had unexplained symptoms which I just chalked up to my bundle of (untreated) mental health problems and my sleep issues. I was always dissatisfied with life, always trying to chase achievements, always so stressed about everything in my life, always needing to be ""needed"" by people and so afraid of being perceived as weak or vulnerable. I always had chronic pain that I chalked up as growing pains, then later when it persisted into adult life I chalked it up as ""just being an adult"" because it turns out people are dismissive of you when you talk to them about pain, and they will one-up you whenever they can. I cannot tell you how many times I've heard things like ""Oh, a headache? I've got something worse"" or ""Oh, you have back pain? Me too AND I'm sleep-deprived."" 



The first time I went to check up, I was 22 and I only got diagnosed as having a pinched nerve in my neck. It felt like a temporary thing, which only made me think I had to just ""tough it out"" but when I finally got diagnosed with osteoarthritis, my doctor looked me dead in the eye and said, ""this is a chronic condition. It might get better or it might get worse. I get that you're young and you feel like you have to try so hard for your future. But you came to this clinic with your mother and no one else. When something like this happens in the future, it will be the same. You will only have your loved ones and your bosses and your clients will not be there. Make sure you take care of yourself, and don't overwork."" Needless to say, I went home and cried but days after my flare up died down, I realized how right he was.



That was three years ago. Since then, it's been a sort-of-long journey of figuring out myself, my new life and who really care about me during hard times. I started forgiving myself for things I can't do, especially for things that I feel like I ""must"" do. It's very freeing to have a diagnosis, even if it doesn't feel like it in the beginning. You have a name to the thing tormenting you every single day, and every time I hear horror stories of people who are in pain and do not know what they have, I'm very grateful of the fact that I know what's happening to me.



Don't get me wrong, chronic pain still sucks. And I'm not like this because I only have a mild condition -- which I've been told sarcastically at when I share my story like this. I have Cervical Spondylosis pressing on my C5-C6 and C6-C7 nerves and Sciatica. I'm a part-time cane user, my hands suck and I have muscle spasms. But since my diagnosis, I've been less stressed about what other people think of me. I've got a better handle on my mental health conditions because every time I get socially anxious, I look at my shaky hands and think ""why do I care about their opinions?"" and it turns out it's very easy to tune out a lot of negative thoughts or opinions when I'm having to bodily experience my pain. My doctor was right. Those people will never come with me to the clinic, they will never buy me pain meds when I can't get up from bed, they will not listen to me talk about what my symptoms are today. And my depression is still there, but it's in the background because instead of feeling like everything is so fleeting, feeling like I'm numb, feeling like I need to fill the hole in my heart of something, I just drink my coffee and appreciate the amount of effort I put into make that cup of coffee. I can't be mad or sad or feel numb about my life when the cup of coffee I made is so tasty.



I also have to mention that while my social life, work and education took a dip during the first few months I got diagnosed, it's actually better than ever now. I love learning and I love working so I got a bit more depressed after my diagnosis because I thought I will have to give those up. But then I realized I just have to live my life differently, not less. 



Now, I'm much more physically active because I've learned that even a little movement goes a long way. I make spontaneous plans with my friends when I wake up with a lot of energy, and it turns out most people crave social connections as well so they will make time for you, even if it's only a thirty minute chat over coffee or lunch. I meet up with my friends to do random activities like swimming, archery or pottery painting, craft workshops and if we like it a lot, we try to do that once every few months together. I'm not afraid to cancel my plans because people who stayed as my friends genuinely cared about me. I figured out how to manage my energy and my time to work efficiently, which I never figured out before as a young adult. I realize now that if I didn't get diagnosed, my work system would still be a mess. I also learned how to learn stuff without putting too much pressure onto myself, which led to me learning a lot more things because it turns out you can remember so much more when you're not forcing yourself to learn things. I learned a lot about chronic conditions, illnesses, pain, medications, nutrition and much more. I learned how to cope with both mental and physical symptoms, which I never learned before because society taught me wrongfully that anything less than toughing it out is weak.



Some days are completely bad, still. Right now, I'm on day 4 of being sick because I caught a flu when I went to my clinic. I have a canker sore, a lot of physical pain and a few pills are waiting for me so that I can go to sleep and wake up on time for my clinic appointment tomorrow. It's still tough, but I've been thinking about writing this for a few weeks now and I'm very happy that I finally have the energy today to type these all out.



If you're newly diagnosed, I want to tell you that most people who have your condition, but are doing fine are not on public forums telling you they're fine because when it's fine, it's nothing to talk about. However, that means most things you see about your condition is negative. It doesn't mean your life will only get worse. You can find what works for you.

1r9snzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiTools4Youu/comments/1r9snzz/im_a_founder_not_a_recruiter_heres_how_using/,"I’m a founder, not a recruiter. Here's how using Arbeo stopped me from drowning in 400+ terrible resumes.","Whenever we open a new role, the sheer volume of applications is completely overwhelming. We don't have a dedicated HR department it’s just me and my co-founder running operations.

Last month, we put up a posting for a mid-level project manager. Within 48 hours, we had over 400 applications in our inbox. I spent my entire Sunday trying to filter them, and it was soul-crushing. People were applying who clearly didn’t even read the job description (I got a resume from a local pastry chef for a tech PM role).

I realized our workflow was broken and I was wasting hours of high-leverage time doing low-level filtering. I finally revamped how we handle hiring to save my sanity. Here is the exact framework we use now:

1. **Brutally specific requirements:** I stopped using generic templates downloaded from Google. The first line of the description now outlines the exact dealbreakers (e.g., ""Do not apply if you do not have 3+ years of B2B SaaS experience. We will not train you on this."").
2. **The ""Secret Word"" test:** Buried in the third paragraph, I ask them to include a specific word (like ""Pineapple"") in their cover letter or the first line of their intro email. If it's not there, I instantly delete the application. It weeds out 50% of the spam bot applicants immediately.
3. **Scoring tech over manual review:** I realized traditional ATS platforms (like Greenhouse or Workable) are massive overkill for us. They require training and cost an arm and a leg. I recently switched to Arbeo. It acts like a simple Kanban board but uses AI to automatically score candidate fit against my exact job description. It even pulls in their GitHub or portfolios if they forgot to link them.

Now, I only look at the top 15% of candidates that the AI flags as a high-match, and I drag them to the ""Interview"" column. It turned a 10-hour Sunday chore into a 30-minute task over coffee.

(29M & 28F in an LDR),"I'm a bangalorean and I'm in a long-distance relationship with a girl who is a Christian, and I'm a Hindu (28F & 29M). My parents are dead against us being together and getting married. We are at the stage in life where we want to get married. My mom called 2 people home from Akhila Karnataka Brahmana Mahasabha, with the goal of making me break up with her. She told me that they told her they can’t do that, but they’ll tell me all the implications of an intercaste/inter-religion marriage. They came home last Sunday, introduced themselves, and did not mention “Akhila Karnataka Brahmana Mahasabha” even once. They did mention where they’re from, though, and it was another name… It was RSS.

They told me Hindustan is “Hindu ka sthan” - the place for Hindus. They said the nation comes first. Apart from this propaganda BS, they were nice. They simply spoke about stuff… I guess…and in about 20 minutes after having coffee, they left.

I have been unable to sleep for the following week. I feel tortured. My mom constantly asks me why I don’t break up. Telling me bullshit about how it can never work between my girlfriend and me. I’m on edge all the time and unable to focus on anything. It’s so exhausting. It’s TORTURE. In the full sense of the word. Most important of all… My girlfriend is FRIGHTENED… She’s questioning whether it’s worth it to be with me. And I can’t possibly blame her. She’s so right. This is a line that no parent in their right mind should ever cross. I feel my girlfriend's life, her work, her family, her everything has been endangered by this. In both our opinions, actually. And I feel horrible about myself. She didn’t sign up for this. Nobody does. Her safety is my responsibility, and no matter how seemingly harmless this particular interaction might have been, I know I have failed. I have no right to convince her to save the relationship with me right now. We are deeply in love, but that is not the priority right now. Even if she breaks up with me, I need to ensure her safety.

I have concluded that I have to bring the house down tonight. (A metaphor for having a talk with my parents, confronting them about how messed up this is, how deranged and drastic this step they took is, and how it’s a line that they can’t uncross.) There’s obviously almost 3 full years of abuse and history (specific to my relationship) that I have weathered till now in the hopes of convincing them in the end (and can’t cover in just this post), so that I can finally give my woman, in-laws that are supportive and loving and genuinely happy when they see how we get along and flourish together as a couple that cares for each other. I want to conclude, though, that they are too extreme for this to possibly pan out in the idealistic way that I’ve been picturing. I’m finding it hard to come to grips with the fact that we both have been resilient in this relationship despite my parents being against it, for absolutely nothing. But I know it needs to be done. The hammer needs to be dropped. I need to abandon my parents' home. And it needs to be done now.

  
I want your opinions on:

1. What are the immediate steps I need to take to ensure safety for my woman? (Legal action, steps I need to take, anything really. This is of utmost priority.)  
2. Are there specific things I need to say, or is there a specific (Most effective tactic available) way to bring said hammer down on my parents? (I’m new to talking to my parents in such a drastic black/white way. I know. I’m ashamed of it too.)  
3. Are there specific things I need to remember not to do during the confrontation? (I plan to voice record it as proof as well. Don’t know how or why it may come in handy later, but yeah.)  
4. How can I prevent my parents from coming to my workplace after I drop said hammer on them?",5,1771585892.0,RelationshipIndia,3,0.86,False

Here’s the situation.

When we first moved in together the apartment was completely unfurnished. She said she’d buy a couch, coffee table, and TV stand for the living room and I could just pay her back half later. I never actually agreed to this arrangement, she just went ahead and bought everything without discussing prices or asking if I even wanted to split it.

The furniture she bought was way more expensive than I would’ve chosen. She spent CA$1,200 total on stuff I would’ve gotten for maybe CA$400 if I’d had any input. Now she’s saying I owe her CA$600 because I “used it for a year” and it’s only fair I pay half.

I told her I’m not paying because I never agreed to buy furniture with her and she made all those decisions unilaterally. She’s furious and says I’m a freeloader who took advantage of her generosity. She even mentioned the furniture store had some deal where you get CA$15 off every CA$150 spent and she could’ve saved money if I’d gone shopping with her which somehow makes this my fault.

I looked up the furniture afterwards and found nearly identical pieces on alibaba being sold to retailers for a fraction of what she paid so she clearly overspent on stuff that wasn’t even that nice.

1r9seq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1r9seq1/the_psychology_of_flirting_science_based_tricks/,The Psychology of Flirting Science Based Tricks That Actually Work with Women,"so i've been diving deep into the psychology of attraction lately (books, research papers, actual field studies, not just reddit hot takes) and holy shit, the gap between what we think works and what actually works is massive.

most guys approach flirting like they're following some pickup artist script from 2009. they think it's about the perfect opener or some manipulative ""technique"" that forces attraction. but after going through work from people like Esther Perel, reading way too much evolutionary psychology research, and honestly just paying attention to what creates chemistry in real life, turns out flirting is less about what you say and more about the psychological environment you create.

the problem isn't that you're not smooth enough. it's that most people fundamentally misunderstand what flirting even is. society sells us this idea that attraction follows logical steps, that there's a formula. but attraction is messy, it's neurochemical, it's about creating specific emotional states that bypass our rational brain entirely.

**the mirroring effect is your secret weapon.** this comes straight from neuroscience research on rapport building. when you subtly mirror someone's body language, speech patterns, even their energy level, you're activating their mirror neurons and creating an unconscious sense of familiarity. not like some creepy parrot, but if she leans in, you lean in a few seconds later. if she's speaking softly, you match that energy. Dr. Tanya Chartrand's research at Duke showed that people who were mimicked rated their interactions as smoother and more pleasant, and here's the kicker, they didn't consciously notice the mimicking. your brain just registers ""this person gets me"" on a subconscious level. I started doing this naturally after reading about it and the difference in how conversations flow is actually insane. women seem more comfortable, more engaged, like we've known each other longer than we have.

**push-pull creates tension and that's where attraction lives.** this is something I learned from reading ""Models"" by Mark Manson (legitimately one of the best books on authentic attraction, not that garbage manipulation stuff). the basic idea is you alternate between showing interest and creating space. you compliment her taste in music, then you playfully challenge her opinion on something. you maintain eye contact and smile, then you look away and give her room to chase. it's not about playing games, it's about creating the psychological dynamic that makes someone lean forward. Esther Perel talks about this in ""Mating in Captivity"", how desire needs space to exist, how too much closeness actually kills attraction. when you're constantly available, constantly validating, constantly chasing, there's no room for her to wonder about you, to feel that pull. the push-pull mimics the natural rhythm of how attraction builds. it's literally how our brains are wired to respond to uncertainty and reward.

**you need to pass the ""can i bring you to brunch"" test.** this concept comes from Matthew Hussey's work and it's brutally simple. can she imagine introducing you to her friends without cringing? because flirting isn't just about creating attraction between two people, it's about presenting yourself as someone who fits into her social world. this means having conversational range beyond just hitting on her. being able to talk about things that matter to her, showing that you have your own life and interests, being socially aware.

if you want to go deeper on this stuff without having to read through dozens of books and research papers, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been genuinely useful. it pulls from sources like the ones mentioned here, dating psychology research, expert interviews, and turns them into personalized audio content. you can type in something specific like ""i'm an introverted guy who wants to learn how to be naturally magnetic with women"" and it builds a learning plan just for that, pulling relevant insights from relationship experts and behavioral science.

the depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 15 minute overview or go deep for 40 minutes with real examples and context. plus you can pick different voices, including this weirdly addictive sarcastic one that makes the content way more engaging than just reading. it's basically taken all those books on my list and made them actually digestible for when i'm commuting or at the gym.

**the vulnerability paradox will change everything.** Brene Brown's research showed that vulnerability isn't weakness, it's actually the birthplace of connection and intimacy. but here's what guys get wrong, they think vulnerability means trauma dumping or being needy. real vulnerability in flirting is admitting when you're nervous, saying ""honestly I just wanted an excuse to talk to you"", sharing an actual opinion instead of just agreeing with everything she says. it's being willing to risk rejection by being genuine. I remember reading ""Daring Greatly"" and having this moment of oh fuck, I've been hiding behind this performance of confidence instead of just being a real person. when you're vulnerable in the right way, you're essentially saying ""I trust you enough to show you something real"" and that creates intimacy faster than any scripted line ever could. it also filters out people who aren't right for you anyway.

**playful teasing activates reward circuits like nothing else.** there's actual neuroscience behind why gentle teasing works. Dr. Helen Fisher's research on romantic love showed that uncertainty and novelty trigger dopamine release, the same neurotransmitter associated with reward and motivation. when you playfully tease someone, you're creating micro moments of uncertainty followed by resolution, and that dopamine hit feels good. but it has to be done right. you're teasing her about something trivial and non threatening, like her obsession with iced coffee in winter or her very strong opinions about which way toilet paper should hang. you're not attacking insecurities, you're noticing quirks and finding them endearing. it signals confidence because you're not putting her on a pedestal, you're treating her like a person you're already comfortable with. and it creates an ""us versus the world"" dynamic where you're both in on the joke.

**here's the thing nobody wants to hear.** flirting is a skill and skills require practice and yeah, failure. you can read every book, understand every psychological principle, but if you're not actually putting yourself in situations where you're talking to women and calibrating based on responses, none of it matters. the goal isn't to manipulate anyone into liking you. the goal is to become someone who creates the conditions where genuine attraction can develop. someone who's comfortable enough with themselves to be playful, vulnerable, present. someone who understands that chemistry isn't something you force, it's something you allow space for.

most people overthink this stuff into paralysis. they wait for the perfect moment, the perfect thing to say. but the psychological research is clear, action comes before motivation, not the other way around. you start doing the thing, then your brain catches up and makes it feel natural. so yeah, learn the principles, but then just go talk to people. be interested in them. notice what works and what doesn't. adjust. repeat. that's literally how everyone who's good at this got good at it.",1,1771585278.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

I saw this really friendly feral cat by my wife's place the other day. I was hoping someone would take her in. She's very sweet and let's people pet her without issues. Unfortunately, I can't take any more cats in otherwise I would have adopted her.

I had applied for an Intel Analyst role with a federal agency and made it through a phone interview. I'm hoping I get called for the onsite interview soon. It looks like a role I would be good at since I have experience with their tech stack. However, it's really hard to get in with the hiring freezes in the federal government and the competitiveness these days. 

Fingers crossed though.

Hope you all have a great Friday.

1r9saof,https://www.reddit.com/r/altontowers/comments/1r9saof/what_a_horrendous_event/,What a horrendous event.,"So I will preface this by saying i know this event is not for me. It is not for a single adult but i suppose this also allowed me to look from a different perspective.

Honestly this Pirate Takeover event is horrendous. Either Towers seriously underestimated the popularity of the event or did not care? Having a ride advertised (Spinball Whizzer) but not operating at all is pure negligence - you may argue ""well it cannot operate at low temperature or in the rain"" to which i would say ""what do you expect the conditions to be in February in the UK?"".

Admittedly I went down to Towers just to have a look. I have free time and its not far. I expected it to be buzzing full of kids excitement and young uns enjoying the park. I arrived at the Car Park and all the kids around me were excited - ""this is gonna be the best day ever"" and ""im so excited"" were overheard so i was quietly confident.  
That is until i got on to the park.

Parents and buggies everywhere! Queues, queues, queues.   
It was Thursday it was wet and there was a threat of snow. But it was busy, so busy. Normally i'd say this was a reason to celebrate. Clearly people were interested in the event, clearly children were excited. Except that there just wasnt a lot to do! And not a lot of space.

Ok so people knew the ride/activity line up ahead of time. Spinball was closed however as it appears to have been all event, which puts pressure on the other parts of the line up. The Treasure Hunt map actors were snowed with kids and parents grabbing at them for the map, the stages for the hunt were busy and large queues formed. Whilst I walked straight in to Sharkbait Reef (I understand at times theres been big queues?) the inside was chock full of people and viewing space at any exhibit was limited.   
The rides were similarly bust 45 minutes for Heave-ho, 25 minutes for the barrel ride. I looked around CBeebies and didnt clock the wait times on the ride but there was plenty of people waiting for them!

Food was so expensive, not really a surprise, but i'd have hoped if catering to families and children there might have been something affordable - the cheapest item on the menus i could find were ""chips"" at £5. Can you imagine as a family of four spending £20 on chips? Heaven forbid you want more!I I had chips and Goujons for just shy of £15 and whilst they were nice thats all i can say about them.

The entertainment and actors around the park were clearly trying hard. There was a guy near to the arcade in Mutiny Bay doing a dance skit and he was very enthusiastic, he had a crowd and had them dancing. This was good to see! I'd love more of this for the actual season.

Something happened though on park, that is out of Towers control, but really soured my thoughts on the day and was typical entitled people.   
Corner Coffee was a disaster all day. Order you drink and expect to wait 30-40 minutes for it to be served. I grabbed a coffee and waited in the shop. They were calling drinks 50 numbers below my drink order number. Towers must have underestimated a parents desire for caffeine after a car ride with kids. I dont think there was anywhere else that sold coffee too. This led though to entitled guest experience - A woman with a stick came to the drink counter rather than use the electric kiosk. She spoke to the staff like they were a piece of.... She was saying ""I cannot stand for long so you need to take my order because I cannot wait"" she was directed to the kiosks. She clearly placed her order and then stomped over to the counter again demanding they make her drink straight away becuase ""I cannot wait"". I said to her theres a whole shop here of people who dont want to wait, theres toddlers who cannot wait but they are. She waved her stick ""I use this stick, I'm disabled"" and stomped away to have a rant at her poor husband! I cannot fault the staff at the coffee shop they seemed to be as quick as they could be but waiting 40 minutes for your Costa is unbelievable.

In my opinion this could have been a great event, clearly there was a demand as the place was full, as i said on a wet cold Thursday in February where surrounding areas had been experiencing snow. They had events that was popular (hence the queue for the treasure hunt). The actors I saw were entertaining and held the crowds. But everything around that was just half cocked and disappointing.   
I hope the kids I saw around had a great day but I cant help think they were in the queue crying.

I reviewed my day as asked for by Towers on the app and website with these exact thoughts. Who knows maybe future February events will improve? Probably not?",13,1771584895.0,altontowers,12,0.84,False

League: Team Finland vs Team Canada (9:40AM CST on PeacockTV)

**Recap**: I frickin' HATE the NBA wit a passion! ALL MY BAD BEATS are in this frickin' sport! Cavs scored 70 points at HT and scored 100 points wit 3 mins left in the 3rd quarter! And they only had 104 midway in the 4th quarter! WTF?! Just insane. I saw it coming! Tons of turnovers and missed FGA, I hedged a couple times, but I should have hedged more! I hedged at U 129.5 twice and had to find another way to hedge, so I took the Nets +29.5 Idk what to say.. this sport hates me and I hate it more! Not going to handicap this sport for a while, prolly go super light.

**Matchup:** So glad Hot key is back but so is MLB (well.. spring training). I'm taking Sox ML tomorrow, you all kno why! I'm also taking Connor McJesus to score a goal! Look.. I kno he didn't score a goal, but the man had 7 SOG on his last game and he is averaging 5+ SOG per game in the Olympics. In a big game like this I have to say that one of those SOG is going to be a goal for Team Canada. I also like Nathan MacKinnon to score too, so there you guys go! I gave y'all three plus money for today's slate!

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Connor McDavid Goalscorer. McJesus scores the first goal of the game!!!

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

My parents are dead against us being together and getting married. We are at the stage in life where we want to get married. My mom called 2 people home from Akhila Karnataka Brahmana Mahasabha, with the goal of making me break up with her. She told me that they told her they can’t do that, but they’ll tell me all the implications of an intercaste/inter-religion marriage. They came home last Sunday, introduced themselves, and did not mention “Akhila Karnataka Brahmana Mahasabha” even once. They did mention where they’re from, though, and it was another name… It was RSS.

They told me Hindustan is “Hindu ka sthan” - the place for Hindus. They said the nation comes first. Apart from this propaganda BS, they were nice. They simply spoke about stuff… I guess…and in about 20 minutes after having coffee, they left.

I have been unable to sleep for the following week. I feel tortured. My mom constantly asks me why I don’t break up. Telling me bullshit about how it can never work between my girlfriend and me. I’m on edge all the time and unable to focus on anything. It’s so exhausting. It’s TORTURE. In the full sense of the word. Most important of all… My girlfriend is FRIGHTENED… She’s questioning whether it’s worth it to be with me. And I can’t possibly blame her. She’s so right. This is a line that no parent in their right mind should ever cross. I feel my girlfriend's life, her work, her family, her everything has been endangered by this. In both our opinions, actually. And I feel horrible about myself. She didn’t sign up for this. Nobody does. Her safety is my responsibility, and no matter how seemingly harmless this particular interaction might have been, I know I have failed. I have no right to convince her to save the relationship with me right now. We are deeply in love, but that is not the priority right now. Even if she breaks up with me, I need to ensure her safety.

I have concluded that I have to bring the house down tonight. (A metaphor for having a talk with my parents, confronting them about how messed up this is, how deranged and drastic this step they took is, and how it’s a line that they can’t uncross.) There’s obviously almost 3 full years of abuse and history (specific to my relationship) that I have weathered till now in the hopes of convincing them in the end (and can’t cover in just this post), so that I can finally give my woman, in-laws that are supportive and loving and genuinely happy when they see how we get along and flourish together as a couple that cares for each other. I want to conclude, though, that they are too extreme for this to possibly pan out in the idealistic way that I’ve been picturing. I’m finding it hard to come to grips with the fact that we both have been resilient in this relationship despite my parents being against it, for absolutely nothing. But I know it needs to be done. The hammer needs to be dropped. I need to abandon my parents' home. And it needs to be done now.

I want your opinions on:

1. What are the immediate steps I need to take to ensure safety for my woman? (Legal action, steps I need to take, anything really. This is of utmost priority.)
2. Are there specific things I need to say, or is there a specific (Most effective tactic available) way to bring said hammer down on my parents? (I’m new to talking to my parents in such a drastic black/white way. I know. I’m ashamed of it too.)
3. Are there specific things I need to remember not to do during the confrontation? (I plan to voice record it as proof as well. Don’t know how or why it may come in handy later, but yeah.)
4. How can I prevent my parents from coming to my workplace after I drop said hammer on them?",72,1771584395.0,india,26,0.88,False
1r9s5ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1r9s5ae/am_i_crazy_for_thinking_my_husband_is_clearly/,Am I crazy for thinking my husband is clearly hiding something?,"I feel like I’m going crazy and need some advice. My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 5. We have had A LOT of problems throughout the years and probably should never have gotten married but we had a child and long story short I’ve been trying everything to keep us together since.

When we first got together 10 years ago I just added him onto my current bank account and we have shared this account ever since. I pay all the bills and handle all the household budgeting. We had never had any issues regarding money. Last January, I thought we were really done for good that time. For the first time in 10 years, my husband went and opened up his own account with a different bank and set up his work direct deposit this account. We decided to stay together so instead of changing his direct deposit again we decided just to keep that account and he would withdraw his check and put it in our shared account. His checks have always at least been $1400, the most being about $1500. So he deposits the $1400 in our account and we discussed that any extra would go towards his lunches, snacks, coffees, or whatever else he wants. Mind you, I’ve always been under the assumption that he’s about $100 or less for the two weeks between checks. He also uses our shared account when he has “run out” of funds for lunch, phone games, snacks, etc. I’ve never complained about this or said anything because I  just assume he has ran out of his funds. 

So after his check last week, he had went and got our daughter some Valentines things totaling about $50 is my guess. I thought wow he must have set aside some of his lunch money and was happily surprised. Well today, I received an email with a receipt showing he had spent $200 on his card. I was really confused on how he had so much money. I mean he frequently talks about the lunches he goes and eats, things he buys for his phone games, etc. so it seemed really odd. I called to ask him about it and told him I would like to look at the account when he got home. He said okay. 

Well he gets home and what do you know. He now refuses to show me anything. He says it’s none of my business and that he would rather end our relationship than show me the account. He says most of his paycheck goes to the family so why does it matter. I work 40 hours a week and my full check gets direct deposited in our shared account. I am bewildered by this and just so confused and hurt. I feel like I can’t trust him and what is a relationship without trust. He must be hiding something big to not show me, right? He denies “hiding” anything at all. But he is flat out refusing to show me. 

My Advice Request- Am I wrong? 

Please any advice is welcome. I need to hear some other perspectives! I feel like I’m going crazy. 

TL;DR- My husband is refusing to show me his separate bank account, even though we have a shared account in which my full paycheck is deposited. He says it’s not my business and not hiding anything. Am I crazy to think he definitely is? ",2,1771584359.0,marriageadvice,6,1.0,False

Surprisingly, my monthly expenses here are pretty low and I still eat out once a day. Here are the practical ways I save money. In 2026!

# Haircuts

In Warsaw, you’ll see salons charging 160 PLN or even 80 PLN for a haircut, but that’s still expensive. The normal cheap price is 35 PLN for men, 45 PLN for women.

Search Google Maps for “**Express Fryzjer**” — many are run by Vietnamese people. Men 35 PLN, women 45 PLN. There’s one at **Metro Centrum**.

After trying twice, I found their style didn’t match my taste. Now I go to another chain called “**TOP FRYZJER**” (also in the underground passage at **Metro Centrum**). Same prices: men 35 PLN, women 45 PLN. Cash only, no English spoken (Polish only). Easy trick: Show them a photo of your hairstyle and say “Can you cut it like this?” They do a similar job. (Pictures at the end)

# Eating Out Cheaply

Cooking at home is cheaper than in many countries, but for eating out: Go to **Vietnamese** places. They’re everywhere in Warsaw, and in 2026 you can still get meals for 25–30 PLN.

Popular dishes (every shop has them):

“**Kurczak chrupiący**” (crispy chicken with rice) — 23 PLN

“**Ryż smażony wieprzowiną**” (fried rice with pork) — 25 PLN  
(Pictures at the end)

Portions in Polish Vietnamese shops are huge — they adapted to local tastes (*small portions aren’t accepted here*). You often get 3 big pieces of chicken or fish. In Czech Republic, the same Vietnamese shops give much smaller amounts.

# Useful Shopping Apps

**Żabka app**: Great for discounts on hot dogs, coffee, etc. It worth to use it.

**McDonald’s app**: Points build up fast — easy to get free meals next time.

If you know other good (worth using) apps, please let me know!

# Mobile Data / Internet

In places like the UK, Ireland, France, or Germany, people avoid using mobile data because it’s expensive or limited —I call them ‘WiFi beggars.’ In Poland, it’s different: real mobile freedom.

For 35 PLN/month, you get 75 GB from almost any provider.

I tried traditional **Orange**, but the app was all in Polish and payments were annoying. Switched to **Orange Flex** — super friendly for foreigners. I’ve used it for 2 years and love it. Unused data rolls over (no waste). They often have promos for extra GB.

Sign-up bonus: Use the code **TAIU9JW** to register, you will get 30 PLN extra credit.

# Clothes (Especially Winter)

Winter in Poland is tough. For discounts, go to **Factory Annopol** outlet near **Metro Bródno** station. Lots of good deals. I got a super warm “armor-level” jacket at **Mountain Warehouse** there. Other outlets I checked had fewer options. (Pictures at the end)

# Getting Sick

For minor illnesses, just go to a pharmacy (Apteka), describe your symptoms — the pharmacist gives you medicine. Much cheaper than seeing a doctor.

If you need an official sick leave (**L4**), and you have NFZ insurance, use **DokDok** platform. No video call needed — just text chat with a doctor (they can speak English while texting). Get your sick note online.

# Accommodation — The Biggest Saving

This is where you save the most money every month.

Normal market price: A single room in a shared flat (shared kitchen + bathroom) is around **1500 PLN/month** in 2026. You won’t find lower anyway.

But Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika) has 10 dorms across the city.

For their own students: 400 PLN/month.

For foreigners/non-students (any visa/status): Double price = 800 PLN/month for a 2-person room.

It’s open to non-students!

Hostels are cheaper per night (50 PLN), but for long-term, around 900 PLN/month in a 6-person room — if you can handle it.

Accommodation is your biggest monthly expense. Save money here first, then you can spend more freely on other things.
