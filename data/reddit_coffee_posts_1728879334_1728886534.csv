1g39h7j,https://i.redd.it/0ynf2lwdynud1.jpeg,AITA: guy stood me up and said i’m to blame ,"Sorry if this is a little over the place. Kind of a long read.

Context: 

Me and him used to have a pretty long history. We used to like each other but then it got super toxic and only sexual. I lost feelings and wanted to move on. We stopped talking a month ago and I had him blocked. Weeks later, he randomly messages off a new number and we start talking again on snap. He says he misses me, wants me, all that BS. And it sounded genuine. Like he truly missed ME, not just my body. I sort of softened and thought maybe he’s changed. We agreed to hang out but he wasn’t rly taking any initiative to plan it which confused me since he kept telling me how much he missed me. He started to take forever to respond and his messages became dry.

We finally agreed to meet up today at a coffee shop at 4 pm. He didn’t text me at all this morning to confirm or to check in (which he said he would) so I ended up texting him around 2 pm to confirm. I asked if we could meet at 5 pm instead cuz I was finishing up an assignment that I’d been working on since early morning. 

His response was really rude. He said no and that I shouldn’t waste his time and kept asking if I was coming at 4pm or not. I told him that I was coming but that I’d be ready by 5pm. 

I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since we were only meeting at a coffee shop then possibly going back to his place to watch a movie. He then said he wanted me over at 4 pm before his parents came home, which I did NOT know about. I even asked him the night before if today was a good day to meet (since it’s thanksgiving the next day) and he assured me that it was fine. 

Anyway, we argue a little abt that and he ends up saying it’s still okay to meet up and to leave as soon as I can. At this point im rushing to finish my hair and makeup. I did feel bad for being late and I would’ve gotten ready earlier but I wasn’t certain if our plan was still happening or not since he hadn’t texted or said anything this morning. He was also barely communicating w me this past week. 

Now this is when all goes to shit. I finished getting ready and as i was about to leave he randomly tells me that he only wants to meet to smash. I got upset and stopped responding. I was already dressed up and didn’t know what to do w myself. I did have a feeling he was gonna make a move on me at his place but I didn’t think that was the SOLE reason he wanted to see me. Maybe I would’ve been fine w it if he’d been more respectful. 

He ends up saying he’s joking and to leave soon. I tell him I don’t wanna go over to his place anymore and that im okay w just hanging out at the coffee shop. I was super uncomfortable but still wanted to see him (idek why). He then proceeded to tell me to stay home because it was too late to hang out and that we can hangout tomorrow (on thanksgiving when his family is over???). At that point I got really upset. I spent 2.5 hours (2:30 pm to 5 pm) getting ready and was updating him the whole time. I put a lot of effort into my makeup and used all my high end products. 

Our entire conversation happened on snap btw and I ended up blocking him on it after our argument so I can’t show it unfortunately. He was blaming me for cancelling and I was fed up. 

I felt like an idiot after for thinking that he liked me for more than just my body. I admit I cried. I ended up going out by myself and getting a hot chocolate at a cafe bc I didn’t want my makeup and hair to go to waste

I’m sick and tired. I was doing fine before he reached out again. It’s like he purposely did all of this just to torture me. 

I just want to forget about him. AITA?",1,1728886225.0,texts,1,1.0,False

Kind of a weird question. We come from a very religious family. My sister has been dating this guy for about a year. I trust him, he’s a good guy, and I know they’re careful.

My sister is living with our parents while she finishes college. Lately my mom has been more strict about the time her boyfriend leaves and the time they spend together alone in the house. They’ve been having trouble finding time to do their thing.

So my sister texted me today and asked me if they could use my apartment a couple times a week for a couple hours. I personally don’t have any problems. I can just grab a book and go to a coffee shop. It’s annoying to have to wash so many sheets, but I can understand it can be hard at that age to find a good place and time. I told her it’s fine as long as they don’t go over 2 hours.

What is ProDentim?

# [Visit Official Website To Get Exclusives Discount Offer: Click Her](https://shorturl.at/8QlY7)

ProDentim is a dietary supplement designed to enhance oral health through the use of probiotics and natural ingredients. Formulated as easy-to-chew tablets, ProDentim aims to support healthy gums and teeth, restore the oral microbiome, and improve overall dental hygiene. The inclusion of ingredients like inulin, peppermint, and various probiotic strains helps ensure a balanced and healthy oral environment, reducing issues like bad breath, inflammation, and plaque buildup.

Creator of ProDentim

ProDentim was developed by a team of health experts and researchers committed to improving oral health through natural means. The formulation is based on extensive scientific research and clinical studies, ensuring that each ingredient is included for its proven benefits. Manufactured in FDA-compliant and GMP-certified facilities, ProDentim adheres to the highest standards of quality and safety, offering consumers a reliable and effective solution for their dental health needs.

Science Behind The Working Of ProDentim

The science behind ProDentim lies in its blend of probiotics and natural ingredients that work together to support oral health. The probiotics in ProDentim help restore a balanced oral microbiome, reducing harmful bacteria and promoting beneficial ones. Ingredients like inulin and malic acid enhance this process by feeding good bacteria and maintaining an optimal pH balance in the mouth. The combined action of these ingredients helps reduce inflammation, prevent cavities, and support overall dental hygiene.

# [Visit Official Website To Get Exclusives Discount Offer: Click Her](https://shorturl.at/8QlY7)

How Does ProDentim Work?

**Restoring Oral Microbiome Balance**

ProDentim works primarily by restoring the balance of the oral microbiome. The mouth is home to a diverse community of bacteria, both beneficial and harmful. An imbalance, often caused by poor diet, stress, or the use of harsh dental products, can lead to dental problems such as cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. ProDentim introduces 3.5 billion CFUs of beneficial probiotics to repopulate the mouth with good bacteria. These probiotics outcompete harmful bacteria, reducing their numbers and preventing them from causing dental issues.

**Enhancing Oral Hygiene**

ProDentim enhances oral hygiene through its formulation of natural ingredients. Ingredients like peppermint and malic acid help to clean the mouth and maintain fresh breath. Peppermint has natural antimicrobial properties that reduce the presence of odor-causing bacteria, while malic acid helps to remove surface stains from teeth. This combination not only ensures cleaner teeth but also a fresher and healthier mouth environment.

**Supporting Overall Health**

Beyond oral health, ProDentim supports overall health by enhancing the body immune response and improving digestion. The probiotics in ProDentim, such as Lactobacillus reuteri and B. lactis BL-04, are known to boost the immune system and support gut health. A balanced gut microbiome is crucial for nutrient absorption and overall well-being. By improving both oral and gut health, ProDentim contributes to a holistic approach to wellness.

What are the Ingredients in ProDentim?

**Inulin**

Inulin is a type of prebiotic fiber that serves as food for beneficial bacteria in the gut and mouth. It promotes the growth of good bacteria, helping to maintain a healthy balance. Inulin also aids in digestion and helps regulate blood sugar levels.

# [Visit Official Website To Get Exclusives Discount Offer: Click Her](https://shorturl.at/8QlY7)

**Peppermint**

Peppermint is included for its natural antimicrobial and refreshing properties. The essential oils in peppermint, particularly menthol, help reduce bad breath and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Peppermint also stimulates saliva production, which is crucial for maintaining oral hygiene.

**Malic Acid**

Malic acid is a naturally occurring organic acid found in fruits like apples. It helps maintain an optimal pH balance in the mouth, which is essential for preventing the growth of harmful bacteria. Malic acid also helps whiten teeth by removing surface stains.

**Tricalcium Phosphate**

Tricalcium phosphate is a calcium compound that helps to remineralize tooth enamel. It strengthens teeth and makes them more resistant to decay. This ingredient also supports overall dental health by providing essential minerals.

**Lactobacillus reuteri**

Lactobacillus reuteri is a probiotic strain known for its ability to enhance oral and gut health. It helps reduce inflammation in the mouth and supports gum health. This probiotic also produces antimicrobial substances that inhibit harmful bacteria.

**B. lactis BL-04**

B. lactis BL-04 is another probiotic strain that helps maintain a healthy oral microbiome. It produces short-chain fatty acids that lower the pH of the mouth, making it inhospitable for harmful bacteria. This strain also boosts the immune system.

**Lactobacillus paracasei**

Lactobacillus paracasei produces bacteriocins, which are antimicrobial peptides that target harmful bacteria. This probiotic strain helps maintain a healthy balance of microorganisms in the mouth and supports overall oral hygiene.

**Reduces Bad Breath**

**Enhances Oral Hygiene**

ProDentim enhances oral hygiene by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting harmful ones. Ingredients like inulin and malic acid help clean the mouth, reduce plaque buildup, and maintain a healthy pH balance.

**Improves Respiratory Health**

ProDentim supports respiratory health by maintaining a healthy oral microbiome, which reduces the risk of bacteria migrating to the respiratory tract. This helps prevent respiratory infections and supports overall respiratory function.

**Boosts Immune System**

The probiotics in ProDentim, such as Lactobacillus reuteri and B. lactis BL-04, help boost the immune system. A strong immune system is crucial for preventing infections and maintaining overall health.

**Whitens Teeth**

Malic acid in ProDentim helps remove surface stains from teeth, leading to a whiter, brighter smile. This natural teeth-whitening effect is a significant benefit for those seeking to improve their dental aesthetics.

**Supports Digestive Health**

The probiotics and prebiotics in ProDentim also support digestive health by promoting a balanced gut microbiome. This helps improve digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall gastrointestinal function, contributing to overall well-being.

How To Use ProDentim Effectively

To use ProDentim effectively, chew one tablet daily in the morning. Ensure you chew it thoroughly to allow the active ingredients to be absorbed efficiently in the mouth. Consistent daily use is key to achieving optimal results. Additionally, maintaining regular oral hygiene practices, such as brushing and flossing, will complement the benefits of ProDentim.

Possible Side Effects of ProDentim

ProDentim is generally well-tolerated, but some users might experience mild side effects such as digestive discomfort, including gas or bloating, especially during the initial days of use. These side effects are typically temporary and subside as your body adjusts to the probiotics. If symptoms persist, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional.

I'm looking at some of the 12v heated lunch boxes available online. Does anyone have any experience using these or have any recommendations? I don't need anything too fancy but don't mind buying a product that will work good even if it's a bit expensive.

I have a small solar generator which doesn't have enough juice to really use for cooking which I could upgrade but to run a microwave it's impractical for my vehicle and sun exposure.

I charge things at work which makes things easy as well, also my vehicle has a built in 120v factory inverter but it isn't enough to run a cheap coffee pot so it's out of the question.

Mainly I just want to be able to heat things up, frozen dinners, premade grocery store refrigerated plates, basically anything that will fit. I'm not expecting these things to cook anything, just heat them up though that'd be nice.

It needs to be big enough to fit frozen dinners at least and I don't mind letting them thaw for a bit before I heat them up either. Thanks in advance.",3,1728885326.0,urbancarliving,0,1.0,False

1. **Why Go Stereo?** 🤩
   - It’s super trendy and adds depth to your sound, thanks to those fancy digital pedals that make everything sound as cool as a hipster coffee shop vibe. ☕️
   - Your guitar tone splits between two amps — kind of like having two friends arguing about who makes the best music! 🎶

2. **Two Routes:** Analog vs. Digital 🛣️
   - **Analog**: Use an ABY pedal to link two amps — just like the best tag team wrestling duo! 🤼‍♂️
   - **Digital**: Easier to set up, especially with pedals equipped with stereo outputs. Technology, amirite? 😎

3. **Benefits of Stereo:** 🎉
   - Get to amplify and EQ each side differently — it’s like having a custom sandwich without the carbs! 🥪
   - You’ll experience modulation effects that sound way cooler in stereo — think reverb and delay spreading across the stage like a pizza at a party! 🍕

4. **Wattage Matters!** ⚡️
   - Keep the headroom in mind! You don’t want your high-powered 100W amp yelling at your low-key 1W amp during a solo. Plan your wattage buddies wisely! 

5. **Dual Amp/Single Cab?** 🤔
   - Use two amps for a richer tone! You can pair different types or go for identical ones to avoid ground mouse traps! 🐭🔌 
   - Use effects differently on each amp for wild textures — you could even split your clean and dirty sounds like a true rockstar! 🎸

6. **Common Setups:** 🚀
   - **Wet/Wet**: Both amps rocking the effects for that full shower of sound! 💦
   - **Wet/Dry**: Keep one amp clean while the other bathes in effects — it’s like a spa day for your guitar! 🧖‍♂️
   - **Wet/Dry/Wet**: For the overachievers! Surround yourself with sweet effects on both sides while keeping the center clean! 🎤

Now you’re all set to dive into the world of stereo guitar amps! Don’t be lazy and lug ‘em around! More amps mean more fun — because just like pizza, more is better! 🍕🎶 Now, get out there and rock! 🤘

1g398l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OP1users/comments/1g398l3/i_love_it/,I love it! ,"This is just a love rant, but I've seen a couple posts recently about how people weren't finding inspiration with the OP-1, so maybe it's needed. 

I bought a used OG OP-1 about a month ago, having wanting one for years but telling myself no, I shouldn't spend that much money on gear as music is just a hobby for me... I've finished a track a week, which I don't think I've ever done for a month. Worth every penny. 

It's a complete music-making kit in a tiny box. It's perfect for plane rides, trains, taxis, couch sessions, coffee shops, anything. It means more music in my life, but it's more than that. I tried the circuit tracks and though I had fun with it, I felt restricted by the sounds and frustrated by short patterns. The finger sequencer in the OP-1 let's you play with patterns but combine them much more intuitively to make fills. I could've put that money towards an OP-1 years earlier. The OP-1 sounds are SO good, and you're inspired to use both sequencer and record to tape.

The workflow is incredible, and every restriction I heard about in all my researching before pulling the trigger turns out to be an advantage. One tape forces me to focus on the track i'm making, and 4 tracks keeps me from saving less-than-perfect ideas for later and cluttering the whole thing up. No ""undo"" makes you think before you record, and practice, and honestly.... you can still undo if you use lift properly. No stereo gives me a reason to put it into ableton after and polish it, but it keeps all the mouse clicking to a minimum. The constant moving around in tape makes me consider the song structure more often, instead of just getting stuck in a loop.

All the gear I've bought since doing my toes into the electronic music world of DAWs, synths, FX, and grooveboxes years ago has been chasing this. I don't kid myself, I know it's really just a toy, but it is quite the toy!! I know I'll get used to it but I hope this little beast will continue to inspire.

Also, unparalleled visual feedback, toy-like synthesizers and FX to play with, and sampling from the FM radio or mic 👍👍

I always thought those urban legends about haunted mirrors were nonsense—until last night. If you’re reading this whatever you do, don’t look too long at your reflection after dark.

I was up late working. My job’s been hectic lately, and deadlines have been breathing down my neck. It was around 1:30 AM when I finally shut my laptop. My eyes were burning, my head throbbing. I figured I needed to wash up and get to bed.

My apartment’s small, so the bathroom is just a few steps away from my desk. I flipped on the light and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would help me feel less like a zombie. As I glanced up into the mirror, something felt off. I can’t explain it, but it was like my reflection wasn’t quite right.

It’s hard to describe. Everything looked normal—same tired eyes, same messy hair—but the expression was wrong. It wasn’t mirroring my exhaustion; it was… watching me. Studying me.

I shook it off, telling myself I was just overtired. But as I turned away to grab my towel, I saw movement from the corner of my eye. My reflection hadn’t turned. It was still staring straight at me.

I froze, my heart hammering against my chest. Slowly, I looked back. My reflection was grinning—a wide, unnatural smile that stretched too far. My lips weren’t moving, but his were.

I don’t know what possessed me, but I whispered, “What do you want?”

The grin widened, and I swear, I saw his eyes darken. The lights above me flickered, and for a split second, the bathroom felt like it dropped ten degrees. I wanted to run, but I couldn’t look away.

His mouth moved, forming words I couldn’t hear. But then, as if he was reading my mind, I felt the words creep into my head: Let me in.

I stumbled backward, nearly slipping on the tiles. My hands gripped the edge of the sink so hard my knuckles turned white. I wanted to scream, but nothing came out. The lights flickered again, and when they stabilized, my reflection was gone. It was just me, standing there, looking pale and terrified.

I rushed out of the bathroom, my hands shaking so badly I could barely turn the doorknob. I grabbed my phone and Googled everything I could about mirrors, hauntings, anything that could explain what just happened. All I found were stories—people who saw their reflections move on their own, people who claimed they were followed by something they saw in the mirror, people who went missing after sharing similar experiences.

I didn’t sleep last night. I spent the whole time staring at my covered bathroom mirror, watching the fabric shift like something was moving behind it. I don’t know how long I sat there, clutching the handle of my kitchen knife, but eventually, exhaustion won. When I woke up, it was dawn, and the apartment was silent.

I thought maybe it was over, that whatever it was, it had left. But then, as I was brushing my teeth this morning, I heard it again. A faint whisper, coming from behind the mirror. I froze, not daring to look, but I couldn’t ignore the words.

Let me in. It’s so cold.

I grabbed my keys and ran out of the apartment. I’m sitting in a coffee shop now, trying to figure out what to do. I want to call someone—maybe a priest, maybe a therapist—but I don’t think anyone would believe me.

Whatever it is, it’s still there. I know it’s waiting. And I’m terrified of what will happen if I look into the mirror again. If you’re reading this, please, if you ever feel like your reflection is watching you, get out. Don’t let it in.",1,1728884185.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

So right now i’m already pretty active: 3 days weightlifting , 2 days 1 hour treadmill and on weekends I bike normally. Bike rides can range from short coffee 15-20 km to long endurance rides of 100 km or more

I’ve recently signed up for a marathon (Feb 2025), training has just started. Homework is to do 3 runs a week on our own in the upcoming weeks, with organized run events on some weekends as part of the training

So with this, my schedule will be this:
3 days weights
3 days running on the days I normally treadmill(for now, 45 mins, 45 mins, 1 hour)
1 day bike if there is a ride i’d like to join / if none, i can make this my rest day

I work from home but it can be mentally draining or stressful but exercise makes me happy so i’m able to find time to exercise even if busy

But above also means i will have an activity every day. This won’t be forever and will only be until the marathon in feb 2025 tho…. The reason why i want to complete this marathon is I want to participate in a standard distance duathlon in 2025 (around sept or oct) that entails a 100 km bike and 25 km run distance and I thought marathon training will help me prepare for this

I’m pretty confident with cycling since I already cycle long distances (max distance was 200km which i did a few times this year) but running is something i still need train on. My fitness level is pretty high but my comfortable pace is probably around 7:15 -7:30 when I run or when i’ve joined a few fun runs in the past

I’m currently at a calorie deficit but my gym coach tells me we will have to change my diet further into marathon training

I just want to get your advice if juggling a marathon with my other activities makes sense? 

Tldr 31F signed up for marathon training (feb 2025) as atraining for a major duathlon next year. Need your thoughts 
1. I do not have a time goal in the marathon, i just want to complete
2. I do not want to give up weights nor biking. However i anticipate that marathon training will probably eat any muscle mass i’ve already built :( — perhaps i can just rebuild?
3. My fitnessgoal is to reach my goal toned body (i’m around 2 kgs away), be stronger, have more endurance, both physically and mentally. Right now i’m at50kg pr for lower body and 40kg PR for upper body. I acknowledge i’m at a higher level of fitness than the average person however i’m not a runner yet and i’m concerned i burn out if i keep this up for the next 3.5 months roughly

","Hey everyone!

We’re a couple in our 20s planning a 10-day trip to the US. Last year we spent 10 days in NYC and did a day trip to DC. We loved it. This time, we’re looking for a different kind of trip and want to explore the Northeast for 2 nights. Earlier this year, we went on a Southwest road trip with lots of national parks and really loved that kind of environment, so we’re hoping to find something similar, but departing from New York. We’ll be renting a car and will have 2 nights to spend.

I’m personally very interested in Maine but not sure if it’s realistic to get that far and maybe stay somewhere on the way? I’ve read a lot of options for short trips, but there are so many! Some places that I’ve seen mentioned are the Hudson Valley area, Beacon, Cold Spring, and Mystic, CT. Also heard great things about Rhode Island.

Since we’ll already be spending 7 days in the city, we want these 2 nights to be a refreshing escape. We love national parks, hiking, and charming small towns with nice coffee shops. Unfortunately, we only have time for this quick 2-night trip, so we’d love to hear your suggestions!

Thanks in advance for any advice!

","# Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

I recently came across Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. As someone who has struggled with losing weight for years despite diet and exercise, I was intrigued but also skeptical. Could just adding something to my daily coffee really help me lose weight?

# [ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

I decided there was only one way to find out — try it myself. In this detailed review, I’ll share my experience using Java Burn, including the pros, cons, ingredients, and most importantly — did it actually help me lose weight?

# What Exactly is Java Burn?

**Java Burn is a patent-pending weight loss supplement sold exclusively online through JavaBurn.com.** It comes in powdered packets that you simply mix into your morning coffee.

The powder contains a blend of plant-based ingredients like green tea extract, L-theanine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid. According to the creators, these compounds work synergistically to:

* Boost metabolism
* Increase fat burning
* Suppress appetite
* Regulate blood sugar levels

The overall goal is to help users lose weight by enhancing their body’s natural metabolic function.

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

>

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

Photo by LyfeFuel on Unsplash

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.

1g38vk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SilverEnd1208/comments/1g38vk8/title_femme_fatales_of_havenbrook/,"Title: ""Femme Fatales of Havenbrook""","Setting:

The small, picturesque town of **Havenbrook**—known for its friendly faces, lush green landscapes, and a tight-knit community. It’s the type of town where everyone knows each other, but beneath its tranquil appearance lie buried secrets, intense relationships, and unresolved betrayals. From the rustic cafés to the local diner and even the annual county fair, it’s the place where life moves at its own pace—except for the lives of those caught in the whirlwind of love, revenge, and self-discovery.

# Main Characters:

* **Cinna**: A tough, emotionally distant mechanic with a hidden vulnerability. She’s the go-to fixer for anything broken—machines or hearts. Her sharp tongue hides deep emotional scars.
* **Alinity**: The town's mysterious new arrival with a dark past. She’s a trained assassin trying to escape her former life and live peacefully, but trouble keeps finding her.
* **Thea Hail**: Bubbly and optimistic, she runs the local bakery. She’s the heart of the group, always trying to see the best in everyone but often caught in the crossfire of the others' drama.
* **Tatum Paxley**: The rebellious sheriff of Havenbrook. Known for being fair but tough, Tatum struggles with balancing her duty to the town and her personal life.
* **Jenna Ortega**: A young actress returning to her hometown after fleeing a toxic relationship. She’s trying to find herself while navigating old friendships and new romances.
* **Gal Gadot**: A strong, yet emotionally complex veteran who now runs a martial arts studio in town. She’s haunted by her past but fiercely protective of those she loves.
* **Lyra Valkyria**: The local journalist and investigator, constantly digging into the town's secrets, much to the dismay of her friends and enemies alike. She’s ambitious and fearless, but her obsession with the truth strains her relationships.

# Secondary Characters:

* **Rhea Ripley**: A former friend of Cinna’s, now turned rival. Their relationship is filled with unresolved tension and betrayal. Rhea owns the local gym and has a tough-as-nails attitude.
* **Judy Álvarez**: The town’s tattoo artist, a femme fatale with a troubled past. She’s fiercely loyal but has skeletons in her closet that threaten her friendships.
* **Andreja**: A former spy who shares a complicated history with Alinity. She works at the local library, hiding in plain sight while keeping tabs on Havenbrook’s dangerous undercurrents.
* **Ivy Nile**: A stoic, highly disciplined personal trainer at the gym. Her no-nonsense attitude clashes with her desire for deeper connections, especially with Thea.
* **Michelle Rodriguez**: Tatum’s former partner in the police force. She left after a mysterious incident, only to return and cause a stir in the town. Their unresolved issues bubble beneath the surface.
* **Shakira**: The flamboyant owner of Havenbrook’s only nightclub. Known for her charm and wit, she’s the life of the party but secretly yearns for more meaningful connections.
* **Iliza Shlesinger, Taylor Tomlinson, and Whitney Cummings**: A trio of comedians who host a podcast out of a local coffee shop. They serve as comic relief in the story, offering snarky commentary on the unfolding drama, but they have their own personal battles too.

# Plot Overview:

# Issue #1: The Return

The story kicks off with **Jenna Ortega** returning to Havenbrook after years away. She left behind a broken heart and unresolved friendships. When she walks into **Thea Hail’s** bakery, the tension is palpable. Thea welcomes her with open arms, but there's a hint of hesitation in her eyes. **Cinna** and **Rhea Ripley** are in the bakery too, immediately resuming their cold war. Cinna is stoic, eyes narrowed, while Rhea smirks, their history still raw beneath the surface.

Meanwhile, **Alinity**, who has been living in the town under an assumed identity, watches from a corner table. She recognizes Jenna from her former life, but keeps her distance, trying to stay under the radar.

# Issue #2: Sparks and Fire

At a local town event, sparks fly when **Tatum Paxley** and **Michelle Rodriguez** run into each other. Their unresolved tension from the police force sizzles as they trade barbs.

**Tatum**: “You left when things got tough, just like you always do.” **Michelle**: “And you stayed, because that’s all you know how to do—stay in one place, waiting for life to happen.”

The fireworks between them are interrupted by an unexpected brawl at the fairgrounds between **Gal Gadot** and **Rhea Ripley**. The two warriors clash over a petty rivalry, but the fight is fueled by deeper issues from the past. The scene is intense, but there's an underlying sexual tension that neither of them is willing to admit.

# Issue #3: Love and Betrayal

**Thea Hail** starts to feel conflicted as she gets closer to **Ivy Nile**, who frequents the bakery. Ivy is the opposite of Thea—stoic, disciplined, and emotionally unavailable. But there’s something about Ivy’s quiet strength that draws Thea in.

**Thea**: “You’re always so calm. Don’t you ever want to just… let loose?” **Ivy** (softly): “Letting loose means losing control. And I can’t afford that.”

Meanwhile, **Jenna Ortega** reconnects with **Cinna**, who’s been a rock for her in the past. But Cinna’s cold exterior hides a heart that's been hardened by betrayal—particularly her falling out with **Rhea Ripley**. There's undeniable chemistry between them, but Cinna’s trust issues make things complicated.

**Jenna**: “You act like you don’t care, but I know you do. Why are you so scared to let someone in?” **Cinna**: “Because every time I do, they leave. Or worse, they stab me in the back.”

# Issue #4: Shadows of the Past

**Alinity’s** past comes back to haunt her when **Andreja** arrives in town. Their chemistry is electric, but their history is dark. Alinity once worked with Andreja on a covert mission that went wrong, leading to the deaths of innocent people.

**Alinity**: “I’ve tried to forget that night.” **Andreja**: “But you can’t, can you? Because every time you close your eyes, it’s there. We’re bound by that moment.”

The tension between them is both emotional and physical, as they try to figure out whether they can trust each other again—or if they’re destined to be enemies.

# Themes:

* **Friendship and Betrayal**: The central theme revolves around how friendships can turn into rivalries and betrayals, especially when secrets from the past come to light.
* **Love and Trust**: Every character struggles with trust issues. Whether it's Cinna’s fear of intimacy, Alinity’s attempt to leave her past behind, or Tatum and Michelle’s unresolved feelings, love is a complicated game in Havenbrook.
* **Redemption**: Alinity and Andreja both seek redemption for their dark pasts, while Jenna and Cinna attempt to mend broken relationships.
* **Strength in Vulnerability**: Characters like Gal Gadot and Ivy Nile showcase physical strength, but they are also learning to open up emotionally, revealing a different kind of power.

# Key Epic Moments:

1. **Town Showdown**: A climactic brawl at the county fair between Cinna and Rhea, where years of unresolved tension explode in a dramatic fight. Just when Rhea gets the upper hand, she pauses, and the two share a moment of intense eye contact, hinting at their unresolved feelings.
2. **Alinity’s Revelation**: When Alinity is cornered by Andreja and forced to confess her true identity, the moment is tense, leading to a dramatic flashback of their mission together. As they confront their past, it sparks both anger and longing.
3. **The Bakery Fire**: In an emotional twist, Thea’s bakery catches fire, and it’s a race against time as Ivy risks her life to save her. The event forces Ivy to confront her emotions and admit her feelings for Thea.

# Dialogue Highlights:

* **Gal Gadot to Cinna**: “You think being strong means never bending, never breaking. But I’ve seen enough battles to know—sometimes, the strongest thing you can do is let someone in.”
* **Tatum to Michelle**: “You left me. You didn’t just leave the force, you left me. And you think coming back now will fix everything?”
* **Alinity to Andreja**: “We were killers, Andreja. That’s all we ever were. So, tell me, when did we become the kind of people who believe in second chances?”

# Final Issue: ""The Storm Before the Calm""

Everything reaches its peak during a storm that hits Havenbrook. Relationships are tested, betrayals come to light, and every character faces their reckoning. In the eye of the storm, **Cinna** and **Jenna** finally kiss, while **Alinity** makes the ultimate sacrifice to protect her new life.

The season ends with a cliffhanger: **Andreja** standing over a wounded Alinity, saying, “I told you, there are no second chances.”",1,1728883424.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

1g38o6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1g38o6u/hypo_episode/,Hypo Episode ,"Normally on 500 mg of metformin in morning and at night. Normally I eat really well and take care of myself but I had a really off day on Friday when I was out meeting clients the entire day and did not have a chance to eat an actual meal until 4 pm. By that time I didnt feel great and had a headache. All I had eaten up until that point was a coffee that morning and some chocolate covered pecans which was the only food item I could find in the gift shop of one of the locations where I met one of my clients. 

I should have prioritized my well being and next time I absolutely will, even if that means I’m late, but I plan to pack food to take with me whenever I have days scheduled like this. 

Long story short, my glucose levels spiked over 200 after I ate at 4 and were still high when I was hungry again about two hours later. I took an extra 500 mg metformin thinking it may help lower my blood sugar since I was eating a high carb meal for dinner. That was a mistake. 

Within 3 hours I ended up in an ambulance with a blood glucose level in the 40’s feeling horrible. Before the ambulance got there I had 45 fast acting carbs between 2 juice boxes and a glucose gel and it still was only 52 when they arrived 20 minutes later. I thought I was dying and as a new mom, all I could think about was passing out and not waking up. I’ve only ever had one other severe hypo episode when I was pregnant and on insulin. 

I didn’t think metformin would lower my levels that much. Was it just a perfect storm from not eating earlier in the day? How can I ensure this NEVER happens again? I’m currently diagnosed as type 2 but endo wants to test me for type 1.5 at my next appt. ",1,1728882527.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

Out son has adhd and seizure disorder. We divorced a little over 2 years ago. 50/50 custody but I have them 60% during school year. 

I tried to relocate 1.5 hour away with the kids to go to law school and move closer to both of families, their dad refused at mediation in July. 10 days later he wants to move to a different state but only if I agree to a bunch of unreasonable demands. Neither of us move, I just end up commuting for school. 

He's been harassing and stalking me, has tried to get me fired previously, false reported abuse to dcf, his gf has previously had restraining order requested for stalking her ex and threatening to have him shot and killed, and she moved in with him and the kids one month after they started dating just under a year ago. 


Today at drop off he tells me his gf, who is 10 years younger than him btw, is pregnant and they really want to move to some other state so they can have a better life. He goes on to say that if I don't agree to the custody arrangement he asked about before, if I would consider at least giving one of the kids a better life. 

Like if I could just be so kind and selfless to let one of the kids move with him while the other stays behind, you know, for the well being of the one that gets to go. And he offers to take our daughter and leave our son behind.

Btw- there's nothing wrong with the state we live in, it's just not where he wants to live so of course the better life is in the state he wants to move to. Another effort to try and make his selfish actions seem selfless. 


So anyway, I look at him like WTF? Absolutely tf not?? I beg your mf pardon????? While I lose complete control of my facial expressions, all I say is no, they're siblings and we can't separate them, and he has the AUDACITY to say in this condescending tone, 'really? Not even for at least one of them to get to have a better life? They're young anyway, at least one of them should get to.. just think about it'

And I'm like no definitely not.

I am just so beside myself. My heart breaks for my son. Hes always wanted his dad to love him so badly. And while his dad keeps saying I'm brainwashing him to think his dad is a monster, I'm actually 'brainwashing' him into thinking he's not. Lying to him and telling him his dad loves him and cares for him, just to try to do anything to make him feel okay. 

For his dad to want to leave him behind, and also choose our daughter to have what he for w.e reason thinks would be a ""better life""?

I'm so heartbroken for him. Sure, he has adhd and seizures for some unknown reason we haven't figured out yet, he struggles in school, and needs some extra attention. It can be hard some days. But HE'S  OUR SON. And he's also so sweet and kind and creative. Every morning he wakes up wanting to get me water or coffee, gets his sister out of bed and calls her his sweet baby and is always telling us how much he loves us over and over again. Every time me or our daughter put on a new dress, he tells us how beautiful we look and asks us to 'spin around.' Picks us flowers when we go on walks, and always tries to make us laugh. And all the time he's just dying for someone to love him and tell him he's doing a good job. Which I do constantly like I'm overcompensating for a love I know he's lacking that I'll never be able to replace.

All for his dad to be okay with just leaving him behind so his sister can have a ""better ife""? Amongst all the other ways his dad's treated him. My heart just breaks for him. I wish I could go into his room and hold him, but they're at dad's until Wednesday. 

Has anyone had their coparent do something like this that can relate and share their story?

During this period my periods were REGULAR, like extremely punctual each month. My diet involved veggies+fish+4egg whites for lunch and soup+veggies/chicken for dinner. Inbetween meals I had South Indian Filter coffee and fruits, nuts etc. - all healthy and wholefood stuff. 

After 2023 I couldn’t stick to the diet as I was called to office and IF went at a toss. Went back to normal eating of rice+veggies and basic tiffin and occasional junk. Now here my periods weren’t regular. Gained back all the 10kgs lost previously. 

At present, I’m hitting the gym 6 days a week and have started to jump rope as well. Kind of put my diet back on track with veggies+fish+4egg whites for lunch and soup+veggies/chicken for dinner but cannot stick to IF anymore cuz my work hours are off! 

My question is how did my periods become regular then? Is it because of the diet or exercise or the weight lost? How long should I stick to these for?

Every Human household in Parcelium Prime was woken up by the emergency alarm indicating that an important message was going to be broadcast shortly. With curses and worry every Human on the planet looked into their datapad and awaited what promised to be bad news, they didn't have to wait long...



General Jonathan Armstrong appeared on screen, looking dirty and with a makeshift bandage on his right arm . “Good ungodly hour of the night, you're probably wondering what's going on and are still half asleep so I'll cut to the chase, tonight with the help of my secretary Miss Simone we stopped the assassination attempt of the Imorac Governor of our little planet.” The woman in question moved to his right, she was wearing a white dress covered in blood, thought given the color it was clear it wasn't hers.



“As we all know and some of you probably don't care tomorrow the Imorac and Silos will sign an historical peace treaty putting an end to centuries of conflict, apparently some of the Silos don't agree with this decision and have taken upon themselves to get some personal vengeance this night, knowing full well that in the interest of the treaty anything they do will likely get swept under the proverbial rug.” The general lit up a cigar and took a long drag of it, his secretary promptly took it from his mouth and glared at him while stomping it. He cleared his throat before continuing.



“... Anyway, tomorrow our government alongside the Silos' and Imorac's will call to our better angels, to forgive and forget and I agree.” The man took a second cigar but before he could light it Simone slapped it from his mouth, he sighed. “I agree with the sentiment at least... But that is an issue for the diplomats, an issue for tomorrow, tonight I call to your worse devils! I want every off-duty security officer, every on leave soldier, every reservist, every man and woman with their grand-pappy's vintage slug thrower to find their closest Imorac neighbour and have and impromptu BBQ on their front lawn, you know just in case.”



“Ladies and gentlemen, this is a call to arms.”



The screens turned off for a second before turning back on.



“Oh before I forget, if any Silos are watching this and plan to attack the governor...” The camera pans down to show what the General was sitting on, several Silos pilled on top of each other. “... I could use a few more sandbags for fortifications.”



\*\*\*



“So, how did things go?” General Armstrong was sitting in his office and spoke to his secretary as she entered the room.



“Mostly with no issues, the Silos who tried to sneak in major cities carried only small arms and the vast majority gave up any plans of attack on seeing heavily armed Humans patrolling Imorac neighborhoods.”

I have a job interview in 2 days and I'll be doing a trial for one hour and I'm so worried that I won't get the job because im unable to do the latte art. I really need this job, like I REALLY need this job. I've watched countless YouTube videos since the latte art class and I'm so worried I'm going to make a fool of myself. In the job description they said latte art is preferred and I'm sure if I was to get the job and be successful, after regular practice I will be able to do it. But for the trial, I figured if I can just do 1 hour of nicely presented coffees I will have a better chance at getting the job. I'm panicking I know. But how can I present coffee to look good if I can't do the art?
Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",1,1728881759.0,barista,0,1.0,False

I am running a modified D&D 5e experience with lots of custom features:

* Make your own custom race or model an existing one using a Persona points system.
* Flexible magic point system allows for switching up spells on the fly.
* Melee house rules: sweep attack, charge and flanking – makes combat more tactical.
* Highly magical world with some martial enhancing custom cantrips. Everyone knows a few.

18+ players only. Not because of adult themes, but rather I have no clue what the other players might say or do. That said players are expected to keep it reasonably clean and respectful of one another, **all orientation, all gender and all generation friendly**. I ask that players play good or neutral aligned characters that are willing to work as a team for this first campaign. If you have any lines/veils/concerns send me a DM first before creating a character. If you feel like you'd like to jump in and get started, check out the steps below.

Check out the intro to Reunion document to accustom yourself to the setting and custom rules. This will teach you how to make a character in Reunion using the customized house rules:

Join the Discord (link in google doc ) and say Hi. My only request is that you have a microphone, and you set up a push to talk key, or live in a very quiet environment where an open mic won’t be a hindrance to others.

After reading the rules and setting information, feel free to join the Reunion roll20 room make yourself a character. Don’t worry about what folder your character is in, I’ll move you later to the PC folder once all is ready with your character.:

We’re both ambitious and I loved the idea of being a power couple. I recruited into consulting (no travel) and usually work 8a to 10p M-W but the rest of the week is fairly chill. 

I finished my MBA first and he talked about recruiting consulting also or corporate finance. But he got enticed into IB once he started the program and it was literally never a conversation. He just started coffee chats…and then when he finally got offers, I expressed deep concern that his hours would be 8a-2am most days and always on call. I was very afraid and he just said things like “I know it’ll be hard but we’ll make time” and “this is what I want to do.” So I had hope.

Well it’s been 4 months and I HATE IT so far. He comes home at 2 or 3 am. I hate that he has to drive home so late and so tired. I go to work before he wakes up so we’re just passing ships. He works Sunday - Friday non stop and Saturdays he sleeps and doesn’t like to commit to any plans understandably. 

When I talk about potential house one day, new car, shopping, maybe private school for our future kids or whatever… he just laughs and says “with who’s money, buy it yourself!” He now makes 2x than me. 

He doesn’t have time for romance, and forget about intimacy. Never thought I’d be in a (hopefully temporarily) dead bedroom this young. 

Just feels like… I’m not really getting anything out of this??? Like seemingly can’t enjoy the financial gain? No time love attention OR money?! Feels selfish cause I guess it’s his dream job but idk. 

I promise I’m supportive. Make him meal prep lunch, leave him notes to come home to at 3am, don’t pressure him into any plans or to do anything during his off time. 

But I’m not happy. What do I do.

I’m looking for people that like to try new things, I’ve been wanting to go to different events around my city but it’s been hard to find people to go with. I also need an excuse to get out of my routine and try new things and meet new and interesting people. 

(and find new and amazing coffee shops, if you love coffee you should totally join me on my quest :D) 

I love cats, video games, movies, music, plants, social justice, books, horror movies, playing Tennis, going for walks, going to the farmers market, thrifting. 

Ideally you would be someone who also lived in Texas, but online chatting is fine too (but please know I am a sporadic texter but we all have to have our character flaws to make us interesting, no?:)

She started dating someone a few months after we split. They have been broken up for a month or two now. It's been a year since we were together. I accepted because of course I love food, but she was also making one of my favorite dinners. This isn't the first time we have hung out, it's actually the 3rd in 4 weeks or so. Anyways I go over, and on the way over I start to get in my head a bit because I know her love language is cooking for someone and gifts. I then squash my thoughts and continue on. I get there and she fixes me a plate, I say thanks I appreciate that. Instead of eating at the table she wants to eat on her love seat and use the coffee table as a table and watch a movie. Ok, sure whatever. We talk about a lot of things going on and our shared dog etc etc. Then I have to use the restroom, she says go ahead and use it. I walk in and there is a sex toy just hanging out in plain sight for me to see. Now while I'm in here I again am in my head wondering why this was left out when she knew I was coming and had even made this plan on her own. I went back into the living room sat down and continued to talk for maybe another 30 mins and then said I was heading home. I didn't mention the toy, didn't make a joke about it, nothing. Now I'm wondering wtf?! Should I have said something? Is it a sign that she wanted to talk about sex? Or did she magically forget she just left it on the sink? ",1,1728880232.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

So I was having a discussion with some friends about music listening habits, and I threw around the question, whether if a musical palate cleanser was a thing they needed when you have to come back to a 'clean slate' state to listen to new music or embark on a listening journey. 

In the traditional sense, palate cleansers are things like sorbet, or bread (something mild and unobtrusive), served between courses of strong flavours. There's also olfactory 'palate cleansers' such as coffee beans. 

So I wonder if the same concept can be applied to music, if there's a genre that can be used to 'cleanse' in order to appreciate certain things better.
