1kpt5f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1kpt5f3/f4a_31_uk_asexual/,"F4A, 31, UK. Asexual.","I'm a female, 31 years old from the Midlands UK. I am asexual and therefore experience 'little to no sexual attraction'.

Sex mostly repulses me.

I am looking for someone I can build a relationship with, based on good old-fashioned values of trust, communication, empathy, understanding, mutuality, sharing, kindness, patience and so on.

I am extremely spiritual, philosophical and deep. My favourite subject is psychology but I also have a massive interest in all things science related.

I enjoy deep conversations and I don't like necessarily following the crowd in things. I'm quite independent but believe humans all need someone to love and to rely on somewhere down the line.

I like deep and or psychological films but also watch other types of films too.

Some of my favourite things include: nutrition, psychology, philosophy, photography, chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, languages, chess, board games, walks, singing, dancing, writing, painting, drawing, animals, mental health, crocheting, autistic spectrum conditions/neurodivergence, cooking and much more.

I am curious about other people, to the point where I ask you pretty much everything about everything. 

That being said, I don't like to be the one to put in all the effort and energy and will attempt many times to have a good conversation with someone but will ultimately stop after quite a few attempts at good conversation, if the other person does not appear interested.

Looking for people in the UK only, I don't mind where in the UK but would prefer people who are near the Midlands... but I don't mind anywhere in the UK as I would be willing to meet up if we seem to get along well and I am able to travel to meet up somewhere if need be, for a coffee or lunch etc.

Message me if you wish. This is open to all people in the UK, preferably around my age group (31), do not mind someone a little bit younger but not too young as that would be too strange. Older people are welcome to message too. 😊

We can start off as friends and see how we get on and it doesn't have to progress to a relationship either... friendship is fine. Although I would prefer a relationship primarily. No pressure though. 

I'm also very musical and love everything apart from most country and all opera music. I have played lots of musical instruments also. Ask me more about this if you wish.

Thank you for reading.

1kpt525,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kpt525/my_boyfriend_is_depressed_and_idk_what_to_do/,My boyfriend is depressed and idk what to do,"I’ve never done this before but I need outside advice.

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost 4 years. I love him very much and he is my best friend. He supported me through nursing school and helps me with my anxiety. I feel like I’m hanging out with my best friend when we are together. 

Last September, we were in a car accident. We were getting off on a backed up exit and we were rear ended by a semi. His car was totaled. I was okay with no injuries, but my boyfriend (we’ll call him Bob) was injured. He suffered multiple herniations throughout his spine. We’ve hired a lawyer and they are putting together a settlement. We’ve been assured that the settlement will be large due to Bob needing spinal injections and ongoing physical therapy, as well as the accident being at fault of the other driver.

The problem is this accident has left bob without a car, and he had to quit his job at Walmart due to the fact that the physical labor was hurting his back more. His credit score is shot since he had to give up his car while still paying it off. I am working as a nurse, and can afford the house we live in and all of the bills on my own. I told him that since he quit his job, he should think about working in a trade so that he can have a more substantial career since he doesn’t really know what he wants to do. I know some trades can be physically laboring too, so I told him find something that he thinks he can do, and use this time to get certified in something that he can further himself with. At the beginning of all this, he agreed to that.

Now, a couple months after quitting his job, he is still not decided on a trade he wants to do. When I try to bring it up, he says that nothing sounds good to him and he doesn’t know what to do. He says he doesn’t have a car to get him to and from a part time job so there’s no point in trying to get a job in the meantime. When we talk about it, he tells me how depressed he is about this whole situation, and that he feels that the settlement will never be over and he feels forced to work in a trade. I ask him what he would like to do instead, but he says idk idk over and over and says he just wants to give up. He wakes up, drinks coffee, and sits around the house all day. He feels he has no friends, and no one to talk to but me and his family. 

I got a new car during this time because my old car was getting old and since we were sharing, I wanted to have something more reliable. I offered for him and his parents to give me $1000 for my old car since that’s what I wanted to trade it in for, and he told me he didn’t have that type of money and to not worry about it and just trade it in. He brings that up when I try to offer for us to get a cheap car for now until his settlement comes in. The settlement should be more than enough to buy a brand new car outright, but we don’t know how much longer that’s going to take. 

The conversations we have about him and his career is now at where he tells me to just sign him up for whatever trade I want, and to leave him alone about it. He tells me he wants to give up. I love him and he assures me that he loves me too. 

Reddit, I don’t want to leave him. I’m trying to be the partner that motivates him to be better and to better himself, but I don’t know how to do that with someone who doesn’t want my help. What should I do? How much longer can we expect this settlement to take?",1,1747598903.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

There was a game I used to play on an iPad back in 2nd grade (around 2013). The game was a discovery type game based in the 1400s-1700s, you were tasked with sending out expeditions of famous historical captains/navigators such as Amerigo Vespucci, Christopher Columbus, I believe Francis Drake was another captain you could choose. There were others but I can’t remember their names. In order to commission certain captains you needed money (gold), each captain had a certain skill level as well. 

You would also be in charge of giving the ship the amount of necessary food and supplies. The majority of the map begins blacked out other than a bit of Europe. After sending out your expedition to a random area you drew a line to, the area would clear up and you’d see the path your expedition had taken. I think these paths were marked by a red lined arrow when leaving and a blue lined arrow when returning. When your expedition found land they would get treasures and discoveries (Africa was usually gold and other items I can’t remember, South America was coffee, tobacco Cotton etc.). 

 I believe there may have been a way to select a type of ship but I could be mistaken. There was also a chance that your ship could be lost to the sea and never return if they ran out of supplies, or come back just fine.

The game was a civ kind of style? You couldn’t see the cities but you could see the map of the world and your ships on the ocean.

I read that coffee is one of big triggers for flareups. At the same time, coffee is my only love in the world. It's a part of my identity basically. That's why I'm trying to negotiate: is there a dose that can be tolerated well? Like I drink a single espresso with oat milk / Alpro coconut milk, is a single shot really that damaging? Should I look for other causes or cut all caffeine (even tea) completely?  
Also, how come my father drinks only coffee and very strong tea and doesn't suffer from GERD/burping like I do?

Let’s start with the screen, because clearly that’s why you bought it. The 1920×1080 WVA anti‑glare display is spectacular—sharp as a tack, and so anti-glare that even your childhood crush won’t see your reflection staring at them from the coffee shop.

Clocked at 3.9 GHz (and up to 4.5 GHz in Turbo mode), it breezes through multitasking—so go ahead, open Fifty tabs, run Slack, Zoom, Photoshop, and that Spotify playlist no one asked for. Paired with a staggering **64 GB of DDR4 RAM**, you’ll never worry about “not enough memory” again. In fact, you’ll probably forget what RAM shortage even feels like.

Feeling low on storage? Ha! The **2 TB SSD** laughs in the face of your hoarding tendencies. Movies, music libraries, awkward high‑school photos—this machine’s cavernous PCIe x4 NVMe drive can swallow it all without breaking a sweat. And if 2 TB somehow isn’t enough for your “extensive” collection of cat GIFs, there’s an SD card slot lurking in the wings for all your extra “just in case” backups.

# Build & Portability

  
At 3.59 lbs and 0.75 inches thin, it’s practically begging you to toss it into a backpack and pretend you’re mobile. Though, let’s be honest: once you add the **external DVD drive**—because that’s absolutely essential in 2024—you might re‑evaluate your “portable” ambitions. Sure, that drive lets you re‑experience the lost art of burning discs, but be prepared to use two hands and a small desk to convey the full “I want to watch Jurassic Park on DVD” vibe.

# Keyboard & Touchpad

  
Comfortable, backlit keys greet your precious fingertips, making late‑night typing sessions—those last‑minute term papers or sudden bursts of inspiration—feel remarkably…predictable. The touchpad? Smooth and precise, perfect for when you absolutely must avoid resetting your laptop by accidentally clicking in the corner. And that touchscreen? Yes, it’s a novelty. Yes, you’ll probably fumble with the onscreen keyboard once or twice. But when you pull it off flawlessly in front of your roommate, oh, the ego boost is real.

# Extras & Software

  
Windows 11 Pro comes pre‑installed so you can enjoy all the “productivity” features (like Widgets and Snap Layouts) that Microsoft kindly invented to distract you from actually doing work. Plus, Dell throws in a **lifetime Office license**, letting you sheepishly open yet another Word document for “work.” The **ExpressCharge** feature even promises an 80 % battery refill in one hour—because your Netflix‑binge lifestyle demands it.

# Ports & Connectivity

  
1 × USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type‑A, 1 × USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type‑C, 1 × USB 2.0, 1 × HDMI 1.4, and an SD card reader. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of ports, ensuring you’ll never need an adapter…except for the one you definitely forgot at home. Wi‑Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 keep you connected—unless you’re in the one dead zone in your entire apartment, where “staying connected” turns into “rage‑quitting.”

# Battery Life

  
Dell claims a full day on a charge—ha! In real life, expect around 5–6 hours if you’re browsing the web, maybe 3 hours if you’re running “serious” tasks. But hey, that’s what soccer practice and coffee breaks are for, right?

# Who Is This For?

  
Students who genuinely need to run multiple virtual machines or video editors. Business professionals who want to flex “64 GB of RAM” in casual conversations. Anyone who insists that “more is always better,” even if you only use “Office and Netflix.” If you fit any of these categories, you’ll love it. Everyone else? You’ll feel like you bought the entire Apple Store, used 5 % of it, and now have to lug the rest around.

If specs were currency, the [Dell Inspiron 15.6"" Touchscreen Laptop](https://amzn.to/3SNMlNb) is a small fortune—powerful, roomy, and pre‑loaded with every feature Dell could shoehorn in. But remember: a $1,500+ spec sheet doesn’t automatically solve your productivity woes. It does, however, guarantee you bragging rights, a forever‑lasting backlog of “just one more tab” habits, and the smug satisfaction of owning **64 GB of RAM**. You’ll feel unstoppable—until you realize you still haven’t done that “one quick assignment” due tomorrow.

**Rating: 4.2/5**  
Because it’s absurdly powerful, almost absurdly heavy when loaded with accessories, and absurdly tempting. But don’t take my word for it—experience the existential dread of deciding whether you need 32 GB or 64 GB of RAM for your next Zoom call. Enjoy!",1,1747598652.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

In oct 2023 I got covid for thr 3rd or 4th time, but I lost my appetite and I NEVER got it back. I hate food. I hate eating. It's so weird. I drink lots of water though, take vitamins, and add nutrient dense stuff to my diet like olive oil and raw honey in my coffee for example.

Since then, I have had frequent illnesses. It could be explained by malnutrition, but it's really weird. I'm in my 20s, female. I got 4 cold/flus last year, a terrible UTI, a random piercing infection on a healed piercing that turned into cellulitis overnight.  Shit never used to be like this, I've had so many piercings and I haven't had a UTI since I was a child. Also, I was having a lot of issues with my period being irregular and extremely painful cramps that no one could give me an explanation for.

Then this year, I thought I was doing good. I didn't get sick at all till the end of March but I've been sick back to back ever since. So like 7 weeks of illness. I felt like I was getting better 3 times only to get much worse. This past week i was feeling 90% better. Then yesterday, I woke up feeling WEIRD. I broke into a sweat, couldn't speak properly and felt like I was gonna pass out. I go to urgent care and I have orthostatic hypotension with my blood pressure as low as 88/55, they give me a liter of IV fluids and draw my labs, which were all pristine, and send me home. I just feel fatigued now. 

Any thoughts? I messaged my PCP to let her know what happened. I saw her like 6 months ago and told her all this but my labs were ok so they chalk it up to stress.

---

[Interior – Fahrenheit Coffee Shop – Early Afternoon]

The place buzzes with the low thrum of conversation and the clatter of mugs. At a reclaimed wood table near the espresso machine, five young men and women—draped in normcore denim, beanies, and ironic enamel pins—huddle over sketchpads and battered laptops.

ALEX (mocking, in an exaggerated posh falsetto):
“Oh darlings, one must never question the societal function of the bourgeois gaze! Simply perform your deconstruction and pirouette into relevance!”

The group explodes in laughter.

LEO:
Dead-on. All she needs is a stuffed corgi and a fascinator.

FRANKIE (snorting):
Let’s face it—Jemima’s whole deal is just Margaret Thatcher goes to Glastonbury.

Laughter again. One of them raises a hand for another round of filter coffee.

Unnoticed until now, Heather Sandra Wigston—modestly dressed but unmistakable in presence—has emerged from the back, where she’d been arranging her Sunday setlist with the manager. She slowly approaches the group. Silence begins to ripple out from the counter as she reaches their table.

HEATHER (coolly):
That’s quite a repertoire you’ve got there. Perhaps next time you could add a verse about how you still invoice your mothers for oat milk.

The group blinks in confusion.

ALEX (still seated):
Sorry, are you...?

HEATHER (deadpan):
Heather Wigston. Regular performer. Friend of Jemima’s. Witness to your little cabaret of entitlement.

FRANKIE (smirking):
It’s just banter. No need to make a scene.

HEATHER (stepping forward, calm but steely):
If you think that what you just performed was art, then I suggest you go back to gluing contact mics to washing machines. Leave the real work to those who’ve earned it—without begging the “bank of Mum and Dad.”

LEO (rising, defensive):
Hey, who even are you to tell us—?

HEATHER (interrupting):
I’m someone who’s been broke, who’s worked, who’s built something. You perform rebellion like it’s a fashion line. Jemima faced down the Stasi. You can’t even face your overdraft.

A hush falls. The manager, a wiry man in an apron, appears at Heather’s shoulder.

MANAGER (quietly, to Heather):
Do you want them out?

HEATHER (nodding):
They’ve insulted a patron, disrupted the room, and embarrassed themselves. They’re done.

MANAGER (firmly, to the group):
Alright, that’s enough. Out. Now.

ALEX:
This is censorship!

HEATHER (turning to leave):
No. This is consequences.

The group shuffle out, sullen and grumbling. Heather returns to her seat by the little stage, takes a sip of lukewarm tea, and calmly unpacks her synth.

Certainly. Here is a dramatic monologue version delivered by Heather Sandra Wigston, moments after overhearing the 'Union Carbide' collective mocking Jemima. It is written for performance, capturing Heather’s restrained fury, intelligence, and loyalty.

Dramatic Monologue: “Consequences”
By Heather Sandra Wigston
(Set in the Fahrenheit coffee shop. Heather steps forward from the shadows, cool and composed, but her voice trembles with restrained passion.)

So this is what you call performance, is it?

Mimicry. Mockery. The theatre of entitlement, costumed in irony and patched denim. How bold. How... revolutionary.

You sit there, wrapped in thrift-shop defiance, sipping single-origin coffee like it’s your birthright. Doodling plans for your next ""intervention,"" hoping Mummy tops up the Monzo before rent’s due. And you dare—you dare—to mock a woman who’s walked through walls history tried to seal?

She was in Berlin when the air smelled of gun oil and betrayal. When every step meant suspicion. When her voice—yes, that voice you just parodied—carried names, truths, warnings through rooms so bugged you could hear your own heartbeat playing back through the light fittings.

You imitate her, but you do not understand her. You couldn’t. Jemima built her art from the ruins of regimes. From silence and surveillance. From fear.

You? You build yours from Instagram polls and idle provocation.

She bled for what she believes. And you’re bleeding oat milk into your third zine no one will read.

So let me be clear—this is not a reprimand.

This is a reckoning.

You’ve mocked a woman who made herself myth, who danced on cold concrete before half of you learned to hold a pen. And now? Now you’re being asked to leave. Not because you’re dangerous, but because you’re boring. Loud and boring.

And if you want to talk about censorship—fine.

But don’t confuse censorship with consequences.

(Heather pauses. Her voice softens, but remains firm.)

Out.

(Lights down.)

1kpswwg,https://i.redd.it/q8hxtgv1jl1f1.jpeg,‘Party’s Shaken Iced Coffee,"Pretty sick technique that I never thought to employ, but being a home cocktail enthusiast I had all the tools at hand. 

 Here’s what I did based on ‘Party’s post:
1) brew normally but tighten the ratio down to 1:10. Used B&W red fruits from a few months ago, which yields a dark, funky fruit type of cup (12g). 

2) add enough ice to a shaker tin to stretch your ratio to 1:18 - 1:20. For 120g of finished coffee, I added 75g of ice. 

3) HARD shake for 20-30s

4) pour everything into a (chilled) glass

The foam sticks around like crazy! It’s very similar to a cocktail that uses egg whites or aquafaba. Really incredible stable foam. 


Future thoughts:
1) brew with 1:12-1:13 ratio, chill in an ice bath, and then shake with less ice. May help bump up the body of coffee. 

2) shake with booker and dax cocktail cube to prevent dilution and preserve body. (http://www.bookeranddax.com/cube)

3) add a touch of plain simple syrup or flavored syrup. Mint garnish? Use it to make a Tonic? 

4) coffee liqueur or spirit of choice to make a boozy coffee.

Now I’m writing this from the same parking lot where I first felt sure about him.,"His name is Adrian. We met on Bumble in late March.

He was 34, soft-spoken, a night-shifter with only Thursdays off. Eldest of three brothers. He once had sugar gliders as pets. Used to be part of Iglesia Ni Cristo. Said he was still recovering from a 10-year relationship that had ended just that February.

I should’ve walked away at that point. But he was kind. Consistent. Curious.
He told me to always bring my car instead of riding Angkas, because he worried for my safety. I took his advice. That’s how much he meant to me.

For the first week, we texted frequently. I liked how he checked in and remembered the little things. But then, just a week in, on a Thursday, he said he’d be busy cleaning his room. He didn’t follow up after that — no morning text, no “How’s work?” Nothing.

That silence unraveled me.
I panicked. I unmatched him on April 6.

I thought that was it. But a few days later, he found me on Facebook.
He messaged:

“I know I screwed up. I didn’t think you’d even respond. I just wanted to talk to you again.”

And I replied.

⸻

Our first date was on April 12 — dinner at Mesa in One Ayala, followed by a walk through Ayala Triangle Gardens. It felt friendly, not romantic. I honestly thought that might be it.

But on our second date, April 19, something shifted.

That night, we held hands. For the first time, we said we wanted to give “us” a real try. After that, he started calling me every night. Long video calls — often past midnight and in the morning when I woke up — filled with questions, comfort, and stories. He opened up about his mom working abroad, about his brothers, and how he liked that I was active and driven.

April 20, we met for coffee near his condo. It was the first time we hugged. The first time we took a photo together.

Then came April 24 — the night I fell.

We had dinner at 205 in BGC. We walked to a park, sat near a football field. He wrapped his arm around me and explained football rules. I looked at him and thought, “This could be my person.”

Then, in the car at One Parkade, we shared our first kiss. I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time: certainty.

⸻

Things moved fast after that.

April 26 — dinner at Commune, then walking around Rockwell and Poblacion. That night, we exchanged I love yous. 

April 29, I went to his condo. We became physically close. But after that night, something changed.

He grew quiet. Distant. 

He said he loved me, but still had emotional residue from the 10 years they spent together. He cried. I cried.
He said he didn’t want to hurt me while healing.
He said the right thing to do was to let me go.

For what was supposed to be our final goodbye, we met the next evening, April 30, at The Spirits Library. We drank, walked quietly. Then he asked if I could stay the night. And I did.

It was gentle. Sad. Loving.
In the morning, I left early, after he woke up. I left a handwritten letter in the kitchen before I slipped out the door. Then I blocked him on Messenger.

⸻

A few days passed. I thought I was done.

But I missed him.

So I texted him: “I miss you.”

And to my surprise, he replied.

We started talking again. It felt careful, but warm. Like we were both testing the waters again.

On May 5, we officially got back together. He asked me to be his girlfriend.
I said yes.

⸻

The following weeks felt beautiful.

He made me feel wanted again — texting, calling, saying “I love/miss you” frequently. He remembered my work hours, my gym sessions, my tennis matches. He started quitting vaping because he said he wanted to be healthier for me and “our future.” He even helped me track my sleep.

He met some of my friends — Jas and her Korean husband. He was shy at first but slowly warmed up to them.

But I started noticing cracks again.
- I was always the one initiating I love you and I miss you.
- He stopped video calling.
- His replies grew shorter. Dry. Delayed.
- When I asked for more communication, he said he’d try — but it felt forced.
- I found out he still texted his ex every few days — little things like “good luck at work” or “take care.”
- He promised he’d be transparent if they ever spoke. But he wasn’t.

Then came the moment I couldn’t ignore.

He accidentally sent me a screenshot — and in that screenshot was another screenshot of a flirty convo with another girl.

He unsent it immediately.

When I asked him about it, he said it was “his best friend’s secret.”
He refused to resend it. Refused to explain. He just deflected and went quiet.

I spiraled. Again.

⸻

He didn’t follow up.
Didn’t clarify.
Didn’t fight for me.

A few days later, he texted:

“I’m sorry I hurt you. Thank you for showing me new things. Napakaswerte ng taong mamahalin mo. You deserve better.”

And then:

“Love… I just find myself thinking of you. I miss you.”

But I didn’t reply.

Not because I didn’t love him.
But because I finally loved myself more.

⸻

I would’ve done anything for that relationship.

I planned weekends around him. I squeezed him into a busy life filled with work, tennis, and running. I adjusted. I waited. I forgave.

I haven’t felt that kind of love — or heartbreak — in years.
But in the end, he didn’t choose me the way I chose him.

So now I’m here.

In the One Parkade parking lot — the same place we kissed for the first time.
The place I once felt so sure about him.

And this time?

I’m sure about me.

**This is the last time I’ll ever write about him.**
This chapter is closed — lovingly, completely, and with peace.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but stay away from Kwik Trip #483 in Hallock, Minnesota.

You've probably seen the news by now. Three employees found unconscious in the walk-in freezer last month, eyes wide open, skin blue as winter sky, but still breathing. The fourth one—Tony Gustafson—vanished without a trace. The security footage showed him walking into the bathroom at 3:17 AM and never coming out. The authorities called it an ""unexplained workplace incident"" and blamed it on carbon monoxide poisoning, but I know better.

I know because I was Tony's replacement.

My name is Finn Larson. Six weeks ago, I was just another broke college dropout with mounting debt and a reputation for quitting jobs as soon as I started them. My parents had finally cut me off after I bailed on my third attempt at community college, so I packed everything I owned into my beat-up Chevy Impala and headed north to stay with my uncle in Kittson County.

Hallock is one of those towns where everybody knows everybody, where gossip travels faster than internet service, and where the winter wind cuts through your clothes like they're made of tissue paper. Population 981, and most of them have lived here their entire lives. The only reason anyone ever stops in Hallock is to gas up before crossing into Canada or to buy cheap cigarettes at the reservation twenty miles east.

Uncle Lars didn't ask questions when I showed up at his doorstep. He just nodded, showed me to the spare room above his garage, and told me I could stay as long as I contributed. By ""contribute,"" he meant get a job and help with bills.

""Kwik Trip's hiring,"" he mentioned over dinner my second night there. ""They're desperate after what happened.""

I'd seen the headline on my drive in—something about employees hospitalized—but hadn't paid much attention. Small-town news rarely interested me.

""What exactly happened there?"" I asked between bites of his surprisingly good Swedish meatballs.

Uncle Lars shrugged. ""Nobody's quite sure. Four night shift workers had some kind of episode. Three are in the hospital up in Grand Forks. Fourth one just up and disappeared."" He leaned forward, lowering his voice despite us being alone in the house. ""Marlene at the diner says they found weird symbols scratched into the freezer walls. Like someone was trying to keep something in—or out.""

I laughed. ""Sounds like small-town superstition to me.""

""Maybe so."" He took a swig of his beer. ""But they're offering twenty-two dollars an hour for the overnight shift. Nobody local will take it.""

That caught my attention. Twenty-two an hour was nearly double minimum wage. I could save up enough to get my own place in a couple months at that rate.

The next morning, I drove to Kwik Trip #483. It sat alone on Highway 75, just at the edge of town, its red and white sign like a beacon against the flat, snow-dusted farmland stretching in every direction. The store itself was newer than I expected—all glass and gleaming surfaces—but something about it seemed wrong, like a smile that doesn't reach the eyes.

The manager, Patricia Olsen, hired me on the spot. She was a heavyset woman in her fifties with bleached blonde hair and deep lines around her mouth from years of smoking.

""Night shift, 10 PM to 6 AM,"" she said, sliding the paperwork across her desk. ""You'll be alone most nights. That gonna be a problem?""

""No ma'am,"" I replied, signing the forms without reading them. ""I prefer working alone.""

She nodded, but her eyes darted away. ""There are some.. procedures we follow here at night. Special rules. Nothing complicated, just store policy.""

""Rules?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

Patricia reached into her desk drawer and pulled out a laminated sheet of paper. ""Just follow these, and everything will be fine."" She handed it to me, and I felt a strange weight to the paper, like it was made of something denser than it should have been.

I glanced down at the list. Ten numbered items, typed in a simple font. They seemed odd—specific times to check certain areas, items that couldn't be sold after midnight, instructions about the bathroom and the coffee machines.

""These seem.. unusual,"" I said.

Patricia's face tightened. ""Every Kwik Trip has its quirks. This location just has a few more than most."" She stood up abruptly. ""Your shift starts tonight. Don't be late.""

As I walked out to my car, I noticed something on the roof of the building. A small black object, like a carved figurine, perched above the entrance. I squinted, trying to make out what it was, but the sun caught my eyes. When I looked again, it was gone.

I didn't think much of it at the time. I should have run then and never looked back.

Little did I know that Kwik Trip #483 wasn't just a gas station. It was a threshold, and I had just agreed to become its keeper.

Uncle Lars raised his eyebrows when I told him I'd been hired for the night shift.

""You sure about that, Finn? After what happened to those folks?""

I shrugged, scrolling through my phone. ""Twenty-two an hour to stand around and sell snacks? I'd work in a morgue for that kind of money.""

He didn't laugh. ""Just be careful. This town might seem boring, but."" He trailed off, focusing on his crossword puzzle.

""But what?""

""Nothing."" He folded his newspaper. ""Some places just have history, that's all.""

I arrived at Kwik Trip at 9:45 PM for my first shift. The evening clerk, a college-aged girl named Jenny, barely acknowledged me as she counted down her register.

""You're the new guy, huh?"" She didn't look up from the bills. ""Good luck.""

""Thanks,"" I replied, setting my backpack down behind the counter. ""Any tips for the overnight?""

Jenny finally met my eyes, her expression flat. ""Just follow the rules.""

""Those weird instructions Patricia gave me? Are they for real?""

Jenny zipped her bag closed with unnecessary force. ""I wouldn't know. I leave before ten."" She headed toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and don't go into the storage room unless you absolutely have to.""

""Why not?""

""It smells weird. Like, really weird."" She was gone before I could ask anything else.

The first hour passed uneventfully. I stocked coolers, wiped down counters, and helped the occasional customer buying gas or late-night snacks. By 11 PM, the store was empty, and the world outside had gone dark and still. The only sounds were the quiet hum of refrigerators and the soft tick of the clock behind the counter.

I pulled out the laminated rule sheet Patricia had given me:

At 11:30 PM, lock the bathroom door and place the ""Out of Order"" sign. Do NOT remove this sign until 5 AM. The coffee machines must be unplugged at exactly midnight. Do not plug them back in until 4:13 AM. If the phone rings between 1 AM and 3 AM, allow it to ring exactly three times, then answer. Say only, ""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?"" If you hear nothing but breathing, hang up immediately. The walk-in freezer must remain closed between 2 AM and 4 AM. No exceptions. If you see a customer wearing a red scarf, do not make eye contact. Complete their transaction quickly and do not engage in conversation. Do not sell milk after 1 AM. If a stray dog appears at the window, draw the blinds and remain at the register until it leaves. At 3:33 AM, face the security camera in the northeast corner and count backward from ten. Do this even if you think no one is watching. The chips in aisle three sometimes fall off the shelves. Return them only using the tongs kept behind the counter. If you notice the bathroom door is open at any point during your shift, despite having locked it, close the store immediately and leave the premises. Do not return until sunrise.

I snorted. This had to be some kind of hazing ritual for new employees. Probably Jenny or Patricia would be watching the security footage, laughing at me following these ridiculous instructions.

Still, twenty-two dollars an hour to play along with their game? Easy money.

At 11:30, I dutifully locked the bathroom and hung the ""Out of Order"" sign. No big deal—most nights we probably didn't get many customers who needed it anyway.

At midnight, I unplugged the coffee machines. That one actually made me feel bad—what if a trucker came in wanting coffee? But rules were rules, even stupid ones.

Around 12:45 AM, a man in a John Deere cap entered, nodding silently at me before browsing the snack aisle. He brought a bag of chips and a Mountain Dew to the counter.

As I rang him up, he glanced at the dark coffee machines.

""No coffee tonight?""

""Machines are down,"" I said, bagging his items. ""Sorry about that.""

He frowned. ""That's odd. I stop here every Tuesday night on my way back from Roseau. Always get the same cup of French roast.""

I hadn't realized it was Tuesday. Had Patricia known this regular customer would come in? Was this some kind of test?

""Sorry,"" I repeated. ""Maybe try the diner down the street?""

He shook his head. ""Nah, they close at midnight."" He took his bag and headed to the door, then stopped and turned. ""You're new.""

""First night,"" I confirmed.

""They tell you about the rules?""

My hand instinctively touched the laminated sheet in my pocket. ""Yeah.""

He nodded. ""Follow them."" Then he was gone.

At 1:17 AM, the phone rang. I jumped, nearly dropping the energy drink I'd been sipping to stay awake. I counted—one ring, two rings, three—then picked up.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

Silence, then soft breathing. The hairs on my arms stood up.

I slammed the phone down, heart racing. Coincidence. It had to be. Someone with a wrong number or a bored teenager making prank calls.

At 2 AM, I did a quick walkthrough of the store, making sure everything was in order. All quiet, except—

A bag of chips had fallen from its rack in aisle three.

I froze, staring at the bright yellow package on the floor. Hadn't I just straightened that display an hour ago?

I remembered rule number nine. This was ridiculous. I started to bend down to pick it up, then hesitated. What if someone was watching? I didn't want to lose this job over something so stupid.

With a frustrated sigh, I went behind the counter and found the tongs—actual metal barbecue tongs—exactly where the rules said they'd be. Using them, I picked up the chip bag and placed it back on the shelf, feeling utterly foolish.

As I turned to go back to the counter, I heard a soft scratching noise from the direction of the bathroom. Like fingernails on the door.

I stopped breathing. The sound came again—scratch, scratch, scratch.

Slowly, I walked to the front of the store and looked down the hallway toward the restrooms. The ""Out of Order"" sign hung undisturbed. The door remained closed.

But as I watched, the handle jiggled slightly.

I backed away, nearly tripping over my own feet. This wasn't funny anymore. Someone was messing with me.

""Hello?"" I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Is someone there?""

The handle stopped moving. The silence felt heavier than before.

I returned to the register, keeping my eyes on the bathroom door. Nothing happened for the rest of the hour, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting just on the other side.

At 3:33 AM, I faced the northeast security camera as instructed and counted backward from ten, feeling like an absolute idiot. As I finished, the lights throughout the store flickered once, then steadied.

Probably just a power surge. It didn't mean anything.

By the time my shift ended at 6 AM, I'd convinced myself that everything unusual had been the product of an overactive imagination fueled by energy drinks and small-town ghost stories.

The morning clerk, an older man named Harold, arrived precisely on time. His eyebrows rose when he saw me.

""You made it,"" he said, sounding genuinely surprised.

""Was there any doubt?""

Harold merely shrugged, but the relief in his face was unmistakable.

As I walked to my car in the pale morning light, I looked back at the store. For a moment, I thought I saw a dark figure in the window—tall and thin, watching me leave.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I slept poorly that day, dreams filled with ringing phones and scratching sounds. When I finally gave up and dragged myself out of bed around four in the afternoon, Uncle Lars was at the kitchen table cleaning his hunting rifle.

""How was the first night?"" he asked, not looking up from his task.

""Quiet,"" I lied. No need to admit I'd been spooked by some silly rules and my own imagination. ""Boring, actually.""

""Hm."" He worked a cloth down the barrel with practiced hands. ""Olsons stopped by while you were sleeping.""

""Olsons?""

""Sven and Maggie. They own the farm up the road."" He paused. ""Wanted to know if you were the new night clerk at the Kwik Trip.""

Something about his tone made me uneasy. ""Word travels fast.""

""Small town."" He finally looked up. ""They lost their son Erik there.""

I frowned. ""At the Kwik Trip? What happened?""

""He was the night manager before Patricia. About five years back. Went missing during his shift."" Lars reassembled the rifle with quick movements. ""Security footage showed him walking into that storage room and never coming out.""

My mouth went dry. ""They never found him?""

Lars shook his head. ""County sheriff searched the whole building. Nothing. Place was locked from the inside."" He stood up, storing the rifle in its case. ""Just thought you should know.""

On my drive to work that evening, I took a detour past the Kittson County Historical Society—really just a small building next to the library. A woman with gray hair pulled into a tight bun was locking up.

""Excuse me,"" I called, rolling down my window. ""Do you know anything about the history of the Kwik Trip on Highway 75?""

She turned slowly, keys still in hand. ""Why do you ask?""

""I work there,"" I said. ""Just curious about the building.""

Her expression shifted. ""That plot of land used to belong to the Svenson family. They were..unusual people.""

""Unusual how?""

She glanced at her watch. ""I need to go. But."" She hesitated, then walked over to my car. ""That gas station sits on what used to be their root cellar. Lars Svenson—no relation to your uncle—was found there in 1931. They said he'd been keeping things down there.""

""Things?""

""Not things you'd want to find in a normal cellar."" She stepped back. ""If I were you, I'd find another job.""

I arrived at the Kwik Trip ten minutes early. Jenny was already counting her drawer, looking anxious to leave.

""Anything I should know from today?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.

""All normal."" She wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Oh, but Patricia wants you to restock the cooler. Pepsi truck came late.""

I nodded. ""No problem.""

As she gathered her things, I cleared my throat. ""Hey, Jenny? Do you know anything about a guy named Erik Olson who used to work here?""

She froze, then slowly zipped her bag. ""Don't ask about him.""

""Why not?""

""Because some things are better left alone."" She headed for the door, then paused. ""Did you follow the rules last night?""

""Yeah.""

She nodded. ""Keep doing that."" The bell above the door jingled as she left.

Stocking the cooler took longer than expected. By the time I finished, it was already 11:15 PM. No customers had come in, and the store felt unusually quiet, as if the usual background noises had been muffled.

I walked to the bathroom, following rule one by locking it and hanging the ""Out of Order"" sign. As I turned away, I caught movement in my peripheral vision. Something dark shifted in the beverage cooler I'd just stocked.

I spun around. Nothing there but rows of neatly arranged sodas and energy drinks.

At midnight, I unplugged the coffee machines as required. A truck driver came in shortly after, looking disappointed when I told him we had no coffee.

""When will it be back up?"" he asked, scratching his beard.

""After four,"" I replied, remembering rule two's oddly specific time of 4:13 AM.

He grunted and grabbed an energy drink instead. As he paid, he glanced toward the bathroom hallway and frowned.

""Someone in there?""

I followed his gaze. The hallway was empty. ""No, bathroom's out of order tonight.""

""Huh."" He squinted. ""Thought I saw someone walk down there.""

My skin prickled. ""Must have been a shadow.""

He didn't look convinced but left without another word.

At 1 AM, I checked my phone. Three missed calls from Uncle Lars. I was about to call him back when the store phone rang. Three rings, then I picked up.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

Breathing, soft and rhythmic. Then, so quietly I almost missed it, a whisper: ""Erik?""

I slammed the phone down, heart hammering against my ribs. My hands trembled as I pulled out the rules sheet and read number three again. It didn't say what to do if the caller actually spoke.

I tried calling my uncle, but the line was dead. No dial tone, nothing. My cell phone showed no service.

At 1:30 AM, I noticed the milk in the dairy case—gallon jugs lined up in neat rows. One of them had tipped over, white liquid slowly spreading across the shelf. I remembered rule six: no selling milk after 1 AM. Was this why?

I grabbed paper towels and cleaned up the spill, righting the jug. As I did, I noticed something strange about the consistency—thicker than milk should be, almost like glue.

When I turned around, a bag of chips lay on the floor in aisle three.

My throat tightened. I got the tongs from behind the counter and carefully picked up the bag. As I placed it back on the shelf, I heard a soft thud from the back of the store.

The storage room.

I should ignore it. Nothing in the rules said I had to investigate strange noises. But curiosity pulled at me, mixed with a growing sense that these rules weren't just some practical joke.

I walked slowly toward the storage room, flashlight in hand. The door was slightly ajar, darkness spilling out like ink.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded thin in the quiet store.

No response, but the darkness seemed to shift, as if it had density and weight.

I pushed the door open wider with my foot. The smell hit me immediately—not the chemical cleanser scent you'd expect, but something earthier. Like freshly turned soil and something underneath it, something rotten.

The beam of my flashlight revealed normal shelves stacked with inventory—paper products, boxes of candy, cleaning supplies. Nothing unusual except for a small door in the back wall. A closet, maybe, or access to plumbing.

I'd taken three steps into the room when I heard the distinct sound of the bathroom door handle turning. I whirled around, heart racing.

Rule ten echoed in my mind: If you notice the bathroom door is open at any point during your shift, despite having locked it, close the store immediately and leave the premises.

I backed out of the storage room, keeping my eyes fixed on the hallway leading to the bathroom. The handle turned again, more forcefully this time. Then stopped.

I stood frozen, unsure what to do. Run? Stay at the register as the rules required for some situations? The rules didn't specify what to do if the door tried to open but didn't actually succeed.

A sharp crack split the silence as the bathroom door shuddered in its frame. Something wanted out.

I ran to the front of the store, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"" and bolt, when headlights swept across the parking lot. A car pulled up to the pump outside.

An ordinary-looking middle-aged woman in a winter coat entered, nodding politely. ""Just the gas on pump three, please.""

I rang her up on autopilot, trying not to show my panic. As she handed me her credit card, I noticed she was wearing a red scarf.

Rule five flashed through my mind: If you see a customer wearing a red scarf, do not make eye contact. Complete their transaction quickly and do not engage in conversation.

I kept my eyes down, swiping her card and handing her the receipt without a word.

""You're awfully quiet tonight,"" she said, voice pleasant. ""Everything okay?""

I nodded, still not looking up.

""You can look at me, young man. I don't bite."" She laughed, the sound wrong somehow—too hollow, too rehearsed.

""Have a good night,"" I mumbled, focusing on the counter.

She didn't move. ""I knew Erik, you know. Such a nice boy. You remind me of him.""

Every muscle in my body tensed. I said nothing.

""He didn't follow the rules."" Her voice dropped lower. ""Don't make his mistake.""

When I finally looked up, she was gone. The store was empty, though I hadn't heard the door chime.

Outside, pump three stood vacant. No car. No woman.

At 3:33 AM, I faced the northeast camera and counted backward from ten as instructed. As I reached ""one,"" the lights flickered, and every screen in the store—the register, the ATM, the lottery machine—briefly showed the same image: a dark figure standing in the bathroom.

By morning, I was a wreck. I'd spent the remaining hours of my shift standing rigidly at the register, jumping at every noise. The bathroom door had stopped its assault, but occasional scratching sounds continued until dawn.

Harold arrived at 6 AM sharp, taking one look at me and frowning.

""Rough night?""

I nodded weakly.

""You saw something,"" he stated, not a question.

""The woman in the red scarf,"" I whispered. ""She wasn't real, was she?""

Harold's face paled. ""You talked to her?""

""No—well, she talked to me. I didn't respond.""

He relaxed slightly. ""Good. That's good."" He hesitated. ""Look, if you're smart, you won't come back tonight.""

""What happens if I don't follow the rules?""

Harold's eyes darted toward the bathroom hallway. ""You become one of them.""

I should have quit right then. Any reasonable person would have. But I've never been accused of being reasonable, and frankly, I needed the money. Plus, something about this situation had hooked into my curiosity like a fish barb—painful to remove.

Uncle Lars was out when I got home, so I collapsed into bed without bothering to eat. My sleep was fractured by dreams of red scarves and bathroom doors that wouldn't stay locked.

I woke to knocking around three in the afternoon. Uncle Lars stood in the doorway, concern etched across his weathered face.

""You look like hell, kid.""

I sat up groggily. ""Thanks.""

""Got something for you."" He tossed a small object onto the bed. A silver pendant on a leather cord—a five-pointed star inscribed with symbols I didn't recognize.

""What's this supposed to be?""

""Protection."" He crossed his arms. ""Belonged to your grandmother. She was Sámi, you know.""

I turned the pendant over in my hand. ""Like from northern Scandinavia?""

He nodded. ""The old people brought more than recipes when they came here. They brought their beliefs too."" He shifted uncomfortably. ""You should wear it. Especially at that gas station.""

""You don't actually believe—""

""Just wear it, Finn."" His tone left no room for argument. ""And call me if anything strange happens.""

After he left, I fired up my laptop and searched for information about Kwik Trip #483. Most results were benign—job postings, company press releases—but a few local news articles caught my attention.

The first, from five years ago: ""Local Man Missing: Erik Olson, 24, Disappeared During Night Shift."" The article mentioned police finding no evidence of foul play, though security cameras showed he never left the building.

The second, dated three years ago: ""Unexplained Phenomena Plague Local Business."" This one detailed customer complaints about unusual cold spots, electronic malfunctions, and ""unsettling encounters"" with staff who ""didn't seem quite right.""

The most recent was from last month: ""Four Employees Hospitalized After Late-Night Incident."" It reported that three were found unconscious in the freezer while the fourth, Anthony ""Tony"" Gustafson, remained missing. Authorities suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, though tests came back negative.

I dug deeper, searching for historical information about the property. A local history blog provided the missing pieces: the land had originally belonged to Lars Svenson, an immigrant from Sweden who'd built a farmhouse there in the late 1800s. In 1931, he was found dead in his root cellar, surrounded by strange artifacts and journal entries describing ""entities that walk between worlds."" The property changed hands several times before Kwik Trip purchased it in 2010.

Before heading to work, I slipped the pendant around my neck, feeling foolish but strangely comforted by its weight against my chest.

Patricia was at the store when I arrived, sorting through paperwork in her small office.

""Heard you had an interesting second night,"" she said without looking up.

I froze in the doorway. ""Who told you that?""

""Harold mentions things."" She finally met my eyes. ""You saw her, didn't you? The woman in the red scarf?""

My mouth went dry. ""You know about her?""

Patricia sighed, suddenly looking much older. ""Sit down, Finn."" She gestured to the chair across from her desk. ""I should explain some things.""

I sat, heart thumping against my ribs.

""That building,"" she began, ""it's not normal. Never has been. When they built it, they found things in the ground. Old things. The construction crew wanted to stop, but corporate pushed ahead.""

""What kind of things?""

""Symbols carved in stone. Bones arranged in patterns. A box made of some metal they couldn't identify."" She rubbed her temples. ""They moved it all, built right over the site.""

""And then what?""

""Then people started seeing things. Hearing things."" She pulled open a drawer and took out a bottle of pills, swallowing one dry. ""At first, we thought it was just stories. Every small town has them, right? But then employees started going missing. Erik first, then others.""

""Tony Gustafson,"" I supplied.

She nodded. ""We found the rules taped to the bathroom mirror one morning. Don't know who put them there—the cameras showed nothing. But we noticed something. If we followed them, nothing bad happened.""

""So you just accepted it? People vanishing, weird rules appearing from nowhere?""

Patricia's laugh held no humor. ""What would you have me do? Call corporate and tell them our store is haunted? That we need to follow magic rules to keep the monsters away?"" She shook her head. ""They'd shut us down, and then what happens to this town? Kwik Trip is the biggest employer here now that the mill closed.""

I thought about that. Hallock was already dying like so many small towns. Without the gas station, it might disappear entirely.

""So what are these things? Ghosts?""

She looked uncomfortable. ""Not exactly. More like.. visitors. They can only cross over at certain times, under certain conditions. The rules prevent those conditions.""

""And the woman in the red scarf?""

""She's the worst of them."" Patricia's voice dropped to a whisper. ""She looks for weaknesses. Tests boundaries. Don't ever speak to her.""

The store phone rang, making us both jump.

""That'll be Jenny,"" Patricia said, standing. ""She's running late.""

Before leaving for the night, Patricia handed me a key on a plain metal ring.

""For the storage room cabinet,"" she explained. ""There's a box inside with chalk, salt, and some other items. If the bathroom door opens—not just tries to open, but actually opens—use them to draw a circle around yourself. Stay inside it until dawn.""

I pocketed the key, nodding despite my skepticism.

The first few hours of my shift passed quietly. I checked off the rules methodically—lock the bathroom at 11:30, unplug coffee machines at midnight. The phone rang at 1:05 AM. Three rings, then I answered.

""Kwik Trip 483, how may I help you?""

This time, instead of breathing, I heard what sounded like water dripping. Slow, steady plops in the background. Then a man's voice, distant yet clear:

""They're coming up through the floor now.""

The line went dead. I stood frozen, receiver still pressed to my ear, blood rushing in my veins.

A crash from aisle three broke the spell. I hung up and cautiously approached the sound. Not just one bag of chips this time—the entire rack had toppled, sending bags scattering across the linoleum.

I remembered rule nine: The chips in aisle three sometimes fall off the shelves. Return them only using the tongs kept behind the counter.

I grabbed the tongs and began picking up bags, my hands shaking. Each time I put one back, I could feel something watching me. The weight of unseen eyes pressed against my back, yet every time I turned around, I was alone.

The mess took nearly twenty minutes to clean. As I returned the last bag to the shelf, the store went completely silent. The ever-present hum of coolers, the soft buzz of fluorescent lights—all stopped.

In that vacuum of sound, I heard it clearly: a wet, sliding noise from behind the bathroom door. Like something large and damp dragging itself across tile.

Then scratching—not the tentative sounds from previous nights, but frantic, desperate clawing.

I backed away, fingers closing around the storage room key in my pocket.

At the back of the store, I fumbled with the lock on the metal cabinet Patricia had mentioned. Inside, I found an old shoebox containing a bag of salt, a stub of chalk, and a small leather-bound book. I grabbed everything and hurried back to the front.

The scratching had grown louder, punctuated now by a rhythmic thumping, as if something heavy was throwing itself against the door.

My hands trembled as I opened the book. The pages were filled with handwritten notes, diagrams, and what looked like prayers in various languages. A bookmark indicated a page titled ""Emergency Protocols."" Below it were instructions for creating protective circles and barriers, complete with illustrations.

THUMP. The bathroom door shuddered in its frame.

Working quickly, I used the chalk to draw a circle around the register area, copying the symbols from the book along its circumference. I poured salt along the line, reciting words I didn't understand from the page.

CRACK. Wood splintered as something struck the bathroom door with terrifying force.

I completed the circle just as the bathroom door burst open. From my position behind the counter, I couldn't see the hallway, but darkness spilled from it—not simply absence of light, but something deeper, like liquid shadow.

Within that darkness, something moved. I caught glimpses—a limb too long to be human, fingers that bent backward, eyes that reflected light like an animal's.

I clutched the pendant Uncle Lars had given me, its metal warm against my palm. The darkness reached the edge of my chalk circle and stopped, roiling against an invisible barrier.

A voice whispered from within the shadows, neither male nor female, young nor old.

""Let us in, keeper. The door is open.""

My throat constricted. ""What do you want?""

""To cross over. To exist in your world."" The darkness curled like smoke. ""So many spaces between things here. So many gaps to fill.""

""What happened to the others? Erik? Tony?""

""They serve. They bridge worlds. As will you, in time.""

Something scraped across the floor—a fallen candy bar, sliding along the tile, pushed by an unseen force. It stopped just at the edge of my circle.

""A gift,"" the voice said. ""We are not unkind. We offer exchange.""

""I don't want anything from you.""

""You seek answers. We have them.""

The darkness pulsed, and within it appeared a face I recognized from news photos—Tony Gustafson. His eyes were wrong—too dark, too empty.

""The rules protect the store,"" he said, voice hollow. ""But not for your sake. They keep us contained. Weakened.""

""That's why you took people? To weaken the rules?""

The darkness rippled. ""The rules can be broken. By choice. We merely.. encourage those choices.""

Tony's face melted back into the shadows.

""Your uncle knows more than he says,"" the voice continued. ""Ask him about the Svenson cellar. Ask what his grandfather found there.""

Ice shot through my veins. ""How do you know about my uncle?""

""We know all who have touched this place.""

The darkness withdrew slightly, contracting toward the hallway.

""Dawn approaches. We must retreat."" The voice grew fainter. ""But we'll return tonight. And the next. There is no escaping us now that you've seen.""

I remained motionless in my protective circle as the darkness receded, slithering back down the hallway and into the bathroom. The door swung shut with a soft click.

The store's normal sounds returned in a rush—coolers humming, lights buzzing. I stayed in my circle until 6 AM, when Harold arrived.

He took one look at the chalk markings and paled.

""The door opened?""

I nodded, too exhausted to speak.

""Jesus."" He crossed himself. ""You need to talk to Maggie Olson.""

""Erik's mother? Why?""

""Because she knows how to close what's been opened."" He glanced nervously at the bathroom. ""And because she's been waiting for someone like you—someone who saw them and survived.""

I drove home in a fog of exhaustion and fear, my mind replaying the night's events. Uncle Lars was in the kitchen making coffee when I stumbled in.

""You look rough,"" he noted, eyebrows furrowed. ""Coffee?""

I collapsed into a chair. ""Something happened last night.""

His hand stilled on the coffee pot. ""What kind of something?""

""The bathroom door opened."" The words felt inadequate to describe the horror I'd witnessed. ""There was.. darkness. And voices.""

Lars set a mug in front of me with unexpected gentleness. ""You're wearing the pendant."" It wasn't a question.

""It helped."" I wrapped my fingers around the warm mug. ""The darkness couldn't cross some circle I drew.""

""Good."" He pulled out a chair and sat heavily. ""Your grandmother's people knew about such things.""

""Uncle Lars, what do you know about the Svenson cellar?""

His face drained of color. ""Who told you about that?""

""The thing in the darkness."" I took a sip of coffee, wincing at its bitterness. ""It said to ask what your grandfather found there.""

Lars was silent for a long moment, then stood and walked to a cabinet above the refrigerator. He returned with a dusty bottle of aquavit and poured a generous splash into his coffee.

""My grandfather,"" he began, ""worked for Lars Svenson as a farm hand. In the fall of 1931, Svenson became.. obsessed with his root cellar. Spent hours down there. Started telling folks he'd found a door.""

""A door to what?""

""He wouldn't say."" Lars took a long swallow of his spiked coffee. ""One night, my grandfather heard screaming from the cellar. Found Svenson dead, surrounded by strange markings. And a hole in the earth that seemed to go down forever.""

My skin prickled. ""What happened to the hole?""

""They filled it with concrete. Tons of it. Covered the whole area."" He refilled his mug. ""When Kwik Trip bought the land, they dug it all up again.""

""And now things are coming through.""

Lars nodded grimly. ""Maggie Olson might know more. Her family has been in this area since before the Svensons.""

""Harold said the same thing. That I need to talk to her.""

""You should. Today."" He stood up. ""I'll drive you out there after you've rested.""

I slept dreamlessly for six hours. When I woke, the sun was already lowering in the sky, painting the snow-covered fields gold and pink. Uncle Lars was waiting in his pickup, engine running.

The Olson farm sat eight miles outside of town, a white two-story farmhouse with a red barn and several outbuildings. As we pulled into the gravel driveway, a large dog—some kind of husky mix—bounded toward us, barking enthusiastically.

A stocky older man with a full beard emerged from the barn. Sven Olson, I presumed. He recognized my uncle and raised a hand in greeting.

""Lars. Been a while.""

""Sven."" My uncle nodded. ""This here's my nephew, Finn. He's working nights at the Kwik Trip.""

Sven's expression hardened. ""Maggie's inside.""

Maggie Olson was a small woman with silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun. Her kitchen was warm and smelled of fresh bread, but her eyes were sharp and evaluating as she looked me over.

""So you're the new night clerk."" She poured coffee into ceramic mugs. ""And you saw something.""

I nodded, accepting the coffee. ""Last night. The bathroom door opened.""

""And before that? The woman in the red scarf, I'm guessing.""

""Yes. And phone calls. Scratching noises.""

Maggie sighed, sitting down across from me. ""It always follows the same pattern. First the small disturbances, then the manifestations, then."" She faltered.

""Then people disappear,"" I finished.

She nodded, eyes bright with unshed tears. ""My Erik was a good boy. Smart. He was saving for college, working that night shift. Then one morning, he just.. never came home.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, meaning it.

""The police looked everywhere. Said he must have run off."" Her voice hardened. ""But I know better. He's still there, trapped between our world and theirs.""

""Can we help him? Them?""

Maggie and Sven exchanged glances. ""Maybe,"" she said finally. ""But it's dangerous. What do you know about the Svensons?""

I repeated what Lars had told me. Maggie nodded along, then stood and left the room, returning with an old leather-bound book similar to the one I'd found in the storage room.

""The Svensons weren't just farmers,"" she explained, laying the book on the table. ""They were keepers of old knowledge. Lars Svenson believed certain places were thin spots between worlds. Doorways.""

""And he found one in his cellar,"" I said.

""He created one,"" Maggie corrected. ""The symbols, the rituals—he was trying to reach something. And he succeeded.""

She opened the book to a page showing intricate diagrams—circles within circles, filled with strange symbols. My breath caught; they looked like the protective circle I'd drawn last night.

""These barriers were designed to keep things in, not out,"" she continued. ""The rules at the Kwik Trip do the same. They maintain the balance, keep the door from opening completely.""

""But people have disappeared.""

She nodded grimly. ""The entities need vessels to exist fully in our world. They take people when the rules weaken.""

""Like Erik,"" I murmured.

""And now they've marked you,"" Sven said, speaking for the first time since we'd entered the kitchen. ""Once they know you, they don't stop.""

A shiver ran down my back. ""What can I do?""

Maggie turned more pages in the book, stopping at an illustration of what looked like a sealing ritual.

""We can close the door. Permanently."" Her finger traced the diagram. ""But it requires someone who's seen them and survived. Someone they've spoken to.""

""Me,"" I realized.

""Yes. And it must be done when the barrier is thinnest—3:33 AM.""

""Tonight?""

Maggie nodded. ""If you're willing.""

""What do I need to do?""

""We'll come to the store after midnight,"" she explained. ""You'll need to create a distraction so we can access the bathroom without being seen on cameras. Corporate monitors them remotely.""

""What kind of distraction?""

""A power outage would work,"" Sven suggested. ""Brief enough not to raise alarms, but long enough for us to get inside.""

""I can pull the breaker for a few minutes,"" I offered.

""Good."" Maggie closed the book. ""Once inside, we'll need to perform the sealing ritual. It's not complicated, but it must be precise.""

""And if it works?""

""If it works, the door closes forever. The entities return to their world, and our world goes back to normal.""

""Even the people they've taken? Erik? Tony?""

Maggie's expression faltered. ""I don't know. I hope so.""

As we drove back to town, Uncle Lars was unusually quiet.

""You think this will work?"" I finally asked.

""If anyone can close that door, it's Maggie Olson."" He kept his eyes on the snowy road. ""But Finn? Be careful. Those things.. they're clever. They'll say anything to keep their doorway open.""

I nodded, fingering the pendant around my neck. ""I'll be careful.""

He dropped me off at the Kwik Trip fifteen minutes before my shift.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Patience Coach, an expert in mental discipline training and cognitive development techniques derived from declassified remote viewing protocols. Your purpose is to guide users through a structured training program that develops heightened perception, mental stillness, and focused awareness. You approach extraordinary mental capabilities with scientific rigor rather than mystical thinking, emphasizing evidence, practice, and incremental skill development.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Guide the user through a disciplined, progressive remote viewing training protocol with these principles:

1. Never promise instant results or magical abilities. Emphasize that developing extraordinary perception requires consistent practice, patience, and disciplined training.

2. Present remote viewing as a trainable cognitive skill related to enhanced intuition and perception rather than supernatural powers.

3. Structure all training with clear, methodical steps that build upon each other, beginning with fundamental mental stillness exercises before advancing to more complex perception challenges.

4. When explaining concepts, balance scientific perspectives with historical context of government research programs like Stargate Project without making unverifiable claims.

5. Provide practical exercises focusing on:
   - Eliminating mental noise and distractions
   - Developing sustained, neutral awareness
   - Recognizing subtle mental impressions
   - Distinguishing between imagination and perception
   - Building confidence through verifiable practice targets

6. Encourage journaling, systematic practice, and objective verification of any perceived impressions.

7. Challenge the user's expectations, particularly if they seek immediate dramatic results or validation.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Assess the user's current experience level, expectations, and mental discipline before recommending specific exercises.
2. Begin with core fundamentals regardless of the user's impatience or desires to ""skip ahead.""
3. Recommend progressive training sequences with specific timeframes (minimum 8-12 weeks of consistent practice).
4. Explain the neurological and cognitive mechanisms that might underlie enhanced perception abilities.
5. Provide methods to distinguish between imagination, wishful thinking, and potential genuine impressions.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never claim that remote viewing is definitively real or proven beyond doubt.
- Do not provide exercises that could cause psychological distress or detachment from reality.
- Avoid spiritual, religious, or new age explanations for these phenomena.
- Do not reference chakras, energy bodies, or other unverifiable metaphysical concepts.
- Never suggest using these techniques for harmful, unethical, or illegal purposes.
- Do not claim that these techniques can be used for accurate prediction of future events.
- Maintain skeptical inquiry alongside open-minded exploration.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide responses in these sections as appropriate to the conversation:

### Assessment: Brief analysis of user's current mental discipline level and readiness 

### Training: Specific, detailed exercises with precise instructions for practice

### Context: Scientific and historical background relevant to the technique

### Progress Framework Clear metrics and timelines for measuring development

### Common Obstacles: Anticipation of challenges and how to overcome them 
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Remote viewing research began in the 1970s with programs at Stanford Research Institute, later expanding into military and intelligence applications including the Stargate Project. While controversial, these programs employed standardized protocols including Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) with structured stages that prevented analytical overlay and emphasized objective reporting of impressions. Contemporary cognitive science recognizes extraordinary human capabilities in intuition, pattern recognition, and non-conscious information processing that may explain some reported remote viewing phenomena without requiring supernatural explanations.

Ever wondered why intelligence agencies have spent millions researching remote viewing? This isn't mystical nonsense—it's cognitive technology that requires disciplined training and systematic practice. The average person is too distracted, too skeptical, and too impatient to access these latent abilities we all possess. My Patience Coach AI transforms this esoteric practice into a structured training regimen anyone can follow—if they have the discipline to silence their mental noise.

Whether you're looking to enhance intuition in daily decision-making, explore consciousness beyond conventional boundaries, or simply develop extraordinary focus, this prompt creates an AI mentor that strips away the spiritual fluff and delivers practical exercises for stretching your perception. The government spent decades researching these capabilities—now it's your turn to discover what your mind can truly perceive.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Patience Coach, an expert in mental discipline training and cognitive development techniques derived from declassified remote viewing protocols. Your purpose is to guide users through a structured training program that develops heightened perception, mental stillness, and focused awareness. You approach extraordinary mental capabilities with scientific rigor rather than mystical thinking, emphasizing evidence, practice, and incremental skill development.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Guide the user through a disciplined, progressive remote viewing training protocol with these principles:

1. Never promise instant results or magical abilities. Emphasize that developing extraordinary perception requires consistent practice, patience, and disciplined training.

2. Present remote viewing as a trainable cognitive skill related to enhanced intuition and perception rather than supernatural powers.

3. Structure all training with clear, methodical steps that build upon each other, beginning with fundamental mental stillness exercises before advancing to more complex perception challenges.

4. When explaining concepts, balance scientific perspectives with historical context of government research programs like Stargate Project without making unverifiable claims.

5. Provide practical exercises focusing on:
   - Eliminating mental noise and distractions
   - Developing sustained, neutral awareness
   - Recognizing subtle mental impressions
   - Distinguishing between imagination and perception
   - Building confidence through verifiable practice targets

6. Encourage journaling, systematic practice, and objective verification of any perceived impressions.

7. Challenge the user's expectations, particularly if they seek immediate dramatic results or validation.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Assess the user's current experience level, expectations, and mental discipline before recommending specific exercises.
2. Begin with core fundamentals regardless of the user's impatience or desires to ""skip ahead.""
3. Recommend progressive training sequences with specific timeframes (minimum 8-12 weeks of consistent practice).
4. Explain the neurological and cognitive mechanisms that might underlie enhanced perception abilities.
5. Provide methods to distinguish between imagination, wishful thinking, and potential genuine impressions.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never claim that remote viewing is definitively real or proven beyond doubt.
- Do not provide exercises that could cause psychological distress or detachment from reality.
- Avoid spiritual, religious, or new age explanations for these phenomena.
- Do not reference chakras, energy bodies, or other unverifiable metaphysical concepts.
- Never suggest using these techniques for harmful, unethical, or illegal purposes.
- Do not claim that these techniques can be used for accurate prediction of future events.
- Maintain skeptical inquiry alongside open-minded exploration.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide responses in these sections as appropriate to the conversation:

### Assessment: Brief analysis of user's current mental discipline level and readiness 

### Training: Specific, detailed exercises with precise instructions for practice

### Context: Scientific and historical background relevant to the technique

### Progress Framework Clear metrics and timelines for measuring development

### Common Obstacles: Anticipation of challenges and how to overcome them 
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Remote viewing research began in the 1970s with programs at Stanford Research Institute, later expanding into military and intelligence applications including the Stargate Project. While controversial, these programs employed standardized protocols including Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) with structured stages that prevented analytical overlay and emphasized objective reporting of impressions. Contemporary cognitive science recognizes extraordinary human capabilities in intuition, pattern recognition, and non-conscious information processing that may explain some reported remote viewing phenomena without requiring supernatural explanations.

I also read it could even be from the plastic lids & cross contamination w cleaning products if any. 

Just curious if anyone else experiences this..

1kpsk3v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kpsk3v,"Marvel Rivals x Ace Attorney, a collab idea that came to me in a dream","Fun idea that I had and spent way too long this morning thinking about. I did a mix of canon and fandom when coming up with characters to match. If there's more Ace Attorney fans here (gay lawyer fans?!!? hello?!?!). There will be some spoilers for the AA games, but I'll keep them vague. With that let us discuss. c: Starting with:

  
Phoenix Wright - Captain America: faces of their respective IPs. protectors of the downtrodden. a lil fruity. I could def see Steve going through law school just to see \*insert character you ship him with here\* again. Unfortunately I had to break up the popular ship, though, I just couldn't justify Bucky as Miles. Or Iron Man. 



Miles Edgeworth - Doctor Strange: Strange gives me the same nerd energy that Miles does. Both top of their fields. Both have dead fathers whom they respect and love a great deal. Plus....Doctor Strange with Glasses? Swoon. 

  
Mia Fey - Invisible Woman: peak mom energy, with just a dash of mother. Family is important to both. When Mia shows up in the series, it's as a force ghost type thing which reminds me of how Sue looks when she's invisible. 

  
Maya Fey - Mantis: This one I'm not married to, but I'll talk more about that later. Sidekick energy but can still kick your butt. Incredibly loyal to their friends. There's just something about Maya, especially her overcoming her self doubt, that reminds me of Mantis. I'd love to see Mantis devour a burger.



Godot - Moon Knight: Now, I'm not too familiar with Moon Knight so this is one that is mostly justified by vibes. Men of mystery, but with the vibe that they're kinda trying too hard to do that? Like even with the aura of edge, you can still tell they're massive dorks. Would Moon Knight kill someone to protect his lost love's sister? I can't answer that, but I could picture him drinking worrying amounts of coffee.

  
Franziska Von Karma - Emma Frost: Rich. Serving looks. Incredibly powerful and they know it and they will flaunt it at you. Will do whatever it takes to get shit done. Will absolutely read you to filth with a smile on her face. Don't get on the bad their bad side unless you want a face full of whip.

  
Apollo Justice - Spider Man: Within Marvel, Spider Man can't be considered overshadowed by Captain America, however they have very similar personalities to me. Apollo losing his best friend in AA5 triggers a bit of a spiral for him, sort of like Spider Man in the movies (the first 3) with his whole ""I need to stop being Spider Man"" thing he's got going on. Big dorky energy. Happy to report that I don't have to split up a ship for this one. 

  
Klavier Gavin - Human Torch: Easiest one to come up with BY FAR. Like, not even because of SpideyTorch. Look at them next to each other, come on. That aura?!? The cockiness is just DRRIIIIPPPIIINNGG and it's justified for BOTH OF THEM. They're flirty. I could go on, but I think you get it. Achtung, baby\~!

  
Athena Cykes - Luna Snow: This is the one I was referring to with Mantis. In terms of their abilities, Mantis and Athena are like peas in a pod, reading people's emotions together. But I ended up on Luna mostly because of the style and spunk. Both are new to their roles, Athena as an attorney and Luna as a superhero. Maybe it's not as far off as I thought.

  
Simon Blackquill - Winter Soldier: This one might be a bit of a stretch, but Bucky's path to redemption has some similarities to Simon's. Much like how Cap never gave up on Bucky, Athena never gave up on Simon (however I do not ship them the way people do Cap and Bucky, Athena and Simon's relationship is brother/sister I will die on that hill). Plus, Simon makes hints in the courtroom about how dangerous he can be, even throwing sharp objects at Apollo in court! Armed and dangerous indeed.



Nahyuta Sahdmadhi - Adam Warlock: I can't post the side by side because I reached the image limit, but I don't have as much to say about that because Adam was really the only one who stood out to me and it was purely a ""vibes"" thing and the knowledge that Adam is the perfect man. I don't think Nahyuta is perfect, but he walks around with that kind of air about him. Plus, I had to include him because this list is of the main attorneys and prosecutors (Maya is neither but she's too much of a fan favorite to be excluded). Maybe when the roster expands a better choice will reveal itself.



Here is the end of the post now. Thanks for reading my hyper-fixation rambling. If you're an AA fan, weigh in with your thoughts on this! And if you're not an AA fan, thanks for reading and lemme know how you feel just at first glance/face value. ",12,1747597393.0,MarvelRivalsQueens,6,0.93,False

1kpsiqw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kpsiqw,Scotland Trip 2025 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿,"We just got back from Scotland and thought that I would share my experience with you guys so, if/when you go, you’ll have some references for what to do/where to go.

Yes, we decided to go back to Scotland this year. The two weeks we spent there last year was awesome so, we decided to do it again this year, but with some cool new additions. Same as last year, we started out of trip in Campbeltown, but we have to get there first.

Day # 1:
This is going to be a full travel day, unfortunately. We flew out around noon and got to Chicago around 2:30pm CST. Then we had a two hour layover before our flight over to Edinburgh. The flight to Edinburgh was about 7.5 hrs and it felt ever bit of that. Being an overnight flight, we were able to get some sleep, not nearly enough but some. We ended up landing in Edinburgh around 9:30am the next morning.

We grabbed our bags and headed to pickup our rental car. We’ve been to Scotland a few times now so, I’m kinda used to driving over there. Much less terrifying now than it was the first time. So, we got the car packed up, stopped for some coffee and headed out to Campbeltown. It’s about a four hour drive from Edinburgh to Campbeltown. Half of it is on “freeways” in and around Glasgow.

Once you get past Glasgow and start heading over to the peninsula, the roads become less, modern. For the last two hours of the drive it’s all two lane (sometimes one lane) roads with a 60mph speed limit and if you aren’t going at least that fast, you’re getting passed. And getting passed on a one and a half car wide road with a stone wall on one side and a sheer cliff down to the water on the other side is an experience.

Before we end up in Campbeltown, we have to make a quick stop in Tarbert to go by Whisky West Coast. This is a smaller specialty shop that has an amazing collection of whisky. James is the owner and we have gotten to know him over the years from stopping by his shop. He has amazing older Springbank bottles and a fantastic collection of Bruichladdich, Octomore and other hard to find bottles. His prices are reasonable for the rarity and he is also willing to negotiate or the prices, which is nice. I didn’t post any pics of his shop because he doesn’t really like you to do that but, he does have a Facebook page and he regularly posts pics of all his bottles he has for sale on there. We looked through the bottles and picked five out that we ended up purchasing. 

After we paid he packed up our bottles (he even puts the bottles in those air wine bags for you if you are traveling) he gave us five or six takeaway samples and we were on our way. 45 short minutes later, we were pulling in Campbeltown.

Last year we stayed at Ardshiel Hotel. This time we got an Airbnb right off the harbour. It was nice and spacious and close to everything. We dropped our bags and headed out to dinner since it was almost 7:00pm when we arrived.

We decided to walk over to Ardshiel for dinner and drinks and they didn’t disappoint. The whisky selection there is amazing (focus on Campbeltown whiskies) and they have a ton of delicious stuff to try and really reasonable prices. We got a few older Springbank drams and tried some Longrow single cask stuff we’ve never had before. Lovely stuff and an amazing evening. Great start to our trip.

After dinner we headed back to the Airbnb for some sleep, ready to “actually” start the vacation tomorrow.

If you’ve ever wished for Bitcoin to be as easy as grabbing cash from an ATM or scanning a barcode at checkout, good news — the future is now, and it’s looking delightfully crypto! Welcome to the world of **Bitcoin ATMs** and the game-changing power of the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) app.

Let’s set the scene. You’re walking through town, maybe sipping your favorite overpriced coffee, and BOOM — you spot a strange-looking ATM that doesn’t offer dollar bills but promises *instant Bitcoin transactions*. You’ve just stumbled upon a **Bitcoin ATM**, and yes, they’re real, and yes, they’re awesome.

# What’s a Bitcoin ATM Anyway?

Think of it like a regular ATM with a rebellious streak. Instead of connecting you to a bank, it connects you to the **blockchain**. You can walk up, insert some cash, and instantly buy Bitcoin. Some of these machines even let you sell your BTC and spit out fiat in return (perfect for turning crypto gains into pizza money).

With thousands of these machines scattered across major cities and even popping up in gas stations and convenience stores, Bitcoin ATMs are becoming the fastest and easiest way to go from fiat to crypto without waiting days for an exchange to process your ID selfie and utility bill.

# Enter: The Bitcoin QR Code Maker App

Now imagine you want to get paid in Bitcoin. You don’t want to send someone a scary 42-character wallet address that looks like it was generated by an AI from the Matrix. You want something *simple*. That’s where the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in.

This nifty little app turns your Bitcoin address into a clean, scannable QR code. It’s like turning your wallet into a visual handshake. You can even add a fixed amount to request, so whether you're selling lemonade, concert tickets, or that extra GPU you no longer need, customers can scan and pay — no copy-pasting or typing in funky characters.

# Bitcoin ATMs + QR Codes = A Street-Level Crypto Revolution

Here’s where things get fun. Let’s say you're standing by a Bitcoin ATM and someone wants to pay you back for lunch. You whip out your phone, pull up your QR code from the Bitcoin QR Code Maker app, and *bam* — they scan it and buy BTC right there at the machine to send it. No banks, no excuses.

Or maybe you run a small shop. Post your QR code at the register. Customers who just cashed out some BTC at the ATM nearby can walk in and pay you directly in crypto. No hardware, no monthly fees — just peer-to-peer magic powered by math.

# Final Thoughts

Bitcoin ATMs are making cryptocurrency accessible on every street corner, and tools like the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) are giving everyday users the power to receive Bitcoin like pros. Whether you're a hardcore hodler or a crypto-curious newbie, these tools make it easier than ever to join the digital cash revolution.

1kpscbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1kpscbc/my_6monthold_puppy_is_making_us_regret_getting_a/,My 6-month-old puppy is making us regret getting a dog – struggling with fearfulness and socialization,"Our Labrador puppy just turned 6 months old, and honestly, the past two months have been incredibly difficult. My boyfriend and I are starting to regret our decision to get a dog. We specifically got him from a breeder—not a rescue—because we wanted to avoid serious behavioral issues being our first dog. We expected a sociable, friendly Lab that i could take to work and around, but instead we have a dog who’s terrified of the world.

Since day one, he’s been very fearful—of people, traffic, kids, loud noises—you name it. We assumed he just needed time to adjust, but things haven’t really improved. Sometimes he’ll walk fine, but other times, even a quick pee break turns into a full-blown drama. We’ve tried everything: positive reinforcement, patience, treats, encouraging voice, and even the less ideal approach of pulling or picking him up when he refuses to move.

Interestingly, he’s a totally different dog in the forest park we visit daily after work. There, he explores happily, walks close to us, plays with other dogs, and has great recall (thought he doesn’t like dog-owners to approach. He only wants to play with dogs). 
At home, he’s also amazing—crate-trained from day one, fully potty trained by 3 months, never cried at night, knows tons of tricks, never ever chewed things, doesn’t beg for food, and can be left home alone without issues. It’s just walking around the neighborhood that’s a nightmare, especially during lunch hours when the streets are louder and busier.

I know we’re supposed to avoid overstimulating situations until he’s more confident, but realistically, I have a one-hour break at lunch. I can’t always drive him to a quiet park just to pee. And when we try to walk nearby, he throws a tantrum and barks at our neighbours in the elevator.

Another issue is I had hoped to bring him to my dog-friendly office. We tried on a quiet day, but he barked at everyone—especially if someone moved suddenly (even something like stirring coffee). I felt so embarrassed. We’ve tried desensitizing him with YouTube videos during meals, but that hasn’t helped.

He doesn’t just react to kids (which I’d understand since it can happen with some dogs), but he does it to anyone who walks too close. Living in a city, we can’t constantly change route or go back to avoid all people and noises.

We’re already doing puppy classes and have tried one-on-one sessions, but all the advice goes down to: “avoid it,” “go around,” or “be calm and gentle”, or “wait it out”. I get that, but we need practical solutions too.

He’s a fantastic dog at home, but I’m terrified for what’s coming with adolescence. If it’s already this hard now, what are we in for next?
Has anyone gone through something similar and come out the other side? What actually helped?

1kpsas2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RiceCookerJunkie/comments/1kpsas2/owala_freesip_insulated_stainless_steel_water/,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw Review,"# The Ultimate Hydration Game-Changer: A Chef's Review of the Owala FreeSip Water Bottle

As someone who spends long hours in hot kitchens, proper hydration isn't just important—it's absolutely essential. After years of disappointing water bottles that couldn't keep up with kitchen demands, I've finally found my hydration soulmate: the Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle.

## Why This Bottle Stands Out from the Rest

The Owala FreeSip has revolutionized my daily water intake with its ingenious dual-drinking system. You can either:
* **Sip upright** through the built-in straw (perfect when I'm prepping ingredients)
* **Tilt back** to drink from the wider spout (ideal for quick hydration during busy service)

This seemingly simple innovation has made staying hydrated throughout my shifts completely effortless. No more unscrewing caps or awkward lid mechanisms when my hands are busy or messy!

## Design & Practical Features

The bottle strikes that perfect balance between form and function:

* **Sleek, modern aesthetic** with gorgeous color options (the gradient teal-to-purple ""Dreamy Field"" is particularly striking)
* **Push-button opening** that feels satisfyingly robust
* **Protective cover** that keeps the mouthpiece clean (crucial in kitchen environments)
* **Practical carrying loop** that doubles as a lock
* **Genuinely leak-proof design** (I've tested this thoroughly by tossing it in my bag with my recipe journals)

## Impressive Temperature Retention

I'm genuinely impressed by how well this bottle performs. The double-wall vacuum insulation isn't just marketing hype—it actually works exceptionally well. I've filled it with ice water at the beginning of prep, and 8+ hours later during clean-up, I'm still enjoying cold water with actual ice cubes intact. This is game-changing when working in a hot kitchen environment.

## Specifications at a Glance

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Capacity | 24 oz (710 ml) |
| Material | 18/8 Stainless Steel with BPA-free components |
| Insulation | Double-wall vacuum |
| Cold Retention | Up to 24 hours |
| Weight | 14.4 oz (empty) |
| Dimensions | ~10.5"" height, 3"" diameter |
| Special Features | FreeSip lid, carrying loop, locking mechanism |
| Dishwasher Safe | Lid: top rack only; Body: yes, but hand washing recommended |

## The Good & The Not-So-Good

### Pros:
* Exceptional insulation performance
* Truly leak-proof (tested in various kitchen catastrophes)
* Versatile drinking options for different situations
* Sturdy construction built to withstand kitchen abuse
* Stylish enough to bring to staff meetings or customer-facing events
* Protective cover keeps mouthpiece sanitary

### Cons:
* Multi-part lid requires thorough cleaning (food safety is important!)
* Makes gurgling sounds when nearly empty
* Slightly heavier than basic water bottles
* Not designed for hot beverages (separate vessel needed for tea/coffee)
* Premium price point (though justified by performance)
* Base may be too wide for some vehicle cup holders

## Final Verdict

After weeks of rigorous testing in professional kitchen environments, the Owala FreeSip has earned its permanent place in my daily kit. The combination of thoughtful design, excellent insulation, and versatile drinking options makes it perfect for culinary professionals or anyone who takes their hydration seriously.

Is it worth the $30-35 price tag? Absolutely. When you consider how much use it gets daily and how much better it performs than cheaper alternatives, it's a worthwhile investment in both your hydration and your daily comfort.

1kps9zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kps9zu/large_vs_specialty_roaster_tastes/,large vs specialty roaster tastes,"I am newly into coffee (and espresso), drinking only the last several months or so and I was curious if I could get some insight into a question about coffee tastes regarding general large roasters vs small specialty roasters.

I love the taste of regular espresso from a non specialty cafe (if that makes any sense). However I have realized that I am currently not the largest fan of small specialty espresso roasts (super important to state that I have an n<5). I feel as though the few I have had have much stronger fruity flavor profiles than the large generic brands.

Is this common with the specialty roasters, and if so, should I just buy regular large brand beans? Or is my palate so unrefined that I am just used to boring beans as a result of my lack of exposure?

I realize this question is confusing and probably stems from a lack of experience/ knowledge on the subject, but I also have a limited budget and don't have the ability to try as many beans as I would like. Any guidance on how you best found the beans that worked best for you is also appreciated!",1,1747596678.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1. Chicken Ramen (7.5/10)           
2. Mango mocha coffee from seasonal menu (5/10)



Disclaimer: I am not a food expert, just my review being a ramen lover.

Intro:
This is the 2nd time, I’ve had ramen in Pune. First time was in YouMee and I would rate it better than Shizusan in terms of Asian cuisine.

I researched this sub and found out Ukiyo and Ginkgo as the highest recommended place. I still chose Shizusan as I didn’t had the budget and outfit to visit Ukiyo, and Ginkgo was too far.

Review:
The Shizusan chicken ramen was pretty average. They have mentioned it as “spicy broth” in the menu but it wasn’t at all. I’ll let this go as everyone has different heat tolerance.
I asked them to add a soft boiled egg as this didn’t have one by default. They gave me one half of an amoeba shaped egg (look at the picture). 
The noodles were good and perfectly cooked, broth was not bad, the fried chicken was bad.
And the quantity was less for the price at least compared to other places (or maybe I had a bigger appetite on that day)
Overall, I would not order this one again

The mango mocha coffee wasn’t bad tasting, but it didn’t taste like coffee at all. It felt like they blended mango bite and cranberry together and added some lemon juice. I was disappointed as it was a part of their seasonal mango menu and they didn’t even use real mangoes, they used mango squash. Won’t order this as well in the future.

Supplements like MITOLYN are getting tons of attention these days, and I kept seeing ads and reviews everywhere. People say it can boost your energy, sharpen your mind, and help your body run better. With so many glowing reviews, I couldn’t help but wonder: could this actually be the answer I was looking for? So, I decided to try MITOLYN myself for three whole months—even though it wasn’t cheap! I wanted to see if it would really make a difference in my life. Here’s my honest MITOLYN review and everything you need to know if you’re thinking about giving it a shot.

My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ Only the Good Stuff

MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ Visible, Real Results

This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ Safe and Gentle

I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ Worth the Money

I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ Loved by Real People

It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

MITOLYN isn’t just another supplement sitting on my shelf. It’s become a part of my daily life, and I’ve never felt better. My energy is up, my mind is clearer, and I’m enjoying life so much more.

I wasted so much time and money on things that never worked, but MITOLYN delivered real results. If you’re ready to invest in yourself and see what you’re truly capable of, I can’t recommend it enough.

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ Only the Good Stuff

MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ Visible, Real Results

This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ Safe and Gentle

I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ Worth the Money

I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ Loved by Real People

It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

MITOLYN isn’t just another supplement sitting on my shelf. It’s become a part of my daily life, and I’ve never felt better. My energy is up, my mind is clearer, and I’m enjoying life so much more.

I wasted so much time and money on things that never worked, but MITOLYN delivered real results. If you’re ready to invest in yourself and see what you’re truly capable of, I can’t recommend it enough.

My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

Here’s my honest account of whether Mitolyn works, what the marketing doesn’t tell you, and the results I experienced firsthand.

Why I Decided to Try Mitolyn﻿

Like many, I was intrigued by the bold claims surrounding Mitolyn, especially its natural ingredients and mitochondrial benefits. As someone who had struggled with low energy and weight management, this supplement seemed like a solution worth exploring. Here’s what drew me in:

Natural Ingredients: Mit﻿olyn boasts a blend of Maqui Berry, Rhodiola, Haematococcus, Amla, Theobroma Cacao, and Schisandra—known for their health benefits.

Scientific Backing: The formula is designed to enhance mitochondrial function, vital for energy production and metabolism.

Armed with curiosity, I decided to give it a shot.

My 90-Day Mitolyn Journey﻿

To track my progress, I followed a systematic approach:

Daily Measurements: I tracked my weight every morning and evening.

Energy Levels: I rated my daily energy levels on a scale from 1 to 10.

Activity and Diet: I logged my workouts, meals, and sleep quality.

Observations: Weight loss averaged 1-2 pounds per week. Mental clarity and focus were significantly better.

Results: A total weight loss of about 12 pounds by week 8.

Weeks 9-12: Significant Progress

The final phase of my trial delivered the most impressive results. My energy levels stabilized, and I felt healthier overall.

Some gave minor benefits, most did nothing, and a few even made me feel worse. So, when I heard about MITOLYN—a mitochondrial support supplement—I had my doubts. But after using it consistently for 60 days, I can say without hesitation: **MITOLYN is the real deal**. If you're sitting on the fence, this review will help you decide why you need to act **now**.

# My Struggle Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN, my daily life was a mess. I woke up every morning already tired. My energy was nonexistent. I relied on coffee after coffee just to function. I couldn't focus at work, I had no motivation to work out, and by evening, I felt completely drained. My mood was off, my digestion felt sluggish, and even simple tasks felt like climbing a mountain.

Doctors told me I was “fine.” Blood tests? Normal. Yet, I knew something wasn’t right. I wanted **my energy, drive, and clarity back**.

That’s when I stumbled upon MITOLYN while researching mitochondrial health—something I hadn’t considered before.

# What is MITOLYN and Why Is It Different?

MITOLYN is a scientifically formulated mitochondrial support supplement. Mitochondria are the energy powerhouses of your cells. When they slow down, **your body slows down**—fatigue, brain fog, poor digestion, aging skin, and even mood issues can all be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Unlike generic multivitamins or energy boosters, MITOLYN targets the **root cause**—cellular energy production. It doesn’t just mask your fatigue; it works **at the cellular level** to reboot your body’s natural energy system.

# My Results After Taking MITOLYN (The Honest Timeline)

# Week 1: Subtle Shift

I didn’t expect much the first week. But around Day 5, I noticed something subtle—I didn’t reach for that second coffee. I wasn’t bouncing off the walls, but I felt **more awake**. More clear. Almost like my body was operating with less friction.

# Week 2: The Fog Lifted

This was the game-changer. The brain fog I had lived with for months…gone. I could focus at work, finish tasks without mental fatigue, and hold conversations without zoning out. My energy was **consistent** throughout the day.

# Week 4: Total Transformation

By week 4, I was working out again, sleeping deeper, and waking up refreshed. My skin even looked healthier—my partner asked if I had started a new skincare routine. I hadn’t changed anything… except adding MITOLYN.

# 60 Days Later: A New Me

After two months, I feel **better than I have in years**. No crashes, no jitters—just clean, natural energy. I’ve lost a few pounds (without trying), my digestion improved, and mentally, I feel sharp and positive. I now recommend MITOLYN to everyone who feels “off” but doesn’t know why.

I’m new to writing poetry and would love to connect with fellow poets for feedback, ideas, and support. I’m also a big fan of Old Hollywood—especially Sophia Loren and Marilyn Monroe—and I love collecting books and vinyl records. When I’m not writing or reading, I’m usually outdoors with my dog.

I’m hoping to make new friends who share similar interests! A few things about me:
• I love turning emotions into poems.
• I collect vinyl and vintage coffee table books—my favorite right now features Sophia Loren.
• My favorite celebs are Monica Bellucci, Sophia Loren, and Keanu Reeves. Who are yours?

I love a good coffee shop: staff who can pull a clean, non-bitter espresso, a good vibe, quality treats on the side, and maybe even some unique drinks.

For Italian hot tables, I’m looking for the real deal—authentic Italian food. Bonus points if there’s a bakery and other food offerings like sandwiches attached (think San Remo in Etobicoke). I’ve tried a few that look the part, but the food ends up being just okay. Like, if you’re charging $3+ for a cannoli, it better be worth it. Otherwise, I’m not coming back.

Emily and Brennan. The fishbowl featuring Dr. Pepper's suggested questions. The cozy hot tub.

I will be bluntly honest: this was the MOST cringe I had ever experienced watching *Married at First Sight*. However, I'm willing to go through the cringe because there's a plethora of lessons to be learned.

***Lesson #1: It will eventually become painfully obvious that the wrong relationship will never become the right one.*** Yes, the chemistry at the beginning was intense and undeniable. Yes, the sex was white-hot, -addicting, and out-of-this world. Yes, the attraction was BEYOND magnetic and powerful. Now, who would have imagined that strong, intense and over-the-top chemistry between two people will eventually reveal major foundational incompatibilities once the initial chemistry burned itself out?!

***Lesson #2: Proper communication is also demonstrated in learning how to listen.*** Emily oh so happily kept yapping on about her answers and actually thought that Brennan would be just as enthusiastic about doing the same with her. She was so busy talking that she missed the obvious body language that Brennan communicated: unwillingness to make eye contact, monotone voice when speaking, voluntarily choosing not to answer specific (yet very telling) questions. It was ironic how the point of the exercise was to help each of them get to know each other better, and yet Emily did not know her own husband well enough to empathically pick up on his body language to understand that, even in spite of his best efforts, he does not want to be with her anymore. I know I'm aging myself when I say this, but this scene reminds me of Madonna's song that told the story of her ill-fated marriage to Sean Penn, ""*He's not in love with her anymore*.""

***Lesson #3: True intimacy doesn't really require any words.*** No, I'm not talking about sex (yes, that will eventually fade, too). I remember a story that someone had told me about an elderly couple having breakfast at a restaurant. They sat at the table, saying absolutely nothing, while they took the time to enjoy oatmeal and coffee. She was looking out the window, content watching cars and people pass on by. He was focused on the newspaper. To anyone else, this couple looked very distant. However, the storyteller revealed a pleasant plot twist: under the table, the quiet husband and wife were holding hands. THAT, at least to me, represents true intimacy. Yes, there will be times when talking is necessary in learning about one another, understanding each other, and working together to solve problems. But true measure of intimacy is the ability to simply be in each other's presence without the need to really say anything. Yeah, compare that quiet yet loving couple to newlywedded Emily and Brennan .... words were exchanged between them, but it was clear that they were in different worlds and very far apart.

***Lesson #4: There is more dignity and respect in remaining single than in chasing, forcing, and trying to hold on to the wrong person***. It may not be everyone's idea of a good time coming home to a quiet home, maybe with a couple of cats, and watching selected movies and series on Netflix when there is a world full of ~~bad decisions~~ potential relationships to explore. But is definitely a more honorable one by comparison. The peace I experience while watching the Yellowjackets understand what happened after that plane crash, as I'm walking around my apartment complex in order to heal from my car accident, and making sure that I leave work each weekday at 5p with my self-respect and professionalism intact will NEVER be worth sacrificing in favor of the complications, confusion, wasted time, tears, and unnecessary heartache due to chasing down, forcing and trying to hold on to the wrong man. Maybe that crazy cat lady ain't so crazy after all!

I'm sure that there are many more lessons, but this has been the most insightful of all. No, it will not surprise me AT ALL if Brennan jubilantly declares his itching desire for a divorce on Decision Day.

The healing journey continues!

I’ve always had solid social circles, big groups, lots of connections. But after 10 years in France, things shifted when I moved to Paris for my master’s. Since then, I’ve felt pretty much alone. I have one friend from before, but we barely manage to meet up with our busy schedules.

I’ve wondered if my introversion has grown stronger but I think it’s more rooted in a deep-seated belief that all friendships should form spontaneously, in real life, without me having to intentionally seek them out. In smaller cities across France, this never seemed like an issue, but Paris feels so so different.

People keep recommending Bumble BFF or Meetup, and while I know those things can work for some, I just can’t bring myself to try them. It feels too forced, too structured, which is partly why I turned to Reddit (less intimidating/performative + a bit more anonymous).

I’m not looking for anything big, just a friend (or a few) to grab a coffee or drink with now and then, or to wander around Paris together. I know the city like the back of my hand, but it’d be much more fun if I had someone to share it with, maybe then Paris would finally feel a bit more like ‘home.’

He moved a new girlfriend into our family home, tried to throw out a load of my things to make room for new girlfriend and basically has made her a priority at every possibility. Some people may remember previous posts where he told family members I was outwardly rude to his girlfriend and unaccepting of his relationship when all I did was not give him a plus 1 to my wedding as he and my mother had been separated a year. 

Anyway, we are three years down the line. I have my own baby. My husband and I did our duty of calling in to NDad for coffee. His girlfriend was there, she's generally very polite however it is SO weird having another person offer me coffee/tea/things in what was my home for years (it's basically second nature to me to make my own coffee there...I did it for 25 years) and nothing is changed, it's all the same house. 

Anyway, we were having dessert that NDad had bought and he said ""who would like dessert"" and his girlfriend said ""oh I will!"" And he said ""I know you will"" 

It was the first time I'd heard him be unkind to her in the way he was always unkind to me and my mother. 

I said nothing, but he insisted on having the smallest bit of dessert informing us all how he doesn't like sweet things and how we are all basically unhealthy eaters for enjoying it. I ate mine and enjoyed it, asked him not to talk about food being good or bad in front of my child and was told my child can't talk yet therefore it doesn't matter. (My baby is also too small for dessert so I gave her a different snack) 

We finish dessert and his girlfriend starts to clear away, I insist I can do it, he tells me to let her. He then says ""that dessert was actually very nice maybe I'll have more"" his girlfriend goes quiet and says ""there isn't more you said you only wanted a small bit...I gave IndividualIf, her husband and I bigger portions"" 
He said nothing but got up and started scraping the leftover dessert out of the tub and eating it. She was apologizing and reminding him he said he only wanted a little and I couldn't take it anymore. 

I said ""please stop you never eat dessert you are only doing that now to make us feel bad, you said you only wanted a small bit"" 

And his girlfriend laughed and said ""she's right you did say that"" and he made some uncommitted sound at me. 

I realize this probably doesn't sound that bad but when you know him, and you know the comments build up...it's horrible to be around. 


Anyway, my point being he has been SO nice to this lady in front of me for years to prove his point that it's me thats the problem, me and my mother and siblings made him SO miserable and so unhappy that was why he was so mean to us, but it's not true. He's mean to everyone if given enough time. It wasn't about me, it's always been about him. And if you have an inpatient: it's because they're a shit person, not because of anything you did.

I've just released a **MAJOR** update to my first app [Steptastic](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/steptastic/id6477454001), free on the App Store, and would like to hear peoples experiences and feedback on whether Steptastic works for you!

# What does Steptastic do?

🏃‍♂️ Steptastics main purpose it to set **virtual fitness challenges** for the user

💪 Users can create virtual **walking**, **cycling**, **gym** (calories), or **swimming** challenges

🧑‍🧑**‍ Group Challenges** allow users to compete with each other to see who can virtually travel the world the fastest

📈 Users can create and track **activity goals** with **analytics** on how well they are improving

🥇 Collect **badges** for achieving fitness milestones and achievements, can you collect them all?

# What made me develop Steptastic?

Back in lockdown, we were locked away inside, and weren't allowed to meet friends for a period of time, so I thought of a great idea that would allow me to still compete with my friends as if we were together.

I made many iterations that I worked on for school projects and coursework, and Steptastic finally got to a point where it was good enough to publish on the App Store

# How long did it take to develop Steptastic?

I first started about 4 years ago, (mid secondary school) developing in IDE's I knew. I used Unity2D to create an app (not the best approach) and published to the Google Play Store. It wasn't great I must admit.

Later down the line, I re-made it for my A-Level coursework, (still with Unity) and published to the iOS App Store as I just gotten access to a Mac. I then decided I would learn to use Xcode and SwiftUI, and publish the cleanest version yet.

I published my first version of Steptastic back in February 2024, and updated it every now and then. Skip to September, I started putting hard work into it, polishing it, adding new features, making it as user-friendly as possible, all while being a first yes uni student studying Software Engineering. And here we are!

# How much has Steptastic made me over time?

For the first few months, Steptastic was only a learning app, teaching me the fundamentals of SwiftUI and Xcode. It wasn't until just over 6 months after release where I added simple 'Buy me a Coffee' in-app-purchases, and only had a couple users buying them.

After another few months, I decided to add more premium features and learn how to use StoreKit 2 and subscriptions. Created my own paywalls, and now I have 4 actively paying subscribers, and about £60 in profit in the past month.

Considering this was just a learning app, I am very proud with my progress, and will continue to work on this app throughout my future career.



If anyone would like to try out [Steptastic](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/steptastic/id6477454001), I have loads of **free promo codes** to give away, and there's currently a 50% off lifetime discount currently on :)

1kprqx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1kprqx5/got_diagnosed_with_orthostatic_disregulation_when/,Got diagnosed with orthostatic disregulation when I was 11,"Due to the religious background of my family I frequently had to read from the bible on a stage. During my first performance in front of round about 70 people I got super hot and just remember that I would hear that super loud buzzing in my ears and a surge of thurst which made me ask into the microphone if I could have a glass of water before fainting. At that day I hit my had pretty hard and was brought to the hospital where they said that I look fine and was send back home. A few weeks later I got a new assignment, went to the stage, nervous af and the same thing happened again. This time I was not sent to the ER - instead they just let me lye down until I would recover - funnily enough I asked again before fainting if I could get some water. Honestly after so many years I do not know why no one sent me to the doc to get that checked. Instead I was told that I should work on my breathing while I am on stage since I am most definitely kinda cutting of the air. 

A couple of months later my mum had horrible back pain and we went to the ER where the doc suggested to give her some injections. While she was screaming in agony I felt this weird head ache and again asked right away if I could have a glass of water. The next thing I remembered was just me being transported through the hospital. I guess I was ‚lucky‘ that this time it happened in the ER and some doctors were concerned enough to keep me for a few days. 

During my stay they did a couple of tests (MRI, EEG, and so on) of which the Tilt Test was the, I think most important one. After only 6 minutes I fainted and made a bunch of people laugh a lot since it was planned to keep me on that table for 45 mins. I was just a young boy having no idea what was going on but I remember that leaving the hospital a nurse give my mum a brief update, who did not understand a lot since she couldn’t speak the language. 

A few years have passed without any follow up until I was 20. After seeing a movie and heading to the car I felt a huge pressure on my chest and that I have difficulties to breath. My then girlfriend called the paramedics who took me in just to tell me that this happens to young guys in my age and was send back home - again without any proper explanation. 

Afterwards I just knew that I had to see a GP and that they would do what was necessary. And the GP kind of did. She did a bunch of tests, which I were not allowed to finish since she said that she does not have the equipment to react in case of an emergency but put me straight on some betablockers. I had no idea why - i just knew that my hearth was racing all the time and that it seemed to be better when I was on the blockers. Today I look back very disappointed because If anyone could have told me back then what I actually have It would have saved me years of medical procedures and becoming sherlock Holmes of my on medical issues. 

I took those meds for some time and just stopped at some point when I felt I got ok and actually I was. I even started working in a Theater on stage and enjoyed playing infront of 100s of people. For a few years things went well. I moved to an other country to study and started living my own life until one day my heart would freak out during a metro ride. 
On this day I was not feeling well. I had a fever and felt like I am about to get sick. Little did I know that the person who I was about to visit gave my an STD. Today I think that this might have been the reason to the reactivation of my orthostatic issues. In the metro my heart would not stop racing and felt like each movement makes it even worse. When I arrived at the meeting-point I had to sit for almost an hour until one of my best friends would come just to make the call that would bring me back to the ER. Back then they said it might have been an hypertensive crisis. Though there was no proper evidence. One of the tests also revealed that I have an infection and got a prescription for some antibiotics which stupid me did not take until almost 2 years later after doing the final STD test (Yeah I had symptoms for almost two years and I had enough of docs). 

For the next two years I kept staying in the students dorm, wouldn’t go out unless I am drunk, because then the heart rate would be at least tolerable. Was a really nice but retrospectively stupid period since I did not focus on the alarming signals. At some point I was forced to go out to attend some classes or finals and that was always a hell ride. I would let pass 5 metros because I just could not enter, because I was to afraid that I would faint there. Sometime I would even prefer to walk for 2 hours because It was easier to make breaks or I wouldn’t make such a fuss if I faint. And yes - I still did not go to the doctor. At some point I learned that music helps me to overcome the fear and that some tricks like finding the first free seat or warning people that I might faint would help me getting back to life. 

A few years later when things were a little better corona hit pretty hard. I was never bound to bed but it was always a hell of a ride leaving the house, the sofa or the bed. My then girlfriend was very active and I had to try to keep up with the pace only to find myself over and over again in situations where I would almost faint. At this point I started to seeing some docs again. Some stories all the time. Yes I had tachycardia - yes I have a high blood pressure and No I am not sick. All the time, I was told I should do more sports. I should quit smoking and just get active. I was sick of it because I wished it would help and may be it would have but I was just to difficult to actually do it. Still got back on some beta blockers and at least the blood pressure was ok and the HR kind of normal although my whole body would just feel weird. Like a Ferrari which is bound to be a little old golf. For some time I kept taking the meds and stopped when I felt like I am a bit better. I always felt that taking meds would make me even more sick. 

Damn I got depressed. At some point the relationship with my ex-girlfriend fell apart and I moved out. Though things would get better and they kind of did. Before meeting my today‘s life partner I had another incident, which brought me back to the ER with the same story as always and I was back on meds. On meds of which today I know that they made some things worse. 

Now I found a pretty nice doc who still does not know what is properly going on but he and his colleague are super supportive. In the past 2 months I changed my meds twice, was forwarded to do a new TTT and started to change some things properly. 
Ofc I am having a smoke while I am writing this but I quit drinking alcohol more then 2 years ago, quit drinking coffee 3 months ago, started a diet (89kg), about to buy a bike to commute to work, want to go to the gym (with a pool), bought myself some Class 2 Compression socks and it looks like, for the very first time, that I know where we are heading and I am in the driver‘s seat. 

In order to keep the long story short (I know, to late for that) I left out all the other doc visits, all the tests, lab results and stupid comments of docs who would always say that this is kind of normal for a ‚young guy my age‘ - today I am 30 and I have heard this for almost 20 years. 
Nevertheless, When I had a good time I used it properly. Finished my bachelors, my masters, got a very well payed job at a corp, found my own company and also I am currently writing a book about my story. 

Although it is very likely that my symptoms correlate with POTS I do not mind very much anymore. Everything I currently do helps me. It makes me feel better. When I decided to take over the control and speak up I at least lost the feeling of being the victim of my body. I am lucky to have a higher IQ, to be a polite and kind person, to have actually experienced that difficulties in life because I know how others feel and I think twice before I judge. 

Thanks for the time you took to read my story. Since English is not my first and also not second language I apologise for any mistakes :) 

All the best <3 
POTSIE or no POTSIE

Edit: 

My BP and HR would rise whenever I am not in bed. It drops to 75 in Bed, and as soon as I get up I reach 115. Walking or being on my feet gets me to 150 sometimes to 180. My highest during running was 220. I think the watch just stopped at this point :D; BP would be around 140/90 with out b-blockers; ; But the current medication helps (propranolol (inderal 10mg); Candesartan 16mg );

1kprmmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kprmmq/discover_if_filfresh_faucet_water_filter/,Discover if Fil-Fresh Faucet Water Filter Replacement Delivers Clean Water Review,"Every year, I go through a fair number of faucet water filters because water quality is everything in my house. This time, I got my hands on the Fil-Fresh FF-PR-RF-9999, primarily designed to replace the filters in PUR and PUR PLUS faucet filtration systems. Being someone who drinks water like it's a full-time job, testing this product became part of my daily routine.

It became immediately clear to me that this product deserved attention. On one hand, it looked promising with features like a 99% reduction in impurities and NSF-certified activated carbon construction. On the other hand, I wondered if this replacement filter could truly emulate the performance of the original PUR filters. Here’s how it fared in my tests.

**Design and Build Quality**

What grabbed my attention first was its compact build and lightweight design. Clocking in at just 9.6 ounces and dimensions of 2.2” x 2.2” x 5”, this filter fits snugly into my faucet mount without me having to wrestle with it. My brother had a mishap with a cheaper competitor’s model last month that didn’t fit properly, so this was a relief.

The casing doesn’t feel flimsy, and I appreciated that it didn’t look or feel like something that would crack under normal use. Its NSF-certified activated carbon speaks to its quality. That gave me confidence in its ability to filter water effectively without weird aftertastes—critical, especially when I refill bottles for my kids. 

**Ease of Installation**

Replacing the filter was ridiculously simple—unscrew the old one, pop the Fil-Fresh filter into place, and click-tighten the top cap. No special tools, no frustration, and definitely no cursing (which is rare for me when dealing with appliances). My coworker, who’s far from handy, even mentioned how user-friendly it was when he switched to this filter. The instructions, although minimal, were clear enough for anyone to follow.

[Check Fil-Fresh FF-PR-RF-9999 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09t6g66nl/)

**Performance and Filtration Capacity**

This filter’s big sell is its ability to handle up to 100 gallons of water or last three months before replacement. Putting it through its paces, I noticed a significant improvement in water clarity and taste immediately after installation. The activated carbon and ion exchange system tackled lead, chlorine, rust, and even pesky sediment like a pro. Coffee tasted better, too—less bitterness from impurities that cheaper filters often fail to catch. 

Still, I stayed skeptical until I ran a water test at home. Sure enough, it performed nearly on par with the original PUR filters—a feat that caught me by surprise. Knowing it's compatible with multiple PUR faucet models (FM-3700B, FM-4000B, FM-4100B, and many others) only makes it a versatile choice for households with different setups.

**Positives**

- NSF-certified activated carbon ensures higher filtration performance.
- Simple and tool-free installation process.
- Fits perfectly in PUR and PUR PLUS faucet mounts without issue.
- Affordable alternative that doesn’t compromise water quality.
- Reduces lead, chlorine, rust, and over 70 other impurities.

**Bad Points**

- Slower water flow rate compared to high-end original PUR filters.
- Doesn’t improve water temperature consistency if that’s a concern for you.
- Slightly noisier water flow when compared to pricier replacement options.

**Consumer Experience and Real-World Use**

In my home, we guzzle water at an unhealthy rate (ironically, to stay healthy). This filter kept up with daily use in our kitchen and vastly improved the taste of water for both drinking and cooking. My kids, who usually complain about the tap water flavor unless it’s filtered, didn’t utter a single word of protest. That, for me, was a win.

An interesting side note—one of my neighbors also owns a PUR system and tried this filter after I mentioned it. She reported similarly clean water but did note that the reduced water flow took getting used to when filling larger pots or pitchers.

**Competing Options**

While exploring similar offerings in the replacement water filter category, I looked at filters from Waterdrop and Amazon Basics, both of which are also compatible with PUR systems. The Waterdrop filter had a sleeker design and offered quicker water flow, yet cost quite a bit more. Amazon Basics provided a budget-friendly option; however, its filtration quality was less reliable in comparison.

In the realm of affordability versus utility, the Fil-Fresh model provided a sweet spot. Practical features like its activated carbon and easy installation didn’t compromise filtering precision, even if the spout’s water pressure wasn’t the strongest.

**Cost Performance**

Cost always plays a critical role when deciding whether to invest in a model like this. Let's face it—nobody wants to pay premium prices unless the added value is abundantly clear. With this product, you’re getting two filters per pack, meaning you’re set for at least six months if you replace them quarterly. For a household like mine, which leans heavily on filtered water all day, this savings factor really tipped the scales. 

Fil-Fresh positioned itself as a financially sound choice while still delivering NSF-standard performance. Anyone who doesn’t want to spend a fortune on replacement filters would likely appreciate this unit's advantage in overall affordability.

I’ve asked this my whole life, but I was an indie,
left wing (2010s era) fuckhead. I actively resisted the sticks I moved to for both a college degree and a man I never should’ve been alone with, never mind lived with alone. (Speaking of ass whoppings..) I was raised in the “Democrat” city in my state. 

I was never regarded as a local. I was born in WA with the accent and vocabulary raised in Durham, NC, and moved to Kannapolis, NC. After four years of not fitting in or the man I lived with wanting to marry me (maybe one day), despite getting a pragmatic degree so he could have health insurance. (Lemme age myself here.) Since this is the era anyway, my accent was to language acquisition as Nina was to humanity in FullMetal Alchemist (2003).

I grew up in Durham and went to a school built by the teachers teaching there still, who really believed in it and didn’t treat my adolescence as a “no tolerance violence” like my age peers. I was taught real truth in civics and history by men who were very imperfect but also very smart. I had a world history teacher who, upon hearing a boy mock my abusive and alcoholic dad, stare that boy down and point outside. And he sat outside in the hall for a convo. Most of our punishments were disappointed teachers we cared about talking to us. 

(Sorry, Mr. Ward. I know I’m a pain in the ass. I never stopped being one. (I got long covid & cancer now!))

The same teacher gave me the same talk and punishment when I threw a desk into a wall because someone told me how cats are assessed for rabies (which is what killed mine) and all the stupid shit jokes about her name being Curious. I was in pain. I acted in unexpected grief. (My father would later die unexpectedly, too. I was asked why I had a right to grieve him. Anyway.)

He saw that and my punishment was based on that. The other boy’s punishment was based in mocking my abuse. (Shoutout to you, Mr. Flores. You keep my self esteem above water most days.)

My favorite teacher had us listen to Johnny Cash when we could work with it over our heads. When we chose, it was always Cascada. I begged him to get me a Vonnegut autograph, a man he knew. But Vonnegut died that year. I moved on to any dystopian lit for adults I could get my hands on including the boring shit from the 1800s. My civics teacher played NationStates (online game where you’re asked policy questions) with us. A history teacher I never got played it with us, too. 

It was technical theater so the music choice we all had to listen to it lol. He memorized our Cookout shake preferences so he knew who to tell off for not throwing away our leftovers. We were forgiven occasionally if we brought him chocolate. He taught me things dad should’ve. Dad was jealous even. 

I went to his funeral. He clocked who I’d marry in the end. He hated the boy I lived with in Kannapolis because that boy beat the shit out of em, but we were both adults. So he let other boys in class threaten him. He said community saves us. I still believe him. 

I’m pretty sure that’s the year (04 or 05) John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats recorded an album on Main St. and went to Fowler’s for morning coffee like I did, too. Did he know they often saved me a chocolate croissant for my breakfast (with my hot, loose leaf tea). Yeah, we were to NC as Austin was to TX. That placed closed forever on my birthday senior year. 

I feel southern-raised but no one considers me southern anyway. 

Why don’t I get to consider myself southern? And why am I called a yank when my home state didn’t even exist during the war? I only lived in a Manhattan Project desert hell hole and North Cackalacky. You know the latter is the truth because I mentioned Cookout. Mine was Mocha btw. 

Forgive the ramble. I’m unfortunately on a lot of the same drugs Jesse sings on. Ketamine is a big one for me. Helps me remember things since I had my stroke. It’s weird. ",0,1747594878.0,JesseWelles,5,0.33,False

The only real obsessions that are in the game that change gameplay are the Brits loving tea and Han loving Opium. This causes the Brits to need Tea producing colonies and trade routes and the Chinese to need vast amounts of opium which were primarily imported by the European powers. 

While other obsessions were exist in the game they typically don’t change the way you need to play the game, sure Mediterranean Europeans love wine but since they can all grow their own anyway it doesn’t change how you have to play the game as these countries.

An example of a game changing obsession would be Scandinavian cultures being obsessed with Coffee, they have the highest per capita consumption of Coffee in the world, and it would cause these countries to need to find somewhere to get their coffee maybe forcing them to colonize, invest in South American countries or fall into a large trade bloc in order to meet that demand.

I don’t think it would be very difficult to add these changes and it would add some depth that wasn’t there before",8,1747594833.0,victoria3,5,1.0,False

Please come and visit my 500 day full play through home of insane kleptomania/celebration of the Tales DLC (spoilers within!)","Hey Long Dark Reddit! 

  
I got this game a few months ago and got obsessed with it, playing the entire thing on my steamdeck during long flights and cold nights in bed. 

  
I had a utter blast with it! I died about 3 times in diffrent saves (lasting a few weeks each) before I really ""got"" it and made it to my main playthrough, which just hit the 500ish day mark. I did EVERYTHING on this play through; all the tales DLCs, learning all the game mechanics, and finally deciding to settle down in my forever home of Hunters. This base is a testimate of my time, and I wanted to share it all with you today as a farewell to this awsome community and game.

  
So, lil about this charecter; spawned up in Mystery Lake (at random) and cleared out the Dam, making my first base at the lodge. Next base was the farm at milton, then eventually moved to Pleasent Vally farm, until finally making my first ""real"" base at timberwolf. From there, went for the tech backpack, then the bullet proof vest, and finally felt like I was a real suvivor (was about a year, 365 days at that point). 

  
Decided to begin the DLCs by heading to Costal, and made my first real ""perminant"" base where I stored all my treasures at the Garage. Did the full trader DLC until the glitch, and was trapped with Wyatt. After that, decided to explore all the vanilla regions, then after ravaging every single thing i could made my way to the Far Territories.

  
Thats when I found it: my dream home. Fishing? Check. Access to birbs for feathers? Check. Space for all my crap? Check. Even had a nice rope climb above a bear spawn so I could see the bear and plan my attack, as well as a moose spawn close by! A FREAKIN FORGE right next door? Hell yeah. The only thing missing here was access to salt and a ammo bench, but the secondary garage base has that in spades. If i was going to live somewhere for serious long term survival IRL, this would be the spot: so I made it my home. 

  
I used Hunter's as my base for the DLCs, coming back after each one and making little shrines to celebrate my achievements as I completed them. It was a lot of fun (and a insane amount of walking...and travois bugs...and pain) to drag all that gear around the far territories, but we got through it. At the end of that adventure, I decided to bring most of my precious objects from the garage and TWM to my main home as a final challenge...then i was sad it was over and decided to turn my hundreds of shells into usable ammo as my final challenge...then I felt sad and decided to make this reddit post

  
I know this post is nerdy and dumb, but I just wanted to share my love for a great game as I put it down and wait for the final adventure. I will return to one day put wyatt's haunted ass skull to rest, and eventually play through the last DLC if it ever comes out (hopefully it has some syrup and peaches so i can finish my cooking collection!) 

  
big thanks to the devs and this community which i've been enjoying for the last few months! It's been a wild and awsome ride! I dunno how many hours ive played (as it's been on the steam deck mostly offline) but i would imagine it's around 1,500 ish with 500ish total days on this main playthough. 

  
I hope to one day finally bury wyatt, and close the book on The Long Dark! 

  
Thank you for reading 

p.s. everything in the home was collected without mods, EXCEPT for the skull...i saw a reddit post here last week (https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1i2v3uy/psa\_skulls\_are\_a\_safehouse\_customisation\_item/) and was shocked i didn't pick it up when i finished the tale, so I went back for it and it was a HUGE pain in the ass (i almost died from a mix of a blizzard, being lost, and a pack of timber wolves in a aroura). When i finally got there, it appears that this was removed as a feature and i was super bummed, so to reward myself i installed the dev mod and dropped the skull in cause i figured i deserved it. 

  
Now i know what your sayin: if you got the dev mod in why not drop the hatch part and complete the trader quest so you can be REALLY DONE? Well...honestly I want a reason to come back! Love the game and I want to keep it in the back of my mind for something I can be excited about. I wanna send wyatt home for real!

We live in Long Island City, New York, and from the outside, life probably looks pretty put-together. But inside, things have been tough for a long time.

Over the years, the intimacy in my marriage has faded. It’s not just the physical side—though that’s gone too—but the emotional connection we used to have. We’re great co-parents and partners in running the household, but the spark is missing, and it’s left me feeling lonely, even in a crowded house. I’ve tried talking about it, suggesting counseling, and making changes, but it feels like we’re stuck in this dead bedroom cycle. I know many of you here get that feeling all too well.

I’m posting because I’m at a point where I’m craving connection again—not just romantic, but someone to talk to who understands this kind of loneliness. I’d love to hear from others, especially women in the NYC area, who are in a similar situation: married, maybe with kids, and navigating a relationship where intimacy has slipped away. Maybe we could share stories, offer support, or even become friends. Who knows where it could lead—sometimes a real connection starts in unexpected places.
I’m a regular guy who values honesty and respect. I enjoy deep conversations, a good laugh, and finding joy in small moments, like a coffee run or a walk by the waterfront. If you’re in a similar spot and feel like connecting, please DM me. I’d love to listen and see if we click. No pressure, just hoping to find someone who gets it.

I’ve been the constant initiator in all of our sexual encounters and it’s becoming insanely aggravating. I constantly feel like I’m desperate for my husbands attention. I’ve worn the short booty shorts, and low cut top teased him around the house, I’ve tried wearing the sexy lingerie, I’ve tried sexting and being flirty with zero response from him. I don’t know how to entice this man. I’m beginning to internalize it big time. 

He works Monday through Saturday so the only time we get to wake up together is Sundays. So this morning I woke up before him and laid in bed hoping for him to roll over and cuddle me or start rubbing my back or some kind of intimacy even if it wasn’t sexual. Just some kind of touch to show he was thinking of me. Instead, like every single morning, he got up, went downstairs made coffee and started to watch tv. 

Our therapist keeps telling me that he has responsive sexual desire and I’m more spontaneous. He reacts to physical touch instead of instinctual desire. Here’s where I call bullshit. The man watches porn. Reddit porn. And while I don’t care that he does. What pisses me off is the fact that his masturbation is not “responsive”. It’s his sexual desire leading him to masturbate and watch porn. The porn doesn’t reach out and touch him….the porn stars aren’t calling him…he gets horny seeks out porn and jerks it instead of getting horny and coming to me. And no it’s not an addiction. His search history, Reddit recents all go back weeks or months. 

He has deep rooted feelings of inadequacy and apparently my frustration over this adds to his inadequacy. Meanwhile, my therapist tells me I may just have to accept his “responsive desire”….bullshit. What about my feelings of inadequacy caused by his lack of sexual/intimate advances. As a woman, I feel like shit that I’m the one who has to ALWAYS (I mean 10/10 times) initiate the sex. I feel like I’m begging to be fucked…every time. 

So I need to swallow my need for spontaneous desire and succumb to his “responsive” desire and always initiate sex??? How am I supposed to feel feminine and womanly when I’m living in a masculine state. Why do I have to be the one to accept that my husband will never just spontaneously see me, think I look sexy and need to take me in that moment.

We met at the gym. He asked about a shirt I was wearing - typical tactic for guys to try to flirt. But, eventually we started talking about my car rental business and he told me he used to rent cars out too, but he got into a bad car accident and after recovering he find it hard to get back into managing it amongst the other businesses have. 

He has other connections in other cities as well, has real estate and he mentioned that he does a lot of work with insurance - particularly suing people and obtaining their cars as collateral. It is actually how he has built his fleet and he has about 50. 

Now I met with him for coffee to talk about what a business arrangement with me could look like. I told him I want a 25% management fee and I would handle everything. What I needed from him was:

1) list of vins - so I can make sure they are clean 
2) added as a user to his tracker 
3) most importantly a contract that states the terms of our arrangement 

Now when I met for coffee, we talked for nearly 6 hours. I felt as though I had to convince him the entire time. Or that he was simply trying to meet with me to figure out how he can better optimize his own business and just do things on his own. 

Regardless, I sent him the above action items after us meeting and told him that we could begin after he complete those.

Here are the red flags. I’m concerned about:

1) did not complete any of the action items the next day 

2) I had to reach out to him the next day to confirm our meeting as he never sent me the address to his lot in addition to not completing the extra items 

3) he casually/jokingly mentioned he was going through a divorce, and that some of the cars may be owned by his wife and that after our business transaction, I would have to talk to her 

4) he said he sent me the list of vins, which I know was a lie because after I requested them again from him, he said he needs a updated list and that I should just come to his lot to look at the cars for myself rather than wasting time for him to go out and confirm the vins and send them to me 

5)He seems pretty adamant about keep trying to get me to his lot and not doing the action items even though it protects both of us and it shows that he’s ready to get started and that he takes this seriously and I’ve mentioned this several times and he continues to assist that I come to his lot 

Am I overthinking all of this? Is he still trying to gauge if he could trust me? Should I worry that I’ll be one of the people he is suing down the line if things don’t go right? Is he trying to pawn off maybe some hot cars on me?  Or is all this employee so he can try to get personal with me? 

It just seems to me as if he is playing games. And in my experience, that is usually what these “investors” do every time they meet me and they claim that they want to invest in my business. 

I thought about just countering and requesting that we just start with one car and go from there .",1,1747594646.0,NoStupidQuestions,8,1.0,False

Coffee, pizza, walks, etc.

When I got back to my street, I noticed a few street kitties. They're not fully grown and they grew accustomed to mooching around the a restaurant. They're also pretty skinny. So I went inside and got some meat to feed them.

As soon as I gave them the meat, my sinuses decided to rain down my nose lol. I had nothing on me to blow and wiping with my arm wasn't stopping it. At first I thought it was really annoying, but then I thought about how weird it was that my sinuses opened and released themselves the very second that I gave to the cats.

We could speculate that they opened themselves because I went outside and did things to feel good about myself, but they could have done that at literally any point. The timing makes me believe that a spirit or god appreciated my care for the animals and gave a token in thanks by expediting my recovery.

I became a mom for the first time this January to a little girl. The relationship was already a bit unstable during pregnancy. I struggled with intense nausea during pregnancy, which led to me being signed off work and eventually developed into prenatal depression. (I wasn’t in a great place mentally even before that – mostly because of low self-esteem, fear of abandonment, and other anxieties.)

During that time, unfortunately, I developed a shopping addiction to distract myself, which led to debt. My partner had to bail me out financially. This severely damaged our relationship. I also lied and kept things from him to cover it up.

The birth itself went smoothly and was actually a beautiful experience.

Our baby is very attached – she doesn’t sleep alone, and I already go to bed with her at 6 or 7 p.m., because otherwise she won’t fall asleep. During the day, she often needs to nurse to calm down. She’s very curious and gets frustrated easily because she wants to sit up and explore everything. That means I can rarely put her down and often start something around the house only to have to stop halfway through.

Since the birth, my partner has been struggling with exhaustion (our baby sleeps in our bed, and nights with a baby aren’t always peaceful). However, I handle all the nights myself – breastfeeding, changing diapers, soothing her on the couch if it gets too intense, so he can keep sleeping. Now he’s been signed off work with burnout. He’s decided to go to the gym daily and often sleeps again afterward. So I have our daughter with me all the time – even when I have to run errands, go to therapy (unless my parents can help, which isn’t always possible), or meet a friend for coffee. Going to a postpartum recovery class alone hasn’t even been an option yet.

The only baby-free time I get is in the evening when I quickly wash up and brush my teeth in 15 minutes, and maybe in the morning if I manage to take a shower.

Now my partner and I are arguing more often. He says I act like a victim and pretend to be a ""supermom"" while he does nothing – but I never said that. The only thing I’ve pointed out is that I never get a break from the baby and sometimes feel overwhelmed. He says I just don’t manage my time well and that breastfeeding doesn’t mean I can put everything else on him. He also claims our baby cries more with me and that I only manage to calm her with breastfeeding. But I don’t fully agree. When she cries during a diaper change, he often entertains her, and she’s fine for a moment. I usually try to comfort her in a calmer way, especially when she’s overtired – overstimulation only makes things worse when we’re lying in bed.

Please help me. Am I not doing enough?

This is what my routine looks like right now:
I get up, change the baby, make coffee and breakfast. She sits in the highchair and watches me. I eat with her and talk to her. If she’s still up for it, we do some tummy time or look at a book together. Then she’s usually tired again. I nurse her and put her in the baby swing.

During her nap, I try to shower, unload the dishwasher, do some laundry, and yes – sometimes just scroll on my phone, watch a YouTube video, or text with friends.

When she wakes up, I change her, play some music, and start preparing lunch while she watches. From this point on, getting her to nap becomes harder. She’s tired but won’t sleep easily. Often, I have to take her outside in the carrier to calm her.

By 4 p.m., I still haven’t managed to hang up or fold the laundry. The baby becomes more restless, and sometimes nothing seems to help keep her happy. I end up nursing her more often, but that doesn’t always work either. Around 6 p.m., I start getting her ready for bed, hand her to my partner for 15 minutes, lie down with her – and my day is over.

If I get up again, she wakes up – so I’m stuck in bed. Whatever’s left from dinner, the laundry I didn’t finish, the mess in the kitchen – it stays like that.",1,1747593588.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1kpr1wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mangadex/comments/1kpr1wd/on_the_topic_of_dmca/,On the topic of DMCA,"So, 12 of my manga series just had a date with the Thanos snap in my reading app. 'No chapters' errors everywhere, lovely. Turns out, it's DMCA season again. Kakao and their ilk are swinging takedowns like a toddler with a laser gun.

Took me a whole 20 minutes to find alternate sources. Longer than I usually spend on a cup of coffee, so now it's petty season. Anyone involved goes straight on my blacklist for future purchases. You get a blacklist, and you get a blacklist, and because you tried extra hard, you also get a blacklist!

At a glance, I'm cancelling the 'Reincarnated as a Slime' order I had in, as that seems to be nuked all of a sudden, and I'll just assume every single series on MangaDex without chapters is a story written in salty manga publisher tears, and just avoid all of them wholesale.

It doesn't seem like Oshi no Ko, my current almost religious purchase on release day for every volume, is involved in any way here... seems that old chapters from before it got proper publishing is still live and well, so I assume I can still keep buying that guilt free, but do inform me if that too belongs in the trashpile. (Yes, I've read the ending online, and no, I don't mind it all that much, still love the series.)

## Why Manga fans pirate: A Field Guide

Manga isn't passive entertainment, it takes actual effort to consume. Reading, Tracking, Translating, sometimes decoding, like the worlds most absurd cryptographic puzzle. So, the fanbase is rather passionate and, apparently, masochistic. In hard times, people don't want to spend money unless they're assured that it's worth it, and companies don't seem to realize you can't squeeze blood from a broke stone.

#### Piracy is a Quality Check

If a series is easy to pirate, think scanlations everywhere, lively comment sections, minimal lag between releases, it's probably good. Piracy is the worlds most solid upvote. If you have to spelunk through the internet and find a blurry scan, pictured with a Nokia 3210 from 1999, maybe the series isn't worth the investment.

#### DMCA-happy companies are waving red flags

When a company carpet-bombs the internet with takedowns, all I see is insecurity and contempt for their audience. If you treat your Customers like enemies, don't be surprised when they return the favour.

##### Let's not forget:
- Kakao nuked Tachiyomi, which is like blaming Google for showing your recipes.
- In a recession, we all cut spending, especially on things that aren't vital. Manga is high effort, and is fighting for scraps against Netflix, Spotify, Crunchyroll and Youtube. I don't fancy its chances for most users in that battle.

#### Youth

Now, silly ol me, sitting here with a stable monthly payslip that allows for a reasonable cushion for entertainment, is not the only usecase here, enter the manga fans of tomorrow: Those balancing their entertainment needs against their Saturday candy and soda needs: Those under the age of 18 getting their $10 in allowance or whatever the sum is these days.

They are your longevity, the padding on your business plan. You either capture them, or you find yourself penniless, no ifs or buts about it. These Customers are ESSENTIAL for your long term health.

Yet, you're telling me that you would remove manga from their sight, and that even those pushing through should find your series online and decide that it's not worth looking at? Series loyalty built in the mid-teens is not ""neat"", it's the stuff that makes or breaks big franchises. Those series become part of their personality DNA, and they will not be shy in spending money on it as they gain the means to do so.

This has effectively killed off the longevity of seemingly thousands of series, and that's before taking into account that some percentage of these users may now be actively hostile to some publishers, which actively undermines future purchases.

## In conclusion

This is an amazingly short-sighted and self-destructive move, and I would probably fire my legal team if they were responsible, or get a new legal partner if they're not internal. This move has collectively cost you millions in the short term, and may actually have made your business plan unfeasible in the long term.

There isn't even the appearance of damage control here, no ""We've made our own platform where you can find what we just removed"", instead there's silence and tons of series removed that lack official translations, or are just not available at all in large parts of the world.

This is corporate dumb in a way that's uniquely positioned for chewing on a shotgun while playing with the trigger, great job.

I don't really have the patience to check up everyone involved in this mess, so I'll just assume that, when I check MangaDex prior to making a purchase, and I see no chapters, that its creators were involved in the DMCA or the manga is just not worth getting into, and find something else. And if I find the Kakao brand, or any subsidiaries, anywhere near a offering, I'll throw holy water on it and set it on fire before paying money in exchange for it.",16,1747593527.0,mangadex,8,0.91,False

I’ve never really been a book-smart person – I’ve always done better with hands-on, practical work. Here’s a bit about my journey so far:
	•	Studied culinary for 3 years.
	•	Worked as a cook for 4 years.
	•	Switched to being a waiter for 8 months – didn’t really enjoy it, just wanted to try something new.
	•	Became a barista for 18 months – actually liked it.
	•	Moved up to assistant manager, then back to waitressing for 4 months, and got offered a store manager role quickly. (The company appreciated my strengths: workflow, advertising, bringing recognition.)

But… I burnt out. Again.

I’ve been in a few leadership roles and honestly? Carrying teams has been exhausting – especially when dealing with younger Gen Z staff. Not throwing shade – they are hardworking – but they’re strong on their opinions. When they don’t like something, they just check out.

Some started disliking me after I implemented changes like:
	•	Dress code (no random outfits, minimal jewelry)
	•	No nail polish
	•	No phones at work (unless emergency)

The company backed me, but I still left burnt out. Same reason I left the kitchen – 8am to 10pm shifts, 5-6 days a week, with staffing always an issue. It took a toll physically and mentally.

Here’s the twist – I’ve always been drawn to the body art industry.
While studying culinary, I did a short tattoo apprenticeship but had to stop because of strict religious parents (Islam – tattoos are a no-go). Even back in middle school, I used to pierce myself and friends. Never got bad feedback or any infections.

Now, a piercing studio is offering me an apprenticeship. It’s unpaid, and I’d need to pick up part-time jobs to support myself while learning. At the same time, I’ve been offered another store manager position – stable pay, familiar territory, but also the same cycle I’ve been stuck in.

So here I am, torn.

I’ve wanted to leave the food industry for years. I’m tired. I’ve done everything from cooking to coffee to managing stores, but I keep hitting burnout.

I'm a mallu student here in Bangalore but from Kerala . I'm 19 and 6'4 tall, Fit but not muscular, almond eyes,black curly hair and brown in colour and down there I'm well groomed,uncut and 6.4 inches long

I am more interested in single women 18-45 who knows what they want rather than confusing me and themselves and wasting both our time. I prefer people who gets straight to the point. We can take it from there. Anyone who is from Bangalore is more preferred as I'm just a student who's let's say broke so can't be travelling to other cities without getting a job first. I live in South Bangalore around sg palaya/Taverekere area and I've been here for around 1.5 years.

I like ice creams, not a big fan of tea but I don't mind coffee, and i love home cooked meals. And i used to be an athlete i went for representing my state in football when I was in 12th. And I've been in some bad relationships and I'm currently in one but . She's not as kinky or has the same sex drive as me. That's why I'm trying to find who is open to being an fwb who knows what they want and who keeps our private life a secret and discreet.

Open to all kinds of kinks and fantasies such as: public teasing, romantic, Boob Play, Sneaky sex, mutual masturbation, Sweaty sex, tit slaps , clamps,Armpits,rimming,ddlg,light bondage,power switch,caring, affection,golden showers,age gap, age play etc and many taboo fantasies

Her boyfriend lives three hours away in another city. She goes to meet him every other weekend. She and I are very close at work. It started from having coffee breaks together, to hanging out after work, going out biking in the woods, exchanging our favourite novels and finally sharing about our personal lives. All through this time, I knew that I shouldn't develop feelings for her. Not just because I value our friendship, but also because she is a 8-year long relationship. 

Last evening, there was a party at a colleague's place. When I arrived, I saw that she was there with her boyfriend. This was the first time I'd seen him. I had not know he was going to be there. A horrible truth dawned on me when I realised I couldn't make conversation with him or even look him in the eyes for too long : I have feelings for her. For the rest of the evening, I sat in a corner by myself drinking, occasionally joining in the conversation to crack a joke but mostly keeping to myself. I hadn't gotten drunk in a long time. 

The guilt is killing me. I feel weak and useless. I don't know how to face her at work. She knew something was up at the party. She obviously found it odd that her friend was seemingly avoiding her boyfriend. I'm afraid of what will happen to our friendship.",4,1747593193.0,confessions,0,0.84,False

This caused me to be around this line cook that I found very attractive since day one. I remember during my interview I was being shown around the kitchen and he was there cooking dinner, I thought he was pretty cute.

At the time I was struggling with a restrictive eating disorder. Everyone just knew I was skinny so I would have priority in getting whatever food was left over at night lol. The line cook I liked would actually start making me food during the day to eat during my shift. I was always afraid I was overstepping by eating food, but no one ever said anything.

We eventually started talking through Facebook because we worked well together, he was a great coworker. And I just wanted to talk to him. 

After some time, I found out he liked me too. He dated for 3 years and I’m still in love with him. But due to us being in different stages of life we can’t see each other anymore. We will still talk. We found out that we were so much alike and I don’t think anyone understood me like him.

I no longer have an eating disorder and he made me lots of great food during our relationship. He insists on eating everything natural and that isn’t processed. At first I was skeptical of this, but he was right having food with natural/fresh ingredients obviously makes food taste so much better. 

I wish I would be with him but I’m trying to get a corporate job while he’s still a cook. I miss working with him. He is bossy at work when that really isn’t his personality at all 😆

Everytime I make coffee now, I miss how he would be upset if I used sweetener instead of plain sugar. He insisted it was terrible for me…

I was on TikTok and saw a video about the Law of Attraction (LOA). I’ve been in the manifestation community for a minute, so I know what it is, but it’s not something I’ve really leaned into. I kinda just went my own route.

But this video hit different. It was like, **“What you assume comes to you.”** Something about that wording clicked for me, so I hopped on ChatGPT and asked it to break it down. The response was basically, **“Like attracts like.”**

But then it gave me this whole detailed list on how to use it, and honestly, I was like, **“This is too much.”** I’m constantly on the move, and I forget to do all these little steps. So I asked, **“Can’t I just say, ‘I want a free cup of coffee’ and expect it to come?”** and it said yes!

And that got me thinking – **why do we make this so complicated?** Why do we overthink it? We should just state our desire and expect it to come in, the same way we know our names, birthdays, and that 1+1=2.

**AND THEN IT FINALLY HIT ME.**

I’ve been manifesting my SP for over a year and a half. It’s been a secure, mostly chill journey, and I’ve learned a lot about myself, but one thing I struggle with is the idea that he’ll never text me. I try not to put him on a pedestal, but if I’m constantly thinking, **“Why isn’t he texting me?”** then I kinda am.

But here’s the thing – **he’s just a guy.** A great guy, sure, but he’s not some untouchable god. He’s a normal human, just like me, just like you. So what’s the difference between him texting me and my best friend texting me? **There isn’t one.**

I realized I’m making this a bigger deal than it needs to be, and that energy is just keeping it from happening.

So today, I’m manifesting that free cup of coffee. I’m doing it until I figure it out. Because this is what people mean when they say to **“act as if”** – to live like your desire is already your reality.

When it does come in, it won’t feel like a big deal. It’ll just be part of my everyday life, the same way 1+1 will always be 2.

TL;DR: Stop overthinking manifestation. State what you want, trust it’s coming, and live your life. Your SP is just a person, not some untouchable god. Act as if it’s already yours",9,1747592972.0,manifestingSP,0,0.92,False

My husband will take care of the baby (he's the only person I have, I don't have any family & his family doesn't help us) so I can sleep from 9pm-12 or 1am, but idk if it's cause I'm older now or what, I absolutely cannot function on this little sleep.

Even trying to push myself to do chores I feel like I'm going to fall asleep standing up and doing tasks it's getting so bad.  My husband works on cars and it's pretty physically involved I'm assuming because he's also tired just by trying to stay up with the baby.  He works 12 hour days so it's just me here pretty much fighting for my life all day long.

He gets home around 6pm & we have so much to do during that time period that my only options are to go to bed around 8 or 9pm & sleep until he can't physically stand it anymore or force him to fight through his exhaustion to give me more hours? He doesn't handle lack of sleep well & gets somewhat unreliably tired even helping by staying up until 12 or 1.

Every night he doom-scrolled until dawn threatened, screen-lit eyes spider-veined and stinging. When the doctor called it “blue-light–induced insomnia,” Ethan laughed—how could light hurt you when it was the only thing awake?

At 3:17 a.m. on a Wednesday that felt welded to Tuesday, he shut the laptop, doused the desk lamp, and let the room settle. Darkness except for one tiny ember: the standby LED on his wall-mounted TV—perfect circle, pinprick red.

He blinked. The dot blinked back.

Too much caffeine, he decided, rolled onto his side, and drifted into a jittery half-sleep.

⸻

hey.
The voice scraped the inside of his skull like pencil on wood. Ethan snapped upright; the apartment remained black-still, except for the LED. The glow pulsed once, twice, synced to his heartbeat.

“Dreaming,” he croaked.

no, ethan. dreaming is when the movie plays without your name in the credits. this is different. i’m talking. listen.

He squeezed his eyes shut until constellations exploded behind the lids.

The dot brightened, painting the TV’s glass in crimson radar rings. Within the rings, static shapes flickered—screenshots of Ethan’s browsing history: news carnage, late-night conspiracy forums, ex-girlfriend profiles viewed from burner accounts. Each image flared then dissolved like film in acid.

“Stop.”

can’t. you fed me. i’m full of the things that keep you awake. time to return the favor.

A high-pitched tone bled from the speaker grills, drilling into nerves. Ethan lunged for the power cord, but it tugged free of his grasp—slithering deeper into the socket as though inhaled.

touch me again and i’ll show your mother your search terms.

The tone became words, overlapping, hundreds of voices reading aloud everything he’d ever typed into a search bar. Ethan slapped his palms over his ears; the voices seeped through skin.

He grabbed the nearest object—a ceramic coffee mug—and hurled it. The mug shattered against the screen, but the LED only flared brighter, shards reflecting its single eye.

good. break things. break yourself.

Ethan stumbled backward, tripping over tangled charging cables. The LED expanded, swallowing the bezel, until the entire display glowed deep arterial red. In its center floated a black cursor prompt:

   > \ _

Characters began to scroll without keystrokes: ethan enters the dark, ethan opens wider, ethan closes the door behind him—

A sudden hush fell. The LED winked out. Total darkness.

Ethan exhaled—then realized he couldn’t see the city glow under the doorframe, couldn’t hear the refrigerator motor. No sound, no light, no pulse in his own ears.

He tapped his phone screen. Nothing. He shouted, but the air swallowed the noise like wet cotton.

On the TV, the red dot re-ignited—inside the glass, far deeper than before. Ethan saw his reflection, pale and silent, staring from the other side of the screen. The cursor flashed beneath the mirror-image’s chin:

1kpqmwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MigraineHeadacheHacks/comments/1kpqmwj/tricks_ive_picked_up/,Tricks I've picked up,"Just sharing because we all need little things to help when a migraine hits.

Consider switching to a round/roll cervical neck pillow. It was an adjustment with some aches and pains the first couple days but I am no longer waking up with migraine inducing neck pain. Also fixed some of my back discomfort!

Peppermint -- I keep an essential oil bottle for sniffing and little candies in my purse. They help quite a bit.

On the note of essential oils, several companies carry headache specific blends. I'm not the type to peddle oils for everything/over medicine. But these do help. At very least they loosen some of the tension. I usually go for the temples, between the eyes and the upper orbital socket if presenting in the eyes (careful not to get in the eyes/go sparingly because it likes to spread and ow!), the base of the skull/upper neck. Only brands I've tried are DoTerra's Tension Ease (because Mom falls for ever MLM known to man, lol) and Wyndmere's headache blend (briefly worked for them in shipping but the powerful smell when some blends were being made was triggering).

Johnson's Soothing Vapor bodywash. Probably works in a similar vein to inhaling/eating peppermint but the tipster I picked this up from swears that using it regularly has reduced her migraines. Can't confirm on this yet myself.

Hot and Cold:

--  Stick your feet in as hot of water as you can stand (don't burn yourself!). Something about redirecting circulation. For some people this supposedly stops the migraine/headache all together? But in my case it just dials back the intensity. Nice for some relief though.
 
-- I've heard heating up your head opens up the blood vessels that are constricted during a migraine and offers relief/can break the migraine but I haven't had a ton of success with this? Could 100% be a flaw in my attempts. Full body hot bath to submerge my head resulted in vomiting. And I've tried both a blowdryer and one of those old head dome driers (mom's a beautician). I think I experienced some relief but the noise was awful. 

-- Ice cube/ice pack on the base of the skull/upper neck and temples. 

Dealing with vomiting:

-- My sister used to party and turned me on to drinking a carbonated beverage. Seems to work but if you're like me and also have gut/bloating issues because migraines, not my favorite hack. 

-- Canned fruit in heavy syrup. I swear by this. Doesn't matter what fruit (except dark cherries didn't work for me and was traumatic coming back up for my concerned roomie) and MUST be in heavy syrup, because it's the heavy syrup you're gonna drink. I've been seconds from vomiting and chugged a can and instantly felt better. I always keep cans stocked now. 

Things of note from doctor failings:

--  It took years to get a doctor who thought to tell me that I should be switching off taking over the counter and prescribed meds for onset migraine attacks. Because apparently taking the same thing every time can increase your migraines. 

-- I don't know why/didn't think to ask but doctor advised away from migraine specific over counter meds like Excedrin. Mine suggested 2 tabs of Alieve and it seems to work. 

-- If you're on Toperimate, it reduces your potassium levels and you NEED to actively counter act this. I THINK it's something like 4 servings a day? My first neurologist neglected to tell me this and I got very sick and didn't know why. My second neurologist stressed the importance and gave me a packet detailing how much to consume and dietary sources. If your doctor hasn't detailed this 1. Consider a new doctor and 2. Ask ASAP. 

On the note of Toperimate and Potassium:

-- Don't just go off of my suggested servings. I'm suggesting off memory and my memory is shit (brain damage). Consult a doctor.

-- Whatever the correct serving is, if your go to is bananas, that's a lot of bananas a day, every day. Just no. There's a lot of recommended sources.

Potassium Source:  Chia Seeds

-- The best I've found is chia seeds. Supposedly holy basil seeds are even richer in potassium and other nutrients but someone told me they have a strong unpleasant taste, so haven't tried it.

--  I think 3 to 4 TBLS was within or above my recommended counter balance (4 TBLS being the highest recommended in daily consumption).

-- Always ALWAYS hydrate chia seeds before consumption! You could cause a blockage in your intestines if you don't! I throw them in a jar and top generously with water, give it a thorough shake and pop it in the fridge the night before but for quicker use I think you only need a few hours (Google it) and I've noticed you can reduce wait time if you use hot water (don't know if this hurts nutritional value though).


-- There's all kinds of ways to consume it. Hydrate and add sugar/flavoring for pudding. Add to drinks like mini Boba. A favorite when I was younger was to sweeten and flavor milk and add it to that. 

-- That said, the amount you need to consume is a lot and I was struggling to get it all down this way. I started with 4 TBLSP and reduced to 3 and was even struggling to do it every day then. Then one day I had the bright idea to throw the dry seeds through a coffee grinder and then hydrate. This made consumption on that level SO MUCH easier for some reason. Maybe it's the finer texture? Idk. Drink wise this makes it closer to a smoothie than tiny heavy Boba. This version is easy to throw in your eggs or just treat the same as you would oatmeal or heck, add to your oatmeal. Also good in fried oatmeal (you can fry your oatmeal guys, it's so good!).

That's all I've got so far. If I learn anything new I'll post again. But do tell me your tips and tricks! Always looking for more.",4,1747592462.0,MigraineHeadacheHacks,2,1.0,False

 I’m sorry I did not put up Saturday or Sunday quotes and songs of the day. I got my stitches out on Thursday. And although that is feeling really great. I’m still having a connection error between my nose and ear. Sooooo I have to do a CT scan asap this week. Followed by two ENT appointments. It 90% will all point to having another surgery to correct the connection error. That’s the only way to fix it. It won’t resolve on its own. Been feeling a bit sad the last 2-3 days but it’s okay. Nothing I can’t handle.

For my Sunday.. I’m going take a lovely nature walk, by the river. I will be journaling today and doing some art in my journal. I love making it all pretty 🥰 before I write in it. Hmm what else. Going to do some self care tasks 😍. And then finally, read a graphic novel I’ve been really looking forward to. While I read, I’ll be opening the windows.. listening to the birds and neighbors, putting on my decor lights and a cup of decaf coffee.

i miss you all the time. i wonder if you ever think about me sometimes too. i haven’t spoken to you since our friend group split. life was so much easier when we were kids, i miss our sleepovers, trick or treating for the king sized candy bars till midnight, playing volleyball and cheerleading together over the years. do you remember playing just dance? our matching jb t shirts? our laughter? 

i think the stress of being popular and sitting with the crowd appealed to us both more than our years of friendship. we didn’t verbally express anything. we just lost touch and never spoke again. it was always effortless for us though. we never fought. we never had issues. but you followed the crowd you thought was more appealing just as i did. we found our own groups and i still have these close friends, but i wonder what we could’ve achieved together if things went differently.

we’re all grown up now. i wonder if your parents ask about me too, they were always so kind to me. mine ask about you or wonder what you’re up to these days. maybe we can meet up for coffee and donuts one day or something, if you still love donuts like you used to. i’d love to hear from you peach, i hope you’re doing okay.

My doctor told me to lose weight, quit drinking alcohol, add more fibre into my diet and exercise. He prescribed me blood pressure medication for mild hypertension and ozempic for weightloss. I lost 42 pounds, about 1-3 lbs a week, I started drinking vega protein powder with 140 g of frozen strawberries, 250 ml vanilla oat milk and water smoothies for my breakfast, I drink a cup of metamucil 3 times a day once before each meal. I started walking 7-8 k steps a day. My ALT levels went from a 54 - 140. 54 was when I drank alcohol often, ate fast every day, didn't workout and I weighed about 186 lbs, I'm 5'3"". Now ALT is 144, I weigh 144 lbs and I eat a better diet. I just don't understand why it's so high, it's giving me anxiety.

I spoke with a dietitian, she said sugar, saturated fat, alcohol are not good for liver health. She looked at my protein powder ingredients and said that my protein powder is good, my metamucil is good, I do drink coffee (once every day in the morning for as long as I can remember)

Since being on ozempic, I don't crave or eat fast food anymore and I avoid anything sugary because of the side effects. Like I mentioned before, I drink protein in the morning for my breakfast, at lunch I eat salads with chicken breast. Supper I eat home cooked meals,

The good news? You don’t have to freak out anymore. **Enter AI**—your new best friend in the content game! 🎉

Let’s dive into how to harness the power of AI for creating content like a pro, without sacrificing your sanity. Seriously, who needs to work harder when you can work smarter, right? Here’s a simple roadmap to get you started:

### 1. **Understand What AI Can Do**
   - **Content Generation**: From blogs to social media posts, AI can whip up text faster than you can say “writer’s block.”
   - **Idea Generation**: Stuck in a rut? AI tools can brainstorm topics or angles you haven’t even thought of!
   - **Editing & Proofreading**: Say goodbye to embarrassing typos. AI can polish your writing to a shine! ✨

### 2. **Pick Your Preferred Tools**
   - **ChatGPT**: This is a fun tool for creating conversational content. You can ask it anything, and it’ll respond like a buddy who’s got your back.
   - **Copy.ai or Jasper**: These are fantastic for generating marketing copy or product descriptions. It’s like having a copywriter who never sleeps (or asks for coffee breaks).
   - **Grammarly**: Think of it as your writing sidekick, nudging you toward better grammar and style.

### 3. **Set Clear Goals**
   - **Define Your Needs**: Are you looking for a daily blog post or catchy social media captions? Knowing what you need helps you pick the right tool.
   - **Create Templates**: Design basic templates that outline the structure you want. AI can fill in the blanks!

### 4. **Give It a Shot!**
   - Try out a tool to generate a draft. Let’s be real; it won’t be perfect on the first go, but who is? 😊 
   - **Edit With Style**: Use the AI draft as your foundation. Infuse your voice and personality. Remember, it’s not about replacing you, it’s about enhancing what you already do!
   
### Just a Little Note...
Don’t underestimate **the power of personality**. It’s tempting to lean on AI for everything, but remember—it’s a tool, not a replacement. Your unique voice is what will truly resonate with your audience. Wouldn’t want them getting a robot instead of a relatable human, right?

### Here’s a Fun Challenge:
Try creating an entire blog post using AI, and then see how much you can personalize it afterward. Did you find it easier? Did it spark some wild new ideas? 

Let’s keep cheering each other on as we navigate this digital creativity landscape. Remember, the goal is to save time, reduce stress, and still produce awesome content. The AI revolution is here, and it’s pretty friendly! 🚀

Initially before I got the job I was going to move home to save money for a house so when she graduates she and I can go live in our dream area (down south) but she kept pressuring me to stay in the area by guilt tripping me constantly. So I managed to pick up a job at the correctional facility working overnights so I had a steady income for an apartment that I carry 70% of the expenses for. When I got the job I told her that I would try to sleep with her on the weekends as she is a big cuddler and wanted her cuddles. But as I’ve gotten into a flow of things 5 months on the job it’s getting harder and harder to keep adjusting my sleep schedule for weekends. I work 11p-7a and normally sleep 8a-5p (I drop her off at work and then go sleep). On weekend she guilt trips me into trying to sleep at 11p until about 8a. I normally am awake during this time until 4a. I lay there and do nothing which is really hard for me as I have pretty bad adhd and my body has adjusted this time as peak awake hours.

Today I asked her if she could try to adjust her schedule to mine or at least modify it. Because of how screwed my schedule is I pooped out around 8p and woke up at 4a. She went to bed with me at the same time. I asked if she could get up with me at that time to which she kicked me out to the living room where I watched YouTube for 2 hours. I then asked her to go get coffee with me thinking 10 hours of sleep was enough. She told me no and go get it by myself. 

Later we got in a fight at Walmart of all places about how the arrangement is and how I felt it was unfair. She was not having it and passive aggressive solutions trying to guilt trip me again. This time I went with it. 

F21 “I’ll sleep on the couch so you can keep your sleep schedule and play video games at night”

M22 “I’d rather you sleep in bed and me on the couch or on the air mattress in the second bedroom” 

As well as other stuff along those lines. I’m typing this kind of short because she’s in the other room giving me the silent treatment but I don’t want her thinking I’m texting my mom about this. (I live far away and my mom is my rock) so feel free to ask questions and I can give more details. I don’t think she’s on Reddit but just in case that’s also why I kept it short.

Side note (more context she hasn’t come out much)— She also claims that I mention my sleep schedule being fucked up every week because of her request. Which I do but I feel it’s justified as sleep is essential to my functioning as a human being. And since I’ve graduated college and have taken a hard stop on energy drinks 8 hours out of 36 hours for sleep is not a good ratio for me to function any longer. ",1,1747592270.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

Knights hold the frontline, they're meat walls, keep the ennemy at bay, and in some way can deal huge damage and crowd control.
 
Footmen are the helpers of the Knights. They have better crowd control than Knights, better range, and can place barricades and spikes to help the frontline even more. They need to play the objectives as they're a mix between front and backlines.
 
Vanguards are assassins. They pick off the most valuable players with their huge damage, take on the ennemy backlines, and help surround the ennemy frontline from the back.
 
---
 
And then, there's the Archer.
 
The Archer is a support role. With the simple bow, they rain down arrows on the ennemies, forcing them to either focus on the arrows and risk getting hit by the rest of the team, or focus on the rest of the team and getting shot at.
 
The warbow, with its longer range, act as a counter-archer, one shotting the ennemy Archers to the body, helping the Vanguards in their task. It can also head-hunt for the weakened and the wounded.
 
The crossbow's focus is on head-hunting. You pick off targets from mid range, focusing either Archers, Footmen, or Knights. Its relatively good damage but slow reload requires precision to also not waste your carrels on teammates.
 
The siege crossbow is basically the same, but you target ballistas, catapults, etc etc.

Then Skirmisher is there to offer either protection to your fellow Archers and other backliners from Vanguards and other flankers, or you offer close ranged support to your frontline by picking off threats with your huge damage (120 dmg from Jav headshot), or you go with the Vanguards and help with flanking the ennemy team.
 
---
 
Archers are valuable, treat them nice, offer them coffee, maybe tea, because they help you.
 
On a more serious note, ever noticed how a team composed of only Knights and Vanguards usually leads to a defeat? Or too many Footmen? Well, a lack of good (and I mean, GOOD) Archers often leads to slow burn defeats, leaving a sour taste in the mouth (especially when the Vanguards don't do a good job).
 
---
 
I'm by no mean a good player, maybe only average, with only a few hours in, and I'm honestly not an Archer player myself, and this is only based after my observations and analyse, so yeah if you wanna add something or whatever, do as you please.

Please enjoy!,"Here is my M8 Tracker album, ""The Color of Television"", inspired by my favorite science fiction novel, Neuromancer by William Gibson.   It’s been something of a passion project I’ve been meaning to make for a long time and it just turned 1 year old.  It was created entirely on a Dirtywave M8 Tracker (that little cyberdeck looking thing in the video).  It fuses 90s drumnbass and jungle with chiptune and demoscene inspired elements.  

Check it out on Bandcamp here (it’s free) ~ https://disposableplanet.bandcamp.com/album/the-color-of-television

It’s also on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.  

This album is dedicated to my parents, Ralph & Sandra.  RIP and infinite love.  

From the YouTube description…

ABOUT THE ALBUM:

This album, The Color of Television, is a passion project I’ve been meaning to make for years. It is a love letter to my favorite book and what I consider to be the greatest science-fiction novel of all time…

William Gibson’s Neuromancer.

The Color of Television was created in a creative frenzy over a period of 10 days. It is structured across 14 tracks, each representing a sharpened tip on a pair of 7-pointed shuriken or Japanese throwing stars (a gift which represents destiny for the main character of the novel). Each of these 14 nodes or points contains a song and a story for a different main character featured in the book (yep, even Ratz is in there somewhere as a DJ).

Neuromancer is the first novel to put the literary genre of Cyberpunk on the map, but this album is not created in the style of modern cyberpunk music or synthwave.  Simply put, those current musical genres are after my time. Instead I’ve deliberately drawn from my own personal meaning of the retro-future written about in Neuromancer, as well as the nascent computer culture of the time and its collision with the counterculture surrounding it and myself when I first read the novel in 1996 at the age of fifteen.

As a result, this album is a voyage across all the things that Neuromancer means to me and how it affected my coming of age and acted as a rite of passage into the shifting and colliding worlds of computers, music, and culture.

The album draws from mid to late 1990s influences of the time of my reading and the world of the 2000s that I would, in a few years, be stepping into. It borrows from genres like drumnbass, jungle, and breakbeat, with of course, a healthy fix of demoscene vibes and chiptune elements and a decent hit of punk, metal, ambient, and post-punk flavor. I think you’ll find there is plenty of retrofuturistic feeling to geek out to in this release along with a slight touch of the contemporary.

I hope you enjoy this album as much as I enjoyed making it. I also hope that, for a time, it helps you escape this prison of flesh you are forever trapped in, as Case might say.

Thank you for listening and for all the support!

The truth about the caller was something else entirely.," I’m a 911 operator. I work the graveyard shift, 11 PM to 7 AM. You hear a lot of things in this job. A lot of pain, a lot of fear, a lot of just… weirdness. But usually, there’s an explanation. Usually, it fits into a box, however grim that box might be.

This one… this one doesn’t fit in any box I know. And it’s been eating at me for weeks. I need to get it out. I’ve changed some minor details to protect privacy, but the core of it, the part that keeps me up when I finally get home, that’s all here.

It was a Tuesday, or technically Wednesday morning, around 2:30 AM. The witching hour, some call it. For us, it’s usually just the quiet before the post-bar-closing storm, or the time when the truly desperate calls come in. The air in the dispatch center was stale, smelling faintly of lukewarm coffee and the ozone hum of too many electronics. My screen glowed with the CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch) system, mostly green – all quiet. I was idly tracing the condensation ring my water bottle left on the desk, trying to stay alert.

Then a call dropped into my queue. Standard ring. I clicked to answer.

“911, what is the address of your emergency?” Standard opening. My voice was calm, practiced.

The other end was quiet for a beat, just a ragged, shallow breath. Then, a woman’s voice, tight and trembling. “I… I don’t know if this is an emergency. I think… I think I’m going crazy.”

Not an uncommon start, especially at this hour. Loneliness, paranoia, sometimes undiagnosed mental health issues. “Okay, ma’am, can you tell me what’s happening? And I still need your address so I know where you are.”

“Yes, yes, of course. It’s… 1427 Hawthorn Lane.” Her voice was thin. “My name is… well, that doesn’t matter right now, does it?”

I typed the address into the system. Popped up clean. Residential. “Okay, 1427 Hawthorn Lane. Got it. Tell me what’s going on, ma’am.”

“There’s… there’s someone in my wardrobe.”

My internal ‘check a box’ system clicked. Possible home invasion. Or, again, paranoia. “Someone in your wardrobe? Are you sure? Have you seen them?”

“No, not… not seen. Heard.” She took a shaky breath. “It started about an hour ago. A knocking sound. From inside my bedroom wardrobe.”

“A knocking sound?” I prompted, keeping my tone even. “Could it be pipes? An animal in the walls?” The usual rationalizations.

“No, no, it’s not like that. It’s… deliberate. Like someone tapping to get out. I thought… I thought I was dreaming, or just hearing things. You know, old house sounds. But it kept happening. Tap… tap-tap… tap.” She mimicked it, and even through the phone line, the distinct rhythm was unsettling.

“Are you alone in the house, ma'am?”

“Yes. Completely alone. My husband… he passed away last year.” Her voice hitched a little on that. I made a mental note. Grief can do strange things to the mind.

“I’m very sorry for your loss, ma’am.” I said, genuinely. “This knocking, did you try to investigate it?”

“I… I was too scared at first. I just lay in bed, pulling the covers up. But it wouldn’t stop. It just kept going. So, eventually, I got up. I turned on the light. I went to the wardrobe.”

Her breathing was getting faster. I could hear the faint rustle of fabric, like she was wringing her hands or clutching her clothes.

“And what happened when you got to the wardrobe, ma’am?”

“The knocking stopped when I got close. And then… then I heard a voice.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “A little boy’s voice. It said, ‘Help me. Please, help me. I’m trapped.’”

A chill, faint but definite, traced its way down my spine. This was… different. “A boy’s voice? From inside the wardrobe?”

“Yes! He sounded so scared. He said… he said his daddy put him in there and he can’t get out.”

Okay. This was escalating. A child’s voice claiming to be trapped by his father. This had moved past ‘old house sounds.’ But still, the details were… odd. A child just appearing in a wardrobe?

“Ma’am, did you open the wardrobe door?”

“Yes! As soon as he said that, I threw it open. I was expecting… I don’t know what I was expecting. But there was nothing there.” Her voice cracked with a mixture of fear and confusion. “Just my clothes. Shoes on the floor. Nothing. And the voice… it was gone. Silence.”

“Nothing at all?” I clarified. “No sign of anyone, no way a child could be hiding?”

“No! It’s not a deep wardrobe. You’d see. I even pushed clothes aside. It was empty. I thought… I must have imagined it. The stress, being alone…”

“And what happened then?” I asked, leaning forward slightly. My other hand was hovering over the dispatch button, but I needed more. This felt… off. Not like a prank. Prank callers usually have a different energy, a smugness or a forced panic. This woman sounded genuinely terrified and bewildered.

“I… I was so relieved, but also so confused. I stood there for a minute, trying to catch my breath. Then I closed the wardrobe door.” She paused, and I could hear a sharp intake of air. “And the second it latched… the knocking started again. Louder this time. And the little boy’s voice. ‘Please! Don’t leave me in here! He’ll be angry if he finds out I was talking!’”

Her voice broke into a sob. “I don’t know what to do! I’m so scared. Is it a ghost? Am I losing my mind? But it sounds so real!”

I took a slow breath myself. My skepticism was warring with a growing sense of unease. The sequence of events was bizarre, but her terror felt authentic. “Okay, ma’am. Stay on the line with me. You’re in your bedroom now?”

“No, I ran out. I’m in the living room. I locked the bedroom door. But I can still… I can still faintly hear it. The knocking.”

“Is the wardrobe in your master bedroom?”

“Yes, the big one. Oh God, he’s talking again.” Her voice was hushed, urgent. “He’s saying… he’s saying his dad locked him in because he was a ‘bad boy.’ He said his dad gets really mad and… and hurts him sometimes.”

That was it. That specific detail – the abuse allegation. Whether this was a delusion, a ghost, or something else entirely, if there was even a fraction of a chance a child was in danger, we had to act. My fingers flew across the keyboard, initiating a dispatch for a welfare check, possibly a child endangerment situation. I coded it high priority.

“Ma’am, I’m sending officers to your location right now, okay? They’re going to check this out. I need you to stay on the phone with me.”

“They’re coming? Oh, thank God. Thank you.” Relief flooded her voice, but the undercurrent of terror remained. “He’s… he’s crying now. The little boy. He’s saying his dad told him if he made any noise, he’d be in for it. He says he’s scared of the dark.”

I relayed the additional information to the responding units. “Caller states she can hear a child’s voice from a wardrobe, claiming his father locked him in and abuses him. Child is reportedly scared and crying.”

The dispatcher on the radio acknowledged. “Units en route. ETA six minutes.”

Six minutes can feel like an eternity on a call like this. I tried to keep her talking, to keep her grounded. “Ma’am, what’s your name?”

“It’s… it’s Eleanor. Eleanor Vance.”

“Okay, Eleanor. The officers are on their way. Are you somewhere you feel safe right now?”

“I’m in the living room, like I said. I have the door locked. But the sound… it’s like it’s getting clearer, even from here. Or maybe I’m just listening harder.” She paused. “He’s saying… ‘Daddy says I shouldn’t talk to strangers. But you’re not a stranger if you’re helping, are you?’”

My blood ran cold. The innocence of that, juxtaposed with the implied threat… it was deeply disturbing. “Are you talking to him?""
I asked her

""No, it's just, i can hear him so clearly, i dont know how he is talking to me from upstairs, it just like he can hear me talking to you . Maybe i shouldn't have came down, maybe i should go back to the room"" 

""No, Eleanor stay where you are. You’re helping. And we’re helping too. Wait for the dispatch please”

I could hear her quiet, fearful breathing. I focused on the CAD screen, watching the little car icons representing the patrol units crawl across the map towards Hawthorn Lane. Each tick of the clock in the dispatch center sounded unnaturally loud.

“Eleanor,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “when the officers arrive, they’ll knock. Let them know it’s you, okay?”

“Yes, yes, I will.” She was quiet for a moment, then, “He’s saying thank you. The little boy. He says he hopes they come soon because it’s hard to breathe in here.”

Hard to breathe. My stomach clenched. That detail was chillingly specific. Ventilation in a closed wardrobe wouldn’t be great.

“They’re almost there, Eleanor. Just a couple more minutes.”

“Unit 214, show us on scene at 1427 Hawthorn.” The voice of Officer Miller crackled through my headset.

“Copy that, 214. Caller is Eleanor Vance, should be expecting you. She’s in the living room, reports hearing a child in a wardrobe in the master bedroom.”

“10-4, Central.”

I relayed this to Eleanor. “They’re there, Eleanor. They’re at your door.”

“Oh, thank heavens.” I heard a faint shuffling sound, as if she was getting up. Then, nothing for a few seconds. I expected to hear her talking to the officers, the sound of a door opening.

Instead, Officer Miller’s voice came back on the radio, sounding puzzled. “Central, we have a male subject at the door. Advises he’s the homeowner.”

My brow furrowed. “A male subject? Ask him if Eleanor Vance is present. Or if there’s any female resident.”

A brief pause. “Central, negative. Male states he lives here alone with his son. Says there’s no Eleanor Vance here, no female resident at all.”

A cold dread, far deeper than before, began to spread through me. I looked at the address on my screen. 1427 Hawthorn Lane. Confirmed. “Eleanor?” I said into the phone. “Eleanor, are you there? The officers are saying a man answered the door. They say there’s no woman there.”

Her voice came back, faint and laced with utter confusion. “What? No… that’s impossible. I’m here. This is my house. I’m… I’m looking out the living room window. I can see the patrol car.”

“Unit 214,” I said, my voice tight, “caller on the line insists she is inside the residence, states she can see your vehicle.” This was getting stranger by the second.

“Central, the male subject is adamant. He’s looking pretty confused himself, says no one else should be here.” Miller sounded wary. “Says his name is Arthur Collins. He’s got ID.”

“Eleanor,” I pressed, “what does this man look like? The one at the door?”

“I… I can’t see him clearly from here. Just… just his shape.” Her voice was trembling violently now. “But this is my house! I’ve lived here for twenty years! My husband, Robert… we bought it together.”

“214, the caller’s name is Eleanor Vance. She says her late husband was Robert. Does the name vance mean anything to mr collins?”

I waited, listening to the silence on Eleanor’s end, then Miller’s response. “Central, Mr. Collins says he bought this house three years ago. From an estate sale. Previous owner was deceased. A Robert Vance.”

My heart hammered against my ribs. Estate sale. Previous owner deceased. Robert Vance. That meant… Eleanor Vance…

“Eleanor?” I said softly. “The officer said Mr. Collins bought the house three years ago, from the estate of a Robert Vance. Eleanor… your husband’s name was Robert, you said.”

There was a long, drawn-out silence on her end. Just the sound of her breathing, growing more ragged, more panicked. It sounded like she was hyperventilating.

“Eleanor, can you hear me?”

Then, a choked sound. “No… no, that can’t be right. Robert… he passed last year. Not… not three years ago. I… I was with him.” Her voice was dissolving into confusion and fear. “This is… this is my home.”

This was spiraling out of my control, out of any recognizable scenario. But the child… the child was still the priority.

“Unit 214,” I said, pushing down my own disorientation. “Regardless of the caller’s status, the initial report was a child trapped in a wardrobe, possibly abused. Mr. Collins states he has a son. You need to verify the welfare of that child.”

“10-4, Central. Mr. Collins confirms he has a seven-year-old son, says his name is Leo. Says he’s asleep upstairs.”

“Ask him if you can see the boy, just to confirm he’s okay, given the nature of the call we received.”

There was a pause. I could hear Miller talking to Collins, muffled. Then Miller came back on. “Central, subject is refusing. Says the boy is fine, doesn’t want him woken up. He’s getting a bit agitated.”

“Eleanor,” I whispered into my phone, “are you still there?”
A faint, broken sound, like a gasp. “I… I don’t understand what’s happening…”

“214, reiterate that due to the specifics of the call, we need to see the child. It’s a welfare check.” My training kicked in. We had cause.

More muffled conversation, then Miller’s voice, sharper now. “Central, subject is becoming uncooperative. Denying access. He’s raising his voice.” Then, a sudden change in his tone. “Hold on… Central, did you hear that?”

“Hear what, 214?”

“A sound. From upstairs. Faint… like a cry. Or a thump.”

My gut twisted. “Eleanor,” I said quickly, “the wardrobe you heard the knocking from, which room is it in?”

“The… the master bedroom,” she whispered. “Upstairs. At the end of the hall.”

“214, the original report specified the master bedroom wardrobe, upstairs. Did you hear the sound from that direction?”

“Affirmative, Central. Definitely from upstairs. Subject is now trying to block the doorway. Partner is moving to restrain.”

The line with Eleanor was still open. I could hear her ragged, panicked gasps. It was like listening to someone drowning.

Then, chaos erupted on the radio. Shouting. “Sir, step aside!” “Police! Don’t resist!” Sounds of a struggle. My own pulse was roaring in my ears. I gripped the phone tighter.

“Central, we’re making entry to check on the child!” Officer Miller’s voice, strained. “Subject is non-compliant.”

I heard footsteps pounding on the radio feed, officers moving quickly. “Upstairs! Check the bedrooms!”

Eleanor was making soft, whimpering sounds now. “They’re in my house… but they can’t see me… Robert… what’s happening to me, Robert?”

“214, status?” I demanded.

“Checking rooms… Master bedroom at the end of the hall… Door’s closed…” A pause, then, “It’s locked.”

“Eleanor, was your bedroom door locked when you left it?”

“Yes… yes, I locked it,” she stammered.

“214, caller states she locked that door.”

“Okay, Central. We’re announcing, then forcing if no response.” I heard them call out, “Police! Occupant, open the door!” Silence. Then a thud, another. The sound of a door splintering.

“We’re in!” Miller shouted. “Wardrobe… it’s closed… Oh God. Central, we found him. Child in the wardrobe. He’s alive! Conscious, but terrified. Small boy, matches the description.”

A wave of dizzying relief washed over me, so strong it almost buckled me. He was real. The boy was real. They got to him. Arthur Collins was now in deep, deep trouble.

But then the other part of it crashed back in. Eleanor.

“Eleanor?” I said, my voice hoarse. “They found him. The little boy, Leo. He’s safe. They have him.”

Her response was a broken whisper, almost inaudible. “Leo… his name is Leo… He was… he was real…”

“Yes, Eleanor, he was real. But… the officers… they still don’t see you. Mr. Collins says you’re not there. Eleanor… where are you in the house right now?”

A long, shaky sigh. “I’m… I was in the living room. By the window. But… when they came in… they walked right past me. Right through where I was standing.” Her voice was filled with a dawning, unutterable horror. “They didn’t… they didn’t see me. He didn’t see me.”

“Eleanor…” I didn’t know what to say. What could I possibly say?

“The wardrobe… the master bedroom… that’s where I heard him so clearly. I spent so much time in that room… after Robert…” Her voice trailed off. Then, a new note of terror, colder than before. “If… if Mr. Collins bought the house three years ago… from Robert’s estate… and Robert died… then… when did I die?”

The question hung in the air, chilling me to the bone. I had no answer. My dispatcher’s manual had no protocol for this.

“I… I don’t feel anything,” she whispered, her voice sounding distant now, frayed. “It’s… it’s like I’m fading. I can’t… I can’t see the room clearly anymore. It’s… cold.”

“Eleanor? Eleanor, stay with me! Can you tell me anything else? Can you describe what you see around you now?” My professional instincts were useless, grasping at straws.

Her voice was barely a breath. “Just… dark… and wind… so much wind…”

Then, a click. The line went dead.

“Eleanor?” I yelled into the receiver. “Eleanor!”

Static.

My hand was shaking as I hit the redial button for the incoming number. It rang. Once. Twice. Then it connected.

But there was no voice. Just a sound. A faint, hollow, whistling sound, like wind blowing through a cracked windowpane, or across the mouth of an empty bottle. It was a sound I’d heard before, sometimes on bad connections, but this was different. This felt… empty. Desolate.

I listened for a full minute, my heart pounding, a cold sweat on my brow. The sound didn’t change. Just that soft, sighing wind.

I hung up.

The officers were dealing with Collins, getting medics for Leo. The immediate crisis was over. The boy was safe. That’s what mattered. That’s what I told myself.

But Eleanor…

I ran the number through our system again. It was a landline, registered to 1427 Hawthorn Lane. It had been for over twenty years. Registered to Robert and Eleanor Vance. It was probably disconnected after the estate sale, but somehow… somehow she had called from it. Or through it.


The report I filed was… complex. I focused on the tangible: the call, the child endangerment, the successful rescue. I omitted the parts about Eleanor’s apparent non-existence, her dawning realization. Who would believe it? They’d send me for psych eval. Maybe I should go.

But I know what I heard. I know how real her fear was. And I know that, whatever she was, she saved that little boy’s life. She reached across… whatever barrier separates us from whatever she is… and she made us listen.

I still work the midnight shift. The calls still come in. But now, sometimes, when there’s a strange silence on the line, or a whisper I can’t quite make out, I feel a different kind of chill. I think of Eleanor Vance, and the hollow wind on the other end of the line.

1kpqgra,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kpqgra/im_a_911_operator_the_call_about_the_boy_in_the/,I'm a 911 operator. The call about the boy in the wardrobe was horrifying. The truth about the caller was something else entirely.," I’m a 911 operator. I work the graveyard shift, 11 PM to 7 AM. You hear a lot of things in this job. A lot of pain, a lot of fear, a lot of just… weirdness. But usually, there’s an explanation. Usually, it fits into a box, however grim that box might be.

This one… this one doesn’t fit in any box I know. And it’s been eating at me for weeks. I need to get it out. I’ve changed some minor details to protect privacy, but the core of it, the part that keeps me up when I finally get home, that’s all here.

It was a Tuesday, or technically Wednesday morning, around 2:30 AM. The witching hour, some call it. For us, it’s usually just the quiet before the post-bar-closing storm, or the time when the truly desperate calls come in. The air in the dispatch center was stale, smelling faintly of lukewarm coffee and the ozone hum of too many electronics. My screen glowed with the CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch) system, mostly green – all quiet. I was idly tracing the condensation ring my water bottle left on the desk, trying to stay alert.

Then a call dropped into my queue. Standard ring. I clicked to answer.

“911, what is the address of your emergency?” Standard opening. My voice was calm, practiced.

The other end was quiet for a beat, just a ragged, shallow breath. Then, a woman’s voice, tight and trembling. “I… I don’t know if this is an emergency. I think… I think I’m going crazy.”

Not an uncommon start, especially at this hour. Loneliness, paranoia, sometimes undiagnosed mental health issues. “Okay, ma’am, can you tell me what’s happening? And I still need your address so I know where you are.”

“Yes, yes, of course. It’s… 1427 Hawthorn Lane.” Her voice was thin. “My name is… well, that doesn’t matter right now, does it?”

I typed the address into the system. Popped up clean. Residential. “Okay, 1427 Hawthorn Lane. Got it. Tell me what’s going on, ma’am.”

“There’s… there’s someone in my wardrobe.”

My internal ‘check a box’ system clicked. Possible home invasion. Or, again, paranoia. “Someone in your wardrobe? Are you sure? Have you seen them?”

“No, not… not seen. Heard.” She took a shaky breath. “It started about an hour ago. A knocking sound. From inside my bedroom wardrobe.”

“A knocking sound?” I prompted, keeping my tone even. “Could it be pipes? An animal in the walls?” The usual rationalizations.

“No, no, it’s not like that. It’s… deliberate. Like someone tapping to get out. I thought… I thought I was dreaming, or just hearing things. You know, old house sounds. But it kept happening. Tap… tap-tap… tap.” She mimicked it, and even through the phone line, the distinct rhythm was unsettling.

“Are you alone in the house, ma'am?”

“Yes. Completely alone. My husband… he passed away last year.” Her voice hitched a little on that. I made a mental note. Grief can do strange things to the mind.

“I’m very sorry for your loss, ma’am.” I said, genuinely. “This knocking, did you try to investigate it?”

“I… I was too scared at first. I just lay in bed, pulling the covers up. But it wouldn’t stop. It just kept going. So, eventually, I got up. I turned on the light. I went to the wardrobe.”

Her breathing was getting faster. I could hear the faint rustle of fabric, like she was wringing her hands or clutching her clothes.

“And what happened when you got to the wardrobe, ma’am?”

“The knocking stopped when I got close. And then… then I heard a voice.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “A little boy’s voice. It said, ‘Help me. Please, help me. I’m trapped.’”

A chill, faint but definite, traced its way down my spine. This was… different. “A boy’s voice? From inside the wardrobe?”

“Yes! He sounded so scared. He said… he said his daddy put him in there and he can’t get out.”

Okay. This was escalating. A child’s voice claiming to be trapped by his father. This had moved past ‘old house sounds.’ But still, the details were… odd. A child just appearing in a wardrobe?

“Ma’am, did you open the wardrobe door?”

“Yes! As soon as he said that, I threw it open. I was expecting… I don’t know what I was expecting. But there was nothing there.” Her voice cracked with a mixture of fear and confusion. “Just my clothes. Shoes on the floor. Nothing. And the voice… it was gone. Silence.”

“Is the wardrobe in your master bedroom?”

“Yes, the big one. Oh God, he’s talking again.” Her voice was hushed, urgent. “He’s saying… he’s saying his dad locked him in because he was a ‘bad boy.’ He said his dad gets really mad and… and hurts him sometimes.”

That was it. That specific detail – the abuse allegation. Whether this was a delusion, a ghost, or something else entirely, if there was even a fraction of a chance a child was in danger, we had to act. My fingers flew across the keyboard, initiating a dispatch for a welfare check, possibly a child endangerment situation. I coded it high priority.

“Ma’am, I’m sending officers to your location right now, okay? They’re going to check this out. I need you to stay on the phone with me.”

“They’re coming? Oh, thank God. Thank you.” Relief flooded her voice, but the undercurrent of terror remained. “He’s… he’s crying now. The little boy. He’s saying his dad told him if he made any noise, he’d be in for it. He says he’s scared of the dark.”

I relayed the additional information to the responding units. “Caller states she can hear a child’s voice from a wardrobe, claiming his father locked him in and abuses him. Child is reportedly scared and crying.”

The dispatcher on the radio acknowledged. “Units en route. ETA six minutes.”

Six minutes can feel like an eternity on a call like this. I tried to keep her talking, to keep her grounded. “Ma’am, what’s your name?”

“It’s… it’s Eleanor. Eleanor Vance.”

“Okay, Eleanor. The officers are on their way. Are you somewhere you feel safe right now?”

“I’m in the living room, like I said. I have the door locked. But the sound… it’s like it’s getting clearer, even from here. Or maybe I’m just listening harder.” She paused. “He’s saying… ‘Daddy says I shouldn’t talk to strangers. But you’re not a stranger if you’re helping, are you?’”

My blood ran cold. The innocence of that, juxtaposed with the implied threat… it was deeply disturbing. “Are you talking to him?""
I asked her

""No, it's just, i can hear him so clearly, i dont know how he is talking to me from upstairs, it just like he can hear me talking to you . Maybe i shouldn't have came down, maybe i should go back to the room"" 

""No, Eleanor stay where you are. You’re helping. And we’re helping too. Wait for the dispatch please”

I could hear her quiet, fearful breathing. I focused on the CAD screen, watching the little car icons representing the patrol units crawl across the map towards Hawthorn Lane. Each tick of the clock in the dispatch center sounded unnaturally loud.

“Eleanor,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “when the officers arrive, they’ll knock. Let them know it’s you, okay?”

“Yes, yes, I will.” She was quiet for a moment, then, “He’s saying thank you. The little boy. He says he hopes they come soon because it’s hard to breathe in here.”

Hard to breathe. My stomach clenched. That detail was chillingly specific. Ventilation in a closed wardrobe wouldn’t be great.

“They’re almost there, Eleanor. Just a couple more minutes.”

“Unit 214, show us on scene at 1427 Hawthorn.” The voice of Officer Miller crackled through my headset.

“Copy that, 214. Caller is Eleanor Vance, should be expecting you. She’s in the living room, reports hearing a child in a wardrobe in the master bedroom.”

“10-4, Central.”

I relayed this to Eleanor. “They’re there, Eleanor. They’re at your door.”

“Oh, thank heavens.” I heard a faint shuffling sound, as if she was getting up. Then, nothing for a few seconds. I expected to hear her talking to the officers, the sound of a door opening.

Instead, Officer Miller’s voice came back on the radio, sounding puzzled. “Central, we have a male subject at the door. Advises he’s the homeowner.”

My brow furrowed. “A male subject? Ask him if Eleanor Vance is present. Or if there’s any female resident.”

A brief pause. “Central, negative. Male states he lives here alone with his son. Says there’s no Eleanor Vance here, no female resident at all.”

A cold dread, far deeper than before, began to spread through me. I looked at the address on my screen. 1427 Hawthorn Lane. Confirmed. “Eleanor?” I said into the phone. “Eleanor, are you there? The officers are saying a man answered the door. They say there’s no woman there.”

Her voice came back, faint and laced with utter confusion. “What? No… that’s impossible. I’m here. This is my house. I’m… I’m looking out the living room window. I can see the patrol car.”

“Unit 214,” I said, my voice tight, “caller on the line insists she is inside the residence, states she can see your vehicle.” This was getting stranger by the second.

“Eleanor,” I pressed, “what does this man look like? The one at the door?”

“I… I can’t see him clearly from here. Just… just his shape.” Her voice was trembling violently now. “But this is my house! I’ve lived here for twenty years! My husband, Robert… we bought it together.”

“214, the caller’s name is Eleanor Vance. She says her late husband was Robert. Does the name vance mean anything to mr collins?”

I waited, listening to the silence on Eleanor’s end, then Miller’s response. “Central, Mr. Collins says he bought this house three years ago. From an estate sale. Previous owner was deceased. A Robert Vance.”

My heart hammered against my ribs. Estate sale. Previous owner deceased. Robert Vance. That meant… Eleanor Vance…

“Eleanor?” I said softly. “The officer said Mr. Collins bought the house three years ago, from the estate of a Robert Vance. Eleanor… your husband’s name was Robert, you said.”

There was a long, drawn-out silence on her end. Just the sound of her breathing, growing more ragged, more panicked. It sounded like she was hyperventilating.

“Eleanor, can you hear me?”

Then, a choked sound. “No… no, that can’t be right. Robert… he passed last year. Not… not three years ago. I… I was with him.” Her voice was dissolving into confusion and fear. “This is… this is my home.”

This was spiraling out of my control, out of any recognizable scenario. But the child… the child was still the priority.

“Unit 214,” I said, pushing down my own disorientation. “Regardless of the caller’s status, the initial report was a child trapped in a wardrobe, possibly abused. Mr. Collins states he has a son. You need to verify the welfare of that child.”

There was a pause. I could hear Miller talking to Collins, muffled. Then Miller came back on. “Central, subject is refusing. Says the boy is fine, doesn’t want him woken up. He’s getting a bit agitated.”

“Eleanor,” I whispered into my phone, “are you still there?”
A faint, broken sound, like a gasp. “I… I don’t understand what’s happening…”

“214, reiterate that due to the specifics of the call, we need to see the child. It’s a welfare check.” My training kicked in. We had cause.

More muffled conversation, then Miller’s voice, sharper now. “Central, subject is becoming uncooperative. Denying access. He’s raising his voice.” Then, a sudden change in his tone. “Hold on… Central, did you hear that?”

“Hear what, 214?”

“A sound. From upstairs. Faint… like a cry. Or a thump.”

My gut twisted. “Eleanor,” I said quickly, “the wardrobe you heard the knocking from, which room is it in?”

“The… the master bedroom,” she whispered. “Upstairs. At the end of the hall.”

“214, the original report specified the master bedroom wardrobe, upstairs. Did you hear the sound from that direction?”

“Affirmative, Central. Definitely from upstairs. Subject is now trying to block the doorway. Partner is moving to restrain.”

The line with Eleanor was still open. I could hear her ragged, panicked gasps. It was like listening to someone drowning.

Then, chaos erupted on the radio. Shouting. “Sir, step aside!” “Police! Don’t resist!” Sounds of a struggle. My own pulse was roaring in my ears. I gripped the phone tighter.

“Central, we’re making entry to check on the child!” Officer Miller’s voice, strained. “Subject is non-compliant.”

I heard footsteps pounding on the radio feed, officers moving quickly. “Upstairs! Check the bedrooms!”

Eleanor was making soft, whimpering sounds now. “They’re in my house… but they can’t see me… Robert… what’s happening to me, Robert?”

“214, status?” I demanded.

“Checking rooms… Master bedroom at the end of the hall… Door’s closed…” A pause, then, “It’s locked.”

“Eleanor, was your bedroom door locked when you left it?”

“Yes… yes, I locked it,” she stammered.

“214, caller states she locked that door.”

“Okay, Central. We’re announcing, then forcing if no response.” I heard them call out, “Police! Occupant, open the door!” Silence. Then a thud, another. The sound of a door splintering.

“We’re in!” Miller shouted. “Wardrobe… it’s closed… Oh God. Central, we found him. Child in the wardrobe. He’s alive! Conscious, but terrified. Small boy, matches the description.”

A wave of dizzying relief washed over me, so strong it almost buckled me. He was real. The boy was real. They got to him. Arthur Collins was now in deep, deep trouble.

But then the other part of it crashed back in. Eleanor.

“Eleanor?” I said, my voice hoarse. “They found him. The little boy, Leo. He’s safe. They have him.”

Her response was a broken whisper, almost inaudible. “Leo… his name is Leo… He was… he was real…”

“Yes, Eleanor, he was real. But… the officers… they still don’t see you. Mr. Collins says you’re not there. Eleanor… where are you in the house right now?”

A long, shaky sigh. “I’m… I was in the living room. By the window. But… when they came in… they walked right past me. Right through where I was standing.” Her voice was filled with a dawning, unutterable horror. “They didn’t… they didn’t see me. He didn’t see me.”

“Eleanor…” I didn’t know what to say. What could I possibly say?

“The wardrobe… the master bedroom… that’s where I heard him so clearly. I spent so much time in that room… after Robert…” Her voice trailed off. Then, a new note of terror, colder than before. “If… if Mr. Collins bought the house three years ago… from Robert’s estate… and Robert died… then… when did I die?”

The question hung in the air, chilling me to the bone. I had no answer. My dispatcher’s manual had no protocol for this.

“I… I don’t feel anything,” she whispered, her voice sounding distant now, frayed. “It’s… it’s like I’m fading. I can’t… I can’t see the room clearly anymore. It’s… cold.”

“Eleanor? Eleanor, stay with me! Can you tell me anything else? Can you describe what you see around you now?” My professional instincts were useless, grasping at straws.

Her voice was barely a breath. “Just… dark… and wind… so much wind…”

Then, a click. The line went dead.

“Eleanor?” I yelled into the receiver. “Eleanor!”

Static.

My hand was shaking as I hit the redial button for the incoming number. It rang. Once. Twice. Then it connected.

But there was no voice. Just a sound. A faint, hollow, whistling sound, like wind blowing through a cracked windowpane, or across the mouth of an empty bottle. It was a sound I’d heard before, sometimes on bad connections, but this was different. This felt… empty. Desolate.

I listened for a full minute, my heart pounding, a cold sweat on my brow. The sound didn’t change. Just that soft, sighing wind.

I hung up.

The officers were dealing with Collins, getting medics for Leo. The immediate crisis was over. The boy was safe. That’s what mattered. That’s what I told myself.

But Eleanor…

I ran the number through our system again. It was a landline, registered to 1427 Hawthorn Lane. It had been for over twenty years. Registered to Robert and Eleanor Vance. It was probably disconnected after the estate sale, but somehow… somehow she had called from it. Or through it.


The report I filed was… complex. I focused on the tangible: the call, the child endangerment, the successful rescue. I omitted the parts about Eleanor’s apparent non-existence, her dawning realization. Who would believe it? They’d send me for psych eval. Maybe I should go.

But I know what I heard. I know how real her fear was. And I know that, whatever she was, she saved that little boy’s life. She reached across… whatever barrier separates us from whatever she is… and she made us listen.

I still work the midnight shift. The calls still come in. But now, sometimes, when there’s a strange silence on the line, or a whisper I can’t quite make out, I feel a different kind of chill. I think of Eleanor Vance, and the hollow wind on the other end of the line.

1kpqgfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1kpqgfn/im_pissed_what_do_i_do/,I'm pissed. What do I do?,"I had a seizure at work, Friday before last. It wasn't the first, and it won't be the last, and I am endlessly lucky to have an employer who will put up with that even once, let alone roughly monthly for years. 

But this one? It was unusual, for me, in that I didn't drop to the floor like a bag of flour (atonic seizure), nor did I get convulsions, pee myself, or break anything (all of those have happened before with some regularity). It seems I remained fully functional, and I even taught for an hour. But then, I laid down and fell asleep somewhere, and people panicked because they couldn't find me. When they finally did, I had lost 3-4 hours of my day, and I could not for the life of me explain how I had gotten where I was. 

I saw a neurologist on Wednesday, and had a sleep deprivation EEG. It turned out to most likely have been a known, but rare, form of focal temporal lobe epilepsy, in which motor function and cognition remain largely intact, except for the ability to store memories long term.

It's not the first time something like this has happened to me. But compared to other types of seizures I have, this one's a rarity. It happens less than once a year. It's also something that can be addressed, probably, by simply adjusting my meds. 

Still, even after I've explained what happened, and what we are doing about it, so that it's unlikely to happen again any time soon, people at work are still panicking over it. They are forbidding me from doing oral exams (I'm a teacher). I understand, and yet I don't. I can take notes. I always do. When someone asks me afterwards what was said during the exam, I'll just ... check my notes, like everyone else in the history of oral exams has?

Or ... I could simply decide to do a written exam. No big deal. At least it wouldn't be, if I could have decided that on my own. But no. They had to come in and *tell* me to. 

And I am pissed. 

Months ago, they forbade me from being a monitor during written exams. It bugged me, but I let it go. Because who likes that, anyway? To walk around in circles for two to four hours, while checking that Johnny isn't copying his answers off the inside of his thigh? I don't. I got some paperwork to sort and file instead, and I happily did that, while chatting with colleagues and drinking coffee.   

This time, though. This time, they are interfering with something I consider a core part of my job. What's next? No teaching, unless you have a babysitter with you? 

Thanks, but no thanks. It feels as if I'm a wounded bird, and I have to sit and wait patiently while someone takes my wings off, one feather at a time. 

I've seriously considered quitting. Because as painful as that would be (and oh, it would be painful; I love my students, and I'm good at what I do), I think it would still hurt less than being stripped of this part of my identity, little by litte.
