1qiz4x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qiz4x1/aitah_for_refusing_to_let_my_cousin_bring_her/,AITAH for refusing to let my cousin bring her kids every time she visits my house?,"I (30F) live alone in a small apartment and I don’t have kids. I like my place calm and pretty minimal — nothing fancy, but clean, quiet, and honestly my safe space after long workdays. I don’t hate kids, I just built my life in a way that doesn’t revolve around them.

My cousin (33F) has two kids, ages 6 and 4. Every time she comes over, she brings them without asking. At first, I didn’t say anything because I know childcare is hard and I didn’t want to seem rude. But her kids are… a lot. They run around, touch everything, jump on my couch, and once even knocked over a lamp. She usually laughs it off and says “they’re just being kids.”

The breaking point came last month when she came over for coffee and the kids drew on my wall with crayons while she was on her phone. I was shocked. She apologized, but didn’t offer to clean it or pay for repainting. That same visit, one of them spilled juice on my rug. I was stressed the entire time, and instead of relaxing, I spent the day hovering and cleaning.

The next time she asked to come over, I told her she was welcome, but I’d prefer if she didn’t bring the kids every single time — or at least ask first. I explained that my apartment isn’t childproof and that hosting them is overwhelming for me. She immediately got defensive and said I was “anti-kid” and acting like her children were a burden. She said if the kids aren’t welcome, then she isn’t either.

Now some family members are involved, saying I should be more understanding because she’s a mom and doesn’t always have childcare. Others say it’s my home and I’m allowed to set boundaries. I feel bad because I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also don’t think it’s fair that my space keeps getting disrespected.

So… AITA for refusing to let my cousin bring her kids every time she visits my house?",1,1769005262.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1qiz1kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1qiz1kh/the_bully_who_got_my_dad_fired_had_to_beg_him_for/,"The bully who got my dad fired had to beg him for a sale years later. My dad made him wait 2.5 hours, gave him false hope, and then crushed it.","This story is about my dad, his first job, and a dish served very cold years later.

Years ago, my dad got his first job in sales at a wholesale computer shop. He got the role through a connection, and he was the only sales guy on the team. The rest of the staff included two technicians. My dad actually knew one of the technicians already they were former batchmates from an IT course.

You would think having a familiar face would make things easier, but it was the opposite. As time went on, it became clear that the two technicians hated him. They treated him like absolute garbage. It wasn't just workplace banter; it was actual mental torture. It seemed like their only purpose in coming to work was to make my dad miserable.

It got so bad that my dad would go home and cry every single day. His mental health took a massive hit, and naturally, he couldn't perform well in sales because he was a wreck. He even went to the owner’s house once and broke down crying, begging for help regarding these two. The owner didn’t care. Eventually, my dad was fired for ""poor performance.""

That experience was so traumatic that my dad quit sales entirely. He pivoted into teaching, which he ended up loving. Fast forward many years, and he worked his way up to become the Principal of an international school.

One day, the school was in the market to purchase a large number of PCs. A salesperson showed up at the school to discuss quotes. My dad got a call from his assistant saying there was a vendor waiting to see him.

My dad asked for the name. He immediately realized who it was. It was the ""batchmate"" technician the same guy who had tormented him years ago.

My dad told his assistant to make him wait.

He let the guy sit there for two and a half hours. My dad went about his day, drank his coffee, and did paperwork while this guy sat in the waiting room, probably sweating bullets.

Finally, he told the assistant to send him in. The technician walked in, but he clearly didn’t realize the power dynamic had shifted. He started with all the formalities, asking how my dad was, trying to be charmed. Then, he had the nerve to pull the ""old friends"" card.

He said, ""Do you remember we used to be batchmates in that IT course? Those were such lovely times!""

Here is the kicker: Not once during the meeting did the technician mention the time they worked together at the wholesale shop. He conveniently ""forgot"" the months he spent tormenting my dad because he knew if he brought it up, the sale was dead.

Instead, he ended up oversharing because he was desperate. He told my dad he had been fired from that original shop, fired from multiple jobs after that, and eventually took out a large loan to start his own shop. He admitted his shop wasn't doing well and he *really* needed this sale to make his loan payments, otherwise, he might have to close down.

The same man who used to make my dad cry was now calling him ""Sir,"" being super respectful, and practically begging for my dad's help.

My dad decided to twist the knife. He didn't kick him out immediately. He listened to the pitch for a full 20 minutes, asking questions, nodding, and giving the guy false hope that he was actually going to get this life-saving contract.

After wasting nearly 3 hours of this guy's day and getting his hopes up, my dad simply told him, ""I'll let you know.""

He did not buy the PCs.

We later found out that the owner of that original store the one who fired my dad went bankrupt and is now working a menial job as a technician at a repair shop. As for the bully? I doubt his shop stayed open much longer without that sale.

**TL;DR:** My dad was bullied by a technician at his first job until he was fired. Years later, my dad is a school Principal and the bully (now a failing business owner) showed up to pitch a sale he desperately needed. Dad made him wait 2.5 hours, let him do his whole pitch to get his hopes up, and then denied him the sale.

1qiyyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1qiyyfe/nomad_is_the_perfect_tech_neighborhood_but_so/,NoMad is the perfect tech neighborhood but so sketchy for what you're paying,"Moved here last year and I have mixed feelings.

On one hand the density of people in my network and cool things to check out is unmatched. I work in recruiting and literally everyone is here. Greenhouse, Lattice, Twill, Deel, bunch of smaller ones. I can walk to coffee chats, interviews, happy hours, whatever. My whole network is within like 10 blocks. For tech people its honestly perfect.

On the other hand... why is it so sketchy?? Im paying $3400 for a 1br and theres always something going on outside my building at 8am. The penn station spillover is real. My husband got followed home twice. Ive seen multiple fights outside the walgreens on 32nd.

Like im not expecting the upper east side for this price but the contrast between ""oh cute theres a startup office and a juice press"" and ""oh theres a guy screaming at a mailbox"" is insane. Sometimes on the same block.

The weekends are also dead. Its just tourists going to koreatown and empty office buildings. No neighborhood feel at all. I miss brooklyn for that.

But I stay because the convenience for work is too good. Everything I need is walking distance. I just wish it felt safer for what we're paying. Cant tell if this is universal or if I just picked a bad block

I also make faux cold brew with the Oxo rapid brewer when traveling which takes a very fine almost powdery grind size (1-2 out of 12 on Costco grinder).

1qiyu5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qiyu5k/am_i_overreacting_about_my_parents_apartment/,Am I overreacting about my parents’ apartment choice? (Building A vs Building B),"Hi Reddit I need a reality check.

My parents are moving and we’ve been apartment hunting. I previously lived in Building B and genuinely loved it great vibe, felt safe, easy groceries/coffee/errands, and overall a really positive living experience.

Before all this, I worked with a professional apartment locator and sent my parents 15+ apartment options in what I thought were decent areas. Then I had surgery, so I wasn’t super involved for a couple of weeks, and my sister stepped in to help them tour places.

Now she’s really pushing Building A because:

	•	It’s newer

	•	It’s bigger

	•	It’s under $2k

	•	They’re offering a 10-week concession

But here’s the thing I looked it up and Building A is only about one year newer than Building B. So it’s not like we’re comparing an old building to a brand-new one. They’re basically in the same “new construction” generation.

On paper Building A looks amazing. But I’m uncomfortable with:

	•	Safety / night vibes

	•	Parking and car break-ins I’ve heard about

	•	It not being very walkable

	•	It feeling more “young professional / transient” than “quiet parents”

Meanwhile, Building B is:

	•	Smaller

	•	More expensive

	•	Slightly older (by about a year)

	•	But somewhere I personally lived and felt genuinely safe and happy in.

My parents keep saying:

“We don’t want to pay too much AND we want a big apartment.”

And I keep thinking:

You can’t have big + nice + cheap + safe unless you pay a lot more.

They’re also really tempted by the 10-week free rent at Building A, and I don’t even know:

	•	If it’s prorated

	•	Or if it just masks the real rent long-term

So here’s my question:

Am I overreacting for pushing back on Building A and preferring Building B (or similar safer-feeling buildings), even though it’s smaller and more expensive?

Or am I being realistic about rent math and neighborhood tradeoffs?

I feel like I’m being painted as “negative” when I’m just trying to stop my parents from ending up somewhere that looks great on tour but stresses them out long-term.

1qiytxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qiytxd/the_psychology_of_staying_lean_15_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Staying Lean: 15 Science-Based Habits (No Calorie Counting),"I spent way too long researching why some people stay lean without even trying. Like genuinely obsessed with understanding this. Read through nutrition journals, watched hours of behavior science lectures, stalked those Reddit threads where people casually mention they ""forget to eat sometimes"" (wild concept to me). The rabbit hole was deep.



Turns out most advice is trash. Everyone screams about macros and meal prep and hitting the gym at 5am. But here's what nobody talks about: the people who stay slim naturally aren't doing anything that extreme. They've just built certain default behaviors that keep them lean without conscious effort. It's less about willpower and more about environment design and psychology.



So here's what actually works based on solid research and observation.



Stop eating when you're 80% full. This comes from the Okinawan concept of ""hara hachi bu"" and it's genuinely life changing. The Japanese have studied this forever. Your brain takes about 20 minutes to register fullness, so if you eat until you feel stuffed, you've already overshot by a lot. Naturally thin people tend to have better hunger cue awareness. They stop when satisfied, not when the plate's empty or their stomach hurts. Practice putting your fork down between bites and actually checking in with your body. Sounds simple but most of us were raised in the ""clean your plate"" era so we completely ignore these signals.



Use smaller plates and bowls. Brian Wansink's research at Cornell (yeah I know some of his work got scrutinized but this principle holds up) showed that plate size massively influences consumption. A study in the Journal of Consumer Research found people serve themselves 30% more food when using larger dishes. It's pure visual trickery but it works. Your brain judges portion sizes relative to the container. Same amount of food looks more satisfying on a smaller plate. Naturally slim people often just have smaller dishware and don't think twice about it.



Eat slowly and actually taste your food. Put your phone away. Stop watching Netflix while shoveling food in. Research published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that eating quickly is strongly associated with higher BMI. When you eat fast, you bypass satiety signals and consume way more before your brain catches up. Slim people tend to be more present during meals. They chew thoroughly, they notice flavors, they take breaks. This isn't some mindfulness guru BS, it's basic biology. Your gut needs time to communicate with your brain via hormones like leptin and GLP1.



Keep tempting foods out of sight. Google researcher James Anderson found that people sitting near candy dishes ate 48% more than those sitting two meters away. Environment shapes behavior more than willpower ever will. If there's a cookie jar on your counter, you'll eat more cookies. Period. Naturally thin people structure their spaces differently. They don't rely on discipline, they just don't surround themselves with constant food cues. Out of sight genuinely becomes out of mind. Stock your fridge with whole foods at eye level, bury the junk in the back or don't buy it at all.



Drink water first thing in the morning and before meals. A study in Obesity journal found that drinking 500ml of water before meals led to 44% more weight loss over 12 weeks compared to non water drinkers. It's not magic, it just fills your stomach and reduces meal intake slightly. Also most people walk around mildly dehydrated which can mimic hunger signals. Your hypothalamus controls both thirst and hunger and sometimes wires get crossed. Slim people often have water bottles permanently attached to them. They drink water out of boredom instead of snacking.



Sleep 7 to 9 hours consistently. This one's huge. Sleep deprivation wrecks your hunger hormones. When you're tired, ghrelin (hunger hormone) spikes and leptin (satiety hormone) drops. Research from the University of Chicago found that people who slept 5.5 hours consumed 300 more calories the next day than those who slept 8.5 hours. You're also way more likely to crave high carb high sugar foods when exhausted because your brain needs quick energy. Naturally thin people prioritize sleep. Not as a weight loss strategy but because they feel like garbage without it, which indirectly keeps their eating regulated.



Stop eating 2 to 3 hours before bed. Late night eating disrupts your circadian rhythm and messes with metabolic processes. A study in Cell Metabolism showed that eating late increases fat storage compared to eating the same foods earlier in the day. Your body's insulin sensitivity is lower at night. Also, you're usually not eating a nutritious dinner at 11pm, you're raiding the pantry for chips and ice cream. Slim people tend to have earlier dinners and they're done. They don't graze all evening. Their kitchens close after a certain time.



Eat protein and fiber at every meal. Both increase satiety significantly. Protein has the highest thermic effect of all macros, meaning your body burns more calories digesting it. Fiber slows digestion and keeps you full longer. Research in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that increasing protein intake to 30% of calories reduced cravings by 60% and late night snacking by 50%. You don't need to count anything, just make sure every meal has a decent protein source (eggs, fish, chicken, legumes, tofu) and fiber (vegetables, fruits, whole grains). Naturally skinny people gravitate toward these foods because they're actually satisfying.



Walk after meals, even just 10 minutes. This isn't exercise in the traditional sense, it's just movement. A study in Diabetes Care found that a 15 minute walk after eating significantly improved blood sugar control. Walking aids digestion and prevents that sluggish food coma feeling that makes you want to collapse on the couch and snack more later. In many cultures, post meal walks are just standard practice. Blue Zone populations do this automatically. It's woven into their lifestyle, not treated as a workout.



Eat sitting down at a table. No eating standing at the fridge. No eating in your car. No eating hunched over your laptop. Cornell research found that people eat significantly more when eating in front of screens or while distracted. When you sit at a table, you're creating a ritual that signals to your brain ""this is a meal."" You're more likely to eat appropriate portions and actually register that you've eaten. Slim people treat meals as events, not inconveniences to multitask through.



Keep healthy snacks visible and prepped. If the only thing ready to eat is baby carrots and hummus, you'll eat that. If you have to wash and chop vegetables while there's a bag of chips screaming at you, guess which wins. Behavioral economics shows that people choose the path of least resistance. Make the healthy option the easy option. Naturally thin people aren't more disciplined, they're just better at setting up their environment. Wash your fruit when you get home from the store. Pre cut vegetables. Have hard boiled eggs ready. Remove friction from good choices.



Use the ""one handful"" rule for snacks. Portion control without measuring. Research shows people significantly underestimate serving sizes when eating straight from packages. The average person eats 50% more chips from a family size bag than from a small single serve bag. If you want crackers or nuts, pour one handful into a bowl and put the package away. Don't bring the whole container to the couch. This is something slim people do instinctively. They don't deny themselves snacks, they just naturally portion them out.



Avoid liquid calories. Juice, soda, fancy coffee drinks, alcohol, they add up insanely fast and don't trigger satiety the same way solid food does. A study in the International Journal of Obesity found that liquid calories don't compensate by reducing solid food intake later. Your body doesn't register drinking 300 calories the same as eating 300 calories. Stick to water, black coffee, unsweetened tea. If you drink alcohol, factor that in. Naturally thin people typically drink their calories sparingly or not at all.



Don't keep ""trigger foods"" in the house. Everyone has that one food they can't control around. For me it's peanut butter. For you it might be ice cream or chips or chocolate. Here's the thing, willpower is finite. Don't test it daily. If it's not in your house, you can't eat it in a moment of weakness. And no, you won't drive to the store at 10pm for it. You will however demolish an entire pint if it's in your freezer. Slim people are honest about what foods they can't moderate and they just don't buy them regularly.



Establish consistent meal times. Your body thrives on routine. When you eat at random times, your hunger hormones get dysregulated. Research in Proceedings of the Nutrition Society showed that irregular eating patterns are associated with higher body fat and worse metabolic health. Eating at consistent times trains your body to expect food then and reduces random cravings throughout the day. Naturally thin people often eat lunch around the same time daily, dinner around the same time. It's boring but effective.



If you want a more structured approach to building these habits, there's an app called BeFreed that creates personalized learning plans around health and behavior change goals. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from nutrition research, behavioral psychology studies, and expert insights to generate custom audio lessons. You can set a goal like ""build sustainable eating habits without dieting"" and it'll create a plan specifically for that, with adjustable depth depending on whether you want quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly good, there's one that sounds like the AI from Her which makes learning about leptin regulation way less boring than it should be.



Look, none of this is groundbreaking. It's not sexy. But the unsexy truth is that naturally skinny people aren't doing anything radical. They've just normalized these small behaviors until they became automatic. You're not fighting biology here, you're working with it.

I met her, she was coldhearted, reserved and did not seem interested in me in the slightest but I fell in love with her, some thing about her, she was different in ways I can’t describe. I was deploying and for 3 months straight I was there, I tried and tried and tried to get any form of emotion out of her but she never gave in. She told me she had been raped when she was younger. She kept telling me she liked me but she would only consider a relationship with me after I returned from deployment. A few days before I deployed she messaged me and told me she didn’t want a relationship and that she felt like I was rushing her and she had some things she had to work through before she could commit to a relationship…that ultimately broke my heart as I really wanted her and we didn’t speak for a while

She messaged me a few weeks later and told me she was sorry she was just scared and that she did like me but she’s scared of getting hurt again. While I was deployed we were talking, calling and then I came back from deployment due to a personal matter for a week and I went to her. She changed, she slept with me, she let me close and it was like she was completely different. I was conflicted. I didn’t know if it was true. One night she saw another girl message me and asked me who it was and I panicked and told her it was just a friend who I had met for coffee but she looked suspicious. 

I went back to deployment and we were fighting, she was very argumentative with me, in a funny mood eventually the relationship ended and 2 days later she was in bed with another guy. She saw me commenting on my friends posts and did not like it when we were together but it wasn’t meant in that way. Her friend messaged me and told me off for how I treated her and made me feel like the bad person. I would message her and she acted upset and all of a sudden like she cared but I didn’t believe it. 

Her friend was telling me she was shagging another guy, that her and her best mate were together but when I would confront her she would deny it and get annoyed. Her friend then created a fake Snapchat account that she did not know about and pretended to be her and got to me to admit to talking to other girls and told her stories. I confronted her and she said she did know her friend would have done that and she repeatedly would tell me to just block her friend as her friend loves to cause drama. 

Her guy best friend then got involved and told me to stop messaging her and involving her in drama with her friend. We would constantly just fight, fight and fight but through all of this girl had my heart. She would tell me she would come see me, I would ask her if we would sleep together and then she would say yes and they say no. She would send images to me and tell me she would sleep with me again but then turn around and make out I was treating her like a slag and that she wasn’t gonna come see me if I just wanted sex 

Eventually we had time apart and I messaged her and she responded and then not soon long after her guy best mate messaged me again and told me to leave her alone, her guy best friend looks like a gremlin and just wants her for a shag, she would tell me to just block him and that she doesn’t want drama. She told me they never slept together, he told me they did, he send me a screenshot of her admitting it but then all of a sudden it wasn’t true and he said that she told him to say that because I wouldn’t believe her and she told me nothing happened between them 

Eventually her friend DM’d the girl she was suspicious about and send her screenshots of what had actually happened between us. Nothing sexual but she had told me she didn’t want a relationship so I met another girl because I thought she didn’t want me. She told me either to communicate with her about my feelings or lose her and I was conflicted and later on she went back to her guy best friend after she had got rid of him as he would keep messaging me and I would message him and she asked all of us to stop. She eventually went back to him and told me that he had accountability something I lacked. I blocked her as she told me I didn’t have a right to decide I still have feelings for her after I ended things. She then send me the screenshots over TikTok and told me to go slit my writs because I lied to her. I don’t know if she was being honest with me about her guy best friend. I messaged her mum a screenshot of what she said…stupid I know and this pissed her off MASSIVELY but I was hurt and wasn’t thinking straight. 

Chris her guy best friend would then message me again and started talking about her sexually again, I showed this to her and at first she didn’t open the message and then I messaged her again and then she responded. 

Later on I was added into a Snapchat account with her and him and he was making out that she choose him, she told him over the Snapchat account she would sleep with me again before she ever sleeps with him again, I was drunk and said stupid shit, she and I got into an argument over the Snapchat and eventually her guy best friend left the chat. 

The next morning she told me she was still pissed off with me for lying to her and she said it does amuse her that I blocked her and then still send her screenshots of what people are saying. 

Eventually she snapped and told me that I was not to use her name to boost my ego in front of my mates, told me I was a joke, being with me was embarrassing and that she has no tolerance, desire to ever speak or see me again. She told me that if I continue talking about her with Chris in a sexual manner she will message my mum everything and embarrass me. I left the group 

She phoned me later and asked me for my mums name, was shouting, said she will do to me what I did to her, told me I lied and that talking about her in a sexual manner was not appropriate. She was Angry. She told me that Chris had told her stuff. She kept asking what’s my mums name and eventually I just ended the call 

She then DM’d me and told me she had my mums number and told me her name and that I better listen to her as it was the last time she was warning me and said if she finds out again that I was talking about her sexually she will message my mum everything and threatened me. She told me she will message my mum what an embarrassment and good for nothing her son is. She blocked me again afterwards 

I was told she also cut off her guy best friend.

Extend deadlines for absentee ballots after Election Day.

Allow voting electronically over the internet.

Expand ranked-choice voting.

Extend ballot-curing deadlines.

Redact candidate addresses from FOIA requests.

Join the national popular vote compact.

Make hand-counting ballots illegal.

⁣⁣⁣

𝗚𝗨𝗡 𝗖𝗢𝗡𝗧𝗥𝗢𝗟 — 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗢𝗙 𝗜𝗧

$500 sales tax on suppressors.

Magazine bans and “assault weapon” restrictions.

11% sales tax on all firearms and ammunition.

Prohibit outdoor shooting on properties under five acres.

⁣⁣⁣

Lower penalties for robbery.

⁣⁣⁣

This is the lie finally exposed. For months, voters were told the radicals were fringe — that the party’s future was moderates like Spanberger. She lasted about a cup of coffee before rolling out a hard-left agenda that barely resembles Virginia.

⁣⁣⁣

Even in a purple state, this is how Democrats govern — regardless of what they promise on the campaign trail.

The era of the “moderate Democrat” isn’t fading.

When I finally got to my boyfriend’s house I slipped into bed with him, we spoke briefly about my crazy drive and eventually I fell asleep with him wrapped around me. Finally safe and able to slow down.

I slept until at least 3 pm. I woke up to extra blankets put on me, he was worried I’d get cold as the power and heat had not come back until 1 pm. The storm had calmed down by now, there was still snow but not near as much and sadly I had to go back to work soon. He made me a cup of coffee and I drank it while I wore one of his sweaters. Without even thinking he told me he would dig my car out of the snow while I hopped in the shower and got ready for work.

I’m a very independent person and would never \*ask\* for all of these things, but it’s nice to think that I deserve them. Theres something about the night shift and the exhaustion that makes me feel vulnerable in a way. There’s also something about that morning that is so intimate to me. Earlier that day he was insisting I could get in bed with him and that waking him wouldn’t bother him at all, or that he’d even sleep on the couch if I wanted his bed to myself. Not to mention refusing the option that I slept on the couch entirely. Putting more blankets on me while I slept. Somebody might read this and think it’s bare minimum, but there’s something about it that’s very special to me.

...The reason for that is that I cycle 25-50k every day, and right now it is like 0 degrees outside so it's a brute of a tour. I very seriously need my breaks to chug back an ""aggressive"" feeling drink, like, it has to be carbonated so strong that it almost foams, it needs to be super sweet and it needs to be instant. I tried coffee in thermos bottles, I even tried mate tea but it just. does. not. cut it. it absolutely does not ""work"" for me at all.

1qiylby,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DM6NCVFC,"FREE KINDLE BOOK – 2 DAYS ONLY (January 21-22, 2026) Poetry: Reflections On Existence: A Journey Through Words.","# Review: Reflections On Existence: A Journey Through Words by David Mark Kirkwood

Step aside, Rumi. Move over, Bukowski. There’s a new curator of chaos on the existential stage, and his name is David Mark Kirkwood. *Reflections On Existence: A Journey Through Words* is a kaleidoscope of warehouse pragmatics, cosmic ponderings, societal critique, and spiritual whimsy—a collection that hops from the fluorescent-lit aisles of late-stage capitalism straight into the black-hole logic of time and space.

Kirkwood doesn’t just write poems; he interrogates existence itself, often with the unflinching gaze of a forklift operator watching a rogue pallet hurtle toward catastrophe. In *Unchecked Momentum*, he warns: “Death roller, rolling Death, Powered pallet-mover Out of control… Nothing to stop the momentum But time and space.” If Kafka had worked in a warehouse, this might have been his line, right before he got promoted to manager for being “so bad at his job he needed a bigger office.”

The collection oscillates between grounded humor and mind-bending metaphysics. In *Within the Black Hole*, Kirkwood observes a UFO with his sisters in the 1970s and calculates it moving “about 180,000 kilometres per hour.” He theorizes a black-hole-dominated universe where A.I. study drones collect data on non-existence—a mix of Hawking, Asimov, and a touch of David Lynch, all set to the ambient soundtrack of pallet clanging and scanner beeps.

Yet the work is never content to dwell solely in cosmic abstraction. Kirkwood’s social commentary slices sharply through the ordinary: *“Pissing money out the window In an attempt To save money… Hemorrhaging dollars To save pennies.”* Here, he channels a mix of George Carlin’s economic rage and Noam Chomsky’s structural critique, all framed in the poetic cadence of someone who’s truly spent decades watching systems creak, grind, and fail.

Love, life, death, and absurdity intertwine seamlessly. In *Joyous Suffering*, he writes: “I’m alive—So alive! Blessed By joyous suffering.” And later, in *Feasting on Decay*, he likens collapsing institutions to scavengers picking clean the carcass of control—“Even as The shark, the eel, The minnows feed.” There’s a clear reverence for the poetic tradition of the observer, from Whitman’s exaltation of experience to Eliot’s modernist sense of despair, but Kirkwood does it with a distinctly wry, modern sensibility that includes forklifts, coffee breaks, and the occasional pulse gun.

Humor, irreverence, and self-awareness pervade the work. *Safety First, Irony Second* lampoons bureaucratic rigidity: “During this process, The operator is completely Unprepared for an incident… Oh, safety.” And yet, amidst the absurdity, moments of profound clarity emerge: *“Live While you can. Live For you are. Live!”* It’s an existential manual, a cosmic diary, a satirical critique, and a heartfelt meditation all rolled into one.

By the time we reach *The Great Baby Strike: A Call to Arms*, Kirkwood transitions from the microcosm of workplace absurdity to the macrocosm of societal revolution, blending political foresight with poetic lyricism: “We must fight. After this upcoming struggle. We must fight. So we can continue to fight. Fight for life, Fight for love, FIGHT!” One feels the weight of both immediacy and prophecy, as if Orwell had spent a decade in the warehouse and then took up the pen.

In sum, *Reflections On Existence* is equal parts Joyce, Vonnegut, and Sisyphus on a coffee break, with riffs on philosophy, physics, bureaucracy, and cosmic dread. It’s messy, it’s glorious, it’s uncomfortable, and it’s undeniably alive—much like Kirkwood himself, eternally navigating pallets, paradoxes, and the pulse of existence.

>

Kirkwood reminds us that poetry need not be polite to be profound, that laughter and dread can coexist, and that existence—fleeting, absurd, and fragile—is to be celebrated in all its chaotic glory.",1,1769003938.0,freebooks,0,1.0,False

Like where 16th century Mohican people are on Nextdoor.*

When the glaciers finally melted away at the end of the last Ice Age, the broad river valley around what would one day become Albany, New York became habitable. Thick, pine-perfumed forests full of deer and elk broke the horizon in every direction. You could almost walk across the deep, cold river on the squiggling backs of all the bass and sturgeon. As the first inhabitants gazed at this nameless landscape from atop the high river bluffs, they sighed and thought “This place is certainly *okay*. But somehow it just doesn’t feel as cool as every other place.”

Centuries came, centuries went. Cultures migrated in, saved up a bit of money and then moved out to Colorado with their friends. Around 1000 A.D., a group of Algonkian-speaking people called Mahikans arrived. After several years of barbacking, making pro-and-con lists about various life plans, and failing to get a monthly Dungeons & Dragons game started, the Mahikan people turned to agriculture: Primarily corn, squash and beans.

https://i.redd.it/0r4nbtdjkpeg1.gif

Mahikans settled a community along the river, near present-day Albany, and they called it *Pempotowwuthut Muhhcanneuw* which translates as “one day Jimmy Fallon will drop out of college here and knowing that fact will give you some small amount of local clout.” 

Mahikan culture was complex. One important part of it, shared by all the inhabitants of *Pempotowwuthut Muhhcanneuw*, was the conviction that downtown was and always had been dead after 5 o’clock, and that someone should really do something about it. This is notable, because at the time they didn’t have a downtown. Or clocks. The conviction was very deeply felt all the same.

Sometime after 1300 A.D. Iroquoian-speaking tribes began migrating into the area. At first the Mahikans were hopeful, thinking that maybe the newcomers would bring that *je nais se quois* their homeland lacked, that itty-bitty *joie de vivre* that comes from knowing that your place is its own kind of place: Maybe a gluten-free microbrewery or a coffee shop that had board games you could play too, or just a legitimately cute bakery? Something. Anything. 

But no. The new tribes - the Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida and Erie - began fighting with the Mahikans, and amongst themselves. The disputes were primarily over hunting grounds, trading relationships and a few eyebrow-poppingly overt racist comments on Nextdoor. 

Eventually this got old and three leaders - Deganawidah, Hiawatha and Jigonsaseh - started to riff. Eventually they came up with a new system that would settle disputes and bring people closer together. They called it the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Trade blossomed. Hangouts bloomed. The vibes were both organic and immaculate. 

Historians still study the Haudenosaunee Confederacy today: For its innovative political organization, for the inspiration it provided to the later U.S. Constitution, but mostly because it was the first and last time in recorded history that anyone over the age of 30 in the Albany area made a friend. 

https://i.redd.it/enzbfrmlkpeg1.gif

The way most Native Americans understood the Universe, time was cyclical. The leaves on the oak trees grew green, then yellow, then red. Until they fell. And then started growing green again. Kind of like hope. The great dances were all danced in their times. Great snows buried villages and melted into toe-chilling mudpuddles. Stories that had almost been nearly forgotten were told again, and then nearly forgotten again. The great river they called *Muhheakantuck* kept flowing south, and then occasionally north, owing to some tidal estuary action around Poughkeepsie, which was kind of unique, but a fifth-tier tourist attraction at best. Life went on. It’s easy to forget how fast time passes.

Then one morning there was a large, extra-pointy canoe in *Muhheankantuck* and it carried several dozen very pale, very overwhelmed looking and hairy men. The boat tacked around awkwardly in the river, as if it was looking for its keys. The Mahikans grew excited. Visitors are always very validating. Plus, maybe these guys had some ideas. Maybe together they could bring in a minor-league lacrosse team that would stick around for more than two seasons. That would be great. Maybe this place was about to become a real place.

Maybe they were all on the cusp of something big. Something good.  

Or maybe not.

That's stupid. A newsletter is probably the highest-ROI marketing channel you're ignoring.

**Why you need this**

Your newsletter is:

* A direct line to customers (no algorithm bullshit)
* A trust machine that turns cold leads into buyers
* An asset you actually own
* A testing ground for offers before you build them

I've seen founders blow $10K/month on ads while ignoring 2,000 people on their email list. Email converts at 3-5x higher rates than social + You control the entire experience.

**Setup (one weekend max)**

* Pick a platform (Substack/beehiiv/ConvertKit - doesn't matter)
* Landing page with value prop + email box
* Professional sending domain
* 2 welcome emails
* Done

Don't spend 3 months ""preparing."" Ship it this weekend.

*Quick tip: Warm up your domain for 1-2 weeks by emailing yourself, then friends. Keeps you out of spam.*

**Getting subscribers**

The truth is Your product might be great, but obody cares until they trust you. Your newsletter builds trust at scale.

Pick ONE platform where your customers hang out (LinkedIn/X for B2B). Create content that solves ONE problem. Add a simple CTA.

What works:

* Frameworks they can reuse
* Case studies with real numbers
* Contrarian takes (with receipts)
* Tactical how-to guides

Every post = newsletter lead magnet. Every newsletter = nurturing toward a sale.

**Writing emails that convert**

Your newsletter isn't a blog. It's a sales vehicle wrapped in value. The formula:

* **Subject line:** Create curiosity. ""Newsletter #12"" = ignored. ""How I closed $47K with 3 emails"" = opened.
* **One idea per email:** Solve one problem deeply
* **Conversational tone:** Friend at coffee, not boardroom presentation
* **Clear CTA:** Move them closer to buying

**The AI piece**

Not using AI in 2025 = leaving money on the table. I voice-record ideas between meetings. AI drafts it in my voice. I edit for 10-15 mins and send.

4 hours - 45 minutes.

Built a tool for this with a friend because the manual version got annoying. Might launch it, the time savings are insane (lmk if interested).

**Making actual money**

Treat your newsletter like a revenue channel, not a side project.

**When to monetize:** Way earlier than you think. People make $5K at 300 subscribers if those people trust them.

Signal you're ready: Replies, questions, engagement.

**What to sell:**

* Low-ticket ($50-500): Templates, guides, small coaching
* Mid-ticket ($500-5K): Courses, consulting packages
* High-ticket ($5K+): Done-for-you, retainers, masterminds

**The key:** Your newsletter IS market research. Watch for:

* Questions in replies
* Repeated problems
* High-engagement topics

Build offers around what they're already asking for.

**Consistency without burnout**

The death spiral: Launch → 3 issues → skip → guilt → quit.

Fix: Systems, not motivation. Pick what's sustainable (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly). Batch 4 newsletters at once. Use AI. Build templates. Don't wait for inspiration.

**Real numbers**

What's realistic:

* 500 subs = $2-5K/month
* 2,000 subs = $10-20K/month
* 5,000 subs = $25-50K+/month

Depends on niche and offer, but very achievable if you treat it like business.

1,000 subscribers = top 10% 5,000 = top 3% 10,000+ = 6-7 figure asset

**Bottom line**

You're already creating content. You already have expertise. You probably have an audience.

Newsletter = turn that into predictable revenue.

Takes 6-12 months of consistent work. No shortcuts. But better ROI than almost any marketing you're doing.",1,1769003615.0,HowToEntrepreneur,0,1.0,False

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **Most people are sitting on way more financial power than they realize—they’re just not using it the right way.**

Think about it:
- That $5 daily coffee? **$1,825 a year.** (Yes, we did the math.)
- The subscription you forgot to cancel? **$200+ down the drain.**
- The ""just in case"" savings sitting in a low-interest account? **Losing value every single day.**

Money isn’t just about *how much* you have—it’s about **how hard it’s working for you.** And if you’re not putting yours to work, you’re basically leaving free money on the table.

### **3 Signs You’re Undervaluing Your Money**
1. **You treat savings like a storage unit.** Parking cash in a basic savings account is like storing a Ferrari in a garage and never driving it. **Inflation eats it alive.**
2. **You confuse ""saving"" with ""investing.""** Saving = stashing. Investing = growing. One keeps you stuck; the other builds wealth.
3. **You wait for ""someday.""** ""I’ll invest when I have more."" Newsflash: **Time is your biggest asset.** The sooner you start, the less you need to put in later.

### **The Simple Shift That Changes Everything**
Here’s the game-changer: **Small, smart moves compound into massive results.** Example?
- Move $500/month from a 0.5% savings account to a 7% investment return? **That’s an extra $100K+ over 20 years.** (No, that’s not a typo.)

You don’t need a windfall—you just need to **stop leaving money idle.**

\- boarding delayed at LHR by 30 min

\- flight estimated to be delayed by 40 min

\- landed at Delhi airport at 11:55am (IST)

\- made to wait in aircraft till 16:20pm (IST)

\- in aircraft for almost 4.5 hours

\- wait was due to smog in Delhi and nowhere for the aircraft to park

\- told by pilot we will deplane multiple times yet we did not

\- no refreshments, snacks or even water passed around

\- chaos in the aircraft (people missing connecting flights, elderly and sick people not having their medication or water to take medication with, etc)

\- flight attendant yelling at passenger and speaking rudely to them upon asking for water and updates

\- took 1.5 hour to get water for an elderly passenger near me

\- not allowed to use bathroom for first 1.5 hour after landing

\- WiFi shut off for the duration of being landed but in flight (they had free WiFi on board)

\- in an aircraft so obviously a lot of passengers including myself had no signal for the 4.5 hours we were there to contact anyone

Anyways, I raised a complaint for compensation to air india mentioning all of the above. They have asked for flight details which I provided (although id already sent this in my initial message). They have now replied to me after over a month with this email below:

We completely understand the concern, we would like to begin by extending our heartfelt empathy for the discomfort experienced.

Please be advised that despite our continuous efforts to operate all flights punctually, unforeseen circumstances may occasionally lead to last‑minute cancellations, delays, or disruptions. In this instance, the schedule of flight AI2018 from London to Mumbai was impacted due to operational reasons, including air traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, and airfield congestion. These factors resulted in a delay in the allocation of the parking bay, and the flight was held on the runway by officials until clearance was provided. Additionally, the schedule of the return flight AI111 from Delhi to London was also affected due to operational requirements.

While we completely understand the discomfort caused, we would like to share that during the prolonged ground holding period, the Captain made regular announcements to keep passengers informed of the situation. Considering the extended duration after landing, passengers were permitted to use the lavatories to ensure comfort. The onboard crew continuously monitored the cabin, maintained calm communication, and extended all possible assistance. Water bottles, tea/coffee, and cookies were distributed repeatedly as per availability; however, due to the extended delay of nearly four hours post‑landing, onboard stock was eventually limited which resulted into to delayed service.

Your feedback regarding the inflight cabin service, airport services is invaluable to us, as it helps us identify areas for improvement and take corrective measures to ensure a better experience for our guests in the future. We are committed to addressing the concerns you encountered and would like to assure you that immediate steps are being taken to strengthen our service delivery.

We strive to uphold the highest standards of service and adhere to all applicable regulations, including those set forth by the authorities. As per the regulations, compensation/reimbursement is inapplicable in cases where the delay is deemed to be beyond the control of the airline and falls within certain parameters specified by the authority. While we understand the concern and frustration that flight delays can cause however, we are unable to honor the request for compensation.

We hope for the opportunity to serve you again in the future. Your satisfaction remains our utmost priority, and we aim to regain your trust in Air India.

Please feel free to contact us in case any further assistance is required.

Am I able to claim any compensation at all for this or should I just let it go? I did pay £1K for this flight so I’m annoyed by the experience and how they handled it. To add, my flight back was delayed by an hour from departure at 06:15 to 07:30am as well.",1,1769003597.0,AskLegal,0,1.0,False

1qiyfok,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qiyfok/how_to_never_run_out_of_things_to_say_the/,How to Never Run Out of Things to Say: The Psychology of Flowing Conversation,"You know that awkward moment when you're talking to someone and suddenly... silence. Dead air. Your brain goes blank, and you're scrambling for literally anything to say. Maybe you panic and blurt out something about the weather, or worse, you just stand there sweating. Yeah, we've all been there.



Here's what nobody tells you: Running out of things to say isn't about being boring or not having interesting thoughts. It's about anxiety killing your natural flow. Your brain literally short-circuits when you're worried about saying the ""right"" thing. I've been down this rabbit hole, reading everything from communication research to behavioral psychology, listening to podcasts from conversation experts, watching hours of charisma breakdowns on YouTube. And honestly? Most advice sucks. It's either too technical or just tells you to ""be confident"" (thanks for nothing).



But there are actual techniques that work. Real, practical tools that transform how you communicate. Let me break it down.



 Step 1: Stop Trying to Be Interesting



This sounds backwards, but hear me out. When you're desperately trying to impress someone or say something clever, your brain freezes. You're so focused on performing that you forget to actually connect. 



The secret? Get genuinely curious about the other person. Stop thinking about what you'll say next and start actually listening. When you're truly interested in someone's answer, follow-up questions flow naturally. You don't need a script when you're genuinely engaged.



Try this: After someone answers a question, ask ""why"" or ""how"" about something they just said. They mention they hate their commute? Don't just nod. Ask what specifically makes it terrible. They love cooking? Ask how they got into it. Curiosity is your cheat code.



 Step 2: Use the FORD Method (But Make It Natural)



FORD stands for Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. These are universal conversation territories that work with literally anyone. But don't just robotically go through the list like you're conducting an interview.



Drop these naturally into conversation:



 Family: ""Do you have siblings? I'm curious because..."" (relates to something you were discussing)

 Occupation: ""What do you do? And more importantly, do you actually like it?"" (the second question is key)

 Recreation: ""What do you do when you're not working? Like, what actually recharges you?""

 Dreams: ""If money wasn't an issue, what would you be doing with your time?""



These aren't just small talk. They're depth charges. They give people permission to open up about what actually matters to them.



 Step 3: Master the Art of Storytelling Threads



Here's a game changer from Matt Abrahams' book ""Think Faster, Talk Smarter"" (Stanford professor, insanely good communicator, this book is a masterclass in spontaneous speaking). He talks about creating ""conversational threads"" you can pull on.



Every conversation has multiple threads. Someone mentions they went to college in Boston? That's not just one topic, that's like five threads: their major, why they chose that school, what Boston was like, if they'd go back, what they studied. Each thread branches into more threads.



Most people hear ""I went to college in Boston"" and just say ""cool"" and then panic about what to say next. Instead, grab a thread and follow it. The conversation builds itself.



 Step 4: Share Observations, Not Just Facts



When you run out of scripted questions, shift to observations. Comment on what's happening around you, the situation you're in, or something you noticed about them (nothing creepy, keep it light).



""This coffee shop has the weirdest music playlist"" or ""You seem like someone who has strong opinions about pineapple on pizza"" or ""I noticed you're reading \[book\], is it worth the hype?""



Observations create shared moments. You're not interrogating them, you're inviting them into your perspective. It feels more natural and less like an interview.



 Step 5: Embrace the Pause (Silence Isn't Your Enemy)



This might blow your mind: Silence is okay. Not every second needs to be filled with words. Research shows that brief pauses actually make conversations feel more thoughtful and authentic. When you panic and fill every gap with nervous chatter, you come across as anxious.



Try this experiment: Next time there's a pause, count to three before you speak. It feels long to you, but it's barely noticeable to them. And often, they'll jump in before you do. Comfortable silence is a sign of confidence.



 Step 6: Use the ""Yes, And"" Technique



This comes from improv comedy, but it's gold for conversations. Whatever someone says, accept it and build on it. Don't just agree or disagree, add something.



Them: ""I'm exhausted from work.""

You: ""Yeah, I feel that. What's been draining you the most?""



Them: ""I love hiking.""

You: ""Nice. What's the best trail you've done? I'm always looking for recommendations.""



""Yes, and"" keeps momentum going. It validates what they said while pushing the conversation forward. Check out the app [Ash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.slingshot.ashley.app&hl=en_IN) if you want to practice this, it's basically an AI conversation coach that helps you develop better communication habits through daily practice scenarios.



 Step 7: Have Go-To Stories Ready



This sounds scripted, but it's not. Think of 3-5 interesting or funny stories from your life that you can adapt to different situations. Not to recite them word for word, but to have mental anchors when your brain blanks.



These should be:

 Short (under 2 minutes)

 Relatable (not showing off)

 Open loops (they lead to questions)



Maybe it's about a terrible job you had, a weird travel experience, something embarrassing that happened. When conversation stalls, you can naturally drop in ""Oh man, that reminds me of this time when..."" 



The New York Times actually did a study on this, people who share personal stories (even small ones) are perceived as more likeable and trustworthy. Your stories become conversation fuel.



\## Step 8: Read More, Experience More, Become More Interesting



Real talk: If you're running out of things to say all the time, maybe you need to fill your mental reservoir. Boring inputs create boring outputs. If all you do is work, scroll TikTok, and sleep, you won't have much to draw from.



Start consuming interesting content. ""The Art of Conversation"" by Judy Apps is brilliant for understanding the psychology behind great dialogue. Apps breaks down why some people naturally command conversations and others struggle, backed by research and real examples.



Listen to podcasts like [Lex Fridman ](https://lexfridman.com/)or [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://www.youtube.com/timferriss) where you hear world-class conversationalists interview fascinating people. You'll absorb patterns, learn how they redirect conversations, how they dig deeper.



If you're short on time but still want to level up, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from communication books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio lessons on exactly what you want to improve. You can set a goal like ""become a more magnetic conversationalist as an introvert"" and it builds a custom learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are genuinely addictive, I use the sarcastic one during commutes. It connects insights from multiple sources so you're not just getting isolated tips but actual frameworks that build on each other.



Watch conversational analysis videos on YouTube. [Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/@Charismaoncommand) breaks down movie scenes and interviews showing exactly what makes dialogue engaging. You start noticing techniques you can use.



 Step 9: Ask ""Dumb"" Questions



People think they need to ask impressive questions. Wrong. The best questions are simple and direct. ""What's been on your mind lately?"" or ""What are you excited about right now?"" These seem basic but they're actually deep because they're open and genuine.



Don't overthink it. Sometimes ""tell me more about that"" is the most powerful thing you can say. It shows you're listening and interested. That's rarer than you think.



 Step 10: Practice, Fail, Learn, Repeat



You can't read your way to being a great conversationalist. You have to practice in real life. Start small. Chat with the barista, make small talk with coworkers, talk to strangers at events (yeah, it's uncomfortable at first).



Every conversation is practice. Some will be awkward. Some will flow beautifully. Both teach you something. The more reps you get, the more your brain builds conversational reflexes. It becomes less about ""what do I say?"" and more about naturally responding.



Track what works. After good conversations, think about what you did. After awkward ones, figure out where it went sideways. You're collecting data on yourself.



Look, here's the truth: Running out of things to say happens to everyone. The difference is some people panic and retreat, others lean into the discomfort and keep showing up. The more you practice being present and curious, the less you'll worry about filling silence. 



You've got this. Now go talk to someone and stop overthinking it.",1,1769003539.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False

Sales were okay at first from word of mouth and foot traffic, but with more competition opening up nearby, I needed to get serious about online presence. I did basic stuff like setting up a simple website with product photos and hours, and posting on social media a few times a week.

To take it further, I hired an seo company called Seologist last month for local optimization. They helped with keyword research focused on Toronto searches, fixed my site speed, and built some backlinks from local directories. It's early, but I'm seeing more website visits already.

Beyond SEO, I'm thinking about inventory management since we waste some stock on slow days, and maybe partnering with delivery apps to reach more customers without big fees.

We went on a senior school trip in September which lasted 10 days in Spain, and in the club a guy came up to me, he was super awkward, but i found out he knew me from insta(later admitted he saw me in halls and asked my classmates for ig. And then i remembered that he did follow me in march and added the songs i put on my highlights on his notes, liked my stories, added me on CF and spam, and congratulated my bday even if it was late). I also later found out he came up to my friend and said oh ik all of you but her, i like her posts i like her so she can wingman him. We were together for the last 3 days, went on walks, went shopping while he held my bags, hed say he liked me a lot, remembered like old insta stories and overall He was sweet, but already at the start, id wanna see him, or wed plan a date and hed say yes, then have an excuse. Tbh he did have a busy scedule, and strict parents(if i can believe that).

He never had a gf before and neither did i have a bf, and by his classmates reaction i could believe that he had no play(if his pick up lines on the night we net weren’t enough).We went on a walk 2 weeks in and we had our first kiss and made out. Now after that, no more gm or gn messages, and hed even leave me on seen or delivered. I brought it up, and we argued but he changed his attitude a bit. But u wanted to go to a cafe and soft launch us, he told me you have the balls to post that? I said why not, you wouldn’t? His excuse was he has family (we kept our relationship away from our parents, at least in my case its cuz they’re strict,but i dont think he had family on insta)and that he hates going to cafes and doesn’t get the point if hes gonna drink the coffee in one go and leave(id lit never see him with his friends at cafes, he seemed antisocial and most of the times went fishing w his cousin). So much so, that during sports day he said hed play then, actually didnt come but went fishing(i wanted to see him that day) and also made excuses that his parents never see him at home when i wanted that cafe date. So i got mad and said fine ill go with friends. I tried to plan him in again but he said he alr made plans to go fishing but when i sent a fit check he replied “something for the guys to look at”. After that, he was even more cold, like the last time he wasn’t acting that way was when we argued over the cafe date where hed lit write “no matter how mad u are i still love you” or “im just mad i let this happen”.

A few days pass, i break up, he takes me back, but not even a day later i want to see him for even 5 mins because i didn’t see him for 2 whole weeks and he says he has a dental appointment. So i believe him, go to school and see him walk out the class, now, even if he had an appointment at 1 pm and lied that he had at 12 30, i was still mad again, he lied to not meet with me, which is a constant problem after that date we had. He texts me “i was late because of you🙄” 5 mins later but i was already bummed out, and after arguing i asked, for the third time because he avoids the question, do you wanna break up. He says idc theres plenty of fish in the sea who can have time for you, and anything i complained about after hed say see another reason to find someone better. So we break up.

Im only coming back to this because i talked to my friends and they said that he was cheating, and that is messing with my head, esp when she said well while he was making excuses for you, he was seeing the other girl. Or that he was simply bored(which doesn’t make sense because, all his classmates did have flings on the trip and i couldve been one, but he indirectly and directly asked me to be his gf on it). And why he was bailing so much if both out classes knew we were dating? Id probably not go back but… its nessing w my head, like every date went well and esp the last one and he came back home and decided it wasn’t worth the effort.

1qiyc0p,https://v.redd.it/htoo4krqipeg1,here are some tips that i picked up when transitioning to veganism,"i know they’ll help you align your food choices with your heart

  
  
1. go for the direct swaps: plain unsweetened coconut yogurt instead of cow’s milk yogurts, almond milk creamer for your coffee, oat milk for your cereal and baking, seitan crumbles instead of ground animal for your tacos.

  
  
2. don’t be afraid of the unfamiliar vegan ingredients! nutritional yeast has become one of my favorite cheesy flavors for sauces, soups, and popcorn. vital wheat gluten makes high protein baked goods.

  
  
3. don’t let expectations to be a perfect vegan keep you from giving a plant powered life a try. every animal that you don’t eat and every nut milk that you buy instead sends a message and makes an impact on you, the animals, and the environment!

Everyone sees the fancy success stories, the IPOs, the tech bros sipping oat milk lattes, but lemme tell you about the grime, the sleepless nights, and the sheer 'what the hell are we even doing?' moments that built our little empire from absolute zero.

It started with me and my co-founder, Mark, crammed into my mom's perpetually damp basement. The air always smelled faintly of mildew and desperation, honestly. Our 'office' furniture was cobbled together from discarded IKEA pieces, and our coding fuel was exclusively instant ramen – extra spicy to keep us awake. We had this wild, probably insane, idea for a platform that would connect niche communities like never before, a place where everyone felt heard. We were buzzing with this naive excitement, fueled by cheap coffee and the sheer audacity of youth.

Then came the grind. Oh man, the grind. Days blurred into nights, weeks into months. My eyes constantly burned from staring at lines of code, and my fingers felt like they were permanently attached to the keyboard. We’d hit infuriating bugs that felt like brick walls, watching our limited savings dwindle, and there were so many moments I just wanted to throw my decrepit laptop across the room. Doubt crept in like a persistent fog – 'Are we wasting our lives? Is this idea even good? Should I just go back to my boring office job?' It was a constant battle against that internal voice whispering 'give up.'

But then, one random Tuesday, after weeks of absolutely zero traction, someone actually posted! A real person, not us! Then another, and another. It was a trickle, but that first wave of genuine user engagement felt like a jolt of pure electricity. We high-fived so hard we almost dislocated shoulders. That tiny spark of connection, seeing people actually *use* what we painstakingly built, kept us going through the subsequent years of endless pivots, server crashes, and the inevitable existential crises.

Fast forward to today, and that damp basement project is, well, not in a damp basement anymore. It's still a wild ride, and the problems just get bigger, but the core thrill of creating something that connects people? That's still there, burning just as bright as it did on those ramen-fueled nights. It's a testament to stubbornness, caffeine, and maybe a little bit of magic.

So, for all you aspiring founders out there, what was your most absurd, 'this is never going to work' moment that actually ended up being a turning point?",1,1769003145.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Do I send one more message?","I’m 29M in a big city, matched with her (27F) on Hinge about three weeks ago. We hit it off fast and the texting felt mutual, not like I was dragging it along. Daily messages, a couple voice notes, dumb memes, even a short call one night because she said typing at work was annoying. After about a week she suggested we actually meet, which I took as a good sign. We did drinks last Friday, ended up talking for almost 3 hours, then grabbed tacos because we both realized we hadn’t eaten. It wasn’t an interview vibe at all. We joked about the bar’s playlist, talked siblings, travel, and random “what were you like in high school” stuff. She made a point of asking follow-ups, like she was really listening. At the end she kissed me first, and when she got home she texted that she had fun and we should do it again. I replied that I did too and suggested a coffee spot we’d mentioned, she said “yes, definitely” and that her week might be a bit hectic but she’d figure it out.

Since then it’s been confusing. Saturday we exchanged a few light texts about the taco place and she sent a selfie from her couch, I responded and she sent a laughing emoji. Sunday she sent a photo from a walk and I replied, she reacted with a heart. Monday I sent a casual “hope your Monday isn’t awful” and she liked it but didn’t answer. I didn’t follow up because I don’t want to be the guy who keeps poking when someone’s not responding. Now it’s Friday again and it’s been 4 full days with zero words from her. No “busy week”, no “sorry”, nothing. I get that people get busy, but if you’re into someone you can usually fire off one sentence, right? I also don’t want to play the cool-guy game where you pretend you don’t care when you do. Would you send one more text that gives her an easy out, or do you take 4 days of silence as the answer and move on. If you would text, what would you actually say so it doesn’t sound needy or salty?

April 1. 6:00 A.M.

I did it! I made my escape last night. Those haymakers I practiced on Billy 'Bucktooth' really paid off in the end. I cocked that guard right in the sweet spot of the jaw like Dad taught me. I still can't believe I hoisted the other guard over my shoulders like a WWF wrestler. I managed to steal the wallet off the guard I knocked out. He had a couple hundred bucks stashed away in there. I took the paper and ditched the leather. No use having his license and photos of his own kids. I got out of there just as dark was settling in over the city, letting my legs carry me in which ever direction I randomly chose to get as much distance away. I ended up in a shady part of town. I managed to save some money in a shifty looking thrift store for some clothes. I was able to find a nice thick, black trenchcoat to keep me warm was I roamed the streets, a black beanie to top it off.  The nights are still cold. I kind of look homeless in the store glass reflection. When the beard and hair grew in this morning, it didn't help my case. I spent a majority of what I had left on some food, cigarettes, and a cheap hotel room. Getting the smokes was easier than I thought. The guy never asked for an ID. Guess I'm looking old enough to not even be bothered to be asked for one. I'm still here in the hotel room with no idea what to do next. I panicked when I took the chance to get out of that hellhole last night, but I felt I had no choice. Being there felt more haunting than what's happening to me. I'm glad to not be there anymore. Only plan I can come up with right now is to go back home. I'm going to have to sneak in when Dad goes off to work and Mom is probably going to polish off another bottle and pass out. I'm going to need some supplies and different clothes. More money as well. I know where Mom hides her 'secret savings' at that she keeps from Dad. It should hold me over until I can find some answers. If I'm able to accomplish all that, I guess next is to check out the area where the church was at. If her funeral was there, then someone around that neighborhood should know something. It's not too far away from the street Elena died at as well.

April 2. 7:10 A.M.

I was able to manage to spend another night here in this grimey, sleazy hotel. Sleep was almost impossible. I heard people shouting and fighting last night in another room for hours. The city noises outside were loud and obnoxious. This place didn't bother me so much the other night, probably because I was exhausted from my thrilling escape. But last night was the first night I felt truly alone. It weighed on me as much as the curse. I just got back from getting some breakfast and my back feels stiff today. I feel even more heavier. After examining myself in the grueling bathroom mirror, I had gotten fatter. My stomach and chest were small mounds of blubber. My arms and legs are bigger as well. I look like I've done nothing but consume fast food all my life. I can see strands of white hairs in my beard now. I swiped some scissors from a store clerk yesterday who wasn't looking. I won't be able to shave, but I'm trying my best to keep it managed. The bald spot on my head is expanding. I found hairs on my pillow when I awoke earlier. It's going to be harder to sneak into my house now. There's no way I'm climbing up to my window in this sloppy body. I figured out how to get back to my cul-de-sac when I asked around today. It's going to take me a few hours to get there by foot. I'm heading out after I finish up here. Dad should already be on his way to work and it will take some time until Mom is depressed enough to take an afternoon wine nap.

April 2. 11:40 P.M.

I can't believe that BITCH! My own mother! Let's say I managed to mostly fulfill my almost flawless plan without a hitch. It took me longer than I had thought to get into my neighborhood. Jumping the backyard fence was a harder chore as well. My ankles felt like they were on fire after I landed on the ground. I almost fell over from the pain. Instead of climbing up to my window, I took the easier route in, the hidden key under the creepy lawn gnome for the side kitchen door. I crept in as quietly as I could muster, but the house was quiet itself. I looked around and no Mom. I looked in the garage and both hers and Dad's cars were gone. I didn't know how much time I had so I hopped into action gathering what I could as fast I could. I got Mom's money stash. Nearly fifteen hundred dollars was there. This was enough to get me by for good while. I went up to my room to grab my backpack and some bathing supplies. I also took some of Dad's razors to maintain my face at least. As I started raiding the cupboards in the kitchen for dry goods to stuff in the backpack, Mom approached me from behind scaring me to almost age even faster than I already am. She was just as scared as me. I had to show her my scar again to prove it was me. ""Oh my God Tommy,"", she started to cry, ""...look at you! What's become of you? The doctors. They wouldn't let us see you. They called yesterday saying you escaped injuring two guards? What's going Tommy?!"" Her words became more incoherent as she went on. Her makeup was running badly from the tears. ""What are you doing in here?"" We sat down for a few minutes after I calmed her down. I told her everything. I couldn't tell if she believed me or not. It seems telling the truth isn't getting me anywhere. She didn't say much. She got up to go to the bathroom, said she had to wipe her nose. After a few minutes she came back and sat with me, telling me everything was going to be alright. Then I heard the cars suddenly squealing their tires to a stop just outside the front of the house. She called them. She must of went into her room and used the phone on the nightstand. That traitorous bitch! I snatched up the backpack and rushed out the sliding door windows that lead directly to the backyard. Good thing I threw my bike over the fence before I broke into the house. I got to it and took off like the wind down the alleyways. I'm posted in the hideout me and the boys found along the river now. It's an old cement shack-like structure, just a single small room. Good enough for a quick shelter. We never knew how it got here but we treated it like our basecamp when we pretended we were on space adventures. It started to rain as I got here. Guess I'm not making a fire in here if I don't want to die from too much smoke inhalation. I also forgot to grab some extra clothes from Dad's dressers as I was taking Mom's cash. Such a day. I'm so cold and exhausted.

April 5. 2:00 P.M.

This rain has been relentless. I've been stuck here in this 'shack' now for the last couple days. It coming down like 'cats and dogs' out there. The other night it picked up into a fully fledged shit storm. During the night I could swear I heard Elena's cackling laughter in the midst of booming thunder and burst of lightning ripping apart the sky above. Sleeping has never been so elusive from me. I awoke this morning to my beard being past my chest now. I haven't had a mirror to keep it maintained. Instead of growing in my body, I seem to be getting skinnier now. I do look like a homeless person at this point. The wind was steady last night to keep a fire's smoke from clouding up the room and be circulated out the open window. It kept the room quite warm. It brought a little bit of comforting relief. I went through most of my food. I was only able to grab up some canned soups, a few bags of chips, and a full box of my favorite cereal. The thin cardboard of the Lucky Charms box came in handy as kindling for the fire. Hopefully this endless rain calms down soon so I can make some moves today. I'm not getting any younger.

April 6. 12:35 P.M.

This weekend didn't start off too well. The rain finally let up sometime in the early morning while I was getting some kind of sleep. I kept hearing what Elena said to me over and over, my mind racing around and around. When I stood up, my body felt thinner but deep down I felt heavier. My bones crack from every move I make and my back is even stiffer now. My hair is so long and greasy. I need to cut it and get a shower. As I started to prepare for my departure from my most recent place of residence, by some cosmic coincidence, Tommy and Fritz showed up outside the hideout. I heard both their voices as they approached the old wooden door. My blood ran cold. Fritz swung the door open and both boys were shocked at my presence there. ""What are you doing in our hideout dude?"", Johnny flared out. ""He's probably some hobo that needed a place to get out of rain to shoot up his dope."", Fritz answered. Johnny replied to him looking to me, ""Well if that's the case, rains gone hobo! Get the fuck outta here!"", he demanded of me. He then noticed the MONGOOSE leaned up against the wall next to me. ""That's Tommy's bike. What are you doing with Tommy's bike hobo?!"" I put hands up in surrender to show I was of no danger. ""Guys! It's ME! Tommy!"", I said to them. ""What the fuck you talking about dude?!"", Johnny lashed out. ""Look I know it seems weird"", I started to explain, ""but you got to believe it's me!"" I began to say how Fritz's real name was Gilligan Fritzer, but he always hated being called Gilligan so we dubbed him 'Fritz' and how Johnny saved me from bleeding out when I fell on a sharp tool blade during a school field trip resulting in the big scar on my back. He used his jacket to press on the opening to keep me awake as he screamed for help. I presented it to them to prove it further. I told him how I swore I would always have his back for that. That we were the bestest of friends. Johnny looked to Fritz, nodded and looked back to me. They both bent down to pick up the metal pipes we had stashed there and readied themselves. ""Look mister, your not Tommy! He's in the hospital severly sick right now. You need to get your nasty hobo ass out of here!"" They didn't believe me. Before I could say anymore, Fritz was bending back down to pick up a rock, hurling it to my head connecting and leaving me fuzzing out for a few seconds. When I got my focus I grabbed my backpack and the bike and kicked up leftover pieces of smoldering wood, distracting them long enough for me to slip past and make my escape as they kept pelting me with more rocks, Johnny screaming, ""Give back the bike you thieving asshole!"" I kept going not looking back. I returned to the sleazy hotel again now. Same room as before. Me and desk clerk are starting to become too familiar with one another. I reserved the room for a week so I have some safe place to come back to for the time being. The rain is starting again.

April 8. 1:30 A.M.

Lavinia. That's her name. The exotic woman in black I encountered at the funeral. I found her tonight. The rain hasn't slowed down at all since it started up again yesterday. So, I found the determination to wander out and find some answers. I bought an umbrella in a dainty shop across the street from the hotel and made my way to the neighborhood where the church was. I went around asking multiple shop keeps and random people on the street if they knew Elena or knew of anyone who would know of her. I couldn't get any answers. Everyone acted as if they didn't know English. No one would barely make eye contact with me, and the few that did shied away after mentioning her name. I was getting nowhere. Between the depression and fear this curse has me under, I went and had ""some"" drinks when I gave up asking around. I just went into some random pub. I don't remember the name of it. Going in I felt tense, never being inside an alcohol establishment before. I made my way to the tall seats going around the bar table. The bartender barely paying me any mind while cleaning out a glass mug as I sat. I asked for any beer waving a twenty and he obliged me with no problems. All the gray and white on my face allowed me prevention from being carded I guess. Nightfall came eventually. I found myself in a stupor sitting at that bar. Slogging my words as they came out to the bartender when I ordered for another round. My anger towards my situation was getting the better of me and showing in my voice. I could tell the bartender was beginning to get agitated with me. I didn't care. There wasn't many customers. As I sat there, a man not far from me in one of the booths starting repeating something. His voice was low at first. Then his voice raised louder as he slowly made eye contact with me. ""...mai in varsta."" Those words. The same from the nightmare in the metal hallway. ""MAI IN VARSTA!"" He was screaming at this point, not moving from his seat, just sitting there with his mug of beer in hand, locking his attention at me. Then suddenly, the remaining customers there began chanting the same as well in unison, looking directly at me. I scoped around terrified from their banter, not moving a muscle except for their mouths. The bartender was in on it as well. He just stood there on his side of the bar as he wiped down a glass. How cold it felt to have all their eyes on me. I ran out of there as fast I could, stumbling my way like a drunkard down the dark city streets. I came around a corner to a group of men laughing outside another pub. They were surrounding one individual I knew all too well, enjoying their cancer sticks. His face paint was smeared and he didn't have his iconic red nose on. It was the birthday clown still in uniform. As I went to pass them, I fumbled to the ground not being able to catch my balance. The clown started pointing and laughing hysterically at me as I looked up to them hardly catching any air in my lungs. His friends joyfully joined in the second after. He couldn't help but grab at his stomach from the pain his own outburst was causing him, but he didn't seem to care. They just kept laughing at me as I picked myself up and walked away concentrating on my steps.

The rain began again and I had forgotten the umbrella back the pub. Stupid on my part. I made it a couple blocks before I found myself losing my feet, slipping to the ground in front of a random shop. I landed on my side and rolled over to my back being blinded by the orange and yellow neon lights shining from the shop window. The words read 'Palm Readings' with a eye logo below them. I couldn't see inside past the dark red velvet curtains inches away on the other end of the glass. I made a drunken decision to go inside and see if anyone would let me hang out for bit to dry and to see if the rain stops. A bell chimed to my entrance. I stood there for a few moments trying to still keep my balance before I heard the tapping of heels make their way to the open doorway behind a shotty desk. It was her that emerged from the bead curtains that hung down. My eyelids hurt from how wide I was stretching them from my surprise. ""Tommy boy."", she began. She didn't appear to be as surprised as myself. Her voice was calm. ""I've been expecting you my darlings."" ""You have been"", I suddenly interrupted myself by belching, ""expecting me?"" She giggled at this. ""Darlings, look where you are. Of course I've been expecting you. I have been waiting for this moment. I just wasn't too sures on when it was going to come. Follow me darlings, let's get you out of those wet clothes."", she said as she curled her finger to beckon me to the back room. I willfully followed. I thought maybe I was finally going to get some answers. Maybe she would help me. I was so wrong. She offered me a coffee, I never had coffee before. I declined the offer and still she persisted to give me some sort of beverage. I asked for tea if she had it. She did. She went to another room to fetch me the drink, coming back swaying her hips to her own rhythm. ""Let me get those soaking rags off you darlings to dry a bits."", she said reaching her hands out after placing the cup of liquid on the table in front of me. I said no thanks, that I was fine. ""Then at least let us have your big coat here, you can relax darlings."" I agreed with her and let her take off the trenchcoat to hang on a hook next the beaded curtain we come from. ""Come, sit."" We both sat down on cushioned chairs to a small rounded table with a fiery red velvet shawl draped across it. Golden stitchings lined the borders of the cloth with intricate designs. It was just my cup of tea and an ashtray atop of it. I sipped on the tea as she sat directly across from me wedging a fresh cigarette into the stick filter of hers. ""Would you mind?"", she asked looking to me. I frantically reached for the lighter in my pocket and assisted her. ""Such the gentleman. Guess you are only polite when it comes to beautiful women and not fragile ol' ladies?"" Her words shook me like an earthquake. ""Look.."", my words trembled from my lips, ""...I'm so sorry."" She suddenly interrupted me slamming her fist on the table, ""NO! Your nots sorry!"", she took a deep inhale of her cigarette, letting the smoke roll slowly out as she exhaled it all and calmly said, ""...nots yet anyways.""

She stood up, seductively catwalking over, looking down to me. ""I know why your here. I know what it is thats wrongs with you. You deserve what you have coming. The best pain is the pain you learns from!"" The words stolen right from Dad's mouth. She bent forward a little as if to get a better look at me. ""But this IS fascinating I must say. I've heard of this curse, but it has not latched to anyone in a very long times. It takes a certain, what is the word, circumstance for this curse to occur. You, dear Tommy boy, brought this upon yourselfs when you distracted my gran-ma-ma with your vulgar words that got her killed."" ""I didn't kill her!"", I shouted back. ""You may has well have."", she replied contently. ""She knew her death was to come that day. But she didn't know how violently and grudgefully it would be. Fate was not kind to her that day..."" A small tear shed from her eye, tracing a line of black from her makeup along with it. She wiped it away with her free hand, ""...as it wasn't for you either. Gran-ma-ma wasn't a saint, but she didn't deserve that ending."" ""How does this stop?"", I asked sobbingly. I couldn't hold it back anymore. ""Oh darlings..."", she began to answer as she playfully ran her fingers on my chest, ""...it stops when you stop..."" The last of those words was when I began to feel a strong wooziness wash over me. I could feel numbness in my legs and hands. I think she drugged the tea. ""...and I need you stop soon my darlings, so that gran-ma-ma can finally rest."" She pushed me easily backwards along with the chair I sat on to the floor. I couldn't move a muscle. I was paralyzed. Looking up to her as she stepped one foot over my body, I watch as she stripped herself of the dress she wore, exposing her perfect naked figure to me. ""Don't you worrys Tommy boy..."", she said as she lowered herself to straddle me, ""...Lavinia is going to make you feel all betters."" She rustled with my pants and suddenly I felt a wet like warmth at my groin. Was this sex? She rubbed herself on top of me back and forth, the terrifying pleasure of it had me closing my eyes, hoping this wasn't real. I opened them back up not the beautiful woman with a mole on her face, but to Elena! Her zombie formed appearance was worse than ever now. Skin was melting all over showing dry crusted bone, puss and blood ran from open cysts, her eyes had no pupils but were yellowed over, steaming like they were about to boil. She cackled and hooted as she kept violently rubbing against my torso. I could also hear the Lavinia woman's giggle from all around me like an echo. I found the strength to hurl her off and make my way out back into the rain. The horror of it all left me lost in streets once again. I finally found my way back to hotel. The experience has me completely sober and wide awake now. I'm not getting any sleep tonight.",1,1769002925.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

First I will start with **my setup**:  
Machine: Sage Barista Express  
Grinder: DF64 (default burrs)

**Background:** 

I buy my coffee beans from a local coffee shop and have always been very happy with the taste I get from my setup. However, when I ordered a latte directly at the shop, it tasted on a completely different level. I could clearly identify the flavors, and the overall experience was much more pleasant.

When I asked which beans they used, I was surprised to learn that they were the same ones I buy. Despite that, the difference in taste was so significant that it felt like I was drinking an entirely different coffee.

Ever since then I am trying to chase that taste, but can not achieve it and I hoped to find some answers here...

**My recipe:**

I’m using a Sage Barista Express, which has a smaller portafilter, so I usually go with a 17 g dose and a 34 g yield. I tried increasing the yield (from 34 g up to 37 g) to add more intensity, but that didn’t help.

Their coffee tasted less bitter, so I shortened my usual extraction time from 25 seconds to 20 seconds to increase acidity, but it was still nowhere near the taste I’m trying to achieve. I started running out of ideas and even used their cup to double-check that our ratios were the same.

**Questions:** 

* What do you think could help me achieve that clearer taste?
* Could it be because I’m using a DF64 with stock burrs?
* Do I need a better coffee machine that can extract more flavor from the coffee?
* Is there something wrong with my recipe?",3,1769002817.0,espresso,10,0.8,False

Could he please take his dirty clothes and put them in the   hamper but he leaves  them on the counter by the changing table every time the hamper is literally 5 feet away. He will leave all his dirty dishes just on counter instead of placing it in dishes, I’ve asked repeatedly for him to please put In dish washer if its dirty we even have a sign on the dishwasher saying if its cleaner or dirty so he doesn’t have to question it. I wouldn’t be as upsets over these thing but since having our second child in October of 2025 I have felt like I’m drowning and can never catch up my son is into everything and I swear the second I turn around and look back it o shit no bud. The one that pushed me over the edge this morning while I made my coffee and saw his cereal bowl left on my counter. My son‘s clothes left on the counter dirty and go to   the fridge to get my creamer and there’s hard boiled eggs that he made the night prior that had all cracked open and when he was making them, I had told him oh it’s OK They cracked They just need to be cover and to put them in a plastic container. Please just cover them and sure enough they are just placed in bowl in fridge. 

anytime I bring up to him that he need to try harder to hear what I say he says tha it’s not his fault he can’t remember and I need to deal with it.

April 1. 6:00 A.M.

I did it! I made my escape last night. Those haymakers I practiced on Billy 'Bucktooth' really paid off in the end. I cocked that guard right in the sweet spot of the jaw like Dad taught me. I still can't believe I hoisted the other guard over my shoulders like a WWF wrestler. I managed to steal the wallet off the guard I knocked out. He had a couple hundred bucks stashed away in there. I took the paper and ditched the leather. No use having his license and photos of his own kids. I got out of there just as dark was settling in over the city, letting my legs carry me in which ever direction I randomly chose to get as much distance away. I ended up in a shady part of town. I managed to save some money in a shifty looking thrift store for some clothes. I was able to find a nice thick, black trenchcoat to keep me warm was I roamed the streets, a black beanie to top it off.  The nights are still cold. I kind of look homeless in the store glass reflection. When the beard and hair grew in this morning, it didn't help my case. I spent a majority of what I had left on some food, cigarettes, and a cheap hotel room. Getting the smokes was easier than I thought. The guy never asked for an ID. Guess I'm looking old enough to not even be bothered to be asked for one. I'm still here in the hotel room with no idea what to do next. I panicked when I took the chance to get out of that hellhole last night, but I felt I had no choice. Being there felt more haunting than what's happening to me. I'm glad to not be there anymore. Only plan I can come up with right now is to go back home. I'm going to have to sneak in when Dad goes off to work and Mom is probably going to polish off another bottle and pass out. I'm going to need some supplies and different clothes. More money as well. I know where Mom hides her 'secret savings' at that she keeps from Dad. It should hold me over until I can find some answers. If I'm able to accomplish all that, I guess next is to check out the area where the church was at. If her funeral was there, then someone around that neighborhood should know something. It's not too far away from the street Elena died at as well.

April 2. 7:10 A.M.

I was able to manage to spend another night here in this grimey, sleazy hotel. Sleep was almost impossible. I heard people shouting and fighting last night in another room for hours. The city noises outside were loud and obnoxious. This place didn't bother me so much the other night, probably because I was exhausted from my thrilling escape. But last night was the first night I felt truly alone. It weighed on me as much as the curse. I just got back from getting some breakfast and my back feels stiff today. I feel even more heavier. After examining myself in the grueling bathroom mirror, I had gotten fatter. My stomach and chest were small mounds of blubber. My arms and legs are bigger as well. I look like I've done nothing but consume fast food all my life. I can see strands of white hairs in my beard now. I swiped some scissors from a store clerk yesterday who wasn't looking. I won't be able to shave, but I'm trying my best to keep it managed. The bald spot on my head is expanding. I found hairs on my pillow when I awoke earlier. It's going to be harder to sneak into my house now. There's no way I'm climbing up to my window in this sloppy body. I figured out how to get back to my cul-de-sac when I asked around today. It's going to take me a few hours to get there by foot. I'm heading out after I finish up here. Dad should already be on his way to work and it will take some time until Mom is depressed enough to take an afternoon wine nap.

April 2. 11:40 P.M.

I can't believe that BITCH! My own mother! Let's say I managed to mostly fulfill my almost flawless plan without a hitch. It took me longer than I had thought to get into my neighborhood. Jumping the backyard fence was a harder chore as well. My ankles felt like they were on fire after I landed on the ground. I almost fell over from the pain. Instead of climbing up to my window, I took the easier route in, the hidden key under the creepy lawn gnome for the side kitchen door. I crept in as quietly as I could muster, but the house was quiet itself. I looked around and no Mom. I looked in the garage and both hers and Dad's cars were gone. I didn't know how much time I had so I hopped into action gathering what I could as fast I could. I got Mom's money stash. Nearly fifteen hundred dollars was there. This was enough to get me by for good while. I went up to my room to grab my backpack and some bathing supplies. I also took some of Dad's razors to maintain my face at least. As I started raiding the cupboards in the kitchen for dry goods to stuff in the backpack, Mom approached me from behind scaring me to almost age even faster than I already am. She was just as scared as me. I had to show her my scar again to prove it was me. ""Oh my God Tommy,"", she started to cry, ""...look at you! What's become of you? The doctors. They wouldn't let us see you. They called yesterday saying you escaped injuring two guards? What's going Tommy?!"" Her words became more incoherent as she went on. Her makeup was running badly from the tears. ""What are you doing in here?"" We sat down for a few minutes after I calmed her down. I told her everything. I couldn't tell if she believed me or not. It seems telling the truth isn't getting me anywhere. She didn't say much. She got up to go to the bathroom, said she had to wipe her nose. After a few minutes she came back and sat with me, telling me everything was going to be alright. Then I heard the cars suddenly squealing their tires to a stop just outside the front of the house. She called them. She must of went into her room and used the phone on the nightstand. That traitorous bitch! I snatched up the backpack and rushed out the sliding door windows that lead directly to the backyard. Good thing I threw my bike over the fence before I broke into the house. I got to it and took off like the wind down the alleyways. I'm posted in the hideout me and the boys found along the river now. It's an old cement shack-like structure, just a single small room. Good enough for a quick shelter. We never knew how it got here but we treated it like our basecamp when we pretended we were on space adventures. It started to rain as I got here. Guess I'm not making a fire in here if I don't want to die from too much smoke inhalation. I also forgot to grab some extra clothes from Dad's dressers as I was taking Mom's cash. Such a day. I'm so cold and exhausted.

April 5. 2:00 P.M.

This rain has been relentless. I've been stuck here in this 'shack' now for the last couple days. It coming down like 'cats and dogs' out there. The other night it picked up into a fully fledged shit storm. During the night I could swear I heard Elena's cackling laughter in the midst of booming thunder and burst of lightning ripping apart the sky above. Sleeping has never been so elusive from me. I awoke this morning to my beard being past my chest now. I haven't had a mirror to keep it maintained. Instead of growing in my body, I seem to be getting skinnier now. I do look like a homeless person at this point. The wind was steady last night to keep a fire's smoke from clouding up the room and be circulated out the open window. It kept the room quite warm. It brought a little bit of comforting relief. I went through most of my food. I was only able to grab up some canned soups, a few bags of chips, and a full box of my favorite cereal. The thin cardboard of the Lucky Charms box came in handy as kindling for the fire. Hopefully this endless rain calms down soon so I can make some moves today. I'm not getting any younger.

April 6. 12:35 P.M.

This weekend didn't start off too well. The rain finally let up sometime in the early morning while I was getting some kind of sleep. I kept hearing what Elena said to me over and over, my mind racing around and around. When I stood up, my body felt thinner but deep down I felt heavier. My bones crack from every move I make and my back is even stiffer now. My hair is so long and greasy. I need to cut it and get a shower. As I started to prepare for my departure from my most recent place of residence, by some cosmic coincidence, Tommy and Fritz showed up outside the hideout. I heard both their voices as they approached the old wooden door. My blood ran cold. Fritz swung the door open and both boys were shocked at my presence there. ""What are you doing in our hideout dude?"", Johnny flared out. ""He's probably some hobo that needed a place to get out of rain to shoot up his dope."", Fritz answered. Johnny replied to him looking to me, ""Well if that's the case, rains gone hobo! Get the fuck outta here!"", he demanded of me. He then noticed the MONGOOSE leaned up against the wall next to me. ""That's Tommy's bike. What are you doing with Tommy's bike hobo?!"" I put hands up in surrender to show I was of no danger. ""Guys! It's ME! Tommy!"", I said to them. ""What the fuck you talking about dude?!"", Johnny lashed out. ""Look I know it seems weird"", I started to explain, ""but you got to believe it's me!"" I began to say how Fritz's real name was Gilligan Fritzer, but he always hated being called Gilligan so we dubbed him 'Fritz' and how Johnny saved me from bleeding out when I fell on a sharp tool blade during a school field trip resulting in the big scar on my back. He used his jacket to press on the opening to keep me awake as he screamed for help. I presented it to them to prove it further. I told him how I swore I would always have his back for that. That we were the bestest of friends. Johnny looked to Fritz, nodded and looked back to me. They both bent down to pick up the metal pipes we had stashed there and readied themselves. ""Look mister, your not Tommy! He's in the hospital severly sick right now. You need to get your nasty hobo ass out of here!"" They didn't believe me. Before I could say anymore, Fritz was bending back down to pick up a rock, hurling it to my head connecting and leaving me fuzzing out for a few seconds. When I got my focus I grabbed my backpack and the bike and kicked up leftover pieces of smoldering wood, distracting them long enough for me to slip past and make my escape as they kept pelting me with more rocks, Johnny screaming, ""Give back the bike you thieving asshole!"" I kept going not looking back. I returned to the sleazy hotel again now. Same room as before. Me and desk clerk are starting to become too familiar with one another. I reserved the room for a week so I have some safe place to come back to for the time being. The rain is starting again.

April 8. 1:30 A.M.

Lavinia. That's her name. The exotic woman in black I encountered at the funeral. I found her tonight. The rain hasn't slowed down at all since it started up again yesterday. So, I found the determination to wander out and find some answers. I bought an umbrella in a dainty shop across the street from the hotel and made my way to the neighborhood where the church was. I went around asking multiple shop keeps and random people on the street if they knew Elena or knew of anyone who would know of her. I couldn't get any answers. Everyone acted as if they didn't know English. No one would barely make eye contact with me, and the few that did shied away after mentioning her name. I was getting nowhere. Between the depression and fear this curse has me under, I went and had ""some"" drinks when I gave up asking around. I just went into some random pub. I don't remember the name of it. Going in I felt tense, never being inside an alcohol establishment before. I made my way to the tall seats going around the bar table. The bartender barely paying me any mind while cleaning out a glass mug as I sat. I asked for any beer waving a twenty and he obliged me with no problems. All the gray and white on my face allowed me prevention from being carded I guess. Nightfall came eventually. I found myself in a stupor sitting at that bar. Slogging my words as they came out to the bartender when I ordered for another round. My anger towards my situation was getting the better of me and showing in my voice. I could tell the bartender was beginning to get agitated with me. I didn't care. There wasn't many customers. As I sat there, a man not far from me in one of the booths starting repeating something. His voice was low at first. Then his voice raised louder as he slowly made eye contact with me. ""...mai in varsta."" Those words. The same from the nightmare in the metal hallway. ""MAI IN VARSTA!"" He was screaming at this point, not moving from his seat, just sitting there with his mug of beer in hand, locking his attention at me. Then suddenly, the remaining customers there began chanting the same as well in unison, looking directly at me. I scoped around terrified from their banter, not moving a muscle except for their mouths. The bartender was in on it as well. He just stood there on his side of the bar as he wiped down a glass. How cold it felt to have all their eyes on me. I ran out of there as fast I could, stumbling my way like a drunkard down the dark city streets. I came around a corner to a group of men laughing outside another pub. They were surrounding one individual I knew all too well, enjoying their cancer sticks. His face paint was smeared and he didn't have his iconic red nose on. It was the birthday clown still in uniform. As I went to pass them, I fumbled to the ground not being able to catch my balance. The clown started pointing and laughing hysterically at me as I looked up to them hardly catching any air in my lungs. His friends joyfully joined in the second after. He couldn't help but grab at his stomach from the pain his own outburst was causing him, but he didn't seem to care. They just kept laughing at me as I picked myself up and walked away concentrating on my steps.

The rain began again and I had forgotten the umbrella back the pub. Stupid on my part. I made it a couple blocks before I found myself losing my feet, slipping to the ground in front of a random shop. I landed on my side and rolled over to my back being blinded by the orange and yellow neon lights shining from the shop window. The words read 'Palm Readings' with a eye logo below them. I couldn't see inside past the dark red velvet curtains inches away on the other end of the glass. I made a drunken decision to go inside and see if anyone would let me hang out for bit to dry and to see if the rain stops. A bell chimed to my entrance. I stood there for a few moments trying to still keep my balance before I heard the tapping of heels make their way to the open doorway behind a shotty desk. It was her that emerged from the bead curtains that hung down. My eyelids hurt from how wide I was stretching them from my surprise. ""Tommy boy."", she began. She didn't appear to be as surprised as myself. Her voice was calm. ""I've been expecting you my darlings."" ""You have been"", I suddenly interupted myself by belching, ""expecting me?"" She giggled at this. ""Darlings, look where you are. Of course I've been expecting you. I have been waiting for this moment. I just wasn't too sures on when it was going to come. Follow me darlings, let's get you out of those wet clothes."", she said as she curled her finger to beckon me to the back room. I willfully followed. I thought maybe I was finally going to get some answers. Maybe she would help me. I was so wrong. She offered me a coffee, I never had coffee before. I declined the offer and still she persisted to give me some sort of beverage. I asked for tea if she had it. She did. She went to another room to fetch me the drink, coming back swaying her hips to her own rhythm. ""Let me get those soaking rags off you darlings to dry a bits."", she said reaching her hands out after placing the cup of liquid on the table in front of me. I said no thanks, that I was fine. ""Then at least let us have your big coat here, you can relax darlings."" I agreed with her and let her take off the trenchcoat to hang on a hook next the beaded curtain we come from. ""Come, sit."" We both sat down on cushioned chairs to a small rounded table with a fiery red velvet shawl draped across it. Golden stitchings lined the borders of the cloth with intricate designs. It was just my cup of tea and an ashtray atop of it. I sipped on the tea as she sat directly across from me wedging a fresh cigarette into the stick filter of hers. ""Would you mind?"", she asked looking to me. I frantically reached for the lighter in my pocket and assisted her. ""Such the gentleman. Guess you are only polite when it comes to beautiful women and not fragile ol' ladies?"" Her words shook me like an earthquake. ""Look.."", my words trembled from my lips, ""...I'm so sorry."" She suddenly interrupted me slamming her fist on the table, ""NO! Your nots sorry!"", she took a deep inhale of her cigarette, letting the smoke roll slowly out as she exhaled it all and calmly said, ""...nots yet anyways.""

She stood up, seductively catwalking over, looking down to me. ""I know why your here. I know what it is thats wrongs with you. You deserve what you have coming. The best pain is the pain you learns from!"" The words stolen right from Dad's mouth. She bent forward a little as if to get a better look at me. ""But this IS fascinating I must say. I've heard of this curse, but it has not latched to anyone in a very long times. It takes a certain, what is the word, circumstance for this curse to occur. You, dear Tommy boy, brought this upon yourselfs when you distracted my gran-ma-ma with your vulgar words that got her killed."" ""I didn't kill her!"", I shouted back. ""You may has well have."", she replied contently. ""She knew her death was to come that day. But she didn't know how violently and grudgefully it would be. Fate was not kind to her that day..."" A small tear shed from her eye, tracing a line of black from her makeup along with it. She wiped it away with her free hand, ""...as it wasn't for you either. Gran-ma-ma wasn't a saint, but she didn't deserve that ending."" ""How does this stop?"", I asked sobbingly. I couldn't hold it back anymore. ""Oh darlings..."", she began to answer as she playfully ran her fingers on my chest, ""...it stops when you stop..."" The last of those words was when I began to feel a strong wooziness wash over me. I could feel numbness in my legs and hands. I think she drugged the tea. ""...and I need you stop soon my darlings, so that gran-ma-ma can finally rest."" She pushed me easily backwards along with the chair I sat on to the floor. I couldn't move a muscle. I was paralyzed. Looking up to her as she stepped one foot over my body, I watch as she stripped herself of the dress she wore, exposing her perfect naked figure to me. ""Don't you worrys Tommy boy..."", she said as she lowered herself to straddle me, ""...Lavinia is going to make you feel all betters."" She rustled with my pants and suddenly I felt a wet like warmth at my groin. Was this sex? She rubbed herself on top of me back and forth, the terrifying pleasure of it had me closing my eyes, hoping this wasn't real. I opened them back up not the beautiful woman with a mole on her face, but to Elena! Her zombie formed appearance was worse than ever now. Skin was melting all over showing dry crusted bone, puss and blood ran from open cysts, her eyes had no pupils but were yellowed over, steaming like they were about to boil. She cackled and hooted as she kept violently rubbing against my torso. I could also hear the Lavinia woman's giggle from all around me like an echo. I found the strength to hurl her off and make my way out back into the rain. The horror of it all left me lost in streets once again. I finally found my way back to hotel. The experience has me completely sober and wide awake now. I'm not getting any sleep tonight.",1,1769002774.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

**PROLOGUE — The Incident**

I remember the day Shizuru Aoi transferred into our class.

She stood at the front of the room, hands clasped in front of her, smiling nervously. The teacher asked her to introduce herself.

She opened her mouth.

""M-my name is... Shi... Shizu...""

The words stuck. Her face turned red. Some kids looked away. Others whispered.

The teacher said, ""Take your time.""

She tried again. ""Shizuru Aoi. N-nice to meet you.""

Polite applause. She sat down two rows ahead of me. I didn't think much of it. Just another transfer student.

For a few weeks, everything seemed fine. Classmates were nice. A girl named Hana lent her notes. She ate lunch with a group of girls by the window. She smiled more each day. Laughed at jokes. Participated in gym class.

I remember thinking: She's fitting in okay.

Then came the presentation.

Literature class. Book reports. She stood at the front, reading from carefully written notes. Her handwriting was neat. Precise.

Halfway through, she stuttered badly.

""The ch-ch-character...""

She couldn't get past it. Her face flushed. The classroom went silent.

Then someone giggled. I don't know who.

She tried again. ""The ch—""

More giggles. Scattered. Nervous.

Her hands shook. The papers rustled. She pushed through somehow, finished shakily, and sat down.

The whispers started immediately.

After that, things changed.

Hana, the girl who lent her notes, started sitting on the other side of the room. At lunch, the group by the window stopped saving her a seat.

Shizuru began eating alone. Sometimes in the classroom. Sometimes she disappeared entirely.

I still didn't do anything. I just watched.

I told myself it wasn't my business.

---

Then one day, she dropped her notebook in the hallway between classes.

I picked it up. Her name was written on the cover in that same precise handwriting.

Kaito, my friend since elementary school, grinned. ""Bet it takes her ten minutes to say 'thank you.'""

I looked at her. She was staring at the floor, cheeks red, waiting.

I don't know why I did it.

Maybe I wanted Kaito to laugh. Maybe I wanted to feel included. Maybe I just didn't think.

I mimicked her. Quietly. ""Th-th-thanks.""

Kaito burst out laughing. Others in the hallway joined in.

Shizuru's eyes widened. She took the notebook quickly, walked away fast, shoulders hunched.

I felt something twist in my chest. Guilt, maybe. Shame.

But Kaito slapped my back. ""Dude, that was perfect.""

I smiled. Pushed it down.

After that, it got worse.

Kids mimicked her stutter in the halls. ""S-s-see you later."" ""C-c-can I borrow a pen?""

Someone wrote ""S-s-s-stutterer"" on her desk in permanent marker. She scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito started calling her ""Broken Record."" Others picked it up.

I didn't lead any of it. But I laughed. I participated.

I was there.

Shizuru stopped speaking in class entirely. Started writing all her answers on paper. The teacher allowed it, looking uncomfortable.

She ate lunch in the bathroom. I know because I saw her go in one day, carrying her lunch bag.

I told myself it wasn't my fault. Everyone was doing it. I was just going along.

---

Then came the group project.

The teacher assigned groups randomly. Shizuru ended up with me, Kaito, and another guy named Jun.

Kaito groaned loudly. ""Great, we're gonna fail because she can't even talk.""

The class laughed.

Jun looked uncomfortable but said nothing.

I wanted to say something. Tell Kaito to shut up. Defend her.

But I didn't.

Instead, trying to get another laugh, I said, ""Maybe we should just let her write her part on a sign.""

More laughter. Louder.

Shizuru's eyes filled with tears.

She grabbed her bag and ran out of the classroom.

The teacher called after her. ""Shizuru! Shizuru, wait!""

She didn't stop.

The laughter died. The teacher glared at us. At me specifically.

""Hibiki. Kaito. Principal's office. Now.""

We got detention. A lecture about bullying. They called our parents.

But Shizuru didn't come back to class that week.

---

The following Monday, the announcement came during homeroom.

""Shizuru Aoi has transferred to another school for personal reasons. We wish her well.""

Her desk sat empty. Someone had already cleaned off the marker.

Kaito shrugged. ""Whatever. She was weird anyway.""

I stared at the empty desk. The precise handwriting. The careful organization.

All gone.

---

A few days later, the homeroom teacher pulled me aside after class.

""Hibiki. We need to talk.""

My stomach dropped.

""The principal spoke with Shizuru's parents. They mentioned bullying. Harassment.""

I couldn't breathe.

""Your name came up. Multiple times.""

I tried to speak. ""It wasn't just me—""

""That doesn't make it better.""

Word spread fast.

By the end of the week, I was the problem.

Someone wrote ""Bully"" on my desk. I scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito and the others started sitting at a different table.

One day I approached them. Kaito looked up, loud enough for the cafeteria to hear: ""I always thought he was a jerk.""

Everyone at the table nodded.

I stood there, tray in hand, then walked away.

Found an empty table in the corner.

Someone whispered as I passed. ""He's the reason she left.""

I didn't argue. Didn't defend myself.

Because it was true.

---

For the next two years of middle school, I was invisible.

Ignored in group projects. Left out of conversations. Sometimes mocked.

""Hey, Hibiki, try not to make anyone else transfer, okay?""

I stopped trying to make friends. Stopped trying at all.

School. Home. Repeat.

Mom noticed. Of course she did.

""Hibiki, honey, is everything okay? You seem... distant.""

""I'm fine.""

""You can talk to me. About anything.""

""I know.""

But I didn't talk. I couldn't explain. Couldn't tell her what I'd done.

At night, I replayed it on loop.

Shizuru running out of the classroom. Her tears. Her shaking hands.

I thought: *I deserve this.*

---

Three years later, I still think that.

---

**ACT 1 — Present Day**

I wake up at 5 AM. Same nightmare. Same scene. Shizuru's face in the classroom.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for my heart to slow.

Then I get up. Get ready quietly.

Mom's asleep on the couch, still in her scrubs from the night shift. Dark circles under her eyes. Empty coffee cup on the table. She works too hard. Double shifts to make ends meet.

I leave breakfast money on the table with a note: *For lunch. -H*

I want to wake her. Tell her to go to bed. Make her tea.

But I don't know how to talk to her anymore. Every conversation feels like lying.

I leave for school.

---

School is the same routine. I sit alone at lunch. Do my homework in the library. Keep my head down in class.

Kaito tries to talk to me sometimes in the hallway.

""Dude, you're being weird. It's been three years.""

Three years. Like time erases what you did.

""We were kids. Let it go.""

I don't answer. Walk past him.

He calls after me. ""Whatever, man. Your loss.""

---

One afternoon, walking home through the shopping district, I see a flyer on a lamppost.

**Community Radio Station — Volunteers Needed**
**All ages welcome. No experience required.**
**Contact Mikae at...**

I recognize the address. Near the old bridge over the river. The bridge I used to cross every day to get to middle school.

I've avoided that area for three years.

That night, alone in my room, I search the station online.

Their website is simple. A schedule. A mission statement about community voices.

And a photo.

A girl wearing oversized headphones, sitting in a booth, smiling slightly at something off-camera.

Shizuru.

My hands shake. I close the laptop. Open it again. Stare at her face.

She looks... okay. Not happy, exactly. But okay. Peaceful, maybe.

I wonder if she thinks about me. If she hates me. If she's forgotten.

I apply before I can change my mind. Fill out the form. Hit submit.

Then I sit there, staring at the confirmation screen, wondering what the hell I'm doing.

Three days later, I get an email.

Interview scheduled. Saturday afternoon.

I almost don't go.

But I do.

---

The station is smaller than it looked online. A converted storefront wedged between a laundromat and a used bookstore.

Inside, it's cluttered. Equipment everywhere. CDs stacked haphazardly. Posters on the walls.

Mikae, the manager, is in her forties. Short gray hair. Kind eyes. No-nonsense voice.

She sits across from me in a tiny booth. ""So. Hibiki Tanabe. Why do you want to work here?""

I rehearsed this. ""I like music. I want to learn about radio.""

She studies me for a long moment. Doesn't smile.

""You know Shizuru Aoi volunteers here?""

My throat closes.

""Thought so."" She leans back in her chair. ""I'm not stupid, kid. And I don't appreciate liars.""

""I'm not—""

""You applied two days after we posted her photo on the website.""

Silence.

""Look,"" she says. ""I don't know what happened between you two. She hasn't told me, and I haven't asked. But if you're here to cause trouble, to apologize, to unload your guilt—""

""I'm not. I just... want to help.""

""Help who? Her or yourself?""

I don't have an answer.

She sighs. Pulls out a schedule. ""Then help. Don't talk to her unless she talks to you first. Don't apologize unless she asks. Don't make this about your feelings. Just. Work.""

She hands me the schedule.

I take it. Nod.

""And Hibiki?""

""Yeah?""

""If she asks you to leave, you leave. Understood?""

""Understood.""

---

My first day, I arrive early. Nervous. Sweating despite the cool morning.

Shizuru is already there.

She's organizing CDs alphabetically. Her movements careful, precise. The same way she wrote.

She sees me.

Her hand freezes mid-air. The CD case trembles slightly.

We stare at each other.

I want to say something. Apologize. Explain.

My mouth opens. Nothing comes out.

Long silence.

Then Mikae enters, carrying coffee. ""Morning. Hibiki, you're on equipment cleaning today. Brushes and cloths in the closet. Shizuru, you're prepping the evening broadcast.""

Shizuru nods. Sets the CD down carefully. Leaves the room without looking at me.

The door closes.

I exhale. Realize I'd been holding my breath.

Mikae hands me a brush. ""Get to work.""

---

**ACT 2 — Attempts and Rejections**

Two weeks in. The routine is familiar now. I clean equipment. Organize files. Learn the soundboard.

Shizuru and I exist in the same space but don't speak. Sometimes we're in the booth together. She edits audio. I check cables.

Silence. Always.

One evening, I come home later than usual.

Mom's awake. Sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. Still in her scrubs. Hair tied back, looking exhausted.

""Hibiki. You're working at a radio station?""

""Yeah.""

Her face lights up. ""That's wonderful! I didn't even know you were interested in that. Are you making friends?""

""It's just volunteer work.""

""Still. It's good to see you doing something. Getting out."" She smiles, hopeful. ""Maybe you'll make some friends there.""

I don't answer. Set my bag down.

Her smile fades slightly. ""Hibiki...""

""I'm tired, Mom.""

""I know. I just—"" She stops. Looks down at her tea. ""I worry about you.""

""I'm okay.""

""Are you?""

I don't know how to answer that. So I don't.

""Goodnight, Mom.""

""Goodnight.""

I go to my room. Lie in bed. Hate myself for shutting her out.

She deserves better. She works so hard. For me.

And I can't even talk to her.

---

Late at night, I write letters I'll never send.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm sorry for what I did. I know I hurt you. I think about it every day.*

Too simple. I cross it out.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I was a coward. I let them bully you. I participated. I don't expect forgiveness. I just want you to know I regret it.*

I crumple it. Regret. What does that even mean? What does it fix?

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm trying to be better. I don't know if it matters.*

I stare at it for a long time. Then fold it carefully and put it in the drawer with the others.

Seventeen letters now.

All unsent.

---

Across town, Shizuru sits at her desk, finishing homework.

Her father, Daichi, knocks softly on her door. ""Dinner's ready.""

She holds up one finger. *One minute.*

He lingers at the doorway. ""How was the station today?""

She nods. *Good.*

""That boy... Hibiki. He's there, right?""

Her pen stops moving.

""Has he bothered you? Talked to you?""

She shakes her head. Writes on her notepad: *He doesn't talk to me.*

""Good."" But he doesn't look relieved. His jaw tightens. ""If he does, if he says anything—""

She writes: *I'm okay, Dad.*

He wants to say more. She can see it. The fear in his eyes. The helplessness.

He blames himself. She knows. For not noticing sooner. For not protecting her.

""I just..."" He trails off. ""I don't want you to get hurt again.""

She writes: *I won't.*

He nods. Doesn't believe her. ""Dinner in five minutes.""

After he leaves, she stares at her reflection in the dark window.

Wonders if she'll ever stop seeing herself as broken.

Wonders if her father will ever stop seeing her that way too.

---

One afternoon, Kaito shows up at the station. Unannounced. Loud.

""Yo, Hibiki! Dude, this is where you've been hiding?""

He barges in, looking around. Sees the equipment. The posters.

Then he sees Shizuru through the glass booth. She's on air, reading the weather report. Her voice is quiet but steady.

""Oh shit. Is that—""

Mikae cuts in, sharp. ""Keep your voice down. We're live.""

Kaito lowers his voice, grinning at me. ""Wait. You're working with *her*? Dude, that's awkward as hell.""

My fists clench.

""Leave.""

""What? Come on, man. We were just kids. She's fine now, right? I mean, she's talking on the radio.""

""Get out.""

His grin fades. ""Seriously?""

""Yeah. Seriously.""

He stares at me. ""You've changed.""

""Yeah. I have.""

He shakes his head, muttering. ""Whatever, man. This is weird.""

He leaves.

The door slams.

Mikae watches me. Says nothing. Goes back to her work.

In the booth, Shizuru finishes the weather report. Her eyes flick to me for a second. Then away.

---

One evening, Shizuru and I are alone in the station. Mikae left early for a dentist appointment.

A pre-recorded segment is playing. Classical music. Quiet.

Then the equipment glitches. Static bursts through the speakers, harsh and sudden.

Shizuru flinches.

I move quickly. ""I can fix it.""

She hesitates. Steps back from the console.

I work in silence. Checking cables. Restarting the system.

She watches from the corner of the booth. I can feel her eyes on me. Cautious. Wary.

The static


clears. The music returns, smooth and uninterrupted.

I turn to face her. ""Shizuru, I—""

She walks out before I can finish.

The door closes softly behind her.

I stand there, screwdriver in hand, alone in the booth.

The pre-recorded segment plays on. A piano piece. Satie. *Gymnopédie No. 1*.

Slow. Melancholic. Beautiful.

I almost laugh. Almost cry.

Instead, I just stand there, listening.

---

A few days later, a call comes through on the request line. I'm filling in for Mikae during the late shift.

""Hello, you've reached Community Radio. Any requests?""

""Hey."" The voice is male, young, tired but friendly. ""Can you play something quiet? It's been a long day.""

""Sure. Any preference?""

""Dealer's choice. You sound like you'd pick something good.""

I flip through the CD collection. Pull out Coltrane. *Naima*.

""How's this?""

""Perfect. Thanks, man.""

I play it. The saxophone fills the small station. Gentle. Searching.

The caller stays on the line, silent, just listening.

After the song ends, he speaks again. ""That was exactly what I needed. You've got good taste.""

""Thanks.""

""I'm Toma, by the way.""

""Hibiki.""

""Cool. I'll call again sometime.""

He hangs up.

For a moment, I just sit there.

A stranger called. We talked about music. Nothing else.

For those few minutes, I wasn't the guy who ruined someone's life.

I was just a guy who played Coltrane.

It feels strange. Foreign. Like wearing someone else's clothes.

But I don't hate it.

---

The next week, Toma calls again. Asks for something upbeat this time. We talk for fifteen minutes about jazz, about Miles Davis versus Coltrane, about whether vinyl sounds better than digital.

Normal conversation. Easy.

I realize I haven't had a conversation like this in years.

---

One afternoon, Aya Fujimoto shows up at the station.

I'm outside, taking out the trash, when she appears. Arms crossed. Expression hard.

""You're Hibiki Tanabe.""

It's not a question.

""Yeah.""

""I'm Aya. Shizuru's friend.""

I nod. Wait.

""Stay away from her.""

""I work here.""

""Then quit.""

""I'm not trying to hurt her.""

Her eyes flash. ""You already did. Or did you forget?""

""I didn't forget.""

""Then why are you here?""

I don't have a good answer. Not one that doesn't sound selfish.

She steps closer. ""She doesn't owe you forgiveness. She doesn't owe you closure. She doesn't owe you anything.""

""I know.""

""Do you?"" She searches my face, looking for a lie. ""Because if you're here to make yourself feel better, to ease your guilt, you're using her all over again.""

That lands. Hard.

I look down. ""That's not—""

""Isn't it?"" She doesn't let me finish. ""You hurt her. She left. Now she's finally doing okay, and you show up. What do you think that does to her?""

""She was already here when I—""

""I don't care. She was fine before you came. Now she's tense all the time. Looking over her shoulder.""

Guilt twists in my stomach.

""I didn't mean—""

""You never mean to, do you?"" Her voice is cold. ""But you still do damage.""

She turns to leave, then stops.

""If you actually care about her, you'll leave. That's the only way to help.""

She walks away.

I stand there in the alley behind the station, trash bag in hand, her words echoing.

*You're using her all over again.*

Am I?

I don't know anymore.

---

That night, I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.

Aya's right.

I came here because Shizuru was here. I told myself it was to help. To atone.

But really, I just wanted to be near her. To see that she was okay. To ease my own guilt.

Selfish.

Always selfish.

I should quit.

But I don't.

---

**ACT 2.5 — The Forced Collaboration**

Two months into volunteering, it happens.

It's a Tuesday evening. Live broadcast. Shizuru's reading a poem on air. Her segment: ""Words Worth Hearing.""

She's halfway through when the microphone cuts out.

Dead silence on the broadcast.

Panic flashes across her face. She taps the mic. Nothing.

In the control room, Mikae swears. Checks the board. ""It's the cable. Hibiki, get in there. Now.""

I grab a replacement cable and rush into the booth.

Shizuru steps back, still holding the poem, hands trembling slightly.

I work fast. Unplug the dead cable. Swap it. Test the connection.

The mic crackles back to life.

""You're good,"" I whisper.

She takes a breath. Steps back to the mic.

Continues reading where she left off. Her voice doesn't shake.

*""And in the silence between words,*
*we find the space to breathe,*
*to heal,*
*to begin again.""*

She finishes the poem. Signs off gracefully.

The broadcast ends.

I'm still kneeling by the cable, unsure if I should leave.

She turns to me.

For a long moment, we just look at each other.

Then she nods. Once. Small.

I nod back.

She leaves the booth.

I stay there, cable in hand, heart pounding.

It's not forgiveness. Not even close.

But it's acknowledgment.

And for now, it's enough.

---

**ACT 3 — The Broadcast**

A month later, Mikae announces a special broadcast.

""Shizuru's doing a solo show. 'Voices That Matter.' She'll be reading listener stories about finding their voice.""

My stomach twists.

""When?""

""Friday. 8 PM.""

I nod.

---

Friday arrives.

The station is busier than usual. A few listeners show up in person to watch through the booth window.

Shizuru prepares quietly. Organizing her notes. Testing the mic.

Mikae pulls her aside. ""You sure you're ready?""

Shizuru writes on her notepad: *Yes.*

Mikae squeezes her shoulder. ""You've got this.""

---

8 PM.

Shizuru goes live.

""Good evening. This is Shizuru Aoi. Thank you for joining me tonight.""

Her voice is hesitant at first. Careful.

""Tonight, I want to share stories. From people like me. People who lost their voice. And found it again.""

She reads the first letter. From a woman who developed a stutter after a car accident. Who went years without speaking. Who found healing through poetry.

Then another. A man who went silent after losing his daughter. Who found his voice again through music.

Another. A teenager with social anxiety. Who started a podcast from their bedroom.

Story after story.

I listen from the control room, adjusting levels, making sure everything runs smoothly.

But mostly, I just listen.

Shizuru's voice grows steadier with each story. More confident.

She's not reading about herself. But in a way, she is.

Each story is a piece of her own.

Halfway through, I feel it. The urge.

To interrupt. To apologize. To tell her I'm sorry, that I see her now, that I understand.

I start to stand.

Mikae's hand lands on my shoulder. Firm.

""Don't.""

""I just—""

""You don't get to control her healing, Hibiki.""

I freeze.

""This isn't about you,"" she says quietly. ""It never was.""

I sit back down.

Listen.

Shizuru finishes the broadcast. Reads one final letter. From a middle school student who was bullied for stuttering. Who transferred schools. Who found a radio station that gave them a place to speak.

My breath catches.

""They wrote: 'I don't know if I'll ever forgive the people who hurt me. But I know I'm more than what they said I was. And that's enough.'""

Silence.

Then Shizuru speaks, her own words now.

""If you're listening tonight, and you've lost your voice—literally or otherwise—I want you to know: You don't have to be loud to matter. You don't have to be fearless. You just have to be willing. To try. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.""

She pauses.

""Thank you for listening. Goodnight.""

The broadcast ends.

Through the booth window, I see her. She's smiling. Small. Real.

People clap.

I realize: She doesn't need me to fix this.

She's already fixing herself.

---

**ACT 4 — The Bridge**

Three months pass.

I keep working at the station. Shizuru and I still don't talk much. But the tension eases. Slightly.

We exist in the same space without it feeling like a wound.

Progress, maybe.

One Saturday afternoon, I decide to walk home the long way.

Past the old bridge.

I haven't crossed it since middle school. Three years of avoidance.

But today, I do.

The river is loud. Rain from last night. The water rushes beneath, brown and turbulent.

Halfway across, I see her.

Shizuru.

Sitting on the railing, legs dangling, phone in hand. Recording the river.

My first instinct is to turn back.

But I don't.

I approach slowly. Stop a few steps away.

""I won't stay long.""

She looks at me. Nods.

Permission, maybe. Or just acknowledgment.

""I'm trying to be better,"" I say. ""You don't have to care.""

The river fills the silence.

She lowers her phone. Speaks. Slowly. Carefully.

""I know.""

Two words. But they land heavy.

""I'm sorry,"" I say. ""I know that's not enough.""

""It's not.""

I nod. Swallow hard.

Pause.

""But you're here.""

I look at her.

""You didn't run,"" she continues. ""You didn't make excuses. You just... stayed.""

My throat tightens.

""I don't forgive you.""

""I don't expect you to.""

""But I see you. Trying.""

The words hit me harder than any anger could.

""That's all I can give.""

""It's more than I deserve.""

She looks at the river. ""Maybe.""

I turn to leave.

""Hibiki.""

I stop.

""Don't come back here. To this bridge.""

I nod. Understand.

This place is hers. Her healing space.

I don't belong here.

""Okay.""

She lifts her phone again. Resumes recording.

The sound of water fills the space between us.

I walk away.

Don't look back.

---

**ACT 5 — Six Months Later**

Shizuru leads a workshop now. Every Thursday evening.

""Audio Storytelling for Beginners.""

She teaches others how to use recording equipment. How to edit. How to find their voice.

Literally and metaphorically.

I watch sometimes from the control room. She's confident now. Patient. Kind.

Explains things clearly. Encourages mistakes. Celebrates small victories.

One week, her father attends.

Daichi sits in the back, arms crossed at first. Skeptical. Protective.

But as the session continues, his posture softens.

He listens.

Really listens.

Shizuru talks about sound. About how recording gives you control. How you can replay your voice until it sounds right.

How sometimes, hearing yourself is the first step to believing in yourself.

After the session, Daichi approaches her.

He doesn't say anything.

Just hugs her.

Long. Tight.

She hugs him back.

When they pull apart, his eyes are wet.

""I'm proud of you,"" he whispers.

She nods. Smiles.

---

Toma visits the station in person for the first time.

He's younger than I expected. Early twenties. Messy hair. Bookstore employee lanyard around his neck.

""You're the guy with the good taste. Nice to finally meet you.""

We shake hands.

""Toma. Good to meet you too.""

We talk for an hour. About music. Books. He recommends a novel. I recommend an album.

Normal. Easy.

At one point, he says, ""You seem different than you sound on the phone.""

""Different how?""

""Lighter. On the phone, you always sound... I don't know. Weighted down. But in person, you smile more.""

I think about that.

""Maybe I am lighter,"" I say.

He grins. ""Good. Keep it up.""

---

One morning, Mom catches me before I leave for school.

""Hibiki. Wait.""

I stop.

She's still in her pajamas. Morning off, finally.

""You're smiling more,"" she says.

""Am I?""

""Yeah."" She looks hopeful. Careful. Like she's afraid to jinx it. ""The radio station... it's good for you.""

""Yeah. It is.""

She steps closer. Hugs me.

Quick. Tight.

""I'm proud of you. I don't know what changed, but... I'm proud.""

I hug her back.

""Thanks, Mom.""

She pulls away, wiping her eyes.

""Go. You'll be late.""

I leave, but I'm smiling.

---

One afternoon, outside the station, I see a kid struggling with broken headphones.

Maybe ten years old. Frustrated. Hitting them against his hand.

""Hey. Those broken?""

He looks up. ""Yeah. Only one side works.""

I pull out my own headphones. Hand them over.

""Here. Take these.""

He looks suspicious. ""These don't work right either.""

""One side's broken. But you only need one side to start listening.""

He takes them. Skeptical but grateful.

""Thanks, mister.""

He runs off.

I watch him go.

Think about broken things.

How sometimes they still work.

Just differently.

---

That evening, Shizuru is on air. Closing her weekly show.

I'm in the control room, adjusting levels, monitoring the feed.

Through the glass, we make eye contact.

No smile. No wave.

Just a small nod.

I nod back.

She returns to her broadcast.

I return to my work.

---

Later, walking home, I cross the bridge.

Not the one where I saw Shizuru. A different one.

The river is calm tonight. Reflecting streetlights.

I stop in the middle.

Think about distance.

How some distances never close.

How some damage never fully heals.

But how you can still move forward.

Still try.

Still listen.

---

The bridge didn't erase the distance between us.

It just made it safe to cross.

1qiy348,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1qiy348/rethinking_armor_durability_making_gear_matter/,Rethinking Armor Durability: Making Gear Matter Without Slowing Play,"This idea started the way most dangerous rules ideas do: mid-session, half a cup of cold coffee in, watching players do something clever that the rules technically allow… but fictionally feels off.

**Armor.**  
  
Specifically, armor that just *keeps working*.

In a game I’m running & writing, the characters are scraping by in heat, salt air, blood, rot, and bad decisions. Gear matters. Equipment is supposed to feel *temporary*. And yet armor, by virtue of being a static number, has this quiet immortality. You get it, you wear it, and unless the GM actively rips it away, it just… exists. Forever. Untouched by time, trauma, or the fact that you’ve been shoulder-checked by a Super-Z twice this session.

That’s the crack in the wall that got my brain spinning.

Because the *idea* of armor degrading? I love it. It fits the genre. It reinforces scarcity. It adds tension. It makes survival choices matter. It tells a story without box text.

But then the other half of my brain kicked in, the part that’s been burned before, and asked the real question:

**Is the squeeze worth the juice?**

Because we’ve all seen how this goes. Durability tracks. Armor HP. Thresholds. Condition states. “Make a note that your chest piece has 7 integrity left.” And suddenly the table feels like it’s doing taxes. The fiction slows down. The players forget to mark things. The GM forgets to enforce it. And a rule that *looked* elegant on paper turns into friction at the table.

So the problem isn’t *whether* armor should degrade. The problem is **how do you make it matter without making it annoying?**

That’s the line I’m walking, and this is where I really want to hear your thoughts.

What I don’t want is tracking damage over time. That’s a hard no. If a rule requires a pencil eraser more than imagination, it’s already losing me. Rotted Capes lives in the space where pressure comes from decisions, not bookkeeping.

So instead, I’ve been thinking about ***signals*** rather than ***stats.***

What if armor doesn’t slowly degrade, but instead fails at dramatically appropriate moments?

What if it’s not about “losing 1 point of protection,” but about crossing narrative fault lines?

One approach is tying armor damage to ***consequences***, not hits. A normal success? Armor holds. A mixed result, complication, or GM-triggered fallout? That’s when the armor takes the hit *for you*. It saves your skin… but it’s done. Bent plates. Torn straps. Cracked visor. Still wearable, but no longer trustworthy.

Another angle is scarcity without math. Armor doesn’t degrade numerically; it degrades ***fictionally*****.** The GM tells you it’s compromised. You know it. Everyone at the table knows it. From that moment on, it’s living on borrowed time. The next bad break, it’s gone. No tracking. Just tension.

You could even lean into ***player agency***. Let them choose. “You can ignore this injury, but your armor is wrecked,” or “You keep the armor intact, but take the hit.” Now armor isn’t just defense, it’s a resource players actively spend when things go sideways.

And of course, there’s the ***blunt option***: armor only protects you a finite number of times per session or per arc. No tracking damage. No numbers ticking down. Just a quiet understanding that protection isn’t infinite, and when it runs out, it *runs out loudly*.

The common thread in all of this is intent. The rule isn’t there to punish players or simulate metallurgy. It’s there to reinforce tone. To make the world feel harsh. To remind players that survival isn’t about stacking bonuses. It’s about choosing when to spend what little safety you have.

So yeah. I love the idea of armor getting wrecked. I just refuse to make it a chore.

That’s the design tension I keep circling back to: rules should create *pressure*, not paperwork. If a mechanic doesn’t speed up the story, sharpen decisions, or make the fiction hit harder, it doesn’t belong, no matter how realistic it looks on paper.

But I’m curious where you land.

Is armor durability worth it if it’s lightweight and narrative-driven? Or is this one of those ideas that sounds great in theory and dies at the table?

What’s the cleanest version of this rule you’ve seen, or would you even want it at all?",0,1769002635.0,rpg,7,0.45,False

**PROLOGUE — The Incident**

I remember the day Shizuru Aoi transferred into our class.

She stood at the front of the room, hands clasped in front of her, smiling nervously. The teacher asked her to introduce herself.

She opened her mouth.

""M-my name is... Shi... Shizu...""

The words stuck. Her face turned red. Some kids looked away. Others whispered.

The teacher said, ""Take your time.""

She tried again. ""Shizuru Aoi. N-nice to meet you.""

Polite applause. She sat down two rows ahead of me. I didn't think much of it. Just another transfer student.

For a few weeks, everything seemed fine. Classmates were nice. A girl named Hana lent her notes. She ate lunch with a group of girls by the window. She smiled more each day. Laughed at jokes. Participated in gym class.

I remember thinking: She's fitting in okay.

Then came the presentation.

Literature class. Book reports. She stood at the front, reading from carefully written notes. Her handwriting was neat. Precise.

Halfway through, she stuttered badly.

""The ch-ch-character...""

She couldn't get past it. Her face flushed. The classroom went silent.

Then someone giggled. I don't know who.

She tried again. ""The ch—""

More giggles. Scattered. Nervous.

Her hands shook. The papers rustled. She pushed through somehow, finished shakily, and sat down.

The whispers started immediately.

After that, things changed.

Hana, the girl who lent her notes, started sitting on the other side of the room. At lunch, the group by the window stopped saving her a seat.

Shizuru began eating alone. Sometimes in the classroom. Sometimes she disappeared entirely.

I still didn't do anything. I just watched.

I told myself it wasn't my business.

---

Then one day, she dropped her notebook in the hallway between classes.

I picked it up. Her name was written on the cover in that same precise handwriting.

Kaito, my friend since elementary school, grinned. ""Bet it takes her ten minutes to say 'thank you.'""

I looked at her. She was staring at the floor, cheeks red, waiting.

I don't know why I did it.

Maybe I wanted Kaito to laugh. Maybe I wanted to feel included. Maybe I just didn't think.

I mimicked her. Quietly. ""Th-th-thanks.""

Kaito burst out laughing. Others in the hallway joined in.

Shizuru's eyes widened. She took the notebook quickly, walked away fast, shoulders hunched.

I felt something twist in my chest. Guilt, maybe. Shame.

But Kaito slapped my back. ""Dude, that was perfect.""

I smiled. Pushed it down.

After that, it got worse.

Kids mimicked her stutter in the halls. ""S-s-see you later."" ""C-c-can I borrow a pen?""

Someone wrote ""S-s-s-stutterer"" on her desk in permanent marker. She scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito started calling her ""Broken Record."" Others picked it up.

I didn't lead any of it. But I laughed. I participated.

I was there.

Shizuru stopped speaking in class entirely. Started writing all her answers on paper. The teacher allowed it, looking uncomfortable.

She ate lunch in the bathroom. I know because I saw her go in one day, carrying her lunch bag.

I told myself it wasn't my fault. Everyone was doing it. I was just going along.

---

Then came the group project.

The teacher assigned groups randomly. Shizuru ended up with me, Kaito, and another guy named Jun.

Kaito groaned loudly. ""Great, we're gonna fail because she can't even talk.""

The class laughed.

Jun looked uncomfortable but said nothing.

I wanted to say something. Tell Kaito to shut up. Defend her.

But I didn't.

Instead, trying to get another laugh, I said, ""Maybe we should just let her write her part on a sign.""

More laughter. Louder.

Shizuru's eyes filled with tears.

She grabbed her bag and ran out of the classroom.

The teacher called after her. ""Shizuru! Shizuru, wait!""

She didn't stop.

The laughter died. The teacher glared at us. At me specifically.

""Hibiki. Kaito. Principal's office. Now.""

We got detention. A lecture about bullying. They called our parents.

But Shizuru didn't come back to class that week.

---

The following Monday, the announcement came during homeroom.

""Shizuru Aoi has transferred to another school for personal reasons. We wish her well.""

Her desk sat empty. Someone had already cleaned off the marker.

Kaito shrugged. ""Whatever. She was weird anyway.""

I stared at the empty desk. The precise handwriting. The careful organization.

All gone.

---

A few days later, the homeroom teacher pulled me aside after class.

""Hibiki. We need to talk.""

My stomach dropped.

""The principal spoke with Shizuru's parents. They mentioned bullying. Harassment.""

I couldn't breathe.

""Your name came up. Multiple times.""

I tried to speak. ""It wasn't just me—""

""That doesn't make it better.""

Word spread fast.

By the end of the week, I was the problem.

Someone wrote ""Bully"" on my desk. I scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito and the others started sitting at a different table.

One day I approached them. Kaito looked up, loud enough for the cafeteria to hear: ""I always thought he was a jerk.""

Everyone at the table nodded.

I stood there, tray in hand, then walked away.

Found an empty table in the corner.

Someone whispered as I passed. ""He's the reason she left.""

I didn't argue. Didn't defend myself.

Because it was true.

---

For the next two years of middle school, I was invisible.

Ignored in group projects. Left out of conversations. Sometimes mocked.

""Hey, Hibiki, try not to make anyone else transfer, okay?""

I stopped trying to make friends. Stopped trying at all.

School. Home. Repeat.

Mom noticed. Of course she did.

""Hibiki, honey, is everything okay? You seem... distant.""

""I'm fine.""

""You can talk to me. About anything.""

""I know.""

But I didn't talk. I couldn't explain. Couldn't tell her what I'd done.

At night, I replayed it on loop.

Shizuru running out of the classroom. Her tears. Her shaking hands.

I thought: *I deserve this.*

---

Three years later, I still think that.

---

**ACT 1 — Present Day**

I wake up at 5 AM. Same nightmare. Same scene. Shizuru's face in the classroom.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for my heart to slow.

Then I get up. Get ready quietly.

Mom's asleep on the couch, still in her scrubs from the night shift. Dark circles under her eyes. Empty coffee cup on the table. She works too hard. Double shifts to make ends meet.

I leave breakfast money on the table with a note: *For lunch. -H*

I want to wake her. Tell her to go to bed. Make her tea.

But I don't know how to talk to her anymore. Every conversation feels like lying.

I leave for school.

---

School is the same routine. I sit alone at lunch. Do my homework in the library. Keep my head down in class.

Kaito tries to talk to me sometimes in the hallway.

""Dude, you're being weird. It's been three years.""

Three years. Like time erases what you did.

""We were kids. Let it go.""

I don't answer. Walk past him.

He calls after me. ""Whatever, man. Your loss.""

---

One afternoon, walking home through the shopping district, I see a flyer on a lamppost.

**Community Radio Station — Volunteers Needed**
**All ages welcome. No experience required.**
**Contact Mikae at...**

I recognize the address. Near the old bridge over the river. The bridge I used to cross every day to get to middle school.

I've avoided that area for three years.

That night, alone in my room, I search the station online.

Their website is simple. A schedule. A mission statement about community voices.

And a photo.

A girl wearing oversized headphones, sitting in a booth, smiling slightly at something off-camera.

Shizuru.

My hands shake. I close the laptop. Open it again. Stare at her face.

She looks... okay. Not happy, exactly. But okay. Peaceful, maybe.

I wonder if she thinks about me. If she hates me. If she's forgotten.

I apply before I can change my mind. Fill out the form. Hit submit.

Then I sit there, staring at the confirmation screen, wondering what the hell I'm doing.

---

Three days later, I get an email.

Interview scheduled. Saturday afternoon.

I almost don't go.

But I do.

---

The station is smaller than it looked online. A converted storefront wedged between a laundromat and a used bookstore.

Inside, it's cluttered. Equipment everywhere. CDs stacked haphazardly. Posters on the walls.

Mikae, the manager, is in her forties. Short gray hair. Kind eyes. No-nonsense voice.

She sits across from me in a tiny booth. ""So. Hibiki Tanabe. Why do you want to work here?""

I rehearsed this. ""I like music. I want to learn about radio.""

She studies me for a long moment. Doesn't smile.

""You know Shizuru Aoi volunteers here?""

My throat closes.

""Thought so."" She leans back in her chair. ""I'm not stupid, kid. And I don't appreciate liars.""

""I'm not—""

""You applied two days after we posted her photo on the website.""

Silence.

""Look,"" she says. ""I don't know what happened between you two. She hasn't told me, and I haven't asked. But if you're here to cause trouble, to apologize, to unload your guilt—""

""I'm not. I just... want to help.""

""Help who? Her or yourself?""

I don't have an answer.

She sighs. Pulls out a schedule. ""Then help. Don't talk to her unless she talks to you first. Don't apologize unless she asks. Don't make this about your feelings. Just. Work.""

She hands me the schedule.

I take it. Nod.

""And Hibiki?""

""Yeah?""

""If she asks you to leave, you leave. Understood?""

""Understood.""

---

My first day, I arrive early. Nervous. Sweating despite the cool morning.

Shizuru is already there.

She's organizing CDs alphabetically. Her movements careful, precise. The same way she wrote.

She sees me.

Her hand freezes mid-air. The CD case trembles slightly.

We stare at each other.

I want to say something. Apologize. Explain.

My mouth opens. Nothing comes out.

Long silence.

Then Mikae enters, carrying coffee. ""Morning. Hibiki, you're on equipment cleaning today. Brushes and cloths in the closet. Shizuru, you're prepping the evening broadcast.""

Shizuru nods. Sets the CD down carefully. Leaves the room without looking at me.

The door closes.

I exhale. Realize I'd been holding my breath.

Mikae hands me a brush. ""Get to work.""

---

**ACT 2 — Attempts and Rejections**

Two weeks in. The routine is familiar now. I clean equipment. Organize files. Learn the soundboard.

Shizuru and I exist in the same space but don't speak. Sometimes we're in the booth together. She edits audio. I check cables.

Silence. Always.

One evening, I come home later than usual.

Mom's awake. Sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. Still in her scrubs. Hair tied back, looking exhausted.

""Hibiki. You're working at a radio station?""

""Yeah.""

Her face lights up. ""That's wonderful! I didn't even know you were interested in that. Are you making friends?""

""It's just volunteer work.""

""Still. It's good to see you doing something. Getting out."" She smiles, hopeful. ""Maybe you'll make some friends there.""

I don't answer. Set my bag down.

Her smile fades slightly. ""Hibiki...""

""I'm tired, Mom.""

""I know. I just—"" She stops. Looks down at her tea. ""I worry about you.""

""I'm okay.""

""Are you?""

I don't know how to answer that. So I don't.

""Goodnight, Mom.""

""Goodnight.""

I go to my room. Lie in bed. Hate myself for shutting her out.

She deserves better. She works so hard. For me.

And I can't even talk to her.

---

Late at night, I write letters I'll never send.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm sorry for what I did. I know I hurt you. I think about it every day.*

Too simple. I cross it out.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I was a coward. I let them bully you. I participated. I don't expect forgiveness. I just want you to know I regret it.*

I crumple it. Regret. What does that even mean? What does it fix?

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm trying to be better. I don't know if it matters.*

I stare at it for a long time. Then fold it carefully and put it in the drawer with the others.

Seventeen letters now.

All unsent.

---

Across town, Shizuru sits at her desk, finishing homework.

Her father, Daichi, knocks softly on her door. ""Dinner's ready.""

She holds up one finger. *One minute.*

He lingers at the doorway. ""How was the station today?""

She nods. *Good.*

""That boy... Hibiki. He's there, right?""

Her pen stops moving.

""Has he bothered you? Talked to you?""

She shakes her head. Writes on her notepad: *He doesn't talk to me.*

""Good."" But he doesn't look relieved. His jaw tightens. ""If he does, if he says anything—""

She writes: *I'm okay, Dad.*

He wants to say more. She can see it. The fear in his eyes. The helplessness.

He blames himself. She knows. For not noticing sooner. For not protecting her.

""I just..."" He trails off. ""I don't want you to get hurt again.""

She writes: *I won't.*

He nods. Doesn't believe her. ""Dinner in five minutes.""

After he leaves, she stares at her reflection in the dark window.

Wonders if she'll ever stop seeing herself as broken.

Wonders if her father will ever stop seeing her that way too.

---

One afternoon, Kaito shows up at the station. Unannounced. Loud.

""Yo, Hibiki! Dude, this is where you've been hiding?""

He barges in, looking around. Sees the equipment. The posters.

Then he sees Shizuru through the glass booth. She's on air, reading the weather report. Her voice is quiet but steady.

""Oh shit. Is that—""

Mikae cuts in, sharp. ""Keep your voice down. We're live.""

Kaito lowers his voice, grinning at me. ""Wait. You're working with *her*? Dude, that's awkward as hell.""

My fists clench.

""Leave.""

""What? Come on, man. We were just kids. She's fine now, right? I mean, she's talking on the radio.""

""Get out.""

His grin fades. ""Seriously?""

""Yeah. Seriously.""

He stares at me. ""You've changed.""

""Yeah. I have.""

He shakes his head, muttering. ""Whatever, man. This is weird.""

He leaves.

The door slams.

Mikae watches me. Says nothing. Goes back to her work.

In the booth, Shizuru finishes the weather report. Her eyes flick to me for a second. Then away.

---

One evening, Shizuru and I are alone in the station. Mikae left early for a dentist appointment.

A pre-recorded segment is playing. Classical music. Quiet.

Then the equipment glitches. Static bursts through the speakers, harsh and sudden.

Shizuru flinches.

I move quickly. ""I can fix it.""

She hesitates. Steps back from the console.

I work in silence. Checking cables. Restarting the system.

She watches from the corner of the booth. I can feel her eyes on me. Cautious. Wary.

The static


clears. The music returns, smooth and uninterrupted.

I turn to face her. ""Shizuru, I—""

She walks out before I can finish.

The door closes softly behind her.

I stand there, screwdriver in hand, alone in the booth.

The pre-recorded segment plays on. A piano piece. Satie. *Gymnopédie No. 1*.

Slow. Melancholic. Beautiful.

I almost laugh. Almost cry.

Instead, I just stand there, listening.

---

A few days later, a call comes through on the request line. I'm filling in for Mikae during the late shift.

""Hello, you've reached Community Radio. Any requests?""

""Hey."" The voice is male, young, tired but friendly. ""Can you play something quiet? It's been a long day.""

""Sure. Any preference?""

""Dealer's choice. You sound like you'd pick something good.""

I flip through the CD collection. Pull out Coltrane. *Naima*.

""How's this?""

""Perfect. Thanks, man.""

I play it. The saxophone fills the small station. Gentle. Searching.

The caller stays on the line, silent, just listening.

After the song ends, he speaks again. ""That was exactly what I needed. You've got good taste.""

""Thanks.""

""I'm Toma, by the way.""

""Hibiki.""

""Cool. I'll call again sometime.""

He hangs up.

For a moment, I just sit there.

A stranger called. We talked about music. Nothing else.

For those few minutes, I wasn't the guy who ruined someone's life.

I was just a guy who played Coltrane.

It feels strange. Foreign. Like wearing someone else's clothes.

But I don't hate it.

---

The next week, Toma calls again. Asks for something upbeat this time. We talk for fifteen minutes about jazz, about Miles Davis versus Coltrane, about whether vinyl sounds better than digital.

Normal conversation. Easy.

I realize I haven't had a conversation like this in years.

---

One afternoon, Aya Fujimoto shows up at the station.

I'm outside, taking out the trash, when she appears. Arms crossed. Expression hard.

""You're Hibiki Tanabe.""

It's not a question.

""Yeah.""

""I'm Aya. Shizuru's friend.""

I nod. Wait.

""Stay away from her.""

""I work here.""

""Then quit.""

""I'm not trying to hurt her.""

Her eyes flash. ""You already did. Or did you forget?""

""I didn't forget.""

""Then why are you here?""

I don't have a good answer. Not one that doesn't sound selfish.

She steps closer. ""She doesn't owe you forgiveness. She doesn't owe you closure. She doesn't owe you anything.""

""I know.""

""Do you?"" She searches my face, looking for a lie. ""Because if you're here to make yourself feel better, to ease your guilt, you're using her all over again.""

That lands. Hard.

I look down. ""That's not—""

""Isn't it?"" She doesn't let me finish. ""You hurt her. She left. Now she's finally doing okay, and you show up. What do you think that does to her?""

""She was already here when I—""

""I don't care. She was fine before you came. Now she's tense all the time. Looking over her shoulder.""

Guilt twists in my stomach.

""I didn't mean—""

""You never mean to, do you?"" Her voice is cold. ""But you still do damage.""

She turns to leave, then stops.

""If you actually care about her, you'll leave. That's the only way to help.""

She walks away.

I stand there in the alley behind the station, trash bag in hand, her words echoing.

*You're using her all over again.*

Am I?

I don't know anymore.

---

That night, I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.

Aya's right.

I came here because Shizuru was here. I told myself it was to help. To atone.

But really, I just wanted to be near her. To see that she was okay. To ease my own guilt.

Selfish.

Always selfish.

I should quit.

But I don't.

---

**ACT 2.5 — The Forced Collaboration**

Two months into volunteering, it happens.

It's a Tuesday evening. Live broadcast. Shizuru's reading a poem on air. Her segment: ""Words Worth Hearing.""

She's halfway through when the microphone cuts out.

Dead silence on the broadcast.

Panic flashes across her face. She taps the mic. Nothing.

In the control room, Mikae swears. Checks the board. ""It's the cable. Hibiki, get in there. Now.""

I grab a replacement cable and rush into the booth.

Shizuru steps back, still holding the poem, hands trembling slightly.

I work fast. Unplug the dead cable. Swap it. Test the connection.

The mic crackles back to life.

""You're good,"" I whisper.

She takes a breath. Steps back to the mic.

Continues reading where she left off. Her voice doesn't shake.

*""And in the silence between words,*
*we find the space to breathe,*
*to heal,*
*to begin again.""*

She finishes the poem. Signs off gracefully.

The broadcast ends.

I'm still kneeling by the cable, unsure if I should leave.

She turns to me.

For a long moment, we just look at each other.

Then she nods. Once. Small.

I nod back.

She leaves the booth.

I stay there, cable in hand, heart pounding.

It's not forgiveness. Not even close.

But it's acknowledgment.

And for now, it's enough.

---

**ACT 3 — The Broadcast**

A month later, Mikae announces a special broadcast.

""Shizuru's doing a solo show. 'Voices That Matter.' She'll be reading listener stories about finding their voice.""

My stomach twists.

""When?""

""Friday. 8 PM.""

I nod.

---

Friday arrives.

The station is busier than usual. A few listeners show up in person to watch through the booth window.

Shizuru prepares quietly. Organizing her notes. Testing the mic.

Mikae pulls her aside. ""You sure you're ready?""

Shizuru writes on her notepad: *Yes.*

Mikae squeezes her shoulder. ""You've got this.""

---

8 PM.

Shizuru goes live.

""Good evening. This is Shizuru Aoi. Thank you for joining me tonight.""

Her voice is hesitant at first. Careful.

""Tonight, I want to share stories. From people like me. People who lost their voice. And found it again.""

She reads the first letter. From a woman who developed a stutter after a car accident. Who went years without speaking. Who found healing through poetry.

Then another. A man who went silent after losing his daughter. Who found his voice again through music.

Another. A teenager with social anxiety. Who started a podcast from their bedroom.

Story after story.

I listen from the control room, adjusting levels, making sure everything runs smoothly.

But mostly, I just listen.

Shizuru's voice grows steadier with each story. More confident.

She's not reading about herself. But in a way, she is.

Each story is a piece of her own.

Halfway through, I feel it. The urge.

To interrupt. To apologize. To tell her I'm sorry, that I see her now, that I understand.

I start to stand.

Mikae's hand lands on my shoulder. Firm.

""Don't.""

""I just—""

""You don't get to control her healing, Hibiki.""

I freeze.

""This isn't about you,"" she says quietly. ""It never was.""

I sit back down.

Listen.

Shizuru finishes the broadcast. Reads one final letter. From a middle school student who was bullied for stuttering. Who transferred schools. Who found a radio station that gave them a place to speak.

My breath catches.

""They wrote: 'I don't know if I'll ever forgive the people who hurt me. But I know I'm more than what they said I was. And that's enough.'""

Silence.

Then Shizuru speaks, her own words now.

""If you're listening tonight, and you've lost your voice—literally or otherwise—I want you to know: You don't have to be loud to matter. You don't have to be fearless. You just have to be willing. To try. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.""

She pauses.

""Thank you for listening. Goodnight.""

The broadcast ends.

Through the booth window, I see her. She's smiling. Small. Real.

People clap.

I realize: She doesn't need me to fix this.

She's already fixing herself.

---

**ACT 4 — The Bridge**

Three months pass.

I keep working at the station. Shizuru and I still don't talk much. But the tension eases. Slightly.

We exist in the same space without it feeling like a wound.

Progress, maybe.

One Saturday afternoon, I decide to walk home the long way.

Past the old bridge.

I haven't crossed it since middle school. Three years of avoidance.

But today, I do.

The river is loud. Rain from last night. The water rushes beneath, brown and turbulent.

Halfway across, I see her.

Shizuru.

Sitting on the railing, legs dangling, phone in hand. Recording the river.

My first instinct is to turn back.

But I don't.

I approach slowly. Stop a few steps away.

""I won't stay long.""

She looks at me. Nods.

Permission, maybe. Or just acknowledgment.

""I'm trying to be better,"" I say. ""You don't have to care.""

The river fills the silence.

She lowers her phone. Speaks. Slowly. Carefully.

""I know.""

Two words. But they land heavy.

""I'm sorry,"" I say. ""I know that's not enough.""

""It's not.""

I nod. Swallow hard.

Pause.

""But you're here.""

I look at her.

""You didn't run,"" she continues. ""You didn't make excuses. You just... stayed.""

My throat tightens.

""I don't forgive you.""

""I don't expect you to.""

""But I see you. Trying.""

The words hit me harder than any anger could.

""That's all I can give.""

""It's more than I deserve.""

She looks at the river. ""Maybe.""

I turn to leave.

""Hibiki.""

I stop.

""Don't come back here. To this bridge.""

I nod. Understand.

This place is hers. Her healing space.

I don't belong here.

""Okay.""

She lifts her phone again. Resumes recording.

The sound of water fills the space between us.

I walk away.

Don't look back.

---

**ACT 5 — Six Months Later**

Shizuru leads a workshop now. Every Thursday evening.

""Audio Storytelling for Beginners.""

She teaches others how to use recording equipment. How to edit. How to find their voice.

Literally and metaphorically.

I watch sometimes from the control room. She's confident now. Patient. Kind.

Explains things clearly. Encourages mistakes. Celebrates small victories.

One week, her father attends.

Daichi sits in the back, arms crossed at first. Skeptical. Protective.

But as the session continues, his posture softens.

He listens.

Really listens.

Shizuru talks about sound. About how recording gives you control. How you can replay your voice until it sounds right.

How sometimes, hearing yourself is the first step to believing in yourself.

After the session, Daichi approaches her.

He doesn't say anything.

Just hugs her.

Long. Tight.

She hugs him back.

When they pull apart, his eyes are wet.

""I'm proud of you,"" he whispers.

She nods. Smiles.

---

Toma visits the station in person for the first time.

He's younger than I expected. Early twenties. Messy hair. Bookstore employee lanyard around his neck.

""You're the guy with the good taste. Nice to finally meet you.""

We shake hands.

""Toma. Good to meet you too.""

We talk for an hour. About music. Books. He recommends a novel. I recommend an album.

Normal. Easy.

At one point, he says, ""You seem different than you sound on the phone.""

""Different how?""

""Lighter. On the phone, you always sound... I don't know. Weighted down. But in person, you smile more.""

I think about that.

""Maybe I am lighter,"" I say.

He grins. ""Good. Keep it up.""

---

One morning, Mom catches me before I leave for school.

""Hibiki. Wait.""

I stop.

She's still in her pajamas. Morning off, finally.

""You're smiling more,"" she says.

""Am I?""

""Yeah."" She looks hopeful. Careful. Like she's afraid to jinx it. ""The radio station... it's good for you.""

""Yeah. It is.""

She steps closer. Hugs me.

Quick. Tight.

""I'm proud of you. I don't know what changed, but... I'm proud.""

I hug her back.

""Thanks, Mom.""

She pulls away, wiping her eyes.

""Go. You'll be late.""

I leave, but I'm smiling.

---

One afternoon, outside the station, I see a kid struggling with broken headphones.

Maybe ten years old. Frustrated. Hitting them against his hand.

""Hey. Those broken?""

He looks up. ""Yeah. Only one side works.""

I pull out my own headphones. Hand them over.

""Here. Take these.""

He looks suspicious. ""These don't work right either.""

""One side's broken. But you only need one side to start listening.""

He takes them. Skeptical but grateful.

""Thanks, mister.""

He runs off.

I watch him go.

Think about broken things.

How sometimes they still work.

Just differently.

---

That evening, Shizuru is on air. Closing her weekly show.

I'm in the control room, adjusting levels, monitoring the feed.

Through the glass, we make eye contact.

No smile. No wave.

Just a small nod.

I nod back.

She returns to her broadcast.

I return to my work.

---

Later, walking home, I cross the bridge.

Not the one where I saw Shizuru. A different one.

The river is calm tonight. Reflecting streetlights.

I stop in the middle.

Think about distance.

How some distances never close.

How some damage never fully heals.

But how you can still move forward.

Still try.

Still listen.

---

The bridge didn't erase the distance between us.

It just made it safe to cross.

1qiy1qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1qiy1qd/my_diary_entry_on_hating_being_a_man_lately/,My diary entry on hating being a man lately,"I am drinking cola while listening to Lana Del Rey. I don't know her and probably wouldn't agree totally with her on some things because of her controversies BUT we feel the same pain. On the way from dermatologist I thought of Virginia Woolf's diary. I love diaries. Now on this site I got love from but also saw so much hate, Reddit, someone said how they're just giving up on making friends (since its according to te post hard to do in Germany since Germans are private people according to them) and they're focusing on themselves and talking with themselves thru diary. Thats a god point and I love that being an artist eventho a curse currently makes suffering a inspiration to wirte and especially books. 

What am I insane about? I want to let it out. I hate being a man, we are so cruel, so limited, so primal. I mean the whole world is like that but at least women have their freedom, they stand for freedom, diversity, sensibilisity and beauty in the world. They don't like us either actually. Even straight women are into other women - ""women are just more beautiful, sensual, ellegant"". So we men are disgusting beings - we are rapists, murderers, the ones with closed mindset, just roughness and hate - women hate us and we hate other men. Women stand for freedom, art, empathy, creation, care for humans, animals, planet, beauty, sensuality, fluidity,  - all things I find beautiful and which actually matter and make sence out of this existance. If I do these things do you think I can really be celebrated? I mean yeah women in my life loved me and some boys too but... I have a feeling in mainstream narrative, these beautiful things can not belong to me because I am a man. I always found my bisexuality (eventho I am leaning towards women in relationships) to be something great until I got on Reddit. This Reddit. Social media fucked me up. Something that gave a 11yo me a platform tro meet the world now destroys my world and the world in general because of this dumb polarisation and dumbification of people as we werent dumb enough. I hate the left and the right for this. Heidi Reinichek (germaqn leftist politician) saying how ""the problem are men"" and there comes the neo-nazi bullshit from AfD taking those hurt men but only under the condition that they turn into those toxic men. Being masculine basically means being an emotionless ruthless all-capable killer robot. Me standing for those beautfiul things that  mentioned makes me feminine and feminine is bad and pathetic, but at least a woman can be feminine a man can't. I love that we have broaden femininity, oh my you can be a woman in sooo many ways and this is beautfiul, but a man? Masculinity is more fragile that a wine glass. Everything you do as a man is gay. I have a feeling I can't have a personality without getting those accusations. This is sad. And women when they're struggling at least have a whole community to support them. As I was on a site of my University's Counceling support they had an extra ""women therapy"" but no extra ""men's therapy"" eventho men are 3/4 of all suicides. Why can't we be equal? I willnot give up on my self I promised myself that I will give myself a chance to live this year after everything I fought the last years but if it doesn't get better after EVERYTHING I am trying, I am going to end myself in 2027.

Ofc it isn't all black and white eventho my anxiety makes me think that, there is a ""Men therapy"" by Caritas and ofc we talk about men issues but not in the way I would like it to be. Let's see what happens, I will just chill in this era of me, enjoy sensations like my morning coffee, organic food I bought for cheap, some experimental music maybe and ofc some books and games omg I love games they are saving me, the only thing that never bothers me.",3,1769002530.0,MensRights,1,0.8,False

**PROLOGUE — The Incident**  

I remember the day Shizuru Aoi transferred into our class.

She stood at the front of the room, hands clasped in front of her, smiling nervously. The teacher asked her to introduce herself.

She opened her mouth.

""M-my name is... Shi... Shizu...""

The words stuck. Her face turned red. Some kids looked away. Others whispered.

The teacher said, ""Take your time.""

She tried again. ""Shizuru Aoi. N-nice to meet you.""

Polite applause. She sat down two rows ahead of me. I didn't think much of it. Just another transfer student.

For a few weeks, everything seemed fine. Classmates were nice. A girl named Hana lent her notes. She ate lunch with a group of girls by the window. She smiled more each day. Laughed at jokes. Participated in gym class.

I remember thinking: She's fitting in okay.

Then came the presentation.

Literature class. Book reports. She stood at the front, reading from carefully written notes. Her handwriting was neat. Precise.

Halfway through, she stuttered badly.

""The ch-ch-character...""

She couldn't get past it. Her face flushed. The classroom went silent.

Then someone giggled. I don't know who.

She tried again. ""The ch—""

More giggles. Scattered. Nervous.

Her hands shook. The papers rustled. She pushed through somehow, finished shakily, and sat down.

The whispers started immediately.

After that, things changed.

Hana, the girl who lent her notes, started sitting on the other side of the room. At lunch, the group by the window stopped saving her a seat.

Shizuru began eating alone. Sometimes in the classroom. Sometimes she disappeared entirely.

I still didn't do anything. I just watched.

I told myself it wasn't my business.

Then one day, she dropped her notebook in the hallway between classes.

I picked it up. Her name was written on the cover in that same precise handwriting.

Kaito, my friend since elementary school, grinned. ""Bet it takes her ten minutes to say 'thank you.'""

I looked at her. She was staring at the floor, cheeks red, waiting.

I don't know why I did it.

Maybe I wanted Kaito to laugh. Maybe I wanted to feel included. Maybe I just didn't think.

I mimicked her. Quietly. ""Th-th-thanks.""

Kaito burst out laughing. Others in the hallway joined in.

Shizuru's eyes widened. She took the notebook quickly, walked away fast, shoulders hunched.

I felt something twist in my chest. Guilt, maybe. Shame.

But Kaito slapped my back. ""Dude, that was perfect.""

I smiled. Pushed it down.

After that, it got worse.

Kids mimicked her stutter in the halls. ""S-s-see you later."" ""C-c-can I borrow a pen?""

Someone wrote ""S-s-s-stutterer"" on her desk in permanent marker. She scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito started calling her ""Broken Record."" Others picked it up.

I didn't lead any of it. But I laughed. I participated.

I was there.

Shizuru stopped speaking in class entirely. Started writing all her answers on paper. The teacher allowed it, looking uncomfortable.

She ate lunch in the bathroom. I know because I saw her go in one day, carrying her lunch bag.

I told myself it wasn't my fault. Everyone was doing it. I was just going along.

Then came the group project.

The teacher assigned groups randomly. Shizuru ended up with me, Kaito, and another guy named Jun.

Kaito groaned loudly. ""Great, we're gonna fail because she can't even talk.""

The class laughed.

Jun looked uncomfortable but said nothing.

I wanted to say something. Tell Kaito to shut up. Defend her.

But I didn't.

Instead, trying to get another laugh, I said, ""Maybe we should just let her write her part on a sign.""

More laughter. Louder.

Shizuru's eyes filled with tears.

She grabbed her bag and ran out of the classroom.

The teacher called after her. ""Shizuru! Shizuru, wait!""

She didn't stop.

The laughter died. The teacher glared at us. At me specifically.

""Hibiki. Kaito. Principal's office. Now.""

We got detention. A lecture about bullying. They called our parents.

But Shizuru didn't come back to class that week.

The following Monday, the announcement came during homeroom.

""Shizuru Aoi has transferred to another school for personal reasons. We wish her well.""

Her desk sat empty. Someone had already cleaned off the marker.

Kaito shrugged. ""Whatever. She was weird anyway.""

I stared at the empty desk. The precise handwriting. The careful organization.

All gone.

A few days later, the homeroom teacher pulled me aside after class.

""Hibiki. We need to talk.""

My stomach dropped.

""The principal spoke with Shizuru's parents. They mentioned bullying. Harassment.""

I couldn't breathe.

""Your name came up. Multiple times.""

I tried to speak. ""It wasn't just me—""

""That doesn't make it better.""

Word spread fast.

By the end of the week, I was the problem.

Someone wrote ""Bully"" on my desk. I scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito and the others started sitting at a different table.

One day I approached them. Kaito looked up, loud enough for the cafeteria to hear: ""I always thought he was a jerk.""

Everyone at the table nodded.

I stood there, tray in hand, then walked away.

Found an empty table in the corner.

Someone whispered as I passed. ""He's the reason she left.""

I didn't argue. Didn't defend myself.

Because it was true.

For the next two years of middle school, I was invisible.

Ignored in group projects. Left out of conversations. Sometimes mocked.

""Hey, Hibiki, try not to make anyone else transfer, okay?""

I stopped trying to make friends. Stopped trying at all.

School. Home. Repeat.

Mom noticed. Of course she did.

""Hibiki, honey, is everything okay? You seem... distant.""

""I'm fine.""

""You can talk to me. About anything.""

""I know.""

But I didn't talk. I couldn't explain. Couldn't tell her what I'd done.

At night, I replayed it on loop.

Shizuru running out of the classroom. Her tears. Her shaking hands.

I thought: *I deserve this.*

---

Three years later, I still think that.

---

**ACT 1 — Present Day**

I wake up at 5 AM. Same nightmare. Same scene. Shizuru's face in the classroom.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for my heart to slow.

Then I get up. Get ready quietly.

Mom's asleep on the couch, still in her scrubs from the night shift. Dark circles under her eyes. Empty coffee cup on the table. She works too hard. Double shifts to make ends meet.

I leave breakfast money on the table with a note: *For lunch. -H*

I want to wake her. Tell her to go to bed. Make her tea.

But I don't know how to talk to her anymore. Every conversation feels like lying.

I leave for school.

---

School is the same routine. I sit alone at lunch. Do my homework in the library. Keep my head down in class.

Kaito tries to talk to me sometimes in the hallway.

""Dude, you're being weird. It's been three years.""

Three years. Like time erases what you did.

""We were kids. Let it go.""

I don't answer. Walk past him.

He calls after me. ""Whatever, man. Your loss.""

---

One afternoon, walking home through the shopping district, I see a flyer on a lamppost.

**Community Radio Station — Volunteers Needed**
**All ages welcome. No experience required.**
**Contact Mikae at...**

I recognize the address. Near the old bridge over the river. The bridge I used to cross every day to get to middle school.

I've avoided that area for three years.

That night, alone in my room, I search the station online.

Their website is simple. A schedule. A mission statement about community voices.

And a photo.

A girl wearing oversized headphones, sitting in a booth, smiling slightly at something off-camera.

Shizuru.

My hands shake. I close the laptop. Open it again. Stare at her face.

She looks... okay. Not happy, exactly. But okay. Peaceful, maybe.

I wonder if she thinks about me. If she hates me. If she's forgotten.

I apply before I can change my mind. Fill out the form. Hit submit.

Then I sit there, staring at the confirmation screen, wondering what the hell I'm doing.

---

Three days later, I get an email.

Interview scheduled. Saturday afternoon.

I almost don't go.

But I do.

---

The station is smaller than it looked online. A converted storefront wedged between a laundromat and a used bookstore.

Inside, it's cluttered. Equipment everywhere. CDs stacked haphazardly. Posters on the walls.

Mikae, the manager, is in her forties. Short gray hair. Kind eyes. No-nonsense voice.

She sits across from me in a tiny booth. ""So. Hibiki Tanabe. Why do you want to work here?""

I rehearsed this. ""I like music. I want to learn about radio.""

She studies me for a long moment. Doesn't smile.

""You know Shizuru Aoi volunteers here?""

My throat closes.

""Thought so."" She leans back in her chair. ""I'm not stupid, kid. And I don't appreciate liars.""

""I'm not—""

""You applied two days after we posted her photo on the website.""

Silence.

""Look,"" she says. ""I don't know what happened between you two. She hasn't told me, and I haven't asked. But if you're here to cause trouble, to apologize, to unload your guilt—""

""I'm not. I just... want to help.""

""Help who? Her or yourself?""

I don't have an answer.

She sighs. Pulls out a schedule. ""Then help. Don't talk to her unless she talks to you first. Don't apologize unless she asks. Don't make this about your feelings. Just. Work.""

She hands me the schedule.

I take it. Nod.

""And Hibiki?""

""Yeah?""

""If she asks you to leave, you leave. Understood?""

""Understood.""

---

My first day, I arrive early. Nervous. Sweating despite the cool morning.

Shizuru is already there.

She's organizing CDs alphabetically. Her movements careful, precise. The same way she wrote.

She sees me.

Her hand freezes mid-air. The CD case trembles slightly.

We stare at each other.

I want to say something. Apologize. Explain.

My mouth opens. Nothing comes out.

Long silence.

Then Mikae enters, carrying coffee. ""Morning. Hibiki, you're on equipment cleaning today. Brushes and cloths in the closet. Shizuru, you're prepping the evening broadcast.""

Shizuru nods. Sets the CD down carefully. Leaves the room without looking at me.

The door closes.

I exhale. Realize I'd been holding my breath.

Mikae hands me a brush. ""Get to work.""

---

**ACT 2 — Attempts and Rejections**

Two weeks in. The routine is familiar now. I clean equipment. Organize files. Learn the soundboard.

Shizuru and I exist in the same space but don't speak. Sometimes we're in the booth together. She edits audio. I check cables.

Silence. Always.

One evening, I come home later than usual.

Mom's awake. Sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. Still in her scrubs. Hair tied back, looking exhausted.

""Hibiki. You're working at a radio station?""

""Yeah.""

Her face lights up. ""That's wonderful! I didn't even know you were interested in that. Are you making friends?""

""It's just volunteer work.""

""Still. It's good to see you doing something. Getting out."" She smiles, hopeful. ""Maybe you'll make some friends there.""

I don't answer. Set my bag down.

Her smile fades slightly. ""Hibiki...""

""I'm tired, Mom.""

""I know. I just—"" She stops. Looks down at her tea. ""I worry about you.""

""I'm okay.""

""Are you?""

I don't know how to answer that. So I don't.

""Goodnight, Mom.""

""Goodnight.""

I go to my room. Lie in bed. Hate myself for shutting her out.

She deserves better. She works so hard. For me.

And I can't even talk to her.

---

Late at night, I write letters I'll never send.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm sorry for what I did. I know I hurt you. I think about it every day.*

Too simple. I cross it out.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I was a coward. I let them bully you. I participated. I don't expect forgiveness. I just want you to know I regret it.*

I crumple it. Regret. What does that even mean? What does it fix?

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm trying to be better. I don't know if it matters.*

I stare at it for a long time. Then fold it carefully and put it in the drawer with the others.

Seventeen letters now.

All unsent.

---

Across town, Shizuru sits at her desk, finishing homework.

Her father, Daichi, knocks softly on her door. ""Dinner's ready.""

She holds up one finger. *One minute.*

He lingers at the doorway. ""How was the station today?""

She nods. *Good.*

""That boy... Hibiki. He's there, right?""

Her pen stops moving.

""Has he bothered you? Talked to you?""

She shakes her head. Writes on her notepad: *He doesn't talk to me.*

""Good."" But he doesn't look relieved. His jaw tightens. ""If he does, if he says anything—""

She writes: *I'm okay, Dad.*

He wants to say more. She can see it. The fear in his eyes. The helplessness.

He blames himself. She knows. For not noticing sooner. For not protecting her.

""I just..."" He trails off. ""I don't want you to get hurt again.""

She writes: *I won't.*

He nods. Doesn't believe her. ""Dinner in five minutes.""

After he leaves, she stares at her reflection in the dark window.

Wonders if she'll ever stop seeing herself as broken.

Wonders if her father will ever stop seeing her that way too.

---

One afternoon, Kaito shows up at the station. Unannounced. Loud.

""Yo, Hibiki! Dude, this is where you've been hiding?""

He barges in, looking around. Sees the equipment. The posters.

Then he sees Shizuru through the glass booth. She's on air, reading the weather report. Her voice is quiet but steady.

""Oh shit. Is that—""

Mikae cuts in, sharp. ""Keep your voice down. We're live.""

Kaito lowers his voice, grinning at me. ""Wait. You're working with *her*? Dude, that's awkward as hell.""

My fists clench.

""Leave.""

""What? Come on, man. We were just kids. She's fine now, right? I mean, she's talking on the radio.""

""Get out.""

His grin fades. ""Seriously?""

""Yeah. Seriously.""

He stares at me. ""You've changed.""

""Yeah. I have.""

He shakes his head, muttering. ""Whatever, man. This is weird.""

He leaves.

The door slams.

Mikae watches me. Says nothing. Goes back to her work.

In the booth, Shizuru finishes the weather report. Her eyes flick to me for a second. Then away.

---

One evening, Shizuru and I are alone in the station. Mikae left early for a dentist appointment.

A pre-recorded segment is playing. Classical music. Quiet.

Then the equipment glitches. Static bursts through the speakers, harsh and sudden.

Shizuru flinches.

I move quickly. ""I can fix it.""

She hesitates. Steps back from the console.

I work in silence. Checking cables. Restarting the system.

She watches from the corner of the booth. I can feel her eyes on me. Cautious. Wary.

The static


clears. The music returns, smooth and uninterrupted.

I turn to face her. ""Shizuru, I—""

She walks out before I can finish.

The door closes softly behind her.

I stand there, screwdriver in hand, alone in the booth.

The pre-recorded segment plays on. A piano piece. Satie. *Gymnopédie No. 1*.

Slow. Melancholic. Beautiful.

I almost laugh. Almost cry.

Instead, I just stand there, listening.

---

A few days later, a call comes through on the request line. I'm filling in for Mikae during the late shift.

""Hello, you've reached Community Radio. Any requests?""

""Hey."" The voice is male, young, tired but friendly. ""Can you play something quiet? It's been a long day.""

""Sure. Any preference?""

""Dealer's choice. You sound like you'd pick something good.""

I flip through the CD collection. Pull out Coltrane. *Naima*.

""How's this?""

""Perfect. Thanks, man.""

I play it. The saxophone fills the small station. Gentle. Searching.

The caller stays on the line, silent, just listening.

After the song ends, he speaks again. ""That was exactly what I needed. You've got good taste.""

""Thanks.""

""I'm Toma, by the way.""

""Hibiki.""

""Cool. I'll call again sometime.""

He hangs up.

For a moment, I just sit there.

A stranger called. We talked about music. Nothing else.

For those few minutes, I wasn't the guy who ruined someone's life.

I was just a guy who played Coltrane.

It feels strange. Foreign. Like wearing someone else's clothes.

But I don't hate it.

---

The next week, Toma calls again. Asks for something upbeat this time. We talk for fifteen minutes about jazz, about Miles Davis versus Coltrane, about whether vinyl sounds better than digital.

Normal conversation. Easy.

I realize I haven't had a conversation like this in years.

---

One afternoon, Aya Fujimoto shows up at the station.

I'm outside, taking out the trash, when she appears. Arms crossed. Expression hard.

""You're Hibiki Tanabe.""

It's not a question.

""Yeah.""

""I'm Aya. Shizuru's friend.""

I nod. Wait.

""Stay away from her.""

""I work here.""

""Then quit.""

""I'm not trying to hurt her.""

Her eyes flash. ""You already did. Or did you forget?""

""I didn't forget.""

""Then why are you here?""

I don't have a good answer. Not one that doesn't sound selfish.

She steps closer. ""She doesn't owe you forgiveness. She doesn't owe you closure. She doesn't owe you anything.""

""I know.""

""Do you?"" She searches my face, looking for a lie. ""Because if you're here to make yourself feel better, to ease your guilt, you're using her all over again.""

That lands. Hard.

I look down. ""That's not—""

""Isn't it?"" She doesn't let me finish. ""You hurt her. She left. Now she's finally doing okay, and you show up. What do you think that does to her?""

""She was already here when I—""

""I don't care. She was fine before you came. Now she's tense all the time. Looking over her shoulder.""

Guilt twists in my stomach.

""I didn't mean—""

""You never mean to, do you?"" Her voice is cold. ""But you still do damage.""

She turns to leave, then stops.

""If you actually care about her, you'll leave. That's the only way to help.""

She walks away.

I stand there in the alley behind the station, trash bag in hand, her words echoing.

*You're using her all over again.*

Am I?

I don't know anymore.

---

That night, I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.

Aya's right.

I came here because Shizuru was here. I told myself it was to help. To atone.

But really, I just wanted to be near her. To see that she was okay. To ease my own guilt.

Selfish.

Always selfish.

I should quit.

But I don't.

---

**ACT 2.5 — The Forced Collaboration**

Two months into volunteering, it happens.

It's a Tuesday evening. Live broadcast. Shizuru's reading a poem on air. Her segment: ""Words Worth Hearing.""

She's halfway through when the microphone cuts out.

Dead silence on the broadcast.

Panic flashes across her face. She taps the mic. Nothing.

In the control room, Mikae swears. Checks the board. ""It's the cable. Hibiki, get in there. Now.""

I grab a replacement cable and rush into the booth.

Shizuru steps back, still holding the poem, hands trembling slightly.

I work fast. Unplug the dead cable. Swap it. Test the connection.

The mic crackles back to life.

""You're good,"" I whisper.

She takes a breath. Steps back to the mic.

Continues reading where she left off. Her voice doesn't shake.

*""And in the silence between words,*
*we find the space to breathe,*
*to heal,*
*to begin again.""*

She finishes the poem. Signs off gracefully.

The broadcast ends.

I'm still kneeling by the cable, unsure if I should leave.

She turns to me.

For a long moment, we just look at each other.

Then she nods. Once. Small.

I nod back.

She leaves the booth.

I stay there, cable in hand, heart pounding.

It's not forgiveness. Not even close.

But it's acknowledgment.

And for now, it's enough.

---

**ACT 3 — The Broadcast**

A month later, Mikae announces a special broadcast.

""Shizuru's doing a solo show. 'Voices That Matter.' She'll be reading listener stories about finding their voice.""

My stomach twists.

""When?""

""Friday. 8 PM.""

I nod.

---

Friday arrives.

The station is busier than usual. A few listeners show up in person to watch through the booth window.

Shizuru prepares quietly. Organizing her notes. Testing the mic.

Mikae pulls her aside. ""You sure you're ready?""

Shizuru writes on her notepad: *Yes.*

Mikae squeezes her shoulder. ""You've got this.""

---

8 PM.

Shizuru goes live.

""Good evening. This is Shizuru Aoi. Thank you for joining me tonight.""

Her voice is hesitant at first. Careful.

""Tonight, I want to share stories. From people like me. People who lost their voice. And found it again.""

She reads the first letter. From a woman who developed a stutter after a car accident. Who went years without speaking. Who found healing through poetry.

Then another. A man who went silent after losing his daughter. Who found his voice again through music.

Another. A teenager with social anxiety. Who started a podcast from their bedroom.

Story after story.

I listen from the control room, adjusting levels, making sure everything runs smoothly.

But mostly, I just listen.

Shizuru's voice grows steadier with each story. More confident.

She's not reading about herself. But in a way, she is.

Each story is a piece of her own.

Halfway through, I feel it. The urge.

To interrupt. To apologize. To tell her I'm sorry, that I see her now, that I understand.

I start to stand.

Mikae's hand lands on my shoulder. Firm.

""Don't.""

""I just—""

""You don't get to control her healing, Hibiki.""

I freeze.

""This isn't about you,"" she says quietly. ""It never was.""

I sit back down.

Listen.

Shizuru finishes the broadcast. Reads one final letter. From a middle school student who was bullied for stuttering. Who transferred schools. Who found a radio station that gave them a place to speak.

My breath catches.

""They wrote: 'I don't know if I'll ever forgive the people who hurt me. But I know I'm more than what they said I was. And that's enough.'""

Silence.

Then Shizuru speaks, her own words now.

""If you're listening tonight, and you've lost your voice—literally or otherwise—I want you to know: You don't have to be loud to matter. You don't have to be fearless. You just have to be willing. To try. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.""

She pauses.

""Thank you for listening. Goodnight.""

The broadcast ends.

Through the booth window, I see her. She's smiling. Small. Real.

People clap.

I realize: She doesn't need me to fix this.

She's already fixing herself.

---

**ACT 4 — The Bridge**

Three months pass.

I keep working at the station. Shizuru and I still don't talk much. But the tension eases. Slightly.

We exist in the same space without it feeling like a wound.

Progress, maybe.

One Saturday afternoon, I decide to walk home the long way.

Past the old bridge.

I haven't crossed it since middle school. Three years of avoidance.

But today, I do.

The river is loud. Rain from last night. The water rushes beneath, brown and turbulent.

Halfway across, I see her.

Shizuru.

Sitting on the railing, legs dangling, phone in hand. Recording the river.

My first instinct is to turn back.

But I don't.

I approach slowly. Stop a few steps away.

""I won't stay long.""

She looks at me. Nods.

Permission, maybe. Or just acknowledgment.

""I'm trying to be better,"" I say. ""You don't have to care.""

The river fills the silence.

She lowers her phone. Speaks. Slowly. Carefully.

""I know.""

Two words. But they land heavy.

""I'm sorry,"" I say. ""I know that's not enough.""

""It's not.""

I nod. Swallow hard.

Pause.

""But you're here.""

I look at her.

""You didn't run,"" she continues. ""You didn't make excuses. You just... stayed.""

My throat tightens.

""I don't forgive you.""

""I don't expect you to.""

""But I see you. Trying.""

The words hit me harder than any anger could.

""That's all I can give.""

""It's more than I deserve.""

She looks at the river. ""Maybe.""

I turn to leave.

""Hibiki.""

I stop.

""Don't come back here. To this bridge.""

I nod. Understand.

This place is hers. Her healing space.

I don't belong here.

""Okay.""

She lifts her phone again. Resumes recording.

The sound of water fills the space between us.

I walk away.

Don't look back.

---

**ACT 5 — Six Months Later**

Shizuru leads a workshop now. Every Thursday evening.

""Audio Storytelling for Beginners.""

She teaches others how to use recording equipment. How to edit. How to find their voice.

Literally and metaphorically.

I watch sometimes from the control room. She's confident now. Patient. Kind.

Explains things clearly. Encourages mistakes. Celebrates small victories.

One week, her father attends.

Daichi sits in the back, arms crossed at first. Skeptical. Protective.

But as the session continues, his posture softens.

He listens.

Really listens.

Shizuru talks about sound. About how recording gives you control. How you can replay your voice until it sounds right.

How sometimes, hearing yourself is the first step to believing in yourself.

After the session, Daichi approaches her.

He doesn't say anything.

Just hugs her.

Long. Tight.

She hugs him back.

When they pull apart, his eyes are wet.

""I'm proud of you,"" he whispers.

She nods. Smiles.

---

Toma visits the station in person for the first time.

He's younger than I expected. Early twenties. Messy hair. Bookstore employee lanyard around his neck.

""You're the guy with the good taste. Nice to finally meet you.""

We shake hands.

""Toma. Good to meet you too.""

We talk for an hour. About music. Books. He recommends a novel. I recommend an album.

Normal. Easy.

At one point, he says, ""You seem different than you sound on the phone.""

""Different how?""

""Lighter. On the phone, you always sound... I don't know. Weighted down. But in person, you smile more.""

I think about that.

""Maybe I am lighter,"" I say.

He grins. ""Good. Keep it up.""

---

One morning, Mom catches me before I leave for school.

""Hibiki. Wait.""

I stop.

She's still in her pajamas. Morning off, finally.

""You're smiling more,"" she says.

""Am I?""

""Yeah."" She looks hopeful. Careful. Like she's afraid to jinx it. ""The radio station... it's good for you.""

""Yeah. It is.""

She steps closer. Hugs me.

Quick. Tight.

""I'm proud of you. I don't know what changed, but... I'm proud.""

I hug her back.

""Thanks, Mom.""

She pulls away, wiping her eyes.

""Go. You'll be late.""

I leave, but I'm smiling.

One afternoon, outside the station, I see a kid struggling with broken headphones.

Maybe ten years old. Frustrated. Hitting them against his hand.

""Hey. Those broken?""

He looks up. ""Yeah. Only one side works.""

I pull out my own headphones. Hand them over.

""Here. Take these.""

He looks suspicious. ""These don't work right either.""

""One side's broken. But you only need one side to start listening.""

He takes them. Skeptical but grateful.

""Thanks, mister.""

He runs off.

I watch him go.

Think about broken things.

How sometimes they still work.

Just differently.

---

That evening, Shizuru is on air. Closing her weekly show.

I'm in the control room, adjusting levels, monitoring the feed.

Through the glass, we make eye contact.

No smile. No wave.

Just a small nod.

I nod back.

She returns to her broadcast.

I return to my work.

---

Later, walking home, I cross the bridge.

Not the one where I saw Shizuru. A different one.

The river is calm tonight. Reflecting streetlights.

I stop in the middle.

Think about distance.

How some distances never close.

How some damage never fully heals.

But how you can still move forward.

Still try.

Still listen.

---

The bridge didn't erase the distance between us.

It just made it safe to cross.

1qiy1av,https://www.reddit.com/r/gender/comments/1qiy1av/my_diary_entry_on_hating_being_a_man_lately/,My diary entry on hating being a man lately,"I am drinking cola while listening to Lana Del Rey. I don't know her and probably wouldn't agree totally with her on some things because of her controversies BUT we feel the same pain. On the way from dermatologist I thought of Virginia Woolf's diary. I love diaries. Now on this site I got love from but also saw so much hate, Reddit, someone said how they're just giving up on making friends (since its according to te post hard to do in Germany since Germans are private people according to them) and they're focusing on themselves and talking with themselves thru diary. Thats a god point and I love that being an artist eventho a curse currently makes suffering a inspiration to wirte and especially books. 

What am I insane about? I want to let it out. I hate being a man, we are so cruel, so limited, so primal. I mean the whole world is like that but at least women have their freedom, they stand for freedom, diversity, sensibilisity and beauty in the world. They don't like us either actually. Even straight women are into other women - ""women are just more beautiful, sensual, ellegant"". So we men are disgusting beings - we are rapists, murderers, the ones with closed mindset, just roughness and hate - women hate us and we hate other men. Women stand for freedom, art, empathy, creation, care for humans, animals, planet, beauty, sensuality, fluidity,  - all things I find beautiful and which actually matter and make sence out of this existance. If I do these things do you think I can really be celebrated? I mean yeah women in my life loved me and some boys too but... I have a feeling in mainstream narrative, these beautiful things can not belong to me because I am a man. I always found my bisexuality (eventho I am leaning towards women in relationships) to be something great until I got on Reddit. This Reddit. Social media fucked me up. Something that gave a 11yo me a platform tro meet the world now destroys my world and the world in general because of this dumb polarisation and dumbification of people as we werent dumb enough. I hate the left and the right for this. Heidi Reinichek (germaqn leftist politician) saying how ""the problem are men"" and there comes the neo-nazi bullshit from AfD taking those hurt men but only under the condition that they turn into those toxic men. Being masculine basically means being an emotionless ruthless all-capable killer robot. Me standing for those beautfiul things that  mentioned makes me feminine and feminine is bad and pathetic, but at least a woman can be feminine a man can't. I love that we have broaden femininity, oh my you can be a woman in sooo many ways and this is beautfiul, but a man? Masculinity is more fragile that a wine glass. Everything you do as a man is gay. I have a feeling I can't have a personality without getting those accusations. This is sad. And women when they're struggling at least have a whole community to support them. As I was on a site of my University's Counceling support they had an extra ""women therapy"" but no extra ""men's therapy"" eventho men are 3/4 of all suicides. Why can't we be equal? I willnot give up on my self I promised myself that I will give myself a chance to live this year after everything I fought the last years but if it doesn't get better after EVERYTHING I am trying, I am going to end myself in 2027.

Ofc it isn't all black and white eventho my anxiety makes me think that, there is a ""Men therapy"" by Caritas and ofc we talk about men issues but not in the way I would like it to be. Let's see what happens, I will just chill in this era of me, enjoy sensations like my morning coffee, organic food I bought for cheap, some experimental music maybe and ofc some books and games omg I love games they are saving me, the only thing that never bothers me.",1,1769002498.0,gender,0,1.0,False

*CW: Homophobia, violence, bullying*

An hour is more than enough time to fuck up a friendship. Apparently. I didn't realize that when I told Jacob my feelings for him (the big gay feelings that my older brother teased me about) that he would punch me and tell me he couldn't be friends with fa—you know the word. I think that's what hurt the most about it. Not the rejection. Not even the punch, although it was hard enough that I passed out in the locker room. It was the word. He said it with such loathing. Let me back up a bit.

On Monday this week, Peter, the older brother I mentioned, was bragging about sex with his girlfriend to me. He’s in his second year of university, splitting time between the house and his dorm-turned-love-nest. He would tell me everything about it. I think he did it to make me uncomfortable. He knows I'm gay. I've been out since I was 11, almost six years ago, but he still tells me all the weird things that men and women do together. I should probably be clear. I don't think the act itself is weird. Just how things work is weird. To me. Because I'm gay. Does that make sense?

Anyways. After sharing all the details about things I most certainly did not want to know, he looked at me, a very strange and calculating expression on his face, and asked, ""So. Spencer. Sucked any good cock lately?""

I choked. Like, he thought I had a piece of chicken stuck in my throat and tried to do the Heimlich maneuver on me. I elbowed him off of me. Wiping tears from my eyes, I attempted to glare. It didn't work. Watery glares are not scary. Peter just guffawed.

""Please, Spencer, don't tell me you're a virgin. DUDE. You're almost 17. I lost mine at like 12.""

I didn't dignify that with a response. People bloom at their own pace, I thought to myself. He kept jabbering on about how awesome it was and the things I could learn from watching porn—which I do, by the way. I don't know a single boy who doesn't—and what it means for a relationship between a boy and a girl.

""I'm gay,"" I reminded him.

He faltered. ""Yeah. I know. I was just saying... Never mind. Spence, you have to get a boyfriend. Isn't there anyone?""

This is what I love about my big brother. He's crude, he's an ass, but he does look out for me and pushes me outside my comfort zone. My best friend Maria says it his way of coping with FeelingsTM and loving his little brother. She also agrees I need a boyfriend. And sex. Tells me I'm too wound-up sometimes.

""Jacob.""

""Who?""

""Jacob Meyer. Pitcher for the baseball team. Goalie for the soccer team. Straight A's. Loves math and is reading George R.R. Martin because our English teacher suggested it. Tall-ish. Sandy hair. Chocolate eyes. Sun-kissed skin. Baritone voice at 17.""

Peter stared. ""You are so totally GONE for him!""

I blushed but nodded. We spent an hour talking tactics about what to say and how to dress. It was Peter who suggested the locker room. Looking back, that was a terrible idea.

It took me until Thursday to get enough confidence to say something. Gym class that day was a particularly brutal match of dodgeball. Poor Logan turned his back on his classmate-enemies, and he was pummeled by every rubber ball imaginable. We all laughed as he fell to the floor, moaning and begging for mercy. Jacob stood next to me, hands on his hips, one knee popped out as he watched.

""That dude is not gonna sit straight tomorrow, man,"" he whispered to me. I looked at him out of the corner of my eye, my breath shallow. His sweaty hair was matted to his head in the most beautiful way, and he was fanning himself with his shirt. He winked at me. I almost swooned but stayed strong. The whistle blew, we went to the locker room, and 30 nasty boys showered and cleaned up for class. Except Logan. He'd gone to the nurse's office. Poor guy.

Jacob usually takes longer than everyone else to get dressed. I took longer that day, too. Waited until everyone else was gone. Checked the showers and the toilets. No one.

""Hey, Jacob... Can I ask you something?""

Chocolate eyes and a rogueish grin turned to me. ""Sure, man. Sup?""

""Would..."" I trailed off, stomach twisting in knots. I blamed the smell of boy-sweat for that instead of the anxiety that made my hands feel clammy.

""Wood?"" Jacob looked down at his pants and then mine. ""No wood here!""

I laughed despite myself, and that made the words come easily. ""Would you want to go on a date with me tomorrow night? After the game?""

He stared at me. Someone laughed. Two someones laughed. Someone said, ""The f-- has a crush on you Jakey!""

Jacob's expression hardened. ""I'm not a f--,"" he hissed. ""Stay away from me, homo. I'm not friends with f---.""

That last one was yelled. I heard a high-five echo in the locker room.

Jacob turned to go. I grabbed his shoulder, and his fist was suddenly in my stomach.

""Don't touch me, f--.""

I coughed. Felt like my stomach was going to come out of my throat. I doubled over as stars and static filled my vision.

""Fucking gross,"" said another boy, not Jacob. ""Laid him out clean, Jakey-boy.""

""Let's go,"" Jacob said acidly. I felt spit hit my face as the world went dark.

\*\*\*

Maria was waiting at my locker Friday morning. She had my favorite coffee order (a lavender mocha made with coconut milk and no whipped cream) and donuts. Boston cream. My fave.

“Hi honey,” she greeted softly. “He's been suspended. One week.”

I grunted in response, twirling the combination lock with my code. My stomach still hurt, a nasty bruise discoloring my skin. I had puked at some point in the locker, did it again at home, and wanted to now.

“Good. Stupid bastard.” I snatched the mocha from her and took a massive swig, drinking nearly half of it. My stomach calmed in pleasure. We walked to our first class in silence. It was humiliating. Seemed like everyone was staring at me. Whispering. Jacob’s buddies were very pointedly not looking at me. I couldn't concentrate and just doodled in my notebooks all day, drawing endless spirals and mazes, birds flying above them, worms burrowing into dirt beneath them. I drew what blacking out had looked like to me. Mx. Hernandez told me again that I should really pursue art at a university because I had ""vision"" and ""voice."" I don't even know what that means.

I was numb. Mr. Voss asked me the same question three times. I just stared at him before he gave up and asked someone else. Peter had threatened to murder Jacob. He wasn't kidding. I told him to calm down. People were allowed to reject date offers.

""Dude. What the fuck is wrong with you?"" he'd screamed. Dad immediately chastised him for the language. We're an oversharing kind of family. ""He punched you. He called you a slur. You should punch him back. In the dick.""

That got him sent to his room and his Saturday night date cancelled. He remained indignant on my behalf. I don't know how my parents managed to still parent their twenty-year-old son like that, but it happened. Best big brother, that guy.

When the final bell rang, I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Maria suggested we call an Uber home.

“I'm walking,” I told her. She protested, said three miles was too long. I glared. Pointedly. Best friend glares *are* scary glares. She walked with me instead of arguing. No talking. Just a slow, meandering walk, cars rushing by, joggers greeting us, and one asshole biker not announcing he was coming up on our left. My foot snared in his tire, knocking him over. He yelled some choice words at us as Maria and I stuck our middle fingers up at him.

That night and Saturday passed in a daze. Sunday morning came, and I woke up with a smile. Church today with the cute new pastor telling us that today was the one-year anniversary of our congregation becoming open-and-affirming. He invited all the LGBT+ members to stand. We did. People applauded politely. Dad clapped my back. Peter whooped like a child. I blushed.

After the service, we came home to a car parked in front of our house. My heart sank at seeing Jacob and his mom sitting in it. Mom told us all to wait in the car. She had that mama bear look on her face, the one she only got when something serious was happening, like the time Peter got into a fight defending the new kid from an upperclassman. I don't know what happened exactly. Just, she came back from the meeting with the principal with a very wide and satisfied smile. She was awesome.

I watched as she and Mrs. Meyer talked. Mom's arms were crossed as Mrs. Meyer gestured emphatically. Mom nodded, said something that Mrs. Meyer agreed to. When she got back to the car, she opened my door.

“Jackie brought Jacob to apologize. Do you want to hear it?” I shrugged. She gave me a small smile. “Why don’t you hear him out, pumpkin, hmm?”

“…okay…”

Jacob met me on my porch. He was tense, shoulders almost at his ears, and looked like he'd been crying for hours. He avoided looking at me. Coward.

“Uh… Hey, Spencer,” he started, voice small.

“Just say whatever you need to say,” I said icily. He recoiled.

“Um… yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah. I… Coach benched me. I'm not playing in Tuesday's game. Because… What I did. And… Like. I'm sorry I punched you.”

*I'm sorry I punched you.* Not, “I called you a really detestable slur, and then I punched you, and that was so not cool of me.” Just, *I'm sorry I punched you.*

“Sucks to be you,” I spat. “Poor Jacob doesn't get one game of baseball.” I shoved past him, knocking him with my shoulder and slamming the door. Fuck that guy.

I texted Maria that night about the “apology.”

“What a dick move,” she sent. “Want me to bring that pen I carved? Looks like a knife? I can make a little doll of him and you can stab it every time you think of him.”

I giggled at that. “Not a bad idea… Jk… Don't do that.”

Monday was weird. Most of my classes that day usually had Jacob. His absence was obvious. His buddies mentioned it. Teachers called his name from obligation, sighed in sadness—he's pretty popular with everyone—and moved on. Every time his name was mentioned, glances were thrown my way. Great. I’d become the school HomoTM.

Tuesday was better. No classes on T-days with him. Or his buddies. Thank God.

Usually I went to every single baseball game. Because Jacob. Not that one. I cried in bed instead. Our team lost by an epic 22-0. The serve.

Wednesday and Thursday were fine. No one stared at me or whispered about me. They just ignored me, turned around when they saw me, and left me alone. How had I become the pariah? I was *assaulted*. And slurred.

Friday brought a gut punch. Jacob  would be back in the halls and on the field. He was greeted with choruses of “Welcome back” and “Win us the game tonight, bro!” Their world had returned to order. Mine felt like it was crumbling.

In science lab, after Mrs. Pereira gave instructions on how dissecting frogs, I heard Jacob telling off one of his baseball buddies.

“Don't call him that.” His tone was… pained? And harsh. And who was “he?” Me? And if it was me, don't call me what? F--. The thing he couldn't apologize for. HYPOCRITE.

I told Maria about it as we snuck sips from a flask before the game that night. Don't judge. Teens make stupid decisions all the time. She had a thoughtful look on her face but refused to tell me what she was thinking. She normally did that whenever she had guessed something I would understand soon enough. It was annoying. I loved her for it.

She suggested we could skip the game. I refused. Despite, or maybe in spite of, what had happened, I wanted to go. I loved baseball. Tried to play when I was a kid, but I wasn't very good at it. That's how I first met Jacob. Same youth team. He was already amazing at the game at 10. That's when my crush started.

Maria got us soda and hot dogs and jabbered away about her poetry, her annoying little shitstain brother—her words, not mine—and the universities she was applying to. I didn't really listen, hunched over, elbows on my knees, and doing my best not to keep letting my eyes wander over to Jacob in the bullpen. I wondered about that. He was our star pitcher. He should have been on the mound after missing Tuesday's game.

And damn. He looked so good in a baseball uniform. It did things to me.

After the game, a hard-won 1-0 victory, I felt someone pull me under the bleachers. Maria called for me. I told her I was fine. I'd meet her at the car. I eyed who'd grabbed me. It was Jacob. In his uniform. He looked distraught.

""Spencer... I...""

I crossed my arms and glared.

Jacob did something I hadn't seen him do since he got hit between the legs by a baseball at 11: he cried.

""I'm so sorry.""

""...what?""

“What I said. I don't want… I’m not gonna say it again. I'm so sorry I said it.” I could only stare. I felt cold despite the late summer heat. His head was hung low. His hand grabbed the orange cap on his head, and he scratched it. “I... Um. So Wednesdays, we have this thing for the parish. It's like for teens to come to the cathedral and be a community or whatever, but, uh, this week's lesson was on confession and being honest and making things right with people you'd wronged. Father Alessandro said that hiding things and lying is the thing that eats at you, and I…”

He trailed off, staring straight down at his feet. I stood there, silently, arms crossed, doing my best to channel Mom's mama bear energy. For some unknown reason, I felt like he needed a break from whatever was tearing at him. I asked why he hadn't pitched tonight.

His eyes, those damn chocolate eyes, found mine as he whispered, “Mom has me benched for the season. Coach wanted me off the team, but Mom convinced him the worse punishment was watching the games from the bullpen. She's right. It sucks. I'm not officially part of the team anymore, but Mom is making me come anyways.”

I laughed. “Good. Hope you lose out on scholarships next year.”

That was apparently *not* the right thing to say. He sobbed. Words came from him but none of them made sense underneath his strained cries. I almost cried with him. Whatever *this* was… It was affecting him hard. He wiped his eyes and nose with his sleeve, snot and tears mixing on the orange material. Gross. He spoke again.

""The guys. They... I don't... I wanted to say yes. Only one person knows I'm gay. And I didn't think you liked guys like me. You're so artsy. Not athletic. Not that there's anything wrong with artsy! And you're cute. And I'm so sorry, and I just reacted, and I hate myself. My mom is so mad at me for what I did.""

The words tumbled out of him like a dam had burst. Rage was all I felt. My fist found his face—sorry, Peter, but punching a dude in his dick is not cool. He took the punch. Looked at me. Tears stained his cheeks, eye black streaked through.

""Yeah. Yeah. I... deserved that.""

""You did,"" I agreed. ""You're an asshole. You could have just said, 'No.' Did you know people could do that?""

His eyes found the ground. I felt like I had kicked a puppy.

""And you called me a 'f--.' DUDE!""

""Yeah... That was... I'm sorry.""

""Don't ever let me hear you say that word again. In any context.""

""Yeah. Okay. Yeah.""

I raised my fist again and paused. I wanted to stay angry. It felt like the thing you're supposed to do. I wanted to want to punch him again. Instead, I just looked at this boy, and my heart melted. Peter was right. I was way too gone for this guy.

""Would you... Would you still wannagoonadatewimme?"" he wobbled.

Did I? This boy had punched me, called me a slur, looked far too good in a baseball uniform, and was whining like a puppy in front of me, and had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to go on a date with him?

“Jake…”

“You don't have to.”

I sighed in exasperation. “I know. I… I've had a crush on you since we were eleven.”

Watery eyes found. Watery eyes really weren't scary by any measure. They were… kind of adorable.

“Really?”

""Yes,"" I said too quickly. How was my mouth ahead of my brain? I hadn't forgiven him yet.

“Mine started when we were eight. You probably don't remember, but my mom was your guys's realtor when you first moved here.”

WHAT?

I think I made noises. I must have. Jacob laughed in an awkward, strangled sort of way.

“Yeah… Um. I told Mom that day I thought you were cute. She reminded me when we got home after she met with Principal Hertz.”

Or maybe I had. People are allowed to make mistakes, I reminded myself, even ones that are terrible. I could stand here, let anger claw at me, or I could do what mom always did: Take a breath, and tell myself that forgiveness is the harder choice but the right choice. Did you know that people could make that choice?

I slapped him. That was a good compromise. Not a punch, which felt sharp to me. Open hand, make him feel everything. That was… It had that quality of a cymbal but transformed for human skin. It felt… Right.

“Yeah. That one, too,” agreed Jake.

“Damn right,” I said.

“So… Date?”

“Ask me again in a month.”

“That long?”

“You punched me. You called me a f--. Yes. A damn month.”

“A month. Okay. Yeah. Can I text you?”

“Yes. About school. Nothing else. One message that mentions anything but schoolwork and I'm out. Got it?” The puppy Jacob had become nodded. Oh. That was… I was not going down that path right now.

I left him there, under the bleachers. He needed his own time to figure things out. I suggested he start coming out to people. He told me he was telling his best friend later that night at the after party. He told me I should come. I refused.

Maria was waiting for me in the parking lot.

“So?”

“You already knew.”

“I did.”

“How?”

“I have my ways,” she wiggled her eyebrows at me. “Also, his eyes follow you everywhere. Anyone actually paying attention would have noticed. He's gone for you, baby boy.”

That brought the first mirthful laugh to my lips in a week. She drove us back to my home, blasting Magnolia Park, screaming our heads off to the lyrics. Peter greeted us at the door, back for the weekend from university.

“No girlfriend?” I questioned.

“She told me that women shouldn't have jobs.”

“Ew,” Maria and I agreed in unison. Peter barked a laugh.

We sat on the porch, talking, sipping sodas when Mom and Dad joined us, stealing sips from Maria's flask when they weren't paying attention, and talked late into the night.

At some point, Peter asked me, “So… Jacob?”

Mom and Dad were standing on the driveway, looking at the car. They’d gone suspiciously still. Parents were not as subtle as they thought they were.

I looked at Maria. She nodded.

“He finally, actually apologized.”

“And..?”

“Petey, my boy—” He *hated*  when I started pretend-wise—“an hour under the bleachers is more than enough time to fuck up a friendship and, maybe, start something new.” I winked at him.

He whooped. My parents coughed awkwardly. Serves them right. Maria beamed.

One month later, I sat in a booth across from Jacob as he told me about the four scholarships he'd received to be NCAA baseball pitcher.

My world had righted.

\*\*\*

The daily writing practice I’ve set for myself has three rules:

1. Write a new piece every day
2. 500 words minimum within two hours
3. Post without revision, without polish

But the first draft of this story didn’t feel ready for a wider audience beyond the online competition it was written for. I had to break my own rules. The important part of this practice is personal consistency. Rule 3 is the last on purpose. *Under the Bleachers* satisfied the first two, but its ending glossed over the consequences. Jacob was forgiven too quickly, and the consequences for his choices were too light. The ending hadn’t been earned yet.

I even knew the exact moment in the narrative where something was off. I kept the line, because it’s both an artifact of how my brain was operating and completely true to Spencer: *How was my mouth ahead of my brain? I hadn’t forgiven him yet.*

This revision is my attempt to honor that truth.

1qixzen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1qixzen/rethinking_armor_durability_making_gear_matter/,Rethinking Armor Durability: Making Gear Matter Without Slowing Play,"This idea started the way most dangerous rules ideas do: mid-session, half a cup of cold coffee in, watching players do something clever that the rules technically allow… but fictionally feels off.

**Armor.**

Specifically, armor that just *keeps working*.

In **Rotted Tropicz**, the characters are scraping by in heat, salt air, blood, rot, and bad decisions. Gear matters. Equipment is supposed to feel *temporary*. And yet armor, by virtue of being a static number, has this quiet immortality. You get it, you wear it, and unless the GM actively rips it away, it just… exists. Forever. Untouched by time, trauma, or the fact that you’ve been shoulder-checked by a Super-Z twice this session.

That’s the crack in the wall that got my brain spinning.

Because the *idea* of armor degrading? I love it. It fits the genre. It reinforces scarcity. It adds tension. It makes survival choices matter. It tells a story without box text.

But then the other half of my brain kicked in, the part that’s been burned before, and asked the real question:

**Is the squeeze worth the juice?**

Because we’ve all seen how this goes. Durability tracks. Armor HP. Thresholds. Condition states. “Make a note that your chest piece has 7 integrity left.” And suddenly the table feels like it’s doing taxes. The fiction slows down. The players forget to mark things. The GM forgets to enforce it. And a rule that *looked* elegant on paper turns into friction at the table.

So the problem isn’t *whether* armor should degrade. The problem is **how do you make it matter without making it annoying?**

That’s the line I’m walking.

What I don’t want is tracking damage over time. That’s a hard no. If a rule requires a pencil eraser more than imagination, it’s already losing me. Rotted Capes lives in the space where pressure comes from decisions, not bookkeeping.

So instead, I’ve been thinking about ***signals*** rather than ***stats.***

What if armor doesn’t slowly degrade, but instead fails at dramatically appropriate moments?

What if it’s not about “losing 1 point of protection,” but about crossing narrative fault lines?

One approach is tying armor damage to ***consequences***, not hits. A normal success? Armor holds. A mixed result, complication, or GM-triggered fallout? That’s when the armor takes the hit *for you*. It saves your skin… but it’s done. Bent plates. Torn straps. Cracked visor. Still wearable, but no longer trustworthy.

Another angle is scarcity without math. Armor doesn’t degrade numerically; it degrades ***fictionally*****.** The GM tells you it’s compromised. You know it. Everyone at the table knows it. From that moment on, it’s living on borrowed time. The next bad break, it’s gone. No tracking. Just tension.

You could even lean into ***player agency***. Let them choose. “You can ignore this injury, but your armor is wrecked,” or “You keep the armor intact, but take the hit.” Now armor isn’t just defense, it’s a resource players actively spend when things go sideways.

And of course, there’s the ***blunt option***: armor only protects you a finite number of times per session or per arc. No tracking damage. No numbers ticking down. Just a quiet understanding that protection isn’t infinite, and when it runs out, it *runs out loudly*.

The common thread in all of this is intent. The rule isn’t there to punish players or simulate metallurgy. It’s there to reinforce tone. To make the world feel harsh. To remind players that survival isn’t about stacking bonuses. It’s about choosing when to spend what little safety you have.

So yeah. I love the idea of armor getting wrecked. I just refuse to make it a chore.

That’s the design tension I keep circling back to: rules should create *pressure*, not paperwork. If a mechanic doesn’t speed up the story, sharpen decisions, or make the fiction hit harder, it doesn’t belong, no matter how realistic it looks on paper.

But I’m curious where you land.

Is armor durability worth it if it’s lightweight and narrative-driven? Or is this one of those ideas that sounds great in theory and dies at the table?

What’s the cleanest version of this rule you’ve seen, or would you even want it at all?",14,1769002359.0,RPGdesign,7,0.82,False

I would really appreciate any advice at all. Thank you all 💗

Location: ENGLAND, UK (flight to India)

I was on a flight from LHR (London, UK) to IGI (Delhi, India) which is about a 10-10.5 hour flight. I will summarize some of the info below so it is an easier read:

\- this was on 14 Dec 2025, night flight

\- boarding delayed at LHR by 30 min

\- flight estimated to be delayed by 40 min

\- landed at Delhi airport at 11:55am (IST)

\- made to wait in aircraft till 16:20pm (IST)

\- in aircraft for almost 4.5 hours

\- wait was due to smog in Delhi and nowhere for the aircraft to park

\- told by pilot we will deplane multiple times yet we did not

\- no refreshments, snacks or even water passed around

\- chaos in the aircraft (people missing connecting flights, elderly and sick people not having their medication or water to take medication with, etc)

\- flight attendant yelling at passenger and speaking rudely to them upon asking for water and updates

\- took 1.5 hour to get water for an elderly passenger near me

\- not allowed to use bathroom for first 1.5 hour after landing

\- WiFi shut off for the duration of being landed but in flight (they had free WiFi on board)

\- in an aircraft so obviously a lot of passengers including myself had no signal for the 4.5 hours we were there to contact anyone

Anyways, I raised a complaint for compensation to air india mentioning all of the above. They have asked for flight details which I provided (although id already sent this in my initial message). They have now replied to me after over a month with this email below:

We completely understand the concern, we would like to begin by extending our heartfelt empathy for the discomfort experienced.

Please be advised that despite our continuous efforts to operate all flights punctually, unforeseen circumstances may occasionally lead to last‑minute cancellations, delays, or disruptions. In this instance, the schedule of flight AI2018 from London to Mumbai was impacted due to operational reasons, including air traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, and airfield congestion. These factors resulted in a delay in the allocation of the parking bay, and the flight was held on the runway by officials until clearance was provided. Additionally, the schedule of the return flight AI111 from Delhi to London was also affected due to operational requirements.

While we completely understand the discomfort caused, we would like to share that during the prolonged ground holding period, the Captain made regular announcements to keep passengers informed of the situation. Considering the extended duration after landing, passengers were permitted to use the lavatories to ensure comfort. The onboard crew continuously monitored the cabin, maintained calm communication, and extended all possible assistance. Water bottles, tea/coffee, and cookies were distributed repeatedly as per availability; however, due to the extended delay of nearly four hours post‑landing, onboard stock was eventually limited which resulted into to delayed service.

Your feedback regarding the inflight cabin service, airport services is invaluable to us, as it helps us identify areas for improvement and take corrective measures to ensure a better experience for our guests in the future. We are committed to addressing the concerns you encountered and would like to assure you that immediate steps are being taken to strengthen our service delivery.

We strive to uphold the highest standards of service and adhere to all applicable regulations, including those set forth by the authorities. As per the regulations, compensation/reimbursement is inapplicable in cases where the delay is deemed to be beyond the control of the airline and falls within certain parameters specified by the authority. While we understand the concern and frustration that flight delays can cause however, we are unable to honor the request for compensation.

We hope for the opportunity to serve you again in the future. Your satisfaction remains our utmost priority, and we aim to regain your trust in Air India.

Please feel free to contact us in case any further assistance is required.

Am I able to claim any compensation at all for this or should I just let it go? I did pay £1K for this flight so I’m annoyed by the experience and how they handled it. To add, my flight back was delayed by an hour from departure at 06:15 to 07:30am as well.",0,1769002132.0,LegalAdviceUK,7,0.5,False

For some people, coffee is fine and even helpful because of antioxidants. For others, it can:

* Trigger acid reflux or gut issues
* Increase anxiety or stress
* Worsen headaches or joint pain
* Mess with sleep (which makes inflammation worse)

So coffee isn’t universally “good” or “bad” — it’s personal.

What surprised me is that drinks can sometimes affect inflammation as much as food. When I started paying attention to what I was drinking, I found alternatives that actually helped me feel better.

This article helped me discover drinks that may reduce inflammation (not just coffee):

Read a ton of psychology research, listened to podcasts from relationship experts like Esther Perel and Dr. John Gottman, watched countless videos breaking down attachment theory. The patterns became clear. Most people focus on butterflies and chemistry, but those fade fast. What actually predicts long term happiness? Way different stuff than what TikTok tells you.

Here's what actually matters based on behavioral science and people who study this stuff for a living, not just romantic fantasy.

They make you feel safe enough to be annoying. Sounds weird but hear me out. Dr. Sue Johnson, who literally created Emotionally Focused Therapy, talks about how secure attachment means you can show your worst self without fear. Not just your cute quirks. Your actual annoying habits, your 3am anxious spirals, your irrational jealousy moments. If you're constantly performing or walking on eggshells, your nervous system never gets to relax. Real intimacy happens when someone sees you being kind of pathetic and doesn't bolt. This doesn't mean being a dick to them, it means they create space for your full humanity. Research shows that relationships where people feel psychologically safe have way higher satisfaction rates long term.

They repair after arguments instead of stonewalling. Gottman's research on thousands of couples found that it's not whether you fight, it's how you recover. Healthy couples reconnect within hours, not days. They apologize without making it about them. They actually change the behavior instead of just saying sorry. Stonewalling, the silent treatment, ghosting during conflict, those are huge red flags according to the data. Someone who can say ""I messed up, here's what I'll do differently"" is gold. The app Paired has good exercises for this if you want to practice healthier conflict patterns together.

They're genuinely curious about your inner world. Not just asking ""how was your day"" while scrolling their phone. They remember random stuff you mentioned three weeks ago. They ask follow up questions. They want to understand WHY you think the way you do, not just WHAT you think. Psychologist Arthur Aron's research on building intimacy shows that deep curiosity and reciprocal self disclosure are what create lasting bonds. If someone only talks about surface level stuff or constantly redirects conversations back to themselves, that's not partner material. Real connection requires someone who actually gives a shit about what makes you tick.

They celebrate your wins without making it weird. This one's subtle but huge. Shelly Gable's research on ""active constructive responding"" found that how partners react to good news predicts relationship success better than how they handle bad news. When you get promoted or accomplish something, do they get genuinely hyped? Or do they minimize it, change the subject, or somehow make it about them? Someone who feels threatened by your success or can't fully celebrate you is gonna become dead weight. You want someone who's your biggest fan, not your competitor.

They have their own life and encourage you to have yours. Codependency gets romanticized but it's actually super unhealthy. Esther Perel talks about how desire needs space, mystery needs autonomy. If they freak out when you have plans without them, if they need constant reassurance, if they don't have hobbies or friends of their own, run. Healthy relationships are two whole people choosing each other, not two halves desperately clinging together. The book Attached by Amir Levine breaks down attachment styles in relationships and it's honestly eye opening about why some people drain you while others energize you. 

If you're trying to understand these patterns deeper, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from relationship psychology research, expert talks, and books like the ones mentioned here. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific like ""understanding secure attachment in dating"" or ""recognizing emotional availability,"" and it generates personalized audio content from quality sources. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 15minute overviews to detailed 40minute deep dives with real examples. It's been useful for connecting dots between different relationship concepts without having to piece together ten different books.

Secure people maintain their identity while being deeply connected. That's the sweet spot.

They show up for the boring unglamorous stuff. Anyone can be romantic on vacation or during the honeymoon phase. But who's there when you have food poisoning? When your parent is in the hospital? When you're stressed about work and not fun to be around? Reliability is underrated as hell. Small consistent actions, taking out the trash without being asked, remembering your coffee order, checking in when you're having a rough week, that stuff compounds. It's not exciting but it's what actually matters years down the line. Dr. Gary Chapman's research on love languages shows that feeling loved happens through consistent everyday actions, not grand gestures.

They make you want to be better without making you feel like shit. There's a difference between someone who inspires growth and someone who criticizes you into changing. A keeper makes you want to level up because their standards are high for themselves too. They lead by example. They don't nag or parent you, but their presence naturally motivates you to work on yourself. Psychologist Carol Dweck's work on growth mindset applies here. You want a partner who believes people can evolve and who's actively working on themselves. Not someone who's stuck or who treats you like a fixer upper project.

Look, nobody's perfect and relationships take work regardless. But these patterns show up early if you're paying attention. Most people ignore red flags because they're attached to potential instead of reality. Trust your gut. If something feels off, it usually is. You're not asking for too much by wanting someone who's emotionally available, consistent, and brings out your best self. That should be baseline, not some impossible fantasy.",1,1769002050.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

They regularly follow each other and there have been comment about that from customers as well. 

What’s worse, the manager is working less: besides taking their own break, he regularly spends time with said coworker when she’s having her break - which also means that the rest of us have to work harder. The coworker also has been taking advantage of that as she’s taking longer breaks.

It sounds more polished. I’m happy inside. Things are peachy. With fuzz so nice. I can’t forget cabbage.  I’m fermenting cabbage soon.

Holy shit this got meta.

“I’m so happy you support me!” She squealed.

“You smell like magic,” I tell her lost in the musk of her sandalwood.  “You smell like fruit loops,” I offer genuinely and through a haze of divine fog scentef like fruit loop flowing through my head. 

“Fruit loops,” she said thrusting her nose and lips up. “Ew what’s wrong with you?”  

That I’m sitting here with you at all is the problem, I think to myself. I get up to go.

Door is locked.

What!  I’m pinned in!  

Fiona giggled. 

She’s now a guy.  She’s a guy.  She’s got a beard. 

“I love you, Odin!” I cried to her.  “There’s no way in hell that I don’t love you Fiona Odin Meyers,” I said using her full name. “But  your followers are reporting me wherever I go. This sucks for me.”

I pause.  I won’t to tell her a bunch of things.  I want to tell her, “you should just appreciate I like you enough to tell you that you smell like fruit loops.” I say it calmly. 

“Listen Ava Maria,” she pouted at me trying to remind me I’m a difficult diva. “You don’t tell people they smell like fruit loops.  It’s a cereal.”

Was that a dare?

“Listen, everyone, hello,” \*mic tap\* “I want you all to know you smell like fruit loops and that I’m the biggest, baddest t-Rex around and I want to eat you.  I want to keep you as little pet chickens, fatten you up and oh wait,”

I’m just hungry for breakfast.  Never mind.  “Hey Fiona, feed me.  Pancakes.  Feed me pancakes.  Lots of them. I’m perfect.” 

I make a run for the door while she’s cooking pancakes.  I prefer egg McMuffin.  I need Diet Coke. I unlatch the door.  I gotta go.  ",4,1769001854.0,PsycheOrSike,0,0.83,False
1qixrug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1qixrug/aitj_for_cutting_off_my_friend_from_my_employee/,AITJ for cutting off my friend from my employee discount after she kept pushing it?,"



I (28F) work at a mid range grocery chain that’s been getting more expensive every month, so my employee discount actually matters to me. The rule is we can use it for ourselves and immediate household, and sometimes there are “friends and family” days where you can scan your badge and a guest gets it too, but it’s still tied to your account. My friend “Lena” (29F) has been struggling financially for real, and I’ve helped her in little ways before, grabbing her coffee, bringing extra toiletries, that kind of stuff. A couple months ago she asked if she could come with me on my shift end and use my discount on groceries once in a while. I said yes, but I was very clear: only when I’m there, only her own stuff, and only occasionally because it shows up on my account and I’m not risking my job. The first two times were normal and I felt good about it, like okay, we’re adults, we help each other. Then she started “adding” things. Like she’d show up with a second cart and be like, “Oh it’s for my cousin too, she has kids” or “My roomate sent money, it’s fine.” I told her no, that’s not how it works, and she got all wounded and said I was being stingy when she’s “just trying to survive.” After that she began texting me constantly about when I’m working, like she was scheduling my life around her shopping. If I didn’t answer fast she’d get snippy. One day she shows up without telling me, waits near the registers, and hands me a list saying she already picked everything and just needs me to scan. The list had stuff that screamed resale, like stacks of baby formula, energy drinks by the case, and two huge packs of laundry pods. I said I’m not doing that. She laughed like I was joking and said, “Don’t be dramatic, nobody cares.” I told her management does care, and I care, and I’m not risking getting fired so she can play coupon queen. She got angry and said I “owe” her because she’s been there for me emotionally, which was a wild thing to hear out loud. I told her friendship isn’t a subscription service you pay with 10 percent off groceries, and that I’m done letting her use my discount at all. Now she’s telling mutual friends I cut her off when she needed help, and one of them called me harsh and said I could’ve just set firmer boundaries instead of “punishing” her. But I DID set boundaries and she kept pushing until it turned into a whole scheme. I feel guilty because money is tight right now for a lot of people, but I also feel like she was testing how far she could go, and she didn’t care if I got in trouble. AITJ for shutting it down completely instead of giving her one more chance? TL;DR: I let a friend use my employee discount occasionally, she kept expanding it to other people and weird bulk buys, so I cut her off and now I’m the bad guy.

1qixrlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/1qixrlw/coffee_and_inflammation_good_or_bad/,Coffee and inflammation — good or bad?,"I see this question come up a lot, and honestly… the answer is it depends on the person.

Some studies suggest coffee has antioxidants and *can* reduce inflammation for some people. But in real life, many people notice that coffee:

* Triggers acid reflux or stomach pain
* Worsens anxiety or stress (which increases inflammation)
* Causes bloating or gut irritation
* Makes joint pain or headaches worse
* Disrupts sleep (which is huge for inflammation)

On the other hand, some people tolerate it perfectly fine and even feel better with it.

So coffee isn’t “good” or “bad” by default — it’s context + your body.

One mistake I personally made was focusing only on *food* and ignoring *drinks*. It turned out that what I was drinking every day was affecting my inflammation more than I expected.

If you’re trying to reduce inflammation and still not seeing results, it might be worth looking at all drinks, not just coffee.

I found this article useful because it breaks down different drinks and how they affect inflammation (not just coffee):  
[https://medium.com/](https://medium.com/@Digit_By_Oliva/what-drinks-reduce-inflammation-find-out-in-our-free-pdf-f0aa03e064f7)

It helped me realize that some “healthy” drinks were actually making things worse for me.

Curious:  
Have you noticed coffee making your symptoms better or worse? Or no difference at all?

1qixqvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1qixqvu/how_to_structure_sonarr_arr_stack_to_minimize_hdd/,How to structure Sonarr (*arr stack) to minimize HDD noise?,"Sorry, this is kind of a loosely organized stream of consciousness. I have a couple thoughts and because of coffee I am having trouble fully organizing them.

The Issue/Goal:

* My home NAS was 95% a media server stack and it was very noisy due to downloads churning quite often.
   * This wasn't an issue when I lived in a larger place with a home office.
* My goal is to minimize noise from HDDs in my NAS while I am awake (my apartment is very small).
   * This is probably a more niche issue but I wanted to see if it has been solved/considered before I try to do something custom.

Notes:

* For these ideas assume there are two volumes:
   * The first is an SSD drive pool (maybe 4TB) that has the whole \*arr stack and acts as a scratch disk/download location.
   * The second is a massive HDD drive pool for the bulk of the media files.
* Apologies if some of this is obvious by looking at the ui/settings. I don't have a working instance at the moment (had to sell my NAS before I moved) so i am working from memory and the sonarr docs.
* The more I think about it all, at least some of this is probably outside of what Sonarr is meant to do so when I say ""Sonarr"" assume I mean ""Sonarr or other parts of the \*arr ecosystem/stack"".

Questions/Ideas:

1. ~~Can you schedule when different parts of the queue in Sonarr are processed?~~
   * ~~For example, if I want imports to be processed immediately but only want file copy/move operations to be done between 2-6am?~~
2. ~~Once a download is finished, Sonarr creates a hardlink between the downloaded file and its location in the media directory until the seeding is finished. Can it be structured such that the media directory and the download directory are on the SSD but the media files are copied to the HDD pool once seeding is finished. Lastly Sonarr updates the hardlink to point at the file in the HDD pool while keeping all of the metadata and smaller files on the SSD?~~
   * ~~So the flow would look something like this:~~ [~~https://imgur.com/a/kN1JvIk~~](https://imgur.com/a/kN1JvIk)
   * ~~Files should stay on the SSD long enough to watch the first time while the file seeds.~~
   * ~~Assuming you can schedule the queue (see #1) we could get updates to the media server as fast as possible and handle archiving/migrating to the HDD when people are asleep.~~
3. ~~Is there a way to feed two media libraries with different priorities to Jellyfin/etc?~~
   * ~~Say the SSD pool is P0 and the HDD pool is P1; If a show's episode 1 is found on both it will prioritize the one on the SSD and fall back to the HDD if its not found on the SSD.~~
4. I saw another post for [Episeer](https://github.com/Vansmak/episeerr) which is a great idea but its goal is to prioritize drive space.  Does anyone know of a server/plugin that does something similar but instead of downloading/deleting it adds/removes episodes from the cache?

* For anyone unaware, Episeer keeps track of what shows you're watching and downloads only the next few episodes and deletes old ones as you watch. The ideas is to only ever have as many episodes as you actually will watch on your machine.

Thank you for reading my TED talk, I've been thinking about how to solve this problem (I hope it came across properly) for a hot minute and am not sure if its really doable with whats currently available.

Anyone have any ideas? Let me know if anything is confusing.

  
Edit:

Thanks to everyone who commented. Sounds like most of the stuff can be fixed by using Unraid on my NAS. Will give it a shot when I can. :)",2,1769001746.0,sonarr,17,1.0,False
1qixqfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1qixqfg/am_i_entitled_to_compensation/,Am I entitled to compensation?,"Hi, I am posting to see if based on the details mentioned below j would be entitled to any compensation at all? I would really appreciate any advice at all. Thank you all 💗

I was on a flight from LHR (London, UK) to IGI (Delhi, India) which is about a 10-10.5 hour flight. I will summarize some of the info below so it is an easier read:

\- this was on 14 Dec 2025, night flight 

\- boarding delayed at LHR by 30 min 

\- flight estimated to be delayed by 40 min

\- landed at Delhi airport at 11:55am (IST)

\- made to wait in aircraft till 16:20pm (IST)

\- in aircraft for almost 4.5 hours 

\- wait was due to smog in Delhi and nowhere for the aircraft to park 

\- told by pilot we will deplane multiple times yet we did not 

\- no refreshments, snacks or even water passed around 

\- chaos in the aircraft (people missing connecting flights, elderly and sick people not having their medication or water to take medication with, etc)

\- flight attendant yelling at passenger and speaking rudely to them upon asking for water and updates 

\- took 1.5 hour to get water for an elderly passenger near me 

\- not allowed to use bathroom for first 1.5 hour after landing

\- WiFi shut off for the duration of being landed but in flight (they had free WiFi on board)

\- in an aircraft so obviously a lot of passengers including myself had no signal for the 4.5 hours we were there to contact anyone 

Anyways, I raised a complaint for compensation to air india mentioning all of the above. They have asked for flight details which I provided (although id already sent this in my initial message). They have now replied to me after over a month with this email below:

We completely understand the concern, we would like to begin by extending our heartfelt empathy for the discomfort experienced. 

Please be advised that despite our continuous efforts to operate all flights punctually, unforeseen circumstances may occasionally lead to last‑minute cancellations, delays, or disruptions. In this instance, the schedule of flight AI2018 from London to Mumbai was impacted due to operational reasons, including air traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, and airfield congestion. These factors resulted in a delay in the allocation of the parking bay, and the flight was held on the runway by officials until clearance was provided. Additionally, the schedule of the return flight AI111 from Delhi to London was also affected due to operational requirements.

While we completely understand the discomfort caused, we would like to share that during the prolonged ground holding period, the Captain made regular announcements to keep passengers informed of the situation. Considering the extended duration after landing, passengers were permitted to use the lavatories to ensure comfort. The onboard crew continuously monitored the cabin, maintained calm communication, and extended all possible assistance. Water bottles, tea/coffee, and cookies were distributed repeatedly as per availability; however, due to the extended delay of nearly four hours post‑landing, onboard stock was eventually limited which resulted into to delayed service.

Your feedback regarding the inflight cabin service, airport services is invaluable to us, as it helps us identify areas for improvement and take corrective measures to ensure a better experience for our guests in the future. We are committed to addressing the concerns you encountered and would like to assure you that immediate steps are being taken to strengthen our service delivery.

We strive to uphold the highest standards of service and adhere to all applicable regulations, including those set forth by the authorities. As per the regulations, compensation/reimbursement is inapplicable in cases where the delay is deemed to be beyond the control of the airline and falls within certain parameters specified by the authority. While we understand the concern and frustration that flight delays can cause however, we are unable to honor the request for compensation.

We hope for the opportunity to serve you again in the future. Your satisfaction remains our utmost priority, and we aim to regain your trust in Air India.

Please feel free to contact us in case any further assistance is required.

Am I able to claim any compensation at all for this or should I just let it go? I did pay £1K for this flight so I’m annoyed by the experience and how they handled it. To add, my flight back was delayed by an hour from departure at 06:15 to 07:30am as well.",0,1769001714.0,Flights,19,0.17,False

Beans
Gluten
All legumes related to beans
Yeast
Soy
Most forms of protein
All grains and oats
Seaweed
Most gums
Nervous about cruciferous vegetables causing thyroid damage or kidney stones if relying on them too heavily.

Has done fruitarianism for years but it is hard financially and a struggle with satiety and caloric/ protein expectations. 

Need advice. 

This is what is currently being consumed:

Breakfast: hot vegetable broth. A slice of buckwheat toast thats only ingredients are buckwheat and salt. Toasted w some form of plant oil on the stove. Fruit preserves on the toast. 

This meal is high satiety but calorically inept. 

Lunch: coconout cream in a tea with preserves and sweetener. 

Struggling with feeling physically distended and uncomfortable throughout the day from the buckwheat. I'm really hoping this isn't an allergy. I don't know if it's nornal to be physically uncomfortable most of the day from eating a single 6cm slice of buckwheat toast. 

Often skipping lunch because it feels uncomfortable to eat. 

Supper: grilled vegetables. Usually cabbage plus either red peppers. Carrots, or turnips. Have been told nightshades are equally bad for inflammation and to avoid them though by doctors. Lately been enjoying watermelon radish and it's the only food thoroughly enjoyed other than breakfast vegetable broths or mushroom soups and foor preserves

Has tried eating it over rice or quinoa but has digestional issues w all grains. Has resorted to either eating them by themselves or over a small bed of kale or chard.

Tea: often is replacing with coffee, tea, or flavoured waters for the illusion of food. Food is causing a lot of discomfort. Doctors have been conferred w but outside of an autoimmune disease that is being medicated there is no available help to make food more comfortable or to have less allergies.

Dinner: is craving sandwiches or burritos. Not because of the foods but because of the sensory stimuli of having a convenient format for eating a clean bite out of food that doesn't rely on instrumentation of forks and knives and spoons. Generally doesn't like eating with their hands but has aspergers and adhd and says food doesn't feel like a solid meal withour having something substantial to grab onto and take a bite out of at some point of the day. Feels excluded from social expectations of how to enact with food. We have tried lettuce wraps and a wide variety of other leaves but they can not handle the wet nature of touching leaves. Texture paralysis is a big problem. 

Vocalizes missing crunchy foods. Used to eat carrots and celery and radishes and jicama/kohlrabi for dinner often but washing the vegetables can be triggering and has fallen out with the habit due to the sensory overload of touching wet items. 

Is currently experiencing a lot of stress about textures in apples, racing to finish fruits before they expire and then not having fruits while waiting for fruits to ripen. Has stopped purchasing fruit due to the ripening paradox. 

Need advice how to form a vegan meal plan that they can actually follow. They don't want to be struggling this much with food, but I know I cannot argue against veganism because it is their ethos and moral code. I do not want to undermine their ethos. I do need help from other vegans who suffer w similar concerns or allergies to come up w how to tackle this. ",2,1769001703.0,vegan,3,0.67,False

I don’t really make resolutions, but I have currently been sticking with it and I’m getting a lot less migraines.

My migraines are always in the same spot. Right temple, behind the eye, back of neck and into my shoulder blade. I think it comes from an old sports injury where I have torn, strained my shoulder on a couple of occasions.  Never, ever in the history of having migraines have I had a headache on the left side of my head. I would normally get intense bursts for a couple of hours, maybe 5 times a week.

  
Back to the coffee. I was never an addict. I didn’t need a coffee to function throughout the day but would only really have them at work (they are free) and come in a bean to cup machine. One sugar and one sweetener. Since stopping I think I have had maybe 2 outbursts since. I thought I had cracked it, but after searching the word coffee on this sub it seems most people are using coffee to combat migraines?? I’m currently now just on a couple of tea’s per day.

We’re wired to strive. To achieve the goal, land the job, impress the room, win the argument, be liked, be chosen. Somewhere deep in our bones there’s a small, persistent voice that says, Try harder. Push more. Don’t let this slip away. Believe me, I know— I'm the ""Pushing on Pull Doors"" poster child.

And most of the time, that instinct serves us well. It’s how things get built, learned, written, raised, and repaired.

But not always.

Sometimes we want something so badly that we forget to ask whether it actually wants us back. We push on a door that won’t budge, convinced that if we just lean harder—or knock louder, or explain ourselves one more time—it will eventually open. Meanwhile, we’re bruising our shoulder and muttering under our breath while pretending this is character building.

There’s that old saying, ""When one door closes, another door opens"". Which is comforting, but a bit vague when you’re standing in the hallway holding your résumé, your pride, or your carefully laid plans. What I’ve learned, very slowly and with considerable reluctance, is that sometimes the closed door wasn’t the right door in the first place. It wasn’t a tragic loss. It was a quiet mercy.

Not every job is meant to be kept. Not every person is meant to be in your life. Not every opportunity that shines is actually meant for us, our values, or our peace of mind. Occasionally, what feels like rejection is simply redirection—often to something better.

With time, distance, and a decent cup of coffee, you can usually look back and see it clearly. Oh, I really dodged a bullet there. That worked out for the best, after all! 

We don’t talk enough about the fine art of letting go. And trusting that we don’t have to force every outcome to prove our worth.

I'm doing OK with my ZP6 special (at setting 4.5) using DAK's own recipe (below) and their Cream Donut, I get nice ""confectionery"" tastes.

I do a gentle pour with the Brewista spout low to the V60 Ceramic (02, Hario tabbed Japanese paper, in a green logo soft pack).

* Ratio: 1:18 (e.g., 15g in, 270g out)
* Temperature: 98°C
* Bloom: 75g of water for 1 minute
* First pour: to 170g
* Second pour (once bed is visible): up to 270g
* Total brew time: (DAK recommend 3:30, mine's more like 2:40-3:00)

That recipe and the ZP6 worked great for the Cream Donut 30 days off roast, but not for the Milky Cake 30 days off roast, which was way too thin

I read here that the DAK Milky Cake beans need a lot of extraction, given that I'm now down to a finer grind at 3.5 on the ZP6 and stirring the bloom (a la ScottRao) plus a more aggressive pour with a Rao spin at the end.  
The cup still loses a bit of needed bitterness (for balance) as it cools, when it can even go towards sour, I think. I wonder if a less uniform grind might help. Of course I'll experiment with pours first. & maybe a shorter bloom with less volume

Hand Grinders:

I'm thinking of when I took advice here and bought the ZP6 and I learned that it's pretty clarity-focussed, very uniform tool, so I'm wondering whether a K-Ultra with it's slightly less uniform grind might suit coffees like the Milky Cake better.

As an aside, I don't need an espresso grind as there is no way I'm buying a machine if I want to hold onto my darling wife.  
\- although I MIGHT experiment with OXO Rapid Brewer for soup shots down the line - wonder if that might suit DAK beans?

I don't know her and probably wouldn't agree totally with her on some things because of her controversies BUT we feel the same pain. On the way from dermatologist I thought of Virginia Woolf's diary. I love diaries. Now on this site I got love from but also saw so much hate, Reddit, someone said how they're just giving up on making friends (since its according to te post hard to do in Germany since Germans are private people according to them) and they're focusing on themselves and talking with themselves thru diary. Thats a god point and I love that being an artist eventho a curse currently makes suffering a inspiration to wirte and especially books. 

What am I insane about? I want to let it out. I hate being a man, we are so cruel, so limited, so primal. I mean the whole world is like that but at least women have their freedom, they stand for freedom, diversity, sensibilisity and beauty in the world. They don't like us either actually. Even straight women are into other women - ""women are just more beautiful, sensual, ellegant"". So we men are disgusting beings - we are rapists, murderers, the ones with closed mindset, just roughness and hate - women hate us and we hate other men. Women stand for freedom, art, empathy, creation, care for humans, animals, planet, beauty, sensuality, fluidity,  - all things I find beautiful and which actually matter and make sence out of this existance. If I do these things do you think I can really be celebrated? I mean yeah women in my life loved me and some boys too but... I have a feeling in mainstream narrative, these beautiful things can not belong to me because I am a man. I always found my bisexuality (eventho I am leaning towards women in relationships) to be something great until I got on Reddit. This Reddit. Social media fucked me up. Something that gave a 11yo me a platform tro meet the world now destroys my world and the world in general because of this dumb polarisation and dumbification of people as we werent dumb enough. I hate the left and the right for this. Heidi Reinichek (germaqn leftist politician) saying how ""the problem are men"" and there comes the neo-nazi bullshit from AfD taking those hurt men but only under the condition that they turn into those toxic men. Being masculine basically means being an emotionless ruthless all-capable killer robot. Me standing for those beautfiul things that  mentioned makes me feminine and feminine is bad and pathetic, but at least a woman can be feminine a man can't. I love that we have broaden femininity, oh my you can be a woman in sooo many ways and this is beautfiul, but a man? Masculinity is more fragile that a wine glass. Everything you do as a man is gay. I have a feeling I can't have a personality without getting those accusations. This is sad. And women when they're struggling at least have a whole community to support them. As I was on a site of my University's Counceling support they had an extra ""women therapy"" but no extra ""men's therapy"" eventho men are 3/4 of all suicides. Why can't we be equal? I willnot give up on my self I promised myself that I will give myself a chance to live this year after everything I fought the last years but if it doesn't get better after EVERYTHING I am trying, I am going to end myself in 2027.

Ofc it isn't all black and white eventho my anxiety makes me think that, there is a ""Men therapy"" by Caritas and ofc we talk about men issues but not in the way I would like it to be. Let's see what happens, I will just chill in this era of me, enjoy sensations like my morning coffee, organic food I bought for cheap, some experimental music maybe and ofc some books and games omg I love games they are saving me, the only thing that never bothers me.",0,1769001298.0,venting,3,0.5,False

Hes not a big fan of ""roommate rules"", but he's also not super great at communicating at times and can be really defensive, hence this post. Now we have a lot of houseplants. A LOT of houseplants. Some he has bought, some have been gifts to us both, and a lot I've bought, but I do the vast majority of the plant care and at this point i dont know what plants belong to either of us anymore. I buy the majority of plant supplies as well. He helps water them here and there and has been more helpful recently with house care in general, but him doing so is a result of many long arguments about chore charts and mental load on my end. Me saying this is only for back story as to why im coming to reddit at all, he tries in his own way and I try to acknowledge and appreciate his efforts as much as possible.

 Now to the incident. Tonight I came home from work to a clean house, dinner, and many of the plants completely rearranged or some gone altogether. I was taken aback but said I appreciated him cleaning up and thanked him for his hard work. I did however make some comments about having to move some of them back, different plants need different things and if the coffee plant is in direct sunlight its gonna die, yk? He took that personally and said i never appreciate what he does or tell him good job (immediately after I thanked him and told him good job). 
Now we've done this song and dance before, he's rearranged the plants, I've moved them back and asked if we could talk about it first, since they're ""ours"", and he gets pissed off and doesnt talk to me for a day or two. He also said that our kitten, gigi, broke one of my favorite monsteras' fronds. Which upon further inspection, definitely wasn't her. She doesn't get into those plants because i scent trained her at a young age to avoid them, and it was the top frond but the rest were fine? The moss poles i had just put in to root were all untied as well. 
I dont know why, but discovering that he probably broke it made me burst into tears. Im feeling really upset and like he doesnt respect me or my efforts. Ive put a lot of time and money and care into these plants, they're important to me, and he didnt even consult me about changing anything or getting rid of any of them, after we've had this discussion before. He's also gotten mad at me for not talking to him before I trimmed a plant, which makes me even more upset because its such a double standard.
 I want to bring it up, say we should split up the plants amicably so he can do whatever he wants with his, but i fear it will just result in a conflict with no resolution and him going back to not helping as much around the house. Hes a ""oh so youre bring this up?? I guess I'll just never touch it again"" type person and its always been a frustration for me when trying to talk out disagreements. But I dont feel like the solution to not arguing is just me biting my tongue all the time in fear he will react angrily or be petty. Help ",1,1769001227.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.67,False

The thing about living alone is you learn exactly where everything goes.

I don't mean that in a neat freak way. I'm not one of those guys who alphabetizes his spice rack or whatever. But after three years in the same apartment, you just know. The remote control lives on the left arm of the couch because I'm right handed and that's where my hand drops it. The bath towel hangs with the tag facing the wall because I grab it from the shower and that's how it lands. You don't think about this stuff. Your body does it for you, same way you don't think about breathing.

So when the remote was on the right arm of the couch, I noticed.

Not right away. I came home from work, kicked off my shoes, grabbed a beer from the fridge. Sat down to watch the news. Reached for the remote and it wasn't there. Looked to my right and there it was, sitting perfectly centered on the arm rest like somebody had placed it there with thought.

I remember thinking: Did I do that?

You ask yourself that question enough times, you stop trusting the answer.

This was back in October. October ninth, specifically, because I started keeping track after a while and I went back and figured out when it began. That Wednesday was the remote. Thursday, nothing that I noticed. Friday, my toothbrush was in the holder bristles down instead of up. Could have been me. I was tired that morning. Running late. Maybe I just dropped it in there wrong.

Saturday, the soap in the shower was turned around. The Dove bar. I always keep the logo facing out because. Well, there's no because. That's just how I set it down. And that morning it was facing the wall.

I stood there in the shower for probably five minutes just staring at that soap like it was going to explain itself to me.

Here's what I told myself: You're being crazy. You're turning into one of those people. Paranoid. Seeing patterns in nothing. The remote got moved because you were drunk, you don't remember. The toothbrush, the soap, who the hell pays attention to that stuff? Only a crazy person. Only someone looking for something to worry about.

I believed that for almost two weeks.

The thing that changed my mind was the chair.

I have this little wooden chair in my bedroom. Came with the apartment, actually. The previous tenant left it and I never bothered to get rid of it. It sits in the corner by the window and I throw clothes on it. That's its whole purpose. Clothes chair. Everyone has one.

So I'm getting ready for bed on a Tuesday night. October twenty second. I remember because that was the night I started writing things down. I'm getting ready for bed and I look at the chair and it's not in the corner anymore. It's about two feet out from the wall, angled toward the bed.

Toward where I sleep.

The clothes I'd thrown on it were still there. Same wrinkled shirt, same jeans. But the chair had moved.

I checked the windows. Locked. Checked the front door. Locked, deadbolt thrown, chain on. Checked the closets, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Nobody. Nothing. I even looked in the kitchen cabinets, the ones big enough for a person to fit inside. Empty except for pots and pans I never use.

Nobody was there. Nobody had been there.

Except somebody had, because chairs don't move themselves.

I didn't sleep that night. I sat on the couch with all the lights on and a kitchen knife on the cushion beside me, waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. The sun came up. I went to work. I came home. The chair was back in the corner.

I want you to understand what that felt like. The chair being back was worse than the chair being moved. Because it meant that whoever did this, they knew I had noticed. They knew, and they had put it back, and they wanted me to know they had put it back. Like a message. Like a little wave hello.

Or maybe I moved it back myself and forgot. Maybe I was sleepwalking. Maybe this was all in my head, some kind of breakdown, stress from work or loneliness or whatever.

I bought a camera. One of those Wyze cameras, sixty bucks on Amazon. Set it up on my bookshelf pointed at the front door. I could check the feed from my phone at work. All day long, every fifteen minutes or so, I'd pull up the app and look at my empty apartment. Door closed. Nobody coming or going.

For three days, nothing.

Then I came home on a Friday and the camera was pointing at the ceiling.

Same spot on the bookshelf. Same angle of tilt. But instead of showing my front door, it showed a rectangle of off white plaster. Somebody had tilted it up. Somebody had been in my apartment, seen the camera, and instead of taking it or destroying it, they just. Tilted it. Just enough so I'd know.

I downloaded the footage. The whole day, eight hours of my empty living room. I scrubbed through it looking for the moment someone walked in.

Nobody walked in. The door never opened.

But at 2:47 PM, there's movement at the right edge of the frame. Just a blur. A shape passing behind the camera, coming from the direction of my bedroom. Then a hand reaches into frame from below, tilts the camera up, and that's it. Ceiling for the rest of the day.

I watched that hand about forty times. Pale. Long fingers. No rings, no scars, nothing distinctive. Just a hand, reaching from somewhere behind where I was standing when I set up the camera. From inside the apartment.

They didn't come in through the door. They were already here. They'd been here the whole time I was at work, waiting in my bedroom or my closet or somewhere I hadn't thought to look, and when they were ready they walked right past the camera and tilted it up and left.

Or maybe they didn't leave. Maybe they just went back to wherever they'd been hiding.

I tore the apartment apart that night. Checked every closet, every cabinet, the space under the bed, the gap behind the refrigerator. Nothing. No one. But the footage was real. I watched it again and again. That hand was real. Whoever it belonged to had been standing ten feet from where I sleep.

I called the police. A woman came out the next morning, looked around, asked me if anything was missing or damaged. I said no. She asked if I had any enemies, anyone who might want to scare me. I said no. She looked at me the way people look at you when they think you're wasting their time but they're too polite to say so. She said I could file a report but there wasn't much they could do without evidence of a crime. Trespassing, she said, but I'd need proof someone had actually been inside.

I showed her the camera footage. The hand reaching into frame.

She watched it twice. Asked me if I lived alone. I said yes. She asked if anyone else had a key. I said no. She said she'd file a report and someone would be in touch. She said to call if anything else happened.

After she left I sat on the couch for a long time not doing anything. Just sitting there. Thinking about that hand. Where it came from. Where it went. How someone could be inside my apartment for eight hours while I was at work, hiding in a space I couldn't find, waiting for the right moment to tilt my camera and disappear again.

How many times had someone stood in my bathroom, touched my things, breathed my air, and I had no idea? How many nights had I slept ten feet away from.

From what? From who?

I almost moved out. I want to be clear about that. I was ready to break my lease, eat the penalty, find a new place across town or in a different city altogether. I had the Zillow app open on my phone. I was looking at apartments in Denver, in Austin, anywhere but here.

But then I thought: What if they follow me? What if this isn't about the apartment at all? What if it's about me?

And if that's true, then moving won't help. Running won't help. I'd just be carrying whatever this is with me into a new place, a new life, waking up one morning to find the soap turned around and knowing it had started again.

So I stayed. I bought more cameras. Four of them, different brands, pointed at every door and window. I put one in my bedroom, one in the bathroom. I changed my locks. I added a second deadbolt. I started leaving little traps. A hair taped across the door frame. A specific arrangement of items on my kitchen counter that I photographed every morning before work. Three pennies in a triangle. A coffee mug with the handle at exactly two o'clock. A folded dish towel with the corner touching the edge of the sink.

I numbered everything. I documented it. I became obsessed with the small details of my own life in a way I had never been before.

For two weeks, nothing.

The hair stayed intact. The pennies stayed in their triangle. The coffee mug handle stayed at two o'clock.

I started to relax. Started to think maybe I had scared them off. Maybe the cameras, the locks, maybe that was enough. I stopped checking the feeds so obsessively. I let myself sleep through the night without jerking awake at every creak. I even had a beer on a Friday night. Watched a movie. Felt almost normal.

And then I found the box.

I need to explain my closet. It's a small walk in, maybe five feet deep. I keep my clothes on the left side and on the right there's some shelving where I store things I don't use very often. Old tax documents, winter coats, a shoebox full of photos from before I moved.

Behind the shelves, shoved into the back corner, there's a space I never really looked at. The closet isn't very well lit and the shelves block most of it. I knew the space was there but I never thought about it. You don't think about empty spaces in your own home. They're just. There.

I was looking for my heavy coat because it had finally gotten cold. Late November by this point. I pulled out the coat and knocked one of the shoeboxes off the shelf. It fell behind the shelving unit into that back corner. I had to get down on my hands and knees with my phone flashlight to find it.

That's when I saw the box.

Not my shoebox. A different box. Cardboard, about the size of a bread loaf, tucked into the corner like it belonged there. Like it had always been there.

I pulled it out. My hands were shaking. I remember that. I remember how my hands wouldn't stay still.

Inside the box were notebooks. Five of them. Spiral bound, college ruled. The kind you buy at Staples for three dollars.

I opened the first one.

It was dated. The first entry was March fifteenth, 2019. The day I moved into this apartment. The handwriting was small and precise, each letter formed with care. It said:

*New tenant moves in today. Male, early 30s, lives alone. Works regular hours, leaves by 8, home by 6. I will introduce myself tomorrow.*

They started watching me on day one. Before I'd unpacked. Before I'd slept a single night here. They were already waiting.

That was all. One paragraph. I turned the page.

*March 16. He didn't notice me. Good.*

The next page.

*March 17. He sleeps on his back. Snores a little. Breathes through his mouth.*

The next page.

*March 18. He showers in the morning, not at night. Uses Dove soap. Irish Spring shampoo. Doesn't sing. Doesn't talk to himself.*

I read the whole notebook. Then the second one. Then the third. Four hours, sitting on my closet floor with my back against the wall, reading about myself. Reading about every single thing I had done in this apartment for two years. What I ate. What I watched on television. What I said on phone calls to my mother, to my friends, to my boss. How I slept. What position I slept in. When I rolled over. When I got up to use the bathroom at 3 AM.

They had been here. In my apartment. While I was sleeping. Standing over my bed, watching me breathe. For two years.

The notebooks didn't say who they were. Didn't say why. There were no names, no identifying information, nothing that would tell me anything about the person holding the pen. Just observation after observation after observation, written in that same neat handwriting. Clinical. Patient. Like a scientist documenting an animal in a habitat.

The last entry in the fifth notebook was dated three days ago. It said:

*He found the cameras. He'll find the notebooks soon. I am prepared.*

That was all. Nothing about what prepared meant. Nothing about what came next.

Some of the entries were worse than others. Some of them I can't get out of my head.

*December 25, 2019. Christmas. He called his mother at 10 AM. She asked if he was eating enough. He lied and said yes. He had a frozen pizza for dinner. I brought him cookies. Sugar cookies with red and green sprinkles. I left them on the counter while he was in the shower. He found them and looked confused. He ate two. He threw the rest away. I don't think he knew what to make of them. I don't think he remembers.*

I don't remember cookies. Christmas 2019. I don't remember any of that. But I remember being confused that week. I remember feeling like I was forgetting things. I blamed it on the holidays. On being tired.

*January 8, 2020. He had a woman over tonight. First time since I started watching. Her name is Sarah. They met on an app. They had wine. They went to bed. I stayed in the closet. It was uncomfortable but necessary. She left at 6 AM. He seemed happy. I was proud of him.*

Sarah. I remember Sarah. We went out three or four times before it fizzled. She said I was too distracted. Too in my own head. She said it felt like I was always looking over my shoulder.

I was. I just didn't know why.

*March 2, 2020. He's sick. Flu or a cold. Stayed home from work. I made him soup. Left it on the stove. He found it and looked confused again. He tasted it. He ate the whole pot. I was glad. He needs someone to take care of him.*

I remember that soup. Chicken noodle. I remember finding it and thinking: Did I make this? Did I start cooking something and forget? I was feverish. I figured I must have done it in a daze. I remember thinking it was good soup. Better than anything I usually make.

They were there. In my kitchen. Cooking for me. While I was sick in bed ten feet away.

I took the notebooks to the police. Different officer this time, a man with a mustache who frowned a lot and made notes in his own notebook. He read some of the entries. His frown got deeper. He asked me if this was a joke. I said no. He asked me if I had written these notebooks myself as some kind of. I don't know. Cry for help. I said no. He said they would look into it. He gave me his card. He said to call if anything else happened.

I asked him what I was supposed to do in the meantime.

He didn't have an answer.

I keep the notebooks now. I read them sometimes. Not all of them, not in order, but I'll open one at random and read an entry. Just to remind myself that it's real. That I'm not crazy. That someone was really here, in my home, watching me.

*April 4, 2019. He talks in his sleep. Says the word ""no"" a lot. Says ""don't."" Doesn't seem to be nightmares. Just mumbling.*

I don't remember dreaming.

*July 22, 2019. He cut himself shaving today. Small nick on his chin. He didn't notice until he got to work. I could see the tissue fibers stuck to the dried blood when he came home.*

They were that close. Close enough to see tissue fibers.

*November 3, 2019. He cried tonight. I don't know why. He sat on the couch and cried for about twenty minutes and then he stopped and watched television. He seems lonely. I understand.*

I remember that night. I don't remember why I was crying. Something small. Something that felt big at the time.

*February 14, 2020. Valentine's Day. He stayed home. Ordered pizza. Watched a movie alone. I sat with him for the last hour. He didn't know.*

Sat with me. What does that mean. Where were they sitting. How close.

*August 9, 2020. He's getting used to me now. Even when I move things, he doesn't notice. He's adjusting. Learning to ignore the signs. This is good. This is progress.*

I threw up after I read that one. Right there on the closet floor. Because I thought back and I couldn't remember anything strange happening in August of 2020. Nothing out of place. Nothing moved. Which meant they were right. I had adjusted. I had learned to ignore it.

How many times did I walk past them in my own hallway? How many times did I almost see them and my brain just. Edited them out. Because they had trained me not to look.

I still live here.

I know that sounds crazy. I know you're thinking: Just move. Just leave. Get out of that apartment and never go back.

But here's the thing. I know they're real now. I have the notebooks. I have proof. And if I leave, I lose that. I go somewhere new and I start wondering again. Was the soap always facing that way? Did I leave the remote there? Am I just paranoid? Am I crazy?

At least here I know. At least here I can be certain.

The police never called back. I tried the number on the card twice and it went to voicemail both times. I stopped trying after that. What were they going to do? Stake out my apartment? Dust for fingerprints? Whoever this is, they're careful. They've been doing this for years. They're not going to get caught because I filled out a report.

So I live with it.

I check the cameras every morning, every night. I photograph my things. I leave the traps. Sometimes they're disturbed. Sometimes they're not. I don't know what that means. I don't know if they're still coming or if they stopped or if they're just better at hiding now.

I don't know anything.

But I know they were here. I know they watched me sleep. I know they sat with me on Valentine's Day, close enough to touch, and I never knew.

Sometimes I talk to them. Out loud, in my empty apartment. I say: I know you're there. I say: What do you want? I say: Please just tell me why.

Nobody answers. But I think they hear me. I think they're listening.

The last notebook had pages left. Empty pages, after that final entry about being prepared. I've been checking those pages every day, looking for new entries.

Last week I found one. Fresh ink, same handwriting.

*He's getting used to me again.*

There was something else on that page. Below the entry. A small drawing, done in the same pen. A sleeping face. My face. Eyes closed, mouth slightly open, head turned to the left on the pillow.

But here's the thing. When I sleep, I can't see myself. I don't know what angle my head tilts or how my mouth falls open. I've never taken a picture. I've never filmed myself sleeping.

The drawing showed me from the right side of the bed. From about two feet away. From the exact spot where someone would be standing if they were leaning over me in the dark.

I studied that drawing for a long time. The proportions were accurate. The shape of my ear was right. There was a small mole on my neck that I'd forgotten I had, rendered perfectly in ballpoint pen.

They were that close. Recently. While I slept.

The page after that drawing was blank. And the page after that. And the page after that. But not the last page.

On the last page, in that same neat handwriting:

*Soon.*

That was three weeks ago. I've checked the notebook every day since. No new entries. Just that word sitting there at the end like a period on a sentence I can't read.

I'm getting better at sleeping through the night now. I hardly ever wake up anymore. The sounds don't bother me. The creaks, the little shifts in the dark. I've learned to let them go. That's the trick, I've realized. You can get used to anything if you just stop fighting it. The human brain is built to adapt. To normalize. To make the unbearable bearable.

Last night I woke up at 3 AM. Just for a second. I thought I felt the mattress dip, the way it does when someone sits on the edge of the bed. I thought I heard breathing that wasn't mine. Slow and steady, very close.

I didn't open my eyes. I didn't move. I just lay there, breathing slowly, and after a while the feeling went away and I went back to sleep.

It's easier if you don't look.

This morning I woke up and my pillow smelled different. Not bad ",1,1769000912.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1qixf75,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qixf75/my_34f_sister_hurt_herself_in_reaction_to_my_30f/,My (34F) sister hurt herself in reaction to my (30f) pregnancy news,"My sister and I have always been close. Shes only a few years older and we have a lot of younger siblings so we felt like we grew up together. My husband and I recently moved away. We were previously living in the same neighborhood as my sister in NYC for almost 4 years - and we moved about a year and a half ago. 

I’ll preface by saying my sister does struggle with depression/anxiety. I do too. Anyway, I recently found out I was pregnant which me and my partner were super excited by. It’s not the first grandbaby in our family (my younger sister has two kids) but it’s still exciting to us. 

Anyways, I was a little anxious to tell my family about it not because I didn’t think they’d be excited but because I was concerned how my older sister would react. She’s not in the same position of being in a relationship, let alone thinking about having kids. She’d probably like to be, but has also definitely come to terms with the fact that it might not happen and has said she’s ok with that.

Anyways I tell everyone while they’re all together for a dinner we had right around the holidays and everyone is super happy which is great! All is well!

The next morning I’m making myself coffee when my older sister walks in with huge scratches on her face. I ask her what happened. She says she has a nightmare. I know that’s not why. I press her and say come on now. She says she’ll tell me later.

Long story short ultimately I get her to tell me, and it turns out it was a reaction to my pregnancy. She said she was scared she was losing me as a best friend and that I’d become closer with my younger sister. I was sort of unphased by this and not maybe as comforting as she would have liked. 

I was still sympathetic, but I was also anticipating a reaction like this. I told her I’m sorry she felt that way but in recent months I hadn’t felt super close to her. Every time I talked to her she was pretty heavily negative and if I tried to steer her in a positive direction she would shut me down. She wished she had known before everybody else, but I told her I wanted to tell everyone at the same time. I honestly said how I was more concerned at the fact that she would hurt herself as a reaction to news like this and that concerns me. 

All this to say, maybe it would be one thing if this was the first baby in the family, but it’s not. It’s the third, but the reaction with my other sister was completely fine. It’s just because of me and losing me in a way. But I’m sad, because I’m never going to forget that. 

What’s frustrating now is my mom is planning a baby shower four months out and out of all my siblings she’s the one who can’t commit to a date. 

Which is wild because my other sister’s baby shower was planned with maybe 2 months notice and nobody had any issue making that a priority. 

All this to say I’m deeply hurt by this and have explained this to her, but I truly don’t think it’s gotten through to her. I understand that me having a kid wouldn’t be the most exciting thing in the world to her. I would just have wanted her, as someone I feel close to, to have thought about me a little bit more in that moment. 

Anyways I mostly wanted to vent but also wanted to just say, am I missing anything? I feel as though I’ve been very sympathetic towards her and this is one moment where I would expect some support and felt like that was not the case.

TLDR. My sister’s reaction to my pregnancy hurt my feelings (she scratched up her face) and I just wanted to vent a little. ",31,1769000883.0,relationships,18,0.75,False

I wanted to share a simple hack that I have discovered that has actually got me positive responses due to good quality leads being extracted. Hopefully I can help someone. 

I *'steal'* leads from competitors followers list. Here is how I do it.

  
**1.** I find instagram accounts that my target audience would follow. That can be any niche you just have to be creative with it. **Use your brain**. Could be a software, influencer, marketing agency etc etc. 

**2**. I then use an instagram email scraper from Apify or a Telegram bot (no incentive to give more info sorry)

**3**. Download the list as a CSV. Ask AI to delete the leads that don't have email addresses. I normally get 20% emails scraped from the list.

**4**. Upload the list to an email outreach software. I use my own CRM that I vibe coded hehe

**5**. Send emails. Close Deals.

I apologize when someone bumps into me. I apologize for asking questions at work even when it’s literally my job to ask. I apologize for taking up time in conversations like my presence is an inconvenience.

Yesterday I was at a coffee shop and apologized to the barista for ordering. Not for being indecisive or holding up the line, just for placing an order. She looked at me confused and said “you’re good” but I still felt embarrassed.

My therapist pointed out I do this constantly and asked when I started believing I needed permission to take up space. Honest answer, I don’t know. Somewhere along the way I internalized that being visible or having needs was inherently bothersome to others.

I’ve been trying to catch myself but it’s so automatic. I’ll apologize mid-sentence and not even realize I did it until after.

Even dumb stuff like ordering packaging supplies on alibaba for my small business, I found myself over-explaining to the supplier why I needed certain specs like I had to justify my existence as a customer.

Someone complimented my hazel eyes last week and my immediate response was “oh sorry they’re actually more green depending on lighting” like why am I apologizing for a compliment?

Does the hotel need at least one family member to have the shining in order to exert any type or influence (or haunting) over the family?

1qixdxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1qixdxb/how_to_not_hold_grudge/,How to not hold grudge,"Hi there, I'm M(30), recently my life has been a mess in every of its aspects, and the breakup with ex (F25) put the final nail on the coffin. We broke up like last August and I totally lost my mind. Been hospitalised in psychiatric hospital for few months for severe depression and suicidal attempts. During this period and after depressive syndroms were gone, I got diagnosed with both BPD and NPD, with some ASPD traits. Except of BPD, I wasn't very surprised of the diagnosis coz since I'm a child people made me notice that I have some narcissistic and lack of empathy issues.

The fact is after my first suicidal attempt and being transferred to hospital, my ex was pretty aware of my situation, but she decided to cut all link with me and didn't give a fuck about me. We broke up online while she was far away (I initiated the breakup) but we didn't have the opportunity to have a real life last talk. I didn't want more than that. I tried to contact her several times but she always denied me any talking and kept blocking me at all my attempts. She even sent her friends to threaten me on social medias (thing I would have never imagined her doing). I felt despised and abandoned, and I eventually started to split and develop a huge hatred towards her. Harassed her from my phone for months , sent her murder threats and insults, did other crazy things I won't even describe here. I learn in December that she was already dating someone new and it made me even more angry. I wanted to get revenge so bad that now I'm in trouble with justice since she went to see the cops.

What I don't understand is, in first instance, I was never really attracted to her, neither physically or mentally, I noticed we were completely different, she was way ""too healthy"", I was feeling super bored in the relationship. She is smart and successful person in her carrier, she has a really impressing CV, but in her daily life she's super boring to talk with, coz she's shy and silencious, she just likes to go to coffee dates and sometimes museums. The sex was super boring coz she was shy and silencious too. And she was always clingy and didn't like when I wanted to have some time alone. But I thought anyway that I needed some healthy people in my life to improve myself and that I should stick to this relationship. I ofc during the time of our dating period, discarded, had anger outbursts, withdraw and even cheat when she wasn't around (she doesn't know about it). Now I stopped harassing her but not because I feel any remorses or regrets, but because I don't want to face justice. I already protected myself during harassment by using scripted email address, VPNs, fake phone numbers etc. I know for sure I gave her a lot of stress and anxiety. But I feel like it's not enough for what she did to me and told me during and after the breakup. I hold a big grudge against her and it's very tiring. I don't even know why I hold a grudge over someone I was never really in love with and that I started to run away from during the relationship.

Just did this test this morning (took about 20 minutes)... three prompts extending the same scene starting with 1 image:

  
PROMPT 1:

Early evening in a softly lit kitchen, warm amber light spilling in from a single window as dusk settles outside. Ellie stands alone at the counter, barefoot, wearing an oversized sweater, slowly stirring a mug of tea. Steam rises and curls in the air. The camera begins in a tight close-up on her hands circling the spoon, then gently pulls back to reveal her face in profile — thoughtful, tired, but calm. Behind her, slightly out of focus, Danny leans against the doorway, arms crossed, watching her with a familiar half-smile. He shifts his weight casually, the wood floor creaking softly underfoot. The camera subtly drifts to include both of them in frame, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps Ellie sharp while Danny remains just a touch softer. The room hums with quiet domestic sound — a refrigerator buzz, distant traffic outside. Danny exhales a small amused breath and says quietly, “You always stir like you’re trying not to wake someone.” Ellie smiles without turning around.

PROMPT 2:

The camera continues its slow, natural movement, drifting slightly to Ellie’s left as she puts the spoon besides the coffee mug and then holds the mug in both hands, lifts it to her mouth and takes a careful sip. Steam briefly fogs her face, then clears. She exhales, shoulders loosening. Behind her, Danny uncrosses his arms and steps forward just a half pace, stopping in the doorway light. The camera subtly refocuses, bringing Danny into sharper clarity while Ellie remains foregrounded. He tilts his head, studying her, and says gently, “Long day?” Ellie nods, eyes still on the mug, then glances sideways toward him without fully turning her body. The warm kitchen light contrasts with the cooler blue dusk behind Danny, creating a quiet visual divide between them. Ambient room sound continues — the low refrigerator hum, a distant car passing outside.

PROMPT 3:

The camera holds its position as Ellie lowers the mug slightly, still cradling it in both hands. She pauses, considering, then says quietly, almost to herself, “Just… everything today.” Danny doesn’t answer right away. He looks past her toward the window, the blue dusk deepening behind him. The camera drifts a fraction closer, enough to feel the space between them tighten. A refrigerator click breaks the silence. Danny finally nods, a small acknowledgment, and says softly, “Yeah.” Neither of them moves closer. The light continues to warm the kitchen as night settles in.

Read relationship books, watched communication experts, listened to dating podcasts. Turns out most guys overthink this to death.

The real issue? We treat talking to women like some special skill when it's just... talking to humans. Society conditions us to view every interaction as high stakes. Your biology pumps cortisol through your system because evolution wired rejection to feel like social death. None of this means you're broken. But here's what I learned from credible sources that genuinely helped.

Stop treating it like an audition

Women can smell desperation from across the room. When you approach someone thinking ""I need her to like me,"" you've already lost. Dr. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that authenticity creates connection, not performance.

Start conversations with zero agenda. Comment on something in your shared environment. ""This coffee shop has the weirdest art"" works better than any pickup line. You're not trying to impress anyone, you're just talking.

The 3 second rule actually works

Hesitate longer than 3 seconds and your brain manufactures every reason why you'll fail. [Mel Robbins](https://www.melrobbins.com/) talks about this in [The 5 Second Rule](https://www.melrobbins.com/5-second-rule/) (bestselling book, over 2 million copies sold). She's a motivational speaker who broke down the neuroscience of overthinking.

Your prefrontal cortex, the part that catastrophizes, needs time to sabotage you. Don't give it that time. See someone interesting? Move immediately. Doesn't matter what you say initially, movement kills anxiety.

Ask better questions

Most conversations die because people ask boring questions. ""What do you do?"" makes everyone want to leave. Instead, try ""What's occupying most of your headspace lately?"" or ""What's something you're weirdly passionate about?""

[Vanessa Van Edwards](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/) covers this extensively in [Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/captivate/). She runs a human behavior research lab and found that interesting questions create dopamine responses in conversations. This book genuinely changed how I interact with everyone, not just women. The research on nonverbal communication alone is insanely valuable.

Practice with everyone

Talk to the barista. The person in the elevator. Your Uber driver. Getting comfortable with small talk removes the pressure when attraction is involved.

I started using Slowly (it's a pen pal app where you write letters to strangers worldwide). Sounds random but practicing written conversation helped me organize my thoughts better. You learn what makes people respond, what creates genuine interest.

Listen more than you talk

Most people wait for their turn to speak instead of actually listening. When you genuinely pay attention, ask follow up questions, remember details, you become memorable.

[Mark Manson's](https://markmanson.net/) [Models: Attract Women Through Honesty](https://markmanson.net/models) explains this better than anything I've read. He's a bestselling author (sold millions of copies of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck) and his dating advice is refreshingly honest. No manipulation tactics, just authenticity. The section on neediness versus non-neediness completely reframed how I approach relationships.

Your body language matters more than words

According to research from Amy Cuddy (social psychologist at Harvard), your nonverbal communication accounts for over 50% of how people perceive you. Stand up straight. Make eye contact. Don't cross your arms.

The Mindful Relationship Habit podcast with S.J. Scott dives deep into this. He interviews therapists and relationship experts about practical communication skills. Episode on body language and presence is excellent.

Rejection is data, not verdict

Not every woman will want to talk. That's fine. Sometimes timing is off, sometimes there's no chemistry, sometimes she's having a terrible day. None of this reflects your worth.

[Dr. Guy Winch's](https://www.guywinch.com/) [How to Fix a Broken Heart](https://www.guywinch.com/books) helped me reframe rejection. He's a psychologist who studies emotional health and his TED talk has millions of views. The book explains why rejection hurts so much neurologically and provides actual tools to process it healthily.

Get comfortable being uncomfortable

You will say awkward things. You will stumble over words. You will misread situations. Everyone does. The difference between guys who are good at this and guys who aren't? The good ones kept going despite the discomfort.

Social skills are skills. They improve with practice. Nobody is naturally gifted at this, some people just started practicing earlier.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these social and communication skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals.

Type in what you're working on, like improving conversation skills or understanding social dynamics, and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or other sessions without feeling like work.

Real confidence comes from knowing you can handle whatever response you get. That only develops through repetition. Start small, be genuine, stop putting so much pressure on every interaction.

​I’m reaching out with a question that haunts me every time I see Cloudflare’s status page turn anything other than green. Most of us strive for ""enterprise-grade"" setups at home, but let’s be real – how robust is our dependence on one of the internet's biggest gatekeepers?

​I’d love to get your perspective on two things:

​1. Resilience vs. Resignation: What happens when the CDN fails?

How do you handle situations where Cloudflare (whether it’s their CDN, DNS, or Tunnels) hits a snag?

​Do you have an automated failover to a secondary DNS/proxy provider?

​Do you keep a ""break-glass"" VPN for direct local access?

​Or do you just shrug, brew a coffee, and wait for the engineers in San Francisco to fix it because ""if Cloudflare is down, half the internet is down anyway""?

​2. Why Cloudflare? (The ""Why"" behind your stack)

What was the primary driver for implementing it in your lab? Is it:

​Protection: Because you don’t want every script-kiddie knowing your home’s public IP?

​Convenience: Because Argo Tunnels are just plain easier than dealing with port forwarding and manual cert management?

​The ""Cool Factor"": Because you feel your personal Nextcloud instance absolutely needs edge caching in 200+ cities (even if the only users are you and your cat)?

​I’d love to hear about your setups, your disaster recovery (or lack thereof), or even your confessions that your ""high availability"" plan is just crying quietly in the server closet.

I’m sharing this here because r/EntrepreneurRideAlong feels like the right place for honest reflection, not hype.

A few years ago, I didn’t plan to “make it.” I was just solving problems as they came. I was working mostly online, moving between shared office spaces, coffee shops, and home setups, just trying to stay productive and keep my costs low. Somewhere along the line, a few small ideas I worked on started bringing in money. Not huge at first, but steady. Enough to give me breathing room and confidence.

The strange part is that I never built a long-term vision around it. I didn’t think deeply about positioning, moats, or what happens when the environment changes. I assumed I’d always be able to adapt the same way I had before.

Fast forward to now, and the landscape looks completely different. Tools, automation, and AI have flattened a lot of what once felt valuable. Things people used to pay for are now bundled, free, or automated away. Even the way people research has changed. I remember digging through Alibaba listings, forums, and other online shopping mail updates just to understand how people were sourcing products and setting up operations. That kind of slow research felt meaningful then. Now everything feels faster, noisier, and harder to anchor to something solid.

I’m not in crisis financially, but mentally it’s uncomfortable. It feels like my skills didn’t disappear, but the context that rewarded them did. I’m questioning whether to rebuild something new, shift focus entirely, or step back and rethink how value is actually created today.

Has anyone else here experienced accidental success followed by relevance loss? How did you reset your thinking without panicking or forcing the next move?

> **Pricing Note:** Prices listed are estimates based on what I saw during my research in November. They might fluctuate and be much more expensive during Sakura Season.

### 🗼 TOKYO
Tokyo is huge. Accor hotels are mainly located in the Ginza area or nearby. Ginza is **not** a nightlife district. Shops and restaurants close early (around 9:00–10:00 PM). If you want late-night partying, this area is not for you and it would be better to utilise your points elsewhere.

### Budget Options: ibis Styles

#### 1. ibis Styles Tokyo Ginza East
* **Location:** Located in Ginza but in a more secluded area.
* **Est. Price:** ₹18,000 – ₹20,000+ (Peak)
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Rooms:** They have multiple types of rooms available with different bed sizes. The base room comes with a double bed (140cm).
    * **Unique:** Offers ""Tatami"" style rooms which feature Japanese flooring with low beds.
* **Notes:** This hotel is located in a more secluded regions of Ginza, but its newer than the other ibis (or renovated recently) and also has a open terrace and a public hot spring bath. 

#### 2. ibis Styles Tokyo Ginza
* **Location:** Central Ginza (Ginza-7).
* **Est. Price:** ₹12,000 – ₹18,000+ (Peak)
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** Very compact. 14 m² (Standard) to 19 m² (Twin). Primarily Double beds (140cm). Twin rooms exist but are limited.
    * **Amenities:** They have free coffee if you're a Accor member, Microwave and Coin Laundry.
* **Notes:** Better location for shopping than the ""East"" branch, but suffers from the same Ginza issue. Be aware the standard rooms are quite tight (14 m²) and they only have double beds. Pricing is much better than the Ginza East hotel though.

#### 3. ibis Styles Tokyo Bay
* **Location:** Urayasu (Chiba border) - *Not in central Tokyo.*
* **Est. Price:** ₹8,000 – ₹12,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 18 m² (Standard) to 23 m² (Superior).
    * **Bed Config:** Twin beds or Bunk Beds (Quad rooms available for families).
* **Notes:** **Best for Disney Trips.** It is significantly cheaper than central Tokyo. After a tiring day at Disney, it is a huge relief to have a short trip back to the hotel rather than a 45-minute train ride into the city. Although i wouldn't recommend this as your only hotel in Tokyo.

### Mid-Tier Option: Mercure

#### 1. Mercure Tokyo Hibiya
* **Location:** Hibiya/Ginza (Very central, near Shimbashi).
* **Est. Price:** ₹22,000 – ₹32,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 22 m² (Standard/Privilege) to 44 m² (Suite).
    * **Bed Config:** King (180cm) or Twin (2 x 100cm).
    * **Perks:** Privilege rooms often come with free minibar access.
* **Notes:** Closer to the station than the ibis options and has a 7-11 right in front. The ""Free Mini Bar"" in eligible rooms is a nice perk. Its also much more livlier than Ginza hotels.

#### 2. Mercure Tokyo Haneda Airport
* **Location:** Haneda Area (Otorii Station) - *Not inside the terminal.*
* **Est. Price:** ₹8,000 – ₹12,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 24 m² - 25 m².
    * **Bed Config:** King or Twin.
* **Notes:** Best for late night arrivals or very early morning flights. Generally, you can find cheaper non-Accor hotels in the Haneda area if you are just crashing for a night. Only book this if you have much more points to burn. 

### Luxury Option: Pullman

#### 1. Pullman Tokyo Tamachi
* **Location:** Tamachi (Directly connected to Yamanote Line).
* **Est. Price:** ₹35,000 – ₹45,000+
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** Spacious ~29 m² (Deluxe).
    * **Bed Config:** King or Twin.
* **Notes:** Excellent location. It is directly connected to **Tamachi Station** (JR Yamanote Line), making it easy to get anywhere. It is much quieter and less chaotic but nightlife wise remains the same as other Accor Hotels.

---

## 🐙 OSAKA
*Osaka is pretty good as well wrt to Accor Hotels. You can find all kind of options here from Budget to Luxury.*

### Budget Option

#### 1. ibis Osaka Umeda
* **Location:** Umeda (Osaka Station Area).
* **Est. Price:** ₹8,000 – ₹11,000 (Peak)
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 15 m² (Double) to 18 m² (Twin)
    * **Bed Config:** Standard Double or Twin.
* **Notes:** Stairs right next to the hotel go directly into the underground Umeda station network. Convenience store right in front. Walking distance to **Yodobashi Camera** and **Don Quijote**. If you want to save some money and still have a larger sized bed, book a Twin room which is larger and costs the same.
* **Warning:** Umeda Station is a **maze**. It is huge and overwhelming for first-timers. Allow extra time to navigate it on your first day.

### Mid-Tier Option

#### 1. Mercure Tokyu Stay Osaka Namba
* **Location:** Amemura / Shinsaibashi.
* **Est. Price:** ₹12,000 – ₹18,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 21 m² (Standard) to 30 m² (Privilege).
    * **Bed Config:** Queen (160cm) or Twin.
    * **Best Feature:** **In-Room Laundry.** Since it is a ""Tokyu Stay"" collaboration, most rooms have a washer/dryer inside.
* **Notes:** This is a lifesaver for mid-trip laundry. Location is very youthful and active (near the famous ""Glico Man"" sign).

### Luxury Option

#### 1. Swissôtel Nankai Osaka
* **Location:** Namba (Directly above Nankai Station).
* **Est. Price:** ₹25,000 – ₹35,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 22 m² (Advantage) to 32 m² (Select/Grand).
    * **Bed Config:** Queen, King, or Twin.
* **Notes:** The ultimate location for airport access. The hotel sits **on top** of the station. You take the elevator from the Airport Express train directly to the lobby. No dragging bags through the streets.

---

## KYOTO
*Kyoto is about managing crowds and transport.*

### Budget Option

#### 1. ibis Styles Kyoto Station
* **Location:** Kyoto Station (Hachijo / South Exit).
* **Est. Price:** ₹8,000 – ₹14,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 17 m² (Standard).
    * **Bed Config:** Queen (160cm) or Twin.
    * **Facilities:** Coin laundry and microwaves available in common areas.
* **Notes:** Best for Day Trips. Being right at the station makes it easy to take the Shinkansen or JR trains to Nara/Osaka/Hiroshima. Rooms are small but functional.

#### 2. ibis Styles Kyoto Shijo
* **Location:** Shijo/Karasuma (Central Kyoto).
* **Est. Price:** ₹9,000 – ₹12,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 14 m² (Standard) to 19 m² (Superior).
    * **Bed Config:** Single, Double, or Twin.
* **Notes:** Located in a ""nicer"" part of town than the station. Closer to the Gion district and Nishiki market. Be aware standard rooms are tight (14 m²).

### Mid-Tier Option

#### 1. Mercure Kyoto Station
* **Location:** Lower Kyoto (Short walk from station).
* **Est. Price:** ₹20,000 – ₹25,000
* **Rooms & Amenities:**
    * **Room Size:** 23 m² (Superior) to 30 m² (Privilege).
    * **Bed Config:** King or Twin.
    * **Vibe:** Stylish design.
* **Notes:** Very well located with a convenience store nearby. There is a bus stop nearby. Since this stop is *before* the main Kyoto Station terminal (or serves a different route), you can often find empty seats. By the time the bus reaches the next major stop (Kyoto Station), it fills up completely.

---

#### Recommendations & Tips
* Wait for offers that Accor runs and book flexible rates as soon as your dates are confirmed.
* Accor Plus membership can come in handy if you want to have a few days of luxury stays. Specially for Swissotel and Mercure.
* Book Twin rooms wherever possible and the beds are joined as that will give you bigger rooms at almost the same pricing.
* Hotels with Microwave and Laundry can be a life saver specially for long trips and if you're a vegetarian.
* Tokyo -> ibis Styles Tokyo Ginza, Osaka -> ibis Osaka Umeda, Kyoto -> Mercure Kyoto Station or ibis Styles Kyoto Shijo

You’re knee-deep in takeout receipts. Your fridge has salsa, almond milk, and… one lonely lemon. Every Monday, you swear you’ll “start eating better.”

But life gets in the way. Grocery lists feel like puzzles. And those meal plans? Most just assume you're a chef or enjoy chewing air.

That’s why the [MediterraneanPlan .com](https://theworldhealth.org/mediterranean-plan-official) is making waves. It’s structured, clear, and claims to transform your routine in 30 days—with food you might actually enjoy.

Let’s see if it delivers or just dresses up kale and calls it dinner.

# 🧑‍🍳 Nina's Personal Experience ...

Let me tell you about **Nina**, a food stylist I worked with on a shoot for a vegan snack brand. She was burning out from deadlines and relying on coffee and toast.

She found [MediterraneanPlan .com](https://theworldhealth.org/mediterranean-plan-official) at 2 a.m.—which is also when she makes most of her life decisions. But this one stuck.

She followed the **Mediterranean weight loss challenge** part of the plan closely. Her grocery trips were less chaotic thanks to the **printable Mediterranean diet plan shopping list**, and her meals were more colorful than her Instagram feed.

She did mention that the PDFs were scattered. Her solution? She made a Google Drive folder and named it “Operation: Salad.”

What she appreciated most was the **flavor-packed Mediterranean recipes**. They were easy enough for a rushed weekday, yet delicious enough to feel like self-care.

She didn’t treat it like a strict diet—more like a guide that finally respected her time and taste buds.

1qix38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qix38p/you_think_you_need_motivation_heres_how_to_build/,You think you need motivation – here’s how to build habits that don’t care,"We’ve all been there. That burst of motivation after a YouTube video, TikTok reel, or another “you got this” IG post. You feel like you’re gonna change your life. You plan your perfect 5am routine, healthy meals, 3 workout splits. Then a week later, it’s gone. You’re exhausted, inconsistent, and blaming yourself for being “lazy”.

This is the trap so many fall into—confusing *motivation* with *systems*. The truth is, motivation is fleeting. It comes and goes. But habits don’t care how you *feel*. The good news? Building a system that works doesn’t require superpowers. It requires design.

Here’s a collection of the most non-BS, research-backed insights from books, podcasts, and behavioral science that actually work. No fluff, no “just believe in yourself” energy. Just the hard truth and the practical how.

* **Stop relying on willpower. Build default behavior.**
   * Willpower is like a muscle. It gets tired. The American Psychological Association lists decision fatigue as a major cause of failed goals.
   * James Clear’s *Atomic Habits* shows how tiny changes in *environment* beat giant bursts of motivation. Want to read more? Put the book on your pillow. Want to run every morning? Sleep in your workout clothes. Don’t rely on “remembering” or “feeling like it.”
   * BJ Fogg’s *Tiny Habits* approach says start hilariously small. Example: one pushup after brushing your teeth. Once it’s in your cue stack, it grows.
* **Design for friction. Remove the temptation, not just the craving.**
   * The behavioral science center at Stanford suggests that most bad habits fade when the *environment* becomes inconvenient.
   * Don’t want to doomscroll? Log out of your socials every evening. Want to watch less Netflix? Remove autoplay or uninstall from your main device.
   * Nir Eyal, author of *Indistractable*, argues that behaviors become *default* when distractions are designed OUT of your system, not when you try to “focus harder.”
* **Use identity-based habits, not results-based ones.**
   * You don’t want to “lose 10 pounds.” You want to become “a person who doesn’t miss workouts.”
   * A 2018 study from the University of Pennsylvania showed that people persisted longer when actions were tied to identity, not outcome.
   * Tell yourself: “I’m someone who keeps promises to myself.” Even if it’s just 2 minutes a day. Your brain seeks to stay consistent with who you believe you are.
* **Make the reward immediate. Your brain cares about now more than later.**
   * Dopamine isn’t about pleasure, it’s about *anticipation*. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks a lot about this. Motivation spikes when we *expect* a reward, not just when we achieve it.
   * Tie your habit to something fun. Want to write daily? Only let yourself sip your favorite overpriced coffee while writing. Want to study? Use the *temptation bundling* trick from behavioral economist Katy Milkman: pair it with something addictive you already love.
   * Make success instantly satisfying. Cross things off. Log your streaks. Add visual proof of progress.
* **Track the behavior, not the result.**
   * Results lie. Habits build. You don’t control the outcome, only the input.
   * Use habit trackers, or just mark Xs on a wall calendar. The “don’t break the chain” method popularized by Jerry Seinfeld works because it locks your brain into consistency, not perfection.
   * A University College London study found that most habits take *66 days* to become automatic. Not 21. Not 7. Two months of doing it even when you don’t feel it.

*Bonus myths that need to die:*

* Motivation is **not** the problem. *Design* is.
* You don’t need to “feel like it.” You need to *show up small, consistently*.
* Missing once happens. Missing twice is the start of a new habit (in the wrong direction).
* Discipline is easier when choices are removed, not added.

If you’re tired of cycling through guilt and self-blame every time your motivation fades, stop treating behavior like a feeling.

Habits don’t care if you’re in a good mood. Systems don’t need you to be inspired. The smartest way to win? Build a life where the good stuff *just kind of happens*. By default.

Let TikTok influencers yell about “hustle”. You’re here to build habits that don’t ask for permission.",1,1768999958.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
1qix2vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kaijufan22/comments/1qix2vj/in_the_shadow_of_the_blood_moon_part_2/,In The Shadow Of The Blood Moon part 2,"""Now that's just rude. Most folk in your position would say thanks."" He snarked. 

""Thanks."" The dirty blonde replied as she jammed the gun in the side of his skull. ""Now drive on down the road till I tell you."" she demanded. 

""Hold on now, think a wire got crossed here. You know where the rest of these fools are hold up?"" Travis demanded.

""I remember the way back, yes."" She admitted through gritted teeth. Travis slapped the wheel and horse laughed.

""Well then why the hell are wasting time with this pissing contest here, let's go get em-put that lil pop gun down."" He laid the charm on thick. She hesitated but lowered the pistol slightly.

Every instinct Travis had told him to grab it from her and bash her head in for even looking at it in his presence. He ignored those thoughts, at least until he got a grasp on whatever the hell was happening around here.

He started up the engine which purred like a newborn kitten. The jeep bolted forward, Travis could feel every bump on the jaded edge on the road. They sat in silence for a bit, each sizing up the other.

The dirty blonde looked to be in her early 20s-Travis had noticed a northern accent to her tone, Maine maybe. He had never met someone from Maine he didn't want to throttle. It seemed that tradition would hold fast. She has some light bruising on her arms and neck, but other than that she seemed in better shape than her fellow escapee. 

""Did you see anyone else out there?"" she inquired, startling Travis. 

""Talking bout that long haired pot belly fella, right? The New blood? Yeah, I found him-don't know what they did to him, but he died from his wounds. Buried him. Followed his trail."" He lied. 

""Fucking savages."" The dirty blonde muttered to herself. The car was greeted with silence once more, save for the occasional thump in the road. Travis could sense the fury boiling over from the passenger seat.

""Did you know him?"" He asked, trying to be pleasant. 

""Not really. They thought I was newly turned, that I had no control over the change. I got the drop on them, took out a few of the guards, he broke loose in the chaos. We went our separate ways. Never even got his name."" she said solemnly. 

""How long since you've been afflicted?"" Travis cracked. The dirty blonde shrugged. 

""Never was. I was born a freak."" she replied casually. Travis dropped his jester's smile at that. 

""No shit. My mas-the one who turned me- he said there were no pure bloods left in the states. Says they were all hunted down during the great purge."" He said bewildered. The dirty blonde looked at him cross-eyed. 

""Yeah-I guess not."" She shifted uncomfortably.  A newfound tension joined the cunning silence as they came to a fork in the road. The dirty blonde pointed left down a rocky road that had no trespassing sign out front. Travis cleared his throat as he made the turn.

""Look, we got off on the wrong foot here. My name's Travis."" He introduced himself. 

""Tammy."" she replied coolly. ""I don't know a whole lot about this group. They're held up in a bunker; there's a big cabin that serves as a front-I assume anyway. I don't know how many there are, but counting the two you got they're down about seven or eight people."" She informed. Travis gave her a nod

""Any advantage is a good one. How long they have you down there?""

""About a week. My own fault. Someone jabbed me from behind and I blacked out. When I came to, I saw- I'm not sure exactly. It looked like one of us, smelled like us. But it was older, and bigger than this jeep. I could feel his pain; it was radiating in waves off him from all the gunk and wires they pumped into him."" she said. Travis gripped the wheel in response.

 ""They injected me with some of his blood. Funky feeling but it didn't really have any effect on me. So, they locked me away with the others. None of them seemed to have been turned for more than a month, maybe two tops. They took five or six away to the back before I broke out. I don't know what happens back there but-It smells like death and ashes."" She shuddered at the memory of the dank bunker, and the stench of decay that surrounded it. Tammy eyed Travis with renewed suspicion. ""What are you doing out here anyway? I kind of find it hard to believe I'd run into someone else like me."" 

""Heh, I was up here on what you might call a spiritual retreat."" Travis beamed. He rolled the word ""Spiritual"" on his tongue-like it was his favorite word in the world. ""Tonight's the blood moon after all."" he said with reverence.

""Oh yeah, something to do with dust in the Earth's atmosphere reflecting light or something like that. My Bio professor mentioned something about it last week."" she remarked.  Now it was Travis who met her with a peculiar look.

""My word, woman, don't you know your own history?"" He scoffed. ""Why you're a god among these heathens?"" He sneered at her. They came to another left turn filled with foliage and muddled with tracks. He took it sharply, the whole jeep rumbling as he narrowed his eyes at her. 

""I mean I know what my mother told me about us-"" She started but Travis waved his hand dismissively.

""Nah, you don't know- I can tell by your voice. It was centuries ago, when our people didn't hide away in the dark. The lunar father loved all who dwelt under the moonlight but favored the cunning wolf. The wolf was strong and fierce but still suffered under the yolk of man's eternal hunt.""

""This angered the celestial above so much that he turned sanguine from rage-the great plains became marked with crimson as all of creation trembled in awe. Under this blood moon a den mother bore a litter under the merciful gaze of the lunar lord. One of these pups stood tall among his brothers, blessed with all the strengths of a wolf- yet walked like a man, thought like a man, could hunt like one.""

"" He was the first of his kind; his bite spread among the heathens, blessing the unenlightened with the mark of the lunar god's love."" Travis beamed as he spun his tale. Tammy shifted closer to the window, feigning a pleasant smile as she nodded her head along to the bizarre folklore he spoke of. 

""-All wolves are descended from the line of Varcolac, though he is known by many names. He was the first prophet, the first son of the moon. It doesn't surprise me your history is lost to you. My mentor knew all too well of the false god's suppression of our heritage."" Travis sneered. 

""Right. Well, my mother always told me something different, less-biblical I suppose."" She said with caution. The jeep was silent as it rolled down the road. Tammy looked out the window, recognizing the claw stripped bark and bullet holes decorating the trees. They were getting close.

""Out of curiosity, what fairy tales did your mother teach you?"" Travis pondered aloud, almost daring her to contradict him.

""A man was jealous of his brother, he had a bigger house, beautiful wife and the most plentiful herd in the village. One day his temper and jealousy got the better of him, and he slaughtered his brother and his family in cold blood. They say the gods were so horrified by the man's crimes they cursed him to forever walk the earth as a beast, never to know peace as he was forever plagued by hunter's arrows. He spread his curse across the land because-misery loves company I suppose. A few hundred years later here I am."" she finished. Travis scoffed at this.

 ""Is that how you see it; a blight over a divine blessing?"" He sneered, hands clenching the wheel.

 ""I wouldn't say blight-more like a livable curse."" She eased. 

""Agree to disagree."" Travis replied through gritted fangs. He would massacre the heretic later, when the humans had been dealt with. Perhaps the pure blood would make an ideal offering to the night orb above.

\------------

The jeep rolled to a crawl as a cabin came into view. There were three other jeeps parked out front sans drivers. The sun cast a low shadow on the sleepy cabin, yet no lights could be seen inside. A worn stone chimney rested on the side, wafts of smoke drifting into the sky.

The cabin roof was covered with shingles-rusty and burdened by the harsh weather. It was quiet and unassuming, not even a cricket dared chirp near it. Tucked away in the porch was a faint but obvious red dot. It flashed occasionally, the old-fashioned security camera pointing directly out into the clearing.

Lucky for the wolves they had pulled aside-they had not yet been seen by the cameras. The jeep idled on the side of the dissolute dirt road as they pondered their options. The sun was low now, draping a haunting silhouette on the cabin-like it was beckoning them inside.  Travis cleared his throat and turned to Tammy. 

""We move in the cover of darkness, under the gaze of the Bloodmoon."" he proclaimed. Tammy couldn't argue, they were probably on high alert with the escape. The last thing they would expect would be an assault on their stronghold. ""Would you care to join me in prayer as we prepare for battle and for the righteous change under the holy light?"" he spoke with reverence, eager to convert her. 

""I'm- not right now, I prefer to be alone for-that."" She stammered. Travis sneered for a second, his face twisting in fury. But he calmed himself, and quoted scripture at her as he left the driver's side. 

""The prophets say *""We bring the call of the wild to the sign of the sacristy/ Rest in the eye of our sanctity""*\- It is our duty as children of the moon to bring our light to those who have none. Consider that, my sister, as the night approaches."" With that he slinked off into the brush to grovel in worship of the sanguine moon, leaving Tammy there to wonder why the hell this nut job just quoted a metal band like they were the words of God.

\-----------

Tammy eyed Travis like a hawk as he kneeled before the coming moon. His arms were outstretched to the sky in praise as he mumbled prayers for forgiveness and servitude. She bounced her knees nervously. Whatever whacked out cult he belonged to skeeved the hell out of her.

She recalled her mother's own beliefs. She always thought it funny a werewolf would be such a devout catholic, but she supposed God had a sense of humor about that sort of thing. Every Sunday she would get dragged to mass, always getting an itching feeling when it fell on the day of a full moon.

Tammy enjoyed it however, everyone there was always so welcoming and kind. It was a nice reprieve from the schoolyard bullies. It had been sometime since she had said a prayer, and the thought flew across her mind like a bow in the wind. She brushed it off, almost embarrassed at the thought though she wasn't sure why.

She began to feel the weight of the rising star herself. She had resisted the call of the full moon most of her life-her mother had taught her to suppress her beastly urges well. She had never liked the change-the tearing of her skin to reveal a ghastly monster underneath.

But she had come to terms with it long ago- had never lost control of the wolf and rampaged into the night. Last night was the first time she had ever killed anyone. She could recall the taste of fear in their blood and could still hear the snapping of bones under her maw. It frightened her how easy it had been. Just like it frightened her how easy the crazed stranger had slaughtered those two guards to free her.

She furrowed her brow at the thought- no that scum needed to die, she was at peace with that part. She hated them for forcing her hand, and she was still furious at herself for getting caught. She was never much for the wilderness, preferring the chaotic comfort of the city.

 This morning, she was dazed and half naked, a winning combo for being lost in the woods.

She had heard the hunters coming this time and managed to hide from them at first. Or so she thought, as she was caught off guard by the zip of a tranq gun from nowhere. She had drifted off into the abyss, and woken up in the back of a jeep to the sound of two bickering hunters.  She was a poor wolf it seemed, least in the eyes of the mad man Travis. When they had freed the people below, she suspected she would have to be quick in her getaway.

As the night circled them, the moon above grew bold and bright-a ghastly shade of ember red coming down to greet them. Tammy held her breath and embraced the change-her world spinning as the wolf clawed at her mind. Travis basked in the celestial body's glow; he was nude and kneeling in muck, but he felt the loving embrace of God greeting him.

He opened his eyes cautiously, like he was afraid he would be deemed unworthy to gaze upon the blood-moon that night. The stars danced before him, the burning crimson wolf above looking straight back at him. He could feel the god speaking In his mind, it told him he was proud of Travis- he was a good son and soon enough his purpose would become clear.

With tears in his ocher eyes, he thanked the lord above and began the change. It felt different than usual, purer and more carnal. He tore the mortal skin from his body, arms morphing and growing as he became more bestial. Leathery skin with thick black fur took its place as he tore away at what remained of his humanity.

A few feet away from him the jeep rumbled and rattled as Tammy cried out, gums gushing blood as fangs tore through them. She bucked and kicked the dashboard, denting it as her cries became guttural and ravenous. The pain fried her senses; she could feel her mind breaking apart as the hunger of the wolf consumed her.

Travis never broke away from the moon's gaze as he grew and changed, foaming at the maw as he barked at the moon with joy. His lips curled in a smile as his snout enlarged, and he howled at the moon with vigor as he felt the nub of a tail form near his lower back.

Tammy bust out of the jeep, her frame leaner than his, more agile than his hulking physique. Her fur was a golden tint-eyes burning like fire in the night sky. She huffed and puffed as she clawed at the ground, fingernails still bleeding from the fresh change. She tasted iron in her mouth, and she salivated at the sensation.

Travis stood tall, a hulking eight feet at least, yet still hunched over as he lumbered over to the struggling Tammy. She stood up, about seven feet and snarled at the approaching black wolf. Travis made a deep clicking sound, like a dog trying to laugh. He spoke then-his voice graveled and deep, like he was speaking with rocks in his throat.

 ""Calm your senses sister. You neglect your real self-that much is obvious."" He said with a hint of disdain. Tammy ignored his remark and eyed the cabin. She pointed a gnarled claw at it.

""Want-their flesh-free-o-thers."" She choked out her command. Travis faced the cabin, the words of his god flooding his mind.

""You are chosen Travis-never forget that you're better than the roaches. Go and teach them the folly of their sin."" His master cooed in his ear. 

""Thy will be done."" Travis muttered to himself. He surged forward on all fours, lunging at the front door. The door was flimsy wood and rusted hinges; he tore through it and lumbered into the dark cabin. Tammy followed behind, her mind muddled and falling to instinct. She was not used to changing at the height of the cycle.

\------------

The inside of the cabin was small, claustrophobic even for the wolves. The walls were barre- rooms filled with boxes and dusty hunting trophies littered the place. It reeked of musk and mold, dust dancing in the moonlight as the patrolled. Deep from below, Travis heard a ringing- an alarm blaring and the thunderous sounds of panicked steps.

Tammy sniffed some boxes, a stuffed deer head pointing out of them. It stared at them with the lifeless eyes of a doll. In the corner was a bookcase, scuff marks in front of it. Travis sneered as he approached, grabbing hold of the case and ripping it out of the wall. Machinery ached and sparked as he tore it away and threw it against the bony cabin wall.

Hidden behind was a short hallway illuminated with fluorescent lights. An elevator stood tall at the end. The wolves rushed forward, the tortured cries of their brethren crying out for them. They sounded confused and afraid, surrounded by deadly silver and men with weapons. Tammy reached out towards the elevator, and with a grunt cracked open the sliding doors.

They cried out in pain, a horrid screech like metal pushing against metal. They looked down to see a shallow shaft. Far below the elevator roared to life, ascending to meet them. Travis jumped forward, clinging to the shaft with a clang. Tammy followed suit and the wolves skated down, using their claws to hug the walls, tearing into paneling and sparking wires as they descended.

They were gaining speed, the elevator fast approaching. With a huff he leapt from the hoist way and landed on the roof, shaking the roof of the elevator with fury. It halted to a dead stop, groans of a dying machine echoing out. From inside the cart Travis heard panicked murmurs and shouts. He could smell them through the oil and rust of the elevator. The stench of body spray and silver clung to them like ticks.

Travis grimaced and swiped at the ceiling hatch to the shocked gasps of the men trapped inside. From inside they could see the hulking outline of the beast with beady yellow eyes and a mouth full of glistening teeth that seemed to stretch for miles. They met him with gunfire, Travis roared and ducked back behind the motor as they fired. Bullets zipped through the air-viscous little silver streaks.

He lurched back towards the hatch as they reloaded and reared his head inside. The elevator was crowded, five men security gear-vests and tactical gas masks like they were handling chemicals all day. The bald one in the corner reached for his side arm-but Travis' reach was quicker and longer. He snagged the man-who howled as claws dug into his chest. Travis greedily tore into the man's face and tossed him aside, the still squirming body shaking the ground on impact.

Travis slithered into the elevator, mouthwatering as the dead men inside screamed and fired. Tammy watched the cart quiver with violence as Travis butchered them, the sounds of meat tearing apart and scattered gunfire. Bullets flew through the shaft, dinging the walls as they came to a sparking stop.

The light inside had an orange hue to it-it lights up the shaft like a blood-soaked jack-o-lantern. As the screaming died down and was replaced with gluttonous feeding, a bloodied man scurried up the top of the hatch. His face was caked in gore, his dull blue eyes dancing around the dank shaft.

His name was David-a middle-aged man who had misgivings about what they did there-yet didn't lift a finger to stop it. He gasped for bloodless air; Travis was gnawing on a femur, oblivious to the escapee. If he could climb the wiring-maybe he would live to see dawn.

On the wall beside him he heard hot, wheezing breath.

He trembled; he turned to see ember eyes staring back at him- a slender figure glued to the wall on all fours. The beast's mouth stank of dry tuna and wet dog-it panted at him, eyeing him like a slab of steak. David was frozen with fright; he could feel warmth pooling down his leg.

The beast with flamed eyes seemed to unhinge its jaw, slowly grasping his scalp around it. He could feel rows of teeth begging to clamp down on his skull, nipping at the edge of his skin. Fresh blood dripped down his head-his vision became blurry with crimson ichor. There was a pounding pressure on his skull, like his head was splitting open.

As the wolf's jaws clamped down-sinking into the bone and brain matter-he had a final spasm as his eyes rolled back, and David browned out as the maw tightened. His ear drums popped and crackled from pressure-fluid filling them as the beast crunched down. Its powerful jaws were like a bear trap, slowly crushing his skull as David was in excruciating pain every millisecond.

A pinkish-gray goo spilled out of his nose-he tried to speak but found himself sputtering and babbling. His vision became further obscured by crimson and the abyss-a crunch rang out- and he was gone. 

A headless corpse fell to the floor-interrupting Travis' banquet. He tossed aside a gnawed forearm still gripping a broken pistol as he listened to the frenzied chewing above. Splintered bone flew down-the marrow licked clean as Tammy hacked and clawed at her prize. She crawled down, savoring her kill like a dog proud of her chew toy.

\-------------

Travis stood hunched in the car, lights dull and orange like a dying flame. He was surprised at the animalistic behavior of one who claimed to be a wolf her whole life. Then again, she clearly despised this side of herself, perhaps she was out of practice. He kneeled down to commune with her, hoping to convey some sort of plan or at least keep her from swallowing the hunk of bone whole. Tammy pulled away from him-snarling like he was going to try and take what remained of the skull.

""Bah."" He spat. ""Choke on it then."" He eyed the control panel and batted it with his gnarled hand. The elevator lurched downward, the only sounds were the chokes of Tammy spitting out bone. She stood among the gore, gathering her thoughts.

\------------

The lights so vivid-smells so clear. She wanted to hunt, needed to hunt-needed to feed.

No, no she had a mission she needed to focus. The tall wolf stood near; he reeked of death. He seemed annoyed by her-this was no good, he was strong, a fighter-she needed to do better to please hi-

no NO- what was she saying, she was Tamara-Tamara Talbot, she wasn't an animal, she wasn't a wolf. She was something in between, she wasn't a slave to her instincts. Lights dimmed, the cart grinded to a halt. She took deep breaths.

The room smelled of food-she was hungry she-

she had killed someone, someone who was trying to hurt her; maybe? She struggled to remember, struggled to think-to be rational. She stood tall, back legs shaking like a newborn deer as she pushed the animal back.

She snarled at the tall wolf as the elevator doors opened. She pushed past him, the white halls blinding. A dull light kept going on and off, and she winced and whined as a shrill sound blared overhead. The tall wolf grimaced next to her, swiping at something above their heads. It collapsed to the ground in a heap as the shrill sound faded. She eyed him, grunting in gratitude. She cleared her throat, struggling to find the words.

""Th-is way-big-like us."" She struggled. Travis got the gist of it.

\------------

He stepped over the shattered intercom-the alarm still blaring throughout the facility.  The walls were labeled with colored lines: green, blue and red. The green line led to a double door labeled ""kennels."" While the blue led to a sealed metal door to their left. The red line followed the green like a somber companion. Travis stomped towards the blue line door as an intercom rattled to life in the distance. A commanding voice sounded off in the distance.

 ""This is Abbott-lock down the kennel and prepare purge protocol! This is not a drill!"" His voice echoed throughout the bunker. Travis put aside the word ""purge"" for a moment as he stood before the metal door. There was a port hole in the front, it was more like a pressurized bulkhead. Through the porthole he could see a massive thing in there, heaving its body through labored breaths.

He opened the door, it swung heavy, grinding like it wanted to hide away the shame. He crept forward, the muffled wheeze of the great wolf before him filled the void of silence. Tammy wasn't lying-the great beast was at least the size of a hummer. Yet it was lanky and emaciated-its skin dry and cracked. Its grey fur was frayed and weathered-like he was in the final stages of mange. His chest was pock marked and covered in cysts and sickly liver spots.

The great wolf was muzzled- ears clipped and forced to wear blinders like a racehorse. Countless wires and tubes were stuck in him, coiled around the great one like hungry vipers. Machines pumped and whirred sucking the life force from it and recycling back into him.

Around him was an assortment of tools and medical equipment used to poke, prod and bleed the wolf. Travis stood before the elder trembling with rage. He reached out towards the wheezing thing as the equipment beeped and breathed-attempting to remove the blinders.

They came off easy, the elder didn't even register. His eyes a pure milky cloud, gunk crusting up around them in a sickly manner. Travis put his hands on the elder's head. It flinched at his touch, rambling against its shackles. He soothed the beast, taking his head in his hands carefully. He felt so frail, Travis smelt longing and aged cruelty on the great beast-who knows how long he had wasted away in the dark?

The great beast moaned in agony-and Travis knew what must be done.

Tamara entered the room just in time to see Travis grab a silver laden tool off a table and ram it swiftly into the elder's skull. Steam poured from his hand as he twisted the tool, the great beast struggling for only a moment. The equipment keeping the ancient wolf alive cried out in mourning as Travis embraced him, feeling the life drain away as the elder went limp in his arms.

When the beast had passed-he threw the murder weapon aside, his hand still steaming and burnt. He laid the creature to rest on the floor, cradling the head like a child with his toy. Tammy cried out at the murder, a sharp bark that barely pierced Travis' ears.

""You-killer-why did you-"" She growled, ready to tear the bastard's throat out. Travis stood tall, looming over her as he raved at her.

 ""You see this-this travesty-and you have the audacity to ask why I give release?!?"" He snarled at her.  He brushed past her, hurrying to the kennels. ""Come child. If they treat an elder this way I shudder at what they are doing to the new bloods.""

\------------

Tamara followed suit, the fog of her mind clearing as she took more control. They ran through the halls with no resistance. The Bunker was smaller than you would think. As they followed the green and red lines, they passed several rooms that were set up as locker rooms, break-rooms, even office spaces one would use for accounting. They smelled like stale coffee and donuts, a hint of red velvet from someone's birthday. The grounds of those offices were littered with shredded paper and documents and panicked interns destroying evidence.

They passed an armory, fully stocked and loaded with riffles and stun guns. Held up in the corner was a sniveling intern with a purple tie, praying as he held a gun to his chest. The wolves ignored the peons-up ahead; they heard the faint sound of gunfire. Overheard Abbot repeated his ominous message as they raced through the halls. They came before a blue double door and burst through it.

They were met with rows upon rows of large kennels.  Each one held a snarling wolfman clawing and yipping at their chains. Blue overhead lights filled the halls, the floors concrete and sticky from mess. The green line ended and the red broke off into different sections, all leading into eight walls of kennels on each side. The place reeked of wet dog and dirty fur, the barks and howls bounced off the walls against each other, complimented by the canon fire of guns cutting off pained wolves.

Guards were going from kennel to kennel, cleaning the cages of their occupants. There was no time to argue, the pair broke off and sprinted down the halls. They surprised the guards who turned to fire upon them, but were met with teeth and claws. The scent of fresh blood riled up the caged wolves like chum in shark infested waters. They rattled their chains, wolves of all shapes and sizes. The guards fired upon the pair but were no match for them as they sliced and gnawed through them.

Limbs flew and bodies were slashed; it was a ballet of death. Travis roared in pain as a bloodied guard snuck up on him and jabbed him in the back with a cattle prod. It buzzed and zapped, the electricity frying him. He whipped around and grabbed his assailant's arm and twisted. It snapped and tore like an old G.I. Joe. Travis grabbed the prod and rammed it into the guard's mouth, shattering teeth as he plunged it down his throat and pulled the trigger. The guard spasmed and collapsed to the ground, eyes lighting up like a Christmas tree.

Tamara bobbed and weaved against the men, trying to disarm rather than kill. A bullet grazed her shoulder, stinging like an angry wasp. She saw red as she pounced at the begging man, tearing into him as she mauled him to death with gleeful rage.

Travis was like a hulking brute; he battered men to death with their buddy's torso and howled with sick pleasure as he butchered the guards. The remaining caged wolves cheered them on, howling and braying like madmen gone wild. He dragged half a dismembered body, a trail of intestine following suit. He saw a control panel, and slashed away at it until sparks flew and alarm bells rang out.

The cages opened in unison, and the remaining humans didn't even try to fight the wave of vengeance that fell on them. The caged wolves were like mindless beasts, free for the first time in months, free to embrace their new forms. They ran through the bunker like a plague of locusts, devouring anyone they came across. Travis revealed in the carnage, basking in it as the freed wolves gave praise to their liberator.

Tamara stood back, meat spilling from her bloodied maw as she stood appalled. It was pure chaos, pure killing for the sake of it. Was this the revenge she had sought? She backed herself against a wall as she watched in horrified awe as the brutality played out before her.

\----------

Travis followed the red lines, even among the chaos. It was like a blood trail leading him to a final atrocity. He got a whiff of it, even though all the gore. The decayed smell of dead wolves and burning bodies. The final lines led to a brass door tucked away from the back. There was a sign atop it that simply read: ""Processing.""

He entered the room, a massive meat locker. Dozens of bloodied meat hooks hung from the rafters, some with the hung bodies of skinned wolves. Their throats cut, blood drains littering the crimson stained floor. His feet clicked on the tiles as he made his way through the atrocity. The room was filled with crates and push bins filled to the brim with furs and coats. Wolf pelts were mounted on drying racks, staring at him with lifeless sockets. 

To his right another room, he could feel the heat from where he stood. He didn't want to go in there, see the burnt remains and ash piles. He stood among the slaughtered, and felt nothing but unbridled anger. He was so engrossed he didn't hear the high stepping man behind him with a loaded revolver.

He felt the punch of the silver slugs as they tore through his back. He roared and collapsed, his back smoking with tainted mist. His head spun and doubled as he clung to the cool tiled floor. A sticky, moist warmth formed under him, and he gasped with choked breaths as he watched his own blood begin to pool. The man stepped over him, the sounds of fighting and carnage from outside a distant whisper now.

In his dying moments, he heard his father's voice. There was fire in his words, yet they dripped with remorse.

""It's not too late for you, my boy. Repent-repent and call out to the light. You don't deserve to get put down like a dog."" His father mourned. Travis blinked, his vision a tunnel of light. In it he saw shapes call out to him, begging him to turn away. He wanted to join them-the light felt so warm and inviting.

""You know better, Travis. You have the blood of the beast flowing through you like a raging river. Now start acting like it."" The commanding voice of his master boomed to him, pulling him back into the fold.

The voices began to fade, as the command of the moon ordered him to rise. He readied himself, grieving the loss of the warmth. It had felt so real so- No. He struck that thought down. It was deception from the false idol, trying to draw him back into the flock. He felt himself healing as he pledged himself to the wolf once more. Reality snatched him back as he steeled his heart.

\----------

Alonzo Abbott looked at the dying creature at his feet and sighed, admiring the shine of his pelt. Damn shame, easy 10K he thought to himself as he holstered his revolver. He wore a bloodstained apron and wore blue latex gloves, his hair long and greased back. His face was sunken and rugged, rough to the touch like the tread of a tire. He listened to the sum of his life's work outside tearing itself to shreds. 

It didn't matter now he supposed-he had made a fortune off selling the blood and tears of these creatures, he could escape through the loading bay tunnels-a long walk for sure but at least he'd be alive. Once he escaped, he'd retire comfortably-hell with how much he had stashed away he could figure he could buy a whole island or two.

Still, the sting of losing this money maker was an ego burn for sure. He looked down on the dying thing, it looked back, like the dumb animal was sneering at him. He scoffed and kicked it across the jaw. He felt the creature's heavy head under his boot, relishing the clicking thud it made. He turned his back on it and took out his tape recorder-an old habit from his vet days. 

""Personal memo-once I get out of this place send a clean-up crew, incinerate everything, you don't need the wolves at your door down in Cabo do you Alonzo?"" He joked to himself. He turned to see the wolf stumbling to his feet. He raised an eyebrow, but didn't reach for his gun. He taunted the wobbling beast instead. 

""Look at the wild animal, he doesn't know he's dead yet. Fall down and stay down pup."" He waived a dismissive hand at the thing. The wolf stood tall, clasping a hand around his wounds. Abbot felt the hatred on his hot breath and stepped back.

""Get back-I'll skin you like the rest of the mongrels"" he growled. He reached to draw on the monster and finish him once and for all. He was quick.

But Travis was faster.

He grabbed Abott by the neck and lifted him in the air. His grasp was firm yet deadly. Travis growled from the pit of his stomach, shooting daggers into Abbot's face. He struggled, gasping for air as his airways were slowly crushed. His skin became a light shade of violet as Travis tightened the noose. 

""You-miserable little piss ant. My body flows with god's golden ichor-you think-silver will stop me?!?"" He got out-hiding the searing pain as he focused his mind.

 ""Y-you can talk?"" was all Abbott could choke out. Outside the wolves roared for more food, demanding another morsel. Travis stormed towards the brass door and kicked it open. He showed the horde the squirming Abbott in his hands as they foamed at the mouth. He brought Abott close to his snout to give him a final farewell. 

""This isn't personal human-this is simply divine retribution. This is the night of the werewolves. Now run for your life."" With that he tossed him to the crowd. Abbott stumbled to his feet as the wolves encircled him. To his credit he didn't beg, he didn't cry. He went for his gun and got a round off before the wolves pounced and began tearing him to bits. By the time they were finished all that remained of Abbott was a bloodstain on the floor and some chewed bones.

The leaderless pack roared and cheered like loons in the night-then turned their attention to each other. The wolves barked and jeered at each other like wild dogs, which Travis supposed they were. He watched them begin to turn on each other, these lost godless souls. Travis stepped forward and roared. The marauding wolves stepped back cowering. 

""Brothers and sisters-cease your petty bickering. You've been down here too long-your minds are wasted away-let me guide you to the promised land. You've never even seen him up close, have you?"" He pondered that last bit to himself as he plowed through the crowd, leading his found flock out of the dark.

\-----------

Tamara was not a part of that-she had slipped away in the chaos and climbed backup stairs. She had her fill. The mindless feeding sickened her now. What these hunters had done was abhorrent, but as she looked upon the scattered remains-she felt hollow. There had been no justice in this. Under the watchful crimson eye, she changed back, a painful force but the danger had passed. 

She found the jeep, still rumbling away in the night and stole it. As she drove away from the bunker of horrors-she noticed something sticking out of the sun visor.

She opened it and an old rosary fell to her hands. As the Jeep tumbled and rolled on the rocky road, she felt the wooden cross under her bloodstained nails. Her mother had always told her to say her prayers at night, lest the devil come under the moonlight and whisk her away. She thought of the lives she had taken, and the cross felt heavy in her hands. She placed it on her lap and stared straight ahead, silently reciting a prayer for the dead, and for mercy to be had on those who remained. 

\-------------------

The wolf pack poured out of the shaft and into the shadows of the night. Free for the first time in months they danced and howled, marveling at the majesty of the moon above. Travis climbed the roof of the cabin, basking in the glory of triumph. The wolf pack cheered him on-howling and braying like good little followers. He pointed up at the crimson lord and called out to his flock. 

""This is your god my friends-and I am its prophet."" He roared to thunderous howls. ""You are all blessed under the shadow of the blood moon. Hear my words, and worship at my altar."" The wolves cried out in praise, praise for the moon and praise for him. He basked in their adoration. There would be much work to be done in the morning-once the haze of blood and gore had passed.

This place would make a good den for the pack. He would sort them out, teach them the proper ways like his master before him. There were about forty total wolves, a good start indeed-soon enough he would teach them to seek out others he would deem worthy of the blessing, others worthy of their creed.

But that was tomorrow. For now, he joined the chorus of bellowing monsters, celebrating the god above. As he indulged in the carnal galla with the rest of the pack. The sanguine night belonged to them, and the forest would forever tremble against their never-ending lust for blood.

I’m 32. He’s 74. My mom was 71 when she died very suddenly in August. From the beginning it felt like he was doing “too much” in terms of saying “there will be no one like your mom for me” even a day after she died. And “thanking” her after he got the life insurance payout (wasn’t a ton — not a lie changing amount and he’s not in any kind of debt). Just felt over the top and out of character but I tried to brush it off as weird grieving. 

Then a couple months later he said he was asking out an old friend for coffee since she was diagnosed with cancer, and that he would take her to appointments and such if needed. Then he found out she had a whole support system already. 

I also recently had moved back home after taking a year to travel abroad and was about to sign a lease for an apartment but it felt like too much and so I decided to stay at home for a bit to help him. When I talked about moving out in October, he got kind of upset and said he’d be lonely and didn’t want me to go. Sure, it is kinda soon. 

I also fly out of province for two weeks at a time for work so we do have time apart at least. I got back from one of these work trips and he took me out for breakfast and said he’d added someone he knew from years ago on Facebook and was going to ask her for “coffee and then see what happens” and when I mentioned my mom had not been gone even six months, “you try being alone in that house for that long”. 

I had to go to the car and cry all the way home. They were married for 40 years. Not even six months after you want to replace her? You want to have her in the home my mom built for 32 years. I feel sick. I feel like I hate him. After a series of unfortunate incidents at Christmas (he never asks about me, he didn’t bother doing anything for Christmas, buys all his own groceries (and doesn’t even ask if there’s anything I need while I’m at home to try and help him cook and clean…) 

I just have this overwhelming thought of “I wish you’d died and not her”. I know I can’t say that. But it’s true. It just is. My mom would never want to just move on, especially so quickly. She loved him and would mourn him. She cared about me and my siblings. She tried to make every occasion special for us. She was my person. And now she’s gone. And my dad wants to put some random person in \*\*my mom’s\*\* house to replace her. 

How can you say you loved someone if you’re ready to move on so quickly? I just don’t understand. 

And it makes me sick to be around him now. I’ll do anything to get out of this house and away from him. (I have been actively trying for a couple months but there’s waitlists for almost every apartment building here) 

I don’t know if this is more vent or asking for help or… what. I don’t know. But I don’t know what to do and how to not hate him and get through this. ",3,1768999243.0,GriefSupport,3,1.0,False

1qiwrxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/EeveelutionSquadComic/comments/1qiwrxu/im_finally_done/,IM FINALLY DONE,"After days of being unmotivated to finish it for one reason or another, I now present…

**My Eeveelution Squad fan story**

(It’s really just the endgame of Legends Z-A plus the DLC except the Pokemon have backstories and personalities and can talk, but that’s really all the og series was meant to be. That was a Mystery Dungeon comic. Until it wasn’t. But anyway…)



Arceus watched what happened to Shade and the other people that disappeared after the final chapter and decided to give them a second chance… in another universe. With humans. One by one the Pokemon of that universe were brought back, and so were their Berserk Virus infections, meaning they were more powerful than most normal Pokemon. He was reluctant to bring Shade back, but he eventually decided to bring him back with the downside that he wouldn’t be in his own body. Shade accepts, and then wakes up inside the mind of the Absol that was saved from Rogue Mega Evolution in Lumiose City. Then his memories start flooding back and he remembers everything and instantly feels regret. Regret at his actions, regret at how stupid his justification for it all was, regret for hating Speed and now ending up in a similar situation as him being unable to truly die and just being born in another body, all he feels is regret. Did he ever even care about those dangerous wild Pokemon or the safety of the innocent, or did he just want power and control? Regardless, he’s only left with regret.



 After waking up fully inside that other Absol’s body, Shade took out his regret and anger on Lebanne and everyone in Jacinthe’s tournament (except for Lady Jacinthe herself), as well as the next set of Rogue Mega Evolving Pokemon. (Unfortunately his trainer was an idiot and died to Mega Tyranitar so let’s just say he used his OP powers to revive him while Naveen was looking away as to not horrify him.) 



Eventually he finds Team Flare Norveau and then learns all about the backstory of Team Flare and how Grisham and Griselle were affected by their reputation. Reasonably, after hearing about yet another man (technically two if you count Lysandre AND AZ) who, in an attempt to protect that which he cared about, killed thousands more, and already still being unstable at this time, Shade breaks down again and destroys Griselle’s team easily. After he calms down, night falls and eventually they fight Grisham for the final promotion match. Grisham reveals that he wants to take AZ’s Floette to save Lumiose himself so he can be the hero and salvage his reputation. Hearing that, both Shade and his trainer are even more motivated to win, and again wipe the floor with him on the  first attempt. 



Meanwhile in Wild Zone 19, the same place that trainer caught many Pokemon from Shade’s universe such as Speed and Flare, a strange portal opens up and an Eevee hops out of it. Some of the trainer’s Pokemon had went to Wild Zone 19 for a walk since Shade and some others were already handling the promotion match. They are the only ones who notice the portal. The Eevee doesn’t have a proper name in mind, but having found him in the dead of night, and his soon to be trainer even catching him in a dusk ball, he considers naming himself ‘Moonlight’. At least until he can remember… whatever it is he feels like he’s forgetting. 



Back to the battle, after Grisham is defeated he gives this speech about how people may never forget what Team Flare did, but he and his group (and L/Lysandre) will move on and try to help Lumiose regardless of their past. And with his trainer having just become the strongest Mega Evolution user, Shade is empowered to do the same. He ruined his own world, and there’s no going back to it, but maybe he can save a part of this one. 



Right after they go to Hotel Z again, the thing AZ knew would happen finally happens. Prism Tower goes rogue and someone needs to save it. Once again someone selfishly decides that they wanted to be the hero to take Mega Floette to the top of the tower and stop this madness. This time it was Taunie, the leader of Team MZ. Even after Shade’s new trainer beat her fair and square, Floette chose to go with her while *he* was left to go with Zygarde as a backup in case something goes wrong. Minutes later, something goes wrong. The tower goes berserk, Rogue Mega Evolution happens everywhere, and every notable trainer is fighting them off the best they can.  Eventually they get on a rooftop where Zygarde is, with L waiting for them to make sure they are prepared. And then the final battle begins. And Shade figuratively carries the whole team on his back. Even Bois the Heracross barely did anything compared to him (which is a first, possibly in history). And so the day is saved, Floette (and Taunie too I guess) lives, AZ dies peacefully, Team MZ and their Pokemon mourn his death, we go back and take his/Korrina’s Lucario that he left for us, use said Lucario to help catch “the one who gives” and “the one who takes” (not Zygarde tho, he’s too strong for them at the moment), also catch Diancie and Mewtwo, and then they just live peacefully for the next two months. 



Sometime later, as the trainer goes up to the roof to look at the aftermath of the Rogue Ange Floette event, some little girl jumps down from the rooftop, introduces herself as Ansha, casually reveals she has the mythical mischief Pokemon Hoopa, and then just… asks them to make some donuts for Hoopa. The trainer obliges, and then it is eventually revealed that those donuts give Hoopa the power to use Hyperspace Hole and summon a portal leading to a place eventually known as Hyperspace Lumiose. After doing some research tasks relating to this place for Corbeau of the Rust Syndicate (who for some reason is handling this instead of Mable or Sycamore or CLEMONT AND BONNIE), they find a Hyperspace Hole similar to the Rogue Mega Arenas of our Lumiose. Shade and his trainer walk through into that other dimension and find… another Absol. But this one seems familiar to Shade. It was his little cousin, Spike. 



In his past life, Shade hadn’t given Spike a second thought because in his eyes, Spike was beneath him. He wasn’t strong enough, he never had the initiative to stop was Shade saw as a threat to their lives and instead focused on his rivalry between Trace and Hydra. Their hatred for Trace was basically the only thing that they had in common, but it was for entirely different reasons. Spike just had a normal friendly rivalry with him, while Shade HATED him for being friends with Speed, another feral Pokemon, and even protecting him and lying about him to the town. But after everything that happened in both of their lives, they crossed paths again in this area of Hyperspace. And Spike looked like he was in even more pain than the previous Rogue Megas that Shade had seen. And then he mega evolved and revealed a new Z-Mega for Absol that drastically improved his power, but drained his energy faster as a result. Shade couldn’t bear to see his family in pain like this. This is what he was trying to prevent in the past, he wanted to prevent others from being hurt like this after watching a family get slaughtered in front of him. Soon enough, Shade’s trainer, Taunie, and Korrina all worked together with their Pokémon to defeat the Absol and caught him. (They also found some butter for the donuts because I guess this dimension has that but I don’t really care.) After seeing the pain Spike went through in that form, and the form even looking like how Pokemon infected by the berserk virus looked, Shade decided to swap mega stones with him to take that burden off his hands… and as a type of punishment for himself and what he did. 



While doing some more research tasks to figure out what is up with that other dimension, discovering and defeating even more Rogue Megas along the way (including the legendary HEATRAN), Shade eventually has a conversation with Spike, wondering if maybe they can see some other Pokemon from their world and maybe even apologize and make amends with them. As they were pondering on that, their trainer was called to the Rust Syndicate Office (again). They eventually come to the conclusion that Hyperspace Lumiose was formed from the subconscious of its citizens and Pokemon alike and is starting to affect the real Lumiose due to the influence of Darkrai. 

Being influenced by the subconscious of those in real Lumiose, Hyperspace Lumiose also reflects the dreams and wishes of the people residing there. This was shown when the three humans who defeated the previous Rogue Megas went to fight Mega Darkrai after feeding Hoopa a “Mega Donut” to make a bigger portal (the word “mega” is gonna make me have a mental breakdown by the end of this) and they and their Pokemon saw the deceased AZ speak to them one last time before truly resting in peace. This world was influenced by their thoughts and dreams. And as long as those inter-dimensional holes kept showing up across Lumiose (which they seemingly did indefinitely), they could see so many people and Pokemon and do so many things and they could carry over to our reality. 



After the trio had defeated Darkrai, there was still the quest to capture the “fine Pokemon for \[Ansha’s\] mom”, so that was the top priority, but after that… so many Pokemon from Shade’s universe and the many alternate versions of it created from the Cycle of Rebirth could come to Lumiose with him. If AZ is anything to go by, he could even see the other Pokemon that were erased alongside Shade and even bring back dead Pokemon from other universes. So after catching the three Ancient Pokemon (Ansha saw Rayquaza in Hyperspace and wanted to catch him for her mother Diantha, but decided not to take it from the trainer that caught it)(I also caught them on or around Christmas too), Shade and Spike then spent the next couple of days just searching for those from their own time, along with some other versions of them. 



Eventually everyone had finally reunited. After meeting all of the other unique characters of that universe, Shade and Spike had once again met with the OG Eeveelution Squad. Spike briefly apologized to Lazuli for being… kinda creepy towards her, while Shade tried to apologize to Speed and Flare and Solar and everyone and eventually broke down crying. Flare, being the kind soul he is, immediately comforted him and said that he was just happy that he could be saved in the end. After Shade finally calmed down, Flare noticed three Eevees hiding away. Sunshine had evolved into a Sylveon recently, right when Axel had evolved into a Jolteon, so he knew none of them were her. But one of them was a female… 

He walked up to them and… the female introduced herself as Sunshine? He then noticed there was another Jolteon near her that looked similar to his big brother Speed. The Jolteon introduced himself as Alan and claimed to be Sunshine’s dad. He then remembered what he saw in his dream. That Sunshine was the Sunshine that died and became the Berserk Virus, and the Jolteon was the one that caused the creation of the Cycle of Rebirth, the Memory Path, and everything that came with it. Somehow they were brought back too, and not just left to die or fused with their current incarnation or something. But he couldn’t worry about that yet because there were still two more Eevees. One of them confidently introduced themselves as Starlight. He recognized that name instantly. Some Category 3 berserkers would form a bond with their virus, now taking the form of the host or one of its evolutionary stages. Solar (or Leafeon Flare) had Starlight, and Flare had… could that other one be…?

He went over to the other Eevee. That Eevee didn’t remember anything, but he gave himself the name Moonlight because he felt that name was significant in some way. Flare had heard that name somewhere before too. It was the name Sunshine would’ve been given if she were a boy in the original timeline. In his timeline, Sunshine was originally named Lily, and her parents were killed by wild Pokemon before she was born. Since the virus came from the original Sunshine, and he used to be a form of the virus before he gained his own form, this could be him… 

Flare asks “Moonlight” if he remembers the name “Fluffy” at all. After a brief moment of silence, he finally responds: “Mr. Flare?” They run up to each other and hug. Fluffy also mentions that he remembers seeing that memory of Sunshine too, when her parents were deciding her name. He said that he wants to keep the name Moonlight because of that, but Flare could keep calling him Fluffy if that’s easier for him. Many other people miraculously came back to them too, such as Frost/Shard, Black’s brother, as well as Mrs. Mollie, the mother of Speed, Flare, and Crystal. Everyone starts talking about everything that’s happened in their lives, the good and the bad. And Alan overhears it. Stella, Alan’s wife who died before Sunshine was born, was also magically revived and overheard it. And Sunshine overheard it too. All the craziness that they went through happened because she was careless and wanted to meet Jirachi and make a wish. Then her “daddy” ended up wishing that it never happened and created… everything that happened. Alan and Jirachi were worshipped by the berserkers, the ones created by Alan’s negative emotions and Sunshine’s shattered self. After hearing it all (and crying for a little bit, she’s still a kid after all), she eventually promised to try and help everyone and make sure that disaster never happens again. When she said that, the last remnants of the virus left Shade, Flare, and everyone else that was infected in it across all the universes. She had taken it all at once. It was painful for her, the virus can drain energy and even life force in extreme cases, but she was willing to bear it all so that everyone could be safe and happy and chase after their dreams. Somehow she managed to survive, but she was in pain and on the verge of crying. After seeing that, everyone made up their minds. Those who had harmed everyone’s lives, indirectly or otherwise, such as Shade and Sunshine would try to keep everyone safe and make sure that they’re all happy the best they can. There were also some like Speed and Spike who hadn’t done anything wrong but still wanted to help people and make them stronger so they can face life’s challenges. And then most of the Pokemon just wanted to live their lives. They would be there to support each other, of course, but they still had their own dreams and aspirations they were chasing after. Pearl the Espeon even mentioned one such idea: her and the original Eeveelution Squad could set up a little coffee shop for other Pokemon to eat, drink, and relax at, either at the beginning of the day or after a long day. Regardless of what they all aspired for, all of them were going to go through life together and never let themselves be separated by their differences again. Regardless of what they had done and seen in their pasts, they were going to look towards the brighter future… together.

I have a close friend Sara 20F. I met her last year at the start of school and we have been friends since. Sara didn't drop out and she is continuing her studies. So me and Sara were very close and we'd call every day to study, discuss projects upon seeing each other at school every day and drinking coffee together after school. I have some trouble with my family and my boyfriend and I are getting engaged so that is also very stressful, so it was the best decision for me to drop out. My mom is a SAH mom who works only a few times and my dad works 6 days a week and we are ok financially, but not great. Sara on the other hand, her parents own 2 houses, Sara lives with her parents has her own floor in the house, own bathroom, walk in closet and her dad pays for everything and gives her the same allowance as our rent probably. All she does is study, go to theatre once a week, do golf and pilates/gym and work part time whenever she feels like it and she travels quite often. It is very obvious that she doesn't know what real stress is or how it can affect someone in such a way that I'd drop out.

So when I finally made the decision to dropped out Sara just said ""ok"" and I confronted her about her friendship, because she knew the struggles I go through and she just said ""we have spoken about this for the past week, you have clearly made up your mind and I respect that, it is not up to me to push your boundaries now. If you want to drop out, then you do whatever is best for you, for me nothing changes"". It basically felt like she didn't care at all. After I dropped out she stopped calling me every day she'd call me a few times in a week. I asked her a few times about her recent grades (as I didn't make those exams but she did and I was just curious whether she had passed them or not) but she didn't really say anything she'd just say ""everything is fine, don't worry"".

So basically she changed after I dropped out, we didn't have secrets and we'd call everyday now she doesn't even care. She called a few times to check up on me but that was it, so I removed her from my close friends and she didn't even text me to ask what was going on. I texted her saying that I wasn't gonna go to the concert that we'd go to at the end of the month Sara texted me back exactly this ""ohh ok no problem babes"".  Then I asked her if she could pay me back for my ticket (she was invited by the team of the artist as she knows so didn't need a ticket and tickets costed 100 euro's and Sara paid for mine and I was supposed to pay her back and I had paid 50 euros already, but I also kind of cancelled because I didn't have the money for the other 50 yet and she didn't even ask me if that was te reason). Sara texted back she said ""send me your IBAN"" and she transferred 200 euros with the description ""Friends right"".

I texted her saying she transferred too much money and she said ""no, if anything it's too little):"". I don't get what she meant or tried, but she still hasn't even asked if I'm doing alright or not and why I cancelled. Now I am wondering AITAH for cancelling?",2,1768998967.0,AITAH,2,0.75,False

1qiwqbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qiwqbr/i_think_im_finally_ready_to_stop_drinking/,I think I’m finally ready to stop drinking.,"This is going to be a bit of a long winded rambling post, but I just need to type out my thoughts.

Stopping alcohol is something that’s been on my mind for a while, but I haven’t ever felt truly ready to do it until now. I’ve been sober for 11 days and I’m feeling really good about it. Last weekend was the first weekend I didn’t drink in who knows how long. Maybe it's the placebo effect, but I already feel like I have more energy, my thinking is less “foggy” and I’m sleeping better. Alcohol has definitely had a negative impact on my health and quality of life. I’m overweight and alcohol calories plus overeating while drunk have played a big role in that. I’m tired of waking up on a Saturday morning dehydrated and tired, needing to pound water and multiple coffees before I feel ready to do anything.

I’m a 32 year old man, I’ve been a fairly heavy drinker for almost a decade and a moderate drinker since my early teens. Most weekends over the past few years I would drink a couple of bottles of wine on a Friday night and most of a bottle of whisky on a Saturday. I would also often have drinks in the evening on weekdays to satisfy cravings. I often stayed up late drinking alone while watching a movie or playing videogames after my wife went to bed. Upon reflection I really regret choosing alcohol over going to bed with my wife. I think I’ve been borderline alcoholic or functionally alcoholic for a while. Like a lot of people on this subreddit, I don’t really have an off-switch when it comes to drinking, I can’t have one or two drinks and then stop. I often just keep drinking until all the booze is gone or I fall asleep, past the point where I derive any enjoyment from it. I’m Scottish and a toxic relationship with alcohol is very common here, the culture encourages binge-drinking and casual drinking throughout the week isn’t seen as a big deal. I think this is changing for the younger generations but is still the case for people my age and older.

Alcohol doesn’t really have a negative impact on my personality like it does with some people, so I think this has prevented me from hitting rock bottom and realising that my drinking is unsustainable before now. I’m quite a chill, laid back, reserved guy, so alcohol just makes me a bit more chatty, sociable and “fun”, or sleepy if I have too much. Both of my grandfathers were serious alcoholics of the mean, angry, abusive variety, they allowed alcohol to control their lives, tarnish their relationships with their families and contribute to their relatively early deaths. My grandmothers were also both heavy drinkers, so it’s definitely in my genes. My dad is also a heavy drinker, but like me was never a mean or aggressive drunk. Something that is both a blessing and a curse is that I don’t get “blackout” drunk, no matter how much I drink I always remember all the embarrassing things I said and did while drunk.

My heavy drinking period really started when I was a student, I went back to university at 23 and ended up drinking four or five nights a week. I still managed to do well in my studies and graduated with a good degree, I also exercised regularly and was in pretty good shape, so that masked the fact that my drinking was out of control. I then had a job where I was working four days of twelve hour shifts, followed by four days off. I stopped working out during this time and started to gain weight. I would basically drink for the whole four days I was off work, and when I was at work I was counting down the hours until my four days were over and I could drink again. My drinking has tapered down a bit since moving to a more standard Mon-Fri job, but It’s still too much and I haven’t got back into regular exercise or lost much weight.

I really want to stop my drinking for myself; for my physical and mental health, I’m getting older and I really need to start taking better care of my health, exercising and getting into better shape, alcohol will only get in the way of that. Also for my wife; she isn’t a big drinker and I don’t want her to have to be sober around drunk me or have to adapt her life around a drunk or hungover husband. I also do all the driving in our household, I have never and would never drive while under the influence, but I’m scared that one day there will be an emergency where I need to drive, but can’t because I’m drunk. Above all I want to stop for my future kid(s); I don’t want to be a father who ever puts alcohol above his kids or allows his drinking to interfere with being a good and present father.",5,1768998902.0,stopdrinking,3,0.86,False

I woke up earlier than usual, not because of an alarm, but because the street outside was already active. Instead of going back to sleep, I stayed in bed for a while and scrolled through emails that had piled up overnight. Most of them were the usual online shopping mail order confirmations I didn’t remember placing, shipping updates, and a few newsletters I keep forgetting to unsubscribe from. One of them was from Alibaba, just another generic update sitting between everything else.

Eventually I got up and made breakfast, which was nothing special: toast and eggs. I realized I was low on coffee, so I grabbed a can of shark energy drink from the fridge instead. It’s been sitting there for a while, and today seemed like a reasonable day to finish it. I drank it slowly while standing in the kitchen, watching the kettle boil even though I didn’t end up using it.

After that, I spent some time reorganizing a drawer that mostly holds random cables and old receipts. It didn’t really need organizing, but it passed the time. I checked my phone again and cleared a few more notifications, including more online shopping mail that had come in while I wasn’t looking.

The rest of the day didn’t change much. I sat at my desk, opened and closed a few tabs without committing to anything, and occasionally looked outside. Nothing noteworthy happened, but the day still moved along at its own pace, which felt fine.",10,1768998881.0,BenignExistence,4,0.92,False

But now I’m a mum - 1 toddler 1.5yrs, SAHM. New to the area and hoping to stay and settle now I have a family.

I just can’t seem to make mum friends though. We do library baby classes and have done a couple of soft plays. A lot of the mums go for coffee together after and I wonder…did they know each other before having babies or met through the class? Because I seem to find it hard to build a connection.

Me and my kid are polite, friendly, dress normal, say hello, my kid is a happy kid…but I don’t think I put myself out there. I’m usually just so involved with my kid and what he’s up to. Always occupied in being a mum. I’m often very tired or looking for those quiet’s moments too. Maybe that shows?

I also have the typical mum brain and when I overhear conversations I feel like the only mum who has it. Maybe I need to have more adult conversations about things other than babies to get my brain functioning normally again.

Gabriel’s “tech to art” detour proves it.

This week's guest on the @PossibLaw podcast, @Gabriel Saunders talks about his grit, and entrepreneurial mindset, so you can learn to persevere.
He is a Senior Solutions Consultant & Legal Operations Strategist at LegalSifter and in a wide ranging conversation we discuss what happens when a lifelong builder brings curiosity, technical fluency, and high agency into legal ops, turning it into a true force multiplier. We unpack how real innovation with AI actually works, how to spot vendors that are all sizzle and no system, and why “wait and see” is basically volunteering to fall behind.
Plus we give you actionable guidance like this. Check it out.

Gabriel didn’t burn out and disappear. He went to coffee shops and drew, then fell into an artist rabbit hole for two years. But the builder part of his brain never turned off, so he built a system around a painfully common invisible constraint:

So he and a crew of artists started a nonprofit (Art Monkeys Incorporated) that did the unsexy work:
• Front the cash to print real inventory (prints, mugs, shirts, canvases)
• Create a distribution channel through convention relationships
• Run a year of support selling at Comic-Cons and similar events
• Optimize for one outcome: replace the Starbucks paycheck

That’s the point most people miss about “following your passion.”

Weekends away, scenic campgrounds, planned stops, everything neat and predictable. What I did not expect was how different it would feel once I decided to live in it full time, especially during the moments that were not Instagram worthy.

The first night that really hit me was in a quiet rest area just outside a small town. Nothing dramatic happened. No breakdowns, no bad weather, no scary encounters. It was just me, the RV, and a long stretch of darkness. I parked, leveled as best I could, and shut everything down for the night. When the engine noise faded, the silence felt heavier than I expected.

Inside, every sound was louder. The soft ticking of cooling metal. The faint hum of the fridge kicking on and off. Even my own movements felt amplified, like the RV was listening to me. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, realizing that this was not a temporary stop anymore. This was home now, wherever I parked it.

What surprised me most was not fear, but a strange mix of vulnerability and calm. There was no solid foundation beneath me, no walls that had been there for decades. Just tires, thin panels, and trust in my own preparation. At the same time, there was something grounding about knowing everything I needed was within arm’s reach.

The next morning, I stepped outside and made coffee as the sun came up. A couple of other RVs quietly rolled out, everyone nodding to each other without words. That was the moment it clicked for me. RV living is not just about travel or freedom. It is about learning to be comfortable with simplicity, uncertainty, and small routines that anchor you no matter where you are.

I still have days when I miss a traditional house, especially during bad weather or long stretches of driving. But that first quiet night taught me something important. RV living is not about escaping life. It is about carrying it with you, one stop at a time.",0,1768998525.0,RVLiving,3,0.3,False

The biggest bottleneck for any product-based startup today is **Creative Assets**.

You can have the best product in the world, but if your Facebook/TikTok ads look like 2010 PowerPoint slides, you're burning money. On the flip side, paying an agency $500-$1000 for a single UGC video is a massive risk when you're still testing your market.

I decided to build a technical solution to this: **AdSpark Creative**.

**The vision:** Give every entrepreneur the ability to generate ""performance-ready"" video ads in 2 minutes for the price of a coffee.

**How I built the ""Machine"":** I didn’t want to build just another wrapper. I spent months orchestrating a complex pipeline:

* **Analysis:** Scraping product data to find the ""angle"".
* **Generation:** Using [Kie.ai/HeyGen](http://Kie.ai/HeyGen) for high-quality visual avatars.
* **Rendering:** Implementing FFmpeg via WebAssembly so the heavy lifting (rendering) happens in the user's browser, keeping the SaaS costs low and scalable.

**I’m at the stage where the tech works, but I need ""Founder Feedback"":**

1. As an entrepreneur, what is the #1 thing that stops you from running more video ads?
2. If you could ""spawn"" 10 variations of a video for $20, would that change your testing strategy?

**I’d love to get 5-10 founders from this sub to try the platform for free.** Drop a comment about what you’re building/selling, and I’ll DM you a link with free credits. I’m looking for brutal honesty on the output quality.

The AFL’s most senior spin doctor has gone to ground over explosive new court claims surrounding the Luke Sayers “dick pic” saga.

Veteran crisis manager Sharon McCrohan, who recently joined the AFL as its new executive general manager of corporate affairs, was engaged by Mr Sayers 12 months ago to help contain the fallout from the posting of a male appendage on his social media account.

It was revealed on Tuesday night that the former Carlton president’s wife Cate had lodged a bombshell Victorian Supreme Court defamation writ, alleging that her estranged husband had made false claims about the incident in a statutory declaration submitted to the AFL integrity unit.

The sworn statement was relied upon by the Sayers camp and the AFL to clear the then Carlton supremo of wrongdoing.

According to the AFL’s official investigation verdict, the high-profile businessman’s mobile phone had been “compromised” by an undisclosed third-party.

Ms Sayers was apparently never contacted as part of the AFL’s probe, but in filings with the court, she alleges that her husband falsely implied that she was the third party and that he had made damaging claims about her mental health to help exonerate himself from the scandal.

Sources close to Ms Sayers say she strongly denies allegations she was responsible for the posting of the image and was appalled and distraught by the implication.

On Wednesday, McCrohan failed to answer questions over what involvement, if any, she had in the drafting of the statutory declaration or in assisting Mr Sayers in his dealings with AFL investigators.

Mr Sayers also drafted in top lawyer Leon Zwier to represent him in the probe.

It’s the second controversy to hit the AFL this week after the emergence of details surrounding the sudden pre-Christmas sacking of long-time government relations manager Jude Donnelly.

The Herald Sun revealed on Monday that league chief executive Andrew Dillon had summoned Donnelly to a Hawthorn cafe in December and informed her that AFL chairman Richard Goyder wanted her “gone”.

The Donnelly sacking has angered many within the football industry.

One club figure said on Wednesday: “These episodes show a lack of leadership and a weakness within the administration”.

The Supreme Court took the unusual move on Wednesday of marking the Sayers file as “restricted”, refusing public access to the documents.

It is unclear whether Ms Sayers or her legal team have obtained a copy of the statutory declaration provided to the AFL.

The day after the “dick pic” photo emerged on Mr Sayers’ X account along with the handle of a female executive of health insurer Bupa, one of the CFC corporate sponsors, he exclusively told the Herald Sun he had been “hacked”.

Away on a family skiing trip in Italy where he has a second home in Lake Como, Mr Sayers said he would “leave no stone unturned” and would aggressively pursue all avenues to discover who had uploaded the image.

Ms McCrohan had previously advised Mr Sayers during the parliamentary inquiry into the PwC tax leak scandal.

After Mr Sayers made his initial statement, all future communication was then directed to and dealt with by Ms McCrohan.

Carlton announced Mr Sayers’ resignation just moments before the AFL cleared him of any wrongdoing based on “the available evidence”.

When Mr Sayers stood down as Carlton president, a photo was leaked to Nine newspapers showing the former PwC boss having coffee with Ms Sayers in the Italian town of Lucca.

McCrohan emerged to prominence as a crisis communications expert in the late 1990s as a senior staffer to former Victorian Labor premier Steve Bracks.

She has also worked for former federal opposition leader Bill Shorten, the CFMEU and former Collingwood president Eddie McGuire.

“I love the game, the passion it inspires and its unique power to unite people from all walks of life,” McCrohan said after her appointment to the AFL last year.

“The opportunity to help shape and drive that engagement and contribute to the growth and diversity of the AFL industry, is a real privilege.”

The AFL announced on Wednesday that Dillon and league executive Walter Lee were travelling to India for a week on Saturday as part of a plan for the game to “establish a foothold in one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing sporting markets”.",6,1768998327.0,AFL,5,1.0,False

1qiwi7p,https://i.redd.it/578kml104peg1.jpeg,Lattafa Yara pink Eau De Parfum,"**Personal Wear Context**

I grabbed this one mostly out of curiosity after seeing a lot of mixed chatter online. Sprayed it on during a lazy weekend afternoon — just casual jeans and a tee, errands, coffee run, that kind of vibe. No fancy setting, just seeing how it sits in everyday life.

**Scent Evolution**

**Opening:** Immediate sweetness — a creamy, sugary vibe with light citrus freshness in the back. Some folks compare this to fruity desserts or strawberry-ish cream, though it doesn’t scream real fruit to me; more like a perfume-ified candy cloud.  ￼

**Heart:** After 10–20 minutes it settles into a soft floral-gourmand mix. Heliotrope/orchid and tropical accords feel powdery and lightly floral, with that sweetness still present but more refined.  ￼

**Dry-down:** Vanilla, musk, and subtle sandalwood come forward. The sweetness becomes more milky/powdery than overtly fruity, and it feels almost like a cozy fabric-softener vibe at this point.  ￼

**Longevity, Projection, Sillage**

Longevity varies quite a bit by wearer — on me it lasted 4–6 hours, fading into a skin scent. Others report weaker performance or longer wear, so this one seems pretty dependent on chemistry. Projection starts moderate but drops to close to the skin fairly quickly. Sillage overall is gentle rather than loud.

**Season & Occasion Suitability**

This feels most at home in spring and summer, especially daytime casual settings. Its soft, sweet, and airy character makes it well suited for coffee dates, weekend strolls, school runs, brunch, etc. It’s not the most formal or intense choice, so evenings or events where you want to make a statement might call for something bolder.

**Comparisons**

Compared to other sweet/floral budget fragrances like Lattafa Yara Candy, the regular Yara Pink leans less intensely sugary and more balanced toward floral-powdery sweetness. Think of it as sweeter and softer than a basic floral, but not as dessert-heavy or gourmand as some of the Candy variations.

**Pros**

Very feminine, soft, and cozy — easy to like for fans of sweet/floral blends.  ￼

•Transitions into a pleasant powdery vanilla base.  ￼

•Casual and easy to wear daily.

**Cons**

•Longevity and projection are inconsistent across noses — some find it fades quickly.  ￼

•Sweetness and synthetics may be too generic or “body-mist” like for picky noses.  ￼

•Not super distinctive or unique — more of a cute everyday scent.

**Neutral Final Verdict**

Yara Pink is a gentle, sweet, powdery floral-gourmand that works well as an easy, everyday perfume if you enjoy soft, feminine scents. It’s not the most complex or long-lasting fragrance out there, but it does what it sets out to do: smell pleasant without demanding attention. Some will love its cozy vibe, others might find it too generic or fleeting — both reactions are totally fair.

**Discussion Question:**

For those who’ve tried it — do you think Yara Pink smells more like a floral powder or a creamy sweet dessert on your skin? Why do you think opinions are so split on this one?",1,1768998242.0,nisbahAU,0,1.0,False

1qiwi1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/indieperfume/comments/1qiwi1f/4160_tuesdays_tester_set_review/,4160 Tuesdays tester set review,"I’ve been getting into fragrance for a while and recently decided to seek out more indie brands. When I came across 4160 Tuesdays I was really intrigued by their ethos and the scent stories that they’re telling.

I ordered the Pick Where you Like tester set, so got to pick 8 2ml testers from across their entire collection (love this idea btw, wish more brands did it).

I chose the following and wrote down my thoughts and I thought I’d share!

Figs in White Chocolate - This is a really creamy scent. Heavy on the white chocolate. I get the green tea as quite a sharp top note before it settles down into a creamy, woody slightly floral. I don’t get much peach, but do get ripe earthy figs. This feels like a very sophisticated gourmand, possibly too sophisticated for me! 

Hammersmith Tea & biscuits - This is one of the ones I was most excited to receive but I can’t quite get onboard with it. It’s very biscuity without being sweet, there’s a real toastiness to it which is nice. I think I was hoping for more of the lemon and ginger in the description, I get a bit of lemon but there’s an almost soapy note to it. It drys down very quickly on me and I can barely smell it on my skin. 

What I did on my holidays - This does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s one of the few fragrances I’ve smelt where I actually feel like I can smell each individual note. I get the mint come through as the strongest note with the lavender not far behind. The coconut suntan lotion and seaweed are definitely there but are more muted. It settles in to a pleasant sweet, salty, minty vanilla. Really fun scent, that’s definitely nostalgic of a British summer holiday. 

Captured by candlelight - I think this is my favourite but I’m probably biased because it smells like a delicious Christmas pudding. The toffee and cognac top notes come through strongly. Overall it’s sweet and boozy but the oak and hazelnut notes give it real depth. 

 

Dark queen - I don’t normally like ouds, but the rest of the notes sounded so up my street that I thought I’d give it a go. Turns out I still don’t like ouds! The opening is a nice muted but complex fruity smell. The description promises animal and it delivers. I kind of get the smell of stable on the dry down… but a very nice one that’s been recently cleaned with some berry cleaning products

The darkest bloom - This is nice enough but doesn’t wow me. I was really pulled in by the description that it was based on a mythical flower from a book and they were aiming to make “most intoxicating fragrance you can imagine”, each to their own but I don’t think this is that! The fruity top notes are nice and it does have a rich sultry feel to it as it dries down. It ends up being a woody/resin-like smell on me. I felt like I smelled like a sexy mahogany desk. 

Midnight in the palace garden - I really get the blood orange and the mulled wine from the davana paired with the almost herbal floral notes from the geranium as the top notes. The dry down is very woody, but with a hint of spiced mulled wine. I don’t get much coffee or vanilla. This has quite a strong incense smell. To me this fragrance feels like going to midnight mass on Christmas Eve.

Freeway - I was very intrigued by this one. The gasoline note is challenging, but it does calm down as the Jasmine and palm flower notes come through. There’s orange blossom in there as well. I tried this on a paper strip first and the smell of gasoline/ burning rubber stayed quite strongly but this performed much better on my skin and it settles down into a slightly sweet scent warm with the florals but the gasoline stays in the background. On reflection as much as I like the smell of petrol I’m not sure I actually want to smell like it myself. 

They very kindly also sent me Lavender rice as well. I wouldn’t normally reach for a fragrance where lavender is the dominant smell but this is quite nice. I get the blackcurrant and rice notes. It’s definitely a modern take on lavender. 

Overall I’m really impressed and am planning on getting full sizes of ‘What I did on my holiday’ and ‘Captured by candlelight’.

I’d love to hear if anyone has any suggestions for similar brands I should try next! ",3,1768998227.0,indieperfume,0,1.0,False
1qiwi0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1qiwi0e/first_ever_dose_of_reta_05mg_48_hour_update/,"First Ever Dose of Reta (0.5mg) – 48+ Hour Update, Appetite Suppression Is Very Real","So it’s been more than 48 hours now on my first ever dose of Reta, Monday morning, after probably six plus months of knowing what Reta was and ignoring it, not really being curious about GLP-1s or Ozempic, since it’s been all over the meme sphere, South Park, and the media over the last couple of years. I just didn’t care.

Probably last year, from about June until November, I was on a super good health kick, eating great every day. Then inevitably I descended into the abyss around November when I went on a small trip with my girlfriend, and that turned into 60 days of eating absolutely everything and anything, including getting back on the alcohol.

I’ve undone a bit of progress, but don’t get me wrong, I’m still much further along than I ever was in terms of composition. I’m probably currently around 20-something percent body fat. I haven’t checked the scales for a couple of months, but I’m probably floating around 80 kg.

So I said to myself, if I’ve gone off the wagon over Christmas again, I’ll have a go at Reta.

It’s now been 48 hours since I jumped on the Reta train at 0.5 milligrams.

I’ve read all the posts across the internet and forums where people say you need to start on 0.5 or you’ll die and your arse will explode with diarrhea and you’ll vomit out your organs. On the other end of the spectrum, people say if you don’t start on two milligrams, you’re not following trials and you won’t see any results.

So I was deliberating between starting on one mg or 0.5. I’m not usually so careful with these things, but I did start on 0.5mg.

The first day I felt absolutely nothing, dosing on the morning of Monday. I wasn’t expecting to feel anything.

I also flipped the internal switch and decided I was going to get off things like grazing on sweets and chocolate all day. That’s a habit I entirely kicked last year from June to November, when I did lose some weight and started getting compliments. I know how to train and how to eat natural yoghurt, chicken, and healthy food consistently.

But the last couple of months I’ve gone absolutely wild, especially with chocolates over Christmas. I got into the habit of constantly visiting the fridge to eat whatever was available. If there wasn’t anything I wanted on one visit, something would become the thing to eat on the next. That’s just how it goes.

Twenty-four hours after the 0.5 dose, I became suspicious. I wasn’t feeling very hungry.

I do take Elvanse as prescribed for ADHD. I’ve stopped taking it recently to have a break, but also to clearly see how my appetite is, because ADHD medication is a clear appetite suppressant. I’m not on it right now.

Yesterday my appetite suppression felt similar to how I feel when I’ve taken Elvanse, which made me think, is this placebo? Can the placebo effect reduce hunger? Can I literally not be eating food because I know I’m taking something that’s meant to stop me eating?

It felt strange because I would usually still have a plate of food in front of me. I’d still be at the fridge even if I thought the medication was working, especially considering I’ve been eating absolutely everything and eating out a lot over the last couple of months.

It got to the point where we went for fish and chips at lunchtime, then a few hours later I found myself in Nando’s UK eating chicken. That had me swearing at myself. I was sitting at the table enjoying the food but also thinking this is fucking ridiculous, spending this much money in one day on takeaways. Regardless of affordability, it’s reckless.

At around 24 hours in, I had a plate of chicken and vegetables and found myself more playing with it than eating it. I wasn’t very hungry. I could eat it, but I didn’t really want to. Normally I inhale food.

I went through the rest of the day slowly.

Later in the evening I went to the gym, and driving home I passed a place that sells some really nice sweet treats, Percy Pigs from Marks and Spencer’s. I thought that would be nice.

I realised I was still craving sweet things, but I didn’t stop and buy them.

Now it’s well past 48 hours. It’s Wednesday, probably 55-something hours after the first 0.5 mg subq dose.

I reached into the fridge after my morning coffee and pulled out a large pot of Greek yoghurt. Very good macros, probably 300–400 calories for the entire pot.

In this phase of eating, an entire pot is usually a lovely treat to start or end the day. I feel zero guilt eating a whole pot. It’s high protein and fits perfectly.

I’m just looking at it. It’s sitting beside the bed. I’ve had a couple of mouthfuls and I haven’t even managed to eat half of it.

At this point I’m no longer thinking this is placebo. The appetite suppression from 0.5 mg is definitely real, contrary to me expecting nothing.

I don’t know if I’m maximising the effects of Reta at 0.5, and I don’t want to spark a massive debate about increasing dose. Plenty of people say to stay at 0.5 for four weeks before moving to one. I genuinely don’t know.

I wasn’t necessarily chasing appetite suppression because when I’m locked in, I can stay locked in and eat well. I was more interested in the other effects, including the glucagon side.

But at this rate, I’m thinking about starting to track calories. Not to stop myself eating too much, but to make sure I’m actually eating enough, because the last thing anyone wants on this journey is muscle loss.

So yeah, 0.5 mg is clearly doing something. Taking a pot of yoghurt out of the fridge and not being able to smash it is not normal for me. This has gone from a quick snack to a morning project.",8,1768998225.0,Retatrutide,8,0.9,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
