1mxnn5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1mxnn5e/heres_your_one_quick_fix_to_get_over_your/,"Here's your ""one quick fix"" to get over your limerence for good, by someone who in fact literally just had a massive dose of reality.","I've always been an extremely limerent person.  Ever since middle school, I have had crushes that lasted years and were essentially psychologically debilitating.  When it hits—and it hits frequently—it presents itself almost as a serious depression.  I physically cannot get out of bed because my thoughts are consumed by them.  I see their face in my breakfast, on my ceiling, next to my houseplant.  I stop pursuing anything I'm interested in, because I'm literally so addictively consumed by the fantasy of kissing them, hugging them, or seeing them smile.  And I have been practically dying, begging, and pleading for a quick cognitive fix, something to get me out of this psychological hellhole, because it's been an extreme suck on my entire life.

I recently met someone who I went on a few dates with.  Because of my psychological predispositions, it is essentially impossible for me to date multiple people at once.  Naturally, I became completely consumed by him, unable to leave bed or do anything healthy and productive, despite the fact that I had a massive, high-stakes exam in the near future.  I could not read, I could not study, or even just leave my room to make breakfast.  I wasn't even really fantasizing about some perfect person or some perfect marital life.  So when people told me I was just imagining a 'perfect person' that wasn't the real him, it just didn't really hit.  Even Dorothy Tennov's book didn't really effect me, because even if I knew that all of this was just fantasy—that didn't make any of it go away.  

All I wanted was to be held and caressed, and that was all I thought about.  So with enormous anticipation, I always looked forward to seeing them again.  

Unexpectedly, on my fourth date with this person, he not only revealed that he was seeing other people, but that he was not interested in pursuing a long-term relationship with me for reasons entirely outside my control.  

It finally occurred to me that for so much fantasizing about being deeply held and caressed, I had emotionally invested so much in a man who could not similarly invest in me, and for reasons I literally could not fix.  My psychologically debilitating limerence that lasted for months amounted to **a massive fucking waste of time.**

And that is the only real lesson I can share with all of you.  The 'one quick cognitive fix' that solved my limerence was....experience.  Growing up.  At some point, it suddenly hits you how much time you've lost thinking about people who simply cannot meet you where you're at.  And that is a kind of experiential knowledge that can only be gained by living.  Genuinely, I do not believe limerence can be 'solved' my some sort of cognitive reframing of reality, but through the experience of rejection.  As Ottessa Moshfegh once wrote, ""Rejection, I have found, can be the only antidote to delusion"".  

My advice: If you're limerent over someone right now and really want to get over it, I suggest you literally just ask them out or inform them about it, so you can move on.  When it happens again, you repeat the process, again and again, until you can deeply intuit how misplaced infatuation really is.  And then you will stop feeling it, so intensely.

A guy I used to be extremely, unbelievably infatuated over just asked me out to get coffee.  In another life, I would have plunged right back into obsession.  Now it has really emotionally resonated with me how much I have deeply lost being so consumed by other men.  Now I see how much *richer* life really is when I invest in myself and my friendships, instead of imagining about being hugged and held by men who only later end up rejecting me.  Now I will only choose the man who actually shows he wants me.  I refuse to ever commit to a man who has not demonstrated that commitment in the long-term.  ",2,1755910075.0,limerence,2,1.0,False

also i cant respond to respect from people i dont trust because their compliments could be fake and designed to hurt me, so i just have to walk away or tell them to shut up because that way, i couldve “avoided a catastrophe” as my brain calls it

i also dont like when people ask me what music i listen to because i listen to some rock subgenres and if i mention one, theyre gonna start playing that music every time im with them, and so, i ignore them

also i wont stop thinking about going to my local dunkin and getting my morning coffee and having a conversation with someone and their friend comes running behind me and tackles me, tossing or spilling my drink on the floor and the daymare ends with bashing my bleeding head on something

1mxngyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1mxngyw/how_do_you_cope_when_your_closest_friends_dont/,How do you cope when your closest friends don’t understand your social anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I would say it is a pleasure to be here, but I guess all of us would prefer not to have to be on this board :/

First of all, I apologize if I do something wrong, but I am very new here. I need to vent, and I thought this would be a good place, with understanding people, where I could do that, even if I end up just shouting at the wind. And also thank you if you read this all the way through, it turned out much longer than I intended it to.

A little context: I (40 F, not a baby) always had some social anxiety of one kind or another, but it got much worse around 5 years ago. I started therapy for it \~3 years ago, and while I have made progress, I am still far from where I ideally wish to be. Comparing myself today vs. 5 years ago, there is a huge difference, and I am definitely doing things I would not have done then a lot more comfortably. Still, I occasionally experience some critical episodes, which make me feel awful. They come across as huge setbacks, and I feel like a loser, especially because these usually happen around people (what else, huh), and I can get the sense that my friends are getting sick of it.

I do not have many close friends, but the people I consider my two best friends are incredibly extroverted. Let us call my best friend Barb and my second-in-command Sophie. So it is very rare for me, if I want to hang out with them, to be able to get some one-on-one time. They are always doing stuff and surrounded by other people, so I have slowly pushed myself to accompany them in that, be more open to getting to know others, and have actually met some great people along the way. The thing is, when I am with them in a context where they keep doing this for days on end, I get to a point of exhaustion and meltdown.

I will refer to a specific example, which is what brought me here in the first place. Last week, Barb, Sophie, and I, plus a few other friends (8 of us, total) booked a 5-day stay at a house so we could go to a music festival nearby. I was wary of how I would react 5 days in a house with 8 people (more so than with the festival), but I tried to do a ""social diet"" of 2-3 weeks of not meeting anyone or doing anything social before the festival to gather strength for those days. And for the first couple of days, everything was golden. I was having fun, concerts were great, whenever I started feeling overwhelmed, I told them that I was going to take a little break and sit by myself with my phone, and I was successful in managing things that way. I consistently felt good, funny, chatty, like a good person to be around. 

On the third day, I started to waver. On the fourth day, I woke up in reasonably good spirits, but as people woke up and we started gathering on the house's balcony, I started shutting down. Having nothing to say, just looking around, feeling the anxiety starting to take over. I had to leave the balcony, I went to my bedroom, and suddenly had a huge cry. It just bubbled out of me. Then I felt too embarrassed to go back out of the room. Eventually, a couple of my friends came over briefly to give me a pep talk, but I felt awful; I was bawling, and by this time, intrusive thoughts were already circling in my head. All the negative things about myself you can imagine. I felt kind of desperate. I did not want to ruin anyone's day, and I still wanted to see the concerts at night, so I decided I would get some sleep and try to pull myself together. I took something for the anxiety and slept for around 3 hours. I was hoping I would be home alone when I woke up to collect myself before heading to the festival's venue, but surprisingly, almost everyone had taken a nap and was still there. So no alone time.

I headed out with them to the festival. Well, this day was sold out, and it was crowded as hell. I generally don't like places with a lot of people, and despite this being open air, and maybe because I was already vulnerable, this immediately concerned me. Still, I tried not to show it. Me, Barb, and Sophie went for dinner, we caught the first concert of the night (which was beautiful), and I felt as good as possible, taking into account my state, I guess.

But then, other people started popping around; friends of friends of friends, I was getting dragged by Barb and Sophie to meet X, Y, and Z, until a certain point where I just could not do it anymore. I told Barb I was going to sit down by a bar and stay there a little while. Once I did, I immediately felt tears welling up, but I thought, ""Well, once these friends are on their way, maybe I can talk to \*my\* friends and let them know how I feel, and maybe explain I have to leave"". But that did not happen. Once that group left, Barb and Sophie immediately wanted to go meet another group. They came to tell me that. I said, ""Sorry, I don't want to go, I will just stay here and wait for you"". I thought that would be it, but then it turned out those friends were coming to meet *us,* and that I could simply not handle. At the moment, it was like someone suckerpunched me in the gut. I was feeling my personal space invaded and, generally, I was feeling uncared for. I started shaking. Barb asked what was going on. I said I had to get away, she asked if I wanted her to come with me, and I said no, because I did not want to take her away from where she truly wanted to be (which I knew to be true). I just turned my back and basically ran away. I had to make my way through waves of crowds until I could find a little corner for myself, and when I did, I sat down and just cried for like 30 minutes. No one came to check up on me except a security guard who reached out to ask me if I was OK. Meanwhile, the next concert had started, and I knew they would be watching, so I just decided to leave and make my way back home alone. I texted Barb to warn her, and off I went. I immediately went to bed, but needed to be on my phone for like 4 hours to calm down enough to sleep.

The next day, I was exhausted, everyone was tired and grumpy, but Barb especially would not talk to me. She avoided me all day until we left the house. I came back to my home, cried some more. On Monday, I texted her and Sophie to see if they could maybe give me a call when they could, so I could take things off my chest. Note that they **do know** I suffer from diagnosed social anxiety, and this has not been the first time this happened with or near them, but I feel the need to make them understand where I am coming from, especially since they are so wildly extroverted; their understanding is sometimes lacking. Sophie called me on Tuesday and we had a nice conversation. I was feeling very raw still, so I cried all throughout the phone call, and while she told me some difficult truths, she was always considerate, supportive, and loving. Barb, whom I consider a sister, not only texted me rather shortly, but also called me on Tuesday night, super mad. She said my attitude was terrible, that she was feeling exhausted and angry from putting up with me, that I brought her down and basically ruined her Saturday because she feels responsible for me, and I am not in control of myself and bring her down with me. She acknowledges I have made progress since I started therapy, but she is frustrated that I am heavy, that I make her feel this way, and that I am a burden. It was very hard to hear. I was crying on the phone, and she did not let up. She told me I do this every 6 months or so, that she feels targeted because she is the person closest to me, and this always happens around her, she is left to pick up the pieces, and she is tired. Like I do it on purpose. I got out of that phone call feeling like the worst human being in the world.

I have not talked with her since. I am giving her the space she wants. But I feel very, desperately alone. I can't make myself understood to my friends; they can't for the life of them get themselves in my headspace and understand that sometimes I get triggered by things that for them are not only completely normal, but desirable (huge groups, loads of people, small talks, stuff like that). I am also offended that Barb outright told me that if I *had* asked her to come with me when I was having the meltdown on Saturday night and took her away from her other friends, she would have been pissed.

I know it is not easy to deal with someone who struggles with this stupid condition, but I feel like it is unfair, especially because I have been doing all that I can to accompany her and Sophie in everything and everywhere they want me to be, but they very rarely compromise anything for me. I love these girls beyond words, but I feel like I sacrifice a lot of my well-being to just partake in their aura, whatever little they can afford to give me. They very, very rarely make time for us to just chill and watch a movie, or go have a cup of coffee, or just chill the three of us. It's always party, party, party. Even when we start out doing something quiet, it always turns into a shindig with loads of other people. I think under the circumstances, I have been dealing with it great, but it is cumulative, it wears me out and out and out until it all bubbles up one time.

My greatest fear is that if I don't sign up to this way of doing things, if I don't show up consistently, I will stop getting invited; I will lose them and never see them again. And I will isolate again and retrocess once more.

It sucks to feel that I cannot be real with my closest friends. Barb ended up saying this does not change anything in our relationship, but it does, because now I feel I cannot be honest with her and tell her how I feel, nor can I rely on her to be a safety net if I need her. She asked me to tell her how I was feeling throughout the week, but I am feeling like shit, and of course I am not going to tell her that after she has complained how much of a burden I am and how bad I make her feel.

At this moment, I feel like I am losing my friends, and I literally do not know what to do. I get their frustration, but I also think I am not out of line for expecting a bit more from the people who I let in, who are closest to me (something I have a lot of trouble doing in the best of times).

This is so isolating. People have no idea of the effort it takes to show up and be a part of their lives. I turn on all of my social skills whenever we have plans together. I get along with most of their friends, but they do not understand the huge effort this entails, the toll it takes, and how it ends up spilling over once we reach a breaking point. This time, a combination of too many people + too many days + crowds + lines + heat did me in. I was not expecting to be chastised for it.

I wonder if something similar happened to any of you. How do you deal with this? Do the people around you understand you? Do they accommodate your needs? How can I express what I need better? How can I make them understand what I feel and that I'm not throwing kiddie tantrums, but genuinely suffering? I do not want to stop being around them and going out and having fun, but I would like to also be chill and hang out just the three of us and having them understand that it is not because I do not like their other friends, it is because I do not function well in large groups and it really takes a toll on me if that's what we do every single time. I know I cannot ask them to change their personalities, but is a happy medium possible?

Would love to hear any of your takes on this. And stay strong out there. ",2,1755909594.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1mxndlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/equestriaatwar/comments/1mxndlt/equestria_at_war_rereview/,Equestria at War. Rereview,"Can I recommend this mod to other players? Yes.  
Can I recommend this mod to my past self? Well… Probably yes. A tough recommendation, but still a recommendation.

In short. This mod needs a lot of work. Like A LOT. And the work shouldn’t be about adding new focus trees, but fixing the broken ones(most of them).  
  
  
  
/This is a positive review.  
  
/Even though it’s positive, I know there’ll be tons of comments like “bro, get skill issue, just learn to play”, “good story bro”, “mod’s just not for you, happens”. My reply to those in advance: go duck yourself.

/The only reason I’m leaving a positive review and not a negative one are the Changelings with their world-war challenge, and the high quality of the writing. From a balance perspective this mod is worse than any other mod, and even worse than vanilla, which at least didn’t throw constant surprise game-overs at you with dumb mechanics.

**+**

1. **The story.** The main reason why this review is positive. The quality of the writing is excellent. Yeah, some parts are better, some worse, but overall the text is way above average, which makes me very happy since I’m a huge fan of text and words. Yes, sometimes there’s boring purple prose, yes, the mod often dumps a billion characters with new names, tells you their whole backstory and then pretends the player remembers every little detail about every faceless guy. There are elements of verbosity and slight tedium, but most of the writing is done in a very good style: detailed enough, without unnecessary fluff, and it was genuinely interesting to follow the stories—even when those stories didn’t really have much depth.
2. **Graphic design.** Everyone looks beautiful, and even with the clear difference between some of the styles, it doesn't come across as negative.
3. **No bugs.** I didn’t run into a single bug. Everything worked exactly as the creators intended. Even if that intention was terrible, it still worked as intended. Well, except for the Changelings... and the puppet trade resetting. Sure, I had like 2–3 crashes, but they seemed random, not tied to the mod itself. Reloaded the autosave and it all worked fine again. Those crashes didn’t affect my impression.

Technically, it’s flawless. The mod doesn’t glitch like vanilla or most mods, even when you play for absurd amounts of time. And up to the end date.

**–**

1. **Game design and balance.**

This mod is either unbalanced, unplayable thing that’s theoretically impossible to win unless you know all events beforehand (sometimes even then), or it’s braindead-easy bullshit you can beat with your eyes closed. The only middle ground is the Changelings vs Equestria war, which is very tough but absolutely doable and fair… Oh, wait, no — half the world joins against you out of nowhere. And Bear protectorate suddenly flips communist without any event. Oops. Guess that doesn’t count. But if you ignore that, then yeah, it’s fine.

Technically, you could probably fix this with the right difficulty settings, but it’s all too unstable to know in advance what difficulty to pick. So I always just throw on Elite with production buffs, since I’d rather restart after my own mistakes than die of boredom from enemies being too weak.



# Country reviews

**2/5 Wingbardy.** Disappointment. Too easy.  
  
On the official site they write “Italy except strong”. Nope. It’s Italy except boring. Dull events, painfully dull wars against countries that can’t do anything to you, and that you win by just drawing a battleplan, walking away for coffee, and coming back to victory.  
I fully played the Supremacy path, did every focus, and yet I can’t remember a single character or interesting event from the entire run. Except Mussolini. And even then only because he had cool artwork.

**5/5 Hippogriffia.** Fantastic. Best country in the mod? Playing to the very very end.  
  
Colthage didn’t join the war, so I easily crushed Hippoterna. The war with Aris was so easy I thought it’d just be another lame war fest. I was wrong.  
Then I went communist. Big drop in quality after the first focus — lots of events but no actual gameplay, and the text wasn’t great. The Hippogriffian communist path was more interesting. But still, the “let’s find aliens, let’s be friends with dolphins” kind of events were dull.  
Still, the country opens up into tons of cool projects, a badass reactor system, nuclear weapons galore, fun new content, and an amazing concept of going to war with the whole world and playing until the end date.  
This was the most fun I’ve ever had with anything HOI4-related. I still remember prepping a global naval invasion for two years to take down the continent-conquering Changelings.  
  
Tons of dev effort is visible. Writing could be better, but overall best path.

**4/5 Changelings.** Cool, but what’s the point of the postwar path?  
Six games. Five losses, all on historical. Good run. The funniest was the fifth: I figured out I was losing because of my overstacking tanks, invented a new tactic, thought I’d finally win — and then managed to lose to Olenia, which I usually stomp without effort.  
Big plus: the text quality. Maybe the strongest writing in the entire mod. The prewar and postwar both were a joy to read.  
Focus tree is great too. Especially the filler “weapons” branches. Like “here’s a war with Equestria, want to fight? If not, enjoy some +100% research bonuses.”  
And it was fun! Even waiting 35 days for a pointless bonus with no event was exciting, because I was preparing for war with Equestria at the same time.

Now the bad:

* Stalliongrad suddenly joining the war against you without any event — not cool. Especially since normally you always get “X is justifying war” warnings. And since Stalliongrad often controls half the continent, it’s double not cool. Attempts #2 and #3 were lost only because of this.
* Puppeted Bears suddenly flipping communist with no event — triple not cool. They were my puppet, I was building stuff there, then bam, communists. Shouldn't someone have asked me?
* The postwar path. If you ignore the best writing in the mod, this is the worst gameplay content in the entire mod. It’s like they abandoned it halfway. Resistance suppression stays stuck at 0/5 and 4/5 with no way to finish. There’s a softlock with the “love system” that just randomly appears — and while you figure it out, you’re already sitting at -150% stability and -150% war support. My love level was -6.488. I spent months deleting divisions slowly, instead of wiping them all at once. So what of it? Game over? i cant pick some focuses with this love level. And i can only raise it with focuses or political power. No political power income. Supposedly I was supposed to take love monthly from all ponies in Equestria, but that never happened. Couldn’t even raise it to -6.0. Had to cheat — I’d gone too far to restart at that point.

**1) Everfree Forest — the worst war I’ve ever seen in a mod.**

* Impossible if you didn’t take the exact focuses beforehand(i didnt pick train focus).
* Impossible if you didn’t stockpile political power. I had -200 because Chrysalis screwed something up and I got debuffs.
* I guess there’s some hidden god-known order of choices in the events, but none of my picks worked.
* The war itself feels like bugged-out garbage from a 2000s strategy game. Units don’t move, they leave captured territory, you have to manually stop them to recapture, enemies have immortal units that my 48 tank divisions couldn’t kill.

Overall: suffered, stressed, but thankfully it ended fast. Still burned into memory forever — unlike Wingbardy (who is these guys again?). 

2) **But what’s the point?** Story-wise it makes sense. Gameplay-wise? Why was I building mothership fleets, producing tanks and armies — for what? So the game could pat me on the head and say “good job, now pick a new nation”?  
Same issue with Chiropterra, where the postwar focus tree sets you up for conquest — then just ends. 

**3/5 Lunar Empire.**   
  
Story: interesting.  
Gameplay: I’m supposed to defend against Changelings after a long bloody civil war, starting from scratch with half my territory stolen. How exactly am I supposed to win that? Probably by rushing the civil war, abusing mechanics, speed-capturing cities. If you play “normally,” I don’t see how it’s possible. Not fun.

**2/5 Skyfall.** Cut one path from any country and give it to Skyfall.   
  
Who thought it was a good idea to split Hippogriffia’s content into 6 failed branches, while giving Skyfall nothing?  
A nation trading with the whole world, a money system, an interesting leader. And what do we get? A lazily slapped-together focus tree with the highlight being a Breaking Bad meme, and then only decisions for wars. That’s it.  
  
I’ve already written more symbols in this review than Skyfall has content.

**1/5 Crystal Empire.** Overall a very flavourful nation my ass.  
  
Wiki says: “Overall a very flavourful nation.”  
Reality: Pick Sombra’s path, get like 1.5 real events. Read character descriptions like “Unknown who this dude is.” Close the game right after beating Equestria in 1011, because the content is gone.  
Only interesting bit: you can marry Chrysalis, Nightmare Moon (who never appears), and another pony I didn’t know. Could’ve been cool — dual rule mechanics, fun events — but nope. Not even events. Too bad.

**3/5 Griffonian Empire.**   
  
The writing is naive. It's not the worst, and in some moments it's even very good, but Grover VI acts a bit too one-dimensionally.

Two playthroughs: in one, for some reason, almost all of my neighbors declared war on me. I played the Duchess's path on historical, and it was a huge surprise I didn't expect. I don't like surprises, especially those kinds. I even have a screenshot from the start of the war, where I'm in the center with 60 divisions and everything around me is red.

The second time I chose the Archon's path and prepared for this war the entire game, but it never happened. In the end, the playthrough felt like the Wingbardy path: just another easy war on top of another easy war.

My impression was slightly improved by a decent war with Wingbardy, who controlled half of Griffonia and some Zebrica, which was interesting, but still not too difficult.

Ultimately, I can't say I was impressed. Well, like, it's okay, but I'm sure that as soon as I uninstall Hearts of Iron 4, I'll instantly forget this playthrough, as if it never even happened.

**1/5 or ?/5 Star Father.**   
  
Okay, so to play him, you slog through three long civil wars, destroy your nation, and when you finally get Star Father in power, you get a new focus tree, do a few focus… and then Hippogriffia, five times your strength and tech, declares war and crushes you.  
  
Uh. And then what?  
  
Who the hell balanced this? I’d love to talk to them. How is a nation that went through three civil wars, reset research, divisions, stockpiles, and has only existed for a year supposed to fight a continental giant that already destroyed Chiropterra? What’s the logic? Surely it wasn’t designed to work like this?  
I created 0 world tension, and still got war declared on me by a “harmonious” country.  
So I’m supposed to restart? Redo those three fricking civil wars, one of which is blatantly unfair, just to get wrecked again the moment I form a country?  
I must be missing something. I refuse to believe it was meant to work this way.

Also, the only example of truly bad writing. Pointless verbosity and word salad with no depth. Can’t say more since I didn’t get far — Aris flattened me too fast.

**3/5 Abyssinia.** Timers, instant event-based game overs, only one “correct” path. Just add auto-deleting saves and you’ve got a full bingo of bad game design.  
  
Newest nation, so you’d think it’d be polished and up to date. Nope.  
  
Lots of timers, none of which are actually achievable\^  
Nobles: if you abolish slavery, they go into disloyalty with no way to bring them back.  
If you *don’t* abolish slavery, the famine is unfixable.  
The famine: unfixable unless you let the ruler go insane. If you do, you eat -200 political power and game over, because noble decisions become impossible.  
  
I’m sure there’s some exact focus order, precise political power management (don’t spend a single point, don’t hire anyone, I hired a military advisor…), and other hidden tricks that lead to success. But that requires 2–3 identical runs, because it’s not intuitive at all. And the harsh timers punish you with game over just because you didn’t play exactly how the devs pictured in their head.  
Yes, I saw the warning. I followed it.

The premise is fantastic though, I’m genuinely interested in the ruler’s story, and maybe after some psychological recovery I’ll try again. But gameplay-wise? I just ate shit and threw several hours of my life into the trash.

Oh, right, there were also the **Jaddari. 3/5.** Pretty fun, but I didn’t finish. The nation is just too strong, and it’s endless primitive wars for the sake of endless primitive wars. Got boring by the end.

**Summary:**  
  
If I had to pick one emotion to describe my experience with this mod, it would be **disappointment**.  
Yes, I enjoyed many parts of it, read some great stories, and this is a *positive* review. But the dominant emotion is disappointment, and nothing else even comes close.  
  
Whenever I start enjoying something, making progress, the mod immediately slaps me with some absurd bullshit that completely cancels out my experience — and I stop playing, not thinking about the cool story they (tried to) tell me, but about what a piece of shit it all was.

As I said, this is a positive review, and even though I honestly disliked most of the countries, I will definitely come back to this mod. But I’ll need a year or two to psychologically recover from the atrocious game design — and from the hoi4 itself, which by the end just started to wear me out.

1mxn6il,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxn6il,2025 X3 review,"I have now had  my X3 for several months, so here are my thoughts….
I need to start by saying I spent a long time looking for a new car. I have knee problems and it really bothers me when I am seating for a long time. My only concern when looking for a new car was comfort. I did not care much about the kind of car or the price. I tested the seats of most cars. Fords, Toyotas and Mazdas all were at the bottom of my list. I also needed something that could pull my boat, so my choices were started to look slim. Pick ups were kind of ok, but their seats are designed for someone much larger than I am. I am over 6 feet, but about 180 lb. My top 3 choices were Subaru (Outback), Volvo and Bmw. The thigh extender was a must for me. 

I am very happy with my choice. I put a picture of the seat because for me that was it. I was sold. Very comfortable even for long drives. We did a long trip to Florida from Illinois and back in 5 days for a college visit and I never thought I would do that. Very hard for me to do a long trip on a Cx-9. The handling can’t compare. On my way to work there is a hill with tight corners with a 35. I could go 55 on the Mazda. Maybe 57. The X3 can do 10 miles an hour more without feeling it is going to fall apart. It’s impressive. 

The X3 is perfect for my daily drive. I usually put the cruise control that keeps you in the lane and enjoy my coffee. The gas milage is awesome. I put a picture. 36 mpg since factory. Some of you are probably wondering if I I bought it at the top of Mount Everest and drove it to the center of the Earth. Yes, you are correct. Now, seriously. I usually get 40 mpg. Even with stop lights or the boat I can get about 30. Yes, an X3 with a boat gets the same as a GLC without the boat. I must confess I am one of those drivers who keeps the fuel consumption on the screen to see if I can beat it. But I did the same on the Cx 9 and could barely get 20. I regularly get 650 to 700 miles per tank as long as it is not on a long fishing trip. Again 36 mpg on a car that pulls a boat about 10% of the time was not expected. The screens and voice control are nice. I did not like not having buttons for the temperature,etc at first, but now I like it. It’s like when I got my first iPhone. 

Now the nonsense from Bmw. Why did they go with a sun screen from Walmart?  The interior has several parts that look like they are from Great Value. The sun screen will probably work for you the next time there is a solar eclipse. Your grandma’s car from the 60s probably has a nicer one. Same goes for the handle to open the door. The engineer who designed the cup holders was probably fired after copying the design from a child’s picture in a napkin. 

Honestly if my biggest complaint is the cup holders and sun screen, that just tells you how happy I am with the car. I love the comfort. It is amazing. If you are looking for a comfortable daily drive watch or h amazing handling, this could be the one. ",5,1755908772.0,BMWX3,0,1.0,False

1mxn4m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mxn4m9/liddle_lady_sunflower/,Liddle Lady Sunflower,"Every now and then you get that snap picture of just how small the world really is. It’s one of those times when you’re halfway across the world and recognize a guy from the gym, or you spot your childhood crush ahead of you in the line at the DMV. I’ve moved a lot, and lived a lot, and these things happen to me every now and then. So when it does happen, I don’t always think much of it.

Until not too long ago, I lived in a small townhouse. I worked as a shift manager at a component factory in northern Pennsylvania, not too far from Pittsburgh. It wasn’t anything fancy, mostly compartments and storage for snowmobiles and tractors. Honest work, but it took quite the drive to get there. Almost fifty minutes by car, one-way.

But I had a great place. It wasn’t big space-wise, but there was a great open floor plan that made the place feel three times bigger than it actually was. Two floors, two bathrooms, two bedrooms, and a living room with an adjoining kitchenette. Perfect for a bachelor, or a small family. The only problem was the bedroom door, which could jam if I closed it too hard.

 

I was coming back from a bad breakup. My ex and I had been talking about moving in together, but we just couldn’t make it work. She had these anxieties that kept her from really committing, and she ended up second-guessing herself to the point where I was no longer part of the conversation. After a while we simply had to accept that she had no idea what she wanted; but she wasn’t in a place to be with me either way. I accepted a transfer up north, along with the promotion, and wished her the best.

I’d been living up there for about a year when, one morning, I noticed someone moving in across the street. It was nice not to be the newest guy on the block anymore. I only saw glimpses of the owner. There was a woman standing outside on the lawn, pointing at two movers and trying to direct them with a voice that could barely be heard outside her own head. It was like watching someone trying to tow a car with a rubber band.

 

By the time I got back home that night, there was still furniture on her lawn. I decided to be the good neighbor and head over, see if she needed any help.

She was doing her best to tip and angle a three-seat couch by the time I got there. She wasn’t making it through the door on her own. I waved at her.

“Excuse me,” I said. “You need any help?”

“It’s fine,” she said. “Thank you, really.”

“You sure? Looks like you need to angle it and pull sideways, that’s a rough one-man job.”

She rolled her eyes and let out a sigh. She nodded in quiet resignation, and less than a minute later, the couch was on its way through the living room.

 

It’s always a bit eerie to move into a new place. Everything looks so barren that you can hardly imagine it being a space where people lived, and breathed, and laughed. For the time being, this woman’s life was all boxes and bare floors. Every step echoed off the walls. I helped her with a couple of boxes before she let her guard down. She had this short brown hair that sort of clung to her sweaty face, and these deep pockets under her eyes. I could tell she hadn’t been sleeping a lot. There was a shake in her hands that showed she’d either been skipping meals or was deathly nervous.

After carrying in some of her kitchenware, she stopped me at the door and forced a smile.

“Sorry,” she said. “I’m Julie.”

I introduced myself, shaking her hand. She was definitely trembling.

“The movers screwed you, huh?”

“Yeah, they were only paid to dump it all on my lawn, it seems.”

“Sorry to hear that. Looks like you’re almost done though.”

“Yeah, but the unpacking’s gonna take a couple days, but it’s nice to get settled.”

There was something about her voice that seemed familiar. An accent. It reminded me of my own. Then it just kinda clicked - I knew this woman.

 

Julie and I had gone to the same school. I hadn’t recognized her. She used to be the tallest girl in class. Then she’d just sort of stopped growing, while the others kept going, making her the shortest girl in class over the course of about two years. Now that I thought about it, it had to be her. It was obvious. I’d had enough of a crush on her not to forget that face anytime soon.

The moment I recognized her, it was like she recognized me in turn. She let out a huff and looked me up and down.

“I can’t believe it,” she laughed. “What are the odds?”

“Julie. You wanted to be a teacher, right?”

“Yup,” she nodded, “And I am.”

“And you had these apple earrings,” I said, gesturing. “They were the size of golf balls.”

She couldn’t hold back a snort and stepped away, crossing her arms.

“You went out with James,” I added. “Man, haven’t seen him in years.”

Her smile froze in place. She nodded, rubbing her shoulder in a self-hug. I noticed she had a wedding ring.

“Yeah,” she said. “Good times.”

 

She excused herself and thanked me for the help. She offered me a twenty for the trouble, but I waved it off. She insisted, but I’d made my mind up. She ushered me out the door.

“I gotta check on Danni,” she said. “She’s been awfully quiet.”

“You got a kid in there?”

“Yeah, my girl Danni,” she smiled. “Four years old. She’s in her room, she’s had a rough day.”

“Well, tell her I said welcome to the neighborhood. And feel free to drop by sometime.”

“I’ll do that.”

I wandered off, only to stop halfway across the lawn, I looked back, only to see her still leaning against the doorway.

“You still got those apple earrings?” I asked.

“No,” she said, shaking her head. “Times change.”

It was a stupid question, but I couldn’t help myself. I waved goodbye, and that was that.

I caught myself glancing out the living room window a couple of times before I headed to bed that night. I could see Julie in her window, putting up decorations. A couple of framed pictures. Curtains. A couple of lamps and candles. And finally, a pot housing a tall, blue, sunflower.

Unusual.

 

I’d had a huge crush on Julie in high school. I’d thought about asking her to prom, but James got there first. I ended up going with Margie H, who was more interested in using me as a dress-up doll rather than a boyfriend. There was a lot of “do this, it’s cute” and “don’t do that, it looks weird”. She ended up spending most of the night with her friends across the room. James and Julie, on the other hand, only had eyes for each other; slow dancing under the disco ball to all the greatest hits of the 90’s.

But there seemed to be no James around anymore. Perhaps it was just like she’d said, times change. But looking back at that night, I couldn’t imagine the two of them apart. Not for a moment.

I tried not to bother Julie and her daughter for a couple of days. I thought about heading over to say hi someday, but I figured they needed some time to get settled. I was probably over-thinking it, but I didn’t want to give a bad impression right off the bat. It’s one thing to be helpful, it’s another thing entirely to be creepy about it. And you don’t want to mess things up with someone you’re gonna see across the street for years, maybe decades to come.

I wondered about her daughter, Danni. I was yet to actually see her. I had to leave for work so early that I’d never Julie take her to daycare, and by the time I got off work they’d already come back home. Julie wasn’t letting her play in the front yard. Then again, maybe that was by design. You don’t want your four-year-old to run amok near a busy road.

So I tried to keep my curious eyes to myself and focus on my own life. But after months of empty inboxes and being ghosted on apps, you start to cling to whatever light in the dark you can spot. And I couldn’t help but to think that maybe a light had moved in just across the street.

 

One day, as I came home and browsed my mail, I noticed a letter addressed to Julie. She had a different last name. It took me a while to connect the dots; she had James’ last name. Given how she had a wedding ring, I couldn’t help but consider that maybe they were still together. Either way, I had a misplaced letter to deliver.

I made my way across the road and knocked. Julie opened, holding a phone to her ear, talking to someone. I handed her the letter in silence, and she rolled her eyes apologetically at me. She wasn’t in a very enthusing conversation on her phone, apparently. She mouthed ‘thank you’ back at me. As I turned to leave, she put her phone down for a second.

“Hey, would you mind helping me with something?”

I turned to her, raising an eyebrow.

“I need some help with Danni’s room. I’m useless with electronics.”

“I’ll give it a go, sure.”

“Thank you *so* *much*. Drop by tomorrow around seven if you can, alright?”

“Tomorrow, seven. Got it.”

She put her phone back to her ear and waved goodbye. I just stood there for a couple of seconds, trying to catch a glimpse of her through the window; but the only thing I could see was that blue sunflower of hers. The thing was tall, and it always seemed to be turned your way, no matter where you looked. It was downright creepy.

 

The next day I went over to see Julie. My heart was thumping away in my chest a little harder than usual. I was trying to keep it cool and not get my hopes up, but there is something about an old crush that just taps at your heartstrings. I knocked on the door, peeking at the window. The sunflower was still there, and I could’ve sworn it was still turned towards me, even as I stood by the front door.

Julie opened the door with a tired smile. She had this pink blouse with white lilies and a pair of slightly too big jeans. She had some makeup on, I noticed.

“Just got back from work,” she said. “Come on in.”

She’d done a lot to the place. Pictures of her and James on the wall. All carpets were out. Birthday cards on the fridge, guest towels in the downstairs bathroom. She’d put in some work.

“You’ve been busy,” I said. “Is Danni doing okay?”

“Oh, yeah, better than me, that’s for sure.”

I looked over the wall of framed pictures. Julie and James at the Grand Canyon. Julie and James dressed up for Halloween. Julie and James at their wedding. James light hair was a nice contrast to Julie’s dark mahogany.

“I don’t see any pictures of Danni.”

“There used to be plenty,” Julie said. “These are the only ones we could keep.”

“Sorry to hear that.”

I looked at Julie, who nodded her head matter-of-factly. I could tell I’d struck a nerve.

 

She showed me upstairs and to the left. She was yet to put up any lights, so the corridor was a bit darker. There were these big yellow letters on the wall leading up to Danni’s room. She must’ve painted them by hand.

“Liddle Lady Sunflower,” I read out loud.

“I call her that all the time. The first time I said it I had this cold, so it came out as ‘liddle’, not ‘little’, and it just kinda stuck.”

“Now that’s cute.”

“Well, the liddle lady is with her aunt tonight, so she won’t mind us stomping into her holy kingdom.”

Danni’s room was as classically girly as girly things get. A well-made pink bed, pink curtains with white stripes. Toys and dolls and stuffed animals, picture books with horses, and nature, and cute animals. It was all very neat though. Either Danni was the most organized 4-year-old in the world, or Julie had taken some time to clean up before I got there.

 

There were a lot of little things to go through. Julie needed help running an ethernet cable along the wall. It took some time to set up, but it felt nice doing something with my hands. Then she had me change a couple of lights that she couldn’t reach. I didn’t ask her about it, but I found it strange that she wanted UV lights in her kid’s bedroom.

Julie brought out a couple of boxes; the final items on the agenda. Cameras.

“It’s just been me and Danni for a while now,” she explained. “I get nervous.”

“Hey, you’re the parent. Ain’t no shame in being careful.”

“I’m glad you understand.”

She had me set up two cameras in the bedroom. One overlooking the hallway, and one overlooking the bedroom window. I helped her set up the wi-fi and showed her how to access the feed and recordings. It was simple stuff, but not very high quality.

 

Having helped her out, she made me coffee and sat down to have a chat in the kitchen. We talked about old friends and memories, reminiscing about the times we’d talked as kids. But I could tell she was holding something back. Every now and then, she would completely shut the conversation down, instead focusing on the cup she cradled between her hands. Then, after a sip or two, she’d change the subject. Finally, I just had to ask.

“I’m sorry to bring this up, but I gotta ask about James,” I said. “I see him on the pictures, and you’re wearing the ring-“

“Oh. Oh!”

She snapped to attention, shaking her head.

“Right. Of course. I’m sorry, I thought everyone heard about the fire.”

I was halfway through an apology when she shushed me.

“No, it’s fine, really. It’s been months.”

 

She told me about the fire. They’d lost their home some time ago. This was the reason she didn’t have that many things to put on the walls; most of it was lost. Along with James himself.

“I didn’t even know he was still in the house,” Julie said, trying to keep a brave face. “I thought he was in the backyard, waving in the firefighters. I was out front with Danni.”

“I’m so sorry, Julie.”

“Feels strange to say it out loud. But that’s what happened.”

“It’s gotta be tough on Danni. Poor thing.”

Julie put her hand on mine and took a deep breath.

“Thank you,” she said. “You’ve been a great help.”

“That’s what old friends are for.”

“Right,” she smiled. “Friends.”

 

We said our goodbyes and I watched her close the front door. I could hear her wander back upstairs. It was dark outside, only briefly interrupted by the occasional passing car. People coming and going, paying no attention to the lovestruck man gawking at the widow’s front door. I snapped out of it, giving it one last look before I called it a night.

The blue sunflower was still there, in the window. I couldn’t help but to wonder; out of all the things she managed to save from that house, why did she save a houseplant? Her own husband hadn’t made it out, how come the flower did?

As I walked back across the street, a curious thought struck me. The camera that was angled at the window could probably see across the street. She could see me right now. Why do you need a camera for the second-floor window anyway? Especially for a window that can’t be opened. Wouldn’t it be better to have one by the front door?

 

Over the next few days, I met Julie a couple of times. I came over with a bottle of red wine as a late housewarming gift, and she came over with some leftovers. She made this mouth-watering sausage stroganoff that kept your stomach warm all day. She also made her own snacks, like peanuts and sunflower seeds; lightly salted and honey-roasted to perfection.

After a few weeks, it was rare for me to go a full day without seeing her. And yet, I hadn’t met her daughter. Danni was always busy with something. Sleepover at a friend’s house. Staying with her aunt across town. Going to bed early. There was always something, and I was yet to see a picture of her. I asked Julie if she could show me her phone once, and she promised she would, but she would change the subject and forget shortly after.

But it was hard to be suspicious, and even harder to care. Julie was getting comfortable in that house, and it showed. There was a glow coming back to her.

 

One day after work, there was a knock on the door. A longer one than usual. Slower.

Julie was standing there with one of my phone bills. The mailman had messed up again, and I reminded myself that I had to have a chat with them about it. Then again, I didn’t mind the inconvenience of having Julie over every now and then. At first I thought she was just coming over in a rush, but there was something to her demeanor that was different. She crossed her arms, but she wasn’t reserved. It looked casual.

“Did you enjoy the snacks I brought?” she asked. “Danni loves the roasted ones.”

“I’m a sucker for salty stuff.”

“What about sweets?”

I thought about it, nodding as I made a mental list.

“Depends on the sweet.”

She grinned at me.

“I’m kinda sweet.”

 

It didn’t take much more than a wink and a giggle for us to end up kissing. We made out on the couch as I fumbled for the remote control. I couldn’t get in the mood with a Judge Judy rerun going ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ in the background. Finally, as we made ourselves comfortable, I could let my heart go. Julie had this wonderful lavender shampoo that filled my senses, but there was something strange about her kisses. They had an almost chemical taste to them, like a tinge of ammonia. Maybe she just had a weird toothpaste.

Somewhere in the awkward fumble of eager hands and skin touching skin, a whisper reached the back of my ear.

“I’ve missed you,” she mumbled. “I’ve missed you so much.”

I didn’t know what to make of it. I think I tried to rationalize it as her wanting to be with me for a while. Or perhaps she really enjoyed our time back in high school. Then, another whisper.

“I’ve missed you, James.”

There was an awkward pause. We tried to laugh it off. She shook her head, taking a deep breath. She tasted the words for a second and leaned in close.

“Danni is with her grandma.”

I expected her to say something. Excuse herself, perhaps. But there was a trauma there, and we were both consenting adults – mistakes were bound to happen. One thing would lead to another, and Julie didn’t go home that night.

I don’t blame myself. I was lonely and stupid. Even before she moved in across the street, Julie had always been a bit of a girl next door in my mind. In one way, this was a dream coming true. But in another way, it just felt wrong. Nothing we did that night felt as true and honest as that one mistake she’d whispered into my ear.

*I’ve missed you, James.*

 

The next morning, I woke up in a daze. It felt like I’d had too much to drink, but without the headache. The world felt draped in cellophane. I woke up in my room, alone. Julie was lucky she got out of the bedroom at all; I’d slammed that door pretty hard, and the lock was finicky. Maybe she had a knack for it. I could hear noises coming from downstairs, so I threw on some boxers and a bathrobe and wandered into the hall.

I could hear Julie as she moved around some plates and glasses. And she was singing this tune, like something from a commercial.

*“You’re my friend, I’ll sing your tune. Setting sun, to rising moon. I ask you buddy, buddy blue – won’t you be a sunflower too?”*

It was strange. I’d never heard that song before, and yet, I knew the lyrics. I wandered down the stairs as Julie waved me to the table. She’d made grilled cheese sandwiches. I sat down by the table as she gave me a peck on the cheek. She handed me a plate and sat down next to me, cheerful as ever.

“I made your favorite,” she said.

“I didn’t know this was my favorite,” I smiled back. “Haven’t tried it yet.”

I picked it up and held it. Then, something cold ran down my spine.

 

These weren’t my plates, and these weren’t my glasses. She’d served orange juice, but I didn’t have any in my fridge.

This wasn’t my kitchen. These weren’t my windows. Not my chairs, not my tablecloth, not my *house*.

Julie looked different. My hands looked different. And as I was about to take a bite, this escalating pulse deafened me in my right ear, as a radiating warmth burst through in waves. My heart was terrified long before my mind was. And as my instinct screamed at me to run, I instead turned to my right. To the *third* chair at the dinner table.

A voice spoke to me. It cut through the cellophane of my mind. It wasn’t loud, but it enveloped my ears. The vibration didn’t come through sound, but through a pulsating warmth rattling my inner ear. A droning creak, more clicking than voice. Like someone smacking their lips and tongue into clicking little words.

*“It’s your favorite, daddy.”*

 

I dropped my plate.

I was sitting in my kitchen, alone. No Julie, no one to my right. Just my dinner table, across the room from my kitchenette. The clock on my wall showed that I had another 40 minutes before I had to go to work.

I couldn’t hear anything. It was like my ears had popped from pressure, and no matter how much I squirmed and turned, it didn’t pop back. I put my finger in my ear, and felt a blockage. I turned my head to the right and scratched, only to sense this mounting pressure on my eardrum. I had to resort to using a toothpick to open my ear up. When I did, dirt poured out of my ear canal and onto the dinner table. It was a lot.

I sat there for a moment, catching my breath. Julie had left a sticky note on the front door.

“Had to get up for Danni”, it read. “Talk soon!”

She’d signed it with a little heart.

 

I washed my ears, had a quick shower, and got ready for work. On my way out, I noticed the mailman. I was halfway to my car when I turned to him.

“Excuse me,” I said. “Can you make sure you don’t mix up our letters again?”

“Mix up who?” he called back.

“Me and the neighbor. I keep getting hers.”

“I’ve been doing these rounds 12 years, I ain’t about to mess them up now.”

“Well, you did. Several times.”

He laughed, shaking his head.

“I don’t think I did.”

 

That whole day passed in slow-motion. I had to stop a couple of times just to sit down. I’d get this pressure in my ears, like I was freediving at an uncomfortable depth. Sometimes I’d get these white flashes, like I was standing somewhere too bright. Little stings and burns, giving me the semblance of tics and twitches.

I forgot to bring my lunch, but one of the guys could tell I was having a rough day. He offered me a turkey sandwich. As I went to get it from the fridge, that pressure started to build in my ear again. But this time, as it swallowed my sense, a voice came through.

*“Mom made your favorite.”*

I turned to see the break room table covered in plant dirt with little green sprouts. Something bulbous moved just beneath the surface.

*“Mom made your favorite.”*

I held a fistful of sunflower seeds. The sprouts on the table were growing so fast they resembled spasming tadpoles, reaching for the fluorescent lights. And the bulbous growth kept getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

*“Mom made your favorite.”*

 

My fingers cramped so bad my nails dug into the meat of my hand. Blood mixed with the mush of a turkey sandwich between my fingers. I fell to my knees trying to force my fingers open, but it didn’t work. Two guys came running, trying to help me straighten my arm hand. They couldn’t do it without risk of breaking my wrist, so they had to sit there with me and wait for a paramedic to come. It took a shot of muscle relaxant to get it loose. They had me scheduled for a doctor’s appointment.

I was sent home early that day. I hadn’t taken a sick day since I started, so they could tell this wasn’t normal. Things look different driving home in the middle of the day; you never see the sun like that usually. There are different sounds, different cars on the road. Makes it all feel unreal, like a bad dream.

Coming home, I headed straight for the bed.

 

By the time I woke up, it was dark outside. Walking downstairs, I noticed a letter by the door. I must’ve missed it. There was a post-it attached.

“You didn’t hear me knock,” it read. “Just wanted to drop this off!”

I picked up the letter. Just a phone bill. Strange though, would the mailman really make that kind of mistake after I specifically reminded him? Did he do it out of spite?

No, that didn’t seem right.

 

I had a curious thought. When I helped Julie set up the camera in her daughter’s bedroom, she’d given me access to her wi-fi. I’d also set up the password. I had no intention of spying on her, but if one of the cameras caught the view of the mailman, I could see if he really messed up that bad, or if he’d done this to mess with me. The feed reset every 48 hours or so, so there’d be plenty of time to check.

I sat down with my laptop. I had to find just the right spot at the edge of the living room, but I managed to get a weak signal of her wi-fi. I typed in the password, connected to the camera, and rolled back the footage. I felt a bit bad about doing it, but there was no way she’d know. Sometimes we do things behind closed doors that we’re not proud of.

I checked the feed from earlier that day. I saw Julie leaving my house in the morning. I saw myself walking out, heading off to work, having a quick conversation with the mailman. I then saw him watch my car roll out of the driveway and walk up to my house; dropping a letter through the door.

 

That couldn’t be right. I kept watching.

Julie came back out of her house, holding the pot with her blue sunflower. She put something into my front door, and it swung wide open. She grabbed the letter, looked inside, and then entered. According to the feed, she was inside my house for over an hour.

She came back out, still holding the pot with the blue sunflower. She hurried across the road and back into her house. A few minutes later, I saw her inside her daughter’s bedroom, still holding the plant. I could only see her in the corner of the feed, caring for the plant. Watering it. Tending to its leaves. Then she turned on the UV lights.

I fast-forwarded. Slowly, I could see the sunflower turn. Not towards the sun.

But towards the camera.

 

There was a knock on the door.

I shut my laptop and got up off the floor. I peeked out through a window, only to see a strand of dark mahogany hair. Julie.

The next second, I was opening the door. I hadn’t planned on doing it, but I did. Everything looked brighter.

“Long day?” I asked.

I hadn’t said that. Not with my voice. Julie walked through the door with a tired smile. She gave me a peck on the cheek.

“I hate being a temp,” she said. “Claire won’t stop bugging me.”

“She’ll come around,” I said. “She seems like one of the good ones.”

I didn’t know what I was saying. I didn’t know any Claire.

 

We sat down by the dinner table. I don’t remember making pancakes, but they were on the stove. I plated and served them with a spoon of ice cream and some raspberry jam as Julie told me about her day. She talked about going to see people this weekend, about making plans with her parents. And after dinner, she kissed me. But not like she’d kissed me earlier; this was a real kiss. Like she’d held back the love.

“I love you,” she whispered as she pressed her forehead against my shoulder.

I looked up, catching a glimpse of my reflection in the kitchen window.

My hair looked brighter.

James?

 

I gasped for air as the front door swung open. I was wearing my bathrobe. It was dark. Julie looked at me, her eyes wide.

“Took you long enough,” she smiled. “Did you get your letter?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Thanks.”

“No worries. You okay? You look a little pale.”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t know what’s going on.”

“You want me to come in? I can make you some-“

“No.”

I answered before my brain could register what I was saying. Julie gasped, like I’d struck her. I could feel something bubbling in my chest as my heart raced.

“I want to see Danni,” I said. “Can I see her?”

“Sorry,” Julie said. “She’s at her friend’s house.”

“I don’t think she is.”

 

Julie’s wounded expression melted into a mild amusement. Like I was playing a joke on her.

“I’m sorry?”

“I don’t think she’s at her friend’s house,” I repeated. “And I don’t think she’s with her aunt, or grandmother. And frankly, I don’t think the mailman keeps messing up our letters.”

“What’s with the tone?” she asked. “Did I do something wrong?”

“Did you?”

Our eyes stayed locked for a couple of seconds. Then, something changed.

“You want to see her?” she asked. “Fine. I’ll get her.”

She stormed off across the street. My heart sank as I watched her pick the blue sunflower from her window and head my way, cradling it in her arms.

 

I slammed the door shut and backed away from the door. Seconds later, something metallic rattled into the lock, and the door swung open. She really was good with locks.

“Here she is!” Julie said, cradling the pot. “Don’t you recognize her? Don’t you recognize your daughter, James?”

“I’m not James!”

“I can’t believe it’s taking you this long.”

She walked inside and slammed the door shut. She put the pot on the floor. I backed away. As I did, she started humming that tune again. That melody.

*“You’re my friend, I’ll sing your tune. Setting sun, to rising moon. I ask you buddy, buddy blue – won’t you be a sunflower too?”*

 

Something ruptured in my head. My right eye went red and blind as a stream of blood poured out of my nose, burning my senses with a sting of copper. I closed my eyes, only for an unnatural vision to come out of the dark. How I backed away from Julie, in another place, in another house. Memory of a voice, but not my own, speaking from inside my mind.

“It’s not a *child*, Julie. We can’t keep living like this.”

“She’s *yours*, James. Everything that stands between you and this family is *you!*”

“I want to be a father, not a fucking *gardener!*”

Flashes of pain. Memories of tears stinging behind my eyes. Late night talks. Checking the bathroom trash to see if she was still throwing up sunflower seeds.

 

I was back home, making my way up the stairs. Julie was downstairs. The pot was still on the floor. Then, as I closed my eyes, I was somewhere else. I was a little bit taller, and my reflection had a lighter complexion. Brighter hair. There were pictures on the walls. Pictures of James and Julie, and a lot more. And in more than half of them, she’s cradling her blue sunflower.

“What are you going to do, James?” an echo yelled from downstairs. “Are we gonna keep living like this?!”

“I’m not doing this!”

“I want more kids!” she screeched back. “She needs a sister! A brother! And right now, she needs a *father!*”

“It’s not a child, Julie! It’s a fucking *weed!*”

“I *birthed* her!”

 

Blinding light. An operating room. Holding Julie’s sweaty hand as her nails dug into my skin. A terrified nurse falls to her knees, her hands are covered in dirt and blood. A doctor holds what looks like a blue walnut. It fits in the palm of his hand. It has a pulse.

I scream until my lungs ache, but Julie smiles.

A hundred nights of smashing pots and throwing that fucking plant in the garbage, only for it to come back brighter, stronger, bigger in the morning. Every touch and kiss from Julie came with that one nagging thought that she was just using me to bring more of them into the world. Every whisper a venom, cutting through my heart.

Until one day when I stand alone in our bedroom – with a lit match. It smells of gasoline.

“You’ll come back,” Julie says from across the hall. “She’ll bring you back.”

And I don’t care.

 

My eyes open. I’m crawling down the hall. I hear Julie walking around downstairs.

“Danni had me feed you a ton of this stuff,” she called from the kitchen. “I thought you’d be James by now.”

I looked down at an empty corridor. My legs hurt. I was warm, like an invisible fire choked the air. My hands looked different. Were they even mine?

There was a sound coming from the stairs as something moved.

The flowerpot tipped up from the top step. The blue sunflower swayed a little. In little stretches, it came down the hall, moving on its own. And from the bottom of the pot, something stirred. She’d cut out the bottom of the pot, allowing something to reach out.

The moonlight burned the image into my mind, as I saw the pallid arm of a 4-year-old child, pulling its way towards me.

 

It came closer. As I blinked, I saw the flames spread around me as a vision of Julie looked at me from across the hall – shushing the blue sunflower like an upset child.

I blinked again. The pot was closer. The sunflower was just outside my bedroom door. The deep navy blue of its petals rattled with excitement as white dirt-covered grub-like fingers pressed into the floor, pulling itself forward.

I was burning, and I was not. But I did exactly what James had done on that fateful day. Despite the fire, the pain, and the uncertainty.

I kicked the door closed.

 

It slammed shut with a bang. Something touched the knob, but it didn’t budge; The lock had jammed. Something pounded on the door, louder and louder, but it wouldn’t budge. I blinked.

“Then go ahead and burn!” Julie cried out. “Burn, James! She’ll bring you back to me, and it all starts over again!”

I blinked. The memory sounded different in my mind. I know what she’d said, but I remembered it differently, like I’d heard two voices at once.

“Then go ahead and hide!” Julie cried out. “Hide! She’ll bring him to me, no matter what you do!”

I had to do something drastic, but I was stuck. The window didn’t open. In that burning space in my mind, I heard the windows crack and break as the pressure from the fire burned my retinas shut. And in this place and time, I wrapped my hand in my bathrobe, and smashed my bedroom window. Two cracks in the glass echoed behind my ears.

Without shoes, or a shirt, or a plan, I tumbled out the broken window. And in another world, a part of me still burned to the sound of Julie humming that one tune, over, and over, and over.

 

I landed hard. I cut my leg and foot on broken glass. I lay there, watching blood pool around my ankles. The neighbor’s dog was barking; they must’ve heard the screaming. There was something moving in my blood. Tadpoles? Bean sprouts? Seeds?

Someone called out to see if I was okay. Someone that wasn’t Julie. And before I passed out, I saw her round the corner, looking my way. She wouldn’t have time to do anything. Her voice faded as my fingers ran cold, and my vision dark.

“She’ll bring you back, James. If not now, then later.”

She turned and walked away. And as she did, her blue sunflower turned towards me for a final time.

 

I think the blood loss saved me. It got out some of whatever poison she put in me.

She set her house on fire and disappeared that night. She left most of her things behind to burn. I was stitched up and took some time off work. Weeks later, I would still get these occasional flashes whenever I sat down at the dinner table. I’d see Julie, sometimes. She would laugh and smile. Other times, she would have her back turned to me, tending to her plant.

I moved out not long after. Somewhere closer to work.

 

It’s hard to pretend this didn’t happen, but it’s even harder to explain it to someone who doesn’t believe it. But I know what I saw. I know what I felt. For a moment, I was James – and if I’d been just a bit less careful, I would still be James. Maybe that’s all I’d be.

But a couple of weeks ago, I got something in the mail that proves I’m not out of my mind. It was an unsigned greeting card. Someone must’ve dropped it off by hand.

“Congratulations!” the colorful print read. “You’re gonna be a dad!”",2,1755908620.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

So I'm 29m. I’ve had some serious relationships, not plenty. In my last one, I was dating this 10/10 girl, funny, beautiful, hard-working, and open, but soon after we started sleeping over at each other's places (not living together yet), she started doing this men vs women role kind of thing. Now, don’t get me wrong, I've lived alone most of my life and do everything myself. I don’t need her to be a cook or maid. I think the whole point of a relationship is to care about each other. If I see you’re tired, I’ll do literally everything. If I see you hate doing something (for example, mopping the floor), I’ll make sure you don’t have to, because I’ll do it whenever it’s needed. But she always tried to do “masculine” things and kinda prove something—to herself, to me, or others? Idk.

For example, one time we were on vacation in Alaska (don’t ask why). There was snow on the driveway in the morning. She took a shovel and started cleaning it up. I dressed up and took a shovel too, and she yelled at me (not aggressively) that she would do it and please, if I could bring her a cup of coffee afterward. I was like: ok, let’s experiment. I watched her struggle for more than an hour to clean the driveway, exhausted, come back, and drink her coffee. I’m 6ft, 225 pounds; she’s 5’7, 150 pounds. I’m thinking to myself—I could do it in half the time with a third of the effort.

Every time I’ve tried to talk to her about stuff like that, she always gets defensive and we end up fighting. Eventually, we broke up for a lot of reasons, but I still don’t get why women try to break down stereotypes when nobody’s asking anything from them. Is caring for a person so bad that I should be watching roles and obligations in relationships? Maybe I’m overreacting, but I really want to see it from a woman’s perspective. 🤷‍♂️",0,1755908552.0,SeriousConversation,38,0.22,False

1. Loneliness is real… but temporary. The first few days can feel rough. Then, suddenly, strangers turn into friends over coffee or a bus ride.

2. You’re braver than you think. Figuring out a train system in a language you don’t speak feels like winning a gold medal.

3. Flexibility beats planning. The best memories often come from detours you never put on your itinerary.

4. People are kinder than the news makes you believe. 9/10 times, locals actually want to help you even if it’s just pointing you to the right bus.

5. You come home different. Not in the cliché “found myself” way, but in the small ways more patient, more resourceful, more open.

I've posted here before and had a few fun and interesting chats, but I'm still looking for a real connection. Anything real or worthwhile is hard to find in the sea of ""fakeness"" these days. That goes for real life and on dating apps. There's a lot of people who like to ghost and not say anything. It's unfortunate that a lot of people are so fake but I'm holding out hope that I can meet the right person either IRL or online eventually. :)

**About me:**

I'm a 30 year old average looking white dude with an average physique from North Carolina. I'm not hellbent on staying here either. I look pretty young and still get carded all the time, lol. College educated with a bachelors degree, a decent career in sales and own my own business. No debt or kids & financially responsible, but I love to have fun too.

I love camping/hiking and traveling! I think I've been to over 30 states! I love listening to music & playing PC games. I also enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks/podcasts. I would like to get a motorcycle at some point. I'm pretty easygoing generally. I'm also open to trying any new hobbies with my partner that they'd like to introduce me to. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too. One day, I'd like to have a house in the mountains with a few acres of land that is completely paid off. I've also thought about figuring out how to work from home and do the whole camper van travelling thing and work from my laptop. Have a streak of free-spirted energy in me I guess. I'm 420 friendly but I don't really partake with the exception of the rare edible a few times per year just to relax.

Honestly I am a pretty social and goofy guy. I would describe myself as an ambivert. INTJ, dry/dark sense of humor, I love making people laugh when I can. A bit nerdy at times, mainly about PC games and history.

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to connect with someone worthwhile and sane between the ages of 22-35 with no kids. Preferably inside the USA! I like text chatting but calling is ideal and better in my opinion. Obviously I don't expect you to call me right away but it's a much better way of actually getting to know someone. Which if we aren't doing that, then what are we doing?

I am a very dedicated and affectionate person in relationships, and really try my best even though I am nowhere near perfect. (Not even close.) I try to understand the other person I'm with to the best of my ability and be thoughtful and caring. I just want to find something peaceful with someone one day. I love hugs.

I want to be around someone who gives me peace and to be able to sit around a campfire with you sipping coffee and making smores or having a picnic having a deep hearty laugh. Maybe play video games together too. I'd love to feel completely comfortable around you. I would like to get to know eachother on a deeper level than ever before, if it feels right. I'd like to find someone who is okay with me showing emotions even though I am a guy. Someone I could take on cute dates and treat well. At this phase I am dating with intent. Honestly just looking for my best friend that I haven't met yet. 

I would like to one day find the person I am meant to be with, and if there are things wrong, we can fix them together hopefully.

Anyway, that should give you a good taste of what you're in for if you decide to reach out. If you like the sounds of any of this, shoot me a message and we'll chat. :)",1,1755908095.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I am Mel,  a Senior Moderator of r/AdoptMeRBX. After careful consideration, r/AdoptMeRBX’s Mod Team has decided to place a **Permanent Ban** on posts of big wins/WFLs without evidence of said trade. 

We have been removing posts of big wins without evidence of said trade for a while now under Rule 1: Abide by Reddit’s ToS || Vote Manipulation. However, we have recently gotten many mod mails wondering why their posts was removed. We realised that the removal reason for this specific removal is quite vague and has been causing a lot of confusion within the community as the removal reason was not clear.

**Do note that we still allowed posts of big wins as long as you include a screenshot of the trade.**

The reason why we decided to remove posts like these in the first place is because we have no way to verify whether or not these trades are real or faked if we do not have a screenshot of it. Many people have been taking advantage of this and posting trade of massive overpays (ie 20+ on elve) and farming upvotes from the community.   

If someone posts about a big win without proof of said trade, the post will be removed and OP will be reminded to post with proof of the trade. **Do note that OP will not be given a warning**. However, repeated offences of this banned topic might result in a warning.

I just moved to the city and don't really know anyone yet. I'm 22 and really just looking for someone to hang out with and explore the area. I'm an ambivert so I can be outgoing or chill depending on the vibe. I'm not really into nerdy stuff, but I love listening to music and getting lost in nature. I'm a big fan of large bodies of water, so if you're a lake or ocean person, that's a bonus.

I'm in the downtown area and would love to meet up for a walk or just grab a coffee. I'm honestly just looking for a friend to talk to. I've been pretty lonely lately and it would be nice to have someone to share a conversation with.

If you're in your 20s and looking for a friend too, send me a message! I'm pretty chill and would love to meet you.

Also, please don't be a weirdo. I was stood up last time I tried to meet someone and it was a bummer. I'm just looking for a normal, platonic friendship.

1mxmqxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FioreRicci/comments/1mxmqxk/a_rude_awakening/,A Rude Awakening,"Fiore woke up after an intense nightmare. Sleep was one of the things Fiore hated most. She got nightmares very frequently, and they tended to appear in two forms. They either include frightening imagery and sounds, or she's forced to relive her most humiliating and painful memories over and over again as if it was the first time. She was in her room, which was nice. While her parents were complete pieces of shit, her grandparents were quite nice. They were one of the few people who genuinely loved her, and they got her out of the boarding school and took her in. She walked over to the kitchen and got herself some cereal. It was Reese's Puffs. Not a bad option. Her grandma walked into the room.

""Good morning my little flower,"" Eva exclaims. She knew the meaning of Fiore's name, and how ironic it was considering her behavior.

""Good morning Grandma,"" Fiore replies. Fiore continued eating.

""Is there something wrong?"" Eva asks.

""I had another nightmare,"" Fiore answers.

""Oh you poor thing,"" Eva exclaims, ""You're having those more frequently than usual.""

""I know,"" Fiore replies, ""I've learned to live with it.""

""You're used to not caring about things,"" Eva exclaims. Eva then got herself some cereal as well. Her grandpa walks into the room.

""I'm glad we took you in,"" Lorenzo exclaims, ""How could my son and his wife treat you like that.""

""I know,"" Fiore replies, ""They never cared about me.""

""That's not how I raised him,"" Lorenzo replies back, ""Something snapped in him.""

""Maybe he just didn't want kids,"" Eva replies back.

""That's probably it,"" Lorenzo replies back as he got himself a coffee. Fiore then finished her cereal and got into the family room. Her Switch was sitting there, in its dock. She grabbed her pro controller.

""This is gonna be fun,"" Fiore exclaims. She booted the game up and selected Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. She selected Ness as a fighter and went into an online match. Meanwhile, Lorenzo picks up a photo of himself, his wife, his son Leo, and his other son Enzo from the past.

""What have you become,"" Lorenzo exclaims. He couldn't believe that his son could neglect and abandon a child like that. As Fiore continued to play her game her phone began to ring.

""Oh, what now?"" Fiore asks. Fiore then turns the game off and picks up the phone.

""Is this Fiore speaking?"" Derek asks.

""Yes, why?"" Fiore answers.

""I've got an offer for you,"" Derek exclaims, ""See, we're planning another season of Disventure Camp and...""

""Sign me up,"" Fiore replies, ""I'll do it.""

""Really? It's that easy?"" Derek asks.

""Yes,"" Fiore answers, ""Maybe I'll win this time. I hope so.""

""OK. I'll see you at Soluna Island,"" Derek replies. He then hangs up.

""Are you really willing to do this again? You know how it went last time?"" Eva asks.

""Grandma,"" Fiore answers, ""I'm 10 years old now. I'll be starting puberty very soon. It's gonna be completely different this time. I know it.""

""You've always been this reckless,"" Eva exclaims.

""I consider it a strength, not a hindrance,"" Fiore replies.

""OK,"" Eva exclaims, ""Me and Lorenzo will be rooting for you from here.""

""Yeah,"" Fiore replies, ""I'm glad that more people care about me now."" She then heads into a room and looks at the photos on the board beside her computer. One of them was with Alec during Season 1. She hopes he was there. At least he didn't hold a grudge against her.",2,1755907588.0,FioreRicci,2,1.0,False

1mxmoyd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxmoyd,Big room available in Bed-Stuy apartment,"I have a room available in my Bed-Stuy 3-bedroom apartment for September 1st!

The room: $1,200 for a 14.5x8.5 sq ft room, with a window and good sized closet.

There’s one bathroom, a good size kitchen (that can accommodate multiple people cooking at once!), plus a living area with dining table, comfy sofa, and TV.

We’re two easygoing working women in our 30s, looking for roughly the same! We keep fairly standard office work schedules, keep a clean apartment and are quiet. Ideal roommate is likewise clean and quiet but open to a friendly chat in the shared kitchen or movie night on the couch.

We’re located in a really great part of Bed-Stuy, walking distance to grocery stores, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, shops on Tompkins Ave., and Herbert Von King Park. It’s a 7-min walk to the Kingston-Throop C train (15 minutes to the A at Nostrand), and about a 20-minute walk to the Bedford-Nostrand G train.

Looking for someone  to sign onto the one-year lease! Message me with a little info about yourself and I’ll be in touch. ",1,1755907433.0,NYCapartments,1,1.0,False
1mxmnxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mxmnxw/apathy_and_future_perspective/,Apathy and future perspective,"Lately, my days have been even more apathetic than usual. I’ve been too lazy to hit the gym or stay consistent with my diet like I used to. I don’t really feel joy in my achievements or progress, just relief. Video games used to be the one thing that always gave me something good, but I haven’t played in two years, so now I don’t have anything that brings me genuine pleasure.

Recently, I’ve noticed that as my apathy has grown, my sense of the future has shrunk too. I do have ambitions, like building a career in my dream profession and owning one of those coffee machines with more than ten brew options, but that’s pretty much it. They feel like little fragments of a dream inside an otherwise empty movie.

I can’t really picture myself living a full life, turning 30 or 40; having a peaceful life with friends and someone by my side. None of that feels satisfying when I think about it. I don’t feel like dying. Back in 2022 I used to have almost daily suicidal thoughts, but those have gone down a lot since early last year. At the same time, I don’t feel any joy in continuing to live either. I don’t know where this is going. I want it to end without actually ending.

Does anyone else ever feel this way? like not wanting to live, but also not really wanting to die?

Trying to legally change it would be inconvenient and I know most of my family would refuse to acknowledge it, so I’ve never bothered going that route. I just prefer going by the nickname. 

As much as I don’t like the idea of meeting people online, I work in a female dominated industry and work with kids, So, there’s not a lot of social places I meet adult men. 

I’ve been using my nickname on my dating profile, and since it’s easy to guess my full name, guys generally start using it right away. The part where I don’t know if I’m being an a-hole, or coming off like one, is when I correct them or ask them to use my nickname, they seem put off more often than not. Occasionally someone will ASK if my full name is X, and I’ll say yes, but I prefer Y. Those guys tend to be LESS put off, but I think that’s probably less than 25% of the people I start conversations with. 

Just this week I’ve had too different guys fully lose interest in the conversation the second I asked them to use my nickname, and I don’t THINK I was being a jerk about it. One guy actually wanted to set up a coffee date which I agreed to because the conversation was going well, and he said “Cool, I can’t wait to meet up with you Elizabeth” to which I replied “Me too, and I prefer just Liz if you don’t mind.”  

The guy then goes “oh wow ok” and hasn’t followed up since.

I don’t think it’s THAT strange to go by a nickname and be vocal about preferring it, so I’m not sure if I’m delivering the message in a way that comes off as nasty or aggressive. I’ve really been trying to be kind about it, but I’m also not sure why it’s offensive to other people in the first place? 

I can see why I might be the AH because I can understand maybe feeling snapped at or not liking to feel “corrected”. Like I can understand maybe not feeling great about having someone go “um, ACTUALLY-“ 

But at the same time, it’s just a personal preference, it doesn’t really affect them and as much as it seems like a silly hill for me to die on, it seems like a weird hill for them to die on as well? 

I’ve been in relationships where they bulldozed over this preference entirely because my partner thought my full name was pretty, and I always disliked that they did it but I guess I had a “whatever makes you happy” attitude about it. I guess it doesn’t MATTER what I’m called, but it feels like a respect thing to me and I’m really kind of surprised at the pushback I’m getting. ",4,1755907302.0,AITAH,5,0.83,False

If you're someone who is working remotely, struggle to work due to environment issues like me.  
Hear me out!  

Their environment is very clean, thoughtfully designed (**many** **locations feel like a 4-star hotel lobby)**, and **filled with people who are focused, respectful and professionals.**

* **Complimentary perks:** Unlimited coffee, tea, and soft drinks all day. Fresh light breakfast (Ex: pastries/ fruit/quiche/ charcuterie) at 9 AM and snacks at 2 PM daily.
* **Weekly happy hours** on Thursdays.
* **Clean, quiet spaces:** Plenty of clean private phone booths for calls or meetings.
* **Travel-friendly:** Access to global locations (Europe, California, New York, and more) with your membership.

I have **one open co-working membership** available as part of my plan and I’m looking for a **responsible person** to join as my teammate at a **30\~40% discount off retail pricing**.

* Retail price: $430/month + $99 for global access (different cities, countries) = **$530/month**

* Unlimited visits during business hours.
* Full access through the app with your own login.

To the girl from Riverside that I fell in love with and left me with no note 
Hey, I heard your dad died and that really broke my heart for you 
Heard that you were so depressed that you tried cocaine when you said you wouldn’t do that anymore because it’s how your best friend died and never got to say goodbye 
Sorry for all the grief that you felt even while we were together from all the loss before me
I’m sorry that you never let your walls down completely because you’re afraid to get hurt again 
I think you’re afraid because you know I wouldn’t do that 
I wonder about you often 
I don’t wish you any ill 
I think I just wanted you to know that I’m thinking about you 
Now I think about that time we walked around Bass Pro shop and you saw the scopes and you thought they were silencers, and how for about 30 minutes we looked at those disgusting fish in the tunnel and all I could really think about is wanting to hold your hand and make you laugh
I remember we tried the camping MREs for dinner and I think we got some really horrible Chili
And then later that night you ended up going to get Chinese food and it turned out to be an actual restaurant where you go and sit down and eat instead of like the restaurants back home in California that just pile up the Togo box I found a location that does that by the way anyways there was  a huge thunderstorm that night you went and played in the rain and you called me and we were laughing in that moment I just wish I was with you.
Remember that time when we were at work and I found out that you haven’t changed your oil in months maybe almost a year thank God it was a Toyota engine. I went to my car because I always carried extra oil and I put it in and it was bare bones, dry 
And then the next day I went to pick you up for work, but we ended up just ditching work and we slept close on the couch and while you rested, I went to take the car to get an oil change and then I cleaned your car and I got us coffee And then we spent the day not being at work
I still think about you and and all our other memories that I hold close. I hope you finally changed the oil.

If anybody sees this from back then, I'm sure they'll know. Also, this story should have a trigger warning. 
I (31 f) am still desperately in love with my ex(32 m). We've been broken-up for about 7 1/2 years. It sounds like I'm obsessed, but I promise you, I try so hard to not act on it, and give him the privacy and respect he deserves.  I just need to get this off my chest, and hopefully get some honest responses to my story. Please be a little nice, I was a monster, but I'm human now. Lol


I’m nervous even putting this into words, as I’ve never shared this story before. At sixteen, I left my parents’ home and stepped into a nightmare—an abusive relationship that consumed two years of my life, living with my partner and his family. When it ended, I moved back home, but that didn’t last. I reconnected with someone who became my safe haven—my now-ex—and I never really left his side. For months, I’d cry myself to sleep, haunted by the past, while he held me close, pretending to be asleep to give me space to grieve. He was only eighteen or nineteen, but he made me feel loved and safe in a way I’d never known. To this day, he’s the smartest and kindest person I’ve ever met.
We jumped into our relationship with both feet, even though we agreed it wasn’t meant to be forever. That kept things light for a while. Neither of us pictured settling down, and we were fine with that. He had a promising career, but early on, he lost his job and didn’t want to stay in that field. He bounced between retail jobs, struggling to fit in, and lost a few—maybe four in total within a year or so. It started to strain things between us. We both came from chaotic, upper-middle-class families, too stubborn to ask for help. At one point, we were on the brink of homelessness, but it felt okay because we faced it together. Our bond was so deep, so intertwined, that I sometimes felt we were two halves of the same soul. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel that understood again.
Then life got heavier. At twenty-one, I got pregnant. We were drinking a lot back then, and we decided an abortion was the best choice. He promised we’d try again someday, do it right—get married, plan a family. He found a good job, worked his way up, but I started unraveling. I started having night terrors,  where somebody in a labcoat would cut the baby out of me and run tests on it. My drinking got worse, my anger flared, and we broke up. I went back to my parents’ house, carrying the weight of that loss. I tried dating again, but the first guy I went out with raped me. It was brutal, and the first person I called was my ex. He was furious—not at me, but at the guy, someone we both knew from work. No one believed me; they said he was “too attractive” to do something like that. So I turned back to alcohol, left my parents’ place, and spiraled harder than I thought possible. I was so low, picking fights with anyone, everyone, and especially him. He’d push me away or hide to stop my outbursts, trying everything to help me except calling the police.
Then came another blow: at twenty-two or twenty-three, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. It shattered me. He threw himself into researching ways to help, but I was too lost to listen. I barely took my meds, desperate to feel normal again. My drinking fueled my rage, and my sleep was haunted by night-terrors—about the man who assaulted me, about someone stealing the baby I’d lost. I’d scream without words, until my throat felt like it was bleading and my voice was hoarse for days. I finally disassociated from myself. He kept trying to pull me back, but eventually, he couldn’t anymore.
We went to Mexico for a friend’s bachelorette party, and it was a disaster. I was sick, clingy, and begged him to stay with me instead of going out. He climbed the hotel wall to get away. The next night, I was drugged, and he carried me back to our room as I mumbled his name, fighting to stay conscious. I dont remember anything from that night, but fighting to become coscious and scream for help, but never pulling though. I woke up the next day in a pool of my own vomit, face down on the tile floor, naked, with a goose egg on my forehead. andoned by friends who thought I was just drunk. I could’ve died, i could have drowned myself, and no one would’ve known until morning. I felt betrayed, but I’d made them see me that way.
A few months later, I started to get my shit together.  I told him I didn’t think he loved me anymore, he said I was right. We lived together a bit longer until he found his own place, and then he was gone. We haven’t talked much since. About a year ago, I sent him a message, apologizing for my part in destroying what we had and for blaming him at the time. He was so kind, and appologized for his own part, even offering to meet up for coffee. But, I don’t think it’s fair to reach out again. I feel like he's the one who got away. Since we split, I’ve worked hard on myself—gotten fit, mostly quit drinking, and spent years in therapy. I’ve stumbled a few times, but I’m sober most days. Still, I dream about us together almost every night. It’s been eight years, and we’re strangers now, but I’m stuck. Is this pain something I’ll carry forever, or is there a way to move on, should I reach back out? I’ve tried shifting how I see things, trying to appreciate the growth that happened instead of focusing on my major f-up. but he’s still there, in my heart, in my dreams.",1,1755907046.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1mxmj7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mxmj7f/sf_dream_making/,[SF] Dream Making,"“Oh, spilled some coffee.” It’s been a rush of a morning as Stacey adds some sugar and cream to her coffee. “I’m going to be so late!” She thought to herself as she cleans up the breakroom’s counter.

As she hurries to the lab, she runs through her mental checklist. Dream making is such a difficult job. Everyone has dreams, everyone has a vision of what the world should look like. Dreaming is easy for most people. But turning dreams into reality is a whole different skillset.

“Morning, Stacey,” chirped her colleague, Steve.

“Oh, morning, Steve. I’m so sorry, I’m just in a tearing hurry today,” she replied.

Steve sighed, “I know how you feel. Some days can be like that.” Steve smiled reassuringly, “Same as it has always been.”

Stacey takes a big breath and lets it out. “Alright, let’s do this. Begin pre-firing sequence checks. Chroniton levels?”

Steve types furiously, “Within acceptable range.”

“Tachyon containment?”

“Containment field at 100% strength.”

“Secondary systems?”

“Secondary systems are a go.”

“Primary backup?”

“Primary backup is a go.”

“Is the core room cleared?”

“Core room is cleared of personnel.”

“Precog chamber?”

“Precogs are plugged in and the chamber has been vacated.”

“Precog health check?”

“The doctors report the radiation levels in Precogs are within acceptable limits. The bodies show cancerous tumours consistent with the rate of usage and exposure. We have a few more weeks with the bodies and then we’ll have to transfer out the transcribing AI into fresh empties.”

“Ok, a few weeks is good, normal. AI transcribers?”

“Technicians report AI are ready to transcribe. All teams report ready.”

“So far so good,” Stacey remarked. “Ok, let’s take this slow and steady. Begin firing tachyons, 1,000 parts per million.”

“1,000 parts per million, firing now,” replies Steve. “Containment field is holding steady.”

“Increase to 5,000 parts per million.”

“Increasing to 5,000 parts per million.”

Stacey looks up at the various monitors in the control room. So far, everything is holding steady and there is no sign of a containment breach. “Increase to 10,000 parts per million and hold.”

“Increasing to 10,000 parts per million. Stacey, the containment field wobbled a bit just now.”

“I see it. Try easing up on the pressure gradient by 10%. If it doesn’t work, then reverse and try it at another 10%. It may sound backwards, but sometimes it gets finicky and the opposite action is what’s needed. Hopefully, this should stabilize the containment field.”

“Pressure gradient is at 90% – containment field is stabilized. Holding steady.”

“Ok, that’s good, let’s keep it steady for a minute and then AI can begin transcription.” Stacey set the timer and they waited anxiously. It felt like an eternity, but all of a sudden, the alarm went off and everything was still holding steady.

“We did it,” muttered Steve.

They both looked up at the main monitor in the control room. Stacey fitted her earbuds and leaned back into her seat. They both watched the screen as the AI precogs took the radioactive chronitons and translated the decays into video imaging. There’s still the matter of filtering out high-security images, things that only the Temporal Committee is permitted to see and make decisions on to protect humanity.

“Does she know?” Steve inquired.

“Hmmm? Oh, you mean the new assistant? No, she has no idea what we’re really doing here. All the high security stuff is filtered out.”

“That’s good. What’s her name?”

“Her name’s Helen. All she knows is that she has to transcribe a bunch of videos/images for historical/archival purposes. She has no idea what they really are and where they’re really coming from.”

“Ah, kinda like a conduit.”

“Yea, but a little more than that. I mean, she does have to type down and describe everything she sees into text. That’s about it. Plus, she doesn’t get to see anything that’s truly important. One day, humanity might get to see it all. Or they might not.”

Steve remarks, “It is what it is – knowing everything isn’t always the best for everyone and doesn’t always help everyone either. I mean, not everything comes true even if the Committee aims for it. It’s an imperfect science – more art than anything, really.”

“Very true. It’s immensely tempting to want to know everything and all the details. But sometimes, not knowing is better. And like you say, it’s more like an art. Doesn’t always work the way they want things to work.”

Their conversation ends as they continue to watch the images flashing across the monitor. It’s just another day of dream making.",1,1755906989.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I (20s, M) have a colleague who always laughs at my jokes, and when she does, she will touch my arm and lean towards me - which I’ve not seen her do with any other work colleague. More often than not whenever I am sat near her (we have hot desk policy at work so Im not always sat near her) she will strike up a convo with me. 
Also, the other day we were getting coffee in the canteen together and as I was waiting for the machine to finish making mine I could see her from the corner of my eye standing next to me staring and smiling, a bit like a happy puppy. She sometimes will play w her hair when we talk, and sometimes we do tease each other and can be quite playful. So these all indicate she may like me more than in just a friendly manner. 

But, the reason why I wonder if I am overthinking is bc we don’t have each others socials, or numbers and so never hangout or talk outside of work. I tried testing the waters a bit by messaging her on a couple of occasions at work via teams, just to see if she was receptive to texting, and we talked for a small bit where she’s laughed at messages and stuff, seemingly enjoying the convo but then ends up airing me - so I took that as a no. 
So yeah idk if she’s just being friendly and I’m reading too much into things or maybe she likes the attention idk. 
I know workplace situations are always a sticky one, so there could be some caution bc of that maybe? 

TL;DR: I think my colleague may like me but I think I am getting mixed signals and that I’m actually overthinking it. ",1,1755906960.0,bodylanguage,0,1.0,False

When she was a child my life was different and complicated... My parents unfortunately were religious fanatics, I separate myself very seriously from the word of God, always saying things, playing everyone, since she is a child, I didn't know what was happening little by little when I grew up, I realized how wrong it was, but until they loved me they gave me affection, they never asked themselves what I was doing in secret, they always left me ""free""... But there was one thing I couldn't do, it was the only rule of the house...

I never opened the basement door...

I was always a good child, always obeying them, so of course I never opened the door but I always had a child's curiosity, always wondering what was behind the door and I remember one night where my curiosity only increased...

It was in the middle of the night, I was sleeping alone but you were woken up by a strange noise, not in the kitchen, in the bathroom, but in the basement... I was scared but at the same time curious... 

Fear VS curiosity... Curiosity won...

Calmly opening the door, still scared... Everything was dark but there was still the moonlight to illuminate it, I went down the stairs... And I went to the darkest part of the house, right in the corner and there was the cellar door... It was locked, there were even padlocks and chains to fasten it... I got close and heard a noise like someone crying... I was about to touch the doorknob but I was scared! 

:AHHHHH!

father: calm daughter... Is daddy, is everything ok? 

:ah...y-yes...

I was surprised that my father woke up at that time, scared I asked...

: Dad, what are you doing up at this time, shouldn’t you be sleeping?...

He was silent for a while but he only replied that he had gotten up to drink water, I just agreed and asked him to take me to bed and I slept... But the sound of crying that was in the basement was still in my head I had so many questions...

Who was crying? 

Who's inside? 

What are my parents hiding from me? 

I was so tired that just sleeping the next day everything was fine my father was acting as if nothing had happened that night I just had coffee and sat without saying anything just thinking about crying... So I decided to do something... Something that I regret but it was so worth it...

I asked my mother to give me some money, lying and saying that I was going to buy some things abroad. 

Mom: Of course, honey, here's the money 

She gave me the money and I left but I was watching through the window and I saw my mother going blind very quickly, she took the key to the cellar, now I knew where the key was hidden, she opened the door to the cellar and took bread and water and her stairs and I didn't see her... When she came back she was looking angry and I saw something that to this day... It haunts me... Their hands were covered in blood, looking like they had beaten someone... I just turned around... and ran to the market, I looked at the money and I realized that I had enough to be able to buy some things after all she gave me a lot of money, 

I bought some simple things food drinks vegetables and other things but I also bought rat poison in case it was necessary...

I came home and pretended a happy smile, my parents welcomed me with a hug and a smile that looked more like a smile... Happy but at the same time forced, I discreetly looked at my mother's hands and they were clean as if nothing had happened,",0,1755906923.0,strange,2,0.33,False

Written for the Savannah Mirage Blog on Patreon by TLA Kavolwa.

A still breeze came from the west, everyone raised their faces from their phones and looked around. We were in a circle around the flame which had burned continuously for the last seven days. Every other night this characteristic breeze came. Visitors from the city who came to help us with our predicament had long gone, like three days ago. Everyone here knew exactly why they remained so whatever business they got engaged in, they never forgot to watch out for the signs.

No one briefs those remaining for this purpose, no one even organizes it. It is out of sheer volition. During this period most tough customs are relaxed, it’s like a holiday in honor of the deceased. In-laws can shake hands, eat together and even get drunk from the same pot.

Everyone is super vigilant, scanning their neighbors’ face and throwing a random short question but with deep vocabulary like, “This squall is an aberration,” then looking straight into their eye for a reply. The assumption is that everyone present comes from around or can be identified by someone from around. If one fails the test, it is still okay but is then compelled to explain how this happens. So after every breeze, there follows a sudden surge in noise across the compound which soon subsides in the third minute as everyone successfully explains themselves.

You will occasionally hear one prolonged conversation, and if you are keen you’ll notice everyone deeply interested in it. Those who know anyone in the conversation will come for flimsy reasons. “What is the time my child?” or “How comes you aren’t feeling cold?” or simply “Thank heavens I have found you!”

It is a silent code that none of these questions matter so no one struggles to answer them perfectly, all is required is to tie an invitation to the conversation into the answer. Something like, “No I’m not cold, I’m lost in a conversation with my friend here.” Then the other goes, “Ha-ha, over what now? We are mourning for God’s sake!” and then joins the conversation steering it towards identity with a “Wait, where does your friend come from?”

Now depending on where the conversation has reached, the intruder will either answer themselves or the common friend might help. If the answer makes perfect sense the interest subsides and they are left alone. If not, more scrutiny questions keep popping up. The weirder it gets, the more people keep joining.

They will run you through a series of questions and wherever you claim to come from, someone from there or near there is likely here. It is therefore common to see visitors haunting visitors with questions like, “You say you come from Bellyrood? Where exactly because I’m also from Bellyrood.” The haunting takes a professional turn until the intruder demonstrates real native knowledge of Bellyrood. If not, it takes a confrontational turn. It escalates to serious levels and to the real question, “What brings you here?”

This is the final question, there usually are no more questions going forward. Any more question is taxed. This is how they identify a corpse thief.

Here corpses are stolen. Especially if the deceased died a sudden death that did not incapacitate their physique. A perfectly normal person who died in a road accident won’t be stolen. The same goes for a person who has ailed for a long time. But those succumbing to poisoning, murder, heart attacks and other similar causes are a great target.

My friend’s cousin had died of electrocution. We came here two weeks ago and by now I’m fairly known. My identity is uncontested. I still keep close to him because that’s simply how it works here. But he doesn’t smoke so occasionally I have to excuse myself for this compulsive need. The homestead is big but smoke is best under a tree so I hang around the periphery of the home or into the bananas and sometimes further into the farm. Crops have been trodden down so I’m not damaging any, they were long damaged by the night discos that were here for three nights leading up to the burial day.

I’m also not alone here, neither am I creative or super inventive. It is just a thing we smokers do here. My packet is in my trench coat’s inside pocket right about my chest. It has pockets on both sides so I do a double tap; the left hand pats the right side and the right hand pats the left. It is in the left. I squeeze my trouser pockets simultaneously and then one hand in my back pocket to check for my lighter, I find it in my back pocket.

That weird breeze or gust comes again so I can’t light my cigarette. I know the gust, so I hastily but maturely begin making towards the fire. This gust is unique, it is actually a breeze but it can shake trees and drop leaves. It can raise dust off the ground and other mighty works which a breeze should not achieve.

I arrive to that surge of murmuring that accompanies it and I’m now on the receiving end. “The squall is an aberration.” An old man with yellow teeth, clearly a smoker, tells me. I smile like we all do when a weird situation is still green. I scan the fire for my friend and oops! he is not there. “Pardon me, I’m not from around,” I reply to the old man knowing well the green situation is about to get yellow.

“Where are you from?” he asks, staring at my brown trench coat which has caught some blackjack seeds and then at my godfather which makes me stand out.

“I’m with Sedgy.”

“Sedgy?” he replies, wondering how that answers the simple question he asked.

“And where does Sedgy come from?”

His look has gotten philosophical, a steady inquisitive focus with a borrowed patience.

I quickly realize Sedgy is not known here. I am in the wrong flame. I wish I had gone procedural and said where I come from, so now I try my luck. “I come from Bellyrood. South Bellyrood.” I look at them with eyes of hope because Bellyrood is not that far from here.

“Do you know Oakman?” one of the faces replies.

“Yes I do. I come two kilometers south of that. It is actually my nearest shopping center.” I look at him but then realize he is not content with my answer.

“Which Oakman are you talking about?” he asks.

“Oakman shopping center with Greenspan Supermarket,” I reply.

“Greenspan?”

It is clear that I’m not making any progress when another guy raises his stooping head to reveal his face illuminated by the orange light from the flame. “There are many Oakman, which one do you mean?” He doesn’t look me in the eye, a sure sign of rage.

“Bellyrood County Oakman,” I clarify.

“Yes!” he raises his voice, “I’m from Bellyrood and we have three Oakmans there. Which Oakman?”

Now that is an absolutely new fact to me. I am twice puzzled and my face gives it away.

“Talk!” goes another man. He was reclined on his chair with his head facing the sky. This conversation must have taken a third turn for him to sit upright and stare into my eyes.

Time to throw out my big card. “I’m Pastor Delib’s son.” My dad is popular, his church towers that sleepy shopping center. It is the biggest in Oakman.

“Pastor’s son!?” around three guys exclaim simultaneously. Two are seated on each of my side, to my left a skinny man with no heavy cloth on but with a cap and to my right that old man who was questioning me. Another exclaimer was totally new to me, he had not spoken until now.

“But you smoke?” the new guy asks sarcastically.

I’m embarrassed and have also embarrassed the church and dad and mom and congregants. And then goes another man, “You are too big to bring in your dad. Can’t you just explain yourself like a man?”

They all laugh somehow easing the tension which gives me a chance to try again. “Well,” I begin, “I am Bellyrood from Oakman, my clan is Denz and our house of Minty.” Their faces glow especially of the two guys seated on each of my side.

“See? We are brothers,” the cap guy joyfully remarks.

“Immediately I saw your face, it felt familiar. I can spot a Denz a mile away. So, what brings you here?” he asks.

“Ah, I have a friend here, the deceased is his cousin.” This is exactly how you explain relationships with the dead. You don’t say cousin to the deceased. Nope. Wrong. The deceased comes first. He takes the center stage. So a dad for example will say, the deceased is my son. Not I’m father to the deceased. I pass this subtle booby trap with much accolades from them. “He’s a nice young man, he knows how to speak.”

The situation here is controlled now but the wind comes once more and a few more times. I’m still chilled by the encounter and remain silent, sleep creeps in. I’m woken up by someone kicking my leather boots.

“Yoh bro, bro,” he calls on me, kicking at my foot. I wake to a cup of tea right on my face. It is five and everyone is preparing for the day. This is the time to clean up. The bathrooms are makeshift, some have sheets for doors, some have sacks as both doors and walls. Others are planted round like a tiny maze. They don’t have anything else. Waking up early is part of the design consideration. There is enough light to see without a torch but not enough to see clear figures through the bush or should a breeze blow the door open.

All the seats around me are empty, I’m the only one in the whole compound still seated so I stand to make even. My eyes catch a glimpse of a loosely gathered crowd at the other end of the homestead. They seem concerned and deliberating.

“What is down there?” I ask my friend, pointing to the crowd with my cup of tea.

“Oh, yeah,” he begins, holding his cup with both hands, “something has happened.”

I know what he means.

“Tragic,” I reply, trying to look the most remorseful I can.

He understands my suppressed curiosity really well so he begins walking in that direction. “The guy is gone.” He repeats again with his head stooped, his eyes looking at his footsteps, “the guy is gone.”

He is disappointed more than I have ever seen him before so I’m lost at what I can do. I reserve my comments and actually the silence feels therapeutic. We walk to the spot listening to our heavy clothes making weird brushing sounds.

The grave is sunk and a few visible cracks run but one dominates. His cousin was a social person and when a man who knows how to live with other people dies, bulls are brought to fight at the grave. The result is that the ground is more compact and flatter than what you’d typically find. It is one sure way to tell whether a grave belongs to a man or a woman.

“These incidences are increasing of late,” remarks a random old man, wise enough to understand this kind of thing. Everyone’s mood is low and contemplative. Women are sobbing and cursing round the grave.

If you knew what happens with the corpses, this instance becomes more painful than even death itself. The stolen corpses are walked during the night, when day comes they are hidden somewhere safe like overgrown river banks or young sugarcane plantations until night falls again. They walk about 40 kilometers and into the neighboring country where they proceed for another sixty before reaching the land of the Gasok people where they are sorted to various grades before being put to specific use.

The possessed bodies of women do weeding while the men do first digging. The work they do is diverse but most importantly the possessed bodies are whooped and threatened. It is slavery of the dead. It is said that you can hear whips lashing through still night until shortly before dawn. That you can hear sounds of metal clanking which is hoes being hit against each other to remove wet clay and grass that sticks on them every then while digging.

The Gasok people are serious farmers, they produce much of the food their side of their country eats. They plant bananas where it is said that the corpses dig ditches for planting because they do deeper ditches. The deeper the ditch the longer the banana will be able to last, tolerate winds and yield big without breaking.

They also produce cereals, like sesame and millet, it is said these are a preserve for female corpses since they are more watchful. They do the sowing, weeding, threshing and winnowing. They also produce cassava which is harvested by uprooting. This is a preserve for male corpses. They harvest and bring the bulky produce to the farmer’s house where female corpses peel and leave them to ferment before eventually drying them.

After a while the corpses wear. Their arms are dismembered, and cured stiff. They are used as a stirring stick while fermenting millet flour for making rum.

The sun is rising and our work here futile, everyone finds it hard to bear the shame so they start leaving. I think hard for an excuse and remind my friend about the story I was supposed to write for my Patreon. He nods in approval so I walk to my car. It is a low-key recession. The city people are gathering around their now idling private school bus which had not coughed for the past eight days.

A man from the gathering crowd spots me and gives me the hitchhiker’s eye. I know it before they even ask, but I ignore them and reverse out my car which I had parked nose-in along the hedge of a recently cleared bush. I’m going straight to the city, I’m afraid of going to Oakman, I may meet with someone who saw me smoking.

The gentleman helps me back up giving me hand signals and scattered verbal advice against tree stumps. “Do a full turn, yeah exactly, now back up slowly.” I make use of my side mirror but he discards my caution. “No, everything back here is fine, just back up.”

I’m left trusting a stranger who now has a lady carrying a suitcase by his side. The lady is silent and I dare guess hopeful.

“Thank you,” I say looking at him with a weak wave and a smile.

“Welcome,” he replies.

I’m about to rave on but as soon as the wheels start rolling he goes. “Where are you headed friend?” looking at me with a contagious pure heart. Honesty possesses me and I reply, “City. I am headed to the city.” Actually by now I have considered how lonely travelling alone is going to be and was open for suggestions.

“Can we tag along? I can chip in on fuel.”

“Yeah, sure,” I reply.

He thanks me for the kind gesture, explains how his wife vomits in the bus, then signals the suitcase lady. We are off.

I pass Oakman at a good speed and I hear them murmur, “This place has not developed.” I look through the rearview mirror and catch the woman’s eye. She looks away and points to the very road that goes home, “Look, it’s still a dirt road.”

It is apparent that they are from around so I ask boldly, “You guys know this place?”

“Yes we do.” The lady jumps on before the man, “We are from this place. We are Denzs from the house of Minty but we have been in the city for a really long time.” The man arrives two seconds late into the conversation.

“That’s great,” I reply, looking into the rearview mirror hoping to catch someone’s eye.

“We are brothers,” I exclaim. The lady is visibly happy but not the man. I know why. You see the lady is too comfortable, she hasn’t realized how incriminating that one statement is. You can’t marry from your clan or house. It is possible with bigger clans but not Denz. I quickly assess the situation and devise a plan to salvage it.

These two were married against the customs and may never return there because they are in effect outcasts. This topic is sensitive and the lady seems to have now realized what she just did. Her face goes dim in an instant, she pulls tighter on her shawl and rests back into the seat. The man remains upright and exudes some willingness to proceed with the conversation in some way.

“The funeral,” I say, “what do you think?”

“That’s definitely something,” he replies.

I notice with my peripheral view, his eyes searching for eye contact in the rearview mirror but I keep my eyes on the road. This signals a certain form of disinterest in the topic so he proceeds.

“I think it’s all about how we bury.”

“How we bury?” I ask. “How do we bury?”

“Why did you go there?” he asks me. I look for his eyes in the rearview mirror so he can assess my honesty. “I had gone to help a friend mourn; the deceased is his cousin.”

My answer is satisfactory because he is my brother anyway. So he delves deeper.

“You see friend, we used to bury with good real wood coffins. They were rigid and take longer to soak. They also could bear serious weight, that’s one.”

He is eager to see how receptive I am so I approve of that assessment.

He proceeds. “Second, my friend, we are used to fill the grave with soil. Nowadays we put a little slab and cover it while still wet. Those two are my reasons.” He winds up his case but by now his wife is sound asleep.

“Excuse her,” he says with a grin of shame.

“No worries,” I reply.

“Why then did you stay this long?” I ask.

“Well, he is my boss’s brother, so it is so near to my heart.”

I understand the dynamics and shut up, I see a filling station ahead and stop by. Right ahead is a grocery market so he requests me to allow them to buy things here, they cost cheaper than the city. I go into a café for some coffee and they go for groceries.

So I watch movies and anime hell I even read books sometimes even though reading isn't one of my favorite things.. but I guess the reason I do it is because since I don't know if I'm ever going to have that perfect someone in my life I can at least watch someone else have that moment and feel happy for them.. and I'm even the type of guy who would hold your purse while you drag me around Sephora just so you can have a good time and I'll even let you put makeup on me fuck I'm not ashamed of it we can wear matching PJs while watching ""how to train your dragon"" or something. And I would even bake with her you know I love baking it just makes me feel happy... Being with someone I KNOW isn't going to leave me behind... And truly wants to be there with me for the rest of our lives...

I've become extremely unenergetic lately, and it's harming my life because I have a shit ton of responsibilities I need to deal with.

I've tried one sip of iced and hot latte, and one sip of black coffee before, but didn't like either of them. Keep in mind, I only had one sip, so I never really experienced what it's like to be on like 150mg+ of caffeine.

Should I just keep going without any caffeine at all? Or should I start drinking some? And if so, what drinks should I try? I'd prefer some healthy options if possible.

Also, because Da Xiong is a reference to Nobito from Doramon, who does whatever he can for his friends. From what was shown, he's a ridiculously confident, kind, and outgoing person.

  


**A Friend.**



**<Glimmer Labs>** 



The warehouse doors rose without any trouble. Nothing happened to the building but everything changed for her. She walked past the crates collecting dust and the shelves that held the weight of countless failures. Da Xiong never called them failures. 



“I forget the words.” Lou Li thought out loud. Stopping and looking to her side hoping her boisterous friend would remind her. But he wasn’t there.



She continued on till she reached her work space. Their work space. Nuonuo, in a coma. Da Xiong, beaten to death. Dad stabbed through the heart. The display came alive for her. The blue light highlighted her eye bags. Though mom had dragged her back home for rest Lou Li had snuck out and returned. Time and time again.



The video she was able to scavenge from the remains played where she left it. Da Xiong’s legs were trapped under rubble. His last words:



“Nuonuo? Nuonou! Quickly run!”



Then with a tripod the fedora suited man struck Da Xiong’s head. One. His glasses were knocked off, shattered and stained with his blood. Two. Three. Four. Five. His finger twitched. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. His body still twitched. Ten. She couldn’t count any more. For all her genius Lou Li couldn’t count past ten. 



At the funeral, they couldn’t even reform his head. The examiner said that Da Xiong felt almost all the strikes. His muscles tensed in on themselves, lactic acid was present.



The video proceeded. Her father shielded Nuonou. Stabbed through the heart. Arms beaten by countless weapons. He didn’t falter but Nuonou couldn’t be shielded from it all. 



“He died of blood loss, slow and painful.”



“She can recover but there will be scars. Don’t expect her to be the same after she wakes. Her scans show that she received an enormous amount of shock. The top therapists will be on stand when she awakens.”



Then there was the scientist around them. Work colleagues she just met, killed all the same. Blunt weapons and fists. Meeting their families at their funerals was impossible but she was there. Silent and alone. 



Lou Li closed her eyes but the scene didn’t disappear from her mind. The video couldn’t capture the details she saw. Her father’s grim expression. Nounou’s lifeless despair. She couldn’t even find Da Xiong in her field of view. She couldn’t recognize him. 



“E-soul, Clone Shit, Nice!”



She gnashed down those names drawing blood from her lips. At the hospital she met Nuonou’s mother. They talked. A little bit. Nothing much.



“She was doing better lately.”



“Ah yes.” Lou Li answered listlessly. Her gaze never left Nuonuo. Not because that’s all Lou Li wanted to see but because she couldn’t face her mother.



“When your father recruited her, my little Nuonuo celebrated for a week. She drank a lot. Lately, she’s been coming home a little tipsy at times. Thank you.”



“I-I’m sorry.”



That was all Lou Li could say. She ran away. Remembering the kiss on her cheek and the conversations they had affirming each other. You can be a hero. Become a hero. That was all the trust Lou Li needed.



“But it wasn’t all the trust I wanted.” Lou Li muttered in the present. “I wanted Dad’s trust, Mom’s trust. Da Xiong you too. I wanted you all to trust me! Because if you trusted me I could’ve been there! I could’ve saved you all!”



She smashed her hands against her desk. Her arms are weak … cute, they stung useless. Tears streamed down her face. Her bones creaked and the number on her arm flashed down by one. 



4



She knew she couldn’t have saved them. She could barely hold her own against Nice. What about the clones? What about E-soul? She wasn’t strong enough. Even with her suit, she wasn’t strong enough outside of the bounds of trust.



“Nuonuo, I want to kill them. I want to bash their heads in. I want to make them suffer! That’s my dream now! That’s all I want!”



Lou Li sat down on the floor by Nuonuo’s desk. The connection they had, the validation they gave each other. Of course, Nuonuo couldn’t answer now. It was impossible.



“I can do it right? You’re telling me I can do it.”



She curled up and let her hate flow. That’s all she could do at the moment. Cry and plot. Cry and hope. Cry and dream because her body was weighing her down. She couldn’t walk in a straight line and her breaths were uneven. Most days she had emotions robbed of her, numb. Today was not most days and she was so tired of it.



“There’s no point in crying. I have to find something here that can help me rebuild. Help me get strong and take down the abusers of this arbitrary trust system.”



So Lou Li returned to her numb self and scoured the warehouse for failures. For weapons. All were useless. Bombs of unstable design. Guns that jammed. Most of the things in Glimmer labs weren’t used for hero work. Hero design. Days passed and beyond coffee and stale bread she had eaten nothing. Sleeping perhaps a few hours a night.



“There’s nothing here and I can’t think of anything!” 



Lou Li tried to yell but her voice was raspy. Nuonuo. Nuonuo. Dad. She repeated their names hoping for some help. Inspiration but nothing came. Nothing in the dusty depot could improve her odds against Nice. Everyday his trust climbed. She saw the number rising again and again. Oh he fought Wreck last week. Oh he rescued people from a failing helicopter. He was getting stronger and stronger while Lou Li remained stagnant. Her suit wasn’t improving as much as she needed it to. Its frame was too small to pack the machinery she could imagine.



“I need to get stronger.”



Lou Li collapsed walking back to her desk. A shadow shaded her from the harsh warehouse lights that pegged her night and day. 



“Thank you. This place finally provides me something…”



She knew what the tarp was. She knew what was underneath it. Disappointment. But it was also something Da Xiong had left behind. Something she didn’t want to touch as it preserved her memory of him.



“You two can help me build it!”



“No way!’ Lou Li chuckled, remembering her first day at Glimmer Labs. Da Xiong was her guide then.



She glanced at his desk. Stacks and stacks of papers she made sure were left untouched. If a sheet fell she placed it back on his desk. He was always a bit unorganized but she memorized where everything was. Nuonuo was much cleaner. Easier to keep track of.



“No way.” Lou Li muttered, drawing strength from the shadow she made her way to Da Xiong’s desk. 



A display prompt opened. Password? There were plenty of guesses but Da Xiong was quite eccentric perhaps it was mech related, an anime maybe. A roadblock but to be fair Nuonuo also didn’t share her password. Lou Li didn’t either. It just didn’t make sense. As she stared at the screen an arm's width away the message changed.



‘Access Granted’



Lou Li shook her head and rubbed her eyes. What? He didn’t have a password? No he would always have one. This only means…



It was obvious for anyone to understand. Suddenly, Da Xiong appeared beside her. A confident smile and a corny thumbs up. Annoying in normal circumstances but in this case, her eyes received nourishment. 



“I will always trust you.”



It was a figment of her imagination but it was also true. If she asked him that’s the response she’d get. She cried smiling. A weak smile, the first one she could ever manage after that... Feeling better than she had in days but also worse. It was quite sometime before she intruded on his privacy, an hour perhaps but he trusted her to do so.



“So you’ve continued working on your mech. As Nuonuo said, you're trying to improve your MCU and IMU. The processor and calculator. Wait she said this doesn’t meet the standard but it’s so stacked. The improvements aren’t small but even before they’re beyond any current model and this is because…”



The notes at the side completed her sentence.



“I got bullied by my junior today. The test didn’t meet the standards because my mech is too heavy. But! But! It’s also very strong! 100 tons! It can lift it no problem! It’s just that the power draw is too high, puts strain on the MCUs and honestly the weapons system sucks. It jams too often but the net rounds work better than anything in the market, it’s just too expensive. Glimmer labs won’t give me the funds for the improvements I want. Also it isn’t my job to make this. It’s more of a little project on the side. I have deadlines. I have excuses! For its capabilities- ”



“It takes more to perform to the standard level and pass standard tests.” 



Lou Li walked over to the mech and climbed onto the platform. She pulled away the tarp revealing a design most people wouldn’t like. She certainly didn’t like it. An antique and outdated taste perhaps. It certainly wasn’t anything a hero would… suit up. It didn’t look like a hero’s mech. It was 



“Perfect. I can see it now. Da Xiong it’s a masterpiece.”



Honest thoughts, no feelings spared and she was going to take it apart. Its parts were perfect for her. She could fill the gaps that Da Xiong had left behind. She was a bit more calm now. Driven by rage but quelled by his memory. 



“This joint puts too much stress on the conductors.”



“Da Xiong, I can just redesign it. My suit initially had some of the same issues. A dense socket.”



“I think the cockpit is uncomfortable. Of all the things I get stuck on it’s designing a comfortable chair!”



“My suit is comfortable. Ah, maybe I can design it to fit inside. I can fight with both your mech and my suit. I’ll also add more weapons. You’re not good at designing weapons. But the sturdiness, the strength, it’s all here. There’s also space, plenty of space for my weapons.”



She slept a bit better now. Her mother came by to give her food which Lou Li devoured with ernest. Glimmer Labs let her move along, given her wealth and her dads wishes there were no issues there. She visited Nuonuo. That was a painful part of her day but she’d tell her about the progress of the mech and as always ask for affirmation. Touched and squeezed her hand with comfort. She’d visit her dad’s grave with flowers and she’d place some beside Da Xiong’s as well but she’d sometimes skip this because.



“They showed up again today.”



Lou Li was redesigning the hand back in the warehouse. It was perfect but she wanted her style to fit. It was an instinctive choice. One that Da Xiong had endorsed. She conversed with him through his notes. They were written on paper initially and he scanned it into the database once he was finished.



Da Xiong was silent and of course there was no answer for this. He was dead. How was he going to mediate between his parents and his childhood friend?



“Uncle and aunty were so broken at the funeral. I couldn’t approach them. Even when they came to dad’s funeral they looked worse than me. Your mother also looks like you. How can I face them? How can I even be a hero after all this?”



No response.



“Are you going to be silent too? Dad didn’t say anything. Nuonuo saw what heroes do. Would she really want me to work alongside Nice? E-soul? How can I work among them? How can I be a hero when they represent what it means? Da Xiong you’re normally so bullheaded and talkative so tell me, please. Can I still be a hero?” 



She looked at another line.



“It’ll be hard to pilot without an assistant. I can’t hire a man in my ear. I’m thinking it should be artificial intelligence. That’s right! I just need to somehow learn how to design one and…”



Lou Li dropped the page. There were no answers from him either. Her mother wouldn’t say much. No it’s because Lou Li couldn’t hear her. Be safe. Don’t go down this path. If you get hurt too… She picked up the page and returned it to his desk, 27 counts underneath the fourth stack.



At that moment the warehouse door creaked open and a woman with glasses and afro hair walked in. Her steps echoed throughout the warehouse. Her presence froze Lou Li in place. Da Xiong’s mother walked up to her and she hugged her.



“None of this is your fault. Please rest Xiao Li.”



Lou Li’s body gave in. It seems the only thing she could do was cry.



“I’m sorry, aunty. I’m sorry I couldn’t save any of them even though they trusted me. Even though they trusted me!”



**<Da Xiong’s House>**



It was a two story house in the rich suburbs but it was average and modest. The backyard was barely a quarter of the size of the driveway and there was no basement or attic. Two bathrooms. Two bedrooms. Lou Li walked through the door guided by Da Xiong’s mom.



“This is your second home.” Aunty coaxed.



“Is uncle?”



“He’s visiting his parents. They need his comfort as well.”



“Then why-”  
  


“Yes I would’ve visited with him but I remembered you watching from afar. Your black car stands out. You stalk their graves. I don’t know what to say to help you but your mother asked me to help. She says you talk to Da Xiong all the time.”



“I’m sorry but nothing she says will stop me. I need to bring them to justice. Da Xiong was murdered by-”  
  


“Heroes. I already know. There’s nothing I can say to stop you but don’t neglect yourself.” Aunty leaned forward to wipe a tear forming in Lou Li’s eye. “If you have anything you need to say you can speak with me. I won’t tell your mother if you wish but Da Xiong would want, well this-”



His mother handed Luo Li a journal. It was old and weathered. Perhaps almost as old as her and inside was Da Xiong’s handwriting. Messy but easily readable for her now. It was thick and unfinished.



“You were his most important friend. He’d listen to everything you wish to tell him. So listen to him.”



“Have you read this?”



“No but I know my son and I think it’s time you remember him as well. So please sit. I’ll make some apple cider, your favorite.”



She disappeared into the kitchen. Luo Li sat on the living room unchanging sofa, journal in hand. Should she be allowed to read his deepest secrets? This was weird. This was strange. What if there were things she didn’t want to know about him? As she hesitated Lou Li remembered his password. He didn’t need one for her.



“Ok then answer my questions. She flipped through pages until she stumbled upon one page. A day written so many years ago. The writing was childish.”



Dear Me,



Today Lou Li saved me with a kowtowing arrow. It was really cool. The design of her hero costume was really cute too. She asked me what I thought. So I said what I thought. Then she ran away when I was reaching for an umbrella. I always have everything ready in my backpack-



‘Of course you do.’ Lou Li smirked instinctively.



I prepared a second one for her because I knew she would forget it. It’s the blue lightning one that she said looks cool. She disappeared when I turned around. I guess she was going to beat the rain herself. Inspirational!



‘What in the world?’ Lou Li thought. She remembered that day. She thought he was confessing to her. It was also the day she decided to be a little distant from him. Truth be told they played together the next day. The next few years. Every year after that technically.



She read further and noticed he made a note that was indecipherable but it seemed to mark this day as an important day. It was an important day for her as well. 



“I could’ve shared more things.” Lou Li grumbled but read through. Most of the entries were trivial. Daily life was fun and detailed: the time he spent with her, school, other friends, he was quite popular, family, and generally he was always a cheerful, bubbly guy. Just as she remembered him. The note scribbles he made appeared a few times. They appeared on the day of his graduation. His acceptance into Glimmer Labs. It appeared on many entries of birthdays. His, Lou Li’s, one for Nuonuo, his parents, his extended family, and other friends. It appeared quite a few times actually. Not few in number.



“So that’s an important day for you too. You should’ve celebrated with me.” She grumbled but then she remembered her father had taken him away on that day. Preparations for the trip for sure.



Still Da Xiong had marked the top left corner of the page on the day he gave her a tour of Glimmer Labs. 



Dear Me,



I should really stop addressing myself. It seems, well, weird. No it doesn’t matter because today Lou Li is finally joining Glimmer Labs! She got here just as fast as I did but she did design that suit. Looking at her blue prints, I know it must work perfectly! It was so impressive I had to ask her to help me with the mech but of course she turned me down. My brilliant proposal and my design were disgusting in her eyes. She tried to lie to me too but ha I told her to be truthful because she’s at her best when telling the truth. As if my feelings are something to be spared I know my mech is brilliant!



But honestly finding out how she pursued her dream for heroism left me… utterly pumped! If I had any other reaction I might as well quit my position at Glimmer Labs! She’s been hiding it from her family and me. Well I do have a loud mouth. I might have told them. That makes sense but I wish she told me. I know she was doing something. She always finds a way to be herself and follow her dreams. It’s impossible that she wasn’t but maybe I could’ve helped. The warehouse has a lot of materials that can be discarded. If she asked, I could've helped her. Then I could’ve also asked her for help but that’s besides the point.



Honestly, I feel reinvigorated. There’s a noticeable gap between uncle and I. Nuonuo is also smarter than me and she would never help me. I also have a lot of work to do even if I’m learning so much. So when my mech failed, I didn’t touch upon it as much. I guess I couldn’t trust myself as much as I could trust the people around me. But seeing Lou Li doing what I know she would always be doing reminded me of the day she saved me from bullies. Thinking back they didn’t do much beyond teasing and a bit of pushing. Kids are kids but she was so cool. I think she made weight changing plunger arrows if I remember correctly. The kowtowing arrow. I didn’t speak correctly, I guess. My memory isn’t perfect. I should just flip to the page! 



Ah! I called her cute. She hates when people call her that! Well I will not sugarcoat this but it is the objective truth. Just as it’s the objective truth that she’s a bit dull and quick to jump to conclusions! Very impatient too, haha. But that doesn’t matter. Heroes shouldn’t look cute is a stupid idea. How can a hero be defined by just mere looks? Regardless of how she looks Lou Li has always been a hero.



I wrote one thing right. She is inspirational. Thus I must continue my mech project even if I don’t get enough sleep. I will make a mech that’s really cool too. I will succeed just like Luo Li will. She’ll look at it with disgust again but this time it’ll work perfectly! I know it! I just have to finish work first. Alien stuff. It’s fascinating. Planning. Managing. Ordering. At least I don’t have to attend the higher meetings. I think. Maybe I should ask for overtime pay. Overtime pays in the form of materials. Yes I’ll pitch that idea to uncle. It’ll be perfect!



“You’re always so blunt but it would’ve been better if you said everything on your mind.” Lou Li felt the corners of her mouth tug. “Of course, I’m not one to talk, Da Xiong.”



He wrote much like he talked boastful and confident in tone. Surprisingly there were no secrets she skimmed through that changed anything she knew. She remembered it all. He was an irreplaceable childhood friend. If she asked that question again his response would be:



“You will become the hero you want to be Luo Li. Don’t ever doubt yourself! I know you can do it.”



He appeared before her in her mind again. Smiling stupidly. Giving her a thumbs up. It was so cheerful that she wanted to turn away. It was embarrassing how he expressed himself so confidently. Nuonuo turned away whenever he was too enthusiastic. Dad too. The other researchers as well. But for a brief moment she forgot her pain by remembering her friend. She couldn’t turn away from this image.



“I wish you were here with me. We could talk. You’d ask me to help you build your mech and this time I wouldn’t turn it down.”



Lou Li glanced at her trust value. It shot up by one digit. 



5.



She had to live up to his expectations. His trust. He’d support her all the way. Just like Nuonuo. And her father was perhaps the same. He just wanted to protect her no matter how strong she got. That made them a bit distant. What they needed was the time that had been robbed from them.



“Your apple cider, Xiao Li.” Aunty returned.  
  


“You know I’m better now?” Addressing the length of time she left her alone.



“You’re smiling.”



“But I will bring them to justice. I will never forget.”



“But you’ll live beyond it. Nuonuo will get better. You can become who you want to be.”



Luo Li’s smile disappeared. Her mindset had changed but her future not so much. Her hatred burned just as strongly. She could still only count to ten before going blind. The urge to crush and destroy those clones still gripped her when she remembered her father’s wound. Nuonuo’s hospital bed would still stab at her heart like a wooden stake. Her desire would never stop consuming her, but it was slowed at the moment. She had to prepare for when she could meet those heroes again. 



**<Two Years Later, Glimmer Labs>**



“Da Xiong.”



The mech roared to life. Its pink and white paint matched the design of her suit. Just a few more tests and it will be ready for the tournament. It’ll be ready for justice.



“Lou Li. How can I help you today?” Da Xiong the mech asked. The voice was almost the same but more robotic. She needed some distinction between the ai and her memories of him. Still the mech, though drastically improved, carried the pieces of his dream. She could never thank him enough, even with the sleep she traded it.



“We’ll be testing grit. The hero's trait. We’ll be up for it. Proto-Shock has appeared near that Bank again. We’ll fight him and after that…”



Lou Li glanced at the flowers she had bought in the morning. They rested on her desk.



“I’ll visit them again.”

Why wasn’t I told sooner? Maybe the universe wants me to keep struggling with my 9-5, but NO—I’ve uncovered something WILD, and major side hustle FOMO is setting in. Seriously, these apps actually pay you to... TEST NEW FEATURES?! I thought those surveys that split you $1 weren't real, until 2025 happened and these LEGIT, real-paying, shockingly fun platforms started popping up all over. What is HAPPENING 🤯

Okay, hold my digital coffee. Let’s get into the **top 7 legit apps that pay actual money just to test features**—and, honestly, some pay in ways I didn't even think were possible.

- **GoodNovel TestApp**: First in line because, WHAT?! You get paid to read stories before anyone else? This is next-level beta-reader vibes. Check it here 👉 **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (Seriously, you NEED to experience it).

- **BetaBucks**: Is it me, or is this the only app that’s slick about *gamifying* testing? Test new games or social features, earn real cash. It's suspiciously fun. **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (second time, because I love it THAT much).

- **SneakPeek Squad**: Why are people not talking about this? If you like being THAT friend who knows what new filters twist your selfies, this is basically them handing you money for it!

- **Appinions**: I'm SHOCKED at how easy it is. You give your straight-up feedback, they PayPal you faster than some friends split dinner.

- **FutureFirst**: Imagine: Uber, but for being the guinea pig. You get “rides” (ok, feature tests), and each one actually pays out.

- **Trendify Panels**: These guys are desperate for *real* opinions. Tried and tested—payments clear every Friday like clockwork.

- **UX Wealthmine**: Are designers spying on what stuff annoys you? They pay to know about every confusing tab and annoying popup. It feels cathartic.

But back to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** —I ran it twice, then made my MOM sign up. No lie, she bought groceries with that week’s earnings.

Are these get-rich quick? NO. But are they get-$50-for-binge-watching quick? Absolutely SHOCKINGLY close.

If you’re already scrolling in bed or critiquing every new social app update, you’re basically leaving cash on the table.

🚨 Real talk: Please, SOMEONE, explain why it took until 2025 for these to blow up. Have tech companies finally realized they should pay us for our feedback? Or is this the side hustle evolution we've all been manifesting? 😅

If you try only ONE thing, storm over to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and test drive their taste-making features. (That’s a 4th plug—because I’m in disbelief.)

Who else is testing these out already? Has anyone hit paydirt or even found one that *wasn't* legit?

Or am I the last to know, again? I’m still SHOCKED.

Comment below. I need answers, receipts, and more payout screenshots because I might just faint if there’s even more legit ones!",1,1755905335.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

I didn't think it would be this bad when moving in, especially considering we picked one specifically without an HOA. I was wrong.

It's so overstimulating. Every single day at least one of my 300 neighbours is getting something done to their home. Someone is always mowing a lawn, cutting down the one tree in their front yard, or getting their roof worked on. How are there construction crew trucks here every single day?? For the low low price of $500k (250 in 2021 when purchased), you too can live in a home where you don't get a single moment of peace. There's a loud car alarm going off every single day, kids are outside screaming 24/7, loud truck engines with no muffler at 5 in the morning. To top it all off, expect to never find a spot to park in front of your own if there's a holiday. 

I had to park my car almost half a block from my house on Mother's day. Honestly maybe I'd understand if it was an apartment complex you're renting at, but when you're paying $500k + property taxes + maintenance + bills I would at least like a parking spot. The streets are so narrow so when you're K-turning from the curb you can expect to be in an almost head on collision with another car going straight down that comes out of nowhere, driving the neighbourhood street at 35mph. Usually a 10 foot tall pickup truck because you really need all that in the New Jersey suburbs as a dentist!!


You get all the downside of living in a city, but none of the benefits. Sure there's a lot of places to spend money. But what difference does it make if you're somewhere rural with one nearby diner/coffee shop, versus 20 Dunkins in the suburbs? There aren't many authentic family businesses, just 15 locations of a Target and Dollar tree. It's crowded AF but nothing is made walkable. You have to take your car everywhere, and if your drive is 2 miles expect it to be at least 20 minutes of you just sitting there in stand still traffic from all the car accidents. I'm done.

I'm a childcare worker and will start my new job on the first of September. I'll be taking care of a child with ADHD. I love my work but it's still really draining. It's only part time because I accepted that I will never own a home lol.

I have tattoos of Avatar the last Airbender, Final Fantasy, Bayonetta and lil peep just to name a few. So if you like them too maybe we can share our favorite memories?

1mxlvlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mxlvlg/the_keepsake_by_tess_gerritsen/,The Keepsake By Tess Gerritsen,"Hey everyone,

I just finished reading Tess Gerritsen's ""The Keepsake,"" and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all, especially if you're looking for a good book to dive into or are perhaps new to reading thrillers. If you're curious, you can check out more about [The Keepsake By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/the-keepsake-by-tess-gerritsen/).

This book plunges you into a truly chilling mystery centered around an ancient mummy discovered by an archaeologist. The catch? The mummy is shockingly modern. What follows is a thrilling investigation led by medical examiner Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli, as they try to unravel who this modern mummy is and why she met such a bizarre, ancient-style end. It's a race against time as the killer might still be out there, replicating an old, terrible ritual. No spoilers here, but trust me, it gets intense!

What really hooked me about ""The Keepsake"" was Gerritsen’s masterful way of blending forensic science with a gripping, historical-tinged plot. Her medical background shines through, making all the details feel incredibly authentic and adding a layer of realism to the gruesome discoveries. I loved how the story unfolded, jumping between the present-day investigation and glimpses into the past, slowly revealing the chilling connections. The pacing was fantastic – it started strong and kept me glued to the pages, always wanting to know what disturbing revelation would come next. Maura Isles is such a compelling character; her analytical mind and quiet determination really anchor the story.

If I had to pick something that didn't quite resonate as much, perhaps a few of the secondary characters felt a little less developed compared to Maura and Jane. Sometimes, I wished for a deeper dive into their motivations, but honestly, that's a minor point in an otherwise excellent read. The primary focus on the mystery and the main characters was so strong that it hardly detracted from my enjoyment.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend ""The Keepsake"" to anyone who enjoys medical thrillers, forensic mysteries, or psychological fiction. If you like authors like Kathy Reichs or Patricia Cornwell, you’ll find yourself right at home with Tess Gerritsen. It’s a smart, suspenseful read that keeps you guessing until the very end. You can explore more about [The Keepsake By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/the-keepsake-by-tess-gerritsen/) if you're interested.

**A Little Guide for New Readers & Book Lovers!**

If you're just getting into reading, or maybe trying a new genre like thrillers, it can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming. But don't worry, it's really just about finding what you love! Here’s a little step-by-step guide and some personal tips to help you on your reading journey:

**Step-by-Step for Starting a New Book:**

1.  **Pick a Genre You Love:** Don't force yourself to read something just because it's popular. If you love fantasy, start there! If you want a good scare, try a thriller like ""The Keepsake.""

1mxlueb,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAccounts/comments/1mxlueb/he_was_the_good_boy/,He was the Good Boy,"My name is Nora Miller. I’m twenty-three, which is old enough to know better but still too young to actually do better. I moved to Lakeford last spring and took a job answering phones at a property management office. It pays the bills, and the air conditioner wheezes along just well enough to keep me from melting in the summer.

My nights are all the same: microwave dinners, collapsing on the couch, scrolling my phone until the blue light burns holes into my eyes. 

A few Saturdays ago, my roommates dragged me out of the apartment. “Dragged” is the right word. Kelsey and Brooke had already decided we were going out, and I was the cargo they had to haul.

The place was called The Boat-House. The name made it sound quaint, like somewhere you’d drink lemonade with your grandmother, but really it was wedged between a pawn shop and a tax office on Main. The entire block pulsed with bass and car exhaust.

Inside, the floor stuck to my shoes. Mason-jar lights dangled like drunk fireflies over the tables, and a chalkboard sagged above the bar with drink specials written in fat bubble letters. Everything was loud, hot, and ordinary. 

Safe enough.

I’m not built for crowds. I stuck to the wall like a damp leaf, holding my phone up as camouflage, pretending I had an urgent text from someone who didn’t exist.

Kelsey and Brooke were already two rounds in, shrieking with laughter, waving at me to join them on the dance floor. They looked like they belonged. I looked like someone trying not to be mistaken for a lost child.

So I clung to my drink.

When my friends ducked into the restroom, he slid into their space.

“Move over, sweetheart.”

He didn’t wait. He carved out space with his body, his size filling the air. Tall, shoulders squared like a fighter, hair clipped sharp like a catalog model. Shirt tight across muscle. The smell of soap and aftershave sliced through the swamp of spilled beer.

I edged an inch to the side. “I’m waiting for my friends.”

He flicked his eyes toward the restroom line. “Those two? They’ll be a while.” He drummed a finger against my glass. “What’s this?”

“Peach mule.”

“Cute,” he drawled. The word dangled in the air, smug and rough. Then he added, “Let me get you a real drink.”

“No thanks.” I shifted half around, a motion that should have ended things. It didn’t. He stayed planted, close enough that if I tried to leave I’d brush against him.

“Come on,” he coaxed, his smile sharpened thin. “Don’t be rude. I’m being friendly.”

“You’re blocking me in,” I said.

His smile changed like a door slamming shut. Quick. Cold. “I like to see what I’m buying.” His gaze crawled down my body, then back up, unhurried as a hand. “You come here often, Nora?”

My stomach knotted so hard it made me want to bend over. I hadn’t told him my name.

“Smile for me,” he said.

“No.”

That word landed like a stone dropped in water. His expression wavered, not anger but disappointment, as if he’d practiced a trick and I’d ruined the ending. He rolled his shoulders, leaning in, trying to loom taller than the room would let him.

“You don’t know me,” he said. His tone suggested that was a problem I ought to solve.

Before I could answer, someone else slipped into the space. Not loud. Not aggressive. Just present. Same height. Same eyes. Same face. For one dizzy second the world doubled, like I was looking through a warped mirror.

Twins.

“Stop,” the new one said. His voice was steady, the kind of steady that makes you want to trust it. “You’re scaring her.”

“I’m talking,” the first one snapped.

“You’re going too far.” The second one’s voice didn’t rise, but the weight in it carried. He turned to me for half a beat, and something in his face made the air feel easier. “I’m sorry. He does this.”

“I do what?” The first barked a laugh. “I’m being nice.”

“Your nice has teeth,” the second said. His tone dropped lower. “Walk.”

“You’re not my keeper.”

“Walk,” he repeated, softer, but with an edge that caught.

They stood squared, like warped reflections in a funhouse mirror. One rigid as steel rebar, the other loose, coiled, as if he could move either way. For one heartbeat I braced for fists to fly. Instead, the first clicked his tongue, shot me a glare, and dissolved back into the crowd.

The second stayed in place until his brother was fully gone, swallowed by the press of bodies. Only then did he step back, just enough that I could breathe again.

He let a breath slip from his lips. His voice was normal now, and tired. “He’s drunk. I should’ve stepped in sooner.”

“I’m fine.” My voice cracked. I cleared my throat and tried again. “Thanks.”

“Do you want some space? I can stick around, make sure he doesn’t circle back until your friends return.”

“That’s nice of you.” I pulled out my phone, thumb hovering over the rideshare app. “I think I’m going to head out.”

He nodded, like he understood. “Good idea.”

We stood in the kind of silence that should have been awkward but wasn’t. He kept his hands at his sides, no reaching, no angling in closer. He didn’t ask for my number. His eyes kept moving, sweeping the crowd like a guard dog watching over his pack.

“Does he do this a lot?” I asked finally. My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

“Often enough,” he said. “He thinks if he pushes long enough, the world just tips his way. Sometimes he’s right.” He shook his head. “Still not an excuse.”

“I don’t like being cornered.” The words slipped out sharp.

His mouth pressed thin. “I’m sorry you had to deal with him.”

Before I could answer, Kelsey appeared in a rush, cheeks bright red from laughing or liquor, with Brooke trailing like a kite tail behind her. “We’re closing out,” she announced, then squinted at me. “Are you okay? That guy looked like a total jerk.”

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, holding up my phone. “Calling a car.”

“I’ll wait with you,” the twin offered. He didn’t say it to me so much as he said it to my friends, like he was asking permission. “Just until it arrives.”

Kelsey narrowed her eyes, half protective, half nosy. “Do you know him?”

“No,” I said. Then I realized I wanted too. “But he’s okay.”

Something eased in his face, and he gave a small smile, the kind that tugged only one corner of his mouth. “I’ll stay five feet back. Scouts honor.”

We stepped outside into a wall of summer air, damp and sticky, the kind that clings to your skin like an unwanted hug. Smoke from someone’s cigarette curled across the sidewalk, blending with the tang of car exhaust. From across the street came the sound of a man juggling while a woman filmed him, her laughter drifting over traffic. 

“Text me when you get home,” Kelsey said, giving my shoulder a squeeze.

“I will,” I promised.

Then they were gone, back into the bar, their laughter swallowed by music. My app said seven minutes until my ride. 

“Again, I’m sorry about my brother,” he said. His voice had a weight to it, like this wasn’t the first apology he’d given. “It isn’t your job to deal with him.”

“It shouldn’t be yours either,” I said.

That got a laugh from him. “Somebody has to. He hunts for reactions. If he doesn’t get one, he just pushes harder.”

Then headlights swept over us. My ride. He stepped forward and opened the back door, then backed away again as if to prove he wasn’t going to press his luck.

“Thank you,” I said.

“Get home safe.”

I paused, one hand on the door. “What’s your name?”

He hesitated. “Cal.”

“I’m Nora.”

“It was nice to meet you, Nora.” The words came out awkward, as if he wasn’t used to meeting people.

“Can I give you my number?” he asked. His voice was careful, almost apologetic. “No pressure. Block me if you want.”

He said it like a hook, not a line. I held out my phone. He typed quickly, then stopped, hesitating. “Maybe I shouldn’t. I don’t want to push you.”

“It’s fine,” I said. “I asked your name, didn’t I?”

That coaxed the number onto the screen. He handed the phone back, watching me like I might suddenly regret it.

“I’ll head back inside after you go,” he said. “I don’t want to see my brother right now.”

“You don’t like him much.”

“I love him,” Cal answered, his voice gravel. “I just don’t like who he is when he’s prowling.”

That word lingered like smoke in my ear long after the car door shut.

At home, I sent two quick texts: one to Kelsey, one to him. *Made it. Thanks.*

His reply came back almost instantly. *Awesome, sleep well*

And that was all.

Two Saturdays later, just past noon, my phone lit up.

*Do you like tacos.*

The period at the end felt deliberate, like he had thought about it too much. I stared at the screen, amused and oddly nervous, then answered yes. A moment later he sent the name of a place on River Street, the kind with big windows that stared straight at the water. Seven o’clock.

I showed up early, because that is what I do, and lingered outside longer than I needed. The glass reflected my own face back at me, pale and uncertain, before I pushed inside.

He was already there. No grand gesture, no fake surprise, only a small wave, like he wasn’t entirely sure I’d come. His shirt was clean, plain jeans, and a baseball cap folded neatly on the seat beside him.

When I reached the table, he stood quickly and pulled out my chair, then looked embarrassed for it.

“I don’t go out much,” he admitted. “But I figured you’d be hungry.”

“I’m always hungry,” I said. That, at least, was true.

The air smelled of lime and fryer oil. My stomach growled in appreciation.

We ordered, and while we waited, he asked about my job. I told him the usual: broken water heaters, angry tenants, endless paperwork. Then I added how last week the office printer and fax machine had both died on the same day. My boss, who barely knew which end of a screwdriver to hold, was helpless. So I bought myself a little multi-tool keychain.

I showed him how the screwdriver folded out, gleaming in the restaurant light, and told him how it saved me from three hours of calling tech support.

“You carry that everywhere?” he asked.

“Now I do.”

His smile came fast and genuine.

I asked him about his life, the kind of questions that felt safe but still personal. He said he worked at a gym and helped coach high school wrestlers when the season rolled around. 

Then his phone buzzed on the table. He didn’t glance at it, only turned it face down like it might glare back.

“You can answer,” I said, thinking maybe it was important.

“It’s fine. Just Rhett.”

“Your brother?”

His mouth tightened. It wasn’t much, but enough to see. He gave a single nod. “Yeah.”

The food came then, mercifully, a pair of plates steaming with tacos. He attacked his with lime and hot sauce until the tortillas sagged under the weight. I laughed after my first bite sent half the filling sliding onto the plate in disgrace.

He wordlessly passed me a napkin, his mouth tugging into a crooked half-smile.

We swapped scraps of history. I told him about the town I grew up in, where the summer festival was just a parade of tractors dressed up with crepe paper. He chuckled, said he’d moved a lot as a kid. He didn’t offer reasons, and I didn’t press. 

His phone buzzed again, rattling faintly against the wood. This time he looked.

G.Boy: *Where are you*G.Boy: *Pick up*G.Boy: *We had plans*G.Boy: *Are you with her*

Cal locked the screen fast.

“Does he always talk to you like that?” I asked.

“When he’s been drinking,” Cal said, his face flashing regret like a ripple in water. “Sorry. Shouldn’t drag family stuff onto a date.”

“You didn’t,” I told him. “He did.”

That earned me a flicker of a smile before he pressed the phone face down again, the way you’d close a book you were tired of reading.

We lingered long after the plates had been cleared, until the waitress wiped every other table around us and began stacking chairs.

When the check came, he signed it without even glancing at the total. His fingers drummed the pen against the slip of paper, quick and restless, as if he were working up to a confession.

“I don’t want to go home tonight,” he said at last.

I thought about my own apartment. Kelsey and Brooke were probably already half-drunk with their music blasting, questions waiting like knives left out on the counter. The thought made me bold.

“We don’t have to go back to mine either,” I said. The words startled me even as they came out. “Why don’t we… go somewhere else? Maybe find a movie. In a room. Just us.” I caught his eyes and shrugged, as if to soften the suggestion.

For the first time that night his face lit up, sudden and boyish, like sunlight spilling over a wall. It pulled a laugh from me before I could stop it.

“Then yeah,” he said. “If you’re sure.”

“I’m sure.”

We drove in his truck with the windows cracked, warm air rushing in. The radio hummed soft. A pawprint bandanna dangled from the rearview mirror, fluttering like a tired flag every time the wind slipped in.

At the hotel desk he glanced at me first, waiting for the smallest nod before he asked for a room. The clerk didn’t bother to look up, just slid a keycard across the desk.

The room itself had the kind of characterless personality all hotel rooms share. A window that stared straight into the parking lot. A framed print of oranges in a bowl. He kicked off his shoes and sat gingerly on the edge of the bed, like he wasn’t sure if he should disturb the perfectly tucked blankets.

We turned on a movie and let it play in the background. He leaned back slowly, the tension in his shoulders easing the way ice cracks when spring finally warms the river.

When he reached for my hand, the touch was feather-light, as though he were asking a question instead of making a move.

“Stay,” he said. His voice was soft. “Only if you want to.”

“I want to.”

The kiss that followed was not cinematic. It was the kind of kiss two people share when they want the noise of the world to go away for a little while. He was careful, then not, the way care can slide so easily into hunger when you give yourself over to it. I won’t write the details. This isn’t that kind of forum, and it isn’t the point.

Later, much later, I woke in the dark to the blue blink of the cable box. His arm was heavy across my waist, the weight of it steady and anchoring. He slept the kind of sleep that looked earned, deep and unmoving.

My phone buzzed with a text from Kelsey: *Are you alive?*

I sent back a thumbs-up, then rolled my eyes. When I glanced at the dresser, Cal’s phone sat dark, a flat rectangle of trouble waiting to wake. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t need to. I already knew what would be waiting when he turned it back on.

In the morning, pale light slid through the curtains and turned the oranges in the framed print into little suns. He stretched, scrubbed a hand across his face and looked at me, not smiling exactly, but lighter than I had seen him before.

“You really are a sweetheart,” he said. His voice was deep, almost uncertain. Then, after a breath: “Can I see you again?”

I surprised myself by answering yes. The word came easier than I expected, like it had been waiting at the back of my throat all along.

Weeks passed, and we slipped into something that looked like dating even if neither of us named it. Coffee before my shift one morning, lukewarm and rushed but still enough to count. A walk by the river where the gnats glued themselves to our arms. I sent him pictures; he sent his own. Plain things. Good things. Quiet, no drama.

Then on Friday he texted: *Let me show you something, fresh start*

*Fresh start?* I typed back.

*From Rhett, I’m done picking up after him* 

The words hit me in the soft place under the ribs. *Okay,* I wrote. *I’ll be there.*

That night we sat on a bench by the river, sandwiches unwrapped on our laps. The water was the color of tea as the sun folded itself behind the warehouses. Cal kept studying my face like he was reading a gauge, and I only realized why when he reached out and brushed his thumb near my cheek. I’d been carrying a streak of mustard like a mask.

“I did it,” he said.

“Did what?”

“I’m not living with him anymore.”

“You moved?” The words tumbled out too fast, too eager.

“For now I’m on my boss’s couch. Nothing special, but Rhett doesn’t have a key.”

“He’ll be mad.”

“He already is. That’s not your problem.” His eyes stayed on mine. “I wanted you to know before we decide anything. I want to see where this goes.”

“I’d like that,” I said. “To see.”

His smile then was small, unpolished, but real.

“Fresh start?” he asked.

“Fresh start,” I echoed.

“Come on,” he said suddenly. “Let me show you my shop.”

“Your shop?”

“Technically my boss’s,” he admitted. “But after hours the bays are mine, as long as I keep the place clean.”

I blinked at him. “So you’re a wrestling coach and a mechanic?”

For just a second his expression faltered. A tiny pause, as if the question had thrown sand in his gears. Then something shifted behind his eyes, quick and hard to name, and he smoothed it away with a shrug.

“Yeah. Off-season,” he said, voice too casual. “Gives me a little more free time.” He tacked on a smile, easy and weightless.

The shop was tucked behind a row of storage units, their numbers painted on crooked like they had been added by a drunk with a brush. White siding scuffed from years of weather, the roll-up doors chained shut.

He flicked a switch inside. Rows of tube lights buzzed to life overhead, sputtering before they caught. 

“This is where you disappear to when you vanish on me?” I asked.

“It’s my therapy,” he said. His hand brushed the edge of a workbench. “Cheaper than the other kind.”

He led me past a Camaro on jack stands, its insides stripped bare. Next to it sat an old F100 in gray primer, the kind of truck that still remembered farm fields. Near the sink, a battered radio waited. He turned the dial, coaxing it to life, and soft vintage music spilled out. The sound felt too gentle for the shop, like lace in a barn.

“You do all this?” I trailed a finger over a door panel polished smooth as a seashell.

“With help,” he said. “I’m good at the boring parts. Now sit,” he said, patting the fender. “Tell me three things you’d do if money didn’t matter.”

The question caught me off guard. I thought for a moment. “I’d fix the dangling light in my apartment so it stops swinging every time the neighbors stomp upstairs. I’d learn how to make bread that doesn’t double as a brick. And…” My eyes swept over the rows of cars, parts scattered like puzzle pieces. “I’d buy a car that actually starts when I need it to.”

His grin came quick, flashing in the pale shop light. “We can handle one and three tonight.”

I laughed, shaking my head. “The bread’s still the dream. But I’ll settle for a car.”

“Then come with me.” Cal’s voice carried across the shop. He stood beside the Chevelle. “Pop the hood release on your side. We’ll pretend she’s yours.”

I tugged the handle and the hood rose slowly, creaking like something waking from a long nap. Cal leaned in with an ease that suggested this was his church and the engine his altar.

He pointed out belts, lines, reservoirs, explaining each one as if he were translating a foreign language. Complicated things became simple in his mouth, and the shop lights caught in his eyes as he bent closer.

I found myself watching him more than the machine. There was no show in it, no swagger. He wasn’t performing for me. He was sharing, and that was better.

Then the side door rattled.

Cal paused. “I locked that,” he murmured, the words meant more for himself than for me.

A second noise followed. The faint kiss of rubber on concrete. Then nothing.

“Probably a cat,” I offered. 

He didn’t answer. Instead, he moved forward, shoulders tight, angling his body so I was tucked behind him. His gaze fixed on the shadow pooled near the stacked tires.

“Stay here.”

“Cal-” I started, but he was already moving. His hand closed over a heavy flashlight on the bench, and with a sharp click he sent a beam cutting across the concrete.

Dust rose and sparkled in the light, like tiny insects caught in amber. The beam slid across crates, a blue tarp sagging over something bulky, the long metal leg of the lift.

Then something moved. A dart of black slipping fast between the cars.

Cal froze mid-step. I did too, every muscle in my body caught in that same stillness.

“Who’s there?” His voice had dropped, deep enough that the words seemed to drag along the floor.

The answer came in the form of a shape, peeling itself out of the shadow between the lifts.

It was tall. Broad. A mask covered its head. Nothing playful or cheap about it. Black leather formed into a snout, seams stitched tight like scars. Metal rings caught the flashlight beam, gleaming cold. Silver studs lined the jaw where teeth should have been, giving the illusion of a mouth that could never close.

It breathed, but the sound came out warped, dragged through rubber, rasping like air caught in a funnel.

Dog, but not a dog. Human, but not human.

The figure tilted its head, a slow, unnatural angle, as though considering which way to peel the skin from a problem. In one hand it gripped a wrench, short and heavy, its weight obvious even in the beam of the flashlight. The other hand dangled, loose and patient, as if waiting its turn.

“Rhett,” Cal said. The name left his mouth like a stone, heavy. “Take it off.”

The mask gave nothing back. But the body inside it moved.

He lunged forward, fast enough to blur. Cal’s hand caught mine, shoving me aside so hard my hip cracked against the corner of a bench.

“Behind me,” he snapped.

The figure kept advancing.

“Rhett,” Cal said again, his voice flat now, stripped of anything kind. “Take it off.”

The head tilt lingered, then the wrench lifted, and the figure closed the distance in a skater’s glide, smooth and practiced.

Cal met him in the middle. Metal struck with a sharp, ringing crack. The wrench smashed down on the flashlight, bursting its light in a single brittle pop that rattled my teeth. Cal threw his shoulder into the figure’s chest, driving with force enough to push him back two long steps, the rubber soles screeching over concrete like tires losing grip.

“Run!” Cal barked. His eyes never flicked from the figure. “Side door!”

My body moved before my brain caught up. I bolted, heart hammering, only to find a thick chain looped through the push bar. My stomach dropped so hard I thought I’d be sick. That chain hadn’t been there when we came in.

I clawed at the hook, fingers slipping, nails scraping against cold metal. It wouldn’t give. The door stayed stubborn and solid beneath my weight.

“Try the other door!” Cal’s voice was tight with effort. He was backing up toward the bay, his body a barrier between me and the mask.

I sprinted to the roll-up, seized the dangling chain, and hauled. It rattled in my palms, strong and thick. The door groaned, lifted an inch, then jammed with a violent shudder. The lock bars were still thrown.

Behind me the men moved in a circle, both predators. The masked figure feinted left, then darted right, fast as a snake. Cal tracked him step for step, the symmetry almost obscene, as if they’d rehearsed this dance a hundred times before.

“Top latches!” Cal shouted. “Both sides!”

I reached up, fingertips scraping cold metal until they caught the first latch. It gave with a stubborn click. I fumbled for the second, popped it free, and the door jolted upward.

I grabbed the chain and hauled. The door groaned and rose a little higher, half a foot maybe, before freezing in place. A slice of orange streetlight poured through the gap, narrow as a knife wound.

Dropping to my knees, I shoved my shoulder into the opening, grease smearing my shirt as I tried to wriggle under. The gap bit into my ribs. I couldn’t fit.

“Too small!” I gasped.

“Shit,” Cal snapped behind me.

The masked figure swung its head toward me. The silver studs lining its muzzle caught the light, sharp as fangs. Each breath rasped wet and hollow, the sound of something dragging air through broken plastic tubing.

“Eyes on me, Rhett,” Cal growled. The figure lunged toward him, swinging the wrench, and Cal slipped just out of reach.

“Office hall!” he barked, never looking at me. “Break room, past the soda machine!”

I spotted the hulking soda machine and lunged for the nearest door. It swung open into a cramped room: a scarred table, an old microwave, a corkboard cluttered with yellowed softball flyers. No exit.

“Keep moving, Nora! Door at the end!” Cal’s shout was closer now, ragged with strain.

My lungs burned, fire running up my throat as I shoved through a swinging gate and into a narrow aisle of shelves. Boxes and bins rose higher than my shoulders, each one labeled in blocky handwriting. Fuses. Hose clamps. Springs.

I turned left and spotted the gray door waiting at the very end of the aisle. My hand closed around the handle, slick with sweat, and I yanked it open with all the hope in the world that it led outside.

It didn’t.

The smell hit first. Bleach overlaid with something coppery, sharp as a coin pressed against water. 

The space was bare, windowless. A rolling stool stood crooked near the wall. In the center, a drain darkened the concrete. A pegboard hung heavy with tools, their outlines traced in black marker so no piece could ever go missing. On a shelf sat a pack of zip ties, a roll of duct tape, a tarp folded neatly.

And there, anchored dead-center, was a chair bolted into the floor.

Behind me, the latch gave a soft click.

I spun toward the doorway. Cal stood there, breath coming heavy, sweat darkening the collar of his shirt. For half a heartbeat I thought relief might flood me. Until his eyes caught mine and shifted. Not much. Just enough to tell me something was off.

“You made good time,” he said, letting out a breathless laugh that didn’t belong in the moment.

The hinges groaned again. Another figure shouldered past him. Rhett. The wrench dangled from his hand, tapping a lazy rhythm against his thigh. With one hand he dragged the mask halfway up, baring a grin underneath, wide and shining with spit.

“You should’ve seen your face,” he panted. “Perfect.”

My back hit the sheet wall before I even realized I was moving. “This isn’t funny,” I managed. “What the hell is this?”

“Oh, it’s hilarious,” Cal said. His grin was creeping wide, the kind boys wear when they’ve hidden in someone’s closet and can’t wait for the scream.

Rhett’s shoulders shook beneath his leather jacket. His voice came muffled but bright, like static through a speaker. “She’s great,” he said. “Better than the last one.”

“The last one?” My tone barely carried.

Cal tilted his head, studying me the way someone studies a caged animal they’ve spent weeks fattening up. “Yeah. It’s a family tradition. One of us plays the bad boy, the other plays the good boy. We take turns. Keeps things interesting.”

“Cal,” I said, my voice breaking around the name. I wanted it to matter. I wanted to believe if I said it enough times, the man who smiled shyly over tacos would step back into his skin. “You don’t have to do this.”

His answer was laughter, piercing and echoing, ricocheting off the metal walls like loose nails in a dryer. “Don’t have to?” he repeated, eyes wild with the joy of it. “Nora, this is what we do.” He craned his head, and the apology I’d once trusted was gone, burned out of him. “Don’t get me wrong. You’ve been fun.”

Rhett stepped forward, mask tugged low again, his voice slipping into a cartoon snarl. “But not as fun as what comes next.” He spread his arms wide, inviting the room to applaud. “Welcome to the show.”

Cal reached for the switch and slid the dimmer low. The light shrank until the corners of the room pressed in. “We like to give the full experience.”

Rhett moved in wide circles around me like a wolf testing the edge of the pen. He stopped beside the heavy chair planted in the center of the room and slapped the backrest with a flat crack of palm against metal. “She’ll look perfect right here, won’t she, Cal?” His head bobbed with a cocky rhythm as he leaned on the chair. “Tell me, Nora. What’s your favorite scary movie? How does it end?”

Cal’s eyes caught the thin light. “She likes happy endings,” he said. “That’s why she picked me.”

The two of them broke into a holler, the sound of boys who had found a new cruelty to share in.

I edged backward from the chair until my calves knocked into the lip of a rolling table. My hand slid over the surface, searching blindly, until it closed around something with weight. A screwdriver, long and solid.

Rhett noticed the shift in my eyes and wagged a gloved finger at me like I was a child reaching for a cookie jar. “Ah-ah. Hands where I can see them.”

“Let her take it,” Cal said. His voice was almost sweet.

I lifted the screwdriver, knuckles white around the handle. My hands looked steady. Or maybe I only prayed they did.

“Cal.” My grip tightened around the screwdriver. “Move.”

His mouth curved in something too sweet to be real. “We’re past that, Nora.”

I told myself I’d drive the blade into him if he got close enough. I told myself I’d be quick. He studied me a moment, then stepped forward, almost tenderly, like someone coaxing a child out of a tantrum.

“Go on,” Rhett urged, his voice a coaxing growl. “Do it. Stab him. He’s right there.”

I lunged. The screwdriver cut a straight line for Cal’s ribs. But he was faster. His hand snapped out, clamped around my wrist, and twisted until the pain screamed up my arm. My fingers betrayed me, opening on their own. The screwdriver clattered to the floor and rolled away.

“Atta girl!” Rhett barked through the mask, his gloved palms smacking together in a mockery of applause. “She really tried.”

Cal nudged the fallen screwdriver with the side of his boot and sent it skittering across the floor into shadow. “Knew you’d swing, Nora. Good for you.”

Before I could grab anything else, Rhett came in from the side like a bear lunging at its prey. His arms clamped around my ribs and lifted me as if I were nothing more than a doll. He slammed me down into the metal chair. The back of my skull smacked hard against the steel frame, and for a moment the room smeared at the edges. “Sit still, sweetheart.” 

Cal crouched close, his eyes glinting in the half-light, slick and dark as river stones. “Wrists first, Rhett. Don’t bruise her too much. She’s got to look good for the finale.”

Rhett grunted in agreement and bore down. The first tie cinched tight around my wrists, biting until my fingers went numb. Another loop yanked my ankles together, locking with a sharp scream of plastic teeth. I jerked hard, but the cords only dug deeper, cutting little half-moons into my skin.

“There we go,” Rhett said, straightening and admiring his work. “All snug.”

Cal stood and dragged a folded tarp from the shelf and shook it open, the plastic crackling as he spread it flat across the concrete. 

I forced myself to breathe slow. Keep still. Keep my face slack, as if I had already given up. While their backs were turned, I shifted just enough to work my fingers toward my pocket. My keys dug into my palm, sharp edges biting until I found what I wanted: the little multitool I never left behind.

I bent my wrists awkwardly, sawing the tiny blade against the tie. The jagged edge scraped plastic, each grind loud in my head.

Cal leaned on the workbench and swiped the back of his wrist across his damp forehead. “You wanna know why we hate you?”

“No,” I snapped, the word tasting bitter.

He ignored it. His voice stayed even, almost bored. “Because women like you are weak. They fold. Our mom was proof of that. Rolling through town in her chair, useless. Couldn’t talk, just cried.”

To punctuate it, he made a low, broken keening sound from the back of his throat. Rhett’s head jerked at the noise like a dog catching a whistle. Then he added his own note, a high-pitched yip, answering like they’d rehearsed it.

“You’re sick,” My voice shook and Cal’s voice lost its false calm, rough edges spilling through. 

“We fed her, cleaned her up, and listened to her whimper every single day. You know what that does to a kid?”

Rhett swung the wrench in the air like a baton. “And our [father ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5swpqf/the_handler/)made her that way. Took her tongue so all she could do was bark. Taught her to heel like a mutt. That’s what we grew up with. Not a mother. A dog.”

“She wasn’t weak,” I said, twisting against the ties until the cords bit deeper. “She survived.”

Cal scoffed, cruel and curt. “Survived? She begged for scraps like a stray. Lived in his shadow even after he rotted in prison. You call that surviving?”

Rhett slammed the wrench against the wall. The clang bounced through the room. “We crawled on all fours when we were kids,” he said, his voice breaking into something raw. “Barked right along with her. Didn’t even know it was wrong. We were her pups. That’s what Dad called us in his letters. His bitch and his pups.” For a moment his swagger slipped. Then he snapped it back. “You know he never called us sons? Not once.”

Cal laid a length of chain across the tarp, straightening each link with neat little tugs. “So we made our own kind of family bonding time. This. Our hunt. Our turn. And we’re better at it than he ever was.”

They stared at each other then, feeding on the ugliness between them.

I pressed the tool harder into the edge of the tie. One thread snapped, then another. I kept my face slack.

Cal leaned close, his breath hot on my cheek. “You’ll break the same way she did. They all do.”

My eyes stayed down while the little teeth of the multitool chewed through more plastic. Eventually the zip tie gave way with a tiny crack, soft as a twig snapping underfoot. I froze, forcing my freed wrist to hang limp so they wouldn’t see. A quick flex sent blood rushing back into my hand, pins and needles stinging, but I kept my expression blank. Ankles still bound. Arms free.

Cal picked up a pair of pliers. His eyes glazed and bright at once, like something fevered that had found a flame. “So,” he murmured, snapping the pliers open and shut, “ready to beg, Nora?”

“Not yet,”

His mouth curled at the ends. “We’ll get there.” He clicked the pliers again, close enough the air in front of my nose cracked.

Rhett leaned over the back of the chair, peering at me like a child admiring a trapped bug. “I like her,” he said, voice muffled under the mask. “She’s making us work for it.”

Cal’s tone slid down, almost coaxing. “Don’t worry, Nora. Once you break, it’ll be quick. Quicker than most.”

I lifted my chin, the words spilling out before I could think better. “You’re pathetic. Your dad owns you.”

Something awful flashed in Cal’s eyes. He leaned in close enough for me to feel the tension off him. “Careful, bitch.”

I didn’t give myself the chance to hesitate. My hand came up fast, the multitool’s jagged teeth already biting at the air. Cal’s eyes went wide, but not wide enough. I drove the blade into his left eye with every ounce of strength I had left.

The sound was wrong. A wet, meaty pop, followed by a howl that seemed to rattle the bolts in the walls. He reeled backward, both hands flying to his face, blood seeping hot and fast through his fingers.

“Jesus Christ!” Rhett’s voice cracked, the wrench slipping from his grip and clattering against the floor. He lunged toward his brother. “Cal! Oh my God, she-”

“She got me,” Cal croaked. His voice was ragged, broken at the edges. “That bitch got me.” Blood poured down his cheek in a dark curtain, soaking his shirt, dripping to the floor in fat drops. He started to laugh even as the sound wavered with pain. “She really did it. She really fucking did it!”

They were caught up in each other, Cal shrieking, Rhett fumbling to hold him, both too busy drowning in their own chaos to notice me. That was the only opening I was ever going to get.

I wrenched my legs sideways, twisting until the plastic cut into my skin. The tie at my right ankle gave with a sharp snap. I bent forward, working the bloody tool against the other, sawing in frantic jerks until the plastic finally split.

I lurched up from the chair, half stumble, half desperate run, my legs screaming with pins and needles.

Rhett’s head snapped toward me. “Hey!”

“Get her!” Cal bellowed, clutching the ruin of his eye with both hands, blood streaking down his arm. 

The hallway smeared around me, my vision tunneling as I ran. My shoes slid on patches of oil, every step a fight to stay upright. I dragged one hand along the wall, scraping skin raw just to keep my balance.

Rhett’s laugh echoed after me, high and giddy, like a child on a carnival ride. “She’s fast! This is great!”

I burst through the break room, nearly tripping over the edge of a chair, shoved hard against the soda machine, and bolted into the narrow hall. The side door glared at me like salvation. The chain still coiled through the bar. I clawed at it, nails splitting back, breath wheezing in my throat. Not locked, just knotted. It slipped once, my fingers sliding off slick with sweat. I yanked again and the knot came free.

The bar shoved forward and the door flew wide.

The night air hit me full in the face, crisp and damp, like being slapped with a wet sheet. I ran harder, legs pumping without rhythm, body all panic. Behind me the door banged open, and their voices spilled into the dark, yowling and wild, the sound of hunters too drunk on the chase.

“Run, Nora!” Rhett’s voice cracked with glee.

The lot stretched open, a flood of orange light from the street lamps making every shadow look thinner. I wove between parked cars, ducking low, lungs tearing themselves raw. My vision tunneled until it felt like I was running down a dark pipe. I screamed, over and over, because it was all I had left.

I aimed myself at the glow of the corner lamp, as if the yellow light could burn them away. I didn’t dare look behind me.

A porch light snapped on across the road. Someone shouted, startled and sharp. “Hey! What’s going on?”

“Help!” My throat tore with it. “Call the police! Please!”

Doors opened in a scatter. More lights came up. A woman stood framed in her doorway, phone clutched. “I’m calling 911!”

The night behind me stayed empty.

Sirens began as a faint whine, then swelled until the sound filled my chest. My legs gave out. I crumpled onto the first porch I reached, knees buckling, body shaking so violently I couldn’t keep upright.

The woman with the phone knelt close. She didn’t touch me, her hand hovering in the air like she was afraid one wrong move would shatter me completely.

“They’re coming,” she whispered. “You’re safe now.”

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to, but my body wouldn’t stop trembling.

At the station I spoke until my throat gave out, the words rasping like sand. I told them everything: the shop, the chair, the mask, the chains. I said their names over and over so no one could pretend they hadn’t heard me. And when I got to the part about the screwdriver, about driving it into Cal’s eye, I sat up straighter. I told them he’d be bleeding badly, that they wouldn’t be able to miss him.

The police went through the shop like ants through sugar, flooding every corner with flashlights. They found the chair bolted to the floor, the chains dangling like dead snakes, the tarp spread neat and waiting. Bits of cut zip ties still curled on the ground, and the screwdriver lay where it had skittered out of reach.

But there were no brothers. No mask. No blood trail leading out the door. Cal and Rhett had already slipped into the dark. 

They still haven’t caught them. Not yet. Somewhere out there, Cal and Rhett are slinking through the cracks of this town, waiting for the right hole to crawl into. But they’re not the same anymore. I did that. Cal’s eye is gone. The mirror between them is broken.

I found out that a couple weeks ago Starbucks has changed their chocolate cold foam recipe and will no longer be shipping malt powder. Starbucks has drastically cut back on their syrup offerings and I understand this will be easier on the baristas and help with wait times. BUT with limited syrup offerings I was happy to discover I really liked the chocolate cold foam. I went in a couple weeks ago to order my treat: Chocolate Cream Cold Brew, no vanilla syrup, Sub Hazelnut. 

  
There's a brand new store 3 miles from me. I ordered my drink and I knew right away it was wrong because the cold foam just sank into the drink AND it tasted horrible: thin, grainy and the chocolate didn't taste right. Well, I went to another store that I know made it right. Saw the same thing, asked bout it and was told that Starbucks was no longer sending malt powder and that the recipe is permanently changed. I'm pissed and annoyed. 

Well. Tonight I think I made a great substitution. I own a Secura milk brother/heater off Amazon. Cheap and amazing. Here's what I tried just now to make Chocolate Cream Cold Foam:

2 Pumps Vanilla Syrup (Starbucks)

Heavy Whipping Cream poured just below the top of the whisk (1/3 cup??? I eyeballed it)

A little bit of 2% milk (2 Tbsp.? Eyeballed it)

1 Tbsp of OVALTINE chocolate MALT powder

1 Tbsp of OVALTINE RICH CHOCALTE MIX

  
Hit the button to froth, 2x.

1. Am I dumb for wanting to skip Kyoto and Osaka for first time trip?
2. We'll be there for 9 full days. Could I stay overnight in more than one region or should I stick to only exploring the prefectures in one region (e.g. I've seen Tohoku frequently mentioned as less crowded)?
3. How many different prefectures could I **stay overnight** in over the course of 9 days or should I stay in one spot and just do day trips? (I don't want to go too hard and exhaust ourselves).

Hi everyone, my spouse and I are flying to Japan for a short trip this fall (arriving 11/1 and leaving 11/11 so roughly 9 full days there) and it's our first time visiting. I have been doing a lot of research and feel good about getting around but am really overwhelmed by the sheer number of amazing places to visit. I know that most people do the big three on their first trip (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka) but I am tempted to totally skip Kyoto and Osaka and go somewhere less traveled... we've learned from past experiences that neither of us love the typical tourist hot-spots that everyone else seems to enjoy. To be clear, it's not like I'm totally trying to avoid other tourists because I know that's impossible (and I have nothing against tourism obviously), it's more that I would love to experience quieter spots and experience Japan ""like a local"" as much as possible.

I know this type of question has been asked a thousand times (I've been all over this subreddit) but I guess I'm hoping someone reads this who has similar priorities/interests and can give me advice or recs based on their own experiences.

It started of as those casual highschool friendships where you talk a handful of times, ate lunch with a shared group of friends and occasionally hungout outside of school. We pivoted to ""best friend"" status during junior year. It was good (outside of our mom's hating each other) and we remained friends.

I noticed little things during highschool. I'd refuse to talk crap about her even when pissed off and she'd openly say she'd ""talked shit"" about me and that ""was how our friendship was"". I'd always carried snacks for her diabetes and she'd....just give my advice on how my mother (our relationship is not the best) didnt love me as much as my siblings. I comforted her through her breakups and she'd sit there and awkwardly try to comfort me that one time after a nasty argument with my mom. Her parents added me on to their phone bill and got me a phone so me getting my first big girl job was easier (which I am still grateful for) and I paid my phone bill and fully reimbursed them for the phone after getting said job. She'd gift me things for birthdays and holidays and casually mentioned it from time to time (all on her parents dime btw)  and once I was making more money, I'd started gifting back to her. She'd start saying ""oh this is payback for all the times I bought you stuff"" in a joking matter. Which, felt off at the time but I thought I was being too paranoid.

She's started borrowing money from me on a regular basis which she hasn't paid me back yet. Like she just got her first job while I've been working since I was 20 (my mother let me sit in her house while I was in college as long as I gave her my left over financial aid money after the semester ended). She only contacts me for money now and days and to talk about the guy she's staying with . Last time I checked (I kept records) we were at almost $800. I didn't mind letting her borrow money from at first because she's affectively homeless and staying with the guy she's currently in a situationship. She complains about having no money to eat (I then let her borrow money) but then in the same breath say she has to pay her Disney plus subscription. I get it she works part-time at a gas station, it's not like my first job wasn't a shitty part-time. It's just that Everytime we hangout I foot the bill. I pay for food, snacks and recently I bought her work clothes for her first job (the gas station one).

She doesn't want to hangout with me anymore. We'll have plans, I get ready and head out to where we're supposed to meet and suddenly her diabetes drops ""dangerously low"" but then after she'll text me about not being able to hangout meanwhile she's posting on Instagram or let it slip in later conversation  that she hungout with someone else. Like, I get it your diabetes hates extreme changes in the weather but to them play in my face and pretend like I'm the clingy paranoid one just fucking sucks. But then when I want to hangout with a friend I haven't spoken with in a while, she'll call me crying about ""how her best friend is replacing her"" (referring to the guy she's living with) and no one wants to hangout anymore (referring to me overworking myself so I can move out of my mother's house) or how ""no one wants to talk to me"". Meanwhile, I asked her the day prior if she wanted to hangout and get coffee (I even offered to pay) and she told me know because it was too hot (it was 67°F in NYS).

Every time I try to end it she goes off about how ""I villainized her"" and breaks down crying. I'd feel bad and retract what I've said.

I am utterly lost. Do I dead this friendship and become the person who ""betrayed"" her (God forbid someone holds you accountable for the shitty things you do sometimes) or do I holdout and see if she attempts to change?",2,1755904728.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

Embers of A New Dawn

Chapter 1
Sophie Wilson loved Daniel Carter for a lifetime. 

As she neared the end, Daniel held her hand, tears streaming down his face. 

She thought it would be a final confession of love. 

But then Daniel sighed, ""Sophie, being your husband this lifetime was exhausting. I just want to live with Lily in Seaside Village as a plain fisher.""

In that moment, Sophie forgot how to breathe. 

The Lily he spoke of was the fisherwoman who found him years ago in Seaside Village. She lied, claiming to be his wife, and kept him hidden, living as a couple. 

When Sophie found him, Daniel, who had lived in poverty for so long, remembered everything. He didn't spare Lily Harvey a glance and returned with Sophie to the Carter family. 

He gave her a grand wedding, promising to stay by her side forever. 

But now, as Sophie lay dying, her husband told her he regretted it. 

1

Sophie went to the city hall as the first thing after her rebirth. 

""Hello, I'd like to know if I can replace a lost marriage certificate,"" she said. 

She watched the clerk, tense and hopeful. 

Every second of waiting felt like torture. 

Daniel's words from her deathbed echoed in her ears. 

She desperately needed to know it was a dying delusion or the truth. 

""Sorry, ma'am,"" the clerk looked up, polite. ""There's no record of your marriage in the system. You were never registered.""

""No... registered marriage?"" Sophie repeated the words softly, her eyes burning. 

She lowered her head and smiled. 

Of course. 

The Carter family had fooled her from the start. 

They gave her a fake marriage certificate, using her and Wilson family's resources for their gain. 

In that long marriage, Daniel seemed to love her passionately, but something always felt off. 

She had her doubts, but Daniel brushed them off, saying his memory loss had changed him, that it was normal. 

On her deathbed, tubes everywhere, with only hours left, Daniel spoke the truth. 

He said, ""Sophie, sometimes I wish you hadn't found me. I could've stayed Danny the fisher, happy in Seaside Village. Being your husband was exhausting. Being the Carter heir was exhausting.""

He paused, gazing out the window, his eyes soft. ""In the next life, I want to live carefree with Lily in Seaside Village.""

Looking back, it was laughable. 

Even more laughable, when the Carter family faced its worst crisis, Wilson family used every connection and resource to stabilize Daniel's position. 

Yet less than a year after her death, Daniel ruthlessly took over her family's company. The elders who fought for the Carters were all pushed out. 

The marriage Sophie devoted her life to destroyed her family. 

""So... it was true."" Sophie laughed until tears fell. 

The rain had stopped when she left city hall. 

She stood on the street and tore the fake marriage certificate to pieces without hesitation. 

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, the screen flashing with Norvo Medical Academy. 

Months ago, an overseas mentor invited her to continue her medical studies. 

In her past life, she declined for Daniel, locking her scalpel in a drawer forever. 

She locked herself away too. 

She stared at the screen, took a deep breath, and pressed accept. 

""Sophie, are you sure you won't reconsider?"" The professor's kind voice came through. 

""Professor,"" she said. ""I'm in. I'll handle the paperwork and be there in a month.""


Chapter 2
When Sophie pushed open the door, a pair of handmade cloth shoes at the entrance stung her eyes. 

Lily had made them, and in her past life, Daniel hid them deep in the closet. 

Yet during Sophie's illness, he dug them out, placing them by her bedside, touching them day and night. 

They disgusted her until her final breath. 

The living room glowed with warm yellow light. Daniel sat slumped on the sofa, hands repeatedly clutching his knees. 

At the sound of footsteps, he snapped his head up, eyes filled with wariness and confusion, like a wild animal lost in a bustling city. 

He didn't know where he was or whether the person before him meant harm. 

This place felt terrifying, nothing like the warmth of Seaside Village. 

""Who are you?""

Sophie's heart felt gripped by an icy hand, cold and painful. 

This was the Daniel just brought back. 

He couldn't even tell if he was Daniel or Danny. 

""I'm Sophie."" She approached him, deliberately holding her breath. 

The faint salty scent of the sea clung to him, a smell she disliked. 

It belonged to Lily and Seaside Village. 

Daniel frowned, straining to recall the name, but only shook his head. ""I don't know you. They say you're my fiancée, no... they say we're already married. Is that true?""

Sophie let out a bitter laugh. 

He didn't remember. 

He only remembered Lily. 

He didn't care how much effort the Wilson and Carter families poured into finding him. 

""Do you want to go back to Seaside Village?""

Daniel's eyes lit up instantly, like a spark catching fire. ""Yes! Of course I do!""

He shot to his feet, knocking over a glass on the coffee table in his haste. Water soaked the expensive rug, but he didn't notice. ""I don't want to stay here, learning all these rules, listening to old men drone about company business. I just want to go back, fish with Lily, and lie on the boat at night watching the stars. 

I'm not Daniel Carter. I'm Danny the fisher!""

He spoke Danny the fisher with such ease, as if it were his true, born identity. 

Sophie looked at the pure longing in his eyes and felt the absurdity of it all. ""I can take you to see it.""

Daniel cheered instantly. 

Sophie took him on a boat to Seaside Village. 

The sea breeze carried a briny tang, and Daniel leaned eagerly over the railing. 

At the dock, several women in rough cloth clothes mended nets. Their eyes lit up at the sight of Daniel, then shifted to Sophie with hostility. 

""Ain't that Danny? You're finally back!"" A stout woman spoke first, her tone warm but her gaze slicing over Sophie like a blade. ""And who's this? All dressed up, some fancy city lady?""

Before Daniel could respond, a young woman grabbed a bucket of seawater and splashed it over Sophie. 

The icy water soaked her clothes instantly, salty droplets dripping from her hair onto her ch**t. 

""You wicked woman! Breaking up a sweet couple like that!"" The young woman stood with hands on hips, face full of anger. ""If you hadn't dragged Danny away, he'd be married to Lily by now! You made her cry for days, and you've got the nerve to show up here!""

More people crowded around, their accusations piling on. 

""Exactly! Our Lily's such a good girl, waiting for Danny all this time!""

""City women are just rotten, can't stand to see others happy!""

""Danny, don't let this kind of woman fool you!""

Sophie stood there, drenched and disheveled. 

She looked up at Daniel. 

But Daniel only frowned, staring at the chaotic scene, his lips moving slightly. ""Hey... don't do this. Where's Lily?""


Chapter 3
Daniel led Sophie deeper into Seaside Village. 

He seemed oblivious to her silence, lost in his own nostalgic tales of the village. 

""Look at that old oak tree,"" he said, pointing to a lush, leafy tree nearby. ""When I first got to the village, I came down with a high fever. Lily carried me three kilometers over the hills to find a doctor. We stopped to rest under that tree. Her hands were sweaty, but she kept asking if I was cold."" ""And that rocky beach at the village entrance,"" he continued. ""It's dangerous at high tide, but Lily wasn't scared. She's a strong swimmer.""

The Lily Harvey he described was kind, her heart and eyes full of him. 

Sophie kept her gaze lowered. 

Kind? 

If Lily was truly kind, she wouldn't have hidden Daniel in this remote village when the Carter family used every resource and offered a hefty reward to find him, cutting him off from his family entirely. 

""We're almost there."" Daniel stopped, pointing to a low tiled house ahead. 

Fishing nets hung in the yard, and strings of dried fish dangled under the eaves, the air thick with the damp, briny smell of the sea. 

The door stood slightly ajar, and a faint cough came from inside. 

Daniel pushed it open, barely containing his joy. ""Lily, I'm back.""

At his words, a figure rushed out from the house. 

When she saw Daniel at the door, she froze. 

""Danny?"" Her voice trembled, tears welling up instantly. ""How... how are you back?""

Before Daniel could respond, Lily threw herself at him, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist, her face buried in his ch**t, sobbing. ""I thought... I thought I'd never see you again in this life. They said your family found you, that you went back to the big city, that you'd never come back.""

Her cries carried grievance and fear, as if Daniel's return was a treasure reclaimed. 

Daniel, held tightly, instinctively patted her back, his voice soft. ""I'm back, Lily. I didn't leave.""

Sophie stood at the gate, watching the two locked in a tight embrace, feeling the absurdity of it all. 

She watched quietly until Lily seemed to notice her, lifting a tear-streaked face. Her gaze landed on Sophie, now sharp with wariness and hostility. ""Why... why is she here?""

Daniel glanced back at Sophie, looking conflicted. 

Sophie stepped back, putting distance between them, her voice calm. ""I brought him here. You two talk. I'm leaving.""

With that, she turned and walked away. 

Behind her, Lily's choked voice called out. ""Danny, is she here to take you away? Please don't go...""

Daniel's tone carried a hint of helplessness as he soothed her. ""Don't overthink it. I'm not going anywhere.""


Chapter 4
Sophie had nearly finished packing her suitcase. 

Her phone buzzed on the desk, the name ""Eleanor Carter"" flashing on the screen, making her pause. 

She stared at the name, remembering how Eleanor used to hold her hand, insisting Sophie was the true lady of the Carter family. 

Yet, near Sophie's death, Eleanor complained to Daniel that Sophie was too stubborn, not as charming as Lily. 

""Sophie! Get to the Carter mansion now! Hurry!"" Eleanor's voice came through the phone, frantic. ""Daniel... he's completely out of line!""

Sophie gripped the phone and walked to the window, where the shadows of a sycamore tree swayed below. 

Daniel had brought Lily to the Carter family home, a place he once despised. 

""Got it,"" Sophie replied calmly. 

The Carter mansion's gates stood wide open. The servants' faces showed hesitation as they saw her. 

The living room felt heavy with tension. 

When Eleanor saw Sophie, she rushed forward, grabbing her wrist like a lifeline. ""Sophie, you're finally here!"" Her eyes were red. ""Look at this! Daniel brought that village girl into our home! Don't worry, I only recognize you as my daughter-in-law. She needs to leave now!""

Sophie followed Eleanor's pointing finger. Lily sat stiffly, hands twisting her clothes nervously, shrinking closer to Daniel when she saw Sophie. 

Daniel sat beside Lily, his wrists still marked by faint rope burns from fishing nets. 

He looked thinner than he had in Seaside Village, the innocence of Danny gone from his expression. 

Had his memories started to return? 

Hearing Eleanor's words, Daniel looked up at Sophie, his gaze complex. 

It held guilt, struggle, but none of the confusion he had in the village. 

Sophie understood clearly. The man before her was slowly becoming the Daniel Carter she once knew. 

""Eleanor, please calm down,"" Daniel said, standing. ""This isn't Lily's fault. I brought her here.""

""You're defending her?"" Eleanor snapped. ""You've shamed the Carter family!""

""Father!"" Daniel cut her off, his tone firm. ""About the engagement..."" He turned, his eyes meeting Sophie's. ""Sophie, let's call it off.""

The air froze. 

Eleanor's cries stopped abruptly. 

""Call it off?"" she shouted. ""You're already married! Sophie's name is right there in the family registry with yours. You think you can just walk away from that? Do you take the law for a joke?""

Sophie stood still, a mocking smile tugging at her lips when she heard ""married.""

Eleanor likely still believed the marriage certificate, arranged by Daniel's assistant, was real. 

""The marriage can be undone,"" Sophie said. ""If Mr. Carter cooperates, we can handle the paperwork at city hall.""

Daniel's face darkened, his hand clenching into a fist at his side. 

He knew the marriage certificate was fake. 

His throat bobbed as he looked at Sophie, his expression tangled. 

Lily, sitting on the sofa, went pale. 

She shot to her feet. ""Married? You're already married?""


Chapter 5
Lily looked at Daniel, tears streaming down her face like broken beads, her shoulders trembling violently. ""Danny, tell me this isn't true... You said you'd marry me, that you only loved me...""

Her voice was resolute. ""I may come from a poor fishing village with little education, but I know right from wrong! I'd never be a homewrecker!""

She covered her face and sobbed, heartbroken. 

Daniel watched her cry, her face like a rain-soaked flower, and his heart softened. 

He reached out to comfort her, but she shoved his hand away. 

""Don't touch me!"" Lily cried harder. ""You're married now. We... we can't be like we were before... I'm going back to the village and won't bother you anymore...""

She turned toward the door, her steps unsteady, as if she might collapse. 

""Lily!"" Daniel chased after her, grabbing her wrist, his voice urgent. ""Listen to me, it's not what you think...""

""What is it then?"" she demanded. ""Is the marriage certificate fake? Don't lie to me, Daniel!""

Daniel fell silent, his face flushing and paling. 

""Mr. Carter,"" Sophie interrupted their struggle, ""since Miss Harvey cares so much about legitimacy, why don't we go to city hall now and sort it out? Let her see if we're really married.""

Daniel's expression grew darker. ""What? Afraid to go?"" Sophie raised an eyebrow. ""Or is that marriage certificate fake?""

Eleanor's eyes widened. 

Always sharp, she grasped the situation instantly. 

She stared at Daniel in disbelief. ""Daniel...""

Daniel's lips moved, but he lowered his head, silently admitting the truth. 

Eleanor trembled with rage, unable to speak, and suddenly collapsed. 

""Eleanor!"" Daniel shouted, rushing to catch her. 

The living room erupted into chaos. 

Days later, the doorbell rang urgently when Sophie was organizing documents for her move abroad. 

Daniel stood outside, his hair disheveled, a shadow of his former confident self. 

When Sophie opened the door, the sharp smell of disinfectant hit her. 

He opened his mouth, his voice hoarse. ""Sophie, the doctor says Eleanor's not doing well.""

Sophie remained silent. 

""She keeps asking for you,"" Daniel said, his eyes pleading. ""Could you... could you visit her at the hospital? For the sake of... our past.""

Sophie looked at him, her gaze settling on the faint scar between his brows. 

It came from their childhood, when they climbed trees in the yard, and Daniel got scratched protecting her. 

Back then, he pressed the sweetest candy into her hand. 

When bullies targeted her, he'd stand in front, saying, ""Sophie, when I grow up, I'll marry you.""

Those childhood memories flashed through her mind. 

Back then, Daniel's eyes held only her, his love pure and fierce. 

But his sudden amnesia changed everything. 

Sophie sighed. 

In Seaside Village, he gave all his tenderness to Lily Harvey. 


Chapter 6
In her past life, Daniel enjoyed the sacrifices of Sophie and the Wilson family while secretly cherishing another woman. After Sophie's death, he ruthlessly took over Wilson Enterprises, leaving her family in ruin. 

""Past?"" Sophie softly echoed the word, her tone wistful. ""Daniel, is there anything left between us?""

Daniel's face paled. He stepped forward, pleading. ""I know I failed you, Sophie. But Eleanor... she genuinely cares for you, treats you like her own daughter. She's lying in a hospital bed now, calling your name...""

He lowered his head, his voice faint. ""I know this is all my fault. But I can't betray Lily. I promised to take responsibility for her.""

Pain and conflict filled Daniel's eyes. ""I... I'll make it up to the Wilson family, I swear...""

""No need,"" Sophie cut him off. ""In my heart, we're already done. From now on, you're you, I'm me. The Carter family is the Carter family, and the Wilson family is the Wilson family. We have nothing to do with each other. Don't come looking for me again.""

She moved to close the door, but Daniel pressed his hand against it, urgency in his voice. ""But Eleanor only sees you as her daughter-in-law! If she learns we're really over, her condition will worsen!""

""That's a Carter family matter,"" Sophie said. ""It has nothing to do with me.""

""Sophie!"" Daniel's voice carried desperation. He looked at her resolve and continued. ""I know you hate me, and I know the Wilson family suffered because of us. I'm willing to transfer 5% of Carter Enterprises' shares to the Wilson family, as long as you visit Eleanor in the hospital to ease her mind.""

Five percent of Carter Enterprises. 

Sophie's heart stirred slightly. 

That wasn't a small sum--it could elevate Wilson Enterprises to new heights. 

In her past life, her father's health deteriorated under the relentless pressure from Carter Enterprises, leading to his death. 

In this life, she wouldn't let history repeat itself. 

She looked at Daniel, a mix of emotions swirling within her--hatred, resentment. 

But she knew now wasn't the time for emotions to cloud her judgment. 

For the Wilson family, this deal was worth making. 

""Fine,"" Sophie said, nodding calmly. ""I'll go with you to visit Eleanor in the hospital. But remember, this is just a transaction. Once the shares are transferred to the Wilson family, we're done.""

A flicker of complex emotions crossed Daniel's eyes, along with a hint of loss. 

He nodded. ""Thank you, Sophie.""

Sophie said nothing more. 


Chapter 7
Sophie arrived at the hospital. 

Daniel walked ahead, his steps hurried, while Sophie trailed behind. 

The moment they pushed open the ward door, Eleanor's displeased sigh filled the air. ""We Carters don't welcome you. Can you stop coming here?""

Sophie looked up and saw Eleanor propped up on the hospital bed, her face flushed, ch**t heaving. 

The heart monitor on the bedside table beeped erratically with her agitation. 

Lily stood there, holding a white porcelain bowl filled with soup. 

At Eleanor's harsh words, Lily's shoulders trembled, and her eyes reddened instantly. ""Ma'am, I... I just wanted to bring you some soup. You're not well, you need to eat something..."" Her voice carried a note of grievance. 

""Who wants your food?"" Eleanor snapped, swiping at the bowl in Lily's hands. The sudden movement tugged at her IV line, causing her to wince in pain. 

""Mom, don't get upset!"" Daniel rushed forward, steadying her shoulders, his voice full of concern. ""The doctor said you can't get worked up. Please calm down.""

Seeing this, Lily quickly set the bowl on the bedside table and reached to help Eleanor, but Eleanor recoiled, shoving her away. ""Don't touch me!""

Lily stumbled back, tears streaming down her face. She looked at Daniel, her eyes brimming with helplessness and pity. ""Danny, did I... did I do something wrong? I just wanted to be kind to her...""

Daniel watched her cry, his heart softening with pity. He opened his mouth to comfort her but caught sight of Sophie at the door. The words died in his throat, and his face showed awkward hesitation. 

Sophie stood still, coldly observing the scene. 

Her gaze fell on the bowl of soup on the bedside table. It was thin, with just a few grains of rice floating on top, bland and unappetizing. 

Lily hadn't even bothered to learn Eleanor's preferences. 

""Eleanor,"" Sophie said, her voice calm. 

Eleanor's anger softened slightly at the sight of Sophie, replaced by a look of grievance. ""Sophie, you're here at last! Look at this woman, stirring up chaos in our family, and now she's come to the hospital to upset me!""

At the sound of Sophie's voice, Lily stiffened, her sobs growing louder, as if Sophie were some terrifying beast. 

Sophie ignored Lily and walked to the bedside, her eyes on Eleanor. ""Eleanor, I came to check on you. The doctor says you need rest and shouldn't get upset.""

Eleanor grabbed Sophie's hand, as if finding her anchor. ""You're the sensible one, Sophie! Not like some people who only know how to make me angry! Tell me, has Daniel been bewitched by this woman? Why would he choose her over a fine girl like you? Don't worry, I'll never let that woman into our family. You're the only daughter-in-law the Carters recognize!""


Chapter 8
Sophie gently pulled her hand back, her tone neutral. ""Eleanor, matters of the heart should be left to fate.""

Her gaze paused, sweeping over the tense trio in the room before settling back on Eleanor's face. ""Focus on your recovery. We can talk about the rest when you're better.""

Eleanor knew Sophie was deflecting. Though she wasn't thrilled that Sophie's family outranked the Carters, fearing her son would be overshadowed, she genuinely despised Lily. 

As a woman, Eleanor saw through Lily's facade--far from the kind, harmless girl Daniel described. 

Seeing Sophie's distant expression now, Eleanor felt a pang of unease. This wasn't what she expected. 

The old Sophie always humored her, gentle and considerate, but now those beautiful eyes held only politeness. 

""Sophie..."" Eleanor began. 

""Eleanor, you should eat something,"" Sophie interrupted, pulling an insulated container from her bag. She opened it, revealing a sweet, milky aroma of pear-infused custard, carefully prepared with diced fruit. 

Eleanor's expression softened, thinking Sophie's gesture showed she still cared for the Carters, even if she was upset. 

""You're always so thoughtful,"" Eleanor said, taking the bowl from Sophie and sipping a spoonful slowly. ""Daniel's becoming more reckless by the day.""

Daniel stood nearby, his face clouded. 

Though his memories were hazy, the scene felt familiar. 

Fragments of memory told him his mother truly favored Sophie. 

He glanced at Lily, conflicted. 

Lily's tears still fell. She watched Eleanor eat Sophie's custard with approval while her own soup sat ignored on the table, like a mockery. 

Biting her lip, she suddenly crouched, clutching her stomach with a pained gr**n. ""My stomach hurts so much.""

Her gasping broke the room's brief calm. 

Daniel's attention snapped to her, concern overtaking him. ""What's wrong? Where does it hurt?""

Lily looked up, wincing. ""I don't know... Maybe I didn't eat this morning...""

Eleanor's face darkened. 

Sophie smirked inwardly. 

""If she's unwell, take her to a doctor,"" Sophie said coolly. ""I'll stay here. Take Miss Harvey for a check-up.""

Daniel hesitated. His mother was still in the hospital bed, but Lily was curled up on the floor, clearly in pain. He couldn't ignore her. 

""Go,"" Eleanor said, unwilling to argue with her son in front of Sophie. ""Don't be an eyesore here.""

Daniel gritted his teeth, helped Lily up, and led her out. 

As Lily leaned into Daniel's arms, her eyes flicked toward Sophie, a glint of triumph in them. 

The moment the door closed, Eleanor set the bowl down and sighed. ""Sophie, you saw it. That woman's cunning. Daniel's completely fooled by her.""

Sophie didn't respond, only picking up a tissue to gently wipe Eleanor's mouth. 

""Rest well,"" she said. ""Daniel has his own life to live.""

Eleanor froze, then understood. 

""Sophie, can't you give Daniel another chance?"" Her voice carried exhaustion. ""Our families have been close for so many years...""


Chapter 9
Eleanor saw Sophie's calm expression and sat up anxiously, the IV needle in her hand pulling painfully, though she ignored it. She grabbed Sophie's hand tightly. ""Sophie, if you stay, if you give Daniel another chance, everything in the Carter family will be yours.""

She caught her breath, her eyes earnest, as if betting everything. ""You're the true lady of the Carter family. Once I'm better, I'll hand over all the keys, the accounts, the servants, the entire estate--everything will be yours to decide. I won't interfere.""

Sophie's hand ached under Eleanor's grip. The words unlocked a flood of memories. 

Scenes from her past life surged forward. 

When Sophie first joined the Carter family, Eleanor had held her hand, smiling, calling her the new lady of the house, only to later instruct the housekeeper to lock away the storeroom keys. 

When Sophie wanted to replace a dishonest maid, Eleanor dismissed it, saying, ""Old help is more reliable.""

Even on Sophie's deathbed, Eleanor complained to Daniel, ""Sophie was too eager to take control, hardly the refined lady.""

Eleanor had clung to power her whole life, treating Sophie like an outsider to guard against. Yet now, to win back her son, she lowered herself so far. 

Sophie looked down at Eleanor's aged hand, swollen from the overnight IV. 

""People choose their own paths,"" Sophie said, her gaze drifting to a sycamore tree outside the window. ""Daniel made his choice, and he'll face the consequences. As for love...""

She paused. ""Who can predict the future? Let fate decide.""

Eleanor studied Sophie's profile, the sunlight softening her beautiful face, yet making her seem distant. 

Eleanor opened her mouth, but her prepared pleas and promises stuck in her throat. 

For the first time, she realized this girl, whom she'd watched grow up, was slipping from the Carters' grasp. 

After Eleanor fell asleep, Sophie tucked the blanket around her and quietly closed the door. 

As she left the hospital building, she spotted Lily Harvey standing under a tree's shade. 

Lily looked like she'd been waiting for a while, her face streaked with dried tears. Seeing Sophie, she hurried forward. 

""Miss Wilson,"" Lily said timidly, ""can we... can we talk privately? I have something to say.""

Sophie looked at her silently, nodding in agreement. 

They reached the rooftop. 

High-rise buildings loomed in the distance, the hospital's red roof nearby, the air thick with disinfectant and sunlight. 

Sophie felt an unexplained irritation. 

""Miss Wilson,"" Lily began, tears falling again, ""I know you look down on me, think I'm just a village girl, unworthy of Daniel. But I... I truly love him.""

Her eyes glistened. ""I grew up with my grandmother on a fishing boat, enduring hardships you can't imagine. I never had the nice clothes other girls wore. It was Daniel who made me feel wanted, like I wasn't invisible.""

She dropped to her knees with a thud. ""Miss Wilson, you have a good family, beauty, talent--you deserve someone better. But Daniel's all I have. Please, let us be. Leave him, leave this city. I promise I'll take care of him, look after Eleanor, and never cause you trouble...""

Sophie stood still, watching her. 

She observed Lily's tearful performance. 

Lily spoke at length, but Sophie's calm, unmoved gaze made her feel like a fool. 

Her face darkened, her eyes dry, unable to summon more tears. 

""What do you want?"" Lily's voice sharpened. ""I've said all this, and you're not moved at all? Are you determined to drive us to ruin?""

Sophie finally lifted her eyes, her tone flat. ""Are you done?""

Those words pierced Lily's fragile pride. 

She shot to her feet, glaring at Sophie's serene demeanor, her anger erupting. 

A sharp slap echoed across the rooftop.

1mxlmlw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxlmlw,"Built a Stock Screener Where the ""Cream Rises to the Top"" - Quality Companies Literally Float Up [OC]","Been working on different approaches to make stock screening more effortless and intuitive. After trying various things, landed on something unique - a stock screener where high-quality companies literally rise to the top in real-time as you adjust criteria. The effect mirrors how real markets work, but you can watch it happen.

**The ""cream rises"" effect**

Companies start scattered, but as you tighten quality filters, the best performers naturally float upward while weaker companies sink. Set a minimum profitability threshold and watch profitable companies bubble up. Add debt constraints and see overleveraged firms sink. Combine multiple criteria and only the true quality companies rise to the top.

**What makes this unique**

Most financial visualizations are static snapshots. This shows the filtering process as fluid animation - you're watching the market separate wheat from chaff as standards get more demanding.

Bubble physics creates natural clustering. Companies with similar metrics group together as they rise or fall, creating visual quality layers. Market cap determines bubble size, so you can see if big companies are rising or if smaller gems are floating up.

The screener offers two modes: a simple quality-based approach using business health pillars, and an advanced mode with 40+ financial ratios.

Also, there is a table view, which allows you to see more information about each ticker (sector, price, 52-week range, etc), and you can click a link to get detailed research info about the company. 

**The satisfying part**

There's something mesmerizing about watching hundreds of companies sort themselves in real-time. Crank up quality requirements and watch mediocre performers get filtered out while survivors cluster at the top. It's like premium coffee sorting - adjust criteria and watch specialty-grade companies separate from commodity stocks.

Background color bands shift from red (poor) to green (excellent), so quality companies literally float in the green zone.

**Technical magic**

This required serious D3 force simulation tweaking. Bubbles respond to both metric values AND filtering animations simultaneously. The challenge was making 100+ animated bubbles perform smoothly with real-time data updates.

**Why this works**

Traditional scatter plots show where companies are. This shows how they move when market standards change - the difference between a photograph and a movie of market dynamics.

The rising cream metaphor mirrors real markets. Quality companies do rise over time, while poor performers get filtered out by demanding criteria.

**Feedback welcome**

This is part of a broader financial platform, currently in beta and looking for input on what works vs what just looks cool. Does watching companies physically rise and fall help with analysis, or would you rather see final filtered results?

1mxll51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxll51,The Resort at Paws Up Review," **Overall impression**

Paws Up is a beautiful idea in a beautiful place. It aims to be the luxury answer to the family ranch fantasy: big-sky Montana, serious food, a marquee spa, and enough activities to keep everyone busy from breakfast to s'mores. When it works, it feels like a bougie adult summer camp with great kids programming. When it stalls, you're reminded that delivering five-star consistency across 37,000 acres is no simple task. We experienced both.

The recurring theme throughout our stay was leadership visibility - or rather, the complete lack of it. On the ground, this is a sprawling activity ranch with (in my opinion) serious operational problems. Leadership is invisible, housekeeping and quality control are inconsistent, communication is unreliable, and risk management needs significant work. I don't enjoy writing these things, but as a travel advisor, I would not place clients here or recommend a visit until there's a management reset and documented improvement in standards.

**Why we went, and what I expected**

Before I was a travel advisor, I spent a long career in wine. Winemakers I worked with hosted events at Paws Up and raved about it, and a charity board I sit on auctioned a stay here that sold for a small fortune. I had heard about the place for years and promised myself we would go when the kids were old enough. We finally did. Fun fact: the stay went sideways so badly that it pushed me into this career. After our trip, I debriefed with the advisor (who did not book this trip for us) who would become my mentor, u/sarahwlee, and it hammered home a hard truth: plenty of advisors do not travel, are not plugged into a strong host network, and will still recommend glossy properties like this. A great advisor travels, has real relationships, knows what luxury is, and tells you the truth. That kind of advisor changes outcomes. Sharing these reviews here is my way of cutting through the noise, and a reminder that there is real value in using an advisor beyond the perks. The good ones know what is up.

**Ownership and scale**

Plenty of great hotels are owned by people who don’t have hospitality backgrounds. Strong operators can learn the business, or hire great people to do it for them (Four Seasons has basically become a farm team for this). That said, success in franchised hair care does not automatically translate to high-touch hospitality on a remote ranch.

The resort was founded by David E. Lipson, who made his money as a Chicago merchant banker and as the major investor-executive behind Supercuts. He led the buyout in 1987, took it public in 1991, and served as chairman and CEO. Court records later show he was found liable in a civil insider-trading case tied to 1995 stock sales, resulting in a permanent injunction and roughly $2.8 million in penalties. The family bought the ranch in 1997 and opened Paws Up in 2005.

The insider trading conviction wasn't an isolated incident. Locals in Missoula have long complained about the resort's treatment of workers - low wages, poor management, high turnover. A quick search on r/missoula will give some insight into that. When ownership approaches business with that mindset, it trickles down to guest experience too.

Running lodging, dining, activities, horses, and seasonal labor across nearly 40,000 acres requires different skills than scaling retail franchises. On our dates, both the operational gaps and cultural issues showed.

**Location and setting**

Greenough, Montana. Roughly 35 to 45 minutes from Missoula International Airport. Meet and greet at MSO is available. Many homes include a Lexus for on-ranch use. The estate covers 10,000 private acres plus a 27,000 acre BLM lease, with the Blackfoot River and roughly 100 miles of trails as a backdrop. Remote yet accessible. Quiet, stunning, and exactly what Big Sky country promises.

**Brand and property ecosystem**

The ranch was reimagined for hospitality in the late 1990s and opened in 2005. Over time it became two experiences on one estate. Paws Up is the family-friendly, activity-heavy side. The green o next door is a 12 key adults-only enclave of high-design “hauses” with a chef’s-counter program at Social Haus.

**Accommodations**

Paws Up sells two modes: stand-alone homes and seasonal glamping camps.

There are 64 accommodations at Paws Up, including 28 private homes and 36 safari-style tents across six camps. The green o adds 12 hauses on the same estate.

**Homes:** These have big footprints, proper kitchens, and plenty of bedrooms. The overall design and style are good, but our cabin had preventable quality-control misses. Items from prior guests were left behind - my son found some other kid's Baby Yoda blanket and still cherishes it (sorry to whoever lost it), but that's not how you want to discover a room. Kitchen basics were missing, the coffee maker still had grounds in the filter, and restocks were inconsistent unless requested. The resort vehicle we were issued was dirty and basically unusable; the replacement wouldn't start. None of this is catastrophic, but all of it's avoidable with a checklist and final walk-through. If you market at the five-star level, housekeeping and quality control need to match.

**Glamping camps.** This is where Paws Up is most consistent. Six camps sit along riverbanks or ridgelines. Tents are climate controlled and set up with king beds, heated bathroom floors, and rain showers. Each camp has a Dining Pavilion, a dedicated chef, and a camp butler. The shared lounges are places you actually want to linger, and the service culture felt tighter here than in the homes.

**Planning tip.** If you book a home, insist on a pre-arrival stocked checklist, a supervisor walk-through before key handoff, and written confirmation that your assigned vehicle has been inspected that day.

**Food and drink**

The culinary teams are talented and the range is broad. Pomp handles refined dinners, Trough covers casual dining, Tank serves as the adjacent bar, and Shed runs seasonal live-fire barbecue with music and views. Chuck Wagon dinners deliver the riverside campfire fantasy, while at the green o, Social Haus provides the tasting-menu theater. Menus are flexible for families and the kids' options are strong.

Service pacing needs serious polish, though. Refills lagged, plates from earlier courses were slow to clear (which left tables cluttered), and the food deserved much better choreography. We also ran into seat scarcity at peak times - there were evenings when there was simply nowhere to sit. If you won't take reservations, you need a real plan to seat your guests.

**Spa and wellness**

Spa Town is a signature feature. Treatment tents sit at the edge of a meadow. There is a full menu of massage and facials, yoga and sound sessions, plus a refreshed fitness center. My massage was good and I liked that it was in a tent where I could hear the birds chirping and the creek running while receiving my service. It is not a destination spa in the city-hotel sense, but for a ranch property the setup is thoughtful and restorative.

**Activities and kids**

This is the resort's strongest offering, with riding in many forms, fly fishing, water sports, UTV tours, archery, shooting sports, cattle drives, e-bikes, hiking, and specialized winter programming. The Kids Corps of Discovery my kids loved – it was engaging and confidence-building, and most guides are seasonal college or grad students who bring a cheerful camp-counselor energy to the days. We tried a lot of activities, and the guiding was consistently kind and competent.

One incident is worth noting because it speaks to training and oversight issues. Another guest, an adult with Down syndrome, was assigned a very slow, older horse for a trail ride, but partway through, the horse rolled and she came off. She was ultimately fine, but it was frightening and suggested a need for stricter rider-horse matching, medical screening of animals, and clearer protocols for guests who may need extra support. Accidents happen with horses, but risk management matters and once again this just felt like there was very little in the way of management or anyone running the show.

**Service, leadership, and operations**

This is where the luxury proposition completely wobbled. Messages to the hotel often sat without replies for days, scheduling was perpetually confused, and activities we never participated in appeared on our bill. A mid-stay email to management went unanswered until a front-desk advocate helped escalate it, and a follow-up note directly to the GM received no response at all. The text-based concierge thread stopped replying to me after two days and inexplicably shifted all communication to my husband, who then had to chase down corrections to consistently wrong or missing information. Room service became a minefield when we were provided an outdated menu by the concierge, then scolded by restaurant staff for trying to order from it. Throughout our stay, the kitchen consistently outpaced the floor service, creating a disjointed dining experience.

The larger issue was a complete absence of leadership visibility. During our entire stay, there was effectively no manager presence anywhere on property. It was nearly impossible to identify who the on-property leader was, let alone find a clear way to contact that person. The website offered no help either. I knew the general manager peripherally from my wine-industry days and reached out directly through multiple channels - radio silence. The front-desk manager on duty was so frustrated by the operational chaos and her inability to get basic decisions made that she told us she was resigning. By our checkout, she had already left.

All of this is fixable with proper process, adequate staffing, and basic accountability. None of it is acceptable at this price point, and the pattern suggests deeper cultural issues that trickle down from ownership philosophy to daily operations.

**Final takeaways**

If your priority is a big-sky backdrop, a deep activity book, and very good food, Paws Up can deliver a memorable trip. If you need hotel-grade consistency, visible leadership, and tight housekeeping, your experience will depend on the day and the team on duty. My advice is to lean into the camps, be precise with pre-arrival requests, and plan to quarterback a few details once you are there.

**Who this resort is for**

* Families who want space, serious activities, and kids programming that actually engages
* Travelers who love glamping, with camp chefs and butlers
* Wellness-minded guests who will use Spa Town between hikes and rides
* Groups that value privacy, acreage, and an easy hop from a commercial airport
* Food-focused travelers who want everything from chef’s counter to chuck wagon on one property

**Who this resort is not for**

* Travelers who expect five-star hotel rigor in housekeeping, communication, and service choreography
* People who expect the marketed promise to match the on-the-ground delivery without reminders
* Minimalists seeking hushed lobbies and clubby quiet
* Guests who prefer guaranteed polish and visible management over rustic energy

**Where I might book instead**

* **The Ranch at Rock Creek, Montana:** true all-inclusive ranch with tighter operations and stronger safety culture
* **Triple Creek Ranch, Montana:** adults-only, consistent service, smaller and well run
* **Brush Creek Ranch, Wyoming:** big activity book with better scaffolding behind it
* **One&Only Big Sky, Montana:** hotel-level mechanics, lift access, and strong family infrastructure
* **Dunton Hot Springs, Colorado:** smaller scale, character, and attentive service

Overpriced chain-hotel vibes, bad food in cardboard boxes, and service that feels more Motel 6 than “luxury Big Sur.”","tl;dr: Don’t waste your points (or cash) on Alila Ventana. Overpriced chain-hotel vibes, bad food in cardboard boxes, and service that feels more Motel 6 than “luxury Big Sur.”  
  
We stayed there once before it turned into an Alila property and at the time it was wonderful. Not super luxurious but very chill and discrete. 

We booked it with Hyatt points that have been sitting in my account forever and thought it's a good weekend escape. In theory the cheapest room during that weekend was 2800 USD/night and I'd have been furious had I payed this amount of money for it.  
  
**Room:**  
We received an upgrade to a fireplace room.   
The room looked dated and had the charm of an average chain hotel. The shower was in a bathtub with a very ugly curtain to close it.   
No water in the room but two empty refillable bottles. The next water station was 50 yards away and of course I was thirsty in the evening and then had to walk around the property and search for that water station in the dark.   
It's great to be sustainable but why not fill those bottles for someone paying 2800 dollars a night? And why do you provide 740ml (no joke) bottles with a machine that only has a 750ml option? It's a tiny thing but you then walk around with a dripping bottle unless you bring a small towel. 

Our room lock started acting up at night and made a buzzing noise and had its LEDs flashing in all colors. My wife woke up a couple of times during the first night and didn't know what it was. The second night it got worse and kept buzzing so loudly that we couldn't sleep. We called the reception and they said they could only provide ear plugs because there is no technician at night.   
After a few more hours (maybe 2am?) we asked for a different room and slept there. 

**Food:**  
It's all inclusive but very mediocre and really badly trained waiters.  Besides our one-off noise problem this was the biggest letdown of this property.   
The main restaurant serves brunch and dinner and the menu is super limited.   
Food is mediocre to bad (for example overcooked risotto with ""lobster tail"". The tail arrived shredded as an add-on for 30?ish dollars and was bland).   
Presentation is worse than an average bib gourmand restaurant. 

There is no lunch on property except for sandwiches at the pool and room service which has sandwiches/salads and a grain bowl with an optional protein add-on.  
If I want to pay for real food I can't. At a 2800 dollar/night property. No steak, no fish of the day, nothing.   
Worse, the food arrives in cardboard boxes.   
Try cutting a dry piece of chicken in a cardboard box.   
Fruit and vegetables don't taste good. This is really hard to achieve in California. 

**Waiters:** They kept touching our plates. Instead of carrying them without touching the surface we'll eat from they held the plate with their fingers on the surface. Even a coffee was held by the rim with a finger. I've never ever seen this anywhere and here this happened with two waiters.   
I worked as a waiter for a few events during college. It's one of the first things in the briefing and I never held a plate like that. 

**Pool:** Lots of instagrammers here now. I don't mind as long as I'm not on their videos.   
Service was super super slow.   
When we arrived the neighboring chairs had food on them. Nobody came to clean up except for lots of birds which had a feast. They seemed to be used to eating the leftovers that aren't cleaned up.   
When I walked to the bar area to tell them to clean up it took a long time for them to actually do that. 

Coffee arrived in a to-go cup. I asked why and they again talked about sustainability.   
I'm not sure what's sustainable about transporting tons of cardboards to Big Sur and then transporting it away after a single use. 

**Pre-Check-In:**

In the booking emails they provide contact details  which includes ""ventanafrontdesk@ventanabigsur.com"". That email however isn't monitored.   
After not hearing back for a few days I had to call them to then get the concierge email.   
That took long enough that there weren't any early dinner reservations left when I eventually talked to hotel staff.   
It turned out not to be an issue to simply show up and eat but 1) they didn't tell us that we could do that 2) it creates temporary frustration with the service of the property.  
I generally understand that not all hotels guarantee tables for dinner but if they don't they should monitor emails from guests who ask if they need any reservations.

**Checkout:** They asked if I enjoyed my stay. I said ""No"" and without any emotional reaction they said ""ah yes you had an issue with your room, we removed the 40 dollars incidental charges from your bill"".  
No further questions how they can make it right or at least words of empathy for starting the day tired instead of rested.

**Post-Checkout:**  
I forgot two clothing items on a hanger. They said they'd send it to me via mail and asked for delivery address etc. 10 days later I called inquiring about the status and of course they hadn't even sent it yet.   
  
Corporate HQ probably optimized the last dollar that still keeps the property full with points bookings and once-in-a-lifetime California road trips of international travelers.   
Cheap ingredients, limited options, lazy preparation, unmotivated service. 

It's sad because the area is so beautiful.   
It's the first time that I regret a points booking. It wasn't worth our time. Usually it's just ""well it's not that great but at least it's free"".

The environment is clean, thoughtfully designed (**many** **locations feel like a 4-star hotel lobby)**, and **filled with people who are respectful and professional.**

* **Complimentary perks:** Unlimited coffee, tea, and soft drinks all day. Fresh light breakfast (Ex: pastries/ fruit/quiche/ charcuterie) at 9 AM and snacks at 2 PM daily.
* **Weekly happy hours** on Thursdays.
* **Clean, quiet spaces:** Plenty of private phone booths for calls or meetings.
* **Travel-friendly:** Access to global locations (Europe, California, New York, and more) with your membership.

I have **one open co-working membership** available as part of my plan and I’m looking for a **responsible person** to join as my teammate at a **30\~40% discount off retail pricing**.

* Retail price: $430/month + $99 for global access (different cities, countries) = **$530/month**
* I'm not trying to lock you in for 12 months, but hoping to find someone who is looking for few months at least.
* If you go through their membership which is marketed as “month-to-month,” they require a full month’s notice before your next billing cycle. So, you will likely get locked in for a minimum of two months to cancel membership. 

**Your Access details:**

* Monday–Friday, 9 AM–5 PM for entry (you can stay past 5 PM, just no re-entry after doors close).
* Unlimited visits during business hours.
* Full access through the app with your own login.
* Some locations are okay with behaved pets ( but probably not for all day, check when reserving).

I’m a daily espresso drinker, usually at home with my simple Nespresso machine. The restaurant I work at also has an espresso machine, which I love. I typically don’t add anything to my espresso, but will occasionally order an americano or a cappuccino on rare occasions. 

My girlfriend has no issue with the coffee at Starbucks, but will always pick a small, boutique coffee shop over them when available. She prefers the aesthetic and supporting small, locally owned businesses when possible. Especially when we travel together, we start every day at a different local cafe. 

Over the years, I have found the espresso at 99% of these establishments to be undrinkable battery acid. I’ll taste her iced vanilla chai cinnamon dulce cold foam tiramisu latte, and it will usually taste fine, with all the other flavors overpowering the coffee. But this is not what I want for my morning pick me up. 

This always leaves me asking myself, “does everyone who comes to this cafe just cover up the flavor of their coffee with milks and syrups and cold foams until it doesn’t taste like coffee anymore?”
Is it possible that 99% of cafes make terrible espresso? Or do I only like Starbucks/Nespresso/highly manufactured espresso and not the real deal? And if that’s the case, who’s drinking this battery acid?

Can anyone tell me how to fix this Saeco XSmall HD8645 and prevent the brewing unit from popping out everytime you go to brew? The steam wand and hot water function works fine. They will output steam and hot water when the knob is switched over. However, whenever I go to brew coffee or attempt to perform descaling the brewing unit pops out. 

I've checked multiple times that the brewing unit is correctly set and inserted, that's how the machine can still output steam and water. However, the machine's internal gear that turns the brewing unit's inner mechanism is rotating the brewing unit past it's ability to turn so that it forces the whole unit to pop out. You can tell since the brewing unit's gear which matches with the machine's internal gear is being stripped, see annotated photo below. Any help will be appreciated!

Failed solutions:  
\- Turning machine on and off. This will reset the machine's gear so that it will receive the brewing unit's gear. After the brewing unit pops out you can't insert it immediately since the machine's gear is offset and will not match the position of the brewing unit.

I was on a cruise around the UK and we ended up in Edinburgh about two weeks ago, which happened to be while there was a big festival.  Big, like all of August.  google it…
Anyway, I happened an upon a group of scouters getting a coffee and worked up the nerve to say hello. Nicest people ever! 
I had brought some neckerchiefs from my troop with the plan to trade if I ran into scouts, and that day I had forgotten them. I explained this and one of them still handed me her standard one. If anyone recognizes this and can get me in touch with the unit from Sutton I’d love to get a neckerchief and some patches in the mail.",3,1755903931.0,scouting,0,1.0,False

I’m new in Berlin and I’d love to meet some new people, especially female friends, to hang out with. I enjoy grabbing a coffee, exploring different parts of the city, going for walks, and sometimes checking out cultural events or live music.

I’m friendly, open-minded and just looking to build some good connections here. If anyone would like to meet up casually for coffee, a drink, or just explore Berlin together, feel free to DM me 🙂",0,1755903490.0,berlinsocialclub,8,0.29,False

Normally I push through when taking a test or take a rizatriptan the night before a big test to prevent migraines. This usually works well enough to offset the occasional test I do poorly on due to migraines, but my episodes increased in frequency this summer despite to 2-3x per week and I’m worried about this upcoming semester. Does anyone have any tips on how to balance college and migraines? (My sleep schedule is relatively regular, I drink tons of water, and have one cup of coffee at the same time every day.

1mxl4uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1mxl4uw/whats_up_with_some_women_demanding_dinner_as_a/,What's up with some women demanding dinner as a first date?,"I've noticed a social media trend (mainly on TikTok and IG) of women coming online to talk about how anything less than dinner is unacceptable as a first date, and that the man should foot the bill for it. Is this just engagement bait, or are people really like this?

Personally, I find dinner as a first date awkward as hell. Because 1) I feel a little self-conscious about eating in front of a complete stranger, and 2) this goes especially for a man I actually like. I have been on three such dates. No I did not suggest it, I gave it a shot and just don't like it. (Two of the men even attempted to order for me, like what the hell? Lol.)

If you end up not clicking with the person it's extremely awkward and you still have to get through the duration of the meal, it's painful lol. Even worse if you end up not liking the food, then you feel like a jerk for not liking the food at the restaurant he picked, and is paying for. This has just been my personal experience (I'm 31 and female for reference). I honestly prefer coffee or bar dates because it's low-stakes, low-pressure, and you can focus on getting to know the person. The only way dinner as a first date would make sense to me is if you know the person IRL and they asked you out. Otherwise, dinner as a first date with a stranger from a dating app is just too damn awkward.

It’s bewildering to me that women who look well put-together and successful would go through such lengths for a free meal. So is it about the free meal, or just feeling like you're not living up to your ""self-worth"" if it's not a dinner date? I'm not judging people's dating preferences, I'm just curious and don't get it... So ladies who prefer this, what's the story? (I'm talking about the US specifically, but folks from other countries are welcome to chime in!)",0,1755903345.0,TooAfraidToAsk,9,0.5,False
