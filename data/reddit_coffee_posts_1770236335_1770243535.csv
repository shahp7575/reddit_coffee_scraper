I enjoy going to clothing stores, sketching, visiting art galleries, or just talking about creative ideas in general.

Just hoping to meet a few like-minded people to hang out or chat with. Open to grabbing coffee, drawing together, or checking out art/fashion-related stuff around campus or Hamilton, or Toronto.

1qw2ttm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw2ttm,"Hi there everybody, my name is Joe Fox and I'm an Aurora based Video Producer and Photographer currently seeking new clients for 2026","Hi everyone! My name is Joe and I am a Photographer and Video Producer based out of NW Aurora, Colorado, and I'm currently seeking new assignments to fill the remainder of 2026.

My work experience includes a bit of everything, including the production of promotional materials, event coverage, non-profit work, portraits, weddings, film premieres, documentaries, narrative films…

You may have actually seen some of my work if you've watched ""America's Hidden Gem: Northwest Aurora"" ([now streaming on Rocky Mountain PBS!](https://www.rmpbs.org/shows/americas-hidden-gem-northwest-aurora)), which I served on as Assistant Director, Associate Producer, Videographer, and Production Coordinator, or if you've seen any of the [PSA's from last election season promoting measures A and B for the implementation of a Downtown Development Authority in Northwest Aurora](https://youtu.be/Dvh2gaaGjlQ?si=LbtnqXpt9ZDs3PCW) \- all videos which I shot and edited 95% of.

I’ve enclosed a few images within this thread that outline my work, but to get the full scope of my capabilities you may want to check out my website at [www.JoeSkiProductions.com](http://www.joeskiproductions.com/), where you’ll find various samples of my prior work as well as my 2026 Photo + Video Production Pricing guide.

My photography work can best be described as “Documentary Style” albeit with more vibrant color grading and with *\*some\** posing thrown in for good measure.  Ultimately, I prefer giving subjects prompts over poses and I LOVE capturing emotional candid moments.

My video work is largely steeped in mini-documentary formats. As someone who possesses a very strong moral compass, I love to elevate organizations which are doing incredible work in my community with media that is visually engaging, vibrant, and well paced. I possess over 10 years of nuts-to-bolts media production experience and there’s not a lot I can’t do!

Having said all that, I am also seeking more opportunities to produce work that is a bit more creative, outlandish, maximalist, and narrative-based for brands and companies as well. If you think you might be interested in a consultation, just hit me up!  

Hmmm…and what else.  Well, I enjoy hiking, coffee, baking, cheesy cult films, playing videogames with my wife, and weird performance art.

So that’s me in a nutshell!  If anyone is seeking the services of a Video Producer and/or Photographer in the Denver area I’d love to hear from you!  I hope we can chat soon!",1,1770243299.0,DenverSmallBusinesses,0,1.0,False

1qw2slk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1qw2slk/wp_i_got_like_10_different_prompts_and_want_to/,"[WP] I got like 10 different prompts, and want to whittle down to less options, some of these are scraps, just let me know if any seem worth pursing.","Blood-soaked memories haunt this town like a cancer. The massacre above the Hatfield Diner remains unsolved—the killer's identity known only to the butcher himself and Becky Linder, that poor girl found trembling and catatonic, buried alive between sweat-dampened guest towels on the laundry room floor, her eyes fixed open but seeing nothing.

When I first stepped foot in that cursed place—a decade after the slaughter, before they installed that grotesque stained-glass Jesus with his accusatory gaze and the damning ""WE ARE...

\---

The day the frogs broke their centuries-long truce with the crows was the day the town's clocktower split down the middle, bronzed gears squealing like slaughtered pigs—though perhaps it was the crows who broke the truce, or perhaps there never was a truce at all, just a mutual tolerance born of necessity rather than respect. Certain citizens swore they saw frogs in capelets loitering among the rubble, their eyes blazing with unspoken grievances, while others insisted they'd seen crow feathers, black as judgment, scattered like accusations.

The clocktower—beloved eyesore, hated landmark—was the town's only skyscraper, perched at the top of Lollardy Hill, one of those blighted yet somehow cherished 19th-century souvenirs left behind by the mining boom that both enriched and poisoned the valley. It had a face that glowered over cobblestone streets and bad sidewalk poetry that everyone pretended to despise but secretly read. Most days it ticked in a slow-motion traipse toward midnight, as though time was something the town could afford to waste, though no one could agree whether this was charming or infuriating. On Mondays after the incident, workmen went up with scaffolding, plywood, and buckets of epoxy; by Wednesday, shards of clockface and twisted pendulum clogged the gutter and tinkled underfoot.

Jasper Libretto—who had an allergy to rain

The body washed up on the banks of the Carmel River at 5:47 a.m., according to Jenna Beale's watch. She'd been up since four, walking off another argument with her husband.

""Second corpse this year,"" muttered Old Pete, who'd been fishing downstream when the bloated mass snagged on a fallen oak.

Jenna pushed her sunglasses higher as the mist rose off the body. Driftwood and crushed beer cans framed it like some macabre art installation. The stench hit her in waves.

Seagulls shrieked overhead, diving whenever the current shifted the body.

At Twin Pines Diner, coffee cups clinked against saucers. ""...face down in the mud,"" whispered Marge to the Tuesday breakfast crowd.

Outside, Sheriff McKee leaned against his cruiser, steam rising from his mug as he stared at the river. Jenna folded her newspaper, drained her Coke, and pushed back her chair.and informal historian, surveyed the scene from behind sunglasses so dark the sunrise became a rumor. Seagulls circled, keened, dropped in shrieking sorties every time the breeze rolled the body over.

By eight, the body—male, large, thirty-something—was the subject of three-quarters of the conversations at the Twin Pines Diner. Sheriff McKee lingered outside, sipping his coffee with the philosophical air of a man waiting for the universe to present him with a clue. He waited long enough that Jenna, who’d finished her soda and her crossword, finally got up

\---

Coughing up phlegm the color of rusted copper, you wake with a sore neck against the crumbling tunnel entrance, a once-ornate brass door now caved inward like a crushed insect carapace, hairline fractures of faint amber light bleeding through. Before you, the stone bridge, its mortar cracked and weeping, leads toward woods choked with skeletal undergrowth, the lone burnt tree looming solemnly above like a sentinel of some forgotten apocalypse. A water-stained handbill flutters against ash-streaked bark, its torn edges dancing in the sulfurous breeze:

In a tumbling sea of obsidian glass... Up in the galaxy's gaping maw... Midnight ink bleeds wet mercurial clouds across parchment skies There was the Door to which I found no Key, its lock filled with sand... There was the Veil through which I might not See, woven from the hair of drowned maidens...

Beyond, the path stretches into the Luna Negra woods, where shadows move independent of their owners. The Labyrinth of the Stars with its walls of compressed time. The Castle of Pillars built from the bones of extinct creatures. What are you doing here in this place where reality frays? What is this story, anyway, this fever dream of collective memory?

He blinked the cinder out of his lashes, each flake a tiny meteorite of pain. The world had crazed, just a tick off from the version he'd closed his eyes to, like a familiar painting tilted three degrees. The air, now clotted with something sugary above the carbon, thick as boiled jam left to congeal in forgotten pantries. Each labored breath was a decision…

\---

he watched the neighbor's cat unlatch the window screen with a wet snick, all muddy paw and calculated precision, and thought: some creatures know things they shouldn't. The cat had no collar, but an air of surveillance, like it reported to someone who monitored her failures through those unblinking yellow eyes. Its fur…

\---

Beneath neon lights bleeding data-ghosts into the smog, the Sugar Cube lounge cycled through another Friday.exe. Humans and post-humans slumped against polymer surfaces, neural jacks glinting as they mainlined cheap AR fantasies. The sign above glitched between characters—sometimes Kanji, sometimes Cyrillic—advertising synthdrugs at black market prices; below, Ghostflower Industries' quantum servers hummed, processing terabytes of pain into marketable chemical code.

Buzz ""Punchy"" Boom's outdated wetware struggled to render the room correctly. His jaw—a budget chrome-titanium replacement—leaked hydraulic fluid that caught the light like digital wine. He'd bypassed the bar's facial recognition. He tracked the electromagnetic signature of someone running military-grade adrenal mods and bootlegged hemosynthetic, a walking firewall breach in human form. Bass frequencies synchronized with his heart monitor implant. The clientele—neocortex-modded data jockeys, black-market augmentation addicts, security drones with consciousness hacks—maintained distance. Nobody scanned the glitch in his right arm's haptic feedback loop, or how his voicebox sputtered corrupted audio packets.

\---

Being late always delivered its own kind of ache, which Simon Schmidt felt now as nanobots swarmed the base of his skull, their microscopic mandibles chewing through nerve endings like piranhas. He jammed the elevator's call button, rupturing the implant beneath his thumb—a spray of black-red fluid arced across the steel panel, the viral payload already beginning to corrode the metal.

\---

The silence in the hospital room was the kind that wore a person down, a slow-drip Chinese water torture of ticking clocks and soft wheezes from the machines. James had nothing left to do except count the freckles on the back of his wife's hand while he waited for her to wake, hating himself for the accident he'd caused, yet knowing his presence now was her only anchor. There were thirty-eight freckles, maybe forty if he counted the ones smudged into the hairline, each one a reminder of the sun he'd stolen from her life. From the way she splayed her fingers, he could see the thin blue of her veins arching between the bones like tributaries in a drought-stricken riverbed he'd dammed himself. The memory of her hand—gripping his wrist on the Ferris wheel when they were sixteen—seemed both close enough to touch and buried in some distant, fogged-over time. Even back then, she couldn't bear the height, but had insisted on climbing inside the creaking car, seventeen dollars in coins weighing down her pockets. She'd trusted him to keep her safe then, just as she depended on him now, despite everything he'd done.

\---

She'd always imagined one day she'd be pulled from sleep by something grand and terrible—the old-fashioned clang of disaster.

Instead there was a child , with half her left arm sheathed in a throbbing crust of ointment and gauze, knocking at her door.

The kid was maybe nine, in a sweater with a pattern of curly yellow snakes, one hand knuckling his windpipe. “Do you want tto buy some?” he asked her, holding out a bag of sweets.

The kid grinned: not a mean smile, not quite. “I burned my tongue once and couldn’t taste stuff for like a week.”

His voice echoed through the thin walls. She was the type of woman who wore irritation like war paint, who ate without swallowing, who napped at odd hours and never left the house.",1,1770243230.0,WritingPrompts,1,1.0,False

1qw2npa,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1qw2npa/my_eyes_betrayed_me/,My eyes betrayed me,"I felt like making a standalone submission regarding this scene.

My LO works as a retail pharmacist in a nearby pharmacy that I have been visiting for years. At this point, I think she figured out what's ""going on,"" and I suspect she is interested in me to some extent, though I'm not sure how much. 

A few days ago, I visited the pharmacy. There were no other customers, and only her coworker was at the counter. While she was scanning my items, LO entered the pharmacy from her coffee break, walked behind the counter while holding her coffee mug, and headed towards the back room. I caught her out of the corner of my left eye, then subconsciously focused on her without making any movement other than with my eyes. She is taller than her coworker, and the moment she was behind her, she tilted her head towards me, and we made intense eye contact. Then she tilted her head back, kept walking, and entered the back room.

She gambled that she would catch me staring at her, and she was correct. My eyes betrayed me, and I was caught with my pants down. There was no reason to stare at LO rather than at her coworker, who was scanning my items right in front of me. 

Except that LO is aware of why I was staring at her. 

Something I later figured out during my analysis was that she probably recognized me as soon as she entered the building, even though she could only see my back. Then she circled me like a shark, stole my gaze, and continued to walk as if nothing happened, like in a movie scene.

The best part is that her coworker remained completely clueless about what happened right behind her back. 

My gaze said, ""You are a thousand times more interesting than your younger coworker right in front of me, and all those shiny boxes on the shelf"". Her gaze said, ""Great. Tell me something I don't already know.""

1qw2l9b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw2l9b,How to best utilize breakfast nook area?,"Hi yall, (please forgive the mess 😅-real life question here lol)

Our floor plan has our kitchen/dining area/living space all in one open room- almost as if it were a studio, but we have other rooms down the hall.

I feel pretty good about how we’ve created some separation between the ‘rooms’ so far, but would like some more help or inspiration.

 I have this little breakfast nook (specifically between the piano and our coffee station) and I really want to do two things with this area:

 1. Add some small furniture piece that can serve as our functional “junk table.” Maybe something that is technically storage but has easy quick access. We frequently keep books for my wife daughter and I out, as well as things like keys and mail that clutter the table quickly. I’d like a space for those items to “live” that’s just not our dining table, that might also double as a nice accent piece.

2. I’m not sure how best to style/place our dining table. I like the orientation it is now, but the seats facing the window are hard to access and I don’t really want to turn this wall/window cut out into a breakfast nook with a bench.

1qw2hul,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qw2hul/the_psychology_of_selftrust_how_to_stop_breaking/,The Psychology of Self-Trust: How to Stop Breaking Promises to Yourself (Backed by Research),"You keep setting goals and breaking them. You said you'll be able to start tomorrow, next Monday, after this stressful period ends. But tomorrow never comes. You've disappointed yourself so many times that now, when you make a promise to yourself, there's this voice in the back of your head that just laughs. ""Yeah, sure you will.""

I spent years researching this, podcasts, psychology research, and books from therapists who've worked with thousands of people stuck in this cycle. And here's what I found: self-trust isn't some feel-good concept. It's the foundation of everything. Without it, you're basically living with an enemy inside your own head. But the good news? It can be rebuilt. Not overnight, but with specific, deliberate actions that actually work.

**Step 1: Stop Making Big Promises (Seriously, Stop)**

The first rule of rebuilding self-trust is to stop digging the hole deeper. Every time you make a promise to yourself and break it, you're training your brain that your word means nothing. You're literally teaching yourself that you're unreliable.

So stop making those grand declarations. No more ""I'm going to work out every day,"" ""I'm never eating sugar again,"" or ""I'm going to read 50 books this year."" These promises sound motivating, but they're setting you up to fail.

Instead, make embarrassingly small promises. I'm talking stupidly tiny. Like ""I'll do 5 pushups today,"" or ""I'll read one page,"" or ""I'll drink one glass of water when I wake up."" The goal isn't to transform your life overnight. The goal is to keep one tiny promise to yourself and prove you can do it.

Dr. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford on behavior change backs this up. In his book Tiny Habits, he shows that massive transformations start with actions so small they feel ridiculous. But here's the kicker: when you keep those tiny promises, your brain starts trusting you again. You're rebuilding the neural pathways that say, ""Oh, when I say I'll do something, I actually do it.""

 **Step 2: Track Your Wins Like Your Life Depends on It**

You know what's wild? Your brain has a negativity bias. It remembers every single time you failed but completely ignores the times you succeeded. This is evolutionary biology screwing you over. Our ancestors survived by remembering threats and failures, not wins.

So you need to manually override this. Start a ""kept promises"" journal. Every single day, write down the promises you made to yourself and whether you kept them. Even if it's just ""I said I'd brush my teeth and I did."" Write it down.

I use an app called [Finch ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748)for this. It's a self-care app with a little bird companion, and every time you complete a tiny goal, your bird grows. Sounds silly, but the visual progress is insanely motivating. The app gamifies keeping promises to yourself, and honestly, it works way better than just trying to remember your wins.

The point is: you need evidence. When that voice in your head says, ""you never follow through,"" you can literally point to pages of evidence that says ""actually, I kept 47 promises to myself this month.""

**Step 3: Understand Why You Break Promises**

Here's the uncomfortable truth: you're not breaking promises because you're lazy or weak-willed. There's always a reason. Maybe the promise was too big. Maybe it conflicted with your actual values. Maybe it was something you thought you ""should"" want, not something you actually wanted.

I found this insight in The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest. She talks about how self-sabotage is often self-protection. Your subconscious is trying to protect you from something: fear of failure, fear of success, fear of change, whatever. Until you figure out what you're really afraid of, you'll keep breaking promises.

If you want to go deeper into understanding your patterns and building better habits but don't have the time or energy to read through dozens of books, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that might help. It's an AI-powered personalized learning platform developed by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that pulls insights from psychology books, behavioral research, and expert interviews to create customized audio learning sessions.

You can tell it something specific, like ""I keep breaking promises to myself and I don't know why"" or ""I'm struggling with self-sabotage and need practical strategies,"" and it builds a learning plan tailored to your exact situation. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. The app also has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about your specific struggles, and it recommends content based on its understanding of you. It makes learning about these patterns way more digestible and actually fun.

Spend some time getting real with yourself. When you break a promise, ask: What was I protecting myself from? Was the gym routine too hard, and I was scared I'd fail? Was the business idea scary because success would mean more responsibility? Was the relationship boundary hard to maintain because I'm terrified of being alone?

Understanding the why doesn't immediately fix things, but it stops you from just beating yourself up and actually addresses the root cause.

**Step 4: Create Immediate Consequences and Rewards**

Your brain is wired for immediate feedback. Long-term benefits mean nothing to the part of your brain that wants Netflix and pizza right now. So you need to create immediate consequences for breaking promises and immediate rewards for keeping them.

Try this: get an accountability partner and tell them your tiny daily promise. If you don't do it, you have to Venmo them $10. Sounds harsh, but loss aversion is a powerful motivator. Your brain hates losing money way more than it loves gaining something.

Or use an app like [Stickk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stickk-goals-accountability/id776128765), where you literally put money on the line. You set a goal, put up cash, and if you don't follow through, that money goes to a charity you hate. The psychological pain of your money going to a cause you despise is insanely effective.

For rewards, make them immediate and tangible. Kept your promise to work out for 10 minutes? Great, now you get to watch that episode you've been wanting to see. Finished the task you've been avoiding? Awesome, treat yourself to that fancy coffee. Train your brain that keeping promises feels good immediately.

**Step 5: Separate Identity from Action**

This one's huge, and most people miss it. When you break a promise, you probably tell yourself, ""I'm such a failure,"" or ""I'm so lazy,"" or ""I'll never change."" You're making the broken promise part of your identity.

Stop doing that.

A broken promise is just an action, or lack of action. It's not who you are. In Atomic Identity, James Clear, he talks about identity-based habits. But here's the flip side: don't let broken habits define your identity either.

Instead of ""I'm a person who can't stick to anything,"" try ""I'm a person who's learning to keep promises, and today I didn't keep this one, but I'll try again tomorrow."" It sounds like positive thinking, but the language you use with yourself literally rewires your brain. Neuroscience research on self-talk shows that how you frame failures directly impacts whether you'll try again.

**Step 6: Forgive Yourself (But Don't Let Yourself Off the Hook)**

There's a balance here that's tricky but essential. You need to forgive yourself for past broken promises without using forgiveness as an excuse to keep breaking them.

Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self-compassion shows that people who practice self-compassion are actually more likely to keep working toward goals, not less. Why? Because shame and guilt are paralyzing. When you beat yourself up, you feel like shit, and when you feel like shit, you give up.

So forgive yourself. Acknowledge that you're human, you're trying, and you're learning. But then immediately make a new tiny promise and keep it. Forgiveness without action is just letting yourself off the hook. Forgiveness with action is growth.

Step 7: Renegotiate When Needed

Here's something nobody talks about: sometimes you need to break a promise to yourself on purpose. Life happens. You get sick, emergencies come up, circumstances change.

The key is to renegotiate the promise before you break it. If you promised yourself you'd work out today but you're exhausted and sick, don't just skip it and feel guilty. Sit down and consciously decide: ""I'm changing today's promise to resting and drinking water. Tomorrow I'll do a 5-minute walk.""

This teaches your brain that you're still in control. You're not breaking promises, you're adapting them based on reality. There's a huge psychological difference.

**Step 8: Stack Promises with Existing Habits**

This comes straight from behavior design research. You're way more likely to keep a promise if you attach it to something you already do automatically. It's called habit stacking.

Already brush your teeth every morning? Great, your new promise is: ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do 5 pushups."" Already make coffee every day? Perfect: ""After I pour my coffee, I'll write down one thing I'm grateful for.""

The existing habit acts as a trigger for the new tiny promise. Your brain doesn't have to remember or summon willpower; it just follows the sequence. BJ Fogg's research shows this is one of the most effective ways to build new behaviors that stick.

**Step 9: Celebrate Like You Just Won the Lottery**

Most people completely skip this step and wonder why change feels so hard. Celebration is not optional. When you keep a promise to yourself, even a tiny one, you need to immediately celebrate it.

And I don't mean just thinking ""cool, I did it."" I mean, actually feel good about it. Pump your fist, say ""yes!"" out loud, do a little dance, whatever makes you feel genuinely happy for 3 seconds.

Why? Because your brain learns through dopamine. When you celebrate, you release dopamine, and your brain marks that behavior as something good that should be repeated. This is neuroscience, not just feel-good fluff.

BJ Fogg calls this ""Shine,"" and he argues it's the most overlooked part of behavior change. You need to wire in the feeling of success immediately after keeping a promise. Otherwise, your brain has no reason to care about doing it again.

 **Step 10: Build a System, Not Just Willpower**

Willpower is a garbage strategy for rebuilding self-trust. It runs out. You can't rely on it. What you need is a system that makes keeping promises easier than breaking them.

Design your environment to support your promises. Want to drink more water? Put a water bottle on your desk. Want to read more? Put a book on your pillow. Want to avoid junk food? Don't buy it in the first place.

The book Indistractable by Nir Eyal dives deep into this. He talks about how you can't fight distractions with willpower alone. You need external triggers that guide you toward your promises and remove triggers that lead to broken ones.

If you promise yourself you'll work on your side project for 30 minutes, but your phone is sitting right there, you're setting yourself up to fail. Put the phone in another room. Block distracting websites. Make breaking your promise harder and keeping it easier.

Rebuilding self-trust isn't about becoming perfect. It's about proving to yourself, one tiny promise at a time, that your word means something. That's when you say you'll do something, you actually do it. Start small, track your wins, understand your why, and build systems that support you. You're not broken. You're just out of practice.

Clipboard, Shades, and Submachine Guns

A Tale of the Technocratic Union

I exited my town car and straightened my mirror shades. It was best to make sure everything was in place. I took a Xanax and washed it down with an Americano. I was good at what I did, and I knew the risks, but that didn’t mean I was stupid.

I took a clipboard in one hand as I marched out of the car toward the 7-foot-tall anachronism of a Viking. One of his soldiers, whose animalistic features made me assume he was a “low generation” Gangrel, came at me from the side with claws extended.

I waved my free hand at him, pressing my index and middle finger to my thumb.

“No,” I said, calmly but firmly. I didn’t even need to look at him.

There was no need to waste Primal Energy. And if I was being honest, Enlightened Science wasn’t… well, it wasn’t the best part of my skill set. Give me mirror shades, a clipboard, and some coffee, and I could move mountains. Give me a mountain-moving equation, and it might take me a while.

They say a confident person with a clipboard can get into any room. The same was broadly true for vampire war parties. I looked up at the out-of-place Viking.

“Really, Erik? Would you like to explain?” I turned my clipboard toward him. The dramatic headline read: “13 Brutalized, 5 Dead after Attack at Local Mall.”

“Would you like to explain to me why I had to spend my afternoon writing this shit? I swear to fuck, Erik, if you can’t keep these vampires in line, something will be done about them.”

He leaned down and sniffed me. Something about that gesture, from mortal or vampire, always felt disturbingly intimate. He bared his fangs at me. I felt my bowels turn to water as I stood my ground.

“You know that wasn’t us, you know that was the Sabbat,” he said, thrusting his fingers at a dilapidated warehouse. “They’re in there and they are minutes from death.”

The vampires he brought with him formed a circle around us, not quite sure what to do. He hadn’t attacked me, despite the fact that his authority had been put into question by someone who smelled like a mortal. I could have sworn I saw a 404 error behind some of their eyes.

“Do you think my boss gives a shit if the ‘bad’ vampires are causing this and not the ‘other’ bad vampires? All they see are a bunch of extenuated human bodies and the crime rate going up.” I turned my head away from him as I lit a cigarette. “I would be lying if I said I hadn’t considered taking out this little gathering of yours myself. Have you ever heard of vacuum bombs? I finally got approval to requisition them. And I swear I would do it if I didn’t think the killing of all y’all would solve my problems for any longer than it takes for the new crop of vampires to move in.”

The overly ambitious vampire from earlier took a step toward me. I pulled my suit jacket back to show the oversized firearm in my holster. Truth be told, I had very little idea how to use it other than pointing it toward a target and clicking.

“Really, Froggy Joe? Are you really sure you wanna try that shit with me?”

Erik crossed his arms and leaned back. “Oh, and what was supposed to be in that? All kinds of garlic and UV lights?”

“No, just a .50 caliber hollow point. The boys down at the lab put recoil compensation into it so even my five-foot frame... nothing asks me to pull the trigger without my wrist breaking,” I said, looking at the overly aggressive baby vampire. “What’s your name, buddy?”

“Thomas,” he stuttered out.

“So yeah, the way this works out is you come for me, I pull the trigger, you end up with an exit wound the size of a frozen turkey, Erik and his pack attack me, and I die in some kind of truly grisly way, I’m assuming. Then my boss sends in a bunch of cyborgs with plasma cannons built into their chests. They prioritize that Sabbat pack in the warehouse, and any of you who get away get pulled out of your havens at 3 PM on charges of running a bestiality blood cult.”

Thomas looked at Erik. “Wait… can she…?”

Erik pinched the bridge of his nose. “Yes, she can, in fact, make that happen.”

“Then why doesn’t that happen every week? If she’s so powerful, why are any vampires left in the city? I call bullshit.”

“The reason you haven't all been nuked from orbit is because usually y’all remember how to play nice and keep your little atrocities among yourselves. However, when you cause bullshit like this, it makes me have to do paperwork, and I do not enjoy doing paperwork. Also, I’m attached to Val.” I waved to Val, an adorable cheerleader type holding two submachine guns. She waved back.

Erik looked at me. “Okay, so what is the best possible ending for this?”

“Best possible outcome,” I turned my head back to him, “is you let me tag along for this, we make sure that all of the Sabbat are even deader than they were before, and then you and I have a talk with your Harpy.”

I pulled a scroll out of my pocket and handed it to Erik.

“This is standard boilerplate shit. 'The party of the first part hereby swears to eradicate a nest of reality deviants, colloquially known as The Sabbat or The Sword of Cain(e) (sic).'” I looked up from the scroll. “You know there’s no 'E', right? Like, 'Cain’ is a word that’s been used since, like… 1382. It’s older than the language we’re speaking. What’s with the extra E?”

Erik shrugged. “Can’t help you with that one… I’m an Odinist.”

“Ah… well, you learn something new every day. Anyways. 'The party of the first part swears to do no less than their absolute best to deliver onto the agent of the New World Order (party of the second part) the Ductus or Priest of the party.' If you do, then the party of the second part promises to return whatever is left of this individual or individuals.”

I gagged a bit and didn't try to hide it; fleshcrafting was disgusting. I knew it, the vampires around me knew it, and there was no reason to pretend it didn’t make my guts churn.

“The party of the first part then guarantees safe passage to the party of the second part to the current vampire safe haven known as Elysium, where the party of the first part will ask the Harpy who the hell was sleeping on the job and politely point out that a boon is now owed to yours truly.”

Erik looked at me. “Sure… fair, I guess. You did cover this shit for us.”

“Lovely. I love how the 1,500-year-old Viking is the voice of reason in the city.” I pointed to various parts of the contract. “Now, if you could just lead here, initial here, and sign here.”

He signed where I asked him to, then handed the scroll back to me. “You know,” he said, “I really do not care for the term ‘reality deviant.’ It comes across as extremely judgmental and dehumanizing.”

“I mean, I hate to be that girl, but you are, in fact, not a human.” I shoved the scroll in my pocket.

Reality (Noun): The state of things as they actually exist; the world as it is, independent of perceptions, beliefs, or deviations.

Deviant (Noun): Departing from a norm or standard, especially in behavior, thought, or structure.

 Reality Deviant (Noun): Something or someone that deviates from the accepted or standard reality—something that does not conform to the established, observable, or expected rules of how the world works.

I looked over my shoulder at him. “E.g., the walking dead.”

I winked at Valerie. “You don’t mind being a little reality deviant, do you?”",2,1770242330.0,WhiteWolfRPG,0,1.0,False
1qw2dmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1qw2dmd/my_journey_with_agoraphobia/,My journey with agoraphobia,"I'm still struggling with this and I would really love to read your advice.

I'm 17 years old and my story is a bit confusing. It all started around September 2025 with mild derealization, but it happened very rarely. Sometimes I would feel it while running to catch my bus and in a certain spot near my house (always the same place), and I would just think my blood pressure was dropping or something similar. It scared me, but not too much, and I could stop the sensation. But in November 2025, I started fasting for 16 and 20 hours. My only companion was coffee, and sometimes I drank up to 5 cups a day.


But the time I had my first anxiety attack was at the beginning of January when I was coming back from getting my nails done. It was 2:30 in the afternoon, and I had only eaten breakfast very early. After walking for about 20 minutes in the sun, I started to feel derealization. I stopped it, but after walking a little further, I felt such strong derealization that I almost panicked. But since my sister was with me, I calmed down as best I could and stopped it. Then I waited for about 5 minutes in front of my house because a truck was blocking the way. That day was when my fear of going out began. I cried that same day because of the fear, but I thought it was a health issue. I spent a week going to the store, sometimes alone, and I just forgot what had happened. I did cardio all week and drank my coffee, and nothing seemed to be happening. But one Saturday night, I went to the store and felt such a strong sense of derealization that I was fighting to keep from panicking. I ran home crying, terrified, with a very cold feeling in my chest. That was the scariest part because it reminded me of a childhood trauma, and I felt like I wasn't myself. But the next day, I went to the same store with my sister, and nothing happened. That night, she asked me to go to another store, and I didn't have the courage to go, which only increased my fear. I spent two days in bed, unable to even go to the bathroom quickly because of the fear and a terrible headache. I begged to be taken to a psychologist or psychiatrist and given medication. On the third day, I decided to stop lying in bed and go to a clothing store very close to my house. After walking about 20 steps from my house, it started again. I crossed my street without really feeling like I was walking. I couldn't find many clothes, and my desperation came and went, but I never felt calm. The derealization was intense, and I spent about 25 minutes in that place. It was small and hot. I cried a lot when I got home. I was so scared and wanted to go to the bathroom, but I was afraid to go. So, in a fit of anger, I went and went into the bathroom, telling myself that I could be in that place. I showered without so much fear, and the next day I was able to spend less time in bed and feel calmer. From that day on, I decided to gradually return to my routine, and cleaning my house helped me a lot.


That day I decided to face it and started going to the store little by little. After about 7 days, I went to my friend's house, but by car because I was afraid to take the bus or walk. But that same day I went to the supermarket, and I walked from her house, and I think that was the biggest challenge, and I did it. When I got to her house, I felt mild derealization again, but it was because I drank Coca-Cola, and that day I let it all out with her. I cried a lot and explained many things to her, and she understood why everything happened the way it did. Two days later, my worst headache hit, triggering a near-fatal attack. I managed to stop it unintentionally, just not paying it any mind. When it subsided, I felt confused because it was gone so quickly. The next day, I had a sleepover at my friend's house. I didn't want to arrive five minutes early, but I realized it was just anxiety, so I decided to go. The drinks were great, and I walked to a Dollar City (about five minutes away). Everything was fine. I felt derealized and was close to despairing, but I managed. Five days later, I decided to walk 25 minutes away from my house for something important, and everything was fine. Four days later, I went back to the same place and had to wait outside for about 30 minutes. It helped distract me to browse Pinterest. Then, I went twice more to a store about four minutes from my house.


Yesterday I went to the store, and I think I overthought things. I did feel a bit more derealized, and for a second I felt close to despairing, but I just relaxed and kept walking home. I don't have derealization episodes at home anymore, and when one tries to hit me, I just ignore it and carry on. But what worries me sometimes is going out.",4,1770242288.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

My (34F) mental health has been particularly bad the past few years, he said we've grown apart and due to lack of affection/intimacy/my lack of motivation to get up in the morning/go out and be social etc, and he doesn't love me anymore. He didnt move into his own place until about 3 weeks ago, staying at 'a friends' house most nights, or sleeping downstairs. I did not want to break up, i still dont and at this point i dont know if i ever will. He has been the love of my life since we were 16/17, we had an amazing relationship until a couple years ago. I'm on the right medication now and am doing much better, except for the breakup.

A week ago i found out he has been seeing someone new, said they got together after we split but i think she was the catalyst for him leaving me. After having a long cry i impulsively signed up to an online dating site the next day and matched with someone (40M) pretty much straight away. We've been talking alot every day since, met once in person for coffee and have a couple dates planned over the next couple of weeks. We have loads in common and he has been very gracious about my financial situation/mental health etc.

The problem now is, i realised the next date we have is on what would have been my 18 year anniversary with my ex. I think realising that gave me some clarity and, although he is a lovely person and has been so sweet and patient, i realised im not ready for someone else, it isnt fair to me and mostly him. Honestly i think i just wanted to feel wanted again.

I feel like the worst person in the world. I should never have signed up for dating and hate that ive now put a nice person in this position who doesnt deserve it. I dont know what to do, or what to say, or how to say it. I can feel my anxiety spiking just thinking about having to explain to him that although he is a genuinely nice person who has done nothing wrong, i cant see him again. I dont want to hurt him because he doesnt deserve it, its only been a week but feels like we've been moving quite quickly emotionally. He says im special and looks forward to being together etc.

I dont know what to do and any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know I've done a bad thing and i want to fix it and well as i can.

TL;DR
17 year relationship ended, after finding out ex started seeing someone i almost immediately met someone online. Now i realise i shouldn't be dating right now but don't know how to end things as kindly as possible after setting up a date for next week",0,1770242253.0,relationship_advice,11,0.5,False

Seems like someone was sending secret code involving her dad.

I noticed a few strangers in city hall. Aino kept telling me ""Tell you when I can."" Everything making sense now.

They tracked one sender to Newtown. There will be a group of soldiers doing a sweep there soon. Hopefully discover who is sending them. (See BOSF Radio Intelligence 4)

That would explain why we still have security on us.

Anyways time to get breakfast and get to work.

I will have to calculate shipping in costs of 8x8 or ... Wait I will talk talk to Aino. We need contracts to be written that includes a clause that indicates purchaser covers shipping.

Aino agreed he will take care of contracrs for 8x8.

Need more materiel for fabricaters. Ordered some. 2 weeks delivery.

Received the Pipes for the 4th Generator of Newtown. Marcus sending construction workers in the next two days. Repairs will start tomorrow.


Two Ykanties were the guards at City Hall. Notices they carry laser weapons. They carried a small shield. It looked like Scales on the shield.

When I asked about the shields they said proudly ""Mam. The Scales are from Razorclaws we hunted a few days ago. Very strong and we fired bullets at them on the range. We got many mid scize Razors and took hours to cut off the scales.""

They sounded so proud.

Given the afternoon off so will go to the beach. Also took my throwing knives got for me. Might practice some more on Elisabeth's wood target.

Noticed on my way to the beach. Many more foot patrols. 

Saw a new electric car with workers. Just a small one looking like a mini bus.

1900 Thats it getting Marcus to hide the Black Rifle coffee. Elisabeth needs to drink more tea as she is bouncing all over the place. We will control how many she as a day.

I care for Liz and know she is under stress. She needs to concentrate more and the coffee is not helping.

We used to wipe the trays down and put a paper down, but recently the upper management had a genius idea. We now have permanent 'anti slip' texture on the trays so everything gets stuck in the little bumps (and it doesn't even work as intendet). I am 19 and have been working there for over two years, my sister is the manager and I've managed to become one of the best workers we have even if I am just part time. Today I was the shift lead, filling on for a person, and a woman came up to me with a complaint. As always I walked up to her, calmly asked what happened, the usual stuff. She said that her tray was dirty and she wanted it to be clean. I explained that due to the texture the dirt is stuck there, and she said ""you just need some sand and patience."" She also complained about having a crumb on her plate... From the cake that was on that plate... I didn't even tell her that I was the shift lead at first, just calmly explained to her that the texture of the trays causes the stains to soak in and we literally can't wash it. Also explained that the mess on her plate was a crumb from her cake. I was polite, calm, profesional but she kept on repeating the same thing, so  eventually my manager noticed. She came over, asked what happened, the woman said the same thing she said to me and my sister literally repeated what I said. The woman said that you just need a bit of cleaning sand and elbow grease, my sister said that this was not possible at such a busy place (we are in the middle of a central square in the city). The woman got even more mad, stormed off, I thought it was over. I went back to my job, she came up to me again and was like ""I want to speak to whoever is leading this shift.""

She stormed off, wrecked havoc on my sister, giving both of us shit for something we can't affect. My sister ended up crying, I was shaking.

When I got to his place, he suggested going to another couple’s place and that the four of us do it. At first I didn’t want to (I’m pretty vanilla haha), but then I agreed. It was after a party, so it was around 3 a.m. when we got to this couple’s apartment. They had all kinds of drugs and alcohol. And well, we all did it. The problem is that throughout everything I connected a lot with one guy from the couple—we’ll call him JP. So much so that I spent all Sunday locked in his room with him, using all kinds of stuff and having sex; his partner had a family thing, so he left the apartment to him alone.

I left his place Sunday night and he started calling me. During the week, we went for coffee, took walks, watched movies, and I connected with him a lot. I feel like he understands me and I understand him.

Saturday came again and he wanted to use drugs and drink again; I agreed, but that’s when I found out that his boyfriend didn’t like him going out alone with me. And it turns out they have an agreement that they’re in an open relationship (which I understood as meaning they can see whoever they want), but that’s not actually how it is. They only do threesomes together.

A month has gone by and I’m falling hard for him. I see him on Saturdays because his boyfriend works in another city that day, and I see him sometimes when he gets off work—he comes over to my place for a couple of hours.

But am I the third wheel? I don’t want to fall more in love because I understood everything as if they were open and he could have other partners, but apparently that’s not the case.

If it helps, we had three wild nights in total.

The first one was all together, and the other two were just the two of us. The rest of the time we either slept or talked for hours.

When I ask him about his partner, he just says that he ‘doesn’t want to make him angry,’ and that’s why he hides it. But that what we’re doing isn’t wrong, and that he cares about me too.

So, a bit rougher than usual.

It's funny to write both of them as they both have their own flavor of strong personalities.

Of course, it's another exclusive snippet to the Sanctuary.

Please have fun reading.

I will post a comment here, summarizing the plot for those who lack time or want to get straighter in the concept.

------
Emily was minding her own business as usual in heaven. She liked to feel the wind with her winds even when she wasn't flying. It was a pity one of them was no longer here.

As her various thoughts distracted her, she didn’t notice the shadow who approached her.

With a swift and instantaneous move, the songbird was captured.

Emily woke up hearing water drip from a ceiling. She was a bit dazed and tried to move. But her movement was limited.
She felt some pressure at her arms and feet.

Then, she felt a strange contact, her muscles twitched under what appeared to be ropes.
Emily wanted to yell, but she couldn't at all as she gasped at what she saw.

A strange shadow arrived in the cave. A shadow who reeked metal, death and grief.
2 glowing eyes were staring at her.

Emily's mind was racing like a rocket.
No such bad things happens in hell.

Then the light suddenly struck like a train, revealing the figure.
Emily recognized Lute at a glance.
She was... for a lack of a better word, unwell. 

Her traits were abrased and tired as if she was a minute away from getting a nap. Yet she had an energy that reminded Emily of someone swimming as hard as possible not to dive a last time in the abyss. Gravity elongated every movement, every sentence as if this exorcist forgot she had wings to fly.

Lute snapped at the moment reaching Emily like a hawk putting her claws on her.
""Now with you as my hostage, Sera will finally give me back what belong to me... be it...""

Emily's mind went blank for a few minutes as she was absolutely astonished. The feeling of danger just blew away in seconds like an overbaked cake.
She didn’t listen much the words of this reckless one. 

The sentence escaped her lips.

""That's... just... dumb""

The hawk snapped back an expression of pure ravenous fury on her face.

""What... did you... just say... ?""

The Pandora's box was open. She might as well continue on this road.

""Lute, you're an exorcist, right ? You know the difference in power between you and Adam, do you ?""

The fierce captor was a bit taken apart by the question, not exactly knowing where it would land.

""... yep, Adam was an archangel and... he was so powerful... what do…""

Instinct or maybe a hint of exasperation made the seraphim complete the sentence.

""... I mean that next to Adam, you're almost powerless. And Adam next to Lucifer is almost powerless by comparison too. Lucifer is a seraphim, albeit fallen. And, well even if not all Seraphims are on the same level of power as Lucifer or are that combat attuned, I think you can do the math""

Lute's sleep-deprived mind who only managed to hold up thanks to pure rage, coffee and her own personal mental coach -thanks Adam - started to have a rare moment of clarity which was spitted out of frustration.

""Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck""

Emily gently put the last nail in the coffin.

""And what would think will happen once everyone know I disappeared?

It's not like the angels would be able to find thanks to various powers that exist here in heaven""

The mind of the fierce warrior slowly unraveled as the various conflicting and failed attempts were slowly starting.

""But, and Adam... who will avenge him?
And the sinners? And the one eyed bitch traitor?

Why nothing work?!!!

No... no one get it....
The other exorcists don't want to help...
We're letting scum enter....

I tried everything and each time I meet a wall... days !! Weeks !!! Months !!!!

All wasted !!!.

I...
I..
I.

Don't they see the sinners are a danger ?
Adam... and now breaking the... gates....

Can't someone get it that I am trying to protect heaven !!!

Can't... ""

Once again, Emily's mouth acted on her own as the last sentence triggered her off, cutting Lute in her rambles.
The exorcist managed to make her genuinely angry. 

For once, the storm switched sides.

""Protector !!! Are you kidding me ?
Where were you when Sera sent you to help ?!!!
Oh, God, I know, you were trying to fight Vaggi off for your stupid revenge....

Thanks to you, I lost my wing in the process and I almost died....

I... don’t know how to deal with that Lute.

Every day, I wake up.

Nothing changed around me.

The same persons. The same routine.

Yet, I feel it pounding.

My heart. I still have nightmares of that day.

And, still people need me. They need my joy. And each day, I feel like I am lying to them. Because what happened this day in hell wasn't okay at all.

And each time, I go to hell for the hell, I am scared for my life.

And... each... time, I remember that Sera would never back down, and I continue because I have to do so. But... but..

So, don't you dare say you are a protector, nor that you value heaven's interests!!... Don’t... just... Don’t....""

As the night sky that constituted the face of the seraphim was finally conquered by rain, the metal arm suddenly slides off with a brutal yet decisive movement.
Yet her voice lost her edge.

""Then, I even failed at being a protector.""

Emily was freed and in tears. She barely sprouted a word out.

""What?

A calmer than calm voice answered softly with resignation until it stopped as the soldier let out a sigh.

""Go, you're right... do what you want... I am not worth it... and I will fail anyway...""

Emily enjoyed moving, yet stopped as something arose in her. It was a moment of strange clarity.

""I see, then I failed at my job too.""

The words pierced the clouds and reached directly the heart. 

""Em...""

The Seraphim took the lead.

""Oh, my god...

I.. I failed, because I let one person in heaven get so sad in front of me and I didn't even see it.

Or maybe, I didn't want to...

I was so conflicted with how you reacted back then. And frankly, I still don't share the same opinion as you.

But, I shouldn't have let you be like that.

I should have done something like with these exorcists I helped before.. I knew about the exterminations... but... it's different with you.

And... frankly... I... didn’t know that feeling like I know it today.

This sensation, this cold burning...

This is eating at you even right now ?""

Only a silence was heard as an answer.
The purple robed girl then answered to all that moment meant as words couldn't convey what was going beyond the acts and the exchange.

""Listen to me...
I won't denounce you under one condition.
You will work under me, effective from now on and I will closely have my attention on you at any moments.

Do any suspicious things, or try to get away and with what happened right now, you will be made fallen, I'll guarantee you that.

Never.. Ever.. Take my kindness for weakness. 

Don’t forget that even if I lived in heaven, it was for eons.

But as my friend Jesus said, it starts with sorry. And you deserve a chance...""

The hawk like girl simply nodded being taken aback by her attitude to be even more confused as the seraphim tightly put her arms around her. She softly whispered.

""What... that... is ?""

The high Seraphim who didn't let the hold fade away now simply let her conviction speak for herself, although there was some remaining anger in her voice.

""Mandatory hug session, you dumb bitch !!""

Emily then gasped cursing her potty mouth while Lute was a bit delighted at the situation. She shot a snarky remark.

""Great, I thought you were a capable leader for a moment""

""Luuuute....""

""Then show me. It's not like I have nothing left to do. You hold the cards, dear...""

-------

Time passed.
A decade later, Lute and Emily after what can only be called a roller coaster on an emotional level were finally happy together.

This cheerful one was probably an alchemist too as she showed Lute how all her bad traits could be great without even really trying. Lute even came to cherish every moment with her other half be they bad or good.

The former exorcist looked lovingly at her pendant. Some part was made of the rope that served to tie Emily back then.
And this was their secret...

What a crazy story to tell, don't you think?

But what made her smile was the fact that the inscription reads:
""To make better use even of bad days""
Frankly, Emily will always be Emily. 

And nothing can handle that true character of her.

Then, her mind clicked about the exorcists she helped. 

Small gestures of kindness from someone who didn't know the exterminations back then. She did precise a bit more after their first true encounter.

The timeline clicks too. Some exorcists were less and less enthusiasts about her jobs. This ended up in demotions, and then it culminated in Vaggi's rebellion.

The thought came to struck in her mind.
Emily probably set up the long chain of dominos with her usual kindness without even knowing it.

Lute was tempted to talk of that to her, but she knows her soulmate will always get back to her with that. So, she chuckled a bit.

A confused seraphim in a night dress arrived for dinner. Stress were eating her up away as she was overpreparing.

""Lute, why are you laughing ? And we’re so going to be laaaaaaaate....""

Lute closed the pendant satisfied with an enigmatic smile.

The comforting arms of the fierce women closely melted the worries of the 6 winged beauty as it did many times through storms and traumas.

There are so many funny scenes and lines in this if I quoted them all it would end up being most of the script… but here goes anyway lol

Count and the hammer to nail Vlad in.

Ingrid “Can I watch?”

Clever word games with the Van Helsings

Coughing up wool

“I’ll knit something. Small.”

Mr Cuddles! Poor Mr Cuddles…

And the subsequent “Lock up your teddies!”

Vlad definitely more bold and defiant with his dad this season.

So much foreshadowing in the naw choosing scene:

“She doesn’t love dad, she loves Patrick”

“He’s all man, like his father” (Magda couldn’t possibly be saying that about the Count”) followed immediately by “Yes there’s life in the old dog yet”

Who filmed the start of the Branagh’s breakfast scene? Edgar Wright?

“You won’t get away with it you beautiful freak!”

“That is a designer coffee table with a handy body shaped space underneath” haha in denial much?

Vlad’s still watching out for his Dad, continuing theme.

Vlad shot a fireball! And he was so proud of himself! Poor Zoltan!

Then so cringey when he couldn’t.

Would he have been so happy to have further proof he can’t stop becoming a vampire if he wasn’t trying to win back his Dad’s favour?

I am low-key annoyed that circumstances meant Van Helsing didn’t declare a truce, and was reignited.

Shame Ingrid’s plan didn’t work out because of it either! Poor Ingrid’s coffin!

Dressed as sheep to catch the Count. “How can it fail?”

“By the powers of chaos and evil - ready with the party poppers everyone - “

Clever of Vlad to reveal the truth.

Wow Magda. Just wow.

Count doing proper scary wall crawling.

Vlad showing his overwhelming goodness by saving the baby/puppy, despite what had happened before.

The whole Count rubbing Vlad’s face in the fact he didn’t “chose” to be his son and heir; part of me wonders how much the Count really meant it, it being a bit of a lesson to Vlad. Especially the after Ingrid stated “He’s got to be in trouble now”, but the Count merely congratulated him on standing up to his mother. And it worked - Vlad realised he did miss the attention and favours (got a bit of a taste of how it feels to not be the favourite), and, on top of that, completely willingly accepted the ceremony to be named the Count’s official son and heir.

“Barry” haha.

Yesterday, I tried VERY diluted caffeinated drink to see if it would be better now… It was a night of fussiness and constant wakings. 

I don’t really need the caffeine tbh, it never woke me up, but I loved the taste. I’m avoiding decaf, I read that it is not very healthy due to the way the caffeine is extracted. I want to explore substitutes but I’m out of ideas.

What I’ve tried so far:

\- caramel oat milk

\- rooibos tea (I read that it also increases milk production)

\- pumpkin spice drink

\- hot chocolate

\- cocoa drinks

\- lucuma powder drink

I am a first-time mom expecting a baby in the fall. We are both in our early 30s. We'd love your opinion on neighborhoods and rentals in Green Lake, Wallingford, or Roosevelt. We're hoping for the following:

- a 5-10 min walking distance to groceries, a local coffee shop, and local stores. Bonus if it's not too hilly. 
- safe for mom to walk solo with baby and meet other moms
-short walking/biking distance to a Lightrail station, so husband can commute to work
- under 10-15 minute drive to UW Medical Center Montlake or Northwest

We're open to renting a house, condo, or apartment. I realize that thin-walled apartment-living isn't the most ideal with a newborn, but we're not the first to raise babies in apartments, and we won't be the last. Our budget is $2.8-3K per month for a 1B1B and we'll be bringing 1 car.

My mental health has been particularly bad the past few years, he said we've grown apart and due to lack of affection/intimacy/my lack of motivation to get up in the morning/go out and be social etc, and he doesn't love me anymore. He didnt move into his own place until about 3 weeks ago, staying at 'a friends' house most nights, or sleeping downstairs. I did not want to break up, i still dont and at this point i dont know if i ever will. He has been the love of my life since we were 16/17, we had an amazing relationship until a couple years ago. I'm on the right medication now and am doing much better, except for the breakup.

A week ago i found out he has been seeing someone new, said they got together after we split but i think she was the catalyst for him leaving me. After having a long cry i impulsively signed up to an online dating site the next day and matched with someone pretty much straight away. We've been talking alot every day since, met once in person for coffee and have a couple dates planned over the next couple of weeks. We have loads in common and he has been very gracious about my financial situation/mental health etc.

The problem now is, i realised the next date we have is on what would have been my 18 year anniversary with my ex. I think realising that gave me some clarity and, although he is a lovely person and has been so sweet and patient, i realised im not ready for someone else, it isnt fair to me and mostly him. Honestly i think i just wanted to feel wanted again.

I feel like the worst person in the world. I should never have signed up for dating and hate that ive now put a nice person in this position who doesnt deserve it. I dont know what to do, or what to say, or how to say it. I can feel my anxiety spiking just thinking about having to explain to him that although he is a genuinely nice person who has done nothing wrong, i cant see him again. I dont want to hurt him because he doesnt deserve it, its only been a week but feels like we've been moving quite quickly emotionally. He says im special and looks forward to being together etc.

It's raining again, and the sound of it feels less like weather and more like memory, each drop a quiet knock from that night, that fucking night when everything splintered and slipped out of my hands. It was raining on that day too. Rain has a way of dragging the past back into the room uninvited, and when it does, the anger never goes looking for anyone else but me.

I replay it endlessly, the moment | learned the truth about someone | let close, someone I cared for in a way I hadn't allowed myself to care for anyone beyond my mother and my brother in a very long time, someone I trusted enough to lower my guard around, only to discover that what I was holding onto was built entirely out of lies. Maybe that's the cruelest part, not that she deceived me, but that I fell in love with a version of her that only existed in my head, a carefully imagined person stitched together from hope, longing, and selective blindness.

And so the question keeps circling like a storm that refuses to move on, how could I be so stupid? I used to take pride in my instincts, in my ability to read people like open books, to notice the pauses between words, the cracks in stories, the truths hidden in silence, it was the one thing I thought I was way too good at, the skill I trusted when everything else felt uncertain. Yet somehow, spectacularly, I failed at the very thing I believed defined me, and that realization cuts deeper than the betrayal itself.

Now I sit here with a coffee cooling in one hand and a cigarette burning down in the other, watching smoke dissolve into the same grey air as the rain, wondering how I can reclaim the part of myself I lost that night, my certainty, my trust in my own judgment and how I'm supposed to move forward when every step feels like walking on ground I no longer recognize. The rain keeps falling, steady and relentless, as if reminding me that confidence can erode quietly, that even the sharpest judgment can blur when mixed with hope, and that sometimes the hardest truth to accept isn't about who betrayed you, but about learning how to forgive yourself and choose to keep going anyway.

But there is one thing I know now, with a clarity sharpened by regret and rain, no matter what, I will never make the same mistake again, never hand over my faith so carelessly, never ignore the quiet alarms inside me, and if there's one constant I cling to in this moment, it's this cigarette between my fingers, burning, honest, predictable and the certainty that loving it, like this hard-earned resolve, is something I'm never going to let go of.",1,1770240463.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False
1qw1jub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1qw1jub/my_battle_with_agoraphobia/,My battle with agoraphobia,"I'm still struggling with this and I would really love to read your advice.

I'm 17 years old and my story is a bit confusing. It all started around September 2025 with mild derealization, but it happened very rarely. Sometimes I would feel it while running to catch my bus and in a certain spot near my house (always the same place), and I would just think my blood pressure was dropping or something similar. It scared me, but not too much, and I could stop the sensation. But in November 2025, I started fasting for 16 and 20 hours. My only companion was coffee, and sometimes I drank up to 5 cups a day.


But the time I had my first anxiety attack was at the beginning of January when I was coming back from getting my nails done. It was 2:30 in the afternoon, and I had only eaten breakfast very early. After walking for about 20 minutes in the sun, I started to feel derealization. I stopped it, but after walking a little further, I felt such strong derealization that I almost panicked. But since my sister was with me, I calmed down as best I could and stopped it. Then I waited for about 5 minutes in front of my house because a truck was blocking the way. That day was when my fear of going out began. I cried that same day because of the fear, but I thought it was a health issue. I spent a week going to the store, sometimes alone, and I just forgot what had happened. I did cardio all week and drank my coffee, and nothing seemed to be happening. But one Saturday night, I went to the store and felt such a strong sense of derealization that I was fighting to keep from panicking. I ran home crying, terrified, with a very cold feeling in my chest. That was the scariest part because it reminded me of a childhood trauma, and I felt like I wasn't myself. But the next day, I went to the same store with my sister, and nothing happened. That night, she asked me to go to another store, and I didn't have the courage to go, which only increased my fear. I spent two days in bed, unable to even go to the bathroom quickly because of the fear and a terrible headache. I begged to be taken to a psychologist or psychiatrist and given medication. On the third day, I decided to stop lying in bed and go to a clothing store very close to my house. After walking about 20 steps from my house, it started again. I crossed my street without really feeling like I was walking. I couldn't find many clothes, and my desperation came and went, but I never felt calm. The derealization was intense, and I spent about 25 minutes in that place. It was small and hot. I cried a lot when I got home. I was so scared and wanted to go to the bathroom, but I was afraid to go. So, in a fit of anger, I went and went into the bathroom, telling myself that I could be in that place. I showered without so much fear, and the next day I was able to spend less time in bed and feel calmer. From that day on, I decided to gradually return to my routine, and cleaning my house helped me a lot.


That day I decided to face it and started going to the store little by little. After about 7 days, I went to my friend's house, but by car because I was afraid to take the bus or walk. But that same day I went to the supermarket, and I walked from her house, and I think that was the biggest challenge, and I did it. When I got to her house, I felt mild derealization again, but it was because I drank Coca-Cola, and that day I let it all out with her. I cried a lot and explained many things to her, and she understood why everything happened the way it did. Two days later, my worst headache hit, triggering a near-fatal attack. I managed to stop it unintentionally, just not paying it any mind. When it subsided, I felt confused because it was gone so quickly. The next day, I had a sleepover at my friend's house. I didn't want to arrive five minutes early, but I realized it was just anxiety, so I decided to go. The drinks were great, and I walked to a Dollar City (about five minutes away). Everything was fine. I felt derealized and was close to despairing, but I managed. Five days later, I decided to walk 25 minutes away from my house for something important, and everything was fine. Four days later, I went back to the same place and had to wait outside for about 30 minutes. It helped distract me to browse Pinterest. Then, I went twice more to a store about four minutes from my house.


Yesterday I went to the store, and I think I overthought things. I did feel a bit more derealized, and for a second I felt close to despairing, but I just relaxed and kept walking home. I don't have derealization episodes at home anymore, and when one tries to hit me, I just ignore it and carry on. But what worries me sometimes is going out.",2,1770240440.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

But times like right now, when I have exams, make me realize that maybe I’m not as ready as I think I am. 

I seem to have a very hard time focusing on multiple things at once, and I don’t mean multitasking but more of I am apparently very very shit at taking care of myself when I try to do my best to study for my exams, cause I can’t seem to give anything less than 100%. I can’t seem to focus more energie at important parts of my life at the same time. 

Like after a pretty hard exam some of my college friends suggested we go eat in celebration. But plans got changed and we went and got coffee (hot chocolate) instead. I ended up not eating anything until late in the evening that day because I cannot go and eat when I’m supposed to “socialize “ and I felt bad asking if we maybe could go to a restaurant or smt instead or abandoning them when we hadn’t spend any time together. And I wasn’t able to eat anything before the exam either cause I get extremely anxious and jsut throw it up.

I am scared of a normal 9-5 working environment and anything corporate even tho it’s probably going to earn me the most money to be able to do other things liek you know…eat…and live. I’ve worked before ofc but only on a farm, or in a very relaxed summer job or in a dog hotel which I all loved but they were all flexible in the way where I was barely even forced to mask and even as a receptionist I barely had contact with people. 

I don’t understand how people seem to have so many more hours in a day, like some even have full blown relationships, with a job, college, renting their own apartment, active social life, going on trips all at the same time. And here I feel like three major things in my life (college, taking care of myself -food, drink, cleaning, doing my hobby- maintaining a relatively healthy social relationship with college and special interest friends) is already too much and  going to therapy/psychiatrist feels like an extra burden already and I kind of want to not go anymore cause it’s making me more stressed.

And she knows it’s hard but I’ve never really told her these things and I feel like I’ll disappoint her so much when I’m going to have to live my own adult life. And she’s been very supportive and accepting of both my diagnosis’s but I’m afraid that if I don’t mask, if I end up not functioning as well as I seemed until now she’ll be disappointed or telling me to get over it or think I’m blaming it on my AuDHD.

1qw1e3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1qw1e3k/met_up_with_my_ex/,Met up with my ex,"Met up with my ex last night

I (34M) met up with my ex (31F) last night and talk about conflicting emotions.

I’m not gonna get too deep into the break up, but basically we were together for like five months. We went out with one of her friends I had never met before. Of course we were drinking all night and her friend is just pretty nasty to me and at one point I’ve had enough and I left. At the time I felt my ex was not defending me, so I just got up and left. I didn’t abandoned my ex at the bar because she showed up with her friend. But right afterwards I had sent her a a few angry text messages. Not directed at my ex but about how disrespected I felt by her friend and how I felt that she just stood by and did nothing. They were definitely pretty angry. I don’t remember word for word but I’ll die on the hill that they weren’t directed at her. It was directed at the situation. It was a stupid fucking drunk blowup. And then to make it worse after I left, she had called, i didnt answer, I turned off my location and I went home and I didn’t call her until the next evening. And she said she was having anxiety attacks the whole day because she didn’t know what was going on until I called her.

I’m fully aware I fucked up. But before that, we had a great relationship. I was a little emotionally guarded together but I apologized for that. But we never fought, never had an argument, if there was a problem, we talked about it like adults and moved on. I did care for her and she knows I did. I just needed to be more open. But I was getting there. I was working on it through therapy, and we just started evolving our relationship. She was just out pacing  me. We were together for five months and I told her I was scared that if I let her in fully, she was going to hurt me. And I kind of did to her what I thought she might do to me. And that was never my intention But after talking, I had triggered something in her that happened in her past and she couldn’t move past that. So we broke up. I had issues in my past relationships that affected ours, and she did too.

Fast forward six months, I’m browsing TikTok and I see something that she may like and I’m in my feels so I sent it to her. I don’t know why. We hadn’t talked since we broke up. But something just didn’t feel right about all that. It ended so abruptly.

A few days later, she sends one back. I send one back a little bit later. Over the next six weeks, they get more frequent, more flirty, more intimate. I cracked at one point and apologized again for what I did and she basically said she just doesn’t wanna reopen that door. I totally understood and asked if she ever wanted to meet up for coffee and catch up I’d like that. To my surprise, she said yes.

About a week later we meet up. We had a nice conversation that lasted about two hours.

She said she hated me for a while, which was understandable. That she went through a hard depression episode and had lots of anxiety, lots of doubt. It was incredibly hard for her. She told me she didn’t know if I even liked her when we were together. But I did and I told her I liked even when we were together. But I’ve been in a relationship with an avoidant before and I know how words feel versus actions. And then I became one, never intending to. It just happened.

But as time went on those angry feelings faded for her. And she started to appreciate the good times we had. She thinks if we got back together, she wouldn’t be able to move past what I triggered. Which is understandable. She said she wanted to be friends though, and I said I couldn’t do that. I don’t wanna hear about who you’re dating when you do. Even if you don’t date anybody we’re both still attached a little bit. Me obviously more so. And being in connection isn’t going to help.

I didn’t know what my plan was when I reached out. I just missed talking to her. I would’ve gotten back together, but I’m not about to argue for it. I didn’t know how much feelings I had left until I saw her last night. And that dug up a lot. I didn’t try to defend my actions. Only apologize for them and give her the chance to tell me how they made her feel. And holy fuck that broke my heart.

We said we’ll see each other again, but I don’t know if I can do that. I may just call her in a few days and tell her that I’ve enjoyed talking to her again, but this is becoming very hard for me. And I basically told her that last night. She knows exactly how I still feel. She didn’t shut it down, she didn’t tell me she doesn’t feel the same way. But there’s clearly a block here that she doesn’t think she can get over, and I don’t want to be with somebody who can’t fully lean in again.

I don’t really know what the point of this post is. I’m really happy we met, but I’m really sad now. I’m sad that I lost somebody who genuinely cared for me and that I had a big part of that. I’ve never been the cause of a relationship failing before. So that’s very tough for me to deal with. I’ve been eating myself alive for the last six months and it does feel freeing to tell her that. I truly care about her a lot, I was starting to love her. I just didn’t know how to say it yet. But I put it all on the table last night. And so did she. But for the last six months I had just had this nagging thought that something wasn’t right. And that got answered last night.

And this is such a change of pace because anytime I have reached out to an ex before that they told me to fuck off. And I eventually leaned into anger to get over them. I can’t do that with her though. I’m the one who fucked up and even though we got some clarity and we’re good with each other and we still care for each other. That’s gotta be that.

We’re still talking today. But I know the expiration date is coming up soon. She knows that too.",1,1770240094.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Played around with different timings, ratios, and temperatures after being inspired by a video from Memli Coffee Lab and ended up with almost the exact same recipe he uses in his video. The only main difference in my recipe is that the ratio is a bit higher, as I just like more coffee and a little higher extraction.

Recipe:

Gear Needed:

Hario V60 

Hario Switch

Paragon and Cooling Ball

Cafe Abaca 01 Filter

Scale

Recipe: 

250g of 95c Water 

15g Coffee

\~1:17 Ratio

Dose 15g of Coffee and grind a little bit coarser than normal Pour over. 

Wet and warm carafe, filter, and filter paper using 95c Water. 

Put grinds into wet filter and turn paragon lens so that the cooling ball is located under filter spout. 

Water 95c 

First Bloom

Once bed is leveled, pour 60g with switch open. Slow Circular motion from high up. Ensure to wet entire bed. You want to agitate coffee bed pretty strongly here to extract volatile aromas and have extraction cooling work optimally. 

Second Bloom

\~0:40 

Move paragon lens away from the spout. 

\*While switch is still open

40g Pour with a medium height. Circular motion. This ensures that extraction cooling is not prolonged and begins to capture unwanted aromatics that are more present after the coffee bed has been initially extracted. 

Third Pour

\~1:15 

Immediately when coffee bed begins to settle and the bubbles/foam begin to dissipate begins third pour. 

\*With Switch CLOSED

Pour 150g at low height to coffee bed to ensure low agitation. Slow circular movements. And let immersion brew for 1 minute. 

\~2:00-2:30 

Open switch and drain. 

Final Serving

Wait for coffee bed to settle and appear drained. Stir Coffee in carafe and serve.

I tried to organize a couple things, like a florist masterclass, or a coffee making workshop, but those places seem to ignore my calls / messages, most likely due to me not speaking the language.

I have some people I can consider as ""friends"" but if our relationship stopped I wouldn't be really affected. I've always been part of a group when I was younger (never been harassed or anything), but it never was something I searched and each time people just liked me and add me to their group. I learned to mask by going from group to group (nerds, gym guys, girls group...) but I've never learned to make friend, each time life just made me skip that part and placed me in multiples social interactions without having to do anything (at least that's how I see it).
I've always lived or searched for a lonely life, I don't like most of the people or even being with some people I like. But I think my self isolation is something getting more and more difficult to live with. I feel different from all the others, I know that I'm lonely and that it's slowly getting me depressed but I just can't make friends or even understand how to socially work with friends.

My girlfriend, who's also a ""few-friends"" person, told me that I should try to see the few people I already know and see what happen, if that can strengthen our relationship or idk by going for a drink once a week or month by example. I just asked her ""But why ? Why should I see people without any reason even if I suffer from deep loneliness ?"" I dont understand what to do when there's someone I feel close to. 
I saw one of my only ""friends"" because I had a job interview close to where she lives (we live in the same city) and after saying goodbye and that we could see each other if I'm coming there again she told me ""We can also hang out without you needing to come here, like grab a coffee downtown!"". And again the only answer coming to my mind was ""No ? Why would I see you if there isn't any reason ?""  I know that would be a great time, I just can't understand why would I do that, why and how people just see each other just because they want to without getting hit by anxiety/fatigue from the social interaction.

We’ve had our share of communication issues, one of them on my profile about chat gpt being an issue with her.

I seem to do most of the emotional lifting and fixing. She will let me sit and sit with nothing resolved. Patient because she’s going through a lot. Turning into self erasing and disrespect.

Latest issue was in my profile, I was left in the dark for a month, no reason or answer. Just removed me from her inner world. She had reached out to someone she was in an arranged intimate situation with years back 2 months ago, kept contact and reached out. Said it was for networking reasons. She explained, asked if it crossed a line, I said no. If it stayed for that simple reason, and you’re not reaching or contacting for other reasons, fine, I trust you.

Fast forward last week. We’re resolving previous issue and she said she was late for coffee. I said ok, do what you gotta do. I don’t know why we started a deep conversation when she had plans but ok.

Said she was meeting Brooke. Sounds good have fun we’ll talk later. She later explains it was a man. Stuck to the story of “he was a work goofball, just needed life advice” ok… I asked if he was from her past. She deflected and avoided context and made him  into something else. With enough push back, it was the guy she was intimate with.

She tried to make it sound like no big deal, I asked why she couldn’t tell me prior? So I can have some understanding, I was in the dark and was promised I wouldn’t be, and you spent over an hour dumping emotions and life stuff to a man you were intimate with and didn’t say anything?

I started to process it and let it be until she gave more context yesterday and told me she lied about the name, I asked why she wasn’t transparent knowing how I understanding I am, she says she didn’t know but regrets it. Can’t tell me why, just keeps saying IDK. And emotional bombing and begging, “were just friends”…

My thing is. Why would someone lie if it was innocent. He told her “let me know if you need anything” and was sending her son a birthday card. I feel she was leaving an open end unintentionally or maybe intentional.

For homesteaders, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone interested in self-reliance, spring is prime time for foraging. The landscape offers a surprising abundance of edible plants that can supplement your pantry with fresh, nutrient-rich foods.

 

Whether you’re looking to add variety to your meals, boost your survival skills, or simply enjoy nature’s bounty, here are 10 of the best wild foods to forage in Northern Michigan and the U.P. this spring—including tips on identification, harvesting, and preparation.

 

1. Cattails (Typha spp.)

Why They’re Great: Known as the “supermarket of the swamp,” cattails provide edible parts nearly year-round.

Where to Find Them: Marshes, wetlands, and pond edges.

What to Eat:

• Spring shoots: Peel and eat raw or sautéed.

• Rhizomes: High in starch; roast or boil.

• Pollen (later in season): Collect for flour.

Tip: Avoid polluted water sources.

 

2. Wild Leeks (Ramps)

Why They’re Great: A spring delicacy with a strong onion-garlic flavor, packed with vitamins.

Where to Find Them: Shaded hardwood forests, often near streams.

What to Eat: Leaves and bulbs.

Harvesting Tip: Take only a few from each patch to ensure sustainability.

Warning: Do not confuse with lily-of-the-valley (toxic).

 

3. Acorns

Why They’re Great: A carbohydrate powerhouse that can be turned into flour for bread or porridge.

Where to Find Them: Under oak trees.

Preparation:

• Shell and crush nuts.

• Leach tannins by soaking in water (change water until clear).

• Dry and grind into meal.

Tip: White oak acorns are less bitter than red oak.

 

4. Wild Berries

Why They’re Great: Sweet, nutrient-rich, and easy to preserve.

Where to Find Them:

• Blackberries and raspberries: Thickets and forest edges.

• Blueberries: Sandy soils and open woods.

Season: Late spring into summer.

Preservation: Dry or make jam if sugar is available.

Warning: Avoid white berries—most are poisonous.

 

5. Fiddleheads

Why They’re Great: Young fern shoots that are rich in antioxidants and vitamins.

Where to Find Them: Moist, shaded areas near streams.

Preparation:

• Only harvest ostrich fern fiddleheads.

• Boil twice, discard water (never eat raw).

Season: Early spring.

 

6. Morel Mushrooms

Why They’re Great: Highly prized for their earthy flavor and culinary versatility.

Where to Find Them: Around dead or dying elms, ash, and poplar trees; recently burned areas.

Season: Mid to late spring.

Tip: Always positively identify—false morels are toxic.

Preservation: Dry for long-term storage.

 

7. Dandelion Greens

Why They’re Great: Common, abundant, and packed with vitamins A and C.

Where to Find Them: Lawns, fields, and roadsides (avoid sprayed areas).

What to Eat: Leaves, flowers, and roots.

Preparation:

• Young leaves for salads.

• Roots roasted for coffee substitute.

Season: Early spring before leaves turn bitter.

 

8. Wild Asparagus

Why They’re Great: Tender shoots that taste like cultivated asparagus.

Where to Find Them: Old fields, roadsides, and fence lines.

Season: Late spring.

Tip: Look for last year’s dried stalks—they mark the spot.

 

9. Sorrel

Why They’re Great: A tangy green that adds flavor and vitamin C to meals.

Where to Find Them: Meadows and open woods.

Preparation: Use fresh in salads or soups.

Season: Early spring.

 

10. Nettles

Why They’re Great: High in iron and protein, nettles are a nutritional powerhouse.

Where to Find Them: Moist, rich soil near streams and forest edges.

Preparation:

• Wear gloves when harvesting.

• Boil or steam to remove sting.

Uses: Soups, teas, or sautéed greens.

Foraging Safety and Best Practices

• Know Your Plants: Use a reliable field guide or take a class. Never guess—mistakes can be fatal.

• Harvest Responsibly: Take only what you need and leave enough for regrowth.

• Avoid Contaminated Areas: Stay clear of roadsides, industrial sites, and sprayed fields.

• Preserve Your Harvest: Dry, pickle, or freeze (if possible) to extend shelf life.

 

Why Spring Foraging Matters

Spring is the season of renewal—and foraging connects you directly to that cycle. After a long winter, these wild foods provide fresh nutrients, variety, and a sense of self-reliance. Whether you’re supplementing your pantry or practicing survival skills, Northern Michigan and the U.P. offer a rich, edible landscape for those who know where to look.

1qw12hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qw12hj/kate_pt4_breakfast/,Kate Pt-4 Breakfast,"0655 – Composers’ Quarters

Kate paused just outside the door, heart steady but quick. She reached out through the neural link she shared with Clara and Cynthia—old tech, intimate, reliable.

Ladies, wish us luck, she sent, tone light but sincere. And Clara, Cynthia… I will not ask him to leave your side for many years. He’s yours too. Always will be.

A soft, warm response came back almost instantly from both.

Thank you, Clara sent, emotion threading the words.

Luck, Cynthia added, dry but fond. And be kind. He’s stubborn, but he’s worth it.

The door slid open with a quiet hiss.

Inside, the room was softly lit—morning simulation , she stops staring at a picture of a Drazzan on fire she chuckled to her self . Wyatt sat in one of the compact sim pods, visor down, body relaxed in the harness. On the low table near the center: a woven basket of juice glasses, fresh fruit, pastries, and a small pile of sweets. No eggs, no ham. Yet.

Kate smiled, warmth blooming in her chest.

“Wyatt,” she called gently.

He powered down the sim, visor lifting. He blinked once—seeing her in civilian clothes, hair loose, no armor, no rank—and rose smoothly from the pod. He crossed the short distance, expression guarded but curious.

Kate gestured to the table. “Shall we sit?”

Wyatt started to lower himself into the chair nearest the viewport.

Kate stopped him with a light touch on his arm. “Excuse me, Baron.”

He froze, frowning slightly—half amused, half wary.

Kate’s eyes sparkled. “Okay. No titles then, Wyatt.”

The corner of his mouth lifted—just a fraction, but enough.

She waited one beat. “Wyatt… a gentleman always helps a lady sit at a table.”

He exhaled through his nose—almost a laugh—and stepped behind her chair. He pulled it out, then pushed it in. A little too far. Her knees bumped the underside of the table.

Kate laughed softly. “Oh, I like a forceful man.” She tilted her head back to look up at him. “However… maybe next time not so far in, please.”

Wyatt caught the word—please—and his mind flashed to yesterday: I always say please when I have intentions.

He didn’t comment. Just stepped around to his own seat, looking faintly flustered.

Kate reached for the juice pitcher. “Let’s have juice and sweets, Wyatt. Though I was hoping for eggs and ham.”

Wyatt paused. “I can order that if you like.”

“Please do.”

He tapped the table comm. “Wyatt to galley.  eggs, ham, toast, jam. Two servings. And coffee—hot, black, strong.”

Kate watched him. “How would you like your eggs?”

“You pick,” she said simply.

He added scrambled to the order, then looked at her across the table. “Can we talk about the fighter?”

“Why yes we can, dear Wyatt.” She leaned forward slightly. “Tell me what you wish to know.”

Wyatt’s gaze sharpened. “Why are you really doing this? What’s in it for you?”

Kate placed her hand lightly on his forearm—not grabbing, just resting. Warm. Steady.

“I see so many questions from you.” She smiled, soft but unflinching. “Like I said—I’m stuck here. At the speeds of your ships, I’ll be an old woman before I ever see Earth again. And Wyatt…” Her voice dropped, honest. “I want to live life. Marry. Have children. Grow old with a man, watching waves hit a beach. That’s what’s in it for me.”

She let the words settle, then turned the question back. “What does Wyatt want out of life?”

He looked down at his hands for a long moment. “Quietly… to serve the Principality. Retire. And maybe get married. Have a family.”

Kate nodded. “Would you like your wife to be the same age as you?”

“Yes.”

She tilted her head. “Well, that doesn’t work for women, Wyatt. A man needs to be reminded—women have a built-in clock. We can’t wait until we’re sixty to have children.”

Wyatt blinked. “I… didn’t think about that.”

“Most men don’t.”

He started to speak—about the fighter again—but Kate reached out, placing one finger gently against his lips.

“Specs later.” She reached into her pocket and slid a small, matte-black data chit across the table. “Pick it up. No strings.”

Wyatt stared at it. Didn’t touch it yet.

A knock at the door.

Wyatt called, “Enter.”

Tammy from the galley stepped in carrying a steaming tray: fluffy scrambled eggs folded around thick slices of ham, golden toast, small pots of jam, and two mugs of rich, dark coffee. The scent filled the room instantly.

Tammy set it down with a quick smile. “Enjoy, sir, ma’am.”

As she left, Kate inhaled deeply. “How did you know this was my favorite?”

Wyatt picked up his fork, a small shrug. “It seems we have something in common.”

They ate in easy quiet for a few minutes. Then Kate set her mug down.

“You said ‘have a family.’ How many children?”

Wyatt didn’t hesitate. “Six to eight.”

Kate’s eyebrows shot up. She laughed—bright, surprised. “Oh my. Shall we start now?”

Wyatt’s fork paused mid-air. “I thought no banter.”

Kate grinned. “Well, you surprised me there with the eight. Don’t you think starting with one first? Not overwhelm a woman?”

Wyatt’s lips twitched. A real smile—small, reluctant, but real. “See? You can smile.”

They finished breakfast slowly. Kate asked about Newtown—how he ran it from orbit, how the brewery fit into village life, how the fishing coordinated. Wyatt relaxed by degrees—shoulders dropping, words coming easier, stories flowing of old Walnut trees and sea turtles 

At one point Clara’s voice brushed Kate’s mind—gentle, checking in.

How’s he doing?

We’re just talking, Kate sent back.

No visitors, Clara replied firmly. You’ve got the room.

Thank you.

Kate looked at Wyatt across the table. “Where’s your room?”

He glanced toward the connecting corridor. “Just down the passage.”

Kate stood, extending her hand. “Let’s see it. You’ve seen mine.”

Wyatt hesitated—then took her hand. Warm. Steady.

“See? I don’t bite,” she teased.

They walked the short distance. His quarters were sparse—functional, clean, almost austere. A neatly made bunk, a small desk, a single shelf with a few models and books. And one framed photo: a woman with red hair, laughing, arms around a younger Wyatt.

Kate picked it up gently. “Is this your mother?”

“Yes.”

Kate smiled, eyes bright. “Red hair. We could have a redheaded little girl.”

Wyatt’s throat worked. He didn’t speak.

Kate swiped the pictures one by one . 

Kate set the photo down carefully, then led him back toward the corridor.

“On Earth,” she said quietly, “women are… shall we say… more aggressive in relationships.”

She leaned in and kissed his cheek—soft, lingering.

“I can be patient,” she murmured. “But remember—I have a clock. And six to eight babies takes time.”

She kissed his other cheek, lighter this time. “I would never force my husband to give up his career.”

And then she said the unexpected Wyatt without a heir , what happens to Newtown. 

Wyatt saying I do not know . 

Wyatt looked down at the data chit still sitting on the table in the composters ’ quarters.

Kate seeing that saying Wyatt pick it up it’s yours . We have had breakfast 

“Dinner tonight?” Kate asked.

He met her eyes. “That sounds… fun.”

Kate’s smile widened. “Not ‘okay.’ Fun.”

Wyatt exhaled a quiet laugh. “Fun.”

“Dinner at?”

“1900 hours.”

“My quarters or yours?”

“Yours is fine.” He paused. “Just… don’t bite.”

Kate’s eyes sparkled. “Is a nibble okay?”

Wyatt’s mouth curved—almost a grin. “We’ll see.”

She squeezed his hand once before letting go.

“1900, Wyatt. Don’t be late.”

He watched her walk away and 

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Kate paused just outside the doorway of Wyatt’s quarters, the data chit now tucked safely in his pocket, the quiet promise of dinner at 1900 still warm between them. She turned back to him, expression calm but practical.

“Wyatt… before I go—can I get an escort? I shouldn’t just be wandering the ship alone. Protocol, right?”

Wyatt nodded without hesitation, already lifting his comm. “I can assign one of the compositors to escort you for the day—any deck, any time you need.”

Kate tilted her head. “That would be nice. Are any of them women?”

“Yes. Raquel Otillo  . She’s one of our best shuttle and fighter pilots. Fact is other than myself Clara will only allow Raquel to pilot her shuttle . She flies the same birds I do—precise, steady, knows every corridor and shortcut on this ship. You’ll like her.” Like  you she’s aggressive he smirks . 

Kate’s smile softened. “Please do. And Wyatt…” She gestured toward the compact simulator alcove built into the bulkhead of his quarters. “Show me these simulators first. Why—” She pointed directly at the distinctive one in the corner: sleek crimson accents, elegant lines, unmistakably vintage-inspired. “This one. 

Wyatt followed her finger. “A gift. To Clara. a Spitfire sim 20th century earth  She’s obsessed with pre-spaceflight Earth aviation—those old propeller fighters from the world wars. That’s a full-motion replica cockpit, authentic flight model down to the stick feel and engine roar. She uses it when she needs to clear her head. Or just… fly away for a while.”

Kate traced the edge of the pod with her fingertips. “Beautiful. Tell her I’m officially jealous.”

Wyatt tapped his comm. “Wyatt to Raquel. Report to my quarters, please. Escort detail for Lt. Hill today.”

A crisp, familiar voice answered almost immediately. “On my way, sir. Two minutes.”

While they waited, Kate stepped closer to Wyatt, voice low and warm. “Thank you. For breakfast. For the talk. For… letting me in a little.”

Wyatt met her gaze. “I’m not running. Just… figuring out the vectors.”

The door chimed. Raquel stepped through, dark-haired,bronze skin lean in the way pilots often are, wearing a standard flight suit . Pilot wings glinted on her chest, and her posture carried the easy confidence of someone who spent more time in cockpits than on parade grounds. She came to a relaxed attention, then gave Wyatt a quick nod.

“Lt. Hill—Kate—this is Raquel Otillo .  Raquel, Kate Hill. She’s under your escort today. Full deck access, your discretion.”

Raquel extended her hand. “Kate. Pleasure. I’ve heard good things.”

Kate shook firmly. “Raquel. Thanks for this. I know it’s not exactly a glamorous assignment.”

Raquel’s mouth curved. “Beats another six-hour sim drill. I’m with you until relieved.”

Wyatt gave Kate one last look—quiet, steady. “1900. I’ll be there.”

Kate smiled. “Don’t be late, Wyatt.”

He exhaled a soft laugh. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

Wyatt stepped aside as the door closed behind him, heading toward the bridge.

Kate turned to Raquel. “Shall we walk? I could use some air—even if it’s recycled.”

They started down the corridor, stride matching stride. After a few paces, Kate glanced sideways.

“Raquel… you’ve flown with Wyatt a while?”

“Three years now. Same squadron rotations, same shuttle runs. He’s one of the best stick- guys I’ve ever seen—calm in the seat, always sees the angle before anyone else. Saved my bird more than once .  Pulled me out with seconds to spare. I owe him.”

Kate nodded slowly.  “And your intentions with him?”

Raquel didn’t flinch or look away. “Honest? Early on, yeah—I noticed him. He’s solid, good-looking, doesn’t play games. But he never looked twice. Never gave anyone the wrong signal. I got the hint. He’s like a brother now. Part of the cockpit family. I’d fly cover for him any day, any fight. That’s where it ends.”

Kate studied her for a long beat, then spoke plainly. “I’m interested in him. More than interested. But I would never force him to leave any of you—not Clara, not Cynthia, not the pilots he flies with. He belongs here. I’m just hoping there’s room for one more in the formation.” At least time to time as he wants 6-8 babies 

Raquel stopped walking “ what” . Looked at Kate—really looked 6-8 

You better get started what are you 22-23 

Kate awake time yes . From birth time 44 earth years : Cindy 45 

Raquel so Kate you did stasis runs . 

Yes I was in route when an issue happened with my slip drive . 

Raquel looking at Kate so you can’t go home.

Then she stepped forward and wrapped Kate in a quick, strong hug—brief, fierce, the kind pilots give when words aren’t enough.

“Thank you for saying that,” Raquel said as she pulled back. “He deserves someone who sees the whole picture—who doesn’t try to pull him away from the people who’ve got his six. If that’s you… then you’ve got mine too.”

Kate returned the hug for a heartbeat before letting go, eyes bright. “Deal. Now—show me the observation deck? I want to see the void  from up here. And maybe you can tell me which beaches are best for heelers.”on his Newtown . I’ll assume you have been there . 

Raquel grinned , you will love it , open, genuine. “There’s a cove north of Newtown. Perfect sand, gentle surf.  Best place to run.” Been there 5 times now , I have two friends there . 

Kate laughed softly . “Lead the way, Raquel.”

They walked on—two women, one temporary escort detail, one shared understanding: Wyatt Staples-Hill was worth protecting. And Kate Hill intended to do exactly that—for as many years as the stars allowed.",4,1770239386.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

2. I made a sour jar with things i mentioned above and put his name into it.

I also wrote his name and put it in a boiling water which had chilli flakes infused in it.

So far he suddenly changed his phone number although I had already blocked him but I got to know about it via my friends. I don't know if it had anything to do with my spells.

and the eyes… oh god the eyes… they’re huge and round like marshmallows. if u cut him up (not rlly do it pls) he’d prob taste like… sweet potatoes? or maybe maple syrup idk. also the map… the world is kinda like a fridge… like all the places he goes… are just compartments for him to chill in.
theres that part with the sun and the lamp… lamp = oven. sun =… microwave? anyway it’s like the game is lowkey a cooking simulator. the cat in the dark… probs just a garnish.
also why does everyone want him safe… coz… edible things are fragile ok?? u don’t just eat a raw shining boy without feelings… they melt. like candy.

1qw0x6e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw0x6e,"One pair of ""mustaches"" = one struck target. We help drone pilots and help destroy the enemy for the price of a cup of coffee. Join us — it’s probably the cheapest way to support the AFU! )))","Currently, we at the B50 Frontier volunteer community are manufacturing what is known as ""**mustaches**."" This product, one such ""pair,"" is what determines whether a drone will explode upon contact with the target. If you have seen videos from drone pilots where they strike targets — these are the two rods visible at the edge of the video ))))

There is a constant need for such components for drones at the front, and that’s a good thing, because it means the drones are hitting their targets a lot. The guys in field workshops are often forced to twist these contacts by hand from whatever is at hand. This is not just difficult; it’s dangerous. If a contact is faulty, the drone might either fail to explode at the crucial moment or, even worse, detonate right during launch in the pilot's hands.

Our volunteers have taken this upon themselves: we do the modeling, print the bases on 3D printers, assemble, and solder the finished kits ourselves. At the end of last year, we already delivered over 500 pairs, including to the OPFOR unit, which we have been helping for a long time.

The math here is very simple. Manufacturing one pair of such ""mustaches"" costs approximately 55 UAH (1€/1,2$). This is less than a cup of coffee, but it means = 1 guaranteed struck target and the safety of our pilot. We produce exactly as many as the donations allow, and the requests from the military are always ""we need a lot."" All funds go toward printing plastic, springs, and fasteners.

If you have the opportunity to support our production, you can do so via PayPal: [frontier@b50.com.ua](mailto:frontier@b50.com.ua).

1qw0vms,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/1qw0vms/really_need_advice_bad_sa_results_theyre/,Really need advice. Bad SA results. They’re suggesting IVF.,"I don’t make full on posts on here. I’m more of a daily chat girl. But I really need some advice. 

My husband and I havnt been trying for that long. Only 4 months. But my gyno sent us to a fertility specialist because I have large fibroids on the OUTSIDE of my uterus. She said they shouldn’t impact fertility but that I should try to get pregnant before they get too big and need to be removed with surgery. She wants me to try and avoid surgery until I’m done having children. That’s why she referred me to fertility.

I still need to get my HSG soon but my blood results came back all optimal. I am 33 with plenty of eggs and good levels on everything else. 

My husband just got his SA results back and they were devastating. 

Count 34 million (normal is above 18 mil)

Motility 18% (normal is greater than 35%)

Volume 2.30 mls (normal is greater than 1.2 mls)

Morphology 0% (ideally greater than 4%)

The clinic messaged me saying that they recommend I AT LEAST do IUI. I was like of coarse we want to do IUI right away then. Then they messaged me again saying that they misspoke and actually IUI would have a very low success rate because there will be a small number of sperm left over after they wash it. And that they actually suggest IVF for our case.

Of coarse this scared my husband into action. He’s immediately cleaning up his life. No more alcohol or coffee and he’s going to start exercising. He’s at the most unhealthiest he’s ever been in his life. 34 years old btw. The results shocked him more than it did for me because I knew even beforehand that he needed to change his lifestyle and I also knew he was going to go on thinking he’s perfect until he sees data.

So we have husband on board for a full lifestyle change but I’m here for advice on what to do.

IVF is so expensive and this would be something that we need to save up for over time. We wouldn’t be able to do this right away. Would it be wise to do IUI while we save up for IVF or is it pointless? Will his improved lifestyle help?

I’m so devastated I took the day off because I felt like I was about to faint. Do I need to just go ahead and remove my fibroids while saving up for IVF? My doctor wants me to get pregnant before cutting into me. 

Any advice is welcome and please be nice I’m in a tough place mentally today.",4,1770238979.0,TryingForABaby,18,1.0,False

I kept running into the same problem: I’d find places I loved, forget why they stood out, or lose them in messy map lists and notes. There was also no real social aspect — no easy way to meet up for a coffee or see what others were enjoying.

So I made something focused on saving cafés by vibe and personal impressions — not just ratings — and connecting them to coffee origins (farms they come from) and other people who care about café culture.

In my head, it’s a bit like “Strava for people who love discovering cafés and treating coffee breaks as part of their day”, with a way to connect with others who share similar interests.

Before I take it further, I’d really appreciate honest feedback.

1qw0sjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicEXE/comments/1qw0sjk/sonicexe_dangered_souls/,Sonic.exe Dangered Souls,"I just had a shower thought about a Sonic asym game concept that had like survivors and people that are in danger and thought that I would post a concept around that.

Here's where my inspiration comes from

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicEXEOutcomeMemory/comments/1qtsa2l/comment/o38sw72/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicEXEOutcomeMemory/comments/1qtsa2l/comment/o38sw72/?context=3)

So here's how it works

There's gonna be 3 killers at launch

Kolossos - Possessed Modern Sonic

Superstars Sonic.exe - Possessed Classic Sonic

curse\_DOLL - Possessed Tails Doll

curse\_DOLL concept and moveset

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutcomeMemories/comments/1qua6sf/replacement\_tails\_doll\_exe\_concept/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutcomeMemories/comments/1qua6sf/replacement_tails_doll_exe_concept/)

Kolossos is gonna be a beeg slow hitter.

Sstars Sonic.exe is gonna be a small fast hitter

curse is gonna be a trapper

Kolossos moveset

Attack

Kolossos will swipe his claw hand, doing 20 damage/10 dodge meter to a survivor, staggering them when doing so, and then slash with his spike arm, doing 30 damage/15 dodge meter to a survivor.

Rush

Kolossos will charge forward with his spike arm reached out. He can turn when he's charging, although it'll be like trying to drift with a car that has 0 points in handling while on ice in a racing game. It'll do 30 damage/15 dodge meter to the first survivor that gets caught and do 15 damage/7.5 dodge meter to any other survivors that gets caught as well. The charge will last for 8 seconds or until Kolossos hits a wall.

Dropkick

Kolossos will stab the ground with his spike arm, then launch himself forward to do a dropkick. The ground stab will make a shockwave. If a survivor gets hit directly by the spike arm, it'll do 25 damage/12.5 dodge meter and burry them. If any survivors get hit by the shockwave, it'll do 5 damage/2.5 dodge meter and it'll push the survivors that take the 5 damage and not push the survivors that takes 2.5 dodge meter. The dropkick itself will do 28 damage/14 dodge meter and it'll launch the survivor that takes 28 damage super far and not launch the survivor that dodges. If Kolossos misses the dropkick, he will fall face flat on the ground and he'll take 2 seconds to get back up. You can also aim where you want to dropkick to.

Indicator

Kolossos' pupils will glow a bright red for 6 seconds. During that time, Kolossos can see where everyone is. When he's indicating, all his moves will be locked until the 6 seconds are up.

Superstars Sonic.exe (Sstars Sonic.exe)

This is this game's version of the small Sonic.exe from TD. He takes the form of Classic Sonic from Sonic Superstars because Kolossos already took the form of Modern Sonic. Though this game's Sonic is still alive and himself. The reason why I chose Superstars Sonic was because of the chaos emerald powers could make an interesting moveset for a Sonic.exe. He can't make clones without the blue chaos emerald and he can't disguise himself as anyone.

Passive:

Jumpball

When Sonic.exe jumps, he'll curl up into a ball. It'll do 5 damage/2.5 dodge points and pushes survivors away.

Attack

Sonic.exe will raise his hand, getting a slight speed boost, then lunges forward when he swipes. It'll do 10 damage/5 dodge meter and will cause a bleed status for 5 seconds. When a survivor is bleeding, they'll be slowed down, take 1 damage per second they have it, and cannot be attacked until the bleeding ends.

Dropdash

Sonic.exe will jump in the air, then perform a dropdash. The initial jump will do the same thing as his passive. The dropdash will act exactly like Sonic's dropdash from OM except that for the 3rd and final hit, Sonic.exe will stop spinning and will jump up and do an axe kick on the survivor that he hit. The first two hits will do 5 damage/2.5 dodge meter and the final hit will do 10 damage/5 dodge meter and ragdoll the survivor.

Emerald Power

Sonic.exe will pull out a Chaos Emerald and he'll raise it high up. Depending on what Chaos Emerald he has equipped will result in a different move.

Red: Sonic.exe will turn into a fireball that will inflict burn damage on survivors

Blue: Sonic.exe will generate 3 clones that will make survivors hallucinate. They can be killed by a ranged attack.

Green: Sonic.exe will whip out a vine that can latch onto survivors and pull them towards him fast. He can be stunned out of this by another survivor.

Yellow: Sonic.exe will slow down survivors that are in the highlighted circle around him when he has the yellow chaos emerald equipped.

Purple: Sonic.exe's pupils will glow a bright purple as he will be able to see where everyone is. He'll gain a minor speed boost and will still be able to use his moves when indicating.

Cyan: Sonic.exe will transform into a blob of water that creates a trail of water that slows down the survivors and make them slippery.

White: Sonic.exe will jump in the air and a random button will appear on your screen. If you press the correct button, Sonic.exe will homing attack on the closest survivor. You can homing attack a survivor 3 times with a quick time event after you land each attack. It'll do 10 damage each/5 dodge meter.

Survivors can stop him from using the ability by stunning him when he's pulling out and raising the Chaos Emerald.

Swap

Sonic.exe will switch which emerald he'll use when he uses the Emerald Power ability. He'll swap between Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, Cyan, and Purple.

The Survivors goals is to save the character they're assigned to and escape with them.

The survivors and who they're supposed to save are:

Tails - Save Sonic

Honey - Save Amy

Vanilla and Chocola - Save Cream

Ray - Save Mighty

Eggman - Save Metal Sonic

Blaze - Save Silver

Rouge - Save Shadow

Kit - Save Surge

Whisper - Save Tangle

Nicole - Save Sally

There's a few unique things about this game

1. If you die while having the character you're supposed to save, instead of spectating, you'll swap to that character who only has 10 HP and a dodge meter of 100.
2. There's no minions in this game. If you die, you die.
3. There's gonna be 2 maps that are gonna be played at the same time. Half of the server is gonna be in 1 map while the other is gonna be in the other map. There's gonna be a ring in the 2 maps that lets you go to the other map that's being played.

I'ma explain how the saving mechanic works. There's gonna be clues around the map that you spawn in that will give you hints on where the item related to the character you're supposed to save is. Once you get the item, You can use it to help you save the character you're supposed to save in the other map. There's also gonna be clues in the other map that'll give hints on where the character is. 

Vanilla and Chocola

Item needed: Cheese

Moves:

Chao Pirouette

Vanilla will spin with one leg while the other is stretched out, making it a multi-hit stun. Chocola will spin around Vanilla, acting like a shield that blocks attacks and reflects ranged attacks once. Vanilla will get a speed boost from spinning and will be spinning for 5 seconds before stopping or until Chocola blocks an attack. If Vanilla ate chocolate, then Chocola can block 2 attacks. If she has Cheese, then Cheese and Chocola will spin around Vanilla, blocking/reflecting 2 attacks. If Vanilla ate chocolate, then Chocola and Cheese can block 4 attacks.

Snack time!

Vanilla will bring out a random food or drink and depending on what it is will make it heal a different amount of HP and maybe give a little bonus.

Cookie

Vanilla will bring out a cookie and will eat it, healing 35 HP. This can also heal nearby survivors

Coffee

Vanilla will bring out a glass of coffee and will drink it, healing 15 HP and doubling her speed for 3 seconds. This can also do the same effects to nearby survivors

Chocolate

Vanilla will bring out a bar of chocolate, split it between herself and Chocola, healing 18 HP while making her next chao move stronger. If she has Cheese, then she will also split it with him, healing 12 HP and making her next chao move stronger. This can heal nearby survivors.

Intimidate

Vanilla will give an intimidating glare to the exe, slowing them down and locking their moves for 5 seconds.

Chao Attack

Vanilla will signal chocola to attack the exe, stunning him for 3 seconds and push them back. If Vanilla ate chocolate, then Chocola will do a chao tornado, attacking the exe multiple times before launching them away in an arc. If Vanilla has Cheese, then Cheese can attack the exe as well, stunning him for an additional second. If Vanilla ate Chocolate, then Chocola will do a chao tornado as Cheese places an Omachao bomb at where the exe is gonna land at. 

Once Cream is saved, Cheese will return to Cream, leaving Vanilla with only Chocola again.",1,1770238799.0,SonicEXE,0,1.0,False
1qw0qwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1qw0qwj/update_on_nanny_leaving/,Update on nanny leaving,"I called the company first thing Monday morning before my nanny got to the house. I told them what happened. They were just completely shocked. They wanted to know if I spoke to her about it yet and I told them I would be in a little bit. 

I had taken the day off work to be present when my husband who is working from home have this discussion. 

We found out:
- She doesn't like the cats. We told her before we even scheduled an interview we have cats. We told her their personalities and true to our word, one wants attention and likes to sit with her and baby. The other hides. She doesnt like the fur on her clothes. I have lint rollers in every room (very fluffy cats) and we even offered to buy her basic stuff to keep here if fur bothered her before she started. Sorry we vacuum every other day and still have fur in the house. Note we have friends who are allergic to cats and they say they never have issues unless they pet the cats. 

-She thinks its gross how much my baby can puke when her gastroparesis acts up. We agree its why we offered to buy clothes and since she lives in apartment told her she can bring her laundry and do it while she watches baby. There have been two days baby puked like whole bottles up on her. 

-She is upset my husband didnt help clean up the puke and poop that was everywhere one day when she blew out her diaper. He was working. He came out twice when she was really inconsolable and he tried but then had a meeting. When her tummy gets upsets its just all chaos. 

- She was upset my husband didnt make her coffee when he makes himself coffee. We told her its there to help herself and if there are any creamers etc she likes we would be happy to stock it. 

- She wanted to use formula and not breast milk as she thinks my preemie baby needs preemie formula for nutrients. (We already tried it and it made her tummy worse and caused her to break out hives. GI and pediatrician are very happy with her growth on breastmilk)

I've been through this myself twice before, so I thought I'd share 11 things that helped me get through that period.

1) Keep your CV fresh and always be looking. Not every day, but maybe once a month or so, send out a few applications for jobs you think are good. I was too comfortable in my job where I stayed for over 8 years, and that's what hurt me when the moment came.

2) When they bring you into that HR meeting, don't sign any papers on the spot. Your head will be spinning, and you won't be able to process what they're saying about your severance and benefits. All I did was take some notes and tell them I'd review the papers and get back to them in a day or two. You need to fully understand what you're agreeing to.

3) Try not to take your anger out on your manager. Most of the time, the decision comes from people much higher up than them, and they are just carrying out orders. They probably feel bad too. Blowing up at them or sending an angry email won't do you any good. I got two jobs later on because my old managers gave me very good recommendations.

4) The first thing you should do is go home and completely disconnect. Take a long walk, play some video games, anything to help you clear your head. Give yourself that day. The planning can start tomorrow.

5) The very next day, sit down and make a real budget. The severance money will feel like a lot, but it gets spent very quickly. Apply for unemployment benefits immediately if available. Figure out your essential expenses that you can't do without (like rent, food, and insurance) and what you can cut back on (like streaming platform subscriptions and eating out). I called my car insurance company and lowered my monthly premium. I switched to their cheapest internet plan. For household expenses, I started going to cheaper supermarkets and began cooking everything myself. Just by stopping my daily coffee runs and weekend outings, I saved about $20 a week. It all adds up in the end.

6) Don't keep it a secret. The first time it happened to me, I was very ashamed and didn't tell anyone. Now I talk about it openly. Layoffs happen. You never know who in your network might find you an opportunity. Some friends might act weird, but your true friends will stick by you and support you. Also, seriously consider taking a break from social media like Instagram. Seeing people post pictures of their outings, dinners, and travels while you're in this situation can be very hard on your mental health.

7) Your family will be another story. My parents meant well, of course, but I had to set some simple boundaries. They would send me every job ad they saw, even if it was completely unsuitable for me, and they would keep asking, 'So, has anyone gotten back to you?'. It's stressful. I learned to tell them, 'Thanks, everyone, I'm on top of it and have my own plan.' But to be fair, they also helped me a lot; they would invite me over for meals and stood by me.

8) Don't be afraid to take a step back if you have to. At one point, I had to accept a job with a lower salary and weaker benefits than my old one. But that was after being unemployed for about 15 months and my savings were running out. That job paid my bills and allowed me to start saving again. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get by.

9) Find something useful to do. I started volunteering at a food bank and took a few free online courses to improve my Excel skills. This got me out of the house and made me feel like I was doing something meaningful. Treat your job search like a full-time job, but at the same time, you need to schedule other things that build your character and strengthen you.

10) Network for real. I don't mean just spamming everyone on LinkedIn. I mean calling up old colleagues you have a good relationship with, letting them know your situation, and asking if they've heard of anything. A phone call or a quick coffee meeting can make a big difference. Most of the best opportunities I got came from people I knew personally.

11) Finally, remember that this situation is temporary, not permanent. It might feel all-consuming right now, but believe me, it will pass. I discovered I could endure much more than I ever imagined. Sure, there were nights I spent worried and staring at the ceiling. But in the end, it passes. Your life might look a little different afterward, but you'll be okay.

Okay so I’m not sure if I should be posting here or on some legal subreddit account because

1.	⁠I’m a noob 2. The thought to post here before asking ChatGBT fueled me

Two years ago I worked for a really well known solar company, the pay was mid the hours were long but the crew was awesome.

My Boss &team mates would always get together for group outings and we all really became well acquainted and supportive of each other.

My Boss, let’s call him Joe, would casually take us on lunch breaks. There were moments were I knew he’d make me uncomfortable just by his presence, it was like out of respect you’d entertain his conversation but honestly I’d rather work and keep to myself. He would call me after our morning meeting calls to chat one on one and sometimes after work hours he’d text me.

I know now looking back I should have made my boundaries clear but I figured he was like this with everyone ( for instance and had one of our lead sales guy help him move to his new place) all buddy buddy vibes…. Anywho

To sum it up he took me to lunch one day- just us. This time was a bit more personal, he was opening up to me about his life, taking me how he sees himself in me.

At this point it started pouring, he was going to drop me off back at the store that I was assigned to that day but stated I had already made my sales goal and that I can always hang and finish the workbooks assignments we all were assigned to do in his car and finish my coffee.

I was ofc down for that instead of going back into that cold store, like a paid length lunch? I’ll take it

Bad idea

We drove around and he kept talking .I was like well I can’t get any work done here drop me off I’d rather finish my shift

Mind you, we are in a pretty woodsy area and just so happens to be close to his new place.

He knew were we were going, I was just face to my work iPad and mindlessly entertaining his rambling.

We says “hey my house is like 2mins away do you want to see the progress that me and coworker did!? I can show you the axe throwing set up I have in my yard!”

Axe throwing was a big part of our company outings… so I agreed.

So I can spear you some time… he forced me into doing things I didn’t want to do I got dropped off to my car and shamly kept that to myself untill the crazy stalking and messaging happened.

I’ll post a few for you to have an idea of

Finally I spoke up about a year ago

I left the job

HR has a whole report with not just me but two other girls, one of the girls he ended up having her move in “to help her get on her feet”- that was his whole act- Mr Save them all

I went to my local country store the other day and who did I bump into? You guessed it. He had the audacity to start walking to my car but I drove off in panic. So now here I am. Still traumatized- in therapy and honestly very upset that nothing came from this. No justice.  Knowing that this man lives only 30min from me is horrifying.

Any advice I can do to see some justice?

Is it too late for a restraining order?

1qw0ltp,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1qw0ltp/2_months_on_keto_heres_what_it_has_and_has_not/,2 months on keto - here’s what it has and has not helped so far,"Just felt like writing this to document my progress. I am trying keto to see if it helps my autoimmune disease (Sjogren’s Syndrome). Main symptoms are fatigue, dry mouth, neuropathy. I am doing a version of keto that is mostly unprocessed whole foods, although I do have cheese and A2 yogurt sometimes. A typical day of includes coffee or tea, eggs, avocados, cauliflower, mushrooms, nuts, chicken/beef/salmon, handful of berries.

What has definitely improved:

 

Fatigue - This is the most dramatic change. Probably a 60+% reduction. Some days I feel relatively normal as far as energy levels, although I have had random flareups even on keto.

Sleep - I have had trouble sleeping my whole life, but I surprisingly sleep longer while in ketosis. Sleep was worse during the first 2/3 weeks but quickly improved after that.

What has possibly improved (hard to say): 

Dry mouth - I think that my daytime dry mouth/throat has been slightly better, but symptoms seem to be just as bad overnight. I wake up with a sore throat.

Mood - It’s funny because I know the increased energy and sleep should make a huge impact on my mood, but it is pretty minor. In fact, I sometimes feel super irritable on keto. I’ll still consider it a slight improvement because at least I have the energy to feel emotions now.

Anxiety - I have generally not noticed as much anxiety, but it’s hard to say as my anxiety tends to come and go anyways. It is certainly still possible for me to feel anxiety on keto.

Neuropathy - Still comes and goes, but I think the frequency is decreasing veeery slowly. Neuropathy seems to be a tough one to figure out for a lot of people. Overall I think it’s better on keto than off keto. 

Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain - Has not fully disappeared but hasn’t felt as bad these last two months. 

What has not improved:

Eczema - Same as usual. Flares up in cold or dry weather.

Weight - I am too skinny and would love to gain weight, but I find it so difficult on keto. I realize this is a good thing for many of you who do keto for weight loss.

Focus - I’ve heard many people find that keto helps their focus/motivation, but I have not experienced that.

Libido - Still low even when I have more energy. 

I want to stay in ketosis, but I do kinda feel like a lot of the improvements have plateaued and am considering trying either Keto AIP (Autoimmune Protocol Diet) or carnivore. I am especially worried that the nuts, eggs, and dairy I’m eating might not be helping. I’d love to hear about other people’s experiences with those diets. Or with just keto alone or course.

I kept running into the same problem: I’d find places I loved, forget why they stood out, or lose them in messy map lists and notes. There was also no real social aspect — no easy way to meet up for a coffee or see what others were enjoying.

So I made something focused on saving cafés by vibe and personal impressions — not just ratings — and connecting them to coffee origins (farms they come from) and other people who care about café culture.

In my head, it’s a bit like “Strava for people who love discovering cafés and treating coffee breaks as part of their day”, with a way to connect with others who share similar interests.

Before I take it further, I’d really appreciate honest feedback.

Apparently “boiled” coffee is bad. These researchers prepped the coffee by boiling it in a pot for 3 minutes. In reality we turn the heat off the second it reaches a boil.

We went pretty deep on this one so you might need a good cup of coffee.

A few things stood out going through the numbers.

1. NE QB #10 is a runner, his yards aren't scrambles. He's NE #3 ball carrier by touches and yards.

2. NE O-Line is 2nd in the league at +20yd passes but this doesn't translate to +40yd catches. Watch this zone, they are 2nd only to LAR in this. (They had 2x vs DEN to #13 over +20yds.)

3. NE O-Line gets +20yd runs at a similar rate to SEA O-Line but they NE also gets alot of +40yd carries whereas Hawks fall back on this yardage.

4. SEA O-Line gets the most +40yd passes in the league, watch for explosive plays via the air.

5. NE D-Line hasn't let in a RushTD in the post season, SEA O-Line ground yards are going to be well earned for sure.

6. SEA O-Line has been way more efficient in the post season in the redzone than regular season (72% vs mid-50's).

Mine has changed a lot in the past 12 months. I used to live very fast and organized life. But wow how tables have turned. Even if I had some freelance things to do to get me going before I land something good, I noticed a lot of changes.

I mostly spend time on my laptop obviously and at home to avoid spending the very limited amount of money I have. I basically cut all my unnecessary expenses and only pay for the most affordable gym membership I could find to keep my sanity - or anything that’s left of it.

I realized that I don’t see people anymore because I can’t afford being in their company (brunches, lunches, drinks, pubs etc). My closest friends aren’t really here anyways so we keep in touch through phone. I see some random people in the gym or when I grab a coffee in some of the local shops but that’s like once or twice a week when I allow myself to buy coffee outside and very shallo, mostly meaningless conversation. The good thing I realized how unimportant we really are to 99% of people we ever knew - unless I post something on social media, 9.9 out of 10 people I know won’t ever check if I’m alive. It includes some I thought cared (even the latest person I was seeing when my financial crisis peaked) so that sucks - but still good because it’s pretty much eye opening. It’s like when people know you are struggling they don’t feel like reaching out to you that much even if you were/are somewhat connected professionally or privately. They will like your social media post but won’t say hi how’s it going… lol. Terrible and soul crushing but eye opening.

Also, I noticed how time flies much faster. Sometimes I can’t even tell it’s another Friday and then get depressed because I know it’s going to be another weekend when no one will reply to emails, messages or applications even if I try sending them.

It feels like my life has been on a major pause for a year. Very lonely and silent times but also pretty eye opening for many things, including myself and my own choices and mistakes I made along the way. Gym and swimming keep me sane to some degree. 😁

So basically he thinks I’m entitled to ""special treatment"" and I act like a child, but I don’t think that’s the case.

So very early on in the relationship, he has asked me if I own any property or my parents own any property, like when we were only dating for 1 month ish. And he has told me he wants to buy a house for his dad, and tried to do drop shipping so his dad can leave it to him. I didn’t think it was weird that he asked if I have but now he thinks mine is his, and probably wants me to chip in.

Very early on, he has urged me to find better jobs and save with him, even if I am going on a snowboarding trip with my friends with my own money, he’s upset about it. I budget my money it’s not like I spend it all on things, I save my paycheck and I live below my means. Sometimes I treat him as well, I take him out on dinners, give him something for his birthday. But he still thinks I’m entitled, because there were a few times I asked him to come see me, and asked him if he can pay for things. Like movie tickets. But even when we go shopping or something, he offers to buy me clothes, I’m like it’s okay, it’s not like I need it. And we went on one trip together, we split the bills. And I know he cares about money, so I paid the breakfast, hotels, and other scenery tickets. Like the ratio would be 6/4. He only paid for some food.

And he one day just blow up at me and thinks I control his money… and argued with me that I should treat him with full acceptance without asking anything for return. But I told him this is the type of love that mothers give you, but I am your partner. Maybe because I asked him to post me on social media but I do the same too, because I am proud of having him. And I also told him I’m not comfortable with him having other women’s photos in his phone especially it’s his hookups. He thinks I crossed the line. But it’s not like this isn’t reasonable no¿

He has a problem with me for drinking coffee outside. I like exploring new coffee places once in a while. He would ask me why not study at home. I’m like because it’s boring and I need some fresh air once in a while. He also has a problem with how I interact with my friends, so he has seen one of my best friends. We are very close. So she treats me sometimes, and I also treat her. But he only thinks I am the one getting all the help from them. When that’s not the case.

Then when we broke up he told me he thinks I’m entitled and that I am someone who thinks I deserve something. And I’m like I’m confused, I also treat you no¿ it seems like you’re the one that has a problem with me. When all my friends are fine, I don’t know what I did wrong. He said nothing. Then why do you have a problem with me and thinks I should give you full unconditional love, and if I don’t give you unconditional love I am entitled ¿ he also jokes about that ""you don’t even have a car alright "" and I tell him I don’t need one. I use the subway I rely on my legs, it’s alright to me. He also jokes that I live in a room with my other friend, so I share an apartment with my friend.

1qw08qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1qw08qk/anyone_tried_an_rp_survival_style_playthrough/,"Anyone tried an RP, survival style playthrough?","I came up with some rules that have made my newest playthrough very immersive and fun.

1. Walk everywhere - unless sprinting would make sense like running from the cops, dashing across the street after curfew, going for a morning jog. You can also of course skateboard and drive a car to get around faster. 

2. Eat 2-3 meals per day - for gas station snacks, just buy and discard it in your inventory to ""eat"" it. For restaurants, go to the location and smoke a joint (this takes a few minutes of in game time and you're essentially giving up around $30 worth of product which can simulate paying for the meal)

3. Sleep like a normal person - try to be in bed by 12 most nights. You can stay up later occasionally if the situation calls for it or if you're taking some kind of stimulant (energy drink, meth, cocaine)

4. Generally behave like a human - take time to yourself occasionally. Go for a walk along the water, sit and watch the sunset, shoot some hoops, hit the casino, play video games, get a tattoo or a haircut or a new outfit. Don't just eat the same thing every meal.Take the time to open and close doors, turn off lights, just try to be a human. There are a ton of options. It all adds to the immersion. 

5. Reasonable carry weight - for heavy or bulky items like soil and grow tents, you can carry up to 5 at a time. For furniture pieces like workbench, storage racks, etc, you can only carry one at a time. Of course, buying a car means you can use the trunk.

6. You paid for a week so stay a week. You have to leave the motel by noon on Monday in the 2nd week, you can't take anything with you that was already there, you can't ever go back inside the room - not even to hide from cops. 

7. You can only buy one property per week

8. You need a human living space for you and any employees. This means beds, tv, coffee table, etc with a reasonable amount of open space - no shoving 10 beds in a corner. A worker barracks is fine but each person needs a bed and there needs to be a small break/dining area. 

9. Make friends - choose a few NPCs to be friends with. Walk around with them from time to time, smoke a J with them after completing a deal, prioritize their texts above others and accept the deal for the soonest possible time slot (Jesse has had me sneaking out after curfew a few times)

10. You die or get arrested? Game over. 

These are the rules I have been following and it has been a blast so far. Has anyone else tried anything similar? Any ideas for additional rules that I missed? There is a lot of RP potential in this game and I hope some of that gets expanded upon as development continues. An optional survival mode ala Skyrim would be incredible.

1qw05g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitsapHomesAndLiving/comments/1qw05g2/manette_spotlight/,Manette Spotlight!,"Today’s neighborhood spotlight: Manette (Bremerton).

Manette has personality. You feel it right away.

It’s one of those parts of Kitsap where you can actually do the “I’m just going to take a quick walk” thing and accidentally end up somewhere you didn’t plan on being- possibly because you ran into your neighbors and they were going to walk down the street for a drink.  Is your whole evening sidelined now? Maybe so! Or coffee stop. A little shop you’ve driven past 50 times but never noticed entirely until you were on foot.

The neighborhood itself is a mix of older homes, updated homes, and homes that are still in their original era unapologetically. Some large trees. Hills. Random staircases.

And then there’s the food.

Manette is sneaky good for restaurants. Like, you’re not expecting to have a strong opinion about where to eat in a neighborhood this small… and then suddenly you do. There are places you can walk to for a real meal, not just “grab a sandwich and leave.”

Also, if you’re a soup person, this is your moment. There are certain days in Kitsap where the weather basically demands noodles, and Manette understands that.

The other thing people love is the location. You’re close to downtown Bremerton, close to the water, close to parks, close to ferry access, but you don’t feel like you’re living in the middle of the busiest part of anything. It’s connected without being chaotic.

Manette is one of those neighborhoods that makes you want to be out in it. Walking. Eating. Sitting somewhere with a view. Doing the very Kitsap hobby of staring at water and pretending you’re not thinking about anything.

If you live in Manette (or spend time there), what’s your go-to spot? Coffee? Dinner? Park? Or are you a “walk the bridge and call it exercise” person?",1,1770237402.0,KitsapHomesAndLiving,0,1.0,False

Last Pick: **Luka Doncic to record a Triple Double❌0.5U**

Today's Pick: **De'Aaron Fox 3+ Threes**

**$DKNG**: **+217**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 2.17U

League: Oklahoma City Thunder vs San Antonio Spurs (8:30PM CST on ESPN)

**Recap**: Worth a shot! I thought this would be a blowout but I thought Luka would be the guy to blow out the Nets, guess not! End up losing a 10-legged chalky lay too because Luka came 5 PAR short (did not play in the 4th qtr).

My other POTD considerations was **Myles Turner 3+ Threes** (+125)❌ which was a bad beat and that would have definitely made me not want to post today's POTD (lol). He had 2 three pointers in the 1st half outta 3 three pointer attempts and he did not even shoot a three pointer in the 2nd half (Score Bet accidently paid me out tho)! Man.. give me a chance at least! Not even one three pointer attempt! The other POTD consideration was **Donovan Clingan 13+ Rebs** (+130)✅ He had 11 Rebounds at halftime!

**Matchup:** Not as lucrative odds as yesterday's POTD, but still a nice 2-1 odds here on De'Aaron Fox 3+ Threes. **I'm going to take a chance against a team that gives up the 3rd most threes in the league which is the Thunder**. Fox has also hit 3+ Threes against the Thunder 6 outta his last 11 matchups. He's been zig zagging his 3+ Threes against them. He's been alternating this line in his last 10 matchups and Fox came short from hitting this line on his last matchup, which means... That he will hit 3+ Threes! Bettors love trends, right? This is a definitely a trend! 

[Betting on the zig zag betting theory! Fox has hit 3 Threes every other game for past 10 matchup. He came short on his last matchup which means he is due today!](https://preview.redd.it/y5zm7rakejhg1.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ae2185ba33240247435cd1012fd8357f85a270f)

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on De'Aaron Fox 3+ Threes. You can take conservative route and take him for 2+ Threes at -140 but I'm taking my chances since I am below 20 units. Fox hits 2+ Threes in the 1st half and hit his third in the 3rd quarter.

These events took place eight years ago, but it is an ongoing issue within my family. 

My younger sister, who I will call Susan, and I had always had a close relationship. Our parents divorced when we were young and we were largely left to fend for ourselves. This forced me to grow up before I should have, and I became a “mother” to my little sister. This also made me the person I am today; a people pleaser, doing anything to keep the peace, look after others, put myself last, always be the “bigger person”. Fast forward to us both having children of our own. 

Susan’s first born daughter, I will call her Veronica, is a year younger than my youngest child, a daughter who I will call Ashley. Veronica’s father and my sister were never married. So, Veronica split her time between them, from birth. Unfortunately, this lead her to being a very selfish child, and to becoming a master manipulator. She could pit one parent against the other in order to ultimately get her way. If she was mad at one parent, she would make an accusation about them to the other parent, resulting in a lot of time in court, with parents battling each other.  A lot of chaos caused by Veronica. She was essentially an evil mastermind at a young age.  

 

Susan eventually married and had more children. I was always the “fun aunt”, a second mom when needed, and I spent a lot of time babysitting. I was extremely close with my nieces and nephews/ loved  them as if they were my own children. 

Meanwhile, Veronica and Ashley are in the same grade in school (my daughter had a summer birthday, so I chose to start her in Kindergarten a year later) Ashley is 14 and Veronica 13 years old. 

I observed Veronica bullying my daughter, Ashley, in very underhanded and manipulative ways. I approached this, not by telling Susan about it directly, but by trying to equip my daughter with strategies for handling this in a “graceful” way. ( I now realize what a disservice I was doing both Ashley and Veronica. Veronica was able to continue to get away with atrocious behavior, as she had been able to do her whole life, and Ashley was forced into the dynamic I had always been trapped in, the person always trying to keep the peace and not make waves.) I know that my approaching Susan with this behavior would not have resulted in any consequences for Veronica, but I should’ve spoken up nonetheless. 

Skip ahead to me escaping an abusive marriage. My children and I fled with nowhere stable to go, so while I was getting it all together, two of my children stayed with Susan and her family, while I  and my other child stayed with my mother. (They lived very close to each other so I wasn’t far from my children, who were all in their teens by this time) 

Veronica had a large room of her own, in which she refused to allow Ashley to enter. Ashley shared a small room with two of Susan’s kids. The room had a bunk bed, so the two little girls shared one bed and my daughter slept on the top bunk. (This will come into play later in the saga) This is not meant  to sound ungrateful. I was extremely grateful that I was being helped in this way while I got my family’s living arrangements in order. 

Veronica’s behavior towards Ashley grew increasingly jealous and hostile. A few examples: Veronica had a huge bag of candy and when Ashley asked if she could have a piece, Veronica spit in the bag, so Ashley wouldn’t ask for or want any of it. Veronica left to go to her dad’s, and Susan told Ashley she could sleep on the floor in Veronica’s room while she was at her dad’s. Veronica came home, saw Ashley’s things in her room, flew into a rage, and started screaming and throwing Ashely’s things into the hallway. Susan was held hostage by her daughter’s insane, out of control behavior, so she stood by and watched this happen without reprimanding Veronica. 

Veronica’s behavioral issues escalated further, causing Ashley to reach out to me; asking that I pick her up and let her stay at my mom’s with me. 

This is where stuff gets crazy!!!!

I was finally able to find a place to live so my children and myself were reunited under one roof.  A few weeks after this move, Susan calls me and immediately starts screaming at me that her home is inhabited by an evil entity, brought into the home by my daughter, through her witchcraft. She tells me this is why Veronica had been behaving so terribly. (not because she has always been a little a-hole)

Susan was told this by a shaman that they had hired. The shaman had interviewed Veronica, who came up with a story about ouija boards and spells used by Ashley. (My children and I don’t believe in this or practice it in any way. I have no judgment against the people who do believe in this, but it isn’t part of our lives or beliefs) 

I am shocked by this spouting of, what I see as nonsense, by Susan and I don’t know what to say. After she gives me a break in the screaming to get a word in, I tell her that I don’t know what to say, but I will talk with Ashley to see if she is upset with them or ???? Again, I have no words, as I have been completely blindsided by this. 

I sit down with Ashley and simply ask, “Are you upset with Susan or Veronica?” She bursts into tears, and says “No, but Uncle (Susan’s husband) called  me today and told me there is something wrong with me and I have a demon inside me”.

At this point I lost my shit. I called my sister and screamed at her, how DARE they speak to my daughter that way?!! To never, EVER call me again. 

I called my mom, who apparently knew all about this, and said to me, “I know you are an understanding person, so you can see where your sister is coming from”. What in the actual F\_\_\_?!!!! I lost it on my mom at that point. We did later talk through things and agreed not to speak about it again. I told her I would not be “apologizing” to Susan, and in fact, I did not understand where Susan was coming from, nor did I plan to try. 

Susan and her family moved to a new home, and I was not to know where. It was all kept very secretive. Apparently, they didn’t want us to know, in case Ashley wanted to send another demon to haunt them?!!!!

A few dots that my kids and I connected after all of this went down- one of the reasons they felt they were being haunted was that, one of the children that Ashely was sharing a room with, kept waking up in the morning after having slept on the couch in the living room. The child couldn’t remember how she got there. (A few days before this began occurring, the child asked me when Ashley would be leaving because she and her sister were having to share a bed and they were uncomfortable). Could it be that she was uncomfortable in the shared bed, so got up and walked to the couch to sleep?! The child was only 5 or 6 years old. Could it be that she simply didn’t remember getting up in the night and moving to the couch? Susan and her husband’s belief was that Ashley somehow conjured a spell and “forced”” the child to walk to the couch. Ok?! Why? 

Another connection-After we had moved most of my kid’s stuff out of their house to our new place, my son returned to their house to pick up something he had left behind. It was late, and not wanting to chance waking them up, he simply entered the house, without knocking, in order to retrieve his item, as he still had a key. He saw their bedroom light on, so he went upstairs to let them know he was there. As he walked up, he heard Susan say to her husband  “Oh my god! Did you hear that? The front door just opened by itself”. She didn’t investigate. If she had, she would’ve realized it was my son. He heard his aunt say this and felt awkward, so he didn’t announce his presence, got his stuff and left. 

After we discussed this, my son let me know that his aunt and uncle take mus— sometimes. Could it be that perhaps this lead to a certain amount of paranoia? I mean, which is the more logical explanation? Paranoia from the shr— they’ve taken or my daughter can summon demons? 

Susan, reached out through text once, a few years after “the phone call” and said,  “Hi, this is your sister. I know you’ve been really busy, but maybe you could meet for coffee sometime?” I did not reply. 

Soon after this “apology”, I came face to face with my brother-in-law at the grocery store. It was a bit awkward, so I blurted out, “Hi, (name)”. He said nothing, turned around mid-aisle, and walked the other way. 

About a year after this upsetting interaction, my daughter and I walked into a Subway for dinner. As we waited in line to order, I saw ahead of me, my brother-in-law. Even though he was next in line to order, when he saw us, he immediately left the restaurant-without any food. 

I should also add that for years after this happened, Veronica “stalked” Ashley online. Viewing her social media posts, requesting to follow friends of Ashley’s, purposely sitting closely to her at school events. I feel that she was baiting Ashley, or at least wanting to constantly remind her that she had “won”. 

Based on Susan’s “apology”, my family thinks that I should once again be the bigger person and make everything right. Because I have done that my whole life, it is expected of me. I am for once, digging my heels in and I refuse to apologize or accept what everyone considers to be her “apology”. I am making an assumption here, but based on the way my little sister has been treated her whole life, she hasn’t been held responsible by my family for any of this. I guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as far as Susan and Veronica are concerned. 

My parents both say I should make amends with her, as she is the only sister I have. Apparently, I am being “unreasonable”. No one seems to understand the unforgivable aspect of this whole situation. At the VERY LEAST, I can never speak to Susan again because it would be a betrayal of my daughter. Not only did she devastate my daughter but she also took my nieces and nephews away from me. I haven’t seen or spoken to them for eight years.

We met back in the fall of 2022 so we have known each other for over 3 years now. She would always buy RedBull at the coffee stand I worked at on campus. I finally got the courage to ask her if she was single one day the week after Halloween of that year. She said yes. So I got her Snapchat and then we started flirting and we slept together and kept it casual up until mid-December and winter break. But I was in love and not communicating my actual feelings. While we were seeing each other throughout that time she explained to me that she had a son who had just turned 2 in August and that she was in the process of separating from his dad at the time. I didn’t mind that at all and my thoughts on the situation at the time were that it was impressive she’s working, going to school, being a mother, and trying to do what’s best for her kid. I thought it was admirable and attractive. She went back to California for winter break (our school was in Colorado) and decided to stay and not come back to school for the Spring semester because it was best for her son. Our contact slowed down but I was still in love so I finally told her in early February 2023. She said she could see herself falling for me too. I flew out to see her a couple weeks later and we spent a couple days with her son. She told me she loved me too over that trip and our long distance relationship started. We saw each other 2 times over the next year. She came to Colorado over Thanksgiving in 2023 to visit other family and I flew out to see her when her son’s dad had her son over Christmas of 2023. We were supposed to see each other again in late March of 2024 when she was coming to visit family in Colorado again but she broke up with me in early March. She sent me a text and not even a call. That should’ve been the end of it for me. Then a few weeks later she had a new profile pic on Instagram with a guy kissing her cheek at a baseball game. We stayed in contact for a few weeks after she broke up with me so I confronted her about that and she said it was an old high school friend who always does that for pictures. She explained a situation where they were posing for pics and swapped baseball hats to make it cute and she just added so many details that I believed her. That should’ve been the end of it again. But we lost contact eventually and I partially moved on. I got a a great internship/job that fit my desired career path perfectly and I finished my double-major degree in May 2025. And once I graduated I knew I had the ability to move anywhere to start my career or a masters degree. I chose California because I knew it was warm but not humid, the location would offer many job options, it fit my lifestyle, and the fact she was out here. I hit her up a week before I moved out here in early August of 2025. I explained I was moving out here for my masters degree and asked if we could get coffee, lunch, dinner, etc. and she declined because her life was still a mess. We didn’t talk at all after that until she randomly messaged me on Instagram on Jan 2, 2026. She hoped I was doing well and I said the same thing back and then said coffee or dinner is still on the table. She took me up on the offer and our first lunch went well on Jan 7, 2026. We went back to my place and just held each other on the couch with a few kisses. Nothing sexual at all. She came to my place on the 10th and I cooked her dinner and we slept together and she spent the night. She came down again on the 24th and we had dinner and slept together but she didn’t spend the night. Then I went up to a house she was dog sitting at and we ordered food and slept together on the 31st and I spent the night. Yesterday, on 2/3, I was bored and decided to look up some of her social accounts. I never use social media and she knows this. I found a YouTube video tagged with her username in it and clicked on it. It was a guy playing Fortnite duos with “his lady” as he said and this lady sounded an awful lot like this same girl I’m talking about. It was her. They were calling each other “love” and “baby” and there were videos/streams of them from 8 or 9 months ago about “1 vs 1 with my girlfriend” so I realized what was happening. I’m really not sure how I feel about it honestly because I’ve known her and had feelings of love for her for years now, but once that realization hit me and really sunk in after a few hours, I felt nothing. I think I’m still processing it because I definitely don’t feel like myself right now. I don’t really have friends and this is something I would usually talk to my family about but I don’t even feel like I want to or need to. I felt like I needed to express it though so I just wanted to put this here to get it off my chest. ",4,1770237089.0,CheatedOn,2,0.84,False

1qvzys0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1qvzys0/i_made_pourover_coffee_today/,I made pour-over coffee today.,"Until this year, I've only ever made coffee via automated coffee machines. Pretty simple: dump pre-ground beans into filter, fill reservoir with water, and press start. My current house doesn't have a coffee machine.

When one of my new roommates moved in, she brought with her a couple bags of whole coffee beans, for which she said she didn't have a use.

No one else was interested, but I had never used whole coffee beans before, and I wanted to give them a try.

An old roommate did leave behind a coffee carafe, which has sat unused, and another current roommate supplied an electric kettle.

I bought a cheap coffee grinder, a small kitchen scale to measure the beans, and some filters.

I found instructions online. My first few attempts were pretty weak, and I didn't have any milk, so I didn't enjoy them much.

This morning, I had just enough time before work to make a cup, and I had milk. I didn't even need the instructions.

This time, I used just enough beans to make a nice, strong roast. I love the smell of freshly-roasted grounds.

It tasted so good. And it was nice to save money and not spend $10 getting coffee from a café.

I was proud of myself for trying something new.

I think I'll get up a little early before work and make another cup tomorrow.",10,1770236996.0,BenignExistence,3,1.0,False

And I don’t mean just general frustration or discomfort or exhaustion. Everything about being pregnant makes me so unreasonably angry.  

I felt this way with my first pregnancy, but I was also very unsure if I was going to like motherhood; I was afraid a baby would ruin my career. But then I had my first and fell head over heels in love with motherhood. My career has skyrocketed. So I thought with a second pregnancy I might enjoy it more because I know that I’ll love the outcome?

But here I am. 9 weeks. And I’m so mad. I think it’s because I’m by nature a very private and independent person. And being pregnant feels like that takes that all away? I can’t control how other people see my body and just know that I’m pregnant (eventually) and feel entitled to talk to me about it. I can’t eat all the food I want, when I want. My body won’t let me drink coffee. I can’t wear the work clothes, or any clothes, that I want. I’m mad that I can’t sleep through the night anymore and I have to get up to pee in the middle of the night. I can’t take cold medicine.  

I know it’s all temporary. I know these are not major things. And I know it all seems petty and selfish that I’m mad I can’t eat a turkey sandwich and a latte. But it all just gives me this ridiculous rage that I know will last the next 7 months. Anyone else? ",9,1770236900.0,September2026Bumpers,3,0.91,False

She came to me today and asked for my help, she wants to be stronger and have good posture, her main concerns are becoming too weak to do basic household jobs and ending up with terrible posture (a lot of people her age tend to be leaning forward constantly and she doesn't want that to happen to her.)

At the moment she is more or less fine health wise, no concerns except her back gives her some grief, when she does too much it goes and she can be in pain with it for a few days but its not terrible. Other than that she's doing great for her age, she goes to a keep fit class once a week where they do basic cardio I think and she gets about a lot going out for coffees with her friends and stuff like that, so her health really is pretty good.

I'm not sure what to suggest for her, I was thinking of getting her some 1kg dumbbells and showing her how to do basic curls. Also thinking some wall push ups may be a good idea? I don't want to push her too much given her age but I want to make sure it still makes a difference.

It is very common that people will reach out to me to talk about career/jobs.  This year, I've already met with 8 people.

But I am often confused as to what the other person is trying to achieve in the meeting.  There is rarely an ask.  I try to not give unsolicited feedback/advice.

Gorgeous, jungle covered resort with great food, great pools, a rough beach, and decent nightlife.

You should consider this resort if:

* You want generally good (and sometimes great) food
* You want a resort lush with vegetation
* You want a long beach to walk on
* You enjoy elevated drinks
* You like an elevated “Hacienda-style” resort
* You like activities through the day and night

You should avoid this resort if:

* You are looking for a sleek/modern resort
* You are looking to party
* You want total tranquility
* You want to swim, and not just splash around, in the sea
* You need a good gym
* You want to dress very casually for dinner
* You want a compact resort with no walking

# Logistics

When? 7 nights late January

Room: Silver Junior Suite

Cost: \~$7000 CAD for two people, including flights from YYZ and shared transfer

# The Resort

The resort is in the Riviera Maya, about 40min from CUN. It is fairly spread out with a lot of vegetation and water features around the buildings. The lobby, restaurants, buffet, and coffee shop are located centrally but away from the beach. The rooms are spread across many buildings, some closer to the restaurants and others closer to the pools/beach. From the lobby it can be a 5-8min walk to the beach depending on your walking speed. Golf carts are available to drive you around on request, but we didn't use them

The resort has two big pools and one small one. The two bigger pools have bars and food options, including service to pool chairs. Only the main pool has swimup bars. The pools are beautiful with a lot of neat features and landscaping around them.

The beach is fairly long but most of it is rocky past the waterline, making it dangerous to swim (especially given the waves in the area). It is very nice to walk on however. There is a roped off swimming section to one side (directly adjacent to the ocean front suites) with a life guard on duty. The water is choppy, so swimming is off the table unless you get very lucky. There is a beach bar and service to beach chairs, but the latter can be quite slow.

Most hotel spaces include both indoor and shaded outdoor portions, and the landscaping is truly gorgeous.

During our stay, most of the clientele seemed to be 40-60 years old.

# The Room

We booked the silver room as it guarantees a king bed. It also comes with a jet tub and a double vanity, but be aware that the bathroom is \*very\* open concept. The room is only suited to couples.

The room was spotless and in great condition, and all rooms get both housekeeping and turn down service every evening. The silver rooms are closest to the restaurants and some of the furthest from the beach, but we didn't mind the walking.

# The Food

Breakfast was available at the buffet and the beach-side restaurant. We found both to be very good but generally preferred the buffet for its wider selection, especially of Mexican options.

Lunch was available at the buffet, the beach-side restaurant, and food trailers/snack bars by the two bigger pools. Again, both the buffet and the beach-side restaurant were very good. The buffet has a great and rotating selection of food from many cuisines, including authentic Mexican options. It also has made to order (simple) pastas, burgers, and stirfrys. The lunch at the beach-side restaurant is the best place to get pasta (in our opinion). The food trailers were terrible. Their menu is small and all items are also available in the beach restaurant but with much much better execution. We ordered from them once and left our food uneaten.

Dinner is only available in sit down restaurants. There is no buffet option. Except the beach-side restaurant, which becomes a grill/steakhouse for dinner, all other restaurants have a dress code which is enforced. Men are required to wear full pants, a collared shirt/tshirt, and non-sporty shoes. The dress code is more vague for women but essentially boils down to ""put in some effort"". The Mexican restaurant was by far our favourite (ask for their salsas and the corn soup). The only weak/bad restaurant was the Japanese restaurant. We did not have the sushi, but everything we had was disappointing, and we ended up going somewhere else to have more food. The Thai/Indonesian, French, and Italian restaurants were solid, though sometimes their menus were odd. e.g. the Italian restaurant a had very limited pasta selection, much more limited than the beach-side lunch menu.

Unless you get Prive (club level), there are no reservations for any of the restaurants. The Italian restaurant was the busiest when we were there, but otherwise the wait was at most 30 minutes. You are given a buzzer so you can go grab a drink while you wait.

The resort has a cafe, open early until very late. The cafe has coffee, tea, and assorted juice-based drinks, pastries, ice-cream, and sandwiches. The sandwiches are very good and they will pack them up for you to take with you on excursions/to the airport.

There is 24h room service. We only tried the breakfast menu and it was simple but comparable quality to the buffet/beach-side restaurant.

The only weaknesses of the food were bread/bread-ey deserts and steaks. I found the steaks to be quite tough and almost always overcooked.

# The Drinks

There are ample bars around the resort and you'll never be short of a drink. Good, but not amazing, spirits are included and there's no upsell. Basic wine is included, but you can purchase nicer wine at the restaurants (and only there).

The swimup/beach bars have all the standard frozen drinks you would expect. All the restaurants have a full bar and will make cocktails. Ask for the drink of the day.

The drinks tend to be 1oz pours, so we usually asked for a double.

There is an upscale cocktail bar with live piano. This is the default place to wait if you are waiting to be seated for dinner. The drinks are creative, tasty, and nicely presented. I would be happy getting any of these drinks at a nicer restaurant.

# Activities and Nightlife

There are pool tables and ping pong tables, tennis and paddle courts (all equipment provided free of charge).

There is a fairly extensive list of activities happening during the day (dance lessons, beach/pool volleyball, fitness classes, tequila tasting, etc.). We found that not many people participated in these activities, but enough did to make them fun.

Every night there is a show 9-10. We found them very mediocre and only went to one.

On most nights, there is live music 7:30-9pm and/or 10-11pm. This was held outdoors with both a seating area and a (small) dancing area. Most people sat, but there were always people dancing. A DJ would take over when the live music stopped. Our room was one of the closest to the music, and there was no noise in the room.

There is a foam party in the main pool every Sunday afternoon. I highly recommend this as it had great energy without being too crazy.

The gym is terrible. There isn't even a full set of dumbbells. I would not rely on anything other than the few treadmills that they have.

# Other

There is no time-share pitch.

The ""Prive Package"" (club-level) is only useful if you specifically want to lounge by the pool/beach for an extended period of time. Other than reserved bali-beds, it doesn't get you any meaningful perks.

Laundry service is very cheap at the resort. Great if you're looking to pack light. It came out to 120 pesos for 3 items.

# Conclusion

My partner and I are very happy with our choice. We had a great time, ate a lot of good food, and had a lot of tasty drinks. We loved the architecture and landscaping, and the service was flawless. For a couples vacation, the resort had enough happening that we didn't get bored.

I think this resort is great for people who want good food without breaking the bank (there was a very meaningful price difference between this and e.g. Atelier when we booked), but also want some liveliness around the resort (e.g. live music at night, some dancing, a small foam party, etc)",6,1770236503.0,AllInclusiveResorts,3,0.88,False
1qvzpnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qvzpnm/the_psychology_of_leveling_up_12_science_based/,The Psychology of Leveling Up: 12 Science Based Rules That Actually Change Lives,"I spent hundreds of hours going through books, research, podcasts and YouTube channels trying to figure out why some people just seem to level up while others stay stuck. Not because I had my life together, I was just tired of spinning my wheels. What I found changed everything.

Here's the thing nobody talks about: your brain is literally wired to keep you comfortable, not happy. The reticular activating system in your brain filters out anything that doesn't match your current identity. So if you see yourself as  just average,  your brain will actively work against any attempt to change that. Wild, right? But once you understand how this works, you can actually use it to your advantage.

This isn't some  fix your life in 30 days  garbage. Real change takes consistent effort over months, not miracle morning routines. These are the frameworks that actually moved the needle for me and tons of others I've talked to.

**Build systems, not goals.** James Clear breaks this down perfectly in [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). The book won multiple awards and completely revolutionized how people think about behavior change. Clear spent years researching habit formation and neuroplasticity, and the way he explains identity based habits is insanely good. The core idea: winners and losers have the same goals, but winners have better systems. Instead of saying  I want to lose 20 pounds,  focus on  I'm the type of person who doesn't miss workouts.  Your brain starts filtering for behaviors that match that identity. This is the best behavior change book I've ever read, hands down.

**Stack your habits strategically.** After you brush your teeth (existing habit), do 10 pushups (new habit). After you pour coffee (existing habit), write three things you're grateful for (new habit). The research on implementation intentions shows this increases follow through by like 300%. Your brain loves patterns and this hijacks that tendency. Pair it with the Finch app, it gamifies habit building in a way that actually keeps you engaged. You raise a little bird that grows as you complete habits. Sounds dumb but it works because it taps into the same dopamine loops that make games addictive, except this time it's working for you.

**Protect your attention like it's currency.** Because it is. Cal Newport's [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) explains why your ability to focus is becoming the most valuable skill in the economy. Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown who's published multiple groundbreaking books on productivity. The average person checks their phone 96 times per day according to recent studies. Every time you context switch, your brain needs 23 minutes to fully refocus. Do the math. You're losing hours of productive time daily. Block out 90 minute chunks for focused work. No notifications, no multitasking, just deep concentration on one thing. The quality of what you produce in those sessions will blow your mind.

**Consume information strategically.** Most people are just drowning in content but starving for wisdom. The Huberman Lab podcast is genuinely life changing for understanding how your brain and body actually work. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscience professor at Stanford and he breaks down complex studies into practical protocols you can actually use. His episodes on dopamine, sleep optimization, and focus are required listening.

If you want to go even deeper but struggle to find time for full books or long podcasts, there's an AI powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-le) that pulls from books like Atomic Habits, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio learning plans. You type in what you're working on, something like  build better habits as someone who struggles with consistency,  and it generates a structured plan with podcast style episodes tailored to your depth preference, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The content comes from vetted sources and goes through fact checking to keep things accurate. You can also customize the voice and talk to a virtual coach called Freedia if you want recommendations or have questions mid episode. It makes learning feel less like a chore and more like something that fits into your actual life.

Pair this with reading actual books instead of just scrolling summaries. Your brain processes deep reading differently than skimming, it builds neural pathways that improve critical thinking.

**Design your environment to win.** Your willpower is finite but your environment is always working. If you want to eat healthier, don't keep junk food in the house. If you want to read more, put books on your pillow. If you want to exercise, sleep in your gym clothes. This isn't about discipline, it's about reducing friction for good behaviors and increasing it for bad ones. The research on environmental design from behavioral economics shows this is way more effective than relying on motivation alone.

**Track everything obsessively for 30 days.** Not forever, just long enough to see patterns. Where does your time actually go? What triggers bad habits? When do you feel most energized? Use an app like Structured to time block your day, or just a basic spreadsheet. The simple act of tracking changes behavior because you become aware of what you're actually doing versus what you think you're doing. Most people drastically overestimate their productive hours and underestimate time wasted.

**Invest in your body religiously.** This sounds obvious but most people treat their body worse than their car. Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers by Robert Sapolsky will fundamentally change how you view stress. Sapolsky is a Stanford biology professor who spent decades studying stress physiology. The book explains why chronic stress literally shrinks your hippocampus and destroys your health, but also gives you the tools to manage it. Humans are the only animals who activate stress responses for psychological reasons, not just physical threats. Learning to regulate your nervous system is non negotiable. Exercise isn't optional, it's mandatory for brain health. The neurogenesis research is clear, cardiovascular exercise creates new brain cells in the hippocampus. Lift weights three times a week, walk 10k steps daily, sleep 7 8 hours minimum. Everything else builds on this foundation.

**Curate your inputs relentlessly.** The five people you spend the most time with literally shape your brain through mirror neurons. If you're surrounded by people who complain constantly, your brain starts adopting those patterns. If you're around people who are building and creating, that becomes your default too. This doesn't mean dump your friends, but it does mean being strategic about who gets your time and energy. Join communities around your goals. Find mentors. Listen to podcasts from people who are where you want to be. Your brain is a pattern matching machine, feed it better patterns.

**Embrace strategic discomfort daily.** Your comfort zone is a slowly shrinking circle. Every time you avoid something hard, that circle gets smaller. Every time you do something that scares you, it expands. The research on stress inoculation shows that voluntary exposure to manageable stress builds resilience. Cold showers, difficult conversations, public speaking, whatever makes you uncomfortable. The goal isn't suffering for its own sake, it's building proof to yourself that you can handle hard things. Use the Insight Timer app for guided meditations that help you sit with discomfort instead of avoiding it. It has thousands of free meditations from actual teachers, not just AI generated wellness content.

**Learn to process emotions instead of numbing them.** Most people's default response to difficult feelings is distraction. Bored? Scroll. Anxious? Netflix. Lonely? DoorDash. But emotions are data, not problems to fix. The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk is essential reading here. Van der Kolk is a trauma researcher who spent 40 years studying how trauma literally gets stored in your nervous system. This book will make you question everything you think you know about mental health and healing. When you feel something uncomfortable, pause and just notice it. Where is it in your body? What's it trying to tell you? This practice alone will change your relationship with yourself.

**Create forcing functions for your goals.** Put money on the line. Tell people publicly what you're doing. Sign up for the race before you start training. Buy the course before you feel ready. Your brain is wired to avoid loss more than pursue gain, so use that. Commitment devices work because they remove the option to quit when motivation fades. And motivation always fades, that's not a personal failing, it's human nature. Systems and forcing functions carry you through the valleys between peaks.

**Review and adjust monthly.** Set aside two hours at the end of each month to review what worked and what didn't. What habits stuck? Which ones died? What surprised you? What do you need to double down on? What needs to change? Most people set New Year's resolutions and never look at them again until the next January when they feel guilty. Monthly reviews keep you calibrated. You course correct before you drift too far off track. Use this time to plan the next month's focus. Pick one or two areas to emphasize, don't try to overhaul everything at once.

The compounding effect of these changes is insane. You won't notice much in week one or even month one. But six months in, you'll look back and barely recognize the person you were. Twelve months in, your life will be fundamentally different. Not because of one big dramatic change, but because of hundreds of small decisions that aligned with who you wanted to become.
