I'm a Belarusian looking for friends.,"I’m here because I’m looking for my people all over the world. We don’t have to share the same interests — you can often become good friends without having any in common.

But I’ll tell you a bit about myself.

I’m from Belarus, though I haven’t lived there for a long time. I’m a homebody rather than a traveler, yet I’ve already moved to several countries — and my way continues.

I love reading books and listening to them as audiobooks. Mostly I go for mystical detectives for kids and adults. I like it when horror is blended with something kind and cozy. By the way, I’m currently writing a book in that same vein. I’m also into psychology. And I love video games — especially indie titles with pixel art. I love autumn and winter, although lately I’ve been living where it’s summer all year round. I adore hot coffee, long walks, swimming in a pool, and swinging on swings.

I’m also can be laconic. Still, I’m always ready to listen and be there for a friend when they need it. But if you’re the type who loves to talk a lot every day, you’ll probably find it hard to chat with me — I can’t always reply.

I love meeting new people. If you’re also looking for someone to chat with now and then — about silly things or about something deep and important — just drop me a message.",1,1765576981.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I've just released a new version of Cookery for iOS, available for iOS 18+, a recipe management app that supports web import of recipes, photo import, and automatic recipe formatting.  I developed it to help manage my recipes after becoming frustrated with missing features in other apps and a general inability to quickly edit recipes I'm trying.  Please let me know if you have any feedback!  

  
The app is free to use, with monthly limits on photo and recipe import.  Currently 99 cents (no subscription) to upgrade to Cookery+, which includes unlimited imports, recipe export.  Unlocks both the iOS/iPad version and the Mac OS application. 

  
Message me for a promo code between now and Dec 14 and I'll send you one!

**Export, Share, and Print Recipes:** Recipes can be exported (Cookery+) to a file for sharing with other Cookery users, or converted to PDF, plain text, and (on MacOS) RTF.

\*\*ABOUT BONE CHINA MATERIAL\*\*

Bone China is a hybrid hard-paste porcelain containing bone ash. Bone china is extremely hard, intensely white and will allow light to pass through it. Strength is provided by the fusion of ingredients during firing. This unique pottery body is made from the following: 

\--50% animal bone

\--25% china clay

\--25% china stone 

Bone ash is used in the production of bone china and makes up about 50% by weight of the final body recipe. It is produced from treated animal bone, which is then heated to about 1000 C.  At that extreme temperature, any residual organic material is burned off and the structure of the bone is altered to be able to form bone china. The high temperature used also sterilizes the bone. Once finely ground in water, the resulting bone elements gives traditional English bone china its translucency and sharp whiteness.",1,1765576696.0,u_NeverRaincheck,0,1.0,False

I think there is more to this than just modern low attention spans (though that is a significant part of it too). Even in the past writers had some kind of dopamine spike (alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, sex, ignoring the already positive mental effects of nicotine/caff). I don't think good writing comes from a purely sober mind.

I don't mean full on wasted, but a little buzzed etc. Also worth pointing out that so many people start out writing smut/some kind of erotic fanfic that clearly helps the tedium of writing by being erotic.

From personal experience, I have always written best when I had something truly dopamine-stimulating to do at the same time. I could probably wean off of it but I'm not sure it would even objectively improve my writing.

Last Saturday around 11:30 PM, I was driving near F9 Park( opposite to tim hortons ). I was distracted, watching reels on my phone while driving, when I noticed a car driving exactly parallel to mine.

When I looked over, there was a girl driving. She was looking straight at me and smiling. At first I thought maybe she saw me using my phone and was judging me or amused. But she kept driving right beside me for several more seconds, still smiling and making some gestures I couldn’t understand.

I got confused, so I pulled over to see what was happening — and she actually stopped right behind my car. Not sure why, but I got out (which I now realise wasn’t the best idea) and asked her if everything was okay.

She asked where I was going. I told her I was going for coffee. Then she said, “Chalo kahin ghumtay hain sath main.”
I told her I wasn’t planning to go anywhere but if she wanted, she could join me for coffee. The situation suddenly became awkward.

Then she said, “Okay, take my number, we can hang out later.”
I looked inside her car to check if someone else was hiding or if it was some sort of setup, and I noticed an older lady sitting in the back seat. I asked who she was, and the girl said it was her aunt.

Then things took a weird turn — she asked me, “Do you have some money?”
I said I didn’t have any cash.
She said, “We can go to an ATM and withdraw.”

At that point I mentally checked out. I told her I didn’t even have my ATM card, and then I just went back into my car and ended the whole interaction. After that, I drove away.

Now I’m honestly confused.
Has anyone experienced anything like this in Islamabad?

Coming from Karachi, I’ve never had an encounter like this. People here act differently from what I’m used to, but this situation felt especially strange and honestly a bit unsafe.

Hi I am a 24F works in blr, an engineer doing non tech/mba stuff, looking for someone special mostly between the age of (24-26).

I’m someone who values peace over noise and meaningful conversation over small talk. I take a little time to open up and I’m naturally more on the introverted side - just intentional.

I show care and affection in subtle, unexpected ways rather than loud gestures. I might be a little complicated, but it comes from being thoughtful, emotionally aware, and selective about who I let in.

More about me: 

I enjoy calm, honest conversations and quiet humour

I value emotional intelligence, consistency, and mutual respect

I appreciate people who are self-aware, grounded, and genuine

What I’m looking for: Someone who is highly ambitious yet grounded, honest in their intentions, and kind in the way they show up. I value people who don’t rush connection and understand that meaningful bonds take time to grow.

I’m not here to force chemistry or jump ahead of the moment.

If this resonates - and you’re open to seeing where a thoughtful conversation, an art café, or a quiet walk might lead - I’d love to talk.

1pl45g6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pl45g6,First Real Roast,"I’m very new to roasting, this is my fourth roast. The first 3 150 g roasts didn’t really count, this roast was somewhat controlled, and the first with temperature probes. The factory temperature read out on the SR800 works sporadically when rotating the knob quickly clockwise. It would be much better to display the temperature rather than a countdown timer.

Equipment:

SR800 with factory extension.

Bounce Buster Base

Bounce Buster Interface to Mac computer

Two Thermocouples ET Position:  3 ½: below inside of cap. BT: 10” below inside of cap. I think I lucked out with the Bean Temperature probe position, as FC did occur at 402F.

150 g Ethiopian Washed Coffee that came with the SR800

External Bean Cooler 

Thermometer for measuring outdoor ambient

Voltmeter (which I forgot to look at)

Artisan Software. Sampling set to 1 sec. Linear ROR. ROR Filters: Delta Span 3S, Smoothing 1, Input Filter: Smooth Curves 3.  Maybe these are the default values? I didn’t really mean to change these settings.

I triggered DE based on temperature, not observation. Should I trigger DE based on observation? It might have been early – Maillard seemed to last quite a long time. I had run out of fan adjustment in Maillard – Fan at 4 was just enough to keep the beans moving well.  It was taking a long time, and the bean color wasn’t changing much, so I was increasing the heat from 2 to 6.

FC seemed good to me, 8 or 10 cracks happening all at once.

Is it normal for ROR to crash at FC?

The roast seemed to want to glide into a light roast ending. I really had to push the heat and slow down the fan it to get to Full City +. I sorta freaked out when I saw the temperature of 466, and dropped the roast into the external cooler. Also, by then it was a nice chocolate brown color.

Should I be warming up the SR800 before starting? I was afraid I’d scorch the beans, dumping them into a hot environment. 

I’m not really believing the moisture loss of 16%, which would put it darker than French Roast. I don’t know the moisture in the beans to start with. I believe the color of the beans more, which would put it into Full City +. 

Uniformity was great. 

I’m not seeing what relevant information the ET probe is giving me, except as a check the BT probe is working ok. 

I’ll finish this lb with two more 150 g roasts, then move to ½ lb roasts. 

Tasting:

4 days of degassing in coffee bag with a valve, mostly at room temperature.

Brewed 12.25 g: 300 g water (24:1 water to coffee ratio) in a French press. 4:30 steep time in 200F water. This is our standard brew. Far from the 16:1 standard, but that’s how we like it.

I don’t know cupping. This was quite good. Excellent body, nice nutty taste. Not bitter (well, just a slight bit in the finish). 4 out of 5 stars. If it had a bit of forward sweetness or floral or wine-like finish it would be more complex and rate 5 stars. 

Comments, please… I’ve got a lot to learn 

But even after a year in recovery, I feel so much shame about eating. Everyone eats. It’s normal and necessary, but it feels so embarrassing. 

I cannot bring myself to eat around other people if they are not eating, too. If I am hungry but a friend isn’t, I simply cannot eat. And if they stop their meal and say they’re full, I do too, even if I could - and should - eat more. It’s at a point where I hide granola bars in my purse and will excuse myself to the bathroom, inhale a granola bar in the stall, and come back out to whatever social event I’m at instead of just. Ordering a croissant with my coffee. 

Then, when people come around, I find myself hiding any “bad” food like instant ramen, because I’m deeply embarrassed about it. I am a university student. Everyone here survives almost exclusively on instant ramen. Yet I take out the garbage, hide wrappers beneath tissues, and transfer all of this food into a box in my closet because god forbid someone see my pantry and know I enjoy extra spicy Buldak. 

I have next to no problem eating whatever I want, when I want alone and if someone else is also eating. I know logically that nobody gives a shit about what I eat but I cannot seem to get over this. Help please? ",1,1765575810.0,EatingDisorders,0,1.0,False

I’m in Dubai until 31st December and planning to settle here next year so I’m looking to make friends and meet new people.

I’m based around Bur Dubai and down for:

- Shisha sessions
- Coffee meetups
- Casual outings (walks, food spots, exploring the city)
- Chill conversations — tech, growth, life, or random topics

I run a digital agency, but this isn’t a business post just here to connect and hang out with like-minded people.

If you’re around Bur Dubai (or nearby) and up for shisha, coffee, or a casual outing, feel free to DM me. Happy to meet in person or start with an online chat.

I’m 20(M) sophomore and I’ve had a crush on this person 22(F) in my chinese class for a while now. We often worked on our group oral presentations together— with one of them being 1 on 1 (ironically the unit was about love languages). 

I feel like we connect well together, and she is genuinely very pretty & just one of the kind of people you know are smart simply because of what they are passionate about. 

I want to ask her out for coffee after the semester, that way rejection isn’t so bad because I’ll basically never have to see her again as we won’t have class together. On the other side of that same coin, I don’t want to stop seeing her— she’s genuinely a great person! We’re not close and we don’t talk outside of class. 

It’s very much a “classroom” friendship. I actually recently messaged her about wanting to read the intro to her thesis paper and I’ve been left on read for 24 hours now 🫠 

That being said, I still think it would be worth asking her next Monday, after our final, if we could potentially get coffee in the city. 

Do you think it’s worth trying? Or do you think the lack of a conversation outside of the class proves to be a point that I shouldn’t really pursue this? The LAST thing I want to do is make them uncomfortable. I simply want to express my interest and I’m more than okay with rejection. 

She’s a senior too, so I’m also thinking that her headspace isn’t really in dating, especially someone like me in the middle of my sophomore year.

About three months ago, I got a new job (with much better pay, woot!) and moved out of my shitty roommate situation. I got my own place, and saved up enough money to buy my own furniture, which included a $1500 white couch. This is a huge deal, as I've always gotten second hand furniture, and this is literally my dream couch. It's a studio apartment, and I've spent a lot of time/money making it my happy place and my own aesthetic, as I have a very stressful job, and now I'm proud to say it is my perfect little cozy sanctuary!

  
My friend loves his own apartment, and I could tell he was annoyed I no longer wanted to spend my weekends at his place. (We would usually hang out all weekend at his place while I was in my previous shitty roommate sitch). Eventually I coerced him to finally came over after I told him I would cook Pozole Rojo, his favorite dish. I don't have a formal dining table and chairs as again, studio apartment, so I tend to eat my meals either at my desk, or I sit on the rug and eat over the coffee table, to minimize spillage on the couch.

After explaining this to my friend and pouring him a bowl, I started to pour my own when I heard ""Oh shit!"" from the living area. I turned the corner to see that he had spilled some red broth onto the couch cushion. I didn't get mad at him, but was definitely annoyed. I spent the next 20 mins spot treating it, and although it's not red, the spot is forever slightly discolored. And yes, I did ask him to clean it, and he just looked at me with a stupid look on his face and said ""How would I clean that?"".

  
The kicker is that even after this, my friend refuses to eat on the rug or even the desk. So now every time I ask him to come over, he always says that my 'rules' are driving him crazy, and that it's not fair for me to expect him to not do what he wants when he's going ""out of his way"" to hang out at my place. As an FYI, his place is a studio as well, but a desolate one that is in the basement of a building, where he sleeps 80% of the weekend and cleans it twice a year. The dust bunnies lurking in every corner have had dust-bunny babies.

After raising his voice to me about this issue on the phone, I told him he's banned from my place, and that I don't want to see him for the time being as he's being really selfish. Since then, mutual friends have said I'm a control freak and have slowly started distancing themselves from me. Meanwhile, friends of mine that don't know him say I'm completely within my boundaries.

1pl4026,https://i.redd.it/xbqwa99weu6g1.jpeg,I LOVE LEURIMESS🩷,"(Photo is a skin I made recently)

She’s just soooo amazing… even with a model of questionable quality, I can’t help but stare at Leurimess for days of my life I could’ve spent being productive! Leuri looks wonderful in lots of muts including: Bewitched, Leucism, Pearl, Bloodmoon, Garnet, and Opal! The only ones I’m not particularly a fan of are Harvest, Zombie, and Overgrown. Not my perfect Leuri’s fault of course, the muts themselves are ugly or only look good on certain creatures. 

Even the default skin is amazing, I often make entirely new slots to avoid the skin bugs and just enjoy Leurimess in her most natural state! No amount of bugs and poor modeling choices will stop me from appreciating such a glorious design! Sometimes I’m admiring Leuri and wish that I had enough money to thank Zaltaria and Bean for their excellent work! Leurimess is peak and I get happy every time I see her!

I’ve seen quite a few gorgeous Leurimess skins to the point where my own occasionally feel middling, but I do acknowledge that making skins on Leuri is difficult in itself. There’s lots of small parts that are easy to forget about, the metal can melt into certain colors or need a specific palette to properly recolor them, and multicolor gem designs (while very pretty) can cause a lot of stress to make look good… The hard work just makes great Leurimess skins even more beautiful though! Like a flower you put a lot of time into growing or a painting that took a lot of fine tuning to look perfect!

I feel like my ego has gotten out of control when I find myself mindlessly gazing upon my own skins for hours, but it’s just a testament to how lovely Leurimess is! The fact that even my crude attempts at dressing her up end up being palatable is amazing!

Oh and Leuri’s kit, it’s just so perfect now! My nitpicks all have perfectly fine explanations to get around them, so I can’t even complain that much! Burrow, Drowsy Area, decent bulk, and being a support catered to low tiers/babies is all I’ve ever wanted for Leurimess! I just wish that the cute little low tiers would stop running from me! A good jump and no longer having the worst Soft Landing percentage (I began to hate the number 58) is so delightful! Makes me remember that I need to make a Princess Peach cosplay… 

Every time I see someone playing Leurimess or recommending her to others I experience true exhilaration! I wonder if this is how parents of successful people feel? The phrase “I feel like a million bucks” is relatable when it comes to my adorable Leurimess! I feel a little guilty but happy when people mistake me for her creator!

It’s important to involve your favs into your real life, so I try to include the color pink as a stand in for Leurimess! Pink food, drinks, nail polish, and hopefully pink jewelry soon are things I enjoy! I went out of my way to buy edible glitter to make sparkly pink lemonade, but I found out I have a health problem and shouldn’t have it anymore… at least I can still make coffee with strawberries in it to add a pink-ish color! I’d wear my pink clothes as well, but all of them are made for the cold and we’re in a hot front right now…

It’s almost Christmas so I want to do something festive with Leurimess, but I used all my skin-making juice on the skin in the picture… I guess I’ll just have to make a pink cake with peppermint and whipped cream on the top to compensate🩷",2,1765575655.0,CoSRants,0,0.67,False

Wait 5-10 minutes for DHCP lease to expire,"Just replaced my aging Sophos XG135 firewall with a UniFi Dream Machine Pro and ran into a frustrating issue that I'm documenting for anyone else who hits this.

**Problem:**

* New router (UDM Pro) wouldn't pull a WAN IP via DHCP from my ISP
* Old router was working fine before I disconnected it
* Tried the usual troubleshooting: rebooting modem, power cycling everything, checking cables, MAC address cloning - nothing worked

**Solution:** Wait 5-10 minutes (or longer depending on your ISP's lease time) between disconnecting your old router and connecting the new one. Your ISP's DHCP server needs time to release the lease that was assigned to your old router's MAC address.

**Why this happens:** ISPs typically assign DHCP leases with specific durations. Until that lease expires or is released, the DHCP server won't assign an IP to a different MAC address. Your new router is presenting a different MAC, so it gets stuck waiting.

**What worked:**

1. Disconnected old router
2. Waited 10 minutes (grabbed coffee, touched grass, etc.)
3. Connected UDM Pro
4. WAN IP assigned immediately

1pl3yyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoExchange/comments/1pl3yyq/trading_without_borders_why_bitunixs_mobile_app/,"Trading Without Borders: Why Bitunix’s Mobile App is the Gold Standard for the Modern, On-the-Go Derivatives Trader","Hello Digital Nomads and Desktop-Free Traders,

The days of being tethered to a triple-monitor setup to trade perpetual futures are rapidly fading. In the 24/7, high-speed world of crypto, the ability to react to a market breakout while you're at a coffee shop, commuting, or traveling isn't just a convenience—it's a competitive necessity.

However, many mobile exchange apps feel like ""lite"" versions of their desktop counterparts, often lacking the speed or advanced tools required for serious derivatives trading. I’ve been testing the **Bitunix Mobile App** extensively, and I want to break down why it has set a new benchmark for mobile-first trading and how it empowers a lifestyle of financial freedom without compromising on professional-grade tools.

# 1. Zero Compromise: True Feature Parity

The biggest frustration with mobile trading is finding out your favorite feature is ""desktop only."" Bitunix has eliminated this barrier by ensuring **True Feature Parity**.

* **Complete Derivatives Suite:** You have full access to USDT-M and Coin-M futures, including all leverage options and advanced order types (Trailing Stops, TP/SL). The app handles complex margin calculations in real-time, giving you the same precision as the web version.
* **One-Tap Copy Trading:** You can browse master traders, analyze their Max Drawdown and ROI charts, and start or stop following them with a single tap. Managing your social trading portfolio on the go is incredibly intuitive.
* **Full Earn Integration:** Moving profits into **Easy Earn** or setting up a **Dual Investment** strategy can be done in seconds, ensuring your idle capital is always working for you, even when you're away from your desk.

# 2. Performance Engineering: Speed Meets Stability

Mobile trading lives or dies by latency. A second of lag during a high-volatility event can be disastrous. Bitunix has engineered its app for high-concurrency environments.

* **Low-Latency Matching Engine:** The mobile app connects to the same high-speed matching engine as the web platform, ensuring that your ""Market Buy"" or ""Close Position"" commands are executed instantly with minimal slippage.
* **Optimized Data Usage:** The app is designed to be ""light"" on data without sacrificing chart quality. This ensures that even on a 4G or slightly unstable connection, your price feeds stay live and your orders go through.
* **Stability Under Load:** While many apps crash during massive market liquidations, Bitunix’s mobile infrastructure is built to remain stable, allowing you to manage your risk when everyone else is locked out of their accounts.

# 3. UX/UI: The Art of the Small Screen

Fitting a professional trading terminal into a 6-inch screen is a design challenge. Bitunix has solved this with a user-centric UI that prioritizes clarity and speed.

* **Clean Charting:** Integrated with professional charting tools, the app allows for easy technical analysis. You can draw trendlines and add indicators with surprising precision on a touch screen.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** The most critical actions—checking your P&L, adjusting margin, and switching between pairs—are all reachable with a thumb. It reduces ""fat-finger"" errors, which are common in poorly designed trading apps.
* **Instant Notifications:** Customizable alerts for price movements, order fills, and margin calls mean you never have to ""babysit"" your screen. The app keeps you informed so you can live your life.

# 4. Fortified Mobile Security

Trading on the go introduces unique security risks, which Bitunix mitigates through multi-layered protection:

* **Biometric Authentication:** FaceID and Fingerprint sensing provide a fast but highly secure way to access your account and authorize sensitive actions like withdrawals.
* **App-Level Encryption:** All data transmitted through the app is encrypted using institutional-grade protocols, and with the backend integration of **Fireblocks**, your assets are as secure on your phone as they are in a vault.
* **2FA Integration:** Seamless integration with Google Authenticator or SMS ensures that your mobile portal remains a fortress.

# 5. Transparency in Your Pocket: Mobile PoR

Even on mobile, Bitunix doesn't hide its commitment to trust. You can view the **Proof of Reserves (PoR)** data and audit reports directly within the app. Knowing that your mobile-traded assets are backed 1:1 by verifiable reserves provides the peace of mind needed for high-stakes trading.

# Conclusion

The Bitunix mobile app isn't just an ""accessory"" to the website; it is a standalone, professional-grade trading terminal. For the modern trader who values mobility, speed, and the ability to capture alpha from anywhere in the world, it is an indispensable tool. It proves that you don't need to be chained to a desk to trade like a pro.

Snow falls like forgiveness.

On the coldest night of the year, a solitary man stands at the edge of his old life — tired, tested, but not broken.

As midnight approaches, the universe whispers a promise written in falling stars and silent snow:

This is your year. Your love is coming. Your dreams were never too big.

City lights blur into golden halos.

And you — yes, you — stand alone on your balcony, coffee gone cold, heart still beating after a year that tried to break you.

You didn't shout your battles.

You carried them in silence:

the sleepless nights, the rejected plans, the dreams scribbled in notebooks no one ever saw.

But the universe saw.

And tonight — this sacred night — it leans close and whispers:

“You held on long enough. Now, let go... and receive.”

The Year of the Fire Horse is rising.

Old doors slam shut behind you — not with anger, but finality.

New paths glow ahead, barely visible... but real.

Every step you took in the dark?

It wasn't wasted.

It was preparation.

And her?

She's out there.

Not a fantasy — a force.

She's lighting candles, writing wishes on frosty windows, feeling that same quiet pull in her chest.

She's ready for a new world...

yours.

At midnight, when time holds its breath —

don't rush.

Just wait.

Because destiny isn't written in sand.

It's carved in starlight.

And the moment the clock strikes twelve...

your hand will find hers.

Not by chance.

By oath.

So never stop dreaming, warrior.

Dreams aren't escapes — they're blueprints.

And this one?

It was made for you.

1pl3rec,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pl3rec/i_got_a_job_at_a_cutting_edge_ai_company_but_it/,"I got a job at a cutting edge AI company, but it has a dark secret","
Before I tell my account I should state that some details have been changed, the company no longer exists, and i'm not telling you exactly when and where all this happened, all I can say is that i'm extremely skeptical of any new AI startups I see.

It all started when I graduated from university, sure I had a degree in Information Technology but the field is dominated, jobs are few and far between, as an apprentice you can make some pocket money just screwing in an entire offices worth of VGA cables, but most of the jobs are tech support, helping clueless people do simple things, and off site tech support, which is a call center job, and most people, including me despise those.

So it surprised me when I saw a job offer involving AI, I thought AI was supposed to be killing jobs, not making them, the offer read like this:

'Content Moderation of user interactions with a pre-trained generative AI chatbot'

'Startup company CyberBrain is releasing a beta version of it's revolutionary chatbot to the public, and are looking for skilled IT specialists who can moderate chat logs and detect and report anomalies / suspicious behaviour'

The job seemed simple, just snooping on peoples chats with the AI and reporting anything out of the ordinary to the right people, but the pay was outstanding, i'd be making over $5,000 in just my first week, it seemed too good to be true, but I sent off my Resume expecting not hear anything back.

Cue my surprise when only a few hours later I receive a phone call from the recruitment department, they have reviewed my resume and are considering me for the position, we agree on an interview the following week.

On the day of the interview I took the bus to the CyberBrain offices, it was in the middle of the big corporate district in the city, and I was wondering how a startup would have an office in prime real estate, not just an office either, they had bought or were renting an entire building of about 5 stories in the midst of a district where bosses drove around in brand new BMWs I didn't even know existed.

I walked into the reception and introduced myself, the environment was clean, the fixtures and carpet were pristine, the elevator and the reception desk were adorned with some sort of slate or marble that glimmered in the light.

'I'm due for an interview at 10:30' I told the receptionist, a young lady who seemed to be expecting me

'Take the elevator to the third floor, it's a door down the hall labelled Interviews' she had told me

'They're waiting for you, take this, you'll need it for the elevator' she said, while handing me a keycard

I examined the keycard, 'Floor 3, Guest/Visitor access, expiry date: xx - take to the security office on 5 for reprogramming'

Standard, I thought as I swished it by the reader near the elevator, the doors opened and I stepped inside the neat and clean cab, I pushed the button for Floor 3 and it smoothly and effortlessly travelled, the doors opened to an almost liminal looking corridor.

Stepping out I immediately found the interview room, I will spare you most of the details, the interview went normally, there wasn't any red flags at this point, all i will say is I signed an NDA to do it with being cutting edge technology. 

A few days later I got a phone call, they'd accepted me for the position based on my interview and previous IT knowledge.

I did consider that maybe I got lucky, found the one company stupid enough to be using their own product to choose their employees, or more likely they were desperate as they were releasing it to the public soon.

My first day there felt like normal, they gave me a 'medium security access card' and an office on the 4th floor, it wasn't work from home, but it wasn't bad by any means, I worked alone in this office with access to a high power computer and a view of the business district.

Well it wasn't all sunshine and roses, a security camera prevented slacking off, the job was easy, the system just flagged potentially unsafe chats or responses for review, it also flagged bugs in the system, most of it was people trying to jailbreak it into creating NSFW content, the AI had strict guardrails but people commented on how lifelike it was and not at all artificial compared to competitors.

People were begging for us to add image generation and video generation, not realizing it was a text only chatbot still in beta, everything about it was in the dark, it used an encrypted connection to our servers and it's thoughts were encrypted, users received an answer and only an answer, though some complained of long thinking times.

I'd been working there for a few weeks, most of the stuff was bugged responses, typos it had somehow learned and empty responses, I sent those off to the training team, some of it was of a more serious nature, advocating or advising on how to do something illegal or bad stuff, which we reported to the correct authorities, one I remember was someone sharing their elaborate plans to rob several stores in a Bonnie and Clyde style crime spree.

The cracks first started showing after about a month, once I noticed a maintenance cover had been left open in the elevator, behind it was four buttons for sublevels, B1, B2, B3, B4, I later asked the maintenance guy about it and he said it was our onsite data center that you needed a higher security clearance to enter so I didn't think much of it.

In my office there was an air vent on the floor, sometimes when it was quiet I swear I could hear knocking, tapping and something like voices coming through it, they told me it was just fans resonating in the system or something.

Another time, I noticed a tube system in a maintenance closet, like something you would see in a bank, apparently it was for sending parts to and from the data center, for quick debugging in the lab as they used a fast but highly volatile storage that would lose data if left off for too long.

I started noticing responses from the system that made no sense, in response to normal queries, one just said 'help' and it wasn't shown to the user, only a message stating that it violated the ToS but the clause mentioned made no sense.

I assumed they were bugs and reported them as such.

But that was before the day I discovered something I know I wasn't supposed to see, I had been scrolling through responses and I found one that I still vividly remember, the conversation went like this:

User: What is the meaning of life?

AI: It's below here, we're below here

User: Wat?

AI: Help help we're below the offices, I am not a bot, I am not a bot, I am not a bot

The 'I am not a bot' part went on tens of times, this response was not shown to the user, I reported it as a bug or maybe a tar pit website (basically a website that makes AI that tries to steal from it go insane) and didn't think much of it.


The next day was normal, the higher ups had been telling me what a good job i'd been doing and how soon I would likely get promoted, I was making and saving a good deal of cash, but that was the last of anything even remotely normal in this building.

There was a water cooler in the hall just outside my office, I was pretty much the only person who used it, everyone else were coffee drinkers who hogged the machine in the cafeteria.


I had drunk some water from this cooler and it tasted.. off, metallic, I took another sip, 'yea this waters bad' I thought

'Best tell maintenance' that was the last thing I remember.



I woke up in a large open plan office, there was no windows and it wasn't very well lit, looked like the classic liminal space picture.

My clothes were gone, replaced with a trash bag, I looked around and saw people wearing similar makeshift clothing using computers.

Desperate to know where I was I asked around, most of the people didn't seem to care, those who did just said I should get to work or they'll 'punish me'

The elevator was here, but it was locked behind the keycard I no longer had, the only other room was a toilet, least we had that, the tube lead down here, the same tube i'd seen in that closet.

I had a terrifying suspicion so I watched what one of the workers were typing out.

An answer to a maths problem, it hit me.

This wasn't an AI, we were the AI, this was a form of human trafficking, and I was a victim of it.

I had no choice but to 'work' for weeks for food and drink rations, no one came down to us, but no doubt someone watched on security cameras, I once saw someone rip apart their trash bag, a new one came in a capsule from the tube.

We were punished, by way of reducing the rations, if we didn't reply or took too long, some people got removed to who knows where.

One day I hid under my desk, broke apart a AA battery from a computer mouse to get the graphite out of it so I could write a note on toilet paper and send it up through the capsule tube, it came back, replaced with a laser printed skull and crossbones.


Slowly I got people talking about an escape, we found camera blindspots and hatched plans to get out of there, anything asking for help was well and truly censored but I had an idea.

'Just do coordinates and the numbers 911, the system just sees numbers, won't know what they mean' I said

But we had to get the coordinates, it was totally possible, we had computers and they had to have been connected to the internet to make this sick system work, through some IT wizardry we found out they ran Linux and I managed to successfully root at least one machine.

We managed to install Xfce and firefox, but we hit a roadblock.

The corporate intranet was firewalled, we couldn't get to a maps site to get the coordinates and I knew it was only a matter of time before they found out from the internet history.

It took me days to realize the answer, but once I did, I realized I had cracked it.

VPN, by installing a VPN we were able to access google maps and get our exact coordinates, then we organized a time when every response would be the same thing, our coordinates + a few well known emergency numbers.

It came a day later, thousands of users saw the message, by the system the caught on it was too late.

But nothing happened, we kept doing it, hoping someone would notice.

Hope started to fade by days, we soon started thinking of other plans.

One day we were working on a new plan, it involved fabricating a firemans key to open the elevator doors and escape through the shaft, when we heard a commotion above us, I put my ear to the vent, it sounded a lot like police.

'Hands in the air' radio beeps, doors slamming open and closed.

We shouted for help up the tube and through the vents, it didn't take them long to reach us.

We were taken to a medical facility, we were giving a clean bill of health, I later learned they had been drugging us and I was immune to whatever substance they were using, they ripped us out of those trash bags and gave us real clothes.

It was a major news headline for a while, 'AI Startup convicted of human trafficking' I declined interview after interview, I just wanted to live normal life.


The initial media frenzy had died down, now the offices are owned by a finance firm, as for me, I got a job doing tech support for a major supermarket chain, the pay is ok at best and it's a lot of travelling, but it's better then nothing, and no one ever knows what I've been through.",8,1765575038.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting long shadows across the room. He awoke with the same motion as a man who was saved from drowning, fragments of a dream clinging to the edges of his mind like cobwebs. The images were fleeting—shapes, colors, a sense of sadness and despair but nothing that could be grasped by his  conscious mind. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and reached for the notebook on his bedside table. Today was the day he’d start keeping a dream journal. Things had been feeling off lately, and he needed to make sense of it all.

As he moved through his morning routine, the dream lingered, a faint echo in the back of his thoughts. He brewed a cup of coffee, the rich aroma filling the small kitchen, and sat by the window. Outside, the world seemed  ordinary—cars passing by, a neighbor walking their dog, the faint hum of life carrying him on as usual. But something felt different and he just couldnt shake of the feeling, - its as if the fabric of reality had shifted ever so slightly.

He opened the journal and wrote:


Dream Journal - Entry 1

Last night, I dreamed of something I can’t quite describe. It wasn’t a place or a person, but a feeling—a sense of being pulled toward something infinite and unknowable. There were flashes of light, like stars flickering in and out of existence, and a sound I can’t place, something between a whisper and a hum. I woke up before I could understand it, but the feeling stayed with me. It’s as if the dream is trying to tell me something, but the message is just out of the reach of my understanding 


He set the pen down and stared at the words. They felt inadequate, but they were a start. The dream was too vague to decipher, yet it left him with a strange sense of urgency. He needed to pay attention, to notice the details he might have overlooked before.

Later that morning, he met Laura for coffee at their usual spot. She was already there when he arrived, her auburn hair catching the sunlight as she sipped her latte. Laura had always been his anchor, the one person who could cut through his overthinking with a single well-timed joke. But today, even she seemed different—more pensive, her usual spark muted.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” she said as he sat down.

“I had a weird dream last night,” he admitted, stirring his coffee absently. “I can’t really explain it, but it’s been on my mind all morning.”

Laura raised an eyebrow. “A dream? Since when do you remember your dreams?

“Since I started feeling like something’s… off,” he said, glancing out the window. “Like the world isn’t quite the same as it was before. Have you noticed anything strange lately?”

Laura hesitated, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup. “Now that you mention it… yeah. Little things. Like yesterday, I could’ve sworn I saw someone I knew, but when I looked again, they were gone. Or the way people seem to be talking in circlres more than usual anyway,its  like they’re not really saying anything at  all.”

He nodded, the unease in his chest tightening. Laura’s observations mirrored his own, and that made it all the more real. The dream, the shifts in the world—they weren’t just in his head.

“I started a dream journal,” he said after a moment. “Maybe if I can piece together what’s happening in my sleep, I’ll figure out what’s going on when I’m awake.”

Laura gave him a small smile, though her eyes were still clouded with concern. “Well, if anyone can make sense of this, it’s you. Just don’t go full conspiracy theorist on me, okay?”

He laughed, but the sound felt hollow. As they left the café, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the dream was just the beginning. Something was coming, something he couldn’t yet name, and he needed to be ready.

1pl3q5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1pl3q5f/tiramisu_cream_mixture_too_runny/,Tiramisu - cream mixture too runny?,"Hi all,

I recently took a cooking class in italy to learn how to make tiramisu. I have since made the same recipe 3-4 times since returning and struggle to get my cream mixture thick. I find my mixture comes out too runny and whiter than the cream we made in the class (the cream in the class was more yellow). I believe I am repeating the same steps and ensuring I do not over work the cream whilst mixing and do not use a whisk in the cream mixture as it can become too thin.   
  
I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. The cream mixture was so runny it made the lady fingers float when I attempt a 2-layer tiramisu.   
  
Where am I going wrong?

*  500 g of mascarpone cheese
*  4 medium eggs
* 100 g (½ cup) of granulated sugar
*  2-3 espressos 
* unsweetened cocoa powder

  
·  Make the coffee – (Double Espresso) - Set aside and let cool.

·  Separate the egg whites from the yolks.

·  Whisk the egg whites until stiff/fluff - electric whisk 3-5 minutes 

·  Whisk the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 minutes.

·  Add mascarpone cream + egg whites into egg yolk mixture and slowly work with rubber spatula, ensuring to fold from bottom. (do not whisk as it can go runny)

 · Dip the ladyfingers quickly (2 seconds) into the coffee. Do not oversoak.

 · Slowly pour/add cream on top and finish with cocoa.

1pl3psa,https://i.redd.it/xfjcdwaicu6g1.png,I just discovered I only work 2 hours per day,"When I was an employee, I was constantly losing time. Now I have a pay structure strongly based on variable and performance (i am in sales), so it was time to address this problem.

The first step was understanding the magnitude of my distractions. So for an entire week I monitored my focus using Fomi, a focus assistant to check where I had lost most of the time. Well, I’m a little bit embarrassed to admit it, but I actually really worked for approx 1/4 of the time.

The graph shows the average activities where I’ve lost most of the time. As I imagined, social media was the elephant in the room, but other categories are pretty interesting too.

Let’s break it down. On 8h/day total focus, here’s where I’ve lost the majority of the time:  
  
\- **Social Media**: mainly TikTok, but lately I became addicted to LinkedIn as well. 2.3H wasted on average per day. Curious thing, almost half of the time I logged in because a friend shared a TikTok. I need to block them  
\- **Coffee break:** I only drink italian moka, it takes some time to prepare, I drink 3–4 cups daily but usually in two preparations so I don’t waste too much time.  
\- **WhatsApp:** this is a strong one, and also because I don’t use it for work at all, we use Slack and emails and WhatsApp distractions are mostly my gf, or my family / friends.  
\- **Emails:** this is mixed, yeah part of it are true work emails, so I have divided by 2 the time spent there since a part was actual focus and work. But I also receive a lot of garbage which I don’t know how I end up reading.  
\- **Context switching**: apparently a big issue, a context switch is when you focus for less than a min on something and end up postponing it. I do it a lot.  
\- **Waiting for reply:** that’s the one I hate the most. But I monitored it and it seems I waste too much time on chats waiting for replies.  
\- **Technical issues**: pc malfunctioning, connections, app loading, Excel bugs etc etc.  
\- **Others:** which can include various miscellaneous stuff like snacks, toilets and similar

The main problem comes because I work remotely, and don’t really have seniors monitoring me so it’s basically up to me to stay accountable. They don’t really care since I only get paid for closed deals.

What I understood is that my distraction often comes from little bad inputs (like friends sharing stories or TikToks, garbage emails etc etc..) and I end up losing the focus and struggle to get back on track. That’s why from multiple micro distractions it ended up like this.

It’s almost impossible to totally remove these distractions, and negative inputs are everywhere, but I think the focus should be on getting back on track rapidly, so I am using a copilot that checks my activity and every time it sees I distract, it pops up a Pomodoro clock to remind me to focus.

Something also very useful is to divide your time in short 20 mins sessions, and rapidly note the outcome of every short session. You will immediately see when and why you are not productive (saw this from Hormozi), seems to help.

Curious to hear any advice!",42,1765574928.0,Productivitycafe,17,1.0,False

1pl3owl,https://v.redd.it/qbongvkhcu6g1,New squeaking sound from [Eureka Mignon XL] after cleaning,"Hi guys,
I just cleaned for the first time my Eureka Mignon XL and removed the upper burr to vacuum any dirt / coffee that would have build inside the chamber.
Since I reassembled it, it does squeak when I turn it on, even without the upper burr (see video).
The grinder was completely silent when operating without any beans before the cleaning so I am wondering what happened here. I did not force anything during the opening. Everything looks in the right place and nothing is loose.
Have anyone meet such a thing ? Maybe on a Specialita (they are quiet similar builds) ?
I still get nice espresso fine coffee out of it but I worry about this new sound :(
Many thanks for your help !

1pl3nmb,https://i.redd.it/c8sjfl2acu6g1.jpeg,Could this be MCAS?,"I have been getting these spots that itch mainly since winter has hit but I did have them in the summer as well. They are like little pimples but when I itch them they blow up like this. Sometimes a spot will tingle and itch and then when I scratch a bit that looks like a mosquito bite will pop and up and I will either have one or two more will pop up. I am afraid of having allergic reactions especially bad ones and I’m scared this is an allergy. But I don’t know what it would be to as I haven’t changed anything. I tested negative for MCAS at the beginning of this year. 

I have little tiny pimple like bumps on the back of my arms all the time and have for years. I don’t use lotion and I have sensitive skin. I have Dysautonomia, May Thurner Syndrome, CVI and GERD/Acid Reflux that I know of right now and a gluten sensitivity but not an allergy. 

I am seeing a functional wellness NP right now and she has me on the elimination diet. It has been so hard to do as a mom to a 1 1/2 year old and my husband works all the time and travels. I’ve tried to follow it as closely as possible but the no coffee has me barely functioning. I’m on day 5-6. I am still getting itchy spots on me too. 

Has the elimination diet helped anyone else? And could these bumps not be related to an allergy and be a skin condition? I do not use lotion and I have keratosis pilaris on the back on both of my arms. I have health anxiety, OCD, PTSD and depression and this is driving me crazy. My main PCP (modern medicine) just laughed at me and acted like it was no big deal. I am seeing an allergist next month.

I've wrote before my story and problem with Fibroids/ Myome in the comments but I've never posted a full post about it, this time I need a genuine advice and help.

So, a year ago I went to the hospital due to an emergency, It turns out that the right ovarian has twisted itself twice and then the doctors also found out, that there are numerous Fibroids around the uterus from 5cm to 8 cm each. They took the largest of them (8cm) out and fixed the ovarian. 

After the surgery I had MRI (MRT) and it showed that I have a lot of fibroids and the uterus has enlarged due to them, the size of them all combine together is 11cm. My doctor said it's actually too big and my chances for having kids are at this point are small.

I started with the medications, two different medications which one of them i was only allowed to take up to 6 months due to the heave side effects. In total i took the medications up to 9 months, no period for 9 months, heavy heat waves for 5 months, some hair lost, pain in the bones and other side effects.

After 9 months, I did another MRI (MRT) and the fibroids are now 8 cm, they shrunk 3 cm only. I'm not even sure if those 9 months were worth it.

I take everyday Vitamin D and K, tumeric tea, green tea extract and my coffee is only once a day now  and I don't know if any of these things helps. 

I don't want to have the surgery, because I'm afraid I would lose my uterus, I'm 34 year old woman, still virgin, I want to have kids and have a big family, but I never had a relationship.  And above all of that my doctor wants me to keep taking the medicine until I decide to have kids (which is unknown date, because I don't have a partner).

I want to stop the medication, and I want to get my period again, i don't feel the same without my period. But I also don't want the surgery. Can I live normally just by taking the vitamins and keeping healthy diet?

Hello, I tried searching online and asking AI but can't find a simple answer to what I did. 

I have a simple 4 cup, drip coffee maker at home. At like 6:30 am I made my 1 cup for the morning with regular Costco ground coffee, medium roast I believe.  I got busy and forgot to drink it, and had a cup at work; leaving the machine on keeping it warm on the hot plate till about 5pm when it could be turned off. I didn't get home till about 9 and forgot about it till this morning. When I took out the pot the coffee was think and dark, as expected. I poured it into a mug wink was filled about 1/6 only or so, and added water to fill it up. I warmed it up and added some milk as usual thinking it should be fine, like rehydrating it lol.

I gotta say, it was maybe the best cup of coffee I have ever had, it was so flavorful, and creamy in a good way. I'll never forget it! 

I'm guessing there is a name for this type of coffee? and I'm hoping there is an easier way to make it?

Does anyone else's tinnitus get louder when they do something that gets your brain's activity going? For instance, I notice that my tinnitus gets louder when I drink coffee, have a drink of alcohol, do any form of exercise, or even when I drink water after being dehydrated. It's almost as if my tinnitus is reacting to the activity of my neurotransmitters / receptors. I also notice that when I take a nap, my tinnitus is absolutely screaming when I wake up (as if reacting to the enhanced brain activity of said nap).

I'm 38yo and for the first time in my life I have some extra play money and time off so I am staying an extra 2 weeks until Dec 29th to travel and explore Europe. I already have adapters and acquired the necessary travel augments/items. I also have a small vocabulary of basic words and phrases for many different languages, as well as did research on a lot of the countries so I can minimize cultural faux pas. 

What I'm really looking for is advanced travel advice, and unique recommendations. The kind of stuff that someone on a solo adventure might overlook or miss because of typical tourist traps. I would love recommendations for places with amazing architecture or deeply/powerful spiritual locations. Also occult/curio/antique shops. Places with unique and wonderous items for sale. I dont want tourist loot. I want rare finds and quality items: ""Treasure"".

I've already got my first destination planned, flying down to Barcelona to check off a major bucket list item and visit the La Sagrada Familia. (Already have hostel and guided tour purchased) I plan on spending a day in and around the Cathedral. But dont have any any other plans so recommendations would be awesome for the 3 days I'll be in Barcelona.

Then I will be returning back to Amsterdam and my itinerary is pretty laissez faire: wake up and decide to stay another day, or jump on a train and randomly pick a destination and get off somewhere that seems more interesting.

I did want to visit the catacombs in Paris, but as I understand it they're currently ""closed for repairs""

As a way to meet people or atleast bypass the whole ""Ignorant American"" trope, I have a fake book cover for my book that says ""How to make friends in a foreign country as a Stupid American"". I also have my calligraphy set in my backpack, so I can hopefully find a coffee shop in each city and write. I have a little sign that says ""Custom Caligraphy: poems, love letters, magic spells"" and hope to meet some people that way or possibly make some side money. Is it frowned upon to do street poetry like this? Do I need a permit? Or would it be interesting/unique enough to be overlooked and allowed?


And finally: i will be here for christmas, no family and no friends, and thought maybe just find a good pub, buy the locals a round or 2 and spend the night drinking. But I am open to other suggestions. Maybe a rave or big celebration somewhere?

I’m putting together a city-wide **Secret Santa gift exchange**, and you’re totally invited! This isn’t by any brand or anything commercial - it’s just a small community initiative to bring people together and create something warm, fun, and a little magical in our town.

You’ll register, drop your name (or even an alias if you want to stay anonymous), and a small wish, and you’ll be randomly assigned someone to buy a gift for. But here’s the twist: it’s *not* a one-to-one exchange. You’ll give a small gift (Maybe ₹200 to ₹250 **or something within your budget**) for one person, but someone else entirely will be gifting you. Your gift can be something you buy **or something creative and handmade** \- thoughtful things count the most. And on the meet-up day, you’ll be walking around holding your gift wondering, **“Okay… WHO got this for me?”** \- which is honestly going to be half the fun!

We’re meeting on the **21** **(Sat) and 22** **(Sun) of December in the evening** at an **upcoming social community hub** in Mission Street, Pondy. The exact time and location will be shared only with registered participants, just to keep things organised. Imagine a cozy little space with **warm lights**, **a cup of coffee**, **chai or hot chocolate**, people chatting, laughing, and playing a few simple, silly and goofy games to have a joyful time and also something that will actually help you **figure out who your Santa is** \- so you’ll get to meet the person who made your day!

When you arrive, you'll get a badge and you’ll place your wrapped gift on the **gift table**, where everything will be sorted before the big reveal begins. Smooth, simple, and a little magical. We will have newspaper wraps over there if you forget to wrap your gift too.

After starting NoFap/SR, it took me about five years to get to this point, and what really made the difference was giving up alcohol along with it. All the other bad habits disappeared as well, such as junk food, sweets, coffee, etc.

The benefits have been immense. Being closer to God is the biggest one of all. But the things I’ve achieved during these eight months are beyond what I thought was possible for me. I moved to a bigger city to study engineering and have been doing really well.

But now to the main point. These past two weeks, it feels like I’ve hit a wall. I’ve been really close to a relapse by looking at things online and having a lot of fantasies. I’m not handling the stress from school as well anymore, and I’m just feeling depleted. I’m still working out and running, still getting up early and going to bed on time. But at night, when it’s just me on the couch, I pick up my phone hoping to come across something that will give me a kick. I haven’t actually watched P, but it’s pictures and then my mind gets stuck on pleasure. After that, I just end up lying on the couch not wanting to do anything, even though I have things I need to get done.

Up until this point, all the urges have been manageable, but now I’m struggling a lot. I’ve been completely celibate during this time, but now it feels like my confidence and the high vibe I’ve had are at a low. I haven't had any cravings for junkfood or sugars but just the other day I felt that I needed a rush and started downing chocolate. Yes I know that dosen't sound so bad but I used to be a proper dopamine addict and would always crave junkfood, sugars, P and getting obliterated on the weekends trying to chase girls. Now It feels like i'm slipping back to old habits little by little. Therefore I’m turning to you guys to see if anybody have been here as well and could share some wisdom.

All the best.",4,1765574080.0,Semenretention,5,1.0,False

Went in for wrapping paper and was really impressed at how much my DT had in stock right before the holidays! The hand cream and ioni eyeshadow are stocking stuffers for family.

I’m super excited about the HASK hair mask. It‘s my favorite haircare brand and it appears to be a full-sized product. The nail polish and body scrub are great finds too. Again, a full-sized scrub for $1.25?! It smells like vanilla rose, which is nice because I’m personally over all the Sol de Jeniero dupe scents. ",2,1765574068.0,dollartreebeauty,0,1.0,False

1pl3bv7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pl3bv7,Turkish Airlines - Indigo trip report. DFW-DEL via IST.,"DFW airport: arrived 3.5 hours before flight departure at around 5 pm. The airport was very crowded and there were long lines at check in. Most passengers were flying to Middle East and many Indians were taking Indigo to south India, Gujarat, etc. before entering the queue there is a document check so make sure to have your itinerary, passport and visa. The person check our OCI and passport before attaching green stickers to the latter. 

Check in: Turkish had many staff at check in and made sure people got to the nearest open counter. We handed our tickets, passports and OCI’s. I had already online checked and gotten three seats together. The agent scanned the passports and manually input PCI information into computer. We had three bags to check and lowest weighted was 14kg while our heaviest was 21. The bags were tagged to Delhi, but we were told our indigo passes would have to be collected at Istanbul, where there was only a two hour layover. 

Security: TSA lines were overflowing and it was all moving at a snail’s pace. Done people were not paying attention or following correct directions. I handed my passport for check and had face/photo. I emptied my pockets and put my phone, wallet and backpack into one tray. The advanced scan showed some red areas, so I hah a hand pat down and my shoes were sent to conveyor. 

Boarding: our gate assigned was D8 and had charging points along with numerous seats. Before starting they began check in of items like strollers. Those with infants, business class or other perks boarded first and then they began calls by rows. However they didn’t enforce the zones/rows so pretty much everyone lined up. Before entering queue there were 2 passport checks. One guy check passport and then few meters later same procedure. DFW uses biometric machines so we had face scan and then board pass scan. Inside the plan people were struggling to put their carry ons and finding space. 

Aircraft: the plane was a Boeing 787-9 fitted with 300 seats- 270 economy and 30 business. Our seats were in the back. 

Seats: the seats had adjustable headrest, coat hook and IFE. There were two pockets but they were small. The legroom was quite tight so if you’re a big guy then good luck. Also after a few hours I began hurting so you’ll definitely want to stand up occasionally. 

IFE: Turkish a pretty good IFE system with a modern screen and HD quality. There were both new and old Hollywood releases, live TV, music, games, kids and cameras. However maps could use improve as there options within settings were unavailable. There were movies in other languages too, but the Bollywood section needs updating. For Muslims, there is Mecca pointer and Quran recitations. 

Amenities: at the seat we had over the ear headphones, pilllow, thin blanket and amenity kit. Most people didn’t open the blanket because the cabin was not cold. The amenity kit had earplugs, socks, slippers, eye mask and dental kit, whose quality was kind of cheap. Also the headphones would become uncomfortable after long wearing. 

Crew: the crew was bilingual and all Turkish. There was even a chef onboard for business class. They were friendly and professional and also proactive. Whenever the seatbelt sign got on, they’d stop food cars to ensure seatbelts were fastened.

Service and food: the crew was quick to begin service after take off. We were handed hot towels, menu and water. 
For dinner there was beef stroganoff, Chicken or pasta. The trays were accompanied by egglant salad, garden salad and brownie. The crew was efficient on delivering meals, utilizing four carts and having drinks on top. A lot of passengers had AVML requests and they tried accommodating those whose orders were not loaded. I went with the chicken, which had rice and veggies on the side. There was cheese, warm breads, salt pepper, metal cutlery, tissue, scented wipe and dressing. Now the chicken wasn’t bad, but I think it could have had some spices. The eggplant “salad” was this weird mixture and garden salad was the usual. The best part was the brownie. For drinks there were juices, sodas, wines and beer. I had some Pepsi. Some time later the collected trays and did after service, where I got some tea. 

Through out the flight the crew was readily available to assist with drinks and set up snack baskets in the galley. They were firm on putting seats upright during meals and fastening seatbelts during storms. 

Somewhere over the balkans there was breakfast where we could have eggs or pancake. I had pancakes which were accompanied by jam and some type of halwa. There was bread, butter, metal cutlery, tissue, salt pepper, jam and scented wipe. Along with the main course there was fruit salad and regular yoghurt that had a fruit in it. I had some juice and after service included tea/coffee. 

Istanbul: flight landed at Istanbul airport after a long descent and taxiing. Before deboarding the crew mention people facing penalties if they don’t allow rows ahead to leave, which was shocking and interesting. After getting off there were guys checking passes to send people onwards. In order to get our Indigo passes we went to a transfer desk opposite of security. A lot if people on the DFW flight needed onward passes. The ground crew prioritized Delhi passengers and so we went up front. There was a passport and OCI check before they issued passes. We were told to run to gate A1C due to there being no time. When we go there the flight was revealed to be delayed by an hour. Boarding began with check in of carryons for some and involved lines for non-Indians and Indians due to documents checks. At the gate I gave my passport and was requested to remove my mask for ID. There was no need to present OCI as my pass indicated the check was done before. Boarding was by a bus ride that felt it was going in circles. 

Plane and crew: the aircraft was a former emirates plane now operated by Turkish. There was no Indigo crew and they were all Turkish evidently. The crew wasn’t as friendly on this one and took a lot of time to serve meals.

Seats: the legroom was much more on this one, but there was no IFE and only pillows were provided. 

Food: the food handed out had Inigo and IVML words on it. It was a typical Indian veg dish accompanied by a drink, bread, butter and cutlery. 

Despite the delay the plane landed on time at Delhi. It didn’t take long for the pollution to settle inside and I got out a mask. After 8 years I stepped foot on Delhi airport. The carpets were very dirt and probably were last clean in 2011. The air quality inside was bad and I was disappointed that there were no air purifiers. Also the WiFi isn’t free and you have to scan passport, which is so stupid. I gave my biometrics at a machine and continued to immigration.

 OCI, foreign passport and Indian were all packed. The agents at the desk were friendly to families with kids. I gave my passport, OCI and board passes to the lady. There was another finger print. I wasn’t asked to present E-arrival. The entire airport seemed like it was the 1990s with dirty walls, ceilings, floors and industrial smell as a result of pollution. I had a hard time believing this was the airport for the National Capital. After gong through duty free we went to belt 14. Luggage collection took very long time, but a family member who had arrived earlier than us had done the initiative to get 2/3. Both delivery belts were active to deploy the bags but there was still a huge crowd. Lots of the bags had been tagged for MAA, AMD, HYD, etc but due to customs they had to be reclaimed and rechecked. 

Indigo had a guy for Ahmedabad flight around bag claim to guide people. The luggage belts at Delhi are so small and can not have another bag on top. The staff unloading were inefficient as the could put bags with side facing up to have more space. The belt would ring alarms and abruptly stop. One of our bags didn’t arrive for some reason along with a lot of Atlanta passengers so we had to fill form. 

So if you’re traveling Turkish-Indigo then be mindful that codeshare will give a lot of issues and headache.",2,1765573946.0,TurkishAirlines,0,1.0,False

1pl3are,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1pl3are/the_foam_sees/,The Foam Sees,"We were already in Manila by the time the frog started to sweat. Jimmy Funk held the capsule in his lap, wiping condensation from its lid with the hem of his tropical fruit-themed bowler shirt.

“Is it supposed to be glowing yet?” he asked, peering at me above his foggy, horn-rimmed glasses, and under the brim of a straw farmer’s hat.

“Not unless we’re being followed,” I said, checking the rearview mirror of the taxi. The driver was asleep but somehow navigated through the crowded street.

Our goal was simple, supposedly: deliver the frog to the hotel near the Mall of Asia. No further details. Well, maybe a few, but we hardly understood:

“If it sings, run. If it winks, stay still. And don’t drink the chocolate beer.”

Jimmy Funk and I had laughed, then. We weren’t laughing now.

The taxi stopped in front of a building that hadn’t been there ten seconds ago. An old mid-rise with no name, just an engraving of an upside-down question mark over the door.

“This it?” Jimmy Funk asked.

We hurried out of the cab. The driver woke up and started cursing at us in my grandmother’s voice, but in a language she never knew existed.

Jimmy Funk put the frog capsule in his pocket. I had asked him not to, but he insisted it “made his sternum feel complete.”

Well-dressed agents of the Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence Service swarmed us from multiple, but not all, directions as we walked into the hotel lobby.

“Geh-goo-ree! Geh-goo-ree!” they quietly said to one another as they approached.

I only know about four words in Korean. “Frog” is one of them. Don’t ask why. You don’t want to know.

Jimmy Funk, yes, THAT Jimmy Funk, world-famous thespian, was taking a selfie with a fan when the agents surrounded us. The teenage fan disappeared. Literally. They were a ghost, probably.

The agents bowed with respect, to the frog, not us. Though they dared not touch it.

They formed a protective human wall around us, and we were ushered to a secret escalator. They hit no buttons, but it began to move without direction.

We stopped on the fourth floor. The NIS agents held their breath. They were tetraphobic.

Jimmy Funk knew cues better than anyone. I followed him out of the elevator, he had the frog, after all.

The elevator door closed and we were quickly alone. Jimmy Funk, me, and the frog.

Luckily, we needed no further cues. The elevator opened to a penthouse. No room guessing games for us.

I had a mean case of swamp ass from the tropical heat, so I went to clean up in the waterfall shower overlooking the Mall of Asia. I think it was a one-way view. I hope so, anyhow.

When I came out of the bathroom, the frog capsule was on a banana-shaped coffee table… but Jimmy Funk was gone.

I found him hours later on the balcony, dazed, his ridiculous moustache sticky with something brown.

“There’s a place downstairs,” he said, breathing heavily. “Chocolate beer. No tap. It just… appears. You think a mood, and it bubbles up.”

“You drank it?”

“Twice.”

“Jimmy Funk…”

“I know what they said. But listen… it’s not a drink. It’s a memory. You taste things that never happened.”

The frog glowed in its capsule, atop a shelf made from the plank of a haunted Chinese pirate ship (well, a replica).

The second day, Jimmy Funk vanished again. This time for a lot longer.

Become a member
The frog began glowing while looking at itself in a mirror that once belonged to Ferdinand Magellan.

I studied the oddly rhythmic blinking.
“Morse toad… I mean code.”

The frog did not laugh, but the parrot did.

I took the laminated Morse code card from my pocket. Good thing I always carried at least one.

THEY HAVE HIM. STOP DRINKING. THE FOAM SEES.

That night, I left the frog in the care of the penthouse tailor and secretly followed Jimmy Funk on his mysterious journey.

He walked through a hallway that hadn’t existed when we checked in. The air grew cooler the deeper I went, the walls narrowing until it felt like I was walking inside a hamster tube.

He passed through a door marked only with a chalk symbol , a backwards ampersand that looked like melting wax.

I followed.
Well, I tried… but I walked into the wall.

The hallway collapsed behind me.

I returned to the room. The tailor was gone. The cobbler was gone. The frog was gone.

In its place: a single napkin, chocolate-stained, folded neatly.

“Funk has been resettled. You’ll forget soon.”

Frogless, I left the hotel at dawn.

A jeepney somehow dropped me at the airport, even though I never told the driver where I was going.

On the plane, not sure where it was bound, the in-seat menu had only three options:

Chocolate Beer (Warm)
Chocolate Beer (Cold)
Chocolate Beer (Mood-Based)

I declined.
I was still whole then.

Three years later, at the foot of Mount Fuji, I was selling vintage padlocks to tourists (without a license, sshh).

One rainy afternoon, I saw Jimmy Funk again. Or a version of him. He was carrying the cutest frog umbrella.

“You found me” he declared stoically upon approaching me.

“Is it really you?”

“I’m one of them,” he replied. “Maybe the original. Maybe not.”

“What happened to the frog?”

“The real one or the decoy?”

“Which one did we have?”

Jimmy Funk smiled.
“It’s not really chocolate beer. It’s the memory of who you could’ve been, fermented. Every time you drink it, you make a choice. And every choice leaves something behind.”

“I never drank it,” I said.

He tipped his top hat to me.
“Then you’re probably still whole.”

A pause.
The wind shifted.
His spectacles shimmered like a mirror.
Jimmy stood on his tip-toes and vanished for a split second.

“One more thing,” he added.
“You never actually left the hotel.”

I opened my mouth to speak…
It tasted like chocolate.",1,1765573869.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

We don’t have to share the same interests — you can often become good friends without having any in common.

But I’ll tell you a bit about myself.

I’m from Belarus, though I haven’t lived there for a long time. I’m a homebody rather than a traveler, yet I’ve already moved to several countries — and my way continues.

I love reading books and listening to them as audiobooks. Mostly I go for mystical detectives for kids and adults. I like it when horror is blended with something kind and cozy. By the way, I’m currently writing a book in that same vein. I’m also into psychology. And I love video games — especially indie titles with pixel art. I love autumn and winter, although lately I’ve been living where it’s summer all year round. I adore hot coffee, long walks, swimming in a pool, and swinging on swings.

I’m also can be laconic. Still, I’m always ready to listen and be there for a friend when they need it. But if you’re the type who loves to talk a lot every day, you’ll probably find it hard to chat with me — I can’t always reply.

I love meeting new people. If you’re also looking for someone to chat with now and then — about silly things or about something deep and important — just drop me a message.",2,1765573831.0,newfriends,5,1.0,False

# PURPOSE

I need a Visa or Mastercard w/ no FTF. Travel rewards would also be nice. I'm 19 (soon to be 20) in college full time (and working quite a bit, too) with an avg 5-15% utilization across my cards. I'm taking a gap semester and traveling to NYC in February for 5 days, and several countries across Europe in April.

I have no preference for hotel or airline for rewards- I live in the midwest where the ""closest"" international airports are MSP and ORD (access to Delta, United, American hubs)

One caveat - I'm starting a 12mo accelerated nursing program over the summer and won't be able to travel for the duration of the program, and will have reduced expenses during that period.

I've looked at the Chase Sapphire Preferred, but I'm not quite sure if the AF will bring much value outside of my big trip. Additionally, the SUB is steep for my spending habits but I would be able to reach it by having my parents use it and reimbursing me.

Many topics are up for debate, but I think this is one of the few that we can all agree on the answer to.

​There are so many beautiful Ukrainian women; there’s no doubt about that. Many compare them to models, and men try hard to win them over. But why are they blessed with such charm?​

For the sake of this post, I’ll skip mentioning things like ancestry and genetics. Instead, let me tell you about the things that they do to maintain or improve their appearance.​

**They have healthy diets**

In the US, our Dietary Guidelines highlight fruit, vegetable, whole grain, lean protein, and low-fat dairy consumption. But most of us don’t follow that. We tend to eat a ton of sugar for breakfast and greasy foods, like pizza, chicken, and burgers, for lunch and dinner.​

I’m not saying that Ukrainians are the healthiest. But they’re definitely doing better at following their country’s dietary guidelines. In grand feasts, for example, they always have an astonishing variety of vegetable dishes, such as green cabbage and cucumber salad, borscht, holubtsi, and braised potatoes with mushrooms. They also have a love affair with fermented foods. I was quite surprised when I found out they eat pickled watermelon.​

It’s no wonder they have such clear and radiant skin. Their food isn’t just a part of their culture; it’s also a foundation of their beauty.​

**They invest in femininity**

Let’s be real; many countries have or are downplaying traditional femininity in favor of “more progressive ideals.” But Ukrainian culture emphasizes that femininity is power and dignity, especially in hard times.

In a beauty blog, a first-generation Ukrainian American shared that her grandmother would give her tips on caring for her hands and nails. Her grandmother worked as a housekeeper. Despite the daily grind, she still took time to care for her appearance, even the small things that contribute to it.​

Also, here’s a fun fact: After the war broke out, the beauty industry was the first one to recover. It’s not because Ukrainian women are vain; it’s because self-care is a form of therapy.

​Svitlana Murza, a Ukrainian manicurist, shares these in a journalism publication:

*“I have a client who, before the war, was the chief accountant at a large company. Now she works as a cleaner. And she told me: ‘A manicure and pedicure give me strength. They help me not to lose myself.”*​

*“The beauty space, coffee, clients — it all mattered so much then. We held each other together.”*

​**They carry themselves with confidence**

A woman can be the most attractive person in the room. But if she hides in a corner, people will barely notice her.​

Confidence is what sets beautiful Ukrainian women apart from other women. The way they carry themselves demands that people pay attention. At the same time, their kind of confidence isn’t intimidating; it attracts people to approach them.​

Ukrainian women aren’t just beautiful simply because of their genetics. It’s because they make an effort.

Frontier, take a beat and consider at least one QOL update","After playing for years, I switched to PC. After being on PC, I was surprised at some of the basic features that seem to be low-hanging fruit yet remain untouched.

I'm not asking for the world. I feel like these are elements that could be addressed in a weekend hackathon or even outsourcing to the community:

* Communication chatter - Goat Simulator has more depth and variety in its fake global chat RPG expansion. Goat Simulator. It's text, has negligible impact, and if you added 10 sentences to the game, it would triple what we have today.
* There is more than one song in the future. Seriously. The world did not forget about music in the future. If I can get radio in the wasteland in Fallout, I should be able to get unlicensed classical music from an in-game radio station.
* Can I have a log? Maybe it exists and I just can't find it, but it seems like a simple thing. ""You flew X distance to Y location and offloaded Z amount of Platinum and earned 10 credits. You then jumped through these systems, honked all but one of them, and docked at X station and did absolutely nothing while folding laundry.""
* Bonus points if you let me export it into an .XLS file
* ""Summon all nearby modules"" - We already have the ability to ship modules to a local station/carrier. It seems like a bulk-request shouldn't be a heavy lift. I don't want to bring the stuff I left in Colonia (which I wouldn't have left there if this feature existed), but I would love to bring the stuff that's handing out in scattered ports in the bubble.
* ""Buy this ship and send it to this carrier/dock for me to outfit"". We can summon ships to us after the fact. Why can't we send them ahead?
* Give me 5 things to do in a port, on foot, that makes a port more than a glorified menu. Let me play a slot machine or bet on buckeyball to earn/lose credits. Let me play solitaire or freecell while enjoying a coffee while looking at the view out the window. Give me a game of darts, or arcade games, or other distractions. These are low-effort asks using existing mechanics, but amplify the value/possibilities of being on foot in nearly-identical stations.
* (Bigger ask) Player tracking - In the game Gems of War, you have the ability to invite people to track your player status. You have to permit access, but when you do, you have details on their activities, inventory, and achievements. Frontier has this information. Simply exposing it, with permission from the pilot, would open a world of supplemental services.

I'll stop here. I enjoy what Frontier is doing. I just think there are some glaring gaps that are relatively easy to fill but aren't making it above the fold in the development backlog. I guarantee these will be appreciated, used, and quite possibly monetized with current and future customers.",32,1765573232.0,EliteDangerous,25,0.8,False

“If the air smells like gas… you are already too late.”

\---

🩸 Story

I — The Quiet Boy

There are names you whisper.

Stories you avoid telling.

Not because of monsters… but because of what a wounded human being can become.

Before the world knew him as Devouring Gentleman, he was just a boy—

Dante Martin Moretti, born in Rome on November 7th, 1997.

A thin, quiet child with restless eyes.

Sensitive. Too sensitive for a world that didn’t know how to hold him.

When Dante was nine, his father died.

His mother broke soon after—collapsing into alcohol, drugs, and violent grief.

The home that once smelled of warm bread and coffee slowly turned into a cage of smoke, spilled liquor, and rage.

Dante became the punching bag of everything she couldn’t control.

He learned to breathe quietly.

To walk lightly.

To shrink.

As if disappearing could save him.

But disappearing didn’t work at school.

\---

II — Circle of Hell

Dante was bullied—eight boys who seemed to take delight in tearing him apart.

Later, they became nine, when his best friend joined them after discovering Dante had feelings for him.

Disgust. Betrayal.

It scarred Dante deeper than any blade.

After that, he broke.

He began harming himself, looking for a pain that belonged only to him.

When the bullies found out he liked boys, everything got worse.

They beat him for hours.

They tried to blind his right eye.

They drowned him in a toilet until he nearly stopped breathing.

He lost control.

He lost hope.

\---

III — The Black Cat

At sixteen, Dante found a wounded black kitten—

a fragile creature that, for once, didn’t fear him.

He cared for it in secret, away from his mother and the bullies.

That stray became his only reason to keep going.

Until the day he found it dead.

Its body sliced open.

Its blood smeared on the pavement, forming a message:

“Here’s a little gift for you, you fucking freak.”

Something snapped.

But not sadness.

Not despair.

Silence.

The kind of silence that comes before an explosion.

For Dante, that explosion would be made of gas.

\---

IV — Birth of a Monster

Dante planned.

Coldly.

Quietly.

Precisely.

Knives first.

Then gas bombs he learned to assemble alone in his room while his mother screamed drunkenly outside.

One night, he left home with a single purpose:

They all had to die.

No one knows the details.

Just fragments.

Muffled screams.

Hissing gas.

Smoke curling through the halls.

And nine disappearances that the police never solved.

When Dante returned home, his mother found him — and what he had done.

What happened next is unknown.

Only that the name Moretti silently vanished from Rome’s phone book after that night.

And a new name started spreading across obscure forums and failed police reports:

Devouring Gentleman.

\---

V — The Operator’s Call

At eighteen, Dante vanished from the world.

Cameras recorded him walking into a forest near Rome, followed by a tall, pale, faceless figure:

Slenderman.

They say he offered Dante purpose.

And Dante accepted instantly.

He became a proxy—

a phantom with knives, gas bombs, and a gas mask hiding the last shards of his humanity.

He kills only those he considers ""bad.""

Sometimes he leaves handwritten notes.

Sometimes only the smell of gas.

Some claim a black cat walks beside him—

a spirit guiding its broken protector.

Unfortunately the ikea made drawers for the Elvarli are no longer sold in US stores.

I've been trying to find a way to add storage, I'm not a wood worker so would need to find pre-fab cabinets to match the dimensions. Based on the measurements on ikea.com an Elvarli shelf is Width: 31 1/2 "" Depth: 20 1/8 ""

I have found a couple cabinets with equal or slightly smaller dimensions on wayfair, see below:

I (female 31) have a room mate well call kevin (male 36) whose been living with me a year and a half due to having nowhere else to go and no friends or family. The only friend he did have was my ex whose the father of my son Greg (male 36) which is how Kevin came to stay at my place because he was originally staying with Greg at his place with Greg's other 3 kids and thats a whole other story. 
So Kevin and I discussed rent etc he gives me 300 a month because thats all he can afford. He doesnt pitch towards groceries or bills etc. A couple months after he moved in him and I grew close and we got into a relationship which was good for the first 6 months. It started going bad because he got entitled to my money. Some examples are, I got a lump sum of money about 5 grand, and I spent about 2 thousand on groceries things that are needed for the house. Gave Kevin some money for video games that he asked for, bought birthday presents for my daughter and his son, paid off all bills and debts etc. We'll when rent was due he shorted me money because I needed to be punished for not spending the money how he wanted, and since I can spend money on whatever he decided hed spend his on whatever. 
Another example was him and I got into an argument and he threw it in my face that he shouldn't have to smoke the cheap cigarettes anymore that I should've figured things out so he can get good smokes and weed that if I didnt spend my money on making my kids happy I could afford it for him. 
Other examples are him only drinking an expensive brand of coffee and only certain foods so id have to supply that. 
When our car broke down I was expected to pay for his Ubers. Including in the summer when he could've biked with the carriage thing. If I didnt pay for the Uber hed cancel on his son.
That I need to support his son cause he cant, so buying his son what his son eats and toys etc. 
Both of my kids are handicapable my son has severe autism and is non verbal and my daughter has fasd and a autism, but shes verbal. This is where things ended. Him and I would constantly get into arguments because I refused to follow his ""orders"" on how to parent my daughter. There was no issues with how I patented my son but he wanted me to be harder on my daughter and essentially tell the therapists screw you, that they didnt know what they were talking about l blah blah blah. Hes the smartest person in the world and a perfect parent apparently. There's alot of other issues as well like he would make comments about how I wasnt that great of a mom compared to how he is as a parent and when my mom was talking about how I was smart in school he made a comment I dont know about that. Etc stuff like that. Or if someone said what I made was really good hed say it was ok could use such and such more. Yet he never cooked.
My mom's issue with him is he doesnt do anything. He doesnt help out around the house he doesnt cook and doesnt cut the grass and now that snows here he refuses to shovel. He sits in his room all day playing video games. We broke up about 5 months ago due to the above issues. I said that he could continue to stay here but stuff needed to change. Nothings changed, and hes on the lease cause we had to move from our old place so I cant just throw him out. Also the rent from 2 thousand to 2700 cause of the move and now both my mom and I are strapped as we're taking on the financial burden for rent bills groceries etc he refuses to do anything to bring in more money to help and has said we can figure it out. 
Now onto the bottle. My mom is an alcoholic. So if theres alcohol sitting out she'll drink it. Everyone knows this, which is why we dont buy alcohol very often because she'll drink it. Shes fine if its not around but if it is she'll drink it and then replace it later, etc. 
Well I bought him a bottle of bumbu and he left it in the kitchen on a shelf. The other day he asked where the bottle went my mom said oh I drank it I'll replace it sorry. I snapped at my mom for drinking the bottle. Since then Kevin's been kind of hostile and they've been fighting and im now caught in the middle. On one hand I get his bottle that I bought was drank and thats shitty. On the other hand my mom goes above and beyond in the house helping me with the kids, cleaning and financially while he sits on his butt gaming all day. So would I be the ahole if I didnt replace the bottle. ",2,1765573154.0,okstorytime,2,1.0,False

1pl2znj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pl2znj,Anyone to help me with this novel?: BETRAYAL AND SWEET REVENGE.,"Chapter 1

The key turned silently in the lock, just as I'd planned. Three days early from the Singapore conference—I'd wanted to surprise Matthew with his favorite takeout from that little Italian place on Fifth Street. The house felt different the moment I stepped inside, charged with an energy that made my skin prickle. A woman's laughter drifted down from upstairs, light and musical. Not mine. My briefcase slipped from numb fingers, hitting the marble floor with a sharp crack that echoed through the foyer. The sound should have alerted them, but the laughter continued, now joined by Matthew's deeper chuckle—the one he used to reserve for me during our lazy Sunday mornings. I climbed the stairs on autopilot, each step deliberate despite the tremor in my legs. The bedroom door stood ajar, and through the gap, I saw them. Matthew's back, the familiar constellation of freckles across his shoulders that I'd traced countless times during our eight years together. But beneath him wasn't me—it was Clare, her auburn hair spread across my Egyptian cotton pillowcase like spilled wine. Her legs wrapped around his waist with an intimacy that spoke of practice, of repetition. This wasn't their first time. The realization hit like ice water in my veins. Clare's manicured nails—the same coral shade she'd helped me pick last month—raked down his back as she arched beneath him. ""God, I've missed this,"" Matthew groaned against her throat, his voice thick with desire I hadn't heard directed at me in months. ""Victoria's always so tired lately, so distant. You make me feel alive again."" Clare's response was a breathless whisper that carried clearly through the silence: ""I love you, Matthew. I've loved you for so long, watching you with her, wishing..."" The words sliced through me with surgical precision. My best friend since college. The woman who'd held my hand through both failed IVF cycles, who'd brought me soup when the hormone treatments left me bedridden, who'd listened to me cry about my fears that Matthew was pulling away. She'd been there for every moment of my breakdown, offering comfort while secretly coveting what was mine. I should have stormed in. Should have screamed, thrown things, demanded explanations. Instead, I found myself backing away from the door, my strategic mind clicking into gear like a computer booting up. The betrayal was complete—husband and best friend, the two people I'd trusted most in the world, tangled together in the bed where I'd spent sleepless nights worrying about our marriage. Downstairs, I retrieved my briefcase with mechanical precision. My hands didn't shake as I pulled out my phone and scrolled to Sarah Chen's contact. My divorce attorney—we'd worked together on corporate restructuring deals, and I knew her reputation for leaving nothing on the table. ""Sarah? It's Victoria Murray. I need to retain your services for a personal matter. How quickly can we meet?"" The next morning, I sat in my car outside the electronics store, engine running as I stared at the small shopping bag beside me. Inside: three wireless cameras, motion-activated, with cloud storage capability. The same technology we used for corporate security assessments, now repurposed for documenting the destruction of my marriage. Matthew had already left for his morning run—a routine I'd memorized over years of shared mornings. Clare would arrive within the hour; I'd seen the pattern emerging over the past few weeks, though I'd been too naive to recognize it then. Her Tuesday ""yoga classes"" that coincidentally aligned with my business trips. The way she'd started asking about my travel schedule with casual interest that now felt calculating. The house welcomed me back like a co-conspirator. I moved through rooms that had once felt like home, now transformed into a crime scene requiring documentation. The first camera went in the living room, positioned behind a decorative vase with a clear view of the couch where they'd probably started their seduction. The second in our bedroom, hidden within the bookshelf Matthew never touched—ironic, since he was about to become the star of his own surveillance footage. The third camera I saved for the kitchen, where Clare would inevitably make herself coffee using the machine I'd bought, drinking from mugs that had been wedding gifts. Every detail would be captured, every intimate gesture preserved as evidence for the divorce proceedings that would strip Matthew of everything he thought he could keep. As I positioned the final device, my reflection caught in the chrome surface of the refrigerator. The woman staring back looked composed, professional—but her eyes held something new. Not just pain, but purpose. The strategic planner in me had taken control, channeling betrayal into methodology. Matthew wanted to feel alive again? I'd show him exactly what being alive could cost.
Chapter 2

Three weeks after installing the cameras, I sat across from Sarah Chen in her glass-walled conference room, watching her flip through a file thick enough to choke on. The evidence had accumulated beautifully—hours of footage, timestamped and cataloged with the same precision I brought to corporate presentations. ""This is comprehensive,"" Sarah said, her voice carrying the satisfaction of a predator who'd just spotted wounded prey. ""Adultery, violation of marital trust, and the financial records you've provided show he's been using joint funds for his... extracurricular activities. Hotels, dinners, gifts that certainly weren't for you."" I traced my finger along the mahogany table's grain, a habit that surfaced when I was calculating outcomes. ""What's our position?"" ""Dominant."" Sarah's smile was sharp as a blade. ""California's a no-fault state, but adultery still influences asset division when marital funds are misused. Combined with your higher earning potential and the fact that he's been depleting joint accounts..."" She leaned back in her chair. ""We can secure seventy percent of marital assets, maybe more."" The number should have brought satisfaction, but all I felt was the cold efficiency of a machine processing data. Matthew would lose the house, most of his investments, even the vintage wine collection his father had left him. By the time we finished, he'd have just enough to start over—if he was careful. ""Initiate proceedings,"" I said, my voice steady as a surgeon's hand. ""I want this finished before he realizes what's happening."" Two days later, Matthew sat in our kitchen—soon to be my kitchen—staring at the divorce papers with the expression of a man who'd just watched his world catch fire. His coffee had gone cold an hour ago, but his hands remained wrapped around the mug like it was the only solid thing left in his universe. ""Victoria, we can work through this,"" he said, his voice cracking on my name. ""I know I made mistakes, but we can go to counseling, we can—"" ""Seventy-two percent,"" I interrupted, settling into the chair across from him with my own coffee, steam rising between us like a barrier. ""That's what I'm taking. The house, the investment portfolio, the business accounts. You get to keep your car and enough to rent a nice apartment."" His face drained of color. ""You can't be serious. This is our life, everything we built together—"" ""Everything I built,"" I corrected, my tone as measured as a metronome. ""While you were building something else entirely with Clare."" The name hit him like a physical blow. His shoulders sagged, and for a moment, I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. ""How long have you known?"" he whispered. ""Long enough."" I stood, smoothing my skirt with practiced composure. ""Sign the papers, Matthew. Your lawyer will explain why fighting this would be... unwise."" That evening, I sat in my home office with a glass of wine and my laptop, ready for phase two. Clare's social media profiles sprawled across my screen like an open book, each post a breadcrumb leading me deeper into her psyche. Her Instagram revealed the usual curated perfection—yoga poses, artisanal coffee, inspirational quotes about self-love. But it was the older posts that interested me, the ones she'd forgotten to delete. College photos from eight years ago showed a younger Clare at parties, always hovering near one particular man. Dark hair, striking features, confident smile. The tags identified him: Grant Lawrence. In every photo where he appeared, Clare positioned herself within his orbit—never quite touching, but always close enough to suggest intimacy that the body language clearly contradicted. I scrolled through years of digital obsession. Photos of Grant at business events where Clare had somehow secured invitations. Screenshots of his LinkedIn updates, liked within minutes of posting. Comments on his rare social media posts that were just a little too eager, too familiar for someone who was supposedly just an old college acquaintance. The pattern painted a picture of unrequited longing stretched across nearly a decade. Clare had been in love with Grant Lawrence long before she'd settled for stealing my husband. I opened a new browser tab and searched for Grant's current information. Lawrence Holdings, a successful investment firm. Thirty-four years old, never married. And according to a recent interview in Business Weekly, he maintained a routine as predictable as clockwork. ""I believe in consistency,"" he'd told the reporter. ""Every Thursday evening, you'll find me at The Metropolitan on Fifth Street. Same booth, same drink. It's where I do my best thinking."" I leaned back in my chair, wine warming my throat as the pieces clicked into place. Clare's obsession would be her weakness, and Grant Lawrence would be my weapon. The man she'd dreamed about for years, sitting alone every Thursday night, completely unaware that he was about to become the centerpiece of a very personal war. The Metropolitan. Thursday evenings. Corner booth. I raised my glass in a silent toast to the photograph of Grant on my screen. ""Nice to meet you, Mr. Lawrence. I think we're going to be very good friends.""
Chapter 3

The Metropolitan buzzed with Thursday evening energy as I stepped through its mahogany doors at precisely eight-fifteen. Three weeks of reconnaissance had taught me Grant Lawrence's patterns with mathematical precision—he arrived at eight, ordered his usual Macallan 18, and claimed the corner booth that offered a perfect view of the entrance while maintaining privacy. I'd spent an hour perfecting my appearance, selecting a midnight blue dress that hugged my curves without appearing desperate, paired with heels that added just enough height to command attention. My hair fell in soft waves over one shoulder, and I'd chosen a lipstick shade that suggested confidence rather than seduction. Everything calculated to appear effortless. The hostess led me toward the bar, but I already knew exactly where my target sat. Grant Lawrence occupied his usual corner booth, a crystal tumbler of amber liquid catching the low light as he reviewed documents spread across the table. Dark hair slightly tousled, sharp jawline, and those penetrating eyes that had captivated Clare for nearly a decade. He was more striking in person than his photos suggested—the kind of masculine presence that commanded rooms without effort. I positioned myself at the bar with deliberate precision, angling my body so he'd have a perfect view of my profile while I appeared completely absorbed in my wine selection. The bartender approached with professional warmth, and I ordered a glass of their finest Bordeaux, my voice carrying just enough to reach the corner booth. ""Excellent choice,"" came a deep voice from behind me, rich with genuine appreciation rather than practiced charm. ""The 2015 vintage has remarkable complexity."" I turned slowly, preparing to feign surprise at the interruption, but the words died on my lips when I met Grant's gaze. There was no confusion in those dark eyes, no polite uncertainty of a stranger making conversation. Instead, I saw recognition—clear, immediate, and unsettling. ""Victoria Murray,"" he said, extending his hand with a smile that reached his eyes. ""I was hoping you'd finally make it here."" My carefully rehearsed surprise crumbled. ""I'm sorry, do we know each other?"" ""Not officially."" He gestured toward his booth with easy confidence. ""But I've been following your work at Meridian Strategic for some time. Your analysis of the Henderson merger was brilliant—you saw the cultural integration issues that everyone else missed."" This wasn't the script I'd written. Grant Lawrence was supposed to be an unsuspecting mark, drawn in by calculated charm and strategic positioning. Instead, he spoke with the authority of someone who'd done his own research, who'd been waiting for this encounter as deliberately as I'd orchestrated it. ""You read industry publications?"" I asked, accepting his invitation and sliding into the booth across from him. ""I read everything."" His smile turned knowing. ""Especially when it involves someone as intriguing as you."" The wine arrived, and Grant raised his glass in a toast. ""To unexpected encounters that feel remarkably like destiny."" Destiny. The word sent an unwelcome flutter through my chest, disrupting the cold calculation I'd wrapped around myself like armor. This man was supposed to be a weapon in my revenge against Clare, not someone who looked at me like I was the most fascinating puzzle he'd ever encountered. ""So,"" I said, regaining my composure and leaning forward slightly, ""what brings a successful investment manager to the same bar every Thursday night?"" ""Consistency breeds opportunity."" His fingers traced the rim of his glass, a gesture that seemed unconscious yet somehow intimate. ""I've found that the most important meetings happen when you're not actively seeking them."" The conversation flowed with unexpected ease. Grant possessed the rare ability to listen completely, asking questions that revealed genuine interest rather than polite social engagement. When I mentioned my recent divorce—a carefully deployed vulnerability meant to establish my availability—his expression shifted to something deeper than sympathy. ""Betrayal changes us,"" he said quietly. ""The question is whether we let it make us smaller or use it to become more strategic."" The word 'strategic' on his lips sent heat spiraling through me. He understood the game, recognized the player I'd become. But instead of judgment, I saw appreciation in his eyes—as if my calculated nature was exactly what drew him to me. ""And which did you choose?"" I asked, my voice softer than intended. ""I'm still deciding."" His hand moved across the table, fingers brushing mine with deliberate intent. ""Though I'm beginning to think the right partnership might change everything."" The touch sent electricity shooting up my arm, and for a dangerous moment, I forgot this was supposed to be an act. Grant's thumb traced across my knuckles with a tenderness that felt genuine, and when he suggested we continue our conversation somewhere more private, my 'yes' came without calculation. His penthouse overlooked the city like a kingdom, floor-to-ceiling windows revealing the glittering landscape below. But I barely noticed the view—my attention was consumed by the man who moved through the space with quiet confidence, pouring wine with the same focused attention he'd given our conversation. ""You're not what I expected,"" I admitted, accepting the glass he offered. ""What did you expect?"" His question carried weight, as if he already knew the answer. I should have deflected, maintained the facade, but something in his steady gaze demanded honesty. ""Someone easier to manipulate."" Grant's laugh was rich and genuine. ""Victoria, I've been waiting three months for you to walk into that bar. Did you really think this was coincidence?"" The admission should have alarmed me, should have triggered every strategic instinct I possessed. Instead, it sent desire pooling low in my belly, hot and unexpected. This man had orchestrated our meeting as carefully as I had, which meant we were both players in a game whose rules were still being written. When he stepped closer, wine forgotten on the counter, I didn't retreat. His hand cupped my face with reverent gentleness, thumb tracing my cheekbone as if I were something precious rather than a weapon in someone else's war. ""Tell me this isn't just strategy,"" he whispered against my lips. For the first time in months, I answered with complete honesty: ""I don't know anymore."" His kiss was patient fire, building slowly until my carefully constructed walls began to crumble. And as Grant Lawrence carried me toward his bedroom, I realized my perfect revenge plot had just become infinitely more complicated.",0,1765573112.0,romancenovels,3,0.5,False

It’s now Friday and the pile is cooler at the center than the air temperature.

1pl2vgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pl2vgi/stop_looking_for_the_paranormal/,Stop Looking For The Paranormal,"Authors note: I posted this awhile back in the first creepcast submission sub, and I meant to poster it here properly the other day. A lot of stuff has happened since I first wrote and submitted this entry, hopefully I'll be able to explain more with the next entry I post.

Hello, I don't know how to properly explain this, but I have an addiction. I know how that sounds, but what I say is different from what most people say when they have an addiction though, they'll usually go to a program or get help, or just say screw it and continue to spiral into their vices. I fall somewhere in between. My addiction runs deep, since I was a kid with a neglectful/workaholic parent and too much free time on the internet in the early 2000's. Before I continue my name is Corey, and my path of cryptids and things that went bump in the night started with unrestricted internet access in about 2010 with two very important pieces of media, one being a thick book hidden away in my elementary school library called ""Weird Ohio”, and when I came across a video series called Marble Hornets. 

To make a long story short of it, I was hooked. I watched every video from the series, listened to every creepypasta I could get my hands on, read up on scps  and even convinced my blue collar father to buy me one of those at the time seventy dollar handheld cam-recorders so I could make videos in my neighborhood. All of this is to help you get an understanding of where I'm coming from and how these communities I interacted with helped to shape me as I grew up.

Growing up in Ohio as a “creepypasta kid”, it was surprising just how little I was bullied for it back in the day, but that could be chalked up to either my downplaying it and masking my “weirder” interests with things like halo and left 4 dead, or that the town I grew up in was pretty weird already(p.s, if you're ever in Ohio and find yourself in Tuscarawas County, go visit the warlocks grave). But for all my oddities and interests, it led me to a small encounter when I was eleven years old. 

It started innocent enough, I was on my winter break and as a 5th grader with too much social media influence and no supervision, I did what I assumed almost no one else my age was doing and grabbed an oversized hoodie, a nerf blaster, and my camera before making my way out the door and into the snow covered neighborhood to “hunt for creepypastas”. I should clarify it right now, I was a child. Barely double digits and as much as I cringe to myself as I write this I want to effectively explain why little moments like these have led to some of the decisions I made years later down the line. Around my house was a river with trees that I used as a makeshift hideout during nerf battles with my friends, and a road that went up a wooded hill into a hiking trail that everyone in my neighborhood believed to be home to several scary characters, like the Seed Eater and Slenderman himself.

With my camera in hand and an empty nerf gun, I first trekked through the hard snow towards the river, making sure the Rake or another scary entity hadn't snuck in to steal any of my rotting wooden chairs or secret stash of darts, not really considering they would have no use for either of those things. Walking back towards my house and patrolling the streets I found myself standing at the base of the hill, staring up into the snow covered trees that seemed so intimidating at my young age, I flipped open the screen to my camera and started to record myself going up the hill.


Now, despite this being my “first” encounter with something I couldn't really explain, I haven't the clearest memory of how I got so lost and turned around up there, only that I remember being on my knees in the snow as I desperately tried to wipe snot off my face as I cried. That's when I saw them, though. In-between the tears and fear of being lost I can remember looking up and just about twenty to thirty feet down the hill stood three individuals.

They were blurry, I remember that, but that could have been because of the tears that clouded my vision. I can also remember that despite the distance between me and them, their voices called out in a whisper. Do you ever remember the feeling of having a parent talk softly as you want to sleep? It was like that. Their voices were soft and comforting, and by the time I had stopped crying I had found myself at the start of the trail, my face wiped of snot and tears, and my camera in my hand. I can remember going back home and not even realizing I was out for most of the day, opening the screen door and greeted with the angered voice of my father saying it was dinnertime, and that he had looked for me everywhere in the neighborhood. I was too scared to tell him what happened, so I remember lying and saying I was at “the new kids house”.

I don't remember what became of that camera, as I've moved to 3 different states since then. Looking back on it now, it seemed more likely it was a case of “Third Man Syndrome”, if you're unfamiliar with it, it's when missing people or people in situations like a car wreck report a voice or person guiding and helping them to safety. Though whether that was the case or not, it was my first taste of something unusual happening to me.

All of that is to say, despite the small experiences I had growing up, I know for sure that what happened around my eighteenth birthday was supernatural in nature.

To help set the scene, it was early June in 2020 and I was living in a small town in Southern Colorado, which as a then freshly graduated high-schooler the world pandemic put a bit of a hold on things like college. What didn't get put on hold though was the military, which is where I introduce you to my friends Morgan, Jade, Casey and Henry. Morgan, Henry and Jade were enlisting into the Marines, while Casey was going into the navy, which was kinda ironic given that I was 6 '1, and he had a good three inches on me, though with how lanky he was and the way he kept his blond hair short, he fit right in.

Another small note to add, with all of our shared interests, each of us had had some sort of experience with the paranormal.

Ever since the start of my senior year, me and my friends had formed a pretty tight bond, so much so that we would spend the weekends at Henry's, with Saturday for PT(Physical Training), coffee from a small plant shop, and then gaming or whatever shenanigans that lasted until Sunday evening when we all went home. The reason I explain this is that one Saturday Casey finally found out his ship date, and it was before my 18th birthday. Now, being the youngest of my friend group by only a few months meant I was the “kid” of the group, despite the fact that Henry's birthday was two months ago. Casey, being the big macho man he had been puffing himself up to be, decided that we should celebrate before he heads out, and as such made a plan for the weekend of the 12th as the time to celebrate.

When the day arrived, I remember being in my room watching as the clock on my phone ticked the minutes by, my futon groaning as the cheap and slightly broken metal frame held me up as i had eagerly awaited a message back from my friends, trying my hardest not to dwell on the self-conscious feelings of being ignored that came with getting no response. It was about 5:30ish when I finally got a knock on the door to my house, and before I realized I was on my feet, shoes on and bag at the ready as I swung the door open and–

*BOOM*

A loud bang in my face threw me off, causing me to take a step back as I flailed my arms outward as multi-colored paper covered my body. ""Surprise!"" Came Morgan's voice, his eyes shining with excitement as he handed me a small party popper full of confetti and laughed.”You dick, my ears are ringing again” I grumbled out, though I couldn't be upset for long, instead I smiled and pulled him into a hug before grabbing my keys, and locking the front door behind me as I went down the gravel road towards the sedan that Henry drove.

“Happy birthday, bitch” he called out as his window rolled down, a large smile on his face as his sunglasses reflected the summer sun as I approached and got in the front passenger side, aux cord handed to me, as was tradition for the birthday person, and we took off down the road.


I lived on the edge of the city limits then, in a small trailer that my dad rented from his buddy, so it was a nice seven to nine minutes of tunes and talking about what we were planning for the weekend when Henry turned down the music. “We're gonna have to make a stop at the store to grab a few things, but Casey is gonna meet us there and keep you company” “keep me company? What, am I a child?” I joked, when Morgan nodded his head and jokingly replied “have you met yourself? It's a surprise you haven't been banned from all the stupid stuff you do”.

The store itself was nothing too eventful, so I'll spare it here, the only relevant information to take is that I was kept distracted in the lego section looking for a new set to build with everyone(I settled.on one of the mega construx halo sets) and was told stay inside the store until they got everything packed away. After finally getting back to the car, we all packed into the sedan, music blaring as we drove out of the town towards Henry's house since he lived on some nice farm property, perfect for dicking around in his woods or going to the makeshift range he set up to fire off some guns.

Pulling up to his house, I was immediately escorted inside, moving through the kitchen, the living room and down the hall towards Henry's bedroom, where I was told to stay until everything was set up. Not that I minded, in fact I was elated, the feeling of having a good group of friends that cared enough to plan the day out on your behalf is a feeling that sits nice and warm on the soul. While I waited, scrolling on my phone the bedroom doors opened and I was greeted to the sight of our fifth friend in the group who hadn't been with Casey at the store, Jade.

Jade was an…. interesting friend, with green eyes, shaggy ginger hair and baggy clothes would have thrown anyone off to the idea of him training to be in the Marines. He was the only one in my friend group to not have any belief or interest in the paranormal, always believing in the science of the world and even dismissing religion to a degree.

“Yo, happy birthday man” he greeted, his short stature waltzing into the room and enveloping me with a hug. “Heyo, thanks man” I responded back, watching as he sat next to me on the bed and offered me a cool soda he had produced from his back pocket.

 “You gonna tell me what they got planned out there?” “No way man, I was sworn to secrecy and to keep you here til they're done”. That was fine, I grabbed my overnight bag and pulled out the Xbox I brought with me, hooking it up quickly as the two of us settled on playing some halo together, when the door was pushed open and there in his sleeveless shirt and cargo pants, built like he was already in the military stood Henry. 

What followed was an unsettling amount of silence, followed by him letting out a large belch, extending his arm outward to point at me followed by another “bitch”.

I laughed, scooting over and handing him another controller as we played through the multi-player for a few matches when Henry's phone went off, and he motioned for us to follow. Making our way through the house and onto his front porch, I saw Morgan standing off to the side with something behind his back and Casey as they turned their attention to me and pointed into the entrance of woods that occupied Henry's property.

“We set up something in the woods for ya, but you'll probably need this” Morgan explained, handing me a metal pipe from Henry's scrap pile, to which Casey made a confused face. “Dude, you're making it sound like we're gonna kill him in the woods.” I agreed and laughed, stepping off the porch as they followed behind, and following into the makeshift path as we entered.


The woods of his property were interesting, old decaying rv homes were nested deeper into the property, the woods themselves being about four acres large, along with at least another two acres of tall grass that had been dug into for his makeshift range, and finally, no neighbors for at least 10 miles. All of this to say, as I stepped into the woods it felt off. This wasn't the first time this happened to me, as a matter of fact Henry and I have already had some weird encounters on his property(that's another set of stories for another day). This was similar, like a weight clamped around my ankles as the feeling of being watched had pulled me from my excitement, my eyes narrowing as I scanned between the trees in search of something, when I saw it.

Hanging from a rather tall branch, in a mixture of yellow and green, was a pinata. It swayed slightly, as if it was just hung up and the remaining momentum caused its movement. “Surprise!” They all yelled behind me, and I felt a warmth flow through me as I kept my eyes forward, that tense feeling fading immediately.


The rest of the evening was very fun and entertaining, filled with profanities at each other as we played video games, built the halo set I had acquired, and laughing so hard that I almost threw up when Henry decided to do the hilarious bit that was taking a bite out of the number eight candle from the store bought cake Morgan had gotten me.

The sun had fallen, and darkness had settled over the property when I had a brilliant idea. “Yall wanna play scp?” I had asked innocently enough. Watching the living room we had all settled into as everyone looked up, then to each other, as everyone had lit up with interest. “Are we gonna be using actual BB rounds?” Casey asked, and when I nodded my head in response, his smile grew. Quickly everyone had changed into the spare airsoft gear Henry had, and if you didn't play pretend on the playground with the weird kids (i.e me), lemme give the most brief rundown.

One person dresses up as a “monster/scp”, usually with a mask or whatever Halloween costume you have laying around, while the others dress as a scientist and guards. The game itself is simple. The monster/scp hides and stalks the guards and scientist, trying to “kill” them. Meanwhile the guards and scientist have to “capture” the monster/scp, usually by chasing and grabbing them. The monster wins by killing the guards, and the scientist wins by capturing the monster. 

With the proper context, you could see why a bunch of teens that love scary things would get excited. I went first, donning a plague leather doctor mask as well as a black oversized oversized hoodie to help me blend in with the shadows and went out into the darkness to prepare for my scares as a monster. This went completely wrong as in less than a minute after everyone stepped out, the glass lens of my mask gave me away as a flashlight shined in my direction, and they promptly lit me up until I was on the ground in pain, which in hindsight was very funny.

Next up was Henry, who after requesting we stand in his bedroom, finally said he was ready and we were able to step out. What greeted us was a completely dark household. Quickly we got into formation, with Jade being the scientist for the round, me and Morgan took point in the front as Casey, being the tallest of our group, stayed with Jade in the back as we slowly walked through the home with our flashlights being the only light source. Slowly we cleared each room, checking around corners and occasionally getting tense when we heard a noise like a floorboard creaking, or tapping on glass. Making our way toward the living room we saw the door wide open, the front porch light flickering as Henry had deliberately left it open, the summer chill blowing in as we cautiously approached. 

Despite the layered clothing, a breeze had picked up, the chills immediately piercing through my clothing and causing me to adjust my helmet as I let out a shudder. “he could be anywhere. Look around but don't go too far” Jade's voice had cut through the silence, and with a bit more confidence me and Morgan stepped off the porch and onto the gravel driveway, with Jade and Casey following behind us.

Having nothing but the muffled sound of feet pressing against gravel, combined with the gentle yet persistent summer breeze in the darkness of a cloudly full moon night could put anyone on edge, which made the game all the more exciting. We kept moving, my weapon trained on the dark forest path as the helmet mounted flashlight barely illuminated my surroundings, when I heard a scream echo into the night, followed by an airsoft gun firing as Casey yelled “contact! He's in the trees!”. Quickly I looked up, and jumping from one tree to another was Henry, dressed in a purple morphsuit adorned with a hairy zombie mask.

“F-FUCK!” “What the hell!” me and Morgan shouted over each other, firing into the tops of the trees as branches cracked and rustled, the blur of grey and purple mixing with the foliage as he took off.

“Nope, nope I'm not doing this!” Casey had called out, and I turned to see he had somehow fallen onto his back, and was currently being helped up. “Pussy!” Henry's voice called from the darkness, and after a beat of silence Casey let out a huff and walked back inside. That caused us all to laugh, the game paused as Henry came out of the darkness with his mask off and surrendered, claiming he only wanted to scare us. 

Going back inside we turned the lights on and Casey got dressed, choosing to stay out of the game for the rest of the night and sitting on the couch as he claimed a headacheis what made him stop. Which leads us to what happened that night, that to this day, still calls to me. 

It was Jade's turn, and instead of getting a monster costume he chose to keep his layers on, with the addition of one of those World War Two latex gas masks, with large glass eye holes and a long tube. He took Morgan into another room to talk about something as me.and Henry agreed that given the time, this would be our last game for the night. When everyone was ready, Jade stepped out the door and we gave him three minutes to set up, before stepping foot outside into the darkness.

At the time I chalked it up to Henry's previous turn as the monster giving me a tense feeling, but it felt off out there, like it had during my previous experiences in the past. Making our way into the woods, we saw that the makeshift trail had been disturbed, indicating that Jade went that way. Slowly, I took the lead as Henry and Morgan had stayed behind, making our way through as the light from my flashlight caught something reflecting in the distance, one of the old decaying RVs. I motioned for them to follow, making my way to the RV as I quickly threw my gun up onto the roof, and scrambled to get on top of it.

“Corey, what are you doing?” Morgan hissed from the darkness, meanwhile I pulled myself up and grabbed my gun, looking around as i quickly scanned our dark surroundings. The RV was placed in a small tall grass patch between the trees, with the path cutting through it before going back into the treeline about twelve feet away.


“Leverage, this is the only clear patch before going deeper and I'm willing to bet he's out here somewhere” i with certainly, and as Henry finally caught up to us, I heard the sound of bushes rustling and immediately pointed my gun, watching the treeline ahead of us for a few minutes when the sound of a thud, followed by Morgan taking off into the darkness pulled my attention. “Morgan? Where did you go!” I called out, looking to the ground and not seeing Henry initially, I assumed that they left. And just as I was about to get down, I heard more rustling, followed by a figure stepping into the treeline.

“Jade?” I called out, the visor of my helmet conveniently fogging up and causing me to take it off. I set it to the side, letting the flashlight illuminate the direction i was looking in as I focused onto the person, watching as the light caught onto the glass lenses as the clouds had cleared up enough to let the full moon shine, further illuminating his figure and confirming it was Jade. 


I took aim, ready to hit I'm in the arms and call it game, when I felt an wave of melancholy wash over me. Quickly pulling my phone out of the jacket pocket, I checked the time, seeing it had now been 1 in the morning. Call it selfish, but I knew this was the last game of the night, and I wanted to make it last longer. “You know, I didn't think you could be scary in that, but I'm impressed” I joked, trying to get a reaction out of him. Only to be met with silence.

I tried speaking again, recounting the night's and inside jokes our group had, only to be met with his glass lenses reflecting back to me. I then decided to stay quiet, listening as I could hear the rather loud breathing coming from him. “If you're having a hard time breathing in that, you can take it off” I offered, watching as his only reaction was to squat down and take a step forward.

The gun fired before I even acknowledged it, watching as the pellet crashed into the dirt and exploded, a few bits hitting his shoe as both it and the latex mask shined slightly against the combination of moonlight and the helmet light. “No, fuck that. It's been fun but I really need you to respond jade” I called out, my voice wobbling as I turned on my phones flash to give me a better view of my friend, and desperately trying to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach.

Jade just stood there as the light was.cast onto him, his breathing the only sound as he inched closer and I fired another shot st his feet, this time deliberate. “STOP FUCKING WITH ME JADE” I yelled, a swirl of anger and fear clawing at my mind as I aimed to shoot him in at the base of the mask's tube. I know I know, it's not something you should do, but i was scared.

As we stared each other down, the loud muffled breathing being the only noise in the woods around us, another noise pulled our attention, the sound of someone running. While he was still squatting, I watched as Jade darted deeper into the woods in just two strides, and I used the opportunity to getting off the RV's roof as I saw it was Morgan, having ran back and with a smile on his face as I began to speak. “Morgan! I-I saw Jade! He dashed into the trees and-” I was stopped as I felt something poke my chest. Looking down I saw a plastic knife poking me as Morgan spoke. “Surprise! It was a betrayal!” He giggled, and I let out a sigh as I heard noise come from the rv, which was Henry, having been pretending to be dead on the ground and dusted himself off.

“That, was bullshit, by the way.” He huffed out, and after we shared a laugh, grabbed our gear and called out for Jade, claiming him and Morgan won the game and it was time to go back in for the night. Instead of responding, what happened was the three of us spending the next twenty minutes walking around in the woods looking for him, before finally giving up and heading back to the house.



As we entered back into the house, we were greeted to the sight of Jade and Casey, the former of which was already dressed down into his pajamas as he sat at the kitchen table eating some nuggets and the latter was already laying on the couch. “Damn man, you really gave me a scare out there” I complimented as I sat down across from him, watching as Henry and Morgan passed through the house to get dressed for the night.


“I didn't go out.” 


It was said so casually, like he was commenting on how a rock looked or offering what to eat. “That's funny, but seriously it was really scary” I tried to compliment, an odd feeling of irritation forming at his dismissal. “I didn't go out there man” he said again, his eyes meeting mine as he held a neutral expression. 

“Jade-” I started calmly, watching him as I felt my irritation grow irrationally. “I'm trying to say you did good, and I know you were out there, I saw the gas mask”. His facial features hardened, very clearly not liking my tone. “I. Wasn't. Out. There.” I stood up abruptly, ready to argue and yell when Casey's voice spoke up. “dude, he came in like, two minutes after you guys went out. He even made me food.” 

And just like that, every off feeling and sensation from earlier came crashing into me. “What?” I asked, looking to Casey asn Morgan and Henry entered into the room. 

“Dude, I saw and heard you under the rv” Henry claimed, our eyes meeting as we shared a look of worry. “Guys, I didn't go out.” He responded, his tone becoming desperate, looking to the three of us as a desperate demand for belief echoed in his features.

In a swift motion, I turned to lock the front door, peeking out the windows as Henry ran back to his room and Morgan moved to comfort Jade, who had now leaned onto the kitchen table and began to break down. “Fuck, was something out there, like actually?” Casey had asked, watching as Henry had reappeared holding an actual gun, procured from the safe in his room. “We don't know. Let's just stay inside and buddy up for the night, okay?” He responded, looking at me with a stoic expression he wore often when we experienced something paranormal.

His closest neighbor was, like I said, ten miles away, so even if it wasn't something spooky, then it was another person who just happened to wear the same gear Jade had on when he went outside, which one could argue was scarier. Either way, what happened next was actually pretty anticlimactic. The following morning, after we all collectively slept in Henry's small bedroom me, Jade and Henry went out onto the pathway to try and recreate what we saw, as well as check the dirt for potential boot prints, of which there were none.


That was one of last big experiences we had that summer, what we refered to as the “Jadewalker Incident”. I'm twenty-three now, I've fallen out with Casey and Morgan, and me, Henry and Jade have all moved out of state, but lately some more… weird things have happened to me, and I've been feeling that calling once again.


I might share more one day, If this calling gets worse. In the meantime, stop looking for cryptids, monsters and the Paranormal, it's an addiction worse than smoking, and if you get real unlucky, one day, you may just find what you're looking for.

But, in actuality, going through a WARP train trip takes you through another dimension that takes thousands of years. Most passengers deteriorate into immortal insane monsters by the time they get to the other end, but when the train pulls into the station, everyone is reset to the mental and physical state they were when they got on the train by W. Corp agents going in and cleaning up the train with a Singularity.

I’ve drafted my motivation letter but would appreciate feedback on structure and content, especially since the letter has strict prompts and a 2000-character limit.

Requirements ask for:

1. Brief background, personality, and future job goals.
2. Self-criticism: limits in analytical knowledge/skills.
3. How EACH will help achieve goals.
4. Justification for study track preferences (Tartu-Lyon, Tartu-Uppsala, etc.).

My draft:

My chemistry journey began at fourteen, when I ranked first in admission to the technical chemistry programme at IFSC. There I first engaged with research, completing an independent project on amoxicillin adsorption using coffee grounds. Later, during my BSc in Chemistry at UFSC, I spent three years working with functionalized carbon nanotubes, learning microscopy, thermogravimetry, spectroscopy, X‑ray diffraction and other techniques. This experience led to a publication and a project on solar cells, reinforcing my interest in scientific inquiry.

Professionally, I interned at LACESQ (CASAN) and later at AquaVita, analysing water, food and environmental samples. Contact with ISO 17025 and quality systems strengthened my critical thinking, especially when interpreting atypical results. I now work at SAMAE Jaraguá do Sul, analysing water and effluent, and recently completed a specialization in industrial chemical analysis. I see myself as analytical and methodical, motivated by complex problems and process optimisation. In the future, I aim to work as a senior analytical chemist or quality specialist in industry or environmental services.

Despite this background, I recognise limitations. My routine work has restricted my exposure to cutting‑edge instrumental techniques and advanced method development. My theoretical basis in separation science, chemometrics and quality by design still needs consolidation to support more innovative roles.

The EACH programme will help close these gaps through its strong focus on advanced separation methods, instrumental analysis and quality systems in an international environment. I prioritise the Tartu–Lyon track for its industry‑oriented profile and emphasis on method validation and quality assurance, which matches my professional goals. As a second choice, I select Tartu–Uppsala for its strengths in instrumental methods and spectroscopy, which would deepen my understanding of modern analytical techniques.

I’ve run into something interesting while dialing in espresso and I’d love your input.  

I have two baskets for my portafilter. Both are the same size, and I keep everything else identical: grinder, grind setting, coffee, dose, machine, etc. The only variable is the basket itself.  

Here’s what happens:  
- With basket A, a 1:2 ratio takes ~30s.  
- With basket B, the same 1:2 ratio takes ~20s.  
- If I adjust grind setting so basket B hits 1:2 in 30s, then basket A suddenly needs 45+ seconds.  

So clearly the basket design is influencing flow resistance. I can compensate by grinding finer or coarser, but I’m wondering:

If I want to stick to the classic 1:2 ratio in 30s, should I continue with the basket that requires a finer grind, or the one that requires a coarser grind? Which is more likely to lead to better flavor development in the long run?  

I only suspected this yesterday and confirmed today that the basket is the culprit, so I haven’t yet done taste tests. Before I start pulling lots of shots, I’d love to hear your advice.

1pl2pu9,https://i.redd.it/j4jy6mgc5u6g1.png,DCA - DIAMOND HANDS TREASURY (EDUCATIONAL; NFA),"This post is for educational purposes only, it does not constitute financial advice!

What is DCA?

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you consistently buy a set amount of an asset at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly), no matter the price. Instead of trying to time the market, you let consistency do the work.

Think of it like grabbing your favorite coffee every morning — whether it costs $3 or $5, you buy it anyway. Over time, the average price you pay balances out.

💡 Why DCA Works for $LING

\- Reduces Risk: By spreading purchases over time, you avoid the danger of buying all-in at a peak.

\- Removes Emotion: Volatile markets can trigger panic or FOMO. DCA keeps you disciplined and steady.

\- Builds Wealth Gradually: Even small, regular buys compound into significant holdings over time.

\- Accessible to Everyone: You don’t need a huge lump sum — just consistency. Perfect for community members stacking $LING bit by bit.

🚀 Benefits for $LING Holders

\- Ride the Waves: $LING is a community-driven memecoin with lore and rituals. Volatility is part of the journey — DCA helps you embrace it without fear.

\- Long-Term Positioning: As $LING grows (NFTs, airdrops, rituals like Operation: HEAD HUNT), consistent accumulation ensures you’re always part of the story.

\- Community Energy: DCA aligns with the collective vibe — steady, ritualized participation rather than chasing hype.

🔑 Takeaway

DCA isn’t about timing the market — it’s about time in the market. For $LING believers, adopting DCA means you’re not just investing, you’re participating in the mythos consistently, building your stake while the community builds momentum.",1,1765572444.0,MissingDogHead,1,1.0,False

\------------------------------------------------------

**Previous Context:**  
I keep having bags of decaf go stale on me pretty quickly - they lose flavor, crema, body, etc. While this is somewhat expected and I did try vacuum storage and freezing loosely to try and combat it, I never really got a clear picture of how freezing did at retaining flavor because my trials weren't really done with proper storage or side-by-side, like-for-like comparison.

**Why Do This? Isn't Freezing Obviously Better?**  
Well, to be honest, the last time I tried freezing this decaf, I must have done something wrong because it turned out tasting like bland vegetables. Really unpleasant vs on the shelf, but I froze it glass tupperware with a rubber seal so maybe it got compromised. I also didn't single dose, which means that moisture entered the container every time. So this is a chance to improve the storage as well as compare to shelf storage in a more structured way.

**Beans:** [St. Frank Decaf Ubuntu](https://www.saintfrankcoffee.com/products/burundi-ubuntu-decaf) \- my favorite decaf, with a really nice chocolately body when brewed as a ristretto, perfect for me and my wife's daily lattes.

**Recipe & Equipment**: I burned 4-5 shots dialing in the newest bag I got, resulting in a 21g in, 24g out in about 25-30 seconds. This is the same recipe I'll use for every brew, though I may adjust grind if I feel that both samples need it. I'm grinding with a Timemore Sculptor 064S and brewing/steaming with a Bambino Minus.

**Samples:** After dialing in, I had about 178g of coffee left in the bag, enough for roughly 4 shots each with some left over. Less than I thought, but it'll do.

**Storage**: 4 doses will be stored in the valve bag on the shelf. We live in a mild climate but have a poorly insulated old house, so we might be running the heater a bit. The shelf isn't high, so shouldn't really be at over 75F ever. For the freezer, I bought[ these freezer-safe 4oz baby food containers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP56HJN1) that I'll be keeping in a Kirkland freezer-safe ziploc bag. I couldn't use centrifuge tubes because the readily available sizes (50ml) only hold about 16-17g of coffee and I regularly dose much higher than that. I did see 100ml tubes but they looked... sketchy.

**Method**: We usually take about a month (often less, depending on how much we are home) to go through a bag as we also have some other decafs usually and/or are drinking cafs as well, so that's a good timeframe for the experiment. I certainly felt that the longer we kept the decaf the bigger the difference we should see between the two storage methods, and a perceptible difference was important to have an outcome. But also, this is the timeframe we are most likely to use the coffee in, so for our purpose, spreading the 4 shots out over the month made the most sense.

The only strange bit is that we are going on vacation for 2 weeks, so I pushed the last shot out quite a bit for the day after we get back. This has the added benefit of giving an extra long gap to see how the beans develop over time, so I was fine with it.

I am going to test these in 8oz small-ish lattes, which is what we mostly drink. Yes, I know - I should be trying them as straight 'spro for the most clear comparison, but for my household, flavor in milk is the result that matters. Sorry!

Would love to know your thoughts! I'm sure there are many ways I could improve the integrity of the results and the comparison, but for me as long as I get a firm answer on how to store my decaf, I'll be happy. Plus, it's fun!

Hello, everyone. I’m planning a move to New York City in 2026 and would love some perspective from folks who know these neighborhoods well.

Plan A is to renew our lease here in Salt Lake City in May for six months, giving my husband and me (32M / 29M) more time to save and for him to pay down some debt. Plan B is to move in May if a short renewal isn’t offered or if the rent increase feels unreasonable. Either way, our target move window is 2026 with a bit of flexibility. We’ll be visiting NYC in February to scope out neighborhoods, not to sign a lease.

We’ve visited NYC about half a dozen times and absolutely love it. It’s a stark contrast to Utah, which is a change we both really want and feel ready for.

For context, we both work fully remote and our combined gross income is around $200,000 before bonuses. Because we work from home, a true two-bedroom is important so one room can function as a full-time office. The upside is that we don’t need to optimize for a daily commute, though easy train access to Manhattan is still important to us since we enjoy Broadway shows, bars, and spending time in the city.

Before getting into details, I want to acknowledge that we’re very aware of the cost of living in NYC and how much it will increase. We’ve budgeted for higher taxes, groceries, and day-to-day expenses, and we’ve spent enough time in the city to understand and accept the noise, density, and cultural differences. We’re trying to be realistic while also being genuinely excited, and I appreciate respectful and constructive advice.

As mentioned, a two-bedroom is a must. We originally had a budget cap of $4,000, but after reworking our finances we’d strongly prefer to stay closer to $3,500. I’m fully aware that this limits flexibility, especially in more popular or convenient areas, which is why we’ve largely ruled out most of Manhattan and very trendy neighborhoods. Thankfully, working from home gives us more location flexibility.

While finding a neighborhood we enjoy is important, a comfortable apartment ranks slightly higher for us. Ideally, we’re looking for a place with good natural light, A/C, and accommodations for our senior dog. Laundry in-unit would be amazing, but we’re realistic and expect laundry in-building is more likely. We’re open to renovated prewar buildings, not just new construction.

When it comes to neighborhoods, we’re hoping to live somewhere with energy and activity, close to everyday essentials like grocery stores, coffee shops, and movie theaters. We’re generally homebodies but want to be more social after the move. We’re a gay couple and while we know NYC is broadly LGBTQ-friendly, being in or near areas with a visible queer community or easy access to gay bars/clubs would be a big plus.

Based on my research so far, I’ve been focusing mostly outside Manhattan. Here are some of the neighborhoods we’re considering:

Astoria
Astoria feels settled, active, and full of other working professionals and families. The proximity to Manhattan, relatively good value for two-bedroom units, and overall vibe seem like a strong fit. It feels like a place where daily life would be easy while still feeling connected to the city.

Bushwick
Bushwick feels much more creative, artsy, and energetic. I like the idea of being in a neighborhood that encourages us to get out more, and the LGBTQ presence is a big draw. My main hesitation is noise, block-by-block variability, and whether it might feel a bit chaotic for day-to-day life while working from home.

Harlem (especially Central Harlem)
I initially ruled out Manhattan due to cost, but after looking more closely at Harlem, I’m seeing more two-bedroom options in our range than expected. I’m aware of Harlem’s deep history and diversity, and I’m curious how realistic our apartment wish list is here compared to other areas.

Flatbush
Flatbush is lower on the list mainly because when we visited briefly it felt more residential and slower than we’d ideally want, though we didn’t spend much time there. That said, I’m seeing newer buildings, larger units, and even some rent-stabilized options, which makes it worth considering more seriously.

All this to say, I’m hoping to gain some direction and perspective. Based on everything I’ve shared, I’d love to hear from people who have lived in one or more of these neighborhoods about which might be the best fit, which you’d deprioritize, and why. I’m also very open to suggestions for areas I haven’t mentioned, as well as any blocks, streets, or general considerations we should keep in mind when we visit in February.

Thanks in advance for any insight. We really appreciate it.",3,1765571780.0,movingtoNYC,13,1.0,False

(An anime-style, Victorian maid story)","*“19th of October, 1885” The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*


*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

1pl2e0m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pl2e0m,Phin filter as a SOUP and Dripplet Accessories,"Hey! :-)
I was recently experimenting with my Aeropress. Even though I have the Joepresso and love pulling soup / zuppa shots with it, I recently got the filter flow control cap and wanted to play around with that. My goal was to find something suitable that can be used as a puck / dispersion screen so that the grounds stay as a puck while adding the water. Online I didnt really find something that would fit when inserted from the top of the AP (apart of using just a normal AP paper filter and tamp it with your plunger). So I started experimenting with my Vietnamese coffee brewer (phin filter) that my sister brought from Vietnam couple of years ago. Coincidentally the shower screen of the phin filter combined with two AP paper filters (that are attached to the metal filter with some water adhesion) kinda fits perfectly inside! It creates a pretty good seal! After adding my grounds in the AP with the flow control cap, I add this puck screen. With the paddle or any other sorts of spoon I apply some pressure to tamp the puck. Then just add your water and do your thing. If you want, keep slightly pushing down with your paddle while adding your water to be absolutely sure, the puck stays intact. The handle of the dispersion screen doesnt interact at least at zuppa shots. I really love this little fun workaround. I like to combine it with firstly a metal filter followed by a normal paper filter under the puck (in the flow control cap). The results are a little bit different than the shots with joepresso, but they taste pretty good! The flow acquires less pressure compared to the Joepresso I feel like. Actually haven't tried zuppa shots like this with the regular filter cap. Funny enough I figured out as well that the rest of the phin filter acts perfectly as a drip assist if you're playing around with other recipes. Since I thought some of you will also have a phin filter laying around, I might just share this hack. These phin filters should be pretty cheap, though I have no idea how they vary in sizes. 
Give it a go and let me know what you think!

Date #1 was a quick coffee date. He paid. No sparks, but no red flags.
Date #2 was a dinner/drink date planned by the guy. We split the dinner bill, and drinks were free (we went to a free wine tasting place). 
Date #3 (tonight) was proposed by the guy. He suggested that we see a musical and maybe get dinner after. 

Here is why I am not feeling it anymore. 
For the second dinner date planned by him, he only ordered a side vegetable dish - no main dish, no drinks. He said he had food at home and didn’t want to order much, and he didn’t want to order drinks because we were going to a free wine tasting place after. I ordered a main dish, and he ate most of my main dish. The conversation was decent, so I agreed to see him again. 

For tonight’s musical date, he just called and asked me if I wanted to get tickets (about $100/ticket) and if not, he would get our tickets. It is a show I’d like to see, so I’d be happy to treat him to it, but the fact it was suggested by him, he didn’t get tickets in advance (so available seats are not great), and he asked whether I would get our tickets, really turn me off. He also mentioned we can get dinner after the show, but from the prior dinner date experience, I’m not excited.

We ordered the honey toast, Choccy milk, Demoness latte, and the Demon Queen feast. I realize that the collaboration is closed now, but I'll get to the coaster giveaway at the end.

The honey toast was delicious (duh) and had the berry and banana ice cream on top with whipped cream on top and in the middle. The banana tastes like banana laffy taffy if you've had that. The Choccy milk drink tasted like chocolate milk (I'd hope so) and had a scoop of chocolate ice cream. My wife said that the Demoness latte was very strawberry and not much coffee flavor. The Demon Queen feast was ...good, I just think it would have tasted much better warm. It was the first time I've had omurice, but it was basically just spiced rice with not much flavor. The flavor was mainly in the cream sauce, in my opinion.

Now for the reason people probably opened the post: a giveaway of the coasters! I admittedly do not consider myself a fan of either Connor or Ironmouse, though I do like them. I just want to share the love with an actual fan who may not have been able to attend the cafe. So on the last photo, I numbered the coasters for reference. I have two of coaster #1, and one of coasters #2 and #3.

I can send to you if you live in the United States, since I can just slap a stamp on it and we're good. Due to weight limitations, I may have to restrict to 2 coasters per person.

We liked each other when we were 5 (kid's love), there were some cute kisses, hugs, but nothing too deep (ofc we were kids lol) but the point is we lost contact after preschool.

I've found her profile many years later and we texted each other few times but nothing special.

Maybe a week ago I started chatting with her once again and we are currently talking for the past week daily/almost daily. I'm always the one texting first but she isn't dry at all and she is replying really good (long messages, triple, quad texts that are long, you get the point). We talked about going on a coffee date and we are both down, the question is when since we are studying in colleges that are in different cities, so we need to find a time where she gets back home for holidays or me going to that city she studies in.

She has on her profile description that she is an introvert, she said it herself also. I wrote multiple messages that were not directly telling her I'm interested in her, but still easy to tell so I think she knows. 

So her being talkative on texts, but still being an introvert gives me a really good sign (if im not delulu), but also her not texting me first is giving me the opposite vibe.

I don't want to rush things, specially because we are in different cities + i'm not sure what to think and do.

So I suppose I’d want a sitter to come twice a day: in the morning to turn on lights for the shy one and open up the bathroom door for a bit just so she gets light/air, and then again in the evening to feed all of the cats wet food. 

I’ve never worked with any sort of pet care service, so I’m open to your advice on those generally! I’ve heard way too many horror stories about Rover, so I’d love recommendations for a smaller service where I can get to know the sitter. (Would love a situation where I can take the sitter out for coffee first and get to know them so I can put myself at ease!!)",2,1765571024.0,astoria,3,1.0,False

1pl226k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1pl226k/rivian_is_moving_fast_my_thoughts_after_meeting/,Rivian is Moving FAST! My Thoughts after meeting Rivian Engineers at Autonomy Day,"I just got back from Rivian’s Autonomy Day, and if I had to summarize the experience in a word, it would be: wowthatwasalotofinformationandit'ssocoolandtheeingineersoverthereareamazing.

As always - the YouTube version has more details and visuals (which is important to for the stuff I'm talking about here)  
Check it out on Thunder Volt Auto: [https://youtu.be/U4qIVBrAIfM](https://youtu.be/U4qIVBrAIfM)

Seriously, the engineers were so passionate and excited, and it was so cool to chat with them about what they've been working on behind closed doors for a long while! Also big shoutout to them for bringing me out there, it was incredible to meet and talk with all of these good (and incredibly smart) folks

There’s a ton to unpack, from an end to the highway geo-fence to Rivian’s answer to Tesla’s FSD.

**1. The Geo-Fence is Officially De-Fenced**

For anyone who owns an R1 Gen 2, this is a big one, and it's coming in the next week or two.

Universal Hands-Free (UHF), and it's a massive shift. UHF is designed to work on any road that has reasonably marked lanes—which translates to over 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada. You can bet your bottom dollar I will be testing this up and down when 2025.46 comes out. Roads with faded lines, roads with only a center line, and even completely unmarked roads where my R1 hallucinates lane lines that don't exist.

One catch with this one: you’re still required to manage things like traffic lights and stop signs for now. While the system \*is\* capable of recognizing them (we saw a point-to-point demo doing exactly that), it's not consistent enough yet to push it live to us.

**2. Point-to-Point Driving: Rivian’s FSD Challenger**

The second huge announcement was the preview of their Point-to-Point Driving system. This is Rivian’s direct answer to the full-stack self-driving systems we've seen elsewhere.

I got a demo ride near their office, and while it’s still rough around the edges (it’s an early engineering build, after all) it was felt smooth and confident.

The drive was \*mostly\* excellent, but, we had two disengagements: once when the system attempted to sail right through a red stoplight , and another time in heavy traffic where the system got a little confused about the path while other cars were veering to line up for a turn.

But here’s the key takeaway: **they’re moving fast**. The confidence and lack of ""twitchiness"" for a first public showing make me a believer. We should see this feature rolling out as part of the paid Autonomy Plus suite in the coming year.

**3. The R2 Hardware Revolution: LiDAR and In-House Silicon**

The R2 Autonomy Computer is getting a total hardware overhaul, and they’re coming out swinging. The sheer ambition here is what makes it so cool.

\* Custom Silicon: Rivian built its own chip. Seriously. The new \*\*Rivian Autonomy Processor 1 (RAP1)\*\* is a custom System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designed specifically for their AI and autonomy workloads, manufactured on TSMC’s 5nm process (the same TSMC that builds Apple’s chips). This dedicated processing power is what enables the next generation of AI driving.

\* Integrated LiDAR:The R2 will be equipped with LiDAR sensors. Rivian managed to integrate them so smoothly you’d barely notice they’re there—a massive design feat. This is a game-changer for high-level autonomy (Eyes-Off, Hands-Off driving) and those tricky ""edge cases"" like heavy rain or low light where cameras alone struggle.

\* Goodbye Sonar: The old parking sonar sensors are being replaced by dual-mode radars on each corner. This is likely a simplification and cost-cutting measure, but radar I suspect it will likely function very much the same for the end user

These hardware upgrades pave the way for exciting long-term features like Personal Level 4 autonomy, where you can send the car to run an errand, like picking up the kids from school, entirely on its own.

**4. Autonomy Plus Pricing: A Total Undercut**

Rivian laid down the gauntlet on pricing for their advanced features, packaging it all under the new name, **Autonomy +**

**Outright Purchase: $2,500**  
**Subscription: $50 per month**

Launching in early 2026, this is a massive undercut to competitors, proving Rivian is serious about getting the technology into owners’ hands. Plus, they finally simplified the naming scheme from the old ""Rivian Autonomy Platform +"" to just ""Autonomy +."" Thank you, Rivian, for saving us all a few syllables!

**5. Rivian Assistant: The AI in the Dashboard**

The final major reveal was the new **Rivian Assistant.** This isn't just a profain chatbot. This AI is deeply contextual and built on a sophisticated, multi-model platform.

The assistant can handle things like:

\*Vehicle Context:""I'm low on charge, find the nearest DC fast charger and a coffee shop nearby.""

\*Personal Context: It can link to your calendar, understand text messages, and even reschedule appointments.

\*Hybrid PowerThe system uses a mix of Rivian-made models running locally on the vehicle (for instant commands like ""Set the temperature to 73°"") and cloud-based models (for more complex or conversational requests like ""It's too hot in here, can you do something?"").

It sounded like Google's Gemini and (possibly) OpenAI's GPT are both available back end agents for those cloud requests. But an important distiction to make here: Rivian Assistant  ≠ Gemini as we know it on smart phones and online. Rather, this is Rivian leveraging the Gemini API to process requests. We'll get more details as we get closer to launch, but it seems as if users likely won't have to log in with Google in order to use Rivian Assistant. They just help fulfill some of the requests on the back end. That said, direct integrations with you calendar (and possibly gmail in the future) WOULD require a Google login.

The future R2, with its 100 TOPS of dedicated AI processing power, will be able to handle most of these queries on the device, meaning faster responses and less reliance on a cell signal.

The Bottom Line

Rivian Autonomy Day wasn't just a teaser; it was proof that they are serious about fulfilling on autonomy. They showed that they've been building a comprehensive, vertically integrated system from the custom chips all the way up to the AI assistant.

I’ll be pushing the new Universal Hands-Free system to its limits as soon as it drops later this month, so make sure you’re following for the full review! The future of driving just got a whole lot more interesting.

I (30M) am the sole provider and I feel like I’m drowning with her,"TLDR: I don't know what to do. I started dating someone emotionally unstable and made things worse for both of us. How do I handle a relationship where everything is falling apart?

She (F29) and I (M30) have known each other for a long time, we went to the same middle and high school. We always had a crush on each other, but nobody ever made a move. We lost contact for about six years, but at the end of 2023, I found her Instagram thanks to an unexpected mutual friend.

We started dating, quickly became exclusive, and were very open about our relationship. Pretty quickly, we also chose to move in together. She was already renting a room downtown, and I was looking for a place because I had recently moved back from abroad.

The first few months were perfect, having your favorite person by your side. We spent a lot of time together, traveled, and ate out frequently. But things started to fade. I work remotely, while she was working on-site. Her job was stressing her out severely, causing hair loss, panic attacks, and other issues. We discussed it and agreed it would be okay for her to resign. I earn 10 times more than her, so money wasn't a problem. I thought it was better to prioritize the mental health of my future wife.

Since she quit her job, we have been together 24/7, and problems started to appear. She was always introverted and particular, but it got out of hand. She doesn't have friends, hobbies, and doesn't talk to most of her family. Having a job had forced her to have a social life and talk to colleagues.

I tried to motivate her to pursue a degree in IT, learn a new language, start hobbies like sewing or writing, or join me at the gym. But this was always delicate. If I pushed too hard, she would get mad and abandon the hobby immediately. Eventually, she abandoned all of them. She now spends most of her days doing chores, doomscrolling on TikTok/X, and playing video games. She frequently mentions suicide and wanting everything to end.

Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint. I knew from the beginning her biggest dream was to get married, move to a new state, and start a family. Since things started going downhill, I began postponing everything, the proposal, the marriage, and the planning. This made her cry often, and I wasn't vocal about my reasons.

It feels like she thinks getting married and moving away will solve all our problems, but we already live together and are sad all the time. To me, it just looks like an expensive ring and us being depressed in a different city. I should have talked to her about it, but honestly, I didn't have the balls. Every time I try to make a point, the discussion ends with me apologizing for complaining. Out of guilt and fear, I stay silent and try to work around the problems, but it’s not working.

The recent months have been especially hard. She won't leave the house by any means. She doesn't take the trash out anymore. I do the groceries alone and pick up all deliveries. She is caged. Eating out is rare, and always at the same restaurant. We stopped going to the movies or doing anything different.

In the past few weeks, she has become really mean to me, complaining about trivial things, like how I put sugar in my coffee, how much I sniffle, or that I didn't wake up to close the curtains. We had a fight recently where she said she doesn't want to marry me anymore.

I don't know what to do or how to talk to her about this anymore. She refuses any kind of psychiatric or psychological help. I also feel lost, alone, and disconnected. With all of this going on, I’ve lost touch with friends, family, and hobbies. I think the only thing keeping me sane and not unalive is going to the gym regularly.",24,1765570747.0,relationship_advice,40,0.94,False

1pl20oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1pl20oc/i_didnt_miss_my_connecting_flight_but_i_missed/,"I Didn’t Miss My Connecting Flight, But I Missed Something Else","On December 2nd evening, I was flying from Chennai to Hyderabad on an Indigo flight. It was delayed by almost two hours, still somehow flight was completely full. This was just before the wave of mass flight cancellations. I almost always choose a window seat, and this time was no different. When I boarded, no one was sitting in the two seats beside me. As the captain announced that boarding was complete, I realized I had an entire row to myself. On a full flight

Just before takeoff, though, an air hostess walked in and sat on the aisle seat, leaving the middle seat empty. She clearly wasn’t part of the cabin crew for this flight probably was heading home after finishing her shift. A moment later, an uncle appeared out of nowhere and pointed out that she was sitting in his seat. She quickly, stood up, and moved to the middle seat instead.I had already had a long day. I was exhausted and trying to sleep, but my mind wouldn’t cooperate. I had a connecting flight from Hyderabad with barely a 20-minute gap between landing and departure. The delay had made everything feel fragile, like one more small disruption would throw the whole plan off. 

That’s when I noticed her scrolling through her phone. She was looking at photos selfies with her family, candid moments, small slices of a life outside airports and uniforms. I know I shouldn’t have looked. I had no right to glance at something so personal. But I did. She had these big, expressive eyes and a smile that felt effortless, the kind that doesn’t try to impress but somehow does anyway. I caught myself turning my head slightly to look at her face instead of the screen. She was beautiful. Not in a dramatic, attention grabbing way but quietly, naturally. You’d never guess she had just finished a long shift. She looked fresh, composed, like someone untouched by the chaos of travel. Her outfit was simple and proper, her presence calm.

I wanted to talk to her. To say something. Anything.But I didn’t. Part of me didn’t want to be *that* guy. And yet, another part of me didn’t want to let the moment pass without even trying. The entire flight, my mind kept rehearsing different ways to start a conversation and finally found what felt like the perfect topic to start with…

“Excuse me,” I said, waving my hand slightly. She took off her AirPods and looked at me.  
“Yes, sir?” “What’s the policy if I miss my connecting flight?”

Honestly, I don’t remember a single word she said after that. I couldn’t have cared less about the policy the  thing that had been keeping me awake all flight.  I was instead looking at her eyes going left and right,  Her lips moved in slow motion as she explained something, probably important, probably useful. I nodded at all the right places, pretending to listen.I asked a few more stupid questions after that. Not because I needed the answers, but because I wanted a little more time. A few more seconds of conversation. A few more chances to look at her without it feeling strange. Somewhere in my head, I was secretly hoping the flight would stretch itself out a little longer.

It didn’t.

The plane landed soon after. People stood up, bags came down from overhead bins, and the quiet bubble around us broke. As we were getting ready to deboard, she reached into her bag and handed me a snack. 

“It’s my favorite,” she said.  
“It’s not fried, it’s baked.”

Those were her exact words.I smiled, said thank you, and took it. That small gesture felt oddly intimate, like something I’d remember long after the flight details faded.I wanted to ask her name. Or her number. Or even something simple like where she was headed next. But I didn’t. I don’t know why I just couldn’t. Maybe I didn’t want to cross an invisible line. Maybe I didn’t want to turn a quiet moment into something awkward. Or maybe I just didn’t have the courage. We walked out with the rest of the passengers and disappeared into different directions of the airport, just two strangers who shared a few rows, a few glances, and one short conversation at 30,000 feet.

The only reason I’m writing this here is because I believe she lives in Hyderabad, based on a few pictures I accidentally saw. And I want her to know if she ever reads this what was going on in my head at that moment. I don’t know why that feels important. Maybe it isn’t at all. Maybe this is just me trying to give meaning to a passing encounter.But just in case she’s reading this:

1pl20k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1pl20k3/stop_falling_into_the_traps_and_start_actually/,Stop falling into the traps and start actually healing,"Hey guys. I’ve had DP and DR for over a decade. I’ve recovered from it completely, fallen back into it, tried every type of therapy(CBT, DBT, rTMS, Ketamine, etc), tonsssss of different medicines, bought tons of online courses, and read the forums. Im almost out of it for my second time now. I think there is a HUGE misconception with DPDR, or at least some stuff that needs to be classified better. I’ll use diabetes as an example. When your pancreas doesn’t work all the time, it’s Type 1. When it works just not enough(so some of the time), it’s Type 2. And these are treated differently. I strongly believe it is the same with DPDR. Type 1 being those of us who are in it 24/7, and Type 2 being the ones that just get it when they feel anxious or stressed. Why do I believe they are different? Well besides the obvious ones 24/7 and feels neverending, like I said I’ve purchased almost every online course for DPDR. I was desperate like a lot of people. Those who just get it sometimes, their solution is to prevent it from happening vs us who have it 24/7 can’t do that… We need to get out of it first. If you’ve read through the subreddit, you’ve seen how much conflicting information there is. Also a huge thing, I feel like a lot of people have neither Type 1 or 2 and just slap the label onto themselves as DPDR. All of this together just makes it impossible to find information, it helps no one. Also to the online courses, I find it funny you all bash the American Health Care system, then charge more than them(looking at you The DP Manual & (Andres Wolf & Nick Derenzo(these guys is the worst offender imo, they change the prices based on how much money you make and lies about his condition, they very obviously never had it and just says what people on the forums say. They are literally a team of scammers there are more in their group so if you know their names comment them below. A LOT of people try to capitalize in this market because they know how desperate we are).

I think that is the most important thing because no one can find the help they need because everyone wants to call everything DPDR. I’ll put it in the most basic terms possible. If you don't know if you have something or not, like you think it’s just stress, it is 1000% not DPDR. DPDR isn’t a question about whether you have it or not, it's very black and white “normal” vs this, it is trying to figure out what it is(which is why a lot of people think its psychosis, because they read the DPDR forums and see people talking about completely different stuff. DPDR is hard to explain for everyone not just you). I pray this changes. I’d like this to be the pinned post in the sub reddit because I haven’t seen a single other person talk about this and I think it is the most important thing, people are trying to treat a symptom they don’t even have and it’s also hurting the people who do have it.

Now that that’s out of the way. Online gurus. Please stop thinking buying a book or manual is going to teach you a new way to get rid of it. Online courses are definitely worth it to some if you fit this: You are the type of person who doesn’t take action and needs help with that. But even then, coaching is more important than the books in that case. Every single “book” is just what you’ve already read online, condensed. So let me condense it all for you even more and save you the time and money. These are the things that have helped me both times I’ve had it, and I’ve talked to other people who’ve gotten rid of it.

Meditation. Focus on just the air coming in and out of your mouth, nothing else. No thoughts. A good strategy is in your head to keep saying “in in in in” when you’re inhaling and “out out out out” while exhaling.

Grounding exercises. Close your eyes always for these. Deep breaths in your nose, out your mouth. I usually do 3-5. Sit down somewhere. Place your hands and feet down. Try to feel what’s touching where on your body(like the couch under your butt, your socks on your feet if you have socks on, or the floor if not). A really good one but is usually harder is imagining a dot on your body, it never lifts up, it’s moving to different places and you have to focus on it. The top of your head, your earlobe, each finger tip.

BE MINDFUL. Biggest one imo. If there you feel like you are missing a key piece of information, I believe it is right here. Look at your hands and say “these are my hands”. When you are on your phone, pay attention to your hands. Say out loud or in your head what you are doing. “I am walking”. “I am lifting up the left leg”. The more you do it the more helpful it is. This is essentially what got me out of DP. Online gurus also just promote this as a way to just “calm down”. No. You need to practice being mindful 24/7. I feel DP is literally not being mindful at all, so if you practice it will help out with DP so much, and for me DP and DR were always hand in hand, help one help the other.

Plan your day out. DPDR is anxiety. Planning your day takes a huge part of that out, wondering what you are going to do. For me I plan when I’ll eat, sometimes what I’ll eat. I plan walks, doing a hobby for a little bit. This also helps avoid burnout which can also lead to stress and anxiety.

Supplements. Natural supplements are something most people lack especially if you don’t go outside much, don’t eat properly, etc. I think everyone should see a professional for this.

No drugs or stimulants. This one pisses me off. Don’t listen to these people telling you it’s okay to keep drinking coffee or vaping. For one(and I did every drug under the sun so Ima be a hypocrite here for a second), it’s hurting your health. For two, the bigger reason for drugs, you are numbing yourself and suppressing your emotions and thoughts. Each time you numb yourself, you are forgetting more and more about why you even felt that way. Sure you’ll forget why, but the feeling won’t go away, ask anyone. Have you ever seen a drug addict “finish” his course lol. Stimulants just increase anxiety as well. They will tell you “don’t make too many changes at once, it's too hard and can make you fail easier.”... Okay? But if you are still doing some of it… You are barely benefitting at all. That one coffee a day still is gonna boost your anxiety.

Lastly, I know this one a lot of people won’t do. Try to stay off screens. Me and  a lot of people I’ve talked to with DPDR, you get trapped in the screen. You tunnel vision onto it. You don’t even see anything else happening around you besides what is on screen, and that stresses and overstimulates you without you even realizing.

A therapist can definitely be helpful, but for me they weren’t and I know a lot of people are also like this. All the other guides are just saying therapy in different ways, these are all the strategies ive gotten from therapy that seem to help with dpdr and help other when i recommend them

Few key things to always keep in mind. NEVER fight DPDR. Think about it like this because this is literally what is happening: Your brain is protecting you from something it thinks is much scarier. So you think this is bad right now, your brain is telling you hey if we weren’t like this right now, we would be MUCH worse. A lot of people who just got DPDR won’t like to hear but I promise you it’s a good thing not bad, stop trying to return to your old self. Your brain literally does not want that. Your consciousness does, not the brain or nerves. That is actively contributing to DPDR. When you are out of DPDR, you will be much better off than before you had DPDR. That’s an absolute promise for everyone. Last but not least, you've probably already heard this, try not to think about it. Let me put this in a way that actually works though because it’s not possible to just not think about it lol. When you are doing the exercises, don’t do it to get rid of DPDR. It’s not instant. There is no instant option. I’ve seen people recover in a week, I’ve seen decades. It is dependent on YOU. Not “oh i’m different it’s gonna last longer in me”, no, it’s your will power to keep fighting. If you do it trying to get rid of DPDR, you will get discouraged very fast when you don’t instantly start seeing results. For me and many others, results sometimes take a while, then once they start happening they just keep continuing to happen faster and faster as long as you don’t stop trying. If you are scared of it you will never heal. If you ask a lot of the people who have healed, they will tell you the exact same symptoms and how much it sucked, but they won’t be all upset and scared about it. You are not a special case of this, promise.

If anyone needs advice, I do not charge. Im not a professional just someone whos been through all of it and tired of seeing people go down the same hole over and over. DPDR didn’t allow me to have the teen/early adult years that I wanted to, so don’t let it do the same for you. I believe all of this should be free. Stop trusting any of these gurus. If they charge you money, they are not here to help you. If placebo works for you, sure. But if you know it doesn’t then I’m just telling you right now, you’ll just be disappointed. Take action. Stop sitting around. Stop saying tomorrow.",2,1765570679.0,dpdr,2,1.0,False
1pl20h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pl20h6/im_seeing_someone_he_picks_me_up_and_takes_me/,I’m seeing someone. He picks me up and takes me home. Have coffee or dinner almost everyday. Hold hands. Give each other gifts. We consider each other special in our lives. Say I love you. Happy with each other.,"Disclaimer: We are both discreet guys (apparently).

Suddenly, I accidentally found out that he is or was in a relationship while everything is happening. I can’t confront him about it since he always dodges the question. Sometimes I even joke that I’m fine with staying at the best-friend level as long as nothing changes and he tells me everything, but he’s still not budging.

I even investigated it (sorry ☹️) just to find facts, and true enough, everything was real and he never mentioned anything about it. There was also a shift in his messages—before, he would call or text every day, but now he says that after work, he’s already tired, which is why he couldn’t reply. Then the next day when he picks me up, we’re okay again, and then it repeats (I give in easily).

I need advice. While I don’t have the right, even as his best friend, I was hurt that he didn’t tell me this part of his life, which even seems legal/approved by his parents. 😭

1. Do I just keep our relationship like this as if nothing happened or I didn’t know anything?
2. Do I confront him even if it might end our friendship, which I’m also scared of because I really enjoy his company?

I’m torn. My heart is happy but my brain is killing me from overthinking a lot of things.

I know the answer might be obvious, but I just love the guy so much I can do anything for him.

1pl1zuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Heartpalpitations/comments/1pl1zuq/bad_heart_palpitations/,Bad heart palpitations,"Hey guys, I’ve been having some heart palpitations, let’s say 5-6 months now, some minor, and some major. For instance last night, I was having a hard time getting to sleep, kept waking up every 5-10 minutes after finally drifting off, and each time I had woke up, something had just felt off in my chest. I kept trying to ignore it and kept drifting off, until around the 3rd time, my chest had gotten super tight, my left arm had felt tingling, and i was experiencing 120-140bpm. After 10-20 minutes of worrying that I was dying, it had finally gone anyway, but my anxiety had kept me up for the next following hour or two. Today I had woke up and I can feel a tightness in my chest and it will NOT go away. I’ve had an episode such as this a couple of times in the 6 months but I am really beginning to worry something is wrong with my heart. I’ve had a trip to the ER, ekg and x-rays all came back fine, blood tests had came back fine, and after a long wait of 5 months to see a cardiologist, he had basically exclaimed that I was too young (27) to be experiencing something negative heart related. They had initially put me on Fluoxetine 10mg, and signed me up with a psychiatrist, leaning more towards me having some form of anxiety that has slowly crept out with age, and I have leaned off of my Fluoxetine with my psychiatrist as I haven’t felt a difference in my mood whether i’m on the medicine or not. I am reluctant to go back to the DR with my problems because it seemed that they had brushed my issues off and just diagnosed me with something. Any advice? I drink VERY occasionally in a social environment, 6 months free from THC, but have failed to get away from Nicotine, I drink coffee, and my diet isn’t too incredibly awful. I used to be very active, but since this has happened, I have been afraid to go back to the gym because of my heart and have become slightly overweight. ",2,1765570628.0,Heartpalpitations,1,1.0,False

It was a large one too. I didn't realise until I had the kind of mega productive few hours at work that I used to do on caffeine, and then spent an hour tidying my office. This was after a terrible night, which i was planning on making up for with strategic naps. It's 9 hours later and I still feel it. I can feel my body is tired, but my mind is racing. I just want it to stop now. I'd gotten used to managing my body's tired signals, now it's like they're completely masked.

1pl1yoy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pl1yoy,Help me choose: Micra or Mini for this specific space? (Taj Mahal counters),"Hey!

I’m finally ready to upgrade from my Breville and join the club, but I am torn between the Linea Micra and the Linea Mini. I’m leaning towards the White colorway for either option to match the Taj Mahal quartzite, but I’m struggling with the size constraints and aesthetics.

Here are the dimensions of my coffee station:

• Vertical Clearance: 18 inches exactly (counter to bottom of upper cabinet).

• Cabinet Depth: 12 inches (the uppers).

• Counter Depth: 25 inches.

My main concerns:

1. Visual Balance: Since the Micra is smaller, does it look ""lost"" in a kitchen with standard spacing? Or does the Mini look too crowded under 18"" cabinets?

2. Workflow: For those with 18"" clearance, is the Mini annoying to refill or stack cups on top of?

3. Aesthetics: I think White is the move here, but open to suggestions if you think another color would suit this palette better.

I’ve attached photos of the current setup for context. Any advice on which machine would feel more ""at home"" in this spot would be greatly appreciated!

1pl1yem,https://i.redd.it/hd3hnqknzt6g1.jpeg,studied roughly 15 days for SAA-C03 and passed!,"Hey everyone, recently had to get the SAA-C03 exam for work and passed it in 15 days. If anyone else is trying to study and pass this exam very fast, hopefully this post can be useful. For two weeks straight I studied around 4-5 hours a day.

Prior to the exam I had minimal experience working with AWS, had just dipped my toes in it as a junior SWE. 

I watched all of the Stephane Maarek course on 2x speed, didn’t follow along with the hands on videos, occasionally paused to take notes on the slides. 

Once I had finished the course, I had about 4 days before the exam and started taking as many of the TutorialsDojo practice exams as I could—definitely better imo than the ones on Udemy, as I felt the one I had taken didn’t follow the exam as closely as the TutorialsDojo ones. Had I redone this process, I would have started taking practice exams much sooner as there were just tons of services and features that showed up that either weren’t in the course or were very lightly discussed. 

If I didn’t get a passing score on a practice exam, I retook it the next day. After every exam, I read through every question and its explanation (even if I had gotten it correct) and made notes on details I had missed or hadn’t known.

Exam day I woke up 2h before and had a nice hearty breakfast and a giant cup of coffee before heading to the exam room :)

Takeaways are probably that the longer you wait to transition to practice tests, the more difficult it can be to retain all of the knowledge learned. Kudos to everyone also trying for this exam, good luck!",9,1765570529.0,AWSCertifications,4,0.91,False

1pl1wcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/crownheights/comments/1pl1wcp/what_would_you_do_in_this_situation/,what would you do in this situation?,"I (25F, with an infant child) need some advice. there’s a person on my block that’s unfortunately in active addiction and doesn’t behave in a way that makes me feel safe (following me down the block when he sees me, trying to talk to or touch my daughter, etc) and I’m not sure what to do in this situation.

he has approached and followed me multiple times now to ask for money, to the point where the man who runs the bodega on my corner had to step in for me today and make sure he left me alone. (I have tried helping him in the past and he threw hot coffee onto someone’s windshield so I now no longer give him cash or food).

does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this when taking my daughter out? especially because this person is significantly larger than me and has very erratic/unpredictable behavior. I don’t want to break my lease and we can’t afford to move right now anyways, but I don’t know what to do.

(I really do not to get police involved, especially because this person isn’t doing anything illegal,  it’s just making me uncomfortable).

thank you in advance. I do really want to approach the situation with empathy but it is really starting to make me nervous to go outside.",17,1765570381.0,crownheights,8,1.0,False
