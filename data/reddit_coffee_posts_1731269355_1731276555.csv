Then... I proceeded to *actually move* stuff off nightstands, coffee table, end tables, chest of drawers,  etc. I wiped everything down several times, removing old Pledge build-up, really using some elbow grease and determination. Old English (the furniture oil/scratch cover, not the malt liquor) was liberally applied to some dinged-up antique stuff.  Then I polished with fresh Pledge. 

And I did it all before 10 am.

I struggle with a lot of issues, behavioral things, alcohol abuse...trauma. Tuesday had me reeling. I usually cheat clean, with Swiffers, Windex, pre-moistened wipes, you know...lazy stuff.

1goc91g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1goc91g/i_will_pay_you_to_help_me_rewrite_and_feedback/,I will pay you to help me re-write and feedback. Process statement at the bottom. ,"I have been called here today to address an issue that plagues every household. It is the scourge of every roommate, son, daughter, and single human being trying to maintain a base level of domestic decency. I, of course, am speaking of the much-detested chore, the dishes.
 
Throughout history, this ailing duty has broken families and friendships alike. From the age of ashes and vinegar to the modern-day detergent, no human has been able to escape this task of mediocrity. It is then, my charge, to provoke your unwilling bodies into action with the only power I possess… words.
 
It’s with these words that I try to rouse myself, to confront the mountain of dishes and surfaces stained by daily wear and missed moments. I can see them all, as I stand here, sponge in hand, contemplating not just the grime on plates but the layers of memories clinging to them. I scrub harder, not just to cleanse my kitchen, but as if by scrubbing I might wash away the unresolved thoughts clinging to my mind. And it’s in this very act, this simple act that one might otherwise despise, that I feel the rush of water as a balm, a brief escape from the growing noise within me.
 
Think now of the small delights that lay ahead. First, the calming white noise delivered by the rush of water spouting forth from the faucet. Then the warmth of the hot, but not too hot, water caressing your skin. Move on then to the playful scent of an antibacterial dish soap. Feel the potential and power rising as water meets sponge, meets detergent, and, born of this combination of chemistry and might—suds.
 
From the will of life ordained upon you from one million burning suns, pick up that first filthy article and brandish the weapon obtained from the great mysterious depths that your local merchant has exchanged for a modest fee. And as I grip this sponge and turn toward the cluttered counter, I realize this is no ordinary fight against dirt; this is a battle against the residue of all the days I’ve let go by without confronting what really needs to be cleaned. .
 
The very sponge, which was resting comfortably in my hand just a few minutes ago, feels like a burden now-wet and heavy. Every swipe across the countertop feels  like warring against the grease but also the recollections stuck on its surface. I scrub harder, reminding my senses of the friction that defines my life, my home, my essence. The lemon cleaner’s scent is strong and synthetic, attempting to mask the damp smell of unrealized aspirations and unspoken words.
 
Fear not the grime of three-day-old food particles. Fear not the stench of carrion. And above all else, fear not the threat of existentialism pertaining to your life choices beyond those of ignoring this mundane kitchen chore. For the satisfaction, however brief, will be a kind distinction between the past and future self.
 
As I wash, I can hear the dishes clinking in the sink, each sound echoing the noise in my life. The plates, once lively and full of expectation, now stack like unresolved problems in my mind. They’re containers for countless meals and arguments, a materialization of the discord that seems to multiply daily. I pick up a broken cup, its handle chipped—a reflection of me. It reminds me of nights with coffee and friends, filled with laughter that faded into awkward pauses, and days that passed without me noticing.
 
The very layout of the kitchen seems to scowl at me, the walls closing in as if judging my efforts. I look at the frayed apron draped over the doorknob, its thin gray patch covering a thick orange body stained by countless spills, reminders of my attempts to cultivate a life I sometimes feel I don’t deserve. Each time I wear it, I remember all the occasions I tried to create a perfect home, only to watch my efforts fade like the apron’s worn threads. It smells of burned food and forgotten recipes, much like the visions I strive for—the unbaked cookies I eventually threw away.
 
a knock on the door jolts me from my daydream. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the door open, my heart racing as I stand there with the sponge in my hand, as if it could protect me from what’s beyond. I know who it is—him. The tension rises as he surveys the mess like a vulture over carnage. “Did you separate the things that are already sorted?” he asks, his voice flat, as if he doesn’t really care, but the words are as sharp as broken glass. I smile, a practiced smile masking my inner turmoil, perfected through frequent use, hiding the distress that seems to grow within me. “Almost,” I respond, the lie escaping my lips as second nature, my head instinctively turning away from his gaze.
 
And yet, as I face these objects around me—the dishes, the sponge, the broken cup—I sense an urgency within myself that refuses to be ignored. Each time I reach for a new dish, it’s as though I am fighting more than just leftover food; I am wrestling with the weight of each unaddressed conflict, each dream abandoned or deferred. The act of cleaning becomes my call to confrontation.
Every stroke feels ironic. Here I am, cleaning, frantically trying to impose order, as if the mess around me might grant me power over my existence. “Today, I’ll shut the closet door and reorganize the clutter,” I think, but I know better. The end will come, but so will the chaos; the white noise will return, as it always has, taunting me.
 
The walls seem to close in, alive, resisting anyone who tries to tame them. The discarded clothes on the floor lie indifferent to my efforts, scattered like my thoughts. I push them into the closet, shut the door with a bang, trying to keep the chaos out of sight. But I know better; behind that door, a storm brews, waiting to spill out as soon as I turn away.
 
And then, I stand there, watching myself shed a solitary tear—a muted scream of sadness and frustration in the turmoil that surrounds me. I quickly wipe it away, unwilling to dwell on how vulnerable it makes me feel. As I close the door, I realize that every time I step back into this room, I bring the mess with me. It’s like a collapsed lung, both familiar and suffocating—a reminder that chaos isn’t just in the things around me but within me as well.
 
Perhaps it’s time to confront what I’ve been avoiding for so long. Maybe true cleaning isn’t about tools in hand; maybe it’s about looking deep inside myself. The objects strewn around my house reflect the state of my inner self, and maybe the only way to clean for real is to relearn how to feel.
 
Standing in the kitchen—sponge in hand, weight pressing down on me—I understand that this is a process, this pursuit of clarity, for a home and a soul alike. It’s about risk-taking, facing fears, and accepting life’s inherent messiness. And maybe, just maybe, I will learn to forgive myself for being so messy and even appreciate it, because stories are born from mess, not from attempts at perfection.
 
With that thought, I take a deep breath and look around, no longer seeing chaos but a story—my story, woven with both disorder and meaning. I twist the knob, place the sponge on the sink’s edge, and as calm settles over the room and myself, I embrace the turbulence that is a part of me.

I am a designer and creative who is a proud disabled queer polyamorous cis man using he/him pronouns. I have been polyamorous for 2+ years. I am looking to meet new people and eventually form multiple romantic relationships that offer emotional intimacy, companionship, and a romantic connection. As a gynesexual man, I hope to meet some cute male, female, trans, or nonbinary folx, with common interests that I can enjoy getting to know, flirt with, and seeing what develops. Ideally, I am looking for someone local and/or long-distance. Interested in solo or couples!

About me: I love exploring new bars & restaurants, live music, visiting art museums & galleries, and community events. I am a huge fan of movies and every year I attempt to watch every Oscar-nominated film whether it's from sound mixing to documentaries to animation to animated/live-action shorts, I’ll watch it. I tend to enjoy nerdy things like my love for Star Wars, Game of Thrones, LOTR, anime, and most things that are fantasy-related. I enjoy the occasional video game, especially Final Fantasy games and recently Baldur’s Gate 3.

I would enjoy having conversations over coffee while walking in the park! Let's get to know each other, drink some tequila, watch tennis, curl up over a good TV show or movie, and see what comes of it. 

Only interested in individuals who are anti-ableist, anti-racist, anti-fatphobic, queer-affirming, pro-women’s rights & fully vaxed! Totally against toxic masculinity, the patriarchy, and unhealthy male power dynamics.

If you think we'd be a good match, send me a message with your age, location, and a little bit about you. I can't wait to get to know you!",1,1731276206.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

While some worked perfectly, others have split such that Plex is recognizing each chapter as its own book. For example, this is how it processed Catch 22. This is really annoying because the tracks are seemingly all out of order and many chapters are very short, so to listen to them I would need to sort through and find the correct individual chapter every few minutes. All of the chapters of the book are in one folder on my computer, but the title doesn't even register in Plex. How can I get Plex to nest the chapters under the same book?

1goc615,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1goc615/aitah_for_beating_up_my_bfs_wife_pregnant_and/,AITAH for beating up my bf's wife (pregnant) and then my best friend (pregnant). ,"So for some context I 19 (F) have been attending university for about 6 months now and I have a pretty tight knit group so I don't talk to that many people only my friends, Maddison 20 (F) and Lisa 18 (F) there's this one professor we'll call him Jake. Jake's a chill teacher the one that doesn't really care what you do as long as you get your work done so one day when I had to stay after class Jake who's 39 (M) helped me with something I was struggling with in his class and it was pretty late so he offered me a ride home and at the time I didn't have a car so I was walking to and from school and when I told Jake I could have walked home he insisted that he give me a ride home because I was young and he didn't want anything bad to happened so I agreed.

So he gives me a ride home and he asks me if I wanted to stay for dinner now at the time I didn't know he was married or had kids because the university I went to and he worked at was in a different then the town that he lived in with his wife and kids so he got a small apartment in town that way it was convenient for him so I said sure to the dinner because I was pretty hungry anyway and I didn't think anything at first so we go back to his place and he make Chicken Alfredo (my favorite) and after we're done with dinner we just talked for a bit and one thing led to another and we kissed now at the time I wasn't seeing anybody so I didn't think It was that big of a deal and so I lot he was gonna stop but he kept going and he was my professor so I didn't want him to get mad so I agreed and the next thing you know I wake up the next day in his bed.

Now he seemed like a pretty great guy so I didn't think anything weird was going on until I saw a girls name pop up when he was in the shower now this is where Elizabeth comes into play now Elizabeth 35 (F) looked a bit older than me but I couldn't really see her face only her name and her forehead by the time Jake got out of the shower the call had missed so I had asked him who Elizabeth was and he said that she was his sister so I believed him because I thought why would a guy lie about something like that? So he took me to school dropped me off pretty far back so that no one saw us and went to his room now he was successful, smart, and overall really handsome so I had a crush on him and when I went to talk about yesterday he admitted that he felt the same so we started dating and pretty sone after he asked me to move in and I said yes.

Now this is where he started acting differently whenever his phone would ring he would rush to get it always turning is phone away at first I just thought he didn't want a miss a call but then something weird started happening he would come home later he would smell like perfume but not young real perfume like old fake perfume that's how I knew it wasn't mine now when I asked him at first he denied but then he said something crazy he said that he was just at his mom's checking in on her now he had told me that his mom lived out of town but that still didn't excuse the perfume he said that she hugged him and she was always wearing that perfume so I believed him. Now this is where I found out about Elizabeth know I was in the kitchen cooking when I get a text from a random number and it said Is this Sara? Me: yes and who's this.OP: I'm you're boyfriends wife. At first I thought she was lying but then she called me and asked to meet so I agreed now I'm not ghetto or anything but my mom taught me to stand up for myself and the people I love so going into this I was ready to get to the bottom of this.

So I get there and we are polar opposites I have blonde hair green eyes and a little thick, Elizabeth however has redhair blue eyes and is super skinny so I mediately think she's lying because we look nothing a like so I get there and we get to talking and she's says that she and Jake have three young kids together and she assumed he was cheating because he visit for like an 1 and then say he has to grade papers now I thought she was lying because the drive from the town were in and she's in is like 15 minutes but he was gone like 3 hrs so I ask her if he was over there Friday and she said no now Friday he was gone from 3-7 4 hrs so I was confused and then I remembered something about his mum so I asked her and she said his mum died about 5 yrs ago so I was confused angry and sad at the same time now I was pretty pissed and when she tried to comfort me I was not in the mood and then she tries to ask me to stop seeing him for their children's sake now at the time he was all I had and I was not ready to give him up. So I said no and that she needs to divorce him since he was clearly not with her for her and she got pretty mad so then she proceeds to pull my hair and rip my shirt so then I go into attack mode and pour hot coffee on her and beat her up prettybadly and then she yells for me to stop as she is pregnant.

So I eventually stop and go home after she said she was pregnant I didn't believe her and bought 3 pregnancy tests because I saw this thing on TikTok where you and you're friends all take pregnancy tests and mix them up and see who's pregnant now this is where my best friends come into the story so we all take the test and there I was looking at two two lined pregnancy tests now at the time Madison wasn't seeing anybody that we knew of and neither was Lisa I was the only one in a relationship so when we saw the tests Madison mediately started freaking out and called some man by the tone of his voice now we didn't know she was seeing anybody and thought she was single until she put her phone down to use the restroom and grab her stuff that's when I grab her phone to see who she called and mediately recognize the number Jake's number so when she gets out the restroom I'm pissed and ask her what the hell and she says that she didn't know me and Jake were serious even though I told them we had been dating for a while and they both congratulated me so I start yelling and them she proceeds to push me into the coffee table so I said bring it and then I drop kick her and punch her belly that's when Jake comes in and drags me off her and Lisa's in the back crying for us to stop then yells at me calling me a crazy a-hole for fighting Madison knowing we're both pregnant that's Jake looks at me and asks if she serious then pulls out of the house and takes me home

""As far as I am aware Kyssehiluin all the pepe coins and KRC20's knocking about are all different. I may be wrong on that as some maybe affiliated with others, but this Pepe coin is not affiliated with any of the other ones at all. This one unlike the others is it's own unique coin based off Doge has its own blockchain and unlike some of the KRC20's out there it isn't run by any sneaky smart contract that has no selling rules etc... and this one isn't a rug. It was created in order to give people a way to support the meme without the same risks as there are with other such meme coins. Everything I've seen so far looks to be genuine. The devs put in a lot of time answering questions very quickly and seem to believe in the thing they have created and are actively working on developing more features and building something more solid as time goes on. I am as skeptical as they come and am quick to believe the worst especially in the crypto space yet I do not get that sketchy feeling here."" 

I am a nobody who if it weren't for stakecube's faucet likely never would have found pepecoin at all, I almost pooped when one day I mistook pepecoin for that one priced at $2.48 per coin for obvious reasons.

As a kid, I was never allowed to spend the red envelope money I got from friends or family. They had to ""watch over it for me"" to make sure I didn't lose it. I didn't really appreciate the value of money since it always seemed like a superficial item that i couldnt use growing up.

I'm 28 now and it's very much the same deal. She demands access to my bank account to check my history. Her excuse is ""someone might be committing fraud and I need to check your spendings make sure nobody is stealing your information to buy stuff.""

She has text notifications set up on her phone and basically calls me everytime I make a big purchase on Amazon or whatever site to ask if I actually bought something. When I said yes, her follow up was always ""why do you need this item???? You shouldn't be spending on stuff you don't need. You need to save for your future family and kids."" Then I'd always need to justify why I bought the items to her and explained why I made the purchases.

Even for simple small purchases like coffee, she will ask ""i see u went to starbucks today. why do you need coffee? Just sleep earlier. Coffee causes cancer I read it online see. Do you want cancer? Don't buy coffee next time.""  Bascially all im allowed to spend on are bare necessities like groceries and housing. I used to change my password on purpose and ghost her when she called me to ask why the password was changed when I wasn't living at home. But now I'm living back at home it's impossible to keep them out of my bank account info cuz they will threaten me to save money or they will kick me out.

I dont spend much at all, at least not compared to my coworkers but it's fucking exhausting to be afraid to spent the own money you've earned on things you want to buy. What the fuck family or kids am I saving for exactly???? I don't have a significant other nor am I planning on marrying or having kids anytime soon. What is this mentality of always saving ""for the family"" that doesn't even exist? They are making me hate these future imaginary ""kids"" already. I do NOT want children if it means having to slave away for the rest of my life to provide for them.

Me (28m) and my wife split up. We are currently going through divorce and being UK based in about 12 months I will be free. That's a separate issue, around 7 weeks ago I decided I wasn't a witness, I still have faith, but the organisation and me are done. I stepped down as a servant and haven't really looked back. Since then (bar around 6 elderly ones) nobody speaks to me. 

I made a definitive decision to leave, so once I did I took up vaping. I have a stressful job and most of us smoke or vape. 

The elders have been informed by my parents that I'm vaping. A long time friend met me for a coffee and we chat. Ultimately it was a fact finding meet up and I told him honestly the above. 

My parents are adamant I'm going to be DF. But the elders book says tobacco use, I've never smoked a cigarette, only e-liquid. Has an official letter gone around saying vaping can cause DF? 

Any help is much appreciated, I don't want to be DF. Since the JW's have stopped talking I'm quite lonely and my family are PIMI. They will cut me off. ",0,1731275639.0,exjw,1,0.5,False

1gobsv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1gobsv7/astral_projection_or_lucid_dream_a_vivid/,Astral Projection or Lucid Dream? A Vivid Experience with Unusual Sensory Detail,"Hi everyone,

I’m a frequent lucid dreamer and have had OBEs in the past—mostly experiences like floating above my bed, flying around my house, and sometimes just exploring my immediate surroundings above my house. However, this past week, I had a lucid dream that felt unlike any experience I’ve had before, and it’s left me questioning whether it was astral projection or simply a very vivid lucid dream.

I wanted to share the experience to see if anyone else has had something similar, or if anyone has insights into what it might mean.

This dream was deeply surreal, intense, and emotional. The environment felt laid-back, yet charged with energy. It was an abstract, dreamlike place—distant lights glowing in the background and an overwhelming sense of movement around me. There were plenty of couches and chairs scattered throughout, with people lounging and socializing. Everyone  was blurry and felt engaged in their own world, but there was a collective sense of ease and peace. Despite the tranquil vibe, there was a palpable energy that seemed to hum around me, like the calm before something profound. It felt like a waiting room for souls, or some kind of transition space.

There was no sense of urgency here, but I definitely felt like I had a purpose, like I was meant to be there, but also that there was still work to do. Some of the other people around me seemed to be in a similar state of limbo—like they weren’t fully aware of where they were or what was going on.

The most striking part of this dream was the sensory experience. For the first time in a lucid dream, I could feel objects in a way that felt completely real. I ran my fingers over several objects placed on a small coffee table—a metallic prism, a bumpy cube and scaly pyramid, smooth spheres, and even a soft, fuzzy bench. The sensation started as a faint vibration in my fingertips similar to how your whole body vibrates before AP, but as I concentrated, the textures became vivid and clear. It felt almost like the dream world was syncing with my mind, like I was remembering the sensations of these objects and then instantly experiencing them. This was surreal, but also exciting. The more I focused on the textures and the objects, the more my sensory perception expanded. I could feel the roughness of the pyramid, the cool metallic feel of the prisms, and the softness of the couch. My heart rate quickened as I realized how real these sensations were—this wasn’t just a vivid dream; it felt as if I was actually interacting with the objects. I was actually feeling my heart beat with excitement.

Despite my excitement about the tactile sensations, I still had trouble moving around the space. I’ve always had trouble using my legs in dreams—I tend to float, fly, or drift instead of walking. The guide who had been with me suggested that I try kicking a large orb, about the size of a beach ball, which others around me were also trying to move with their legs. Some succeeded, some failed, but I couldn’t manage to move the ball at all. It felt like my body wasn’t entirely cooperating with my intentions. When I tried to feel my legs or move them, I couldn’t get a sense of physicality from them. They were there, but felt completely disconnected from my sense of self—like they were sleeping, or not fully engaged. It made me wonder if this disconnection was symbolic of the focus being more on my consciousness rather than my physical form.

Then, the guide brought me to someone who approached me—a stranger, but someone I felt an inexplicable connection to—and gave me a hug. This part of the experience is still haunting me. There was a deep sense of connection, almost like this person and I shared something on a soul level. But at the same time, I couldn’t understand who they were, nor could I feel anything physically. The hug was emotionally charged, yet completely detached from any physical sensation. I knew this person had some kind of connection to me, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The frustration of not being able to fully communicate or connect with them left me feeling strangely sad, like I was missing something important.

Behind me, the guide who had been observing me throughout the experience was still there, watching this exchange. I couldn’t hear their voice, but I could sense their presence—calm, patient, and maybe even a little protective. I wasn’t sure if this guide was the same male figure who had visited me in previous dreams, but I felt a deep sense of trust with them, as if I knew they had my best interests at heart.

I then asked the guide, “Is this the afterlife?” Their response caught me off guard: “it’s more complicated than that.” This answer lingered in my mind. I had asked the same question to another guide in a previous dream, a female figure, and her response had been far more dismissive—she seemed angry, like I wasn’t supposed to ask such questions. That response had immediately triggered my waking, but this time, the guide’s tone was measured and serious, almost like they were giving me a glimpse into something I wasn’t fully prepared for. The weight of their words made me feel uneasy, like I was approaching a boundary I couldn’t un-cross. It felt as though I was getting closer to something significant, but also something dangerous.

As the guide and I continued to interact, I became more curious and asked more questions. Another dimension? Can people use all their senses here?  The guide’s demeanor shifted slightly, and I began to feel like I was crossing into territory I wasn’t supposed to. The guide warned me that if I continued down this path of questioning, I might be crossing into a realm I wasn’t ready for—a realm that could mean I wouldn’t be able to return. I had a strong sense that continuing down that path could lead to something irreversible—maybe even death. The thought of crossing into a place from which I couldn’t return left me feeling unsettled. I instinctively pulled back, feeling like I needed to leave that space before it was too late, before I went too far. I distinctly felt that I had to stop and wake up that and that I would die if I continued. 

Soon after that, I felt a pull to return to my physical body similar to AP but I also recognize that I was still dreaming. There was a feeling of unfinished business, like I had to confront something or complete something. I woke up soon after, feeling disoriented and emotionally raw. The vividness of the dream stayed with me, but I couldn’t grasp what it all meant. The sensations, the emotional connections, and the eerie sense of being in a transition space left me questioning what I had just experienced.

This dream has left me with more questions than answers. Was I experiencing a kind of transition? A glimpse into a space between life and death or Lucid Dreaming and OBE? Or was this just a dream that my mind manifested to explore deeper spiritual themes? I’ve had experiences before, and I’ve met guides in those realms, but this one felt different—more real, more involved, and yet still deeply mysterious. My first time Feeling touch. 

Has anyone else had an experience where the tactile sensations felt so vivid and real, or where you felt deeply connected to someone you couldn’t fully understand? I’m curious to hear if anyone has had something similar, or if you think this might be an astral projection, a lucid dream, or something in between.

1gobs9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gobs9r/i_miss_you/,I miss you,"Around 2020-21 I would drink myself into oblivion and rarely, if ever, feel the urge to stop for the night until I would fall asleep. I'd bring my last drink to bed with me and have it on my bedside table. Often I would wake up with a nearly-full glass next to me. Not wanting to waste it, I'd put it in my fridge, and have it greet me 15 seconds after I get home from work the next day. Just an 8 hour break to make some money as a barista, and then back to booze.

I've made huge strides since then, and recognize that I'm firmly on the path to recovery, but was thinking today about what I miss about drinking. My mind returned to spending past Christmas breaks with my partner's family in Dallas. While my side of the family is very against alcohol, her family is very laid back. Being with them allowed me to feel relaxed and unafraid of bingeing with/around them. I miss having a tactile defense against anxiety and depression within arms' reach. Are you remembering that you don't like how your hair looks, or that your job is waiting for you when you return from holiday, or that you can't stand the thought of your own existence? Pass the wine. Can you get me another modelo? Yeah, fuck it I'll have another marg.

I'm walking along the beach in the morning, having a great cup of black coffee. I like myself, I'm confident. Day goes by and I'm doing fine. Waves are coming, but they're nothing big or frightening. The evening comes around and the tide seems to be coming in a bit. Nothing I can't handle, and hey, it's time for a beer. 20 mins later, the tide is getting higher but I'm having a good time. How about some whiskey? Now the beach is gone and I'm ankle deep in water. I climb up the rocky cliffside and refill my cup to distract myself from the rising sea. Jim Beam on the rocks. For the taste. This is what a masculine adult does. Now the water is at my waste despite my struggling up the crumbling debris. Well the water is coming whether I like it or not, so I dump the rest of the bottle (already?) into my glass, fall backwards, and drown.

I've come to realize that alcohol briefly solves the problem that it created, before promptly making it worse. I miss being so far gone that I didn't mind it. It was so easy to destroy my body. But now, I'm very aware of each time I drink, and how it makes me feel.

I am not sober. It's for this reason that at times I feel a bit out of place hanging out, reading and commenting in here. But it's been massively helpful in changing my mindset and helping me slow down, at the very least. Past me says fuck you to quit lit, therapy, and all of you in this sub for taking away my easy escape hatch and muddying up my cognitive dissonance with nuance and shit. Authentic and present me says **THANK YOU**. I never thought I would even be at this level of awareness, especially 3 years ago in the pit.

I'm making myself a pot of coffee right now. Here's to even more future growth, and stemming the tide. IWNDWYT",2,1731274999.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

Over the years I've had therapy of various kinds and got to a point where I thought I was fine and dandy, Have had no triggering episodes for several years, life's good, mostly. A few days ago I read a blog post from an Ukrainian veteran who was dealing with ptsd in his own way. And it hit... 

I just broke down, tears and snot and pain just pouring out, had now way of stopping it, went for a walk to get fresh air, and the tears just didn't stop, sat down on a rock and tried to call someone, just anyone, but couldn't manage, ended up managing texting the mother of a friend overseas, just pouring out words on the screen through the tears. She's always been supportive. 

Pain from so deep down I would never have imagined it could be there, just poured out with the tears and snot for more than an hour. Never had such an immensly intense, deep down crying episode before, total emotional purification and drainage, leaving me feeling almost dehydrated in the end. 

When it was over, I could breath and taste fresh air again for what felt like the first time in a decade, I never noticed that was an issue before. Visited my parents, and mum flat out said she saw something had changed, that I was shining more, held myself higher and such.   
  
Today when out on a walk, I decided to visit some old friends on a whim, something I haven't done for more than a decade(unless there's been an invite), just walking up to their door and entering, and was greeted with hugs, cake and coffee.  

That Ukrainian will never know how much he helped me with his words, I just hope he also gets help himself.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

i got berated over imessage that it was inconsiderate, rude, and bitchy to text him while he was busy at work. when he got home, he screamed in my face that he had a shitty day at work and it is angering that i would nag him over text that he needed to clean up. i felt that my text was very neutral and was meant as a reminder, not a demand. i think it’s important that we all clean up after ourselves and i’ve often gotten shit for asking him to do so. he can tolerate living in filth, but personally, i cannot. 

the screaming was extremely unnecessary and disrespectful to me. i clean up after him all the time, as well as work full time, go to school full time, and research (for free) for an independent book project; i don’t think his problems are any more important than mine, and having a bad day at work isn’t an excuse to verbally attack me over such a minuscule issue. 

this was my final straw, and im not interested in continuing this argument. i am moving next month, and have a sublease lined up, but i told him i would leave all the furniture and appliances in the apartment for him to use until our lease is over in june. i’ve since changed my mind. 

i decided that when i move out, im going to be taking all of my belongings and contributions back with me. this includes (but is not limited to) my two couches, my table, my chairs, my microwave, my toaster, my air fryer, my coffee maker, my kettle, my cookware, my rice cooker, my dishes, my utensils, my knife block, my broom, my mop, and my vacuum cleaner. 

i know it’s petty but at this point, i don’t care. i’ll gladly leave the apartment barren and force him to purchase all of the items that i contributed as revenge for the lack of respect and appreciation he has shown me.

The doctors thing is something I was thinking of posting/seeking advice/help on last night, the coffee thing is like a rn thing loll

Coffee first. I’m a senior in highschool, two years ago was first time I started drinking soda, not for caffeine purposes but sometimes rarely yes for the caffeine. Then since start of this year idk why it’s just been horrible. Usually I’m wide awake all the time but the start of this year I’ve been having a hard time focusing and frickin idk what’s wrong with me. I’ve gone from rarely sleeping to now I can hardly get through the school day without sleeping in at least one class. So I’ve tried drinking coffee a few times, I don’t really like the taste but I though screw it it can help. It never helped, Starbucks, etc. I’d drink pumpkin spice lattes (because I’m basic lol) and i really didn’t feel anything lmao so I thought “oh coffee sucks, tastes bad and doesn’t help”. Today I was again having trouble with focus and I have school crap to do that I haven’t been doing. I was also feeling kinda sad ngl, I went to the gas station thinking of trying cigarettes or whatever (I know very fucking stupid I’m not gonna do that), realized I can’t buy cigarettes got coffee instead not thinking much about it. HOLY SHIT. Idk why but this shit is like so fucking strong, I didn’t even drink all of it. My fingers are shaking, my heart is beating, and now I can’t focus because instead of wanting to stay in bed and like disappear now I feel like I’m going to have a fucking heart attack good fucking lord lmaoo. I hate this, wtf is in gas station coffee. Idk if this is anxiety I just didn’t know where to post this lol, okay now to the second part which is genuinely anxiety.

Doctors. I just turned 18, I have not been to the doctor since I was like 10. I always hated going to the doctor as a kid, always was nervous and anxious to go y’know? And when I was around 10 my doctor was arrested (for things they did to other patients, they didnt do anything to me) and since I dont really have medical issues and was always scared of the doctor I didn’t really ever ask to go, but I realize that im pretty sure most kids go like every year or more (maybe my friends just get sick a lot idk). Anyway last night my mom just sprang on me that I need to get a physical exam soon and it’s been really freaking me out (even before the coffee lol) like idk, I never liked going to the doctor and basically I know you should go so in my head I was planning to go to my first doctor visit after graduating college and dragging a friend or something so I would be less nervous or something idk. I just, I don’t wanna go but I know that’s also fucking childish as shit. Idk im just scared of doctors because of several reasons. 1, im scared of like being told “hey bro you’re weird, why tf do you do that it’ll kill you” 2, wow you’re really unhealthy or like overweight, shame on you 3, there’s nothing wrong with you or you’re overreacting to shit stfu.
Idk how doctor visits are even like y’know, I haven’t been in basically a decade. I’ve also never gotten blood drawn and that seems scary as heck too but I know I probably should. I don’t even know who my doctor technically is rn lmao idk the whole thing scares me but I also feel like “hey man you’re an adult this shit shouldn’t fucking bother you, what are you ten?” But then I counter that with “well I haven’t been since I was like ten so I might as well be at that fuckin point” idk, how do people go to the doctor. Im not like dying (I don’t think) so why do I need to go? Idk how do I deal with this anxiety. One answer im not gonna drink coffee from a gas station again lmao.",1,1731274750.0,Anxiety,0,0.99,False

This kiddo is just under 4' and our home is not set up to be very accessible to him. Kitchen cupboards are high, etc. I've got some stools around the house that he makes use of, but I'm wondering if I can do better? And not just in terms of reaching high cupboards... I figure there might be other areas that both me (5'8"") and my own teen (5'11"") may be sort of blind to, that this boy may not feel comfortable bringing up (or is just so used to that he doesn't think of it, either? I get the impression the home he came from was also not super accessible).

I was poking around online and found these hooks to hang coffee mugs under the cabinet, for example. I thought those might be more convenient for him to grab than always moving the stool over when he needed one out of the high cupboard, but still, that's only coffee mugs. I don't particularly want to move all basic dishes to the countertops because we use that space for cooking, and our lower cupboards, which currently house pots and pans etc, are SO low that it doesn't seem like a great solution to just reverse everything, either.  
  
Asking the boy in question what he needs generally just gets me answers like ""nothing"" or reassurance that everything here is ""fine""... and maybe it is? But maybe it can also be better than fine :) So if anyone can suggest any hacks, low-cost home modifications (like, REALLY low cost, LOL), or simple adjustments I can make around here to make things easier to navigate in general for him, I'd really appreciate it!",3,1731274676.0,dwarfism,0,1.0,False

This was after I took my self off Lexipro for about 5 months. I had very little pills left of 5 MG. And decided to slowly to titrate up to 5. I feel like I had bad side effects more than what I remember when I first started 2.5 years ago. When I was running out I got a doc to prescribe me 10 MG. And over 5 days titrated  up to 10 MG. The doom and gloom finally faded and I feel like it’s working and I am 3 days away from it being 3 weeks on 10 MG. I feel like it’s an inch a day progress. When I started on 10 MG. I felt like my anxiety did increase and I used Xanax to help. The side effects I had were ( lethargy, not a deep sleep, super Lucid vivid dreams, feeling a bit jittery so I have been staying off coffee). I feel like the dreams are kind of settling down now. Also some days I feel like it’s working and others I feel like I slipped back a bit. But overall I think it’s slowly working day by day. I just wish it was faster progress. If they say it takes 4 - 6 weeks to feel optimal results then I can expect the benefits to still keep increasing hopefully. If I become emotionally blunted after 6 weeks I won’t care at this point as it may be a relief at least for a while. I have GAD and ADHD and realized I had low level depression for a long time and probably should have been on 10 MG since I started. So with all that said I am trying to see if others can chime in on 4 -6 week mark of the difference they saw at that point. 
On a side note I got Covid a second time in Jan. 2023 and it messed up my brain terribly. I had the worst insomnia of my life and after seeing studies showing people with Long Covid had reduced serotonin so I upped my dose in December of last year to 10 MG. and finally my insomnia when away.

1gobh8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1gobh8w/last_minute_itinerary_check_16_days_in_tokyo/,Last Minute Itinerary Check - 16 Days in Tokyo / Takaosan / Enoshima / Kyoto / Nara / Osaka / Hakone,"Hello! My husband and I (early 30s) were finally able to take time off work and so we made the impulse decision to go to Japan! Our flight is in 2 days and I would love for this incredibly supportive and helpful community help us with assessing our itinerary and give us advice. It will be our first time so we anticipate to do some starter pack Japan. We are very much night-owls and we anticipate our earliest starts are about 10:30 AM. We love checking out the night life, love the outdoors, and though we are foodies I'm not too hung up on having the 'best of the best', since we're doing last minute planning. Trying to balance between relaxing, city life and nature, mixed with yummy food and drinks in between.

This is what we have so far:

**Pre-flight Planning**:

* *Suica cards* \- loaded up on our iPhone
* *Apps* \- Google Translate and Google Maps are downloaded offline
* *Online customs* \- submitted our custom and tax free QR code
* *Yamato Transport* \- we plan to transfer our luggage from Tokyo > Osaka > Tokyo
* *Luggage* \- bringing 1 checked luggage each, and a duffle for our day trips. Plan to buy carry on luggages there for souvenirs
* *Things that we've booked / snagged last minute -*
   * Shibuya Sky
   * TeamLab Borderless
   * Ghibli Museum (I got this a month ago in anticipation we might go)
   * Hakone ryokan at Kowakien Ten-yu
   * Hotels (phew!)
   * No restaurant reservations as of yet

**What We Need Advice On:**

* *Trains and advanced tickets* \- we have no idea which trains tickets to buy between all the sights. Also, should we get the Hakone Freepass if we're coming from Osaka? Do we really need advanced tickets?
* *Osaka -* Not sure how we should split out our time. Should we do Universal Studios?
* *Night life suggestions*? We love to check out unique cocktail bars and EDM shows either in Tokyo or Osaka
* *Itinerary check* \- are our plans too ambitious for a 10:30-11 AM start?

**Itinerary:**

* *Day 1 Wednesday - Arrive in Tokyo (via Narita), Shinjuku*
   * Check into hotel in Shinjuku at 6 PM
   * Lightly explore Shinjuku as I'm fully anticipating jetlag (Golden Gai, etc)
   * Some late night Don Q shopping
* *Day 2 Thursday - Tsukiji, Ginza, teamLab Borderless*
   * Check out Tsukiji Outer Market, grab some food somewhere..
   * Glitch Coffee and Roasters, Ginza
   * Go shopping around Ginza
   * Pokemon Center
   * teamLab Borderless at 6:30 PM
* *Day 3 Friday - Day Trip to Takaosan*
   * Pick one of the hiking trails (probably Trail 1)
* *Day 4 Saturday - Harajuku and Shibuya*
   * Harajuku (Takeshita Street, The Roastery for coffee, general walking around)
   * Shibuya (Crossing, Hachiko, Shibuya Sky, night life activities (*need suggestions!*))
* *Day 5 Sunday - Asakusa and Akihabara*
   * Asakusa (Asakusa Unana, Senso-ji, Nakamise-dori Street)
   * Akihabara (general Chuo-dori street, people watching)
* *Day 6 Monday - Enoshima and Kamakura*
   * Explore the area and vibes\~
* *Day 7 - Tokyo > Kyoto*
   * Check into hotel near Gion
   * Hanamikoji-dori and Pontocho Park
* *Day 8 Wednesday - Kyoto*
   * Fushimi Inari Taisha
   * Sannenzaka, Kiyomizu-dera
   * Ishibe koji road
   * Kodaiji Temple for nightlight viewing
   * Cocktail bars - CRAFT or K36
* *Day 9 Thursday - Kyoto*
   * Arashiyama Bamboo Forest (or Adashino Nenbutsuji)
   * Togetsukyo Bridge for lunch
   * Gyoen National Garden OR Philosopher's Path (more specifically for Ikazuchi Udon)
* *Day 10 Friday - Nara > Osaka*
   * Check out of Kyoto hotel, head to Nara
   * Kakinohasushi, Nakatanidou
   * Kofuku-ji and Todai-ji
   * Nara Park and feed deers along the way
   * Check into hotel near Namba, Osaka
* *Day 11 and 12 Saturday/Sunday - Osaka*
   * This is where we're not sure of, aside from checking out Dotonbori. Do we take one of the days to check out Universal Studios? Should we day trip out? Would love suggestions!
* *Day 13 Monday - Osaka > Hakone*
   * Check in to ryokan in Hakone
   * Enjoy the kaiseki and onsen baths
* *Day 14 Tuesday - Hakone > Tokyo*
   * Explore Hakone in the day time, before heading down to Tokyo
   * Check in to hotel in Ueno

   * Free day
   * Ghibli Musem @ 4 PM
* *Day 16 Thursday - Flight back!*
   * Check out of Ueno hotel
   * Ueno Park
   * Pick up luggage from hotel and head to Narita for 5 PM flight

1gobg6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gobg6u/girl_asked_me_out_and_texted_me_but_after_7texts/,"Girl asked me out and texted me, but after 7texts back and fourth, she already left me on read twice… help me understand it guys ","So I met this really cute girl at a place I had to go to work last thursday. I was doing my work and had casual work related conversations with her, but then she started asking me out about my age, where I‘m from etc. so after most of the work was done, I had a little chat with her and we had a cool vibe going on. So when it was time to leave, I wrote down my phone number on a post-it, shaked her hand and said It was nice meeting you, smiled, and gave her the post-it with my phone number on it and told her „thats for you“.

Friday evening I get a text
 „Helloooo☺️“. 

Its her, I text back „Heyy (name)👋🏽 I really liked you and I‘m happy the post-it worked🤓 how are you? 

Her: „I‘ve just found your number on the post-it🤭, fine how are you?“ 

Me: haha great, I‘m fine aswell, I didn‘t want to ask you out next to your boss lol, I really liked the conversation we had, would you like to grab a coffee and go for a walk sometime? 

She reads the text after 30mins, no response for 17hours, My first thought is, too aggresive lets take out some pace… so i text her „lets put the coffee by side, what do you do on your freetime?“

Her 4h later: „heeeeeyyyyyy, I mostly go out clubbing or to a fancy bar for some drinks with my friends on the weekends, how about yoooouuu😄“

Me the next day since I was at a friends birthday  (got totally hammered)
„Oh nice so you like to go out💃🏻, on the weekends I mostly go out to some nice bars aswell with a group of friends, do you only go out in (city) or anywhere else?“

Her 2h later : „noo from time to time I go out in (different city)“

Me: I‘ve been there 2-3times aswell and I liked it, are there any cool things you do during the week?(indicating any hobby/sport)

After that she left me on read again…
like what is going on? Is she playing hard to get? I took out some pace since the coffee thing was too fast for her I guess, but the second time It‘s a casual question ppl. ask… 
So correct me if I’m wrong, but first of all if she wasn’t interested she wouldn’t ask me out in person and wouldn’t text me in the first place right? 
Any Idea Lady‘s and Gentlemen? 

Thanks

My boss made good impression on me since the job interview, because besides being a good looking person he has a very nice, and charming personality. With time we found out that we have the same interests, reading the same books, magazines and even listing the same podcasts. Automatically, it leads to many conversations as we are both quite clever. I do really enjoy working with him, and he too, as he told me that one day. 

However, some attitudes of him started to concern me. First and foremost, after few months of working I have already received pretty heavy tasks, which requiring a lot of responsibilities. Moreover, my boss is happy with whatever I am doing, and compliment me one on one or in front of the team that sometimes I am feeling a little bit ashamed/uncomfortable. Of course, he is married! 

Very often, when we talk about work-related issues, he ends by asking about our common interests - whether I've already received a subscription to our favourite magazine in the post, or whether I've already started watching the games of our favourite team. In the past, when he came to work with the dog, he invited me several times to his room (when he was alone) to come and play with the dog or to get a coffee if I wanted to. These kinds of suggestions are not made in front of other members of the team. Recently, when we were on our way back together and with another colleague from a business trip, for example, he asked me what system I had for marking quotes in a book. 

I like this type of relationship, but I'm afraid people might start gossiping. I'm good at what I do and I'm glad I've been given more assignments in a short space of time, but I'm afraid that as a young woman I might be wrongly labelled later.  ",1,1731273962.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

So far if I take my medication at like 6 am it does help me get out of bed and have a more productive morning. I’m flossing more and doing more laundry. But that’s the extent of it. And when it wears off I feel awful. Headache. More tired than ever. Pretty much useless which isn’t okay since my husband works late hours and I need to be functional from 5 pm- bedtime with the kids. Plus sleep is impossible I cannot take the medication later. 

Things I was HOPING the medication to help is emotional regulation. I really am striving to be the most calm patient mother out there, and that just is so damn difficult when I’m super overstimulated. I’m still on my phone more than ever. My house isn’t where I would like it to be. Cooking 3 meals a day, meal planning ect is still super difficult. Rejection sensitivity is still at an all time high. Still not exercising at all and when I do I just don’t feel great physically. Still no motivation. Still overeating at night. 

At this point I feel like there’s more cons than pros. It hurts my stomach. The headaches. Dry mouth so bad I even got thrush for the first time at the beginning. I’m wondering did I just have way too high expectations? Am I even ADHD if it didn’t fix my problems? Is it just because I do have a stressful life right now? I also want to note I still drink a cup of coffee in the morning (idk if that’s apart of the issue), and i definitely don’t think I need a higher dose. I feel when it kicks in and if I were to have anymore my anxiety will go crazy. ",1,1731273807.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1gob7ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1gob7ln/my_ode_to_cheap_openear_headset_for_wfh/,My ode to cheap open-ear headset for WFH,"I've been working from home for 8 years. Up until a couple years ago, I suffered from itchy, sweaty and overall tired feeling on my ears every 1hr+ long meeting (rarely a day goes by without one, unfortunately). I tried different headsets over the years, and it did not really matter how exactly they sat, on-ear, or in-ear. Now, before you send me to a doctor, let me assure you there was nothing actually painful or otherwise unhealthy about how it felt. Just increasingly uncomfortable and annoying as the meeting would pass a 30 min mark (or so). I also tried using speakers, which gave mixed results, because different services seem to have noticeably different feedback suppression algorithms, and my wife wasn't happy when I attended meetings where I was just listening most of the time. Also speakers aren't exactly portable when you want to go make a coffee on the kitchen, or you have to take the laptop with you, etc.

Anyway. Somehow, a very cheap set of open-ear BT headphones gave me everything I wanted (beside the low price):

* They don't cover your ears. Enough said, no more itchiness, sweatiness, etc. Of course it also means zero noise suppression, but it's WFH we're talking about, right? So normally it's quiet either way.
* They're lacking in bass and treble, to say the least. Turns out, it's good for speech. Some people have boomy mics, others have ""sibilant"" mics, some are just louder than the rest. The better headphones you have on the receiving end, the worse it is for you. I tried my full-size semi-pro Beyerdynamics a couple times, so I know for sure. Funny thing, some listings for this model advertised ""bone conduction"" for improved bass performance, but of course it's not there. The thing costed about $15.
* They're compact. You don't even feel their presence after a few minutes.
* The charging port is located in a spot where I was able to use a magnetic charging cable without ever removing its attachment from the headset. For a few dollars more, there are models with built-in magnetic charging ports. When the meeting is over, I just take them off and move closer to the charging cable.
* They're a single-piece model without any charging case. There's less ceremony to put them on.

They're not perfect though

* The mic is substandard. It's quiet even though it's right on my head. So I have to use the one built in laptop.
* You have to hold the button for like 3 seconds to wake it up. Could be shorter or may be even automatic.

All in all, I'm happy with this cheap ""sport"" headset for most calls at home. I even use it for podcasts when cycling (it's safer when you can hear noises). And of course, I still have other headphones for other situations, like AirPods for when I'm just not at home, or JBL over-ears for when I want less outside noise.

I'd rather not tell the exact model. But I do urge you to try the same kind if your ears are also as sensitive as mine. Cheap, compact, ""wrap-around"" with headband, ""lack of bass"" in reviews.",1,1731273504.0,WFH,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to buy my first home espresso machine and was set on the gaggia classic e24 ($699 + tax) but then saw a used Ascaso Dream for sale for $600 on facebook.

The Dream was bought in 2020 and has a PID kit with it that I can install myself. I’m not 100% sure which model it is, but from looking around I think it might be the Dream Up V3. 

I’m trying to decide which machine to buy. The new Ascaso dream PIDs are like $1200-$1400 from what I’ve seen, so this feels like a really good deal. But also the machine isn’t new and it’s not the PID version.

With the E24, I’d buy it new so I’d have warranty and all that if needed. I also think I prefer the look of this one, but I might ball out and get the wooden accents, making it $809 + tax.

Then as I was doing research today, I’ve seen the Lelit Anna recommended since it comes stock with PID and pressure gauge, but it has a 57 mm portafilter.

Anyways, any insight is super appreciated! I usually make one latte each morning, but plan to have “coffee shop mornings” with my friends where I make them coffee and we all hang out (coffees don’t have to be made in quick succession though).

I worked at a coffee shop for like 3 years so I know how to pull good shots and steam, but I’ve never had a home machine so I’m not sure what’s important. My friend is an espresso machine technician so she can help me with any repairs/upgrades, but I don’t want to have to sink hundreds of dollars into upgrading, if I could’ve just started with a better version (I say this now…)

Then, a few days later, I took a photo of a coffee table at my friends apartment and there was a vinyl on the coffee table and the album was by THE EXACT musician my crush and I were discussing. It was an older album I personally haven’t heard of. I put this photo on my instagram story (still not realizing who made the album in the photo) and my crush of course saw my stories. I haven’t spoken with him since. (I’m a female btw) It’s eerie because the musician is also kind of obscure. 

I’m only realizing now that the album is by who we discussed and my brain turned into a hamster wheel, I started assuming my crush thinks I posted it to get his attention and that it came off as creepy, blah blah blah. None of that was intentional on my end. Lol.

Looks like America had our own dark story stranger than fiction this week. Anyway, let's get on with the summary of the stories “Hunger” through “Night in the Chrysalis.”

**Hunger by Phoenix Boudreau**

An unnamed entity is always hungry. It was almost erased in memory. It is the embodiment of the need and want of food. Empty People could be a vessel for it to eat. It deceives. A frat house with six arrogant men is its next target. It enters an intoxicated man who sees a girl of the People named Summer. 

The man it possessed is named Chris. She feels uneasy around him. She calls a friend to say she's leaving the party. Both man and entity stalk her through the park. She is on her phone and hears a sharp whistle through the trees. Summer smiles at them and smells of sacred medicines. 

She fights Wehtigo with a cedar branch. Her friend Rain joins her to fight him by joining branches in their hands and sprinkling tobacco, sage, cedar, and sweetgrass. Wehtigo is trapped for the first time ever but tries to escape. They light sage and cedar to drive it out of Chris’s body. It rages up into the sky. Chris comes to and is confused and tells her she's uninvited to the parties. He'll never know they saved him and would think it's his due anyway. The Wehtigo is gathering its strength to hunt again. 

**Tick Talk by Cherie Dimaline**

Bilson, aka Son, was raised in Toronto and left for the states as soon as he could. Florida to Georgia then New Orleans. NOLA promised to be a fun place to work and party. He lived there for two years in a haze. His aunt Beatrice called him to say his mom passed away. He goes back home to Toronto. 

His cousin suggests he see his father. It's another trip farther north to a rural area. His dad looked older and said few words. The land was in his family since the English gave it to his ancestors for loyal service in the [War of 1812.](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca%2Fen%2Farticle%2Ffirst-nations-in-the-war-of-1812&utm_campaign=aga&utm_source=agsadl2%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) They spent the winter quietly. In the spring, his father thawed out his voice. He wished to go hunting but waited for his son to agree to go with him. Son still held a grudge from childhood that his father was stuck in the old ways. 

Summer comes then the fall. They could go hunt for deer and rabbits. One day his dad didn't wake up. Then Son decides to go hunt. He packs his dad's truck and drives north. The cabin is simple and secure. In the woods, he feels he has to prove something. He sees no animals in the two hours he is there. He stomps off to the cabin to sleep.

He wakes up sweaty and undresses to find a tick on his belly. He can't find the tweezers. It keeps getting bigger. He could take a knife and cut it out. He trips on the clothes he shed and hits his head. He has a vision of his father and howling coyotes. His dad tells Son the coyotes are there for him because he has forgotten. An owl in real life hoots at him and peers in the window. Son wakes up with a massive headache. 

The tick is as big as a lightbulb. Son thrashes around in agony. His hand closes over a knife on the floor. He stabs it then has to cut it from his skin. The tick is thrown somewhere in the room. He puts his clothes back on and swim-crawls to the door and feels his way to the truck. He is light-headed and has to laugh at his predicament. He sounds like a coyote. Son drives home. In the truck bed, something that is bloody skitters around. 

**The Ones Who Killed Us by Brandon Hobson**

Soldiers ran away from the risen corpses of the ones who killed natives. Government wagons from the [Trail of Tears](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTrail_of_Tears&utm_campaign=aga&utm_source=agsadl2%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) sit in town. Women disappeared in the river. Women had hidden in the barn. One of their shadows remained. They let the old lame Grey Horse go. 

The undead soldiers gathered by the river. The narrators watch them. They see an owl and ignore the omen. There will be no reconciliation. The general got drunk and bragged that he was behind their slaughter. They play a game with five stones. The missing women made little fires that encircled the passed out general. They attacked the men and drove them into the river.

Peter goes for a hike at the [Four Corners](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fen.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFour_Corners_Monument&utm_campaign=aga&utm_source=agsadl2%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) in the oppressive heat of July. He's only doing it for his cousin Maddie who invited him and their uncle to her graduation. Peter misses Alaska and the cold of paddling in a kayak. Maddie's boyfriend, Adam, is white and enthusiastic about hiking and the Utah [petroglyphs](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visitutah.com%2Fplan-your-trip%2Frecommended-itineraries%2Fancient-petroglyphs-pictographs&utm_campaign=aga&utm_source=agsadl2%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) nearby. He touches them, but Peter warns him not to because the oil from human skin ruins the rock. 

Adam is disrespectful and accuses Peter of gatekeeping his culture. Peter just doesn't want him to touch them. He wouldn't like it if Peter touched the Mona Lisa. The rock art is ugly anyway. Maddie apologizes for her boyfriend's behavior and words. Adam retaliates by scratching his car keys across the rock. They fight, and Peter throws Adam into the river. 

Maddie tells them to stop it and hurry up because it's a five mile hike back to the car. Adam panics because he lost the car keys (shouldn't have used them to deface the cliffs there, dude). They look for them while Peter offers some ground corn to the cliffs. Maddie cools her feet, arms, and back in the river. If they follow the river, they can make it back even in the dark. 

Peter makes a torch out of a stick, desert brush, and a strip of his shirt. But where did Adam go? He had taken off his shoes and was kicking the sand thinking it was the ocean. Maddie took off her shoes to reveal swollen blisters and green pus on her feet. It covers her entire body. She sits against a tree, and she hears a child laugh. 

Peter wonders how they can even get back now. Adam's stomach was bloated like he was pregnant. Maddie's face is green with pus and tears. Adam goes on about a curse. Maddie accuses Peter of the same. No, don't be so ignorant! Adam's stomach pulses with contractions. This all has to be a dream. Something was pushing through Adam's belly like a bird pecking its way out of an egg. A rattlesnake emerges and slithers onto the sand. 

Adam picks up the snake by the tail and says hi. He puts the inert snake in his pocket and crawls into the bushes to hunt a rat. He emerges with a rat in his mouth like a cat. The snake comes to life and snaps at the rat and his fingers. It's dawn now, so they should head back. Adam takes “his baby” with him in his cargo pants pocket. 

They meet their uncle, Maddie's dad, and two park rangers on the trail. Maddie's dad looks at her scars with distress and Adam's wound with disgust. The snake bites one of the park rangers as she tries to help Adam. The other ranger calls for an ambulance to meet them. 

The uncle takes Peter aside and accuses him of using magic on them. He swears he didn't. Besides, Adam broke federal law by defacing a monument and upsetting the ancestors. Peter took the car keys out of his pocket and could use a coffee on the way to the hospital. 

**Before I Go by Norris Black**

Davey Church had fallen from a cliff and died. Kiera would like to think the weather was bad when it happened. She returns to where it happened and questions why she came. The wind whistles through the trees. Her phone rings. It's her dad who is worried about her. He's horrified that she returned to the place of death. The line goes dead. 

Kiera makes it to her tent before sunset. She reads a paperback book in her sleeping bag. Davey used to  interrupt her reading with stories about his day. She misses him so much. She falls asleep and has nightmares about him. An undead battered Davey opens the tent, and she feels his cold broken body against hers. Then she wakes up screaming. Her tent is open, and her legs are scratched up. She left the lantern on all night. 

In the morning, she packed up and set out. But she must see one more glimpse of the scene of death. An old woman with two braids and a shawl is sitting at the top of the hill. She knows her name and tells Kiera to let him go. She shouldn't call him back. She's stirring up things that she should let be. Kiera wipes away tears, and the woman disappears.

She pitches her tent yet again and spends one more night there. Her lantern dies, and the Moon is the only light. A large head with white skin and dark lips peeks in the tent flap. She tells her that Davey is ready to see her. Kiera follows her blindly up the hill. The figure is seven feet tall with a cloak made of bloody crow’s wings. Who is she? The Night Mother, of course. Death herself. Dying people usually utter her name.

Behind her cloak lies an abyss with the broken body of Davey. He asks why she is there? She shouldn't be here at all. Kiera stumbles over the cliff, falls, and lands broken at the bottom. Her last thoughts are of deaths she remembered until Night Mother comes to take her away. 

**Night in the Chrysalis by Tiffany Morris**

Cece wakes up when she hears a woman's voice in the next room. She investigates and finds a bundle of sticks tied with string shaped like a person. She just moved into the building after a miscarriage and a breakup. Her aunt Deb won't answer the phone. She told the house she was harmless. 

She smells blood and rotten meat at the foot of the stairs. She remembers her grandmother giving her a doll that she made dance. She explained away the other doll as the doings of a lonely girl like she used to be. 

She has another night terror where the walls grow fungi and a voice talks about dead man's fingers. She goes upstairs and tries to turn on her laptop and phone. Dead. The voice starts up again. A woman with voids for eyes appears and tells her to get out of her house! Cece can't open the door. The house feels alive with its own viscera. Cece tastes blood and passes out. 

She wakes up to a dollhouse replica of the house. A moth is stuck in the small bedroom. A doll-eyed girl sits in a rocking chair. The woman will make Cece her doll, and she can live in the safe and cozy world of the dollhouse. She starts to shrink and turn to porcelain. Things are rotting. Cece overturns the dollhouse in her rage. She crushes maggots under her arms. The house dies.

The regular sized house returns to its normal shape and size. The sun is coming up.

I’m a frequent lucid dreamer, but this past week I had an experience that was unlike anything I’ve encountered before. I wanted to share it here to see if anyone else has had something similar, or if anyone has insights into what this might mean. This dream was deeply surreal, intense, and emotional.

The environment felt laid-back, yet charged with energy. It was an abstract, dreamlike place—distant lights glowing in the background and an overwhelming sense of movement around me. There were plenty of couches and chairs scattered throughout, with people lounging and socializing. Everyone felt engaged in their own world, but there was a collective sense of ease and peace. Despite the tranquil vibe, there was a palpable energy that seemed to hum around me, like the calm before something profound.

There was no sense of urgency here, but I definitely felt like I had a purpose, like I was meant to be there, but also that there was still work to do. Some of the other people around me seemed to be in a similar state of limbo—like they weren’t fully aware of where they were or what was going on. It almost felt like a waiting room for souls, or some kind of transition space.

The most striking part of this dream was the sensory experience. For the first time in a lucid dream, I could *feel* objects in a way that felt completely real. I ran my fingers over several objects that were placed on a small coffee table—a metallic prism, a bumpy and scaly pyramid, smooth spheres, and even a soft, fuzzy bench. The sensation started as a faint vibration in my fingertips, but as I concentrated, the textures became vivid and clear. It felt almost like the dream world was syncing with my mind, like I was remembering the sensations of these objects and then instantly experiencing them.

This was surreal, but also exciting. It was almost as if the more I focused on the textures and the objects, the more my sensory perception expanded. I could feel the roughness of the pyramid, the cool metallic feel of the prisms, and the softness of the couch. My heart rate quickened as I realized how real these sensations were—this wasn’t just a vivid dream; it felt as if I was actually interacting with the objects.

Despite my excitement about the tactile sensations, I still had trouble moving around the space. I’ve always had trouble using my legs in dreams—I tend to float, fly, or drift instead of walking. The guide who had been with me suggested that I try using my legs to kick a large orb, about the size of a beach ball, which others around me were also trying to move with their legs. Some succeeded, some failed, but I couldn’t manage to move the ball at all. It felt like my body wasn’t entirely cooperating with my intentions, which is common for me in dreams when I get scared or try to force certain movements.

When I tried to feel my legs or move them, I couldn’t get a sense of physicality from them. It was like they were there but not connected to my sense of self. I could sense my body in a general way, but my legs felt like foreign appendages, almost like they were still sleeping or not fully engaged. I wondered if this disconnection was symbolic of my sense of being where the focus wasn’t on my physical form but on my consciousness itself.

Then, the guide brought me to someone who approached me—a stranger, but someone I felt an inexplicable connection to—and gave me a hug. This part of the experience is still haunting me. There was a deep sense of connection, almost like this person and I shared something on a soul level. But at the same time, I couldn’t understand who they were, nor could I feel anything physically. The hug was emotionally charged, yet completely detached from any physical sensation. I knew this person had some kind of connection to me, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The frustration of not being able to fully communicate or connect with them left me feeling strangely sad, like I was missing something important.

Behind me, the guide who had been observing me throughout the experience was still there, watching this exchange. I couldn’t hear their voice, but I could sense their presence—calm, patient, and maybe even a little protective. I wasn’t sure if this guide was the same male figure who had visited me in previous dreams, but I felt a deep sense of trust with them, as if I knew they had my best interests at heart.

At one point, I asked the guide if this place was the afterlife. Their response caught me off guard: “Yes, but it’s more complicated than that.” This answer lingered in my mind. I had asked the same question to another guide in a previous dream, a female figure, and her response was far more dismissive—she seemed angry, like I wasn’t supposed to ask such questions. That response had immediately triggered my waking, but this time, the guide’s tone was measured and serious, almost like they were giving me a glimpse into something I wasn’t fully prepared for.

I was left with the sense that there was something deeply important about this place, something beyond simple life or death. The way the guide spoke suggested that if I continued down this path of questioning, I might be crossing into a realm I wasn’t ready for—perhaps a permanent crossing over. The weight of their words made me feel uneasy, like I was approaching a boundary I couldn’t un-cross.

Just after that exchange, I was ready to leave. I felt like I needed to return to my body, but there was also a sense that I hadn’t completed something in this space, that I was being pulled back before I’d finished my work here. There was a feeling of unfinished business, like I was still supposed to learn something, or maybe like I had to confront something before I could leave. But I woke up soon after, feeling disoriented and emotionally raw.

As I came back to my physical body, I was left with an unsettled feeling. I knew I had experienced something significant, but I still couldn’t grasp what it all meant. The sensations were so vivid, the emotional connections so strong, and the sense of the “afterlife” so real, that I can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to explore here.

This lucid dream has left me with a lot to unpack. The sensations I experienced, especially the tactile ones, felt unlike anything I've ever encountered before. It was as though the dream world was syncing with my mind in a way I hadn’t experienced, making the objects feel almost *too* real. I still can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to this, some deeper layer to explore, but I’m not entirely sure what that is yet.

The vividness of touch and the emotional weight of the connection with the stranger I met in the dream—along with the sense of being in a place between worlds—are still with me. I’m left wondering if this was a glimpse into a transition space, or if it was a more profound exploration of consciousness itself. Whatever it was, I can’t help but feel like I’m only scratching the surface.

Has anyone else had lucid dreams where the sensory details were so real they felt like waking life? Or where the feeling of touch seemed almost to extend beyond the dream? I’m curious if anyone has had a similar experience or if you have any thoughts on what might be happening here.

1goaubf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1goaubf/we_are_all_tired_of_this_anxiety/,We are all tired of this anxiety. ,"I’m tired of this anxiety. Feeling weird symptoms, having to go to bed extra early just to try and fall asleep to get the symptoms to go away. Having to try different medicine to help with it. Stomach issues, physical symptoms and feeling dizzy the days after.. 

I’ve been suffering for a couple years now. The first year I went to the ER 4 times just to be told nothing is wrong… the second year I went 3 times until the very last time I went a doctor finally told me she thinks I have anxiety and prescribed me hydroxyzine to take when I felt the symptoms pop up. That helped a bit. Knowing I wasn’t actually dying yet. These weird symptoms weren’t a heart attack like google was saying it might be. I’m tired of having to suddenly cancel things because I’m feeling dizzy and don’t feel comfortable driving like that. Tired of family and people not really understanding what’s going on. Tired of feeling like less of a man because of this stupid anxiety that seems to happen for no reason and knock me on my ass for the next day or four. 

I think it all started for me some time after my mom passed and my dad re married. Having to then shortly after finish school on my own (was homeschooled…) and then find a job and move out. After finding out this was anxiety I managed to change my diet. A carnivore diet worked for me but I think it was mostly cutting out the sugar and caffeine and then nicotine. I lost weight and felt great but then my dog who was my mother’s dog had to be put down. She lived a very long and great life for her breed but after that I went back to my old habits. Eating junk food. Energy drinks and coffee. Vaping again… and what do you know all my anxiety and symptoms have come back even bigger and harder than ever. 

If you read this then thank you, it’s long but it feels better to rant to people who might understand. I’m going to be trying to beat this again. I know it’s possible, I’ve done it once. If you guys have anything that helps you please share below. Especially any natural or over the counter things that seem to help you. For me hot showers whenever I feel something starting up and alka seltzer plus cold/flu helps me (not recommending you take it though it just seems to help me. ) what helps you guys?

My name is Mariana, I'm a brazilian trans girl, 21yo, and after having several diagnosis and treatment proposals during my life, I've self diagnosed me with cPTSD. I will not enter the rollecoaster that my life has been, but I need some advice. I tried to remove some medicines I take, with my psychiatrist approval, and it went bad. Several things happened, my dad beat the shit out of me less than 1 month ago and, in different moments, both my dad and my mom threatened to expell me from home. Now I'm considering sex work or suicide if that happens. Anyway, I talked to them several times, and today my dad at least pretended to take accountability on what he has done my whole life. My mom already took, but she is tired of my meltdowns.

Today was the first day in several days that I didn't have a crying attack, even though I cried a little. I can not continue to be emotionally dependent of my parents, my family that lives nearby is extremely transphobic and the part of my family that isn't lives far away. I left college to study to medicine school admission tests, and I have a chance to restart my social life again, with new people with the same objectives. I restarted therapy last week, everything is going well. I just need 2 things: appropriate medicine for cPTSD and friends, so I can rely on other people than my close family. The point is: How do I do it?

How do I make friends when I can't barely have a talk without traumadumping or even have a talk at all? All I do is go to the preparatory course and have samples of talks with people, I don't have the strength to socialize. I need someone to go out and watch a movie in the cinema or take a coffee break, but I'm too afraid to even get close to people. What should I do?",2,1731272427.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False
1goarnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1goarnk/dutch_and_british_cuisine_are_mediocre_because/,Dutch and British cuisine are mediocre because folks are more in a rush to cook and eat.,"British and Dutch cuisine aren't really all that appreciated worldwide, there are very few restaurants, many people hardly even think about it.

When we spend time in these countries, we see that many people eat foreign cuisine, both the locals and even tourists. Outside of beer production and some snack foods, Britain and the Netherlands aren't really very strong in terms of their cuisine.

Contrast the Netherlands with Belgium and you'll see that it is a country that both cultivates foreign ingredients and still tries to experiment in its kitchens.

Why I think this is the case is because in Britain and Netherlands people are much more likely to be busy with something other than eating and cooking. Food is certainly appreciated but as a society it doesn't seem like a top priority, this is very different from Italy, Greece, and France, for example, that puts a ton of attention not only in cooking but also to the lunching and dining experience.

I mean it's no surprise that these countries just have more restaurants worldwide, why French and Italian terms are all over contemporary restaurant culture.

But France and Italy didn't just come up with good food out of nowhere, for them the banqueting experience was just something more important, something you spend more time doing.

In Britain and Netherlands folks really just drink tea/coffee and 'grab a bite'. Dutch cheese can be good, of course, but the country doesn 't really aspire to be known for specialties.

When we were bf/gf for 3years, sinabi ko yun sakanya na never ever lay hands on each other. Yun yung always ko nireremind. And even in my previous relationships, never ko naranasan yun. I'm also very cautious to this because I grew up watching my mom and dad fighting, shouting and hurting each other from time to time. And I've also witnessed my sister and his partner fighting and hurting each other physically. For me it's not very ideal because it shows how much you respect one another.

Unfortunately, early this year, my husband got so drunk and left us (me and my baby) in a family gathering alone. It was a festival in our town, where there'd be so many drunk people on the street and the transpo is hard. I was so furious that he was inconsiderate in leaving us and not even checking on us to get home safe. Also, it was a gathering on his side of family na sobra akong na-OP kasi wala ako masyadong kilala that much sa relatives niya aside from the immediate family. Kaya sobra sobra yung galit ko to the point na sinaktan ko siya physically.

And i regret doing that.
From there, I was so mindful when i get so mad when we fight. Nilalayo ko sarili ko talaga.
Minsan, dinadaan ko sa gamit para may paglabasan ako ng galit ko.

Few days ago,
My husband and I had been acting cold for like 3 days because of petty arguments. Then comes another day where we had petty argument that led to a big fuss and had him suddenly kick me on my tummy out of nowhere. Hindi yun sobrang lakas pero hindi rin siya mahina para hindi maramdaman yung sakit.

I was triggered so much that I went back to him... and the story goes on.

I cried so much that night.

It's been 2 days and I still cry thinking about it.

Hindi ko alam kung ano mararamdaman ko.

He was so sorry and is making an effort about it. He cooks food for us everyday. He still makes my coffee. Kahit hindi ko siya kinakausap. I still insist on letting him live away from me and my baby pero hindi siya umaalis, though I've seen from his Facebook search that he was looking for a ""room for rent"". 

Feeling ko traumatized ako.
Feeling ko hindi na maibabalik yung dati naming pagsasama.

I even considered his feelings, ganito rin ba naramdaman niya nung una ko siyang sinaktan physically and verbally from few months ago?
By that, may karapatan ba ako ma-trauma at masaktan sa ginawa niya ngayon?

Hindi ko alam. Ang alam ko lang sobra akong nasaktan.

 I was scrolling through different fragrance related subs and there are so many posts on gourmands, freshies and all kinds of scents and how it makes people feel a certain way and their individual takes on it but I don't really find posts related to people's takes on melancholia and how they associate it with olfactory experiences. 

So, maybe imagine a rainy/cold winter afternoon, a person (don't really feel like assigning a gender to them. it's the reader's choice) in a black coat, black wide leg trousers and a white tucked in shirt. they're scanning the street, standing outside their university gate but their mind is elsewhere. it's already crossed continents and wants to share a cigarette with this friend they want to grow old with or read a piece of classic literature to but, instead, they get a text from that friend sharing about how the coffee date went well with someone they met and a cold breeze passes by, not stopping for anyone as this person crosses the road, faintly smelling the aroma of hot piping tea at a nearby stall and the aptly complimenting aroma of a late afternoon rain.

I'm planning to invest in a Nespresso machine and could use some advice on picking the right one. Here’s what I’m considering:

Coffeeza Nespresso machine

Unique Nespresso machine

Agaro Nespresso machine

De'Longhi Nespresso machine (Original or Inissia models)

My top pick so far is the Coffeeza Nespresso machine – it’s the one I’m leaning toward the most, but I’m open to feedback on any of these options.

Here are my questions:

1. Taste Consistency: If I use the same Nespresso capsule in all these machines, is there any noticeable difference in taste or brew quality? Or would the coffee taste pretty much the same across all machines?
.
.
2. Durability & Longevity: Out of these, which machine would you say is the most durable and likely to last a long time? I’m looking for a reliable model that can handle regular use without issues.
.
.
3. Ranking Suggestions: How would you rank these machines based on your experiences or knowledge? I’m looking to make a choice that balances taste, build quality, and value for money.
.
.
Thanks in advance for your insights! Your input will definitely help me make the best choice, and I'm excited to step up my coffee game with the right machine. ☕

today we were riding to buy something and I asked again, he said again something like “idk, why is it even important” and I asked why does he hides it from me. and he started screaming at me saying why the f%ck don’t I shut up with my stupid questions and he cancelled plans and drove car back home and said he wants me to move away (I’m in my masters degree and he knows that I don’t have any money or places to move to) and I tried to talk why this happened and something like that happened a week ago and now we are arguing repeatedly.. and he was just silent while I was sitting on the floor crying, saying I don’t get what do you want from me, I don’t know. I was begging just to talk with me but he repeatedly said “I don’t know. I don’t know what should we discuss. it’s nothing to discuss here”.
so I managed to stay home and tried to talk to him again as he started to act like he is depressed (just laying in dark room scrolling his phone) and.. he said everything this again, said I made everything wrong and forced him to that condition, it’s my fault, and after me trying to say sorry and asking what can I do to help him feel better he said to don’t touch him or talk to him if i don’t want to fight. now I’m laying crying and room while he now feels ok and drinks coffee watching something on his notebook… well

When I did wash it, I noticed these light blue stains on it that wouldn’t rinse out. I rubbed some Dawn on and threw it in the wash. Didn’t come out! Soaked it overnight in Oxyclean and washed. Nothing. Looked up an old thread on here and tried a mixture of Dawn/vinegar and putting baking soda on. Didn’t do anything either.

A few months ago I got my hair colour done. I hated what the hairdresser did, she got it totally wrong. She took on board my concerns and fixed it for me the next day and it was perfect. I was extremely grateful and thanked her. I also tipped her because I felt bad about the whole thing. 

On the way in I saw a girl leaving with a really great haircut, I told her I loved it and she suggested I come back when my hair grows a bit more and she can recreate it and I agreed. 

A couple of months later (the other day) I went back. She told me she remembered the cut she did that day and said she’d recreate it, no problem. 

So, she washed my hair and only shampooed it once. You should always shampoo hair twice! I’ve never had a hairdresser shampoo my hair only once. 

She also never offered me tea, coffee or even a glass of water which irked me after not even having my hair washed properly. I started thinking gosh, hairdressers are supposed to be warm and welcoming and this doesn’t feel it at all. 

Halfway through the cut I realised she was NOT giving me the cut I asked for. At all. She had given me a totally different cut. I started to freak out but tried to stay calm. I then blurted out “oh god. I’m not sure, this isn’t really the cut I had in mind.”

She looked SO angry. She turned off the hairdryer, basically slammed down the brush and said “well I’m nearly done now.” I felt sick and like I wanted to cry. As it was nearly done I said “actually, I think it’s really nice.” Because I was so anxious and upset by how she was being with me. She then said “oh that’s good. Because I was thinking, it’s not like I can glue it back on.”

I paid and left, and was close to tears the whole way home. I hate the haircut, but that’s not the problem. I take responsibility for not showing her a picture and expecting her to remember the cut I wanted. 

It’s the way I was treated that’s the problem. She was so rude and angry and I felt so anxious. I am convinced she just thinks I’m a Karen or a trouble maker because that’s the second issue I raised, when that’s not true at all. It was such an upsetting experience and I haven’t been able to get it out of my head. 

I emailed the salon to say I’d had a terrible experience and wanted to cancel my next appointment (I booked a toner). Her girlfriend works on admin and said your appointment is booked, sorry to hear you had a bad experience. That was it.

I am SO angry about it all and thinking of calling and speaking with the manager. It’s rare for me to complain like this, I am definitely not a Karen.

How would you handle this ??,"I have been a server at my work for 10 years and there has been an issue looming since last year. Here is a bit of the backstory,  Julie worked the day shift I worked the evening shift,  this is a small restaurant with a small staff we run with 3 severs winter and 4 in the summer. Julie and I worked at the restaurant the longest so I had made it known to Julie and the boss that if she ever left I would like her Friday day shift so after years of working together Julie gives notice that she is leaving at the end of summer , so I remind the boss that I would like her Friday shift he says OK and we will have a meeting with the other girls as when Julie leaves there will be 3 of us left and my boss says he will let me pick the shift I would like first then the other girls can pick one I said ok great , but the meeting keeps getting put off. In the meantime a server that has been there 4 years we will call her Cathy had covered a few shifts for Julie barks up to the boss that she is taking both of the available shifts when he said to her I could choose a shift she said ""no Julie gave then to me and I am keeping them both of them or I will quite"" he informs me of this I said ""that is not fair I have been here the longest now she is being unreasonable"" Boss says ""leave it with me I will talk to her"" I said Ok. He did not want me to say anything to Cathy as he does not want any arguments.
I keep asking through out the year when are we having this meeting about the Friday shift,  I will talk to her he says. Now fast forward the year, Cathy had to take time off medical issue about 8 weeks ago myself and the other server cover Cathy's shifts, this is when we find out from regular customers that Cathy does not charge them for items as in their coffee and some food items as she is supposed to, also not following policies on daily specials which is by one and 2 beverages and get the other half price, she does not have them buy beverages , so now when we are covering her shifts customers are getting mad at us for following company policies and changing them for their coffee and having them buy beverages with the special so in turn customers take it out on us Cathy does not charge us so we are not tipping you now because we are mad. 
We approach the boss about this and he says i will take care of her when she gets back, then I bring up again let's have this meeting with Cathy before she returns to discuss the Friday shift and get this all sorted out  he says OK then just writes  up new schedule puts me on the Friday I said we should have a meeting about it he said she was being greedy here I put you in the shift,  I felt uncomfortable without a meeting but said ok thanks, she comes in for something and sees the new schedule and flips out ""Friday day is my shift"" Cathy says I hear the Boss say don't worry I will fix it, she leaves. Cathy has 5 shifts since she took the 2 that we did not have the meeting about, I have 3 and asked for the Friday day which would give us both 4 shifts each
Now keep in mind the Friday night shift I have worked for 10 years and I wanted to add the Friday days shift that was Julie's which Cathy took.
I said to the boss I am willing to compromise with Cathy can have my night shift and I will take the day then she is still at 5 and I am still at 3, I don't like to cause drama at work, do my job and go home but Cathy is a demanding loud mouth she is still refusing to let me have Friday.

1goae4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_notwhoyouneedmetobe/comments/1goae4c/cosmic_flushes/,Cosmic flushes.,"I gave up my kid at one point a long time ago because my son's father could provide in many, many ways that I couldn't. While there were many issues with the reality of that situation and how it actually went into practice, the theory was still sound. I still did what was best at that time. 

When the reality became what it would, when ""all the cards"" were actually laid out, I had to figure out a bunch of shit really really fast. That whole debacle took 2 years to settle out, and in some ways- things I've hinted at being my current issues in relation to all that, as well as a few others that I've not openly explored on here, it is still lightly on-going, but that's an important thing. Lightly. 

There were a series of intense hurdles I had to overcome to get boy back. The list is long. I'm pretty sure I've spoken about this particular time a few times on here... I was living with a boyfriend of mine that would leave me the weekend I got my kid back in a house away from everyone I knew (he was cheating, long story, I was very lucky when his family felt sorry and made him help with that first month's rent,) I had to get my workplace to let me switch shifts, find a new place to live, find child care, incurred a bunch of new debts again (fun story about all that)...enrolled boy in one kindergarten just to switch him to another when we moved, my kid was fucking upset and confused and had been subsisting off of... man. That's a long story and I don't need to go into it right now. That's not the point of my writing at this moment. 

I do know I've spoken about this before, because it was during this time period that I decided I kind of did have a god, and what it was was just everything in existence that was beyond control. The unknowable. 

My mother was of mixed help around then. She suggested I leave my kid with his father and that it was probably best for him, so that sucked. But she also gave me the phrase ""cosmic flush."" When everything that can go wrong does and it feels like the universe is putting all of it on you and essentially you have to start off from the bottom again. 

Things have dramatically improved, things have stayed the same. 

I could innumerate some of the changes, but again, not the point of me writing right now. 

I have come to love my cosmic flushes. They're valuable teachers, for sure. I know the idea of making improvements and changes while things are good, but it makes sense to me that some things don't show how bad they are until you're forced to deal with their explosion. I can't go backwards and make myself smarter. I can learn what I will, and apply that information from now on. If I didn't learn it well enough, then it will keep exploding as long as I continue to create those circumstances that hold that potentiality. 

Bright lights. Flashy bits, you know. The same shit I always say other than when I don't. 

I can't help that I'm fifty people right now. 200 people. 150? I've heard differing numbers over the years. 

My mother also told me about villages. I learned that when I was very young. My family's kitchen table, as I know I've said on here before, used to be a gathering place for my mom and stepdads AA or college friends where they would drink coffee into the night and have debates. That table is in my kitchen now. There is a stick figure drawing with a rainbow above it on the underside of the table that I did when I was younger than my boy. I used to be desperate to listen to what they had to say. I would hid against the wall under there. They were likely humoring me by letting me stay. 

Wonder if that holds some of my ""want to curl and hide in a low space"" or ""wanting to go *home*"" feeling I get when I'm desperately anxious. 

...

I have known, on and off, how I cannot control the world around me. Arm-length span of control. It is an act of futility to consider otherwise. Why absurdity was very natural for me to adopt. Sometimes I lose perspective and get too attached again. I suspect I did that with this election, but I also know that's not entirely true. Note the entirely. 

I had faith like an idiot. Hahahha. 

Every proceeding level of reality will be what it is. Meet it or fall....well, no where, you're still here, just underprepared. Feels like that follows the same line of thinking that I use when people accuse others of being disingenuous by emulating others.  They're still being themselves, even if they're affecting being someone else, too. It's still their body doing the carrying out of its will, even when it's adopted, un-worked-through will. 

But every new moment is all you get to experience until it is the next new moment, so on and so forth. Compiling information, practice for the new. Ain't that cute. Brains. Flashy lights. Fun stuff. 

I sometimes see people do amazing things and feel inadequate,  and I hope that I continue to get faster at responding to myself with ""meh. If you wanted to, you would."" Or ""there is no need of comparison when not shit matters. Enjoy their flashy lights. Be proud of them."" 

Education, getting educated, watching others being educated or getting educated allows for plenty of practice at not thinking about my own failings and I just get to revel in how amazing humans can be. But maybe I do need to combine the differing thoughts per setting more... maybe they already are, lead pipe on that front has muted itself halfway to singularity. 

Used to be so loud and ineffective. 

Not so bad now. And the emotional value of that is more...defined. Though, maybe I'm thinking about this right now because I need to redefine it again. Reevaluate the boundaries again. 

Maybe I don't care. 

I lost my political side some the more I came to terms with how little control I have, and have since gained some of it back... I got to so bad a point... 

Practice, practice, practice. ""My father and I study war and politics so that my son can..."" not verbatim. 

Too much control? Not affecting enough? 

Both. Reevaluation. But... yeah, there is no end. I am ""evil,"" I gave birth to someone else's suffering. Mmmmmm.... too much value. There is no real value. There is success and there is failure. My stupid fucking lunch line/box of chocolates...parable? What are those? Anecdotes. Been a while since I thought about those ones.  

Gave birth. Oooh. Yeah. Ineffable. Life is a continuous stream of negatives applied to wavering positive static till ""death"".

I want to give my kid a ridiculous amount of credit. He made a FUCKED up grade this past week or so. If it was a multiple choice test, and he has guessed randomly, statistically speaking, he would have gotten a higher grade than what he did. 

He's grounded. Life is better in our house when I take away his normal choices for entertainment. He's happier, I'm happier, it's funny. Something something, self-moderation. Wee. 

But I pestered him about his test. 

He's in all honors classes. 

And....he's learning shit that I'm learning now. 

He was doing bloody law of conservation of energy shit last I looked in his folder. I'm *literally* doing that in my classes. 

But this was a slightly older test, had to do with cells, plant and human.  

He got a SHIT grade, and I was berating him, and he said something that sounded like utter horse-shit at first. ""I got almost everything right, she just marked it wrong because I spelled them wrong!"" 

I was skeptical. Massively. Then he starts talking about shit *I* don't even know about....and he's right. He really does know. 

I wonder if I was learning those things then and just didn't retain it... around his age, they tried me in an advanced math class but... I didn't want to be in there and didn't try and they didn't put me in the second level the next year. My kid... he doesn't want to do it, either. I hate the idea of forcing him...but then I look at the ""grounded"" situation. He begrudgingly *loves* the extra care. I suspect I would have too. I've said that about the lax nature of my childhood....which, from the other side, is explained by saying ""You guys were hell and it was hard being your parents."" Essentially. It's...not wholly unfair. 

Wonder how much egg or chicken proceeded it. 


Teach the boy the ability to value. To come up with his own. Recognize his own. I don't know how much I can teach that, as I don't know enough of it myself, but that sounds like my having to teach myself emotional regulation. I still heavily struggle but I am **nothing** like what I was 5, six years ago on that front. 

He doesn't have enough experience having to feel those extremes to need to know how to regulate them... but does have some exposure to it, as he was there when I was trying to teach it to myself through dealing with situations with him. Victim, prototype, witness. 

Not entirely true. When I got him back....it was hell. I likened it to breaking a horse back then. 

The comparison he made last week... I'm glad to say that I am not like that anymore. But I do know what he's talking about. 

One of the many reasons I didn't think I should take him, one of the many reasons his father and I agreed that he should be with him. 

Necessity is mother of all invention. 

Those shifts of perspective....the accidental applying more value to what is outside of my control... mmmmmmmmm....no. different story. That was in my control. It is why it changed. Because I fucking tried. 

I vote. I try to talk to others with differing ideas in respectful ways if possible. I try to help where I can. 

Worth it to think about why? 

I mean... still here, ain't I? 

What was that, the whatsitcalledgoddamn Existentialism is a Humanism. 

Keep truckin'. Used to sing one of their songs to boyo when he was a baby. ""Lay down, my dear brother, lay down and take your rest..."" 

Pat his belly or back or cheeks or clap twice lightly after each ""bid you goodnight."" 

***

I don't think I'll every be intelligent enough to know as much as I'd like to at any given time. Asking for too much with that. Again. 

Same fucking lessons, over and over. Neh. Only kinda true. Similar variables, and life has got its limited range that scopes in and out with each frame of reference I apply at any given time. 

And we're all out of lemonade.

Would you want me to write to you here? 

My answers on that front, to myself, change by the day, by the hour. By the glance. 

Thank you for whatever it is you said the other day. I *think* you said ""me too,"" but I was too busy avoiding eye contact with you. It was not on purpose. I started bawling after I saw you, frankly. I don't know you at all, but it always feels like you completely understand the unspoken shit, and I don't know, I guess it felt... like the wound was finally getting to release all the blood that had been trying to spill. Ever cut yourself with an exacto-knife and you just *know* it's going to bleed like a bitch, but it's just... a stinging cut for now? Just waiting for it to pour.  

That silent undercurrent..  not much to study nowadays, but... you know, for a short while there it lightly disappated. I would have moments where I felt completely outside of it... but... it's stayed a silent undercurrent nonetheless, and has gotten back to strong over the last two weeks.  

You used to seem to intentionally walk into my line of eyesight as often as you could. 

You ever watched TNG? You know that really, REALLY stupid story arc between Data and Yar? 

I used to own a t-shirt that said ""Fully-functional and programmed in multiple techniques."" 
It was one of the first t-shirts I ever bought myself as an adult. 

Data and Deeana in the lifts, talking about friendship and his ""missing"" Yar. That's what I always equated your trying to enter my field of vision to. 

You know...maybe it wasn't that stupid. Did feel cheesy, but... it was something to explore. Interesting they pulled that experiment so quickly but... I mean... how long into starting the show was it until the writers strike? Almost said writer's block, badum. 

Babble-babble-fishpaste. 

I hope you didn't need my eye contact. I'm sorry if you did. There were a lot of emotions going on both times and... I kinda just wanted to both cry and hug you and... I mean... you know. 

Babble-babble-fishpaste. 

The great failed experiment... 

My step-dad, when I was turning 18, tried to suggest I stay celibate (Tesla and Newton used as examples, brain power and such) and join an artists commune. I was already well and lost as a person then, but I did see a good part of the value. It's been a life-long dream of mine to try my own. That was the one thing I took away from Zeitgeist, really. Earth-ships, hahahha. Other than that, I was actually pretty familiar with many of the concepts. It used to annoy me that I couldn't convince my ex that I was smarter than him. Such a jackass. Me. 

I wish I could tell the ""joke"" I've got about him right now, but... for some reason, though I'm fairly confident plenty of people know who I am, know about my account on here... sharing that feels like it might be giving too much away. Like *that's* going to be the one identifying thing... it doesn't feel ""safe"" to share. 

I don't feel like privacy is something to be had on the internet any more, but... that one feels like an FBI or CIA type of offense to share. Really weird. Guess that's just me being afraid of him...which is hilarious in many ways. 

...


Lots of mockingbirds outside right now. 

Not quite sure what *those* birds are...oddly plain looking. 

Get back to studying, me.

Hey! After spending four freezing winters wrapped in blankets and dreaming of sunshine, I finally said ""enough!"" and turned my travel obsession into a career. I worked as a tour guide in Turkey for 4 years, and I've discovered some amazing spots where you can escape the cold without breaking the bank.

Quick background: I'm that introverted girl who somehow ended up leading tours in Antalya (life's funny that way!). Now I want to share my favorite winter sun spots that I've actually experienced - no Pinterest fairy tales here!

My top picks (all tested personally):

🇹🇷 Antalya, Turkish Riviera

* Winter temps: 16-20°C (61-68°F)
* Budget: €50-80/day including hotel
* Pro tip: Stay in Kaleiçi (old town). I found this family-run hotel where the owner's cat became my alarm clock!
* Best for: Culture + beach combo

Fun story: I once tried ordering orange juice in Turkish and got a plate of oranges instead. The café owner found it so hilarious, he gave me both! That place became my winter hideout for years.

🇬🇷 Rhodes Old Town

* Winter temps: 15-18°C (59-64°F)
* Budget: €80-120/day
* Secret spot: There's this tiny bookshop selling English books hidden in the medieval streets
* Perfect for: History lovers who hate crowds

Real talk: Spent 3 hours in a local taverna during sudden rain and learned to make proper Greek coffee from the owner's grandmother. Best ""bad weather"" day ever!

🇮🇹 Sicily

* Winter temps: 14-18°C (57-64°F)
* Budget: €90-130/day
* Hidden gem: Local fruit markets where grandmas give you extra oranges if you attempt Italian
* Ideal for: Food lovers and photography enthusiasts

Money-saving hacks:

* Book Tuesday afternoons (weirdly works!)
* Winter packages often include airport transfers
* Local SIM cards > expensive roaming
* Free walking tours are gold

Edit: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for all the questions. Happy to share more details about specific places or safety tips for solo travelers!

Edit 2: For those asking about solo female safety - all these places have great public transport, well-lit streets, and active evening atmospheres. Plus, winter means fewer tourists but locals are extra friendly!",1,1731271414.0,u_Simplitty,0,1.0,False

I feel so disgusting that I can’t even enjoy sitting on the couch watching tv with her without it consuming my mind. I get so fucking horny and I can’t act on it at all and it drives me insane. I want her to want to touch me so badly i feel like a fucking creep. I feel so gross

The past couple days I’ve been thinking about a lot of the past sexual memories my wife (29F) and I (31M) have shared. I woke up yesterday morning from a dream of a sexual memory of her and I and it’s just been getting to me. The emotional roller coaster is crazy. I feel sad, frustrated, then sad again.

TMI incoming

I miss all the playful sexual things we used to do to each other (ALL THE TIME) and joke and laugh about it. I miss smacking her ass in the kitchen, humping her from behind when she bends over (and vice versa), poking her butt when she walks up the stairs in front of me. I miss when she used to just grab my junk randomly for a feel, when she used to bite her lip while doing it. Waking each other up and randomly fucking in the dead of the night or first thing in the morning. I miss undressing each other. I miss tickling her back and legs and feeling how wet she got when she opened them welcoming me to touch. I miss the random nudes she would send me for no reason. I miss when she used to ask me for them too cause she was thinking about me. The kinky texts. I have a screenshot of a text she sent me years ago that simply just says ‘wanna have sex tonight?’ followed by a nude and it turns me on so much. I miss having spontaneous sex in random places all over the house, on the coffee table, while cooking dinner, in the car fogging up the windows, out in public. I miss not needing to masturbate while she is in the house and just not needing to so often. I miss not feeling like a creep for peaking at her while she undresses after work. I miss admiring her body. I miss not feeling so disgusting for wanting sex so badly. I miss not feeling like I want sex so fucking badly all the time. I miss not feeling sad about it. I miss not getting my hopes up or thinking ‘maybe today’ and getting myself disappointed.

I remember one time she got out of the shower, freshly shaved, still wet, and just came up to me and sat on my face. Ugh it was so hot. I can literally still picture it. I LOVE eating her out. She used to give me head while I was playing video games or making dinner or when I walked in the door from work. She put her hand down my pants and gave me a handjob once while we were walking the dogs at night. I’ll never forget it. We fucked on a beach behind a railroad track on a fallen down tree once and it was amazing cause outdoor sex is one of my kinks. We fucked on my parent’s kitchen counter once and on her parent’s coffee table once lmao. We went to an art show and got there early and fucked in the car out front of the venue cause she wanted to before we went in. We went for a blunt ride late at night once and she gave me road head cause she couldn’t wait for me to pull over and bang it out. I miss all that kinky shit we used to do. Nothing is better than some good hot sex with your spouse. I miss how crazy it used to be sometimes. I miss how frequent and natural and easy it was to bond and connect like that. I miss her being the one to initiate a lot of those times too.
 
Sometimes I just really miss how sexual my wife used to be. I felt so wanted and desired by her, like I was the only man on earth. I crave her so badly. She’s so hot and has a great body and her love is intoxicating. She really is an amazing wife tho don’t get me wrong, I love her so dearly. Just sometimes I get a little sad thinking about how things used to be sexually between us. Maybe I’m a bit of a freak but I’m not a sex addict or anything. I just enjoy sex with my wife. Im a sexual guy. it’s part of who I am. I know we’ve grown up a bit and things have changed and that’s okay. I accept that and still give her all my love. She’s my best friend and I choose her for life for better or worse. If she wanted to be sexual with me like that again I’d be gladly accepting of it but I don’t expect it nor do I want her to change anything she doesn’t want to. I guess I just miss how SHE really used to want it for herself and how natural it came. I’ve heard sex in your 30’s is some of the best of your life and I can’t help feel like the highlight of my sex life has already came and went. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of all of this. 

Sorry to be graphic or if this isnt the place for a post like this. Sometimes I just get super horny and reminisce on the old times. I cant talk to my wife about it because I dont want her to feel sad so im posting it here for strangers on the internet lol

when i asked him what he wanted, he said he would like some after shave, and i was also thinking of bringing him flowers as well as his usual order on the house. he also has diabetes and said he cannot eat sugary foods, but that he would like a cake, so i dont really know how to approach that as i dont really know how diabetes work. he has a home nurse and is quite a shaky guy, but i cant think of any gifts that could assist him in that way, and idk if our budget would meet that either

he usually wears colorful clothes and he actually has the cutest raincoat outfit (bergen is VERY rainy) and he proudly showed me his super cool reversible beanie hat

i am quite the crafty person, and was thinking of maybe making him a little duck plushie on the side because he mentioned once that he liked donald duck hahaha

I showed up to the coffee shop a bit early, to be ready to meet him as soon as he walked in the door. I immediately ran up to greet him - we ended up going outside bc there were no seats inside. We made small talk about interview locations, the coffee shop itself, etc. I was mad stressed at first bc I forgot my credit card and I thought we'd be drinking something, but thankfully we were only inside for like 5 seconds. Now here's what he asked me:

**Why MIT?**

* I talked about what I looked for in a college (had this down to a tee) and then I talked about the MIT-specific opportunities and how they align with what I look for. A big part of what I talked about was research, which allowed a segue into the next question.

**You've talked a lot about future research, do you have past research experience you'd like to touch on?**

* My time to shine. I yapped about my research internships - this guy works at the lab I interned at, so while he didn't know anything about my team and projects specifically, he was familiar with the systems. His group actually had a member doing something very similar to what I did, so we yapped about research (his and mine) for a while.

**Any further questions for me?**

* He led with this a bit early, and I was kinda worried that the interview would end short, so I knew I had to yap. I asked what he remembered the most about his time at MIT (he graduated over 50 years ago).  He yapped A LOT here, and we had a nice conversation about values. Then he talked about the community aspect of MIT and how they look for people who can collaborate, and I was like, oh shoot, I haven't talked about collaboration yet at all. Luckily that was his next question.

**Have you worked with a team and collaborated with others?**

* I yapped about clubs and research, and eventually transitioned to teaching kids. Here we had a nice conversation since he used to teach youth athletics at my age (as do I now), so we both talked a lot about our experiences.

**Any further questions pt. 2**

* I asked were about whether he was involved in any student groups/clubs (which allowed us to talk about our interests). He also talked a lot about student life here.

**I know you're busy from the stuff you've told me; what else do you do for fun?**

* I yapped about jogging and chess. He's a swimmer and I'm a runner, so we talked about triathlons for a while bc we both know people who have done them. Got sidetracked a lot here.

**Further questions pt. 3**

* I asked him what advice he would give to himself when he was entering MIT (ie what would he change). At first he said he didn't have many regrets, but as we talked further he said he wished he took advantage of more opportunities MIT gave him, and also that he connected with his professors more and asked questions outside of class.

**Anything you'd like me to tell the AOs that they don't already know from your app?**

* I said no, I think the app did a great job of condensing who I am at my core. Then we yapped about the MIT app for a while, and different colleges and opportunities there. He said as long as you take advantage of all the opportunities you're given and put in a lot, you'll be fine no matter where you go to college. We talked a bit about our local college, which we've both done research at.

**Any questions about financial aid?**

* No. Pretty simple. We talked a bit more after this, but it was all superficial and it had been about an hour, so we parted ways.

All in all, it definitely felt more like a conversation than an interview - we just talked about our interests, and anytime there was a lull in the conversation, I kept coming back to ask him questions about his experience. Definitely wasn't an interrogation or anything like that - felt way more like 2 people having a pleasant back and forth. I think it went well - he told me he could definitely see me at MIT and that I was a good fit, but they get so many applications that 3/4 of the people who are good fits don't get in. He said the process felt like throwing darts at application files, which I thought was funny coming from an interviewer. I was also a bit surprised that he didn't ask me ""why major"" since I had a great answer prepared, but he just seemed to accept that I was interested in math (which I touched on in ""why MIT"") without asking why.

If I had any advice, 100% know a lot of stuff about the school. Envision yourself on campus - what classes you're excited for, what clubs you'd join, what labs you'd do research at, etc. Even if you only get to bring up 10% of it, better safe than sorry. I felt uber prepared, so I got to pick what I wanted to highlight. If your interviewer is older, use the opportunity to get wisdom - if they're younger, use it to understand the current student life. Treat it like a friendly conversation, don't be too nervous, speak slowly and clearly, and bring water.

Good luck to my fellow applicants!!",13,1731271142.0,ApplyingToCollege,4,1.0,False
1goa92v,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1goa92v/almost_daily_tension_headachebrain_fog/,Almost daily tension headache/brain fog,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old male, 174cm, 155lbs, about 12% bodyfat, and have been getting almost daily mild tension headaches for the past year or so and I've tried everything I can think of. Most of the pain is around the top of my neck (ESPECIALLY just below the skull on both sides on the back of the neck) with a little in my temples/jaw. It is so bad that barely any force on the area makes it feels extremely sore even when I don't have the headache. I can go about my day but it is very uncomfortable and gives me a lot of brain fog. This makes it hard to do my work and focus.

I sleep 7.5-8 hours everyday and I wake up everyday feeling fine but around noon or later in the afternoon I get a tension headache which lasts a couple of hours to half the day. I've tried everything I can think of and have a pretty healthy lifestyle. I lift for 1 hour 4x a week, do 20 mins of cardio 1-2x a week, and walk around 7-8k steps from university and life. My breakfast is pretty much always 1 egg, some fruit. and a cup of coffee. Lunch and dinner is whatever my mom cooks which is 95% of the time healthy, high protein, home cooked meals. I eat out 1-2x a week and will have something like a bowl of chips/ice cream every few days. Apart of those ""bad"" foods I take protein powder daily. I regularly hydrate enough where my urine is light yellow. I also do not smoke and drink like a beer every other week and drink heavy every few months with friends.

I'm pretty good at managing my time so university does not stress me out unless it is finals season or when I have lots of midterms in a short period of time. I do not have any medical conditions, anxiety, trauma or emotional issues. I have had my blood tested and everything came back healthy. I do not have any allergies. My sleep schedule is consistent. I think I sleep good since I don't have trouble falling asleep and don't wake up in the middle of the night often. My relationship with parents, friends and gf is good. Room is regularly cleaned with no mold. My contacts and glasses are up to prescription.

Things I have tried:

\- Cutting out gluten did not do anytthing

\- Reducing/increasing exercise from what I am doing not do anything

\- Eating 0 processed food including protein powder did not help

\- Have tried vitamin d, magnesium, and fish oil supplements which seemed to help a little bit.

\- Skipping breakfast and cutting out all caffeine did not help

Pour yogurt into cheese cloth/coffee filter/butter muslin, place that into a colander, and place that into a bowl

The reason I am curious is because I have a colander with pretty medium-sized holes that I'd like to use - and in my head I wouldn't expect that to make a difference if my understanding is correct (it just needs to have holes so the whey can pass through the cloth down to the bottom of the bowl).

\-------------

Context: As per Maryland state law, UMD is not required to recognize our union and collectively bargain with us. While grad workers have fought this battle in the MD state legislature yearly, UMD continues to spend money and time testifying to ensure the law remains unchanged. Luckily, the legislative route is not the only way to have UMD meet us at the bargaining table -- UMD can choose to voluntarily recognize our union, which would allow us to bypass the legislature entirely. Several universities voluntarily recognized their own grad workers' unions, including Georgetown, NYU, and University of Michigan. A supermajority of UMD grad workers have signed union authorization cards. It's time for UMD to recognize us and meet us at the bargaining table!

I can't find much info online about code related to the fridge outlet. I can tell they are 15A outlets and a 20A breaker. If I use anything on the outlets lately (like my coffee maker, or instantpot), the breaker trips and the fridge loses power until I flip the breaker back on.

1goa0jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1goa0jo/hpylorimy_treatment_and_progress/,H.pylori-My Treatment and progress ,"
I wanted to share my experience with H. pylori in case it helps others who might be going through something similar.

2022
After a routine physical, my health seemed fine, but I started experiencing bouts of intense nausea that lasted all night, along with heart palpitations going into 2023. I increased my magnesium intake, thinking it might help. As a vegetarian, I generally eat whole foods, with the occasional plant-based meat, pizza, or sweets, but I started noticing severe bloating, heartburn after pizza, and sensitivity to coffee and spices.

Early 2023
I chalked up my symptoms to getting older and assumed certain foods just didn’t agree with me anymore. Lower back pain also became common, but I thought it was from sitting at my desk all day.

January 2024
Determined to feel better, I started working out and focusing on my mental health. While I was seeing some progress mentally, I still had bloating and diarrhea issues.

September 2024
I was overdue for a physical, and my symptoms had intensified: heart palpitations, heartburn, acid reflux, and itchy rashes on my thighs. I’d been dealing with stress from losing multiple family members, so I assumed it was related to that. My blood work showed elevated white blood cells (Neutrophils), indicating an infection, but my doctor wasn’t concerned, even asking if it could be a UTI (which I didn’t have).

Within days, I experienced an intense, burning stomach pain that felt like severe acid reflux. My doctor suggested I try Prilosec, which helped initially, but my symptoms soon flared up again.

Challenges with Medical Support

Throughout this process, I often felt ignored by my primary care doctor, who seemed to brush off my symptoms. When I eventually saw a GI specialist, I felt the same—like they were quick to assume I’d need medication based on previous cases rather than fully investigating my situation. I’m cautious about medication, so I requested an endoscopy, but my GI doctor seemed reluctant, saying, “I’ll order it for your peace of mind.” It left me feeling unheard and neglected, which I can’t help but feel may be due to biases, whether as a woman, a woman of color, or just a result of an overloaded healthcare system.

H. pylori Treatment

Finally, after advocating for myself, and receiving an endoscopic procedure I did have a positive pylori diagnosis . I was prescribed a 14-day quad therapy (bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole, and a PPI). Managing the strict schedule was tough, and I dealt with nausea and bloating but mostly tolerated it well. I’m now on day 12 of the 14-day treatment and am hopeful for improvement. I’ll be retested in four weeks, and I hope my symptoms clear up for good and this is eradicated.


Mental Health Impact

The toughest part of this entire experience has been the toll it’s taken on my mental health. The constant stress and anxiety from dealing with these symptoms, along with the uncertainty, really brought me to an all-time low. It’s been exhausting and overwhelming, both physically and mentally, and I think it’s important to acknowledge just how deeply health issues like this can affect mental well-being.

Looking Ahead

I’ve stocked up on enzymes, a multivitamin, magnesium, and probiotics to support my recovery. My diet has been very restricted, and I plan to reintroduce foods slowly in the new year. I do feel some anxiety around eating now, as food has become a bit of a trigger for me.


Probiotics and Antibiotics

Throughout this treatment, I’ve been taking a probiotic first thing in the morning, which has been crucial in helping balance my gut health. I also made sure to include probiotic-rich foods in my diet throughout the day. It’s so important to avoid dairy and certain other foods that can interfere with antibiotic absorption. If anyone else is going through a similar treatment, I’d really recommend paying attention to probiotics and timing them to support your system.

A Note on Self-Advocacy

I’m sharing this not only to document my journey but to encourage others to advocate for themselves. If you feel unheard, remember—you know your body better than anyone. Don’t hesitate to push for tests or second opinions. Doctors are busy, but it’s important to ensure you’re receiving the care you deserve.

I hope this can offer some reassurance to others dealing with similar symptoms. I’ll keep everyone updated on my progress!

1goa04s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1goa04s/1800_karma/,1-800 Karma,"I think we all know what karma is. Occurrences that may or may not be pleasant to people who deserve it. 
 
 
I thought it was all just based on hopes and prayers. That is until I found it. A number or hotline as they call it. 1-800 Karma. Ok ok. Scratch that. They found me.
 
 
I was engaged in my daily routine of getting ready to leave for work when it happened. I got a notification that I had a new email in my inbox. So, since checking my emails was a part of my end of the day routine, I checked it. My boss had been giving me numerous assignments lately. So I guessed it was a new one to add to that.
 
 
When I checked however, it was from a sender I didn’t recognize. 1-800 Karma. No website. Just that 1-800 Karma.
 
 
I read the subject which said ‘Orientation’. “Great. Another training from my boss.” I sighed.
 
 
 I then began reading through the email to see what my boss wanted me to do.  “Welcome to 1-800 Karma Brandon! The place where you can get Karma to take revenge on anyone for you. Who would you like to get back first.” I read.
 
 
 “Ha ha, very funny Josh.” I laughed. 
 
 
My co-worker and best friend Josh and I always like to prank each other. So I knew this must’ve been from him. 
 
 
“George would be great.” I chuckled. 
 
 
George was my boss. As bosses normally do, he had given me a truck load of assignments for work. Since I worked in an office as a computer analyst, it mostly had to do with computer stuff. 
 
 
As I turned off my computer for the day, a cold chill ran up my spine. “We really need to fix that AC.”
 
 
When I got home that night, I was still thinking how strange the email and the sender name was. It looked like a phone number rather than an email name. Whatever Josh did, it was kind of cool how he was able to make the sender’s name like that. 
 
 
 
The rest of the night was normal. We had our regular family movie night. My wife Julie, the kids Anne, Krystal and I sat down to watch one of our favorite movies to watch together. Zootopia. A movie we watched almost every time it was Anne’s turn to choose the movie we watched.
 
 
In the part of the movie where Judy and Nick finally find the evil mastermind behind the things that happened in the movie, I remember hearing something odd. Judy the bunny Police Officer seemed to look at me “it’s done.” She said.
 
 
It was so odd because I’m all the 100 times I’ve seen this movie with my wife and kids, I never heard Judy say that in the movie before.
 
 
 As I was getting into bed, I thought about the part of the movie again. It sent a shiver up my spine because of how weird it was.
 
 
“Honey, it’s the start of summer.” Julie laughed getting into bed. “Why are you cold?”
 
 
“Don’t worry about it.” I told her before kissing her and heading off to Dreamland. 
 
 
I woke up to scream. It sounded like multiple people were either in excruciating pain or dying. I’d never heard anything like it. Well, maybe not never. I did hear it when Julie gave birth to our first girl Anne. 
 
 
I jumped up off the ground and stood. Why was I on the floor? I don’t know. But multiple screams made me worried about my wife. All the adrenaline of being worried made me brush off the fact that I was on the floor. 
 
 
I started running immediately to the screams as fast as I could so that I could get to where they were before anything could happen. These girls are my life. I wasn’t going to let anything happen to them. 
 
 
Then, a big fire appeared out of nowhere. Right in front of me. It actually looked like a demon. You know Jack Jack from the Incredibles when he becomes that fire? Imagine that, but the size of an adult. 
 
 
 
I didn’t care, I just ran as fast as I could toward it so I could get to my girls. Nothing, not even the biggest fire creature would stop me. 
 
 
“You’re next!” It shook me. “Wake up!”
 
 
“Baby!” I heard Julie scream.
 
 
I opened my eyes. It was morning and my wife was in front of me. 
 
 
“Some nightmare.” She chuckled. “You ok?”
 
 
“Yeah.” I nodded. 
 
 
Then, we went downstairs to start the day. Julie made us both coffees and I turned CNN. It was part of our normal morning routine. 
 
 
There was a young woman with a microphone in her hand. She was standing in front of chard remains of something I couldn’t see well and yellow police tape. 
 
 
“I’m Kelsey Robertson reporting from the scene of a massive fire at the Braxton condominium.” She began.
 
 
“Isn’t that where your boss and Josh live?” Julie asked from the kitchen.
 
 
“Yeah.” I nodded. “But they’re tough. They got out.”
 
 
I changed the channel to a more pleasant show. SpongeBob. I needed that more than I needed the news. 
 
 
Then I thought of the email I got from 1-800 karma. 
 
 
“No. This can’t be.” I thought. 
 
 
I shook my head.
 
 
“They’re fine.” I reassured myself. “That was just junk mail.”
 
 
The rest of the day went on pretty normal. Well, as normal as it could be at least. Complete with a family drive, games when we got back since it was raining and Red Lobster for dinner. 
Throughout the day, I couldn’t get the news out of my head. Why was it there? Why did it happen?
 
 
It was a lot harder to reassure myself because it kept making shivers run up my spine. 
While we were playing UNO in the evening, my cell phone began to ring. It wasn’t late so I wasn’t shocked or worried about it. 
 
 
“Can you take my turn?” I told Julie before getting up. 
 
 
I walked out of the room. 
 
 
“Sam.” I began. 
 
 
“Hi Sam.” My boss’ assistant Sally replied. “Just calling to let you know I moved up to be your boss. And that you’ll be moving to Josh’s former position.”
 
 
A cold chill ran up my spine.
 
 
No. They had to have moved. Crazy as it seems since no one talked about anything. I would’ve heard something from Josh especially since he was in the cubical next to mine. 
 
 
“What happened?” I asked. “They move or something?”
 
 
“No, it’s actually worse than that.” She hesitated. “They died last night in the Braxton as you probably saw on the news.”
 
 
I knew it. I knew something was up with that email.
 
 
But why did Josh die?

1go9vke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1go9vke/aita_for_being_the_cause_of_my_father_and/,AITA for being the cause of my father and step-moms arguments,"for starters since this might get confusing, my dad bought me here to a new country and have told me before to start changing my habits and to get along with the people in the house since hes the one paying the bills. he never really taught me anything on how the house works and what to do after bringing me here. my step mom, lets call her elle, has tried conversing and trying to get along with me the first 2-ish months of me moving but after an argument with my dad she became hostile to me (told my family in my home country some of my experiences with my family and called me names..) she never tried to converse with me anymore after that and also accused me of a lot of things after that fight.

so i (17F) really tried adjusting to my new life, but after my dad and elle always fighting, ive been in a depressive state and all my attempts of changing my ways have been useless. i went back to being this anti-social and depressed teen. i dont talk to anyone and i always minded my business, only leaving my room if necessary. i tried my best not to be in anyones way and avoided interacting with anyone since i was in a bad mental state. apparently that was the worst thing to do in my situation according to elle. 

elle was doing something in the kitchen, i was gonna make my coffee but since i saw her looking busy i backtracked and went back to my room. then later that night my dad and elle were fighting and the argument shifted to me 'ignoring' elle since she told my dad how she wanted to be atleast acknowledged by me. my dad talked to me about it and how i should greet her whenever i went out my room but even after all that i couldnt bring myself to even say hi to her. 

i do greet the others whenever they say hi to me. just a simple nod though since i tend to go mute when im at home. i cant do this greeting i usually do to everyone for elle since shes either looking at her phone or occupied with my baby brother. 

there are more arguments where they always mention me one way or another and my dad always told me how he would be defending me from elle.

there was also this one argument where i (regretfully so) meddled in. this was also the last time elle wanted me to interact with her kids. (they were the ones who would take me exploring the country and after that argument they never took me again.) she told her youngest, who ill call reese (10), to never interact with me since i was a bad influence and how she should interact with kids her age. 

fast forward to now, i asked reese why she was told to never speak to me and she told me that elle said i start arguments. i really pondered why elle came to that conclusion.

all i can come up are these (mentioned by my dad since elle doesnt want to talk to me about it directly):

•forgot to close the door to the patio
•never asked elle on what chores i can do (she told me before that they dont do chores much since there werent many things to clean — this house is actually way messier than the house in my home country and my room was always told to be messy too..)
•lied about my dad buying me an apple pencil (i wish i did lie about it😞)
•was given money to buy something from jb-fi(?)
•wanted me to treat them like family and not be individualistic (idk if my translation for 'mapag-isa' is right)
•treated my younger brother wrong (i apparently ignore him.. i do actually ignore him if i was busy doing something but i would quietly interact with him though..)
•dont actually have depression but just lazy (im not professionally diagnosed since we cant afford it but i tried to summarize it for her when we were talking lmaoo)  
•had a problem with me eating in my room since she heard clinking from my room. (never ate that day and only drank coffee. she heard me stirring my coffee not eating.)

majority of these were from my dads screenshot of their chats. i cant really list everything though since i forgot and some are private for reasons.

i told my dad before that i can just go back to my home country since i already had my backup plan if i were sent back. he just told me ""then what about all the work i did to make you stay here. all of that would have gone to waste if you decided to stay there."" to be fair, when i just got here, my dad would go to my room after their arguments and tell me ""this is what i deal with on a day to day basis. do you want me to suffer like this? if you dont want me to then lets book a flight home."" guess the tables have been turned.

last month i talked to her kids about my problems and all they said was just communicate with her. now heres two ways on how that would look like: 

a.) i tell her my problems and try to be civil with her. she'd go to my dad and tell him what i told her and twist my words to fit her narrative and fight over it. 

b.) we get along and be civil but she'd still use my words against me if she fights with my dad. 

c.) everything is gonna go well. (i actually doubt it.)

i really need advice on what i should do (i wanna try talking but im afraid ill cause another fight). ive been contemplating this ever since i talked with elles kids. this is so long omgggg💀

edit: i also wanna add that elle would threaten my dad with my visa. how? i also forgot lmaooooo

1go9ut9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1go9ut9,Zine self-review -- Straightaway Tangent #1 and 2 -- vanlife/road trip perzines,"After becoming increasingly obsessive over zines and zine culture over the course of several years, and after a few abortive attempts at writing my own, last spring I finished writing and released my first two zines, called *Straightaway Tangent*.

These are text-heavy diary-style perzines documenting a three-week solo van trip I took about two years ago, in the fall of 2022, from Pennsylvania to Savannah, Georgia, and different places in Florida. They’re about urban stealth camping in a vehicle, the experience of traveling on American roads and the wild stuff you see when you sleep in Walmart parking lots. They’re also a crush story – as I described to that person, “Everything I did for three weeks while I was waiting for you to text me back.” 

Or, as I describe in the zine:  “Straightaway Tangent is about travel, coffee shops, roads, urbanism, waking up in a van, working through an unrequited crush, goth shit, escaping winter, hot water, video games, zines, Krishna consciousness and other spiritual paths, and social anxiety.”

For fans of perzines, travel, vanlife, and zines like *Cometbus*, *Doris*, *Dishwasher*, and *Dream Whip*.

It’s half-size, 52 pages with color photos, and cardstock covers from French Paper.

Copies are available from [Behind the Zines Distro](https://behind-the-zines.com/zines-n-z) (email Billy) or [The Word Distribution](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheWordDistribution?ref=hdr_shop_menu) or message me directly.

1go9t3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/enviromentalists/comments/1go9t3g/what_can_we_replace_plastic_straws_with/,What Can We Replace Plastic Straws With.,"I don't have to tell you why plastic straws are bad for the environment. If you are on this subreddit, you already know. You are most likely part of the campaign to get plastic straws banned. I'm with you, but if we want that campaign to go anywhere, we must answer one simple question: What will we replace Plastic Straws with?

The most popular answer was Paper Straws. People ended up hating Paper Straws; they were too perishable and often degraded mid-drink, and people made angry tweets about them.

In my opinion, the issue lies in the way we approach the issue. Instead of asking how we build better single-use straws, we should be asking why we're using single-use straws in the first place. People with full mobility don't need straws to drink soda-pop. So why does every drive-through in America dole them out with every meal?  
Because bringing an uncovered beverage into a moving car would invite disaster, so they give you a lid and a straw to minimize spillage. You don't need straws to do that. We could redesign the soda lids to function perfectly fine without the use of a straw. In much the same way that coffee lids work without straws, the same could be done with soda.

We are all currently sophomores. 2 of my roommates just moved out. For clarification my college campus requires all students to live on campus for all 4 years, we are currently in the sophomore dorms where it’s 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and living room. It’s 2 girls to a room. For the sake of this story we will call my roommate Q and the other 2 M and K. Q and K just moved out. All 4 of us are really close, or so I thought. Q and I were suite mates our freshman year, we became really close and did almost everything together. Early on our freshman year she had noticed I was struggling making friends and asked one night if I wanted to hang out with her friends(where I met K and M), after that night I have been apart of her friend group, now mine as well. Me, Q,K, and M very early in to our freshman year realized we wanted to live together the rest of college and planned to live together sophomore year. Q and K met prior to starting college at a coffee shop and were the closest of us 4. It’s only been 4 months into sophomore year and they just moved out. They gave us a 1 day notice and M and I were shocked we had no idea why. They moved out and that was that. About a week after Q and K moved out I reached out to Q to ask why. She told me that K had gotten really sick and tired of living with M and she with me, that I wouldn’t let her boyfriend sleep over. She told me that me and M had come off for the past month as really controlling, that they didn’t like that during the week we had a kick out time for boyfriends at 12:30am and that we made it seem that friends weren’t allowed over and that they said it made it seem like M and I had mandatory quite hours in the apartment. For clarification Q and Ks boyfriends would be out in the living room on a Wednesday screaming or yelling at each other until 4am goofing off while M and I were trying to sleep. Me and M had asked very nicely if we could have a curfew for boyfriends ours including. We had no problem other wiser. For me not liking Qs boyfriend sleeping over during the week was due the that during freshman year my roommate had her boyfriend spend the night every night including having sex while I was in the room across from me, when I learned this I kicked her boyfriend out and neither of them were ever in the room again. I had told Q very early on that I didn’t want to deal with that again or experience that again and she understood. Apparently she didn’t like that and just didn’t talk to me about it. Me and M didn’t have a problem with friends at all so I don’t know where they got the idea that friends weren’t allowed over. I will say that Q did have one friend who didn’t like me one bit and to give them space I would go to my boyfriend’s room to hang out with him instead to give them space. For M and Ks problems, K moved out because she didn’t like that M would clean there room.

1go9qx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1go9qx1/raised_by_unspeakables/,Raised by Unspeakables,"Unspeakable Croaker sits down at his kitchen table after checking his wards to make sure nothing has been tampered with, his usual morning ritual. A house elf appears with a pop. ""Your coffee, and your newspaper, sir!"" Croaker smiles at the handy overlooked creature who has helped him more times than he can count. ""Ah, thank you, Bopsy."" Croaker looks at the newspaper after taking a sip of his coffee, and is suprised. 
Croaker knew the dark lord Voldemort has been defeated a few days ago, but he couldn't figure out much from investigating the site exept hints of a ritual being used by Lilly Potter, which was instrumental for the defeat. But now... 
The interview with Albus Dumbledore describes the scar on young Potter's forehead, and Croaker feels something is off. Something is not right. He gets up, he needs to investigate this, he needs to find Harry Potter, the signs of the ritual, they could have a side effect... Oh, he hopes, he hopes, but he has to know for sure.

Croaker walks into a citizen registration office and with a few... Persuasions, he looks for the name Evans in the books. So many Evanses. He already figured out that little Potter is most likely placed with Lilly Potter's muggle family, but how to find them. Wait. “Bopsy?” Once the elf appears, Croaker asks for a very specific newspaper from 1979. He grabs the newspaper which reported on the Potter wedding and scans through it. There, Petunia Evans. Petunia. Croaker scans through the document again and finds her. Petunia Dursley, nee Evans. Privet Drive 4. Finally.

As Croaker approaches the house, he can't help but be fascinated by how much everything is in a forced perfect state. Ah, the wonders of peer pressure and wanting to seem normal. Boring. He walks towards the house and rings the doorbell. He doesn't hear anyone approaching, maybe there isn't anyone home. 
Sighing, Croaker holds his ear against the door, to make sure there's really no one home, when he hears a distant whimper. Something feels off. ""Alohomora."" After that whisper, he quietly walks in and tries to find the source of the whimper, even though it's probably not completely ethical. No matter. Croaker frowns and slowly turns towards the cupboard. It's locked, but it for sure isn't empty.

Croaker breathes in and out deeply so as to not go up the stairs and kill those animals when there's a child, a one year old child, looking at him from a damn cupboard. Oh, he will murder them, but first… Croaker carefully picks up the child with the big green eyes and sighs. He can't leave the child behind and he doesn't trust anyone to do what is right. Damn it. He isn't equipped for this. Damn it. Croaker knows he can't do this, he's married to his job, but he can't get himself to be heartless this time.

Nobody has to know how he walks out of the house with a child wrapped in his cloak. He will swear his department to secrecy and make sure that young Harry will grow up outside of a cupboard and be trained, and for that scar to be looked at. But most importantly, he will be damned sure Harry will be loved, and that someone will have an unfortunate accident for putting a baby in a cupboard.

I think the only reason we didn't mess up on special teams is that we didn't allow Ole Miss's punter on the field, letting them get field goals every possession instead. A real 4D chess move if I ever saw one.

So I've been really thinking about how yesterday could have come to pass. I believe I have found the problem. Luckily this can be easily fixed this week in preparation for Tenn.

1. Throughout this entire season there has been a single observable consistency between our two losses from the vantage point of my household.

I have only used my Georgia coffee mug on game day on two occasions. What were those two days? You've probably figured it out by now - Bama and Ole Miss.

No problem. This is an easy area for us to address in the off-week and during game day adjustments. This will NOT affect us at Tennessee.

2. On the Texas game day I wore a new long sleeve UGA shirt to work out in but then switched to a different UGA shirt for the game. This made me cocky and I let that cockiness get to my head and it affected my game day preparation.

On Ole Miss day I skipped the gym and wore that same long sleeve shirt all day long.

We all saw the result.

I won't to offer my sincerest apologies to all of Dawg Nation (you, the fans, not that garbage web site), the esteemed University of Georgia athletic program, and most importantly to our Coach and Savior, Kirby Smart.

Melody won the basket nearly as often. An analytical thinker, she kept samples of our handwriting, and she usually spent quite a bit of time analyzing the slips of paper to try to ascertain who wrote which secret.

Then there was Zuri, who always made sure the basket had a bottle of (very) expensive wine. She didn’t even drink herself, but she liked the rest of us to have a good time. She was a terrible guesser.

Kim was our resident joker, always donating something silly to the basket, like “the world’s spiciest chip” or a giant gummi bear. He won the basket only once before.

Steve was the blandest guy imaginable, and usually donated something boring—bath products or pistachios or coffee. He never really got our in-jokes or quite fit in with the group.

Our tradition’s been going on strong ten years now. We’ve always had a good time. And that’s why what happened makes no sense at all.

My wife dropped me off at the cabin on a Friday evening. Kim, Steve, Dan, and Melody arrived, each putting slips in the hat. Zuri couldn’t make it this year but wine came with a note for us to enjoy ourselves.

After dinner, we pulled the slips out of the hat. Five slips of paper with our five secrets that read:

*I have a secret crush on someone.*

*I spent fifty-two cents on the prize I bought for the basket. :)*

*I have a star named after me.*

*It’s a girl!*

*I’m going to murder one of you.*

We read them all aloud, laughing and shouting guesses until we got to the last one. Everyone went quiet. Someone wondered if it was a joke—we all looked at resident joker Kim, but he said his was the fifty-two cents one. Everyone began snatching their slips, until each of us was holding a slip except me.

“It’s Mia!” They all said. “Mia’s planning a murder!”

“No I’m not!” I sputtered. “I wrote ‘I started a new diet’!”

Who had swapped my secret for the murder one?

To say that tensions were high would be an understatement. In the end, Dan suggested we skip the game and share the basket. But everyone’s mood was sour except for Kim, who happily ate all the chocolates and drank half the wine bottle himself. I wondered if he really *did* put that murder slip in there as a prank, just so we’d wind up splitting the basket and he’d get a share.

But the next morning, we woke up and found Kim lying blue-faced and wide-eyed in the bed, vomit staining the pillow and sheets beside him.

And suddenly we were all screaming, panicking, wondering which of us had done it. We hurled accusations while waiting for police.

“The wine,” said Dan. “He was obviously poisoned. It must’ve been the wine!”

“Maybe it was the chocolates,” said Melody.

“But they weren’t even out of the plastic wrapping!” I said.

“It was the wine,” Dan insisted. “Think about it. One of us wrote that incriminating secret, right? But Zuri’s got an alibi because she’s not here. The police look for someone involved in the game. And she gets away with murder in the perfect crime.”

“Okay, but how does she get the slip of paper into the hat if she was never here?” said Melody.

We reviewed the secrets again. Steve had a secret crush, Dan’s wife was having a little girl, Melody had a star named after her (“You know those are scams, right?” I told her). Mine was still missing.

That’s how all suspicion suddenly turned on me. When police arrived, everyone was interviewed. I was the prime suspect, even after I told police someone swapped out my secret slip about a new diet before we drew them from the hat. I even searched the trash cans and recycling but couldn’t find mine to prove my innocence. The remaining papers were turned over to check for fingerprints. The authorities took the wine bottle and what was left of the chocolate box too.

My friends all thought I was a killer. I *knew* one of them was.

Later that evening, when I was finally back home and still wondering who had lied, the dog was whining to go out, so I grabbed a coat and took him out. And suddenly everything clicked horrifyingly into place. We had *all* been right. Dan was right about the perfect alibi. Melody was right about the chocolates—not the ones in plastic wrap in the basket, but the ones in my bag that were supposed to be *mine,* that Kim stole like he did every year. And *I* had been right that my slip of paper had been switched.

Fear coursed through me as I pulled a crumpled slip of paper from the pocket: *I started a new diet*

Hey everyone, happy sunday :) How are you all doing? well I hope. Anyone want to chat while I write my essay? Or to share redecorating tips?

Some stuff about me, I'm a huge reader and I'm always looking to expand my library with suggestions, so give me what you've got.

I love to bake (my scones are second to none and I will fight anyone on that) and I'm a big big fan of life hacks, please do share any with me if you have them?

Every time I come to work I can’t help it but feel dejected and sometimes downright sad. 

The job itself is fine, the pay is not bad either and my boss is great. Even my coworkers are okay for the most part, as everyone does their job and there’s rarely a bad atmosphere or arguments during the day. 

However, I really miss the feeling of coming to work and  looking forward to talking with someone I can connect with, I can share a laugh with or even talk about heavier stuff. 

There used to be a coworker like that, actually one of the first peopIe met when I started working at the place. As we started to work together a lot we spent a lot of time talking and getting to know each other. We’d buy each other coffee, share a snack and just generally hang out when there wasn’t much work to do. We’d start our shift by asking each other how our day was and laughing or supporting each other if one of us had a shitty day. I was genuinely interested in her life and I felt like she was in mine and I’d look forward to coming to work just to see and talk with her. 

Lastly, she was a great coworker and I genuinely enjoyed working with her on professional level as she taught me many things about the job and would always do the 100% needed, motivating me as well

However, she quit the job a while ago and although the circumstances of us parting ways weren’t the best I still miss working with her and just generally meeting her at the workplace. 

Since she left I haven’t managed to find a person like her and most of the time I don’t talk to other coworkers aside from work related stuff. I can’t remember the time when I asked someone about their day or being asked about how I’m doing. 

So now every time I’m at work I can’t help myself but think about the good times with the above mentioned coworker, remembering all the good moments and being dejected about how the situation changed. 

If anyone read up to this point thank you, and I’d appreciate any helpful advice or comment",2,1731269494.0,SeriousConversation,1,1.0,False
