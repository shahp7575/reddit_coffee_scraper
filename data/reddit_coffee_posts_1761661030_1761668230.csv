1oidqip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oidqip,F1 tastes bland after 12 days? More info below,"Does F1 go through a ""bland period"" between the sweet start and tangy finish or is my brew dead? I tasted it after 12 days and it just tasted like watery tea with maybe a teeny tiny bit of sweetness. No fizz. pH is 3.0. I don't see any mold but there is that filmy looking stuff floating on top. I think the pellicle sunk and turned sideways because I dipped my tasting cup in there. 

My recipe:
- Bring 15-16 cups of water to boil. Let it roll for 10 minutes to boil off chemicals.
- Turn off heat. Add 8 English Breakfast tea bags. Steep 15 minutes. (I may have messed up the time and did 20 this time by mistake)
- Remove tea bags. Add 1.5 cups sugar. (I know the standard recipe is 1 cup, but I prefer the flavor of 1.5). Let cool.
- Add to 2 cups of previous brew.
- Cover with coffee filter.",1,1761668173.0,Kombucha,1,1.0,False

We keep a clean, quiet space, we're very friendly, we cook a lot, and socialize occasionally but generally are very busy with work. Looking for somebody on the same wavelength!

There is no credit check but I would ask for proof of income / copy of ID, and write a simple agreement giving each other at least 30 days notice to move out. Definitely looking for the right long-term fit!

Here’s the thing about the[ iPhone 17](https://www.apple.com/ca/iphone-17/): it looks boring on paper. I get it. But after using it for two weeks? This might be the first “regular” iPhone I’d actually tell most people to buy. Let me be honest with you guys. I’ve been testing both this and the flashy new iPhone Air. And while the Air gets all the attention at coffee shops, it’s the[ iPhone](https://bitbyteiq.com/mtq7)[ 17](https://bitbyteiq.com/mtq7) that quietly became my daily driver. It just gets the job done without any drama. The reality is that Apple has finally stopped holding back key features from its base model. We’re talking a proper 120Hz display, legit camera upgrades, iPhone 1and battery life that actually lasts all day. All for the same $799 price. So yeah, the [iPhone 17 Pro](https://bitbyteiq.com/jmv2) might have the fancy titanium. The Air might be ridiculously thin. But this?

Lately, I’ve been commuting to work by bus and then by tram. On the bus, I met this really pretty girl, and I liked her right away. I hesitated for a long time before I finally worked up the courage to talk to her. Eventually, I tried to flirt a little. We started chatting about our daily commutes—it was nice—but then she started avoiding me.

Over the next few weeks, I thought she wasn’t interested, but one day, out of nowhere, she sat next to me without saying a word. Since then, she’d sneak glances at me and then act like I didn’t matter. I think she might have a Fearful-Avoidant attachment style—or Disorganized attachment she clearly seems afraid of closeness.

I invited her for coffee, and she said she wasn’t sure and needed time to think about it. She even lied about her name, even though I know her real name because she told me during our first conversation. She asked if I really needed an answer immediately. After that, she started avoiding me again. When I get closer, she backs off; when I give her space, she seems to come closer. I can see in her eyes that she’s really interested, but the moment I approach, she either turns away or pulls out her phone, pretending not to notice me.

When we noticed, we wiped it dry and two fairly crisp, dark rings remained. Following some recommendations from google, we tried baking soda, which turns the rings white, then feed and wax, then a hair dryer, then baking soda again, and then mineral oil. None of these really helped, and the rings got worse, and more diffused in shape. The picture is the current state.

A while ago I built **Money+**, a simple expense tracker that actually worked great - but over time I wanted something faster, smoother, and easier to use, while keeping all the features I rely on every day.

So I decided to start over and create [**Moneyra**](https://www.moneyra.app) \- a personal finance app that works **completely offline**, with:

* **Instant local storage**
* **Automatic iCloud backups**
* **Clean, minimal design**
* **Smooth, native-feeling animations**

There are many expense apps out there (including free ones), but I wanted to create one that feels native, fast, and thoughtfully designed - not overloaded with features.  
Moneyra includes a generous free plan, and most of what you need to track spending is already there.

I decided to treat it like a mini study, becuase my gut was already screaming this will not be cheaper or faster. I logged door to door time, costs, focus time, even the number of random desk drive bys that turn into ten minute chats about nothing. Commute is 62 minutes each way on NJ Transit, plus a 12 minute walk that is cute on sunny days and terrible in rain. The monthly train pass is 198, parking near the station is 36, lunches are about 14 to 17 per day if I dont bring food, and I realized I tip more when I am tired. Gas is small for me at 22, but daycare extension for pickup jumped by 60 per week because I arrive later. The first week back I also bought cold meds for 11 after a coworker came in sick. Four weeks total cost looks like 198 plus 36 plus 22 plus 60 times four plus around 150 for food, so rough 756 give or take, and that is before wear on my old Civic and the random coffee stops that I pretend are networking.

On output I measured deep work with a Focus To Do timer and a dumb spreadsheet. At home I average 4 hours 20 minutes of real focus, code and design, not meetings. In office days the average dropped to 2 hours 35 minutes. Teams meetings did not disapear, they just moved to small rooms that are always booked, so I end up on calls from my desk with noise, then I get asked why I have headphones on. The first day back looked quiet, second day everyone had thier heads down, by week three we were doing, no joke, more meetings becuase people felt they needed to justify being seen. I also noticed I am more reactive in office, I jump to Slack pings faster, my own fault, and context switching eats me alive. I like my coworkers, I really do, I also like not losing 10 hours a week to transit and hallway hellos that secretly take 14 minutes.



Health and energy wise it is not great. I run before work on home days, shower, coffee, sit down at 8, and by noon I am done with the hard parts. Office days I get up at 5 50 to catch the 6 40 train, my sleep is choppy, I snack more, I skip the run because time is tight. By Friday I am a potato. My spouse says I am more irritable on office weeks, I say they are right. The one clear win is a whiteboard session we did for 45 minutes that really did unlock a tricky API boundary, so I am not pretending office has zero value. It is just very spiky, one good moment and a lot of waiting for rooms or syncing calendars.

I wrote this up for my manager with the numbers and a simple ask, can we try a six week pilot with one office day and two optional cowork days, with the team picking a single overlap day for the whiteboard bits. I am mid level IC in product eng, not a people manager, so I want to keep it calm and data first. For folks here who pushed back on RTO without blowing up your relationship with your boss, what worked in your pitch. Did you share cost math, the focus time chart, or frame it around delivery metrics like cycle time and on call tickets. If they want us in office for culture, what rituals actually helped you build it without burning hours on trains and highways.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My roommate (27F)  is extremely dirty. I’ve put up with it because overall it’s a good living situation and she’s a really good person, we do get along well. Today her room was dirty to the point of used condoms on the floor, dirty underwear with dirty pads all over the floor, old coffee cups and food with a bug/gnat infestation situation and she left multiple dishes full of yogurt in her room for so long that there’s mold all over them and I had to toss them. She also always leaves the toilet full of shit stains.

I know she’s stressed so I do try to give a lot of grace and ask very nicely if she can please put the dishes in the sink and I’ll take care of it. I’ve even washed her sheets and put them back on the bed because it was starting to smell so badly.

I’m a practitioner of **Traditional Chinese Medicine** who geeks out on herbs, tea, and the quiet power of daily habits. My favorite topic lately? The humble yet mighty [**Shilajit**](https://boscent.com/products/shilajit). If wellness had a utility belt, Shilajit would be the multi-tool.

What TCM is—in plain words

**Traditional Chinese Medicine** looks at the whole person. We observe patterns, balance systems, and support your body so it can do what it already knows best: stay well. It’s about **preventing disease** by keeping your energy (Qi) smooth, your digestion calm, and your sleep steady.

What’s an adaptogen?

An **adaptogen** is a plant or natural substance that helps your body adapt to stress. In TCM terms, think “tonifying without overstimulating.” You get steady fuel, not a jittery spike. Great for **preventing disease**, supporting resilience, and keeping your inner batteries charged.

Meet Shilajit

**Shilajit** is a mineral-rich resin that forms in high mountain rocks. In my clinic, I think of it as a deep-reserve tonic and a classic **adaptogen**. It’s packed with trace minerals and fulvic compounds that support cellular energy. Translation: it helps your body use fuel more efficiently, so you feel a cleaner kind of oomph.

Ever drunk three coffees and felt like a hummingbird with taxes due? **Shilajit** aims for the opposite—calm energy, not chaos.

How I use it in TCM practice

In **Traditional Chinese Medicine**, I pair **Shilajit** with formulas that support the Spleen and Kidney systems—the foundations of stamina and recovery. A tiny pea-sized amount, once or twice daily, mixed in warm water or tea, can be enough. It fits beautifully into a prevention routine focused on **preventing disease**, steady energy, and long-term balance.

What does research say? (No jargon, promise)

Early studies suggest that **Shilajit** may support mitochondrial function—the tiny power plants inside your cells. It also appears to help with mineral absorption and healthy inflammatory balance. That’s science-speak for “more efficient energy, better recovery,” which aligns with how an **adaptogen** should behave. We still need more large, high-quality trials, but the trend is encouraging and very consistent with TCM’s prevention mindset.

Why it matters for prevention

Daily life is a stress obstacle course. **Shilajit** gives gentle, steady support, which is exactly the kind of help **Traditional Chinese Medicine** uses for **preventing disease**. When your energy is smooth and your systems are balanced, you bounce back faster. Isn’t that what we all want?

Practical tips

* Start small. A tiny dose of **Shilajit** goes a long way.  
* Be consistent. Like any solid **adaptogen**, it shines with daily use.  
* Pair it smartly. Combine with a TCM-guided routine—good sleep, warm meals, gentle movement—for powerful **preventing disease** benefits.  
* Quality matters. Choose tested sources of **Shilajit** to ensure purity and potency.  

One more thought

Could a simple daily ritual really make you feel more balanced and energized? In my experience, yes—especially when that ritual includes [**Shilajit**](https://boscent.com/products/shilajit), a thoughtful **adaptogen**, and the prevention-first lens of **Traditional Chinese Medicine**.

I work full time, currently at a new job as an AM at a cute clothing store. Outside of work I enjoy taking long hikes with my puppy, (his name is beans: you will def get puppy pics) playing video games (mostly WoW on a private server, and retail. outside of pc i play a few cozy games like animal crossing, fantasy life and pokémon on switch), reading horror & romance books, studying for my comptia, watching anime & going to coffee shops. I guess you could say i’m a typical PNW person lol. I spend a lot of time at my desk either studying or playing wow. 

I am looking for all walks of life, let’s chat and see if we connect? I’m not looking for anything romantic, just friends because I am a bit lonely & introverted. Looking for people 28-38 in age!

1oidayr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oidayr/i_got_a_job_at_a_local_sustainable_restaurant_i/,I got a job at a local sustainable restaurant. I wish I'd stayed unemployed. part 1,"I need to write this down before I lose my nerve. Before I convince myself it's fine. Before I go back in for my next shift.

Three months ago, I was two weeks away from eviction. My savings were gone, my resume was getting auto-rejected by every corporate chain in a fifty-mile radius, and I'd started mentally budgeting which meals I could skip. So when I saw the posting for Harvest Table. 

""Local. Ethical. Nourishing.""  

Offering $18/hour plus benefits and free staff meals, I applied before I'd finished reading the description.

The interview was in the kitchen. That should've been my first clue.

Maria, the owner, was waiting for me at the prep station. She's a big woman, the kind of big that takes up space apologetically, shoulders always hunched like she's trying to fold herself smaller. But her hands were busy,  elbow-deep in a stainless steel bowl of ground meat, kneading it with her bare fingers while she talked.

""You ever work food service?"" she asked, not looking up. A strand of gray hair had come loose from her bun and hung over her face. She didn't brush it away.

""Yes ma'am. Two years at a diner, six months at—""

""Good. You start Monday. Six a.m."" She finally looked at me, fingers still working the meat. There was something dark under her fingernails. ""We serve breakfast and lunch. Dinner prep only. Everything here is *local*. You understand? No factory farms. No chemicals. We know where every ingredient comes from.""

She said it like a point of pride. Like it mattered.

I nodded. I would've agreed to anything.

""My daughter handles front-of-house,"" Maria continued, wiping her hands on her apron, not washing them, just wiping. ""You'll meet her Monday. She's the face of this place. The *heart*."" She smiled, and a bit of meat was stuck between her front teeth. ""I'm just the one who makes it all work.""

I thanked her. Shook her hand. It was still damp and cold from the meat.

Her daughter's name is Lily.

I met her my first day, and I swear to god, I forgot how to act normal for a solid ten seconds.

She's the kind of pretty that doesn't need effort, dark hair pulled into a messy bun, freckles across her nose, wearing a Harvest Table t-shirt that somehow looked intentional instead of corporate. She smiled when she saw me fumbling with my apron strings and came over to help.

""You must be the new guy. I'm Lily."" Her hands were warm. She smelled like coffee and lavender. ""Mom's probably already scared you, right? Don't worry. She's intense, but she really believes in what we're doing here.""

""Yeah, she seems... passionate.""

Lily laughed. ""That's a polite way to put it. But seriously, this place? It's not just a job. We're actually *doing* something. No exploited workers, no animal cruelty, no fake 'organic' labels. Every supplier we use, I've visited personally. I've shaken their hands. I *know* them.""

She said it like a confession. Like she was letting me in on something sacred.

I wanted to believe her. I think I needed to.

The first week was fine. Great, even.

The kitchen was clean enough, or at least it looked clean under the fluorescent lights. We prepped vegetables in the morning, assembled salads and grain bowls for the lunch rush, baked bread from scratch. The menu was small but thoughtful: roasted beet salad, mushroom flatbreads, a signature ""Harvest Burger"" that Lily said was our best seller.

""It's a house blend,"" she explained during a slow Tuesday afternoon. ""Mom designed the recipe herself. Soy base, but with this umami depth that makes people think it's real meat. We get people coming back three, four times a week for it.""

I'd tried one on my second day. It was good. Rich. Almost *too* rich, like the fat content was higher than it should've been for a plant-based patty. But I was getting free meals, so I wasn't complaining.

Maria ate constantly.

That was the thing I noticed first, not as a red flag, just as a fact. She'd hover near the line during lunch rush, pinching bits of roasted chicken from the tray (we offered one meat option for ""flexitarians,"" Lily had explained apologetically). She'd taste the burger mix straight from the bowl, licking her fingers between batches. She'd saw off chunks of bread with her bare hands, crumbs falling onto her apron, grease smearing her chin.

""Gotta make sure the quality's consistent,"" she'd say, mouth full, eyes on me like she was daring me to comment.

I didn't.

It was week three when I started feeling weird about the staff meals.

We were required to eat them. Not suggested;  *Required*. ""Part of the Harvest Table experience,"" Maria said. ""If you're serving it, you gotta believe in it.""

I'd been eating the Harvest Burger two, sometimes three times a week. It was convenient, free, and honestly, I'd started craving it. That rich, savory depth. The way it sat heavy in your stomach, satisfying in a way that leftovers from home never were.

But one Thursday, mid-bite, I felt something *wrong* in my mouth.

Not taste. Texture.

I froze. Reached in with my fingers. Pulled out a small, white crescent,  hard and smooth, curved like a fragment of shell.

Except we didn't use shellfish.

I stared at it. Turned it over in my palm.

It looked like a fingernail.

""Everything okay?""

I looked up. Lily was standing in the doorway, head tilted, concerned.

I closed my fist. ""Yeah. Just bit my cheek. I'm good.""

She smiled, relieved. ""Okay. Don't scare me like that.""

I threw the rest of the burger away when she left.

I haven't been able to finish one since.

But here's the thing: I didn't quit.

I *should* have. I know that now. But the rent was paid. My health insurance had kicked in. And Lily had started asking me to stay late, help her close, walk her to her car because the parking lot lighting was bad.

""I like having you here,"" she said one night, locking the front door while I wiped down the last table. ""You're not like the last guy. He was always trying to cut corners, complaining about the sourcing costs. He didn't *get* it.""

""What happened to him?""

She paused. ""He quit. Just stopped showing up one day.""

""Did he say why?""

""No."" She looked at me, and for just a second, something flickered across her face. Something I couldn't read. ""People don't always appreciate what we're doing here. But I think you do.""

I should've asked more questions.

I didn't.

Yesterday, Lily asked if I wanted to visit one of the farms.

We were closing, the kitchen finally quiet after a long Saturday rush. She'd been talking about the suppliers again.  Her usual script about transparency, sustainability, knowing your food's story.

""I'm going out to Silas Creek tomorrow,"" she said. ""One of our main protein sources. It's about an hour north. You should come.""

""I don't know, I—""

""Please?"" She looked at me, and I swear to god, I would've followed her anywhere. ""I want you to see it. I want you to understand what makes this place different.""

So I said yes.

We're leaving in four hours.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe because I need a record. Maybe because some part of me knows I shouldn't go.

But I'm going.

I'll update when I get time.

Recipes with my commentary:

[Pumpkin Roll](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/classic-pumpkin-roll/) \- 8/10

This was my first time making a roll! I used a nonstick pan and sprayed it with oil and stubbornly did not use parchment paper and I regretted it. Just use the darn parchment paper. My cake ripped when taking it out of the pan, but I still did manage to get a spiral in there. It was delicious! Would make again.

[Earl Grey Buns](https://cloudykitchen.com/blog/2017-4-7-earl-grey-buns/) \- 9/10

I made these last year and they were back by popular demand. The recipe seems overwhelming but it's really just a lot of things mixed with tea lol. They were sweeter than last year (in a bad way) so next time I will reduce the sugar. I doubled the recipe and had a hard time infusing the milk, I felt like the tea soaked up too much and I didn't have enough milk yet, so infuse more milk than it calls for.

[Apple Fritter Cake](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/apple-fritter-cake/) \- 7/10

It was fine. A cake with apples on it. I was expecting more, but I'm not a big cake person so maybe that's not fair. It called for a 9x9 which I didn't have so I used an 8x8 and it was a bit too tall. I think it would be better to have done a 9x13 and have a shorter cake and reduce the cooking time.

[Coffee Cream Puffs](https://pintsizedbaker.com/coffee-cream-puffs/) \- 10/10

I'm a huge cream puff fan. The recipe called for 24 small ones but I made 12 big ones. I didn't quite have enough filling (of course, because they were bigger) so I should have doubled the filling. Instead of slicing the puffs I just piped the cream right in. Will definitely make again.

[Kouign-Amann](https://my100yearoldhome.com/how-to-bake-kouign-amann/) \- 9/10

We had these on a trip to France and I had to give them a try. I hate laminating dough so I found them a real pain to make (probably user error. The dough kept ripping and exposing the butter which stuck to my rolling pin, it was a whole thing.) Unfortunately they tasted SO good. It's basically like a sugar croissant. However, I thought I was being so clever using paper liner so they wouldn't stick to the tin, but they all stuck to the paper liner. An hour of peeling bits of paper later, they were very tasty. I had to cut off some burnt parts after only 45 min (recipe calls for 45-60 min) so make sure to keep an eye on them from 30 min onwards.

[Apple Cheddar Twists](https://www.allrecipes.com/apple-cheddar-twists-recipe-8709986) \- 6/10

I was expecting more. I love apple and cheddar together, I think it would have been better in a tart form rather than a twist? I liked that the recipe called for grating the apples rather than slicing them.

[Focaccia](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/big-and-bubbly-focaccia-recipe) (topped with avocado) - 7/10

I was so sure that because it was a King Arthur Recipe, it would be an excellent focaccia. But I've made a lot of different focaccia recipes, and this one seemed to take more work for a meh result. It was still tasty, but not super dimpled. 

[Onion & Goat Cheese Tart](https://www.seriouseats.com/caramelized-onion-and-goat-cheese-tartlets-recipe) \- 10/10

This was the favourite of the day. It was so simple to put together but so tasty. 

Overall this took me 10 hours the day before and 3 hours the morning of to put together. The bread items I let rise in the fridge overnight and baked in the morning. 

Last year the menu was: creme brulee donuts, earl grey rolls, spinach puffs, savoury dutch baby, focaccia, pavlova with fruit, shakshuka, and candied bacon. ",5,1761667057.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

I'm very happy to share GlyphGL, a new minimal project I wrote from scratch that requires **zero dependencies**   
It's a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Macos) header only C/C++ library designed for simplicity and absolute control (is still under development)   
**No FreeType:** It contains it's own ttf parser, rasterizer and renderer  
**No OpenGL Loader:** GlyphGL includes it's own built in loader that handles all necessary OpenGL functions and pointers across many platforms, although it can be disabled using `GLYPH_NO_GL_LOADER`   
**Compatibility:** GlyphGL is written with C99 syntax, meaning it can be ported easily to other platforms  
**Performance:** Although still under development and lacking heavy optimizations (like SDF rendering and other advanced techniques), GlyphGL remains notably fast thanks to its efficient batch rendering system

i'm open to criticism to help this project improve and grow, so if you find any issues, bug or need some clarifications, please comment or pull an issue in the repo!

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

So prior to the pandemic, it has already happened. He would wear my slippers or slip-ons out despite he already has his own. My feet size is 1 size bigger than his. I had to scold him because it inconvenienced me and I don't have any footwear to wear out (I can't wear his since it was 1 size smaller). And he would be out the whole day.

One day, he did it again and I messaged him to scold him for it. He merely replied, ""What are you so angry for? Just wear shoes then.""   I was like wtf but okay, I do not want to disrespect him in any way nor scold him anymore... I just didn't want to ruin both of our mood/day.

He told me he has stopped the habit and I was glad. I even bought him 2 new pair of slippers - a sandal and a slip-ons. Their design were just like mine and they're comfortable. He thanked me but never wore them and insist on wearing his old ones, so I let him be. Then, later, he told me he doesn't like the 2 pairs I bought for him. It was unused even and he didn't even bother trying them on for a day. I just donated them to goodwill.

So later on, one day, I was about to go out when I wore my slip-ons and I realized it was wet. I looked closely and there were mud AND coffee stains. I messaged him and he admits he wore it in the morning during his morning walks and while grabbing a coffee at a cafe and he spilled it over. He said he has washed it but it was a bad job because I could still see the mud and coffee stains. Also, you CAN'T JUST WASH LEATHER. I can't wear them that day and had to dry them under the sun.  He didn't even told me about it being wet and whatnot, he just put it back at the shelf and wore his own pair and faster left the house after that. I was  dead mad but just gave him the silent treatment. I honestly felt he's disrespecting my boundaries. And, no surprise, my leather slip-ons started having that awful smell from the wetness and it gradually spoilt.

Later,I thought all's fine and well. I thought he has finally stopped this weird bad habit. I bought him another pair of slippers and he says he likes it. I see him wearing it every time. I also bought another new pair for myself, and kept my old pair as a spare and for grocery shopping and whatnot.

So just yesterday, I caught him again. I woke up and went to my front porch and I saw him returning home from his morning walks. I saw him wearing the old pair of slippers of mine. I politely asked him why and he didn't answer me but just chuckle.  It just pisses me off even more.

Why the hell is he doing this?

He even wore my running shoes as outing shoes before and he never asked me. Once, he went for his morning walks and even wore my running shoes and it stink up the shoe real badly.

TL;DR: Despite buying pairs of slipper sfor my dad, he keeps wearing mine and even my old ones.",2,1761666888.0,family,1,1.0,False
1oid575,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oid575/ideal_beginner_setup_recommendations_1300/,"Ideal Beginner Setup Recommendations [$1,300]","Hello Reddit! I need your advice on what my first espresso setup should be. There are so many choices and it's becoming a lot to take it. I've been lurking on this thread for some time, and decided it's time to ask you all directly ;)

  
A bit about me and what I'm looking for: 

\- I am an espresso beginner (have pulled a few shots with friends' machines, but this would be my first setup). I don't see myself getting sooo deep into all of the intricacies of espresso quite yet, but I would still like a great, quality, and well-built machine that is 1. easy enough for me to use, and 2. will  grow with me as I gain more experience. 

\- I like to drink lattes and cappuccinos, so I will be making milk drinks and would like to be able to make those fairly quick/easy (I understand that this may be somewhat limited given my budget). I'll likely make 1-2 lattes at a time, so it would be great to have a machine that could handle a couple back-to-back drinks.

\- I am the type of person who needs a coffee ASAP after waking up, so I also care a bit about how long it takes the machine to warm up / how long in total until I'm sipping a latte. I value great espresso, but also quick turnaround :) I understand that I may have to compromise some here. 

\- This is not my end-all setup. My mom is kind enough to get this for me as a birthday gift, so this machine will be for me to use daily for the next 5-10 years (ideally as long as possible), until I have some ""adult money"" of my own to invest in a super great machine. I don't want a machine that may stop working on me in 3 or so years...I value quality and longevity! 

\- Since this is not my end-all setup and I am planning to upgrade eventually, I truly wouldn't mind having a machine that has a built in grinder. I know that is a CARDINAL SIN in this community, but it is not the most important thing for me. I want ease, quality, and also a small footprint! When it does come time to upgrade, I'll likely upgrade the whole setup anyway - so I'm not so worried about the ease of upgrading that comes with the separate setup. 

\- And finally, aesthetics are important to me <3 which is why I'm okay with a built-in grinder (if it's good, of course). If I got a separate grinder, I would want it to match the machine. I don't love the Bambino Plus for this reason, because 1. I don't love the look of it, and 2. I haven't found a grinder that looks great with it. 

\- While I'm not paying for the machine for myself, I would still like to be conscious of the budget! So, if there is a better machine/set up that fits my criteria and is available for a less money, I would be very interested!

  
Some machines that I've been looking at: 

I started my search with Breville, but have heard some stories about them not being the best quality. Currently, I'm super interested in Lelit - I like the way they look and they seem to be great quality (and I like that they're made in Italy). Specifically, I am looking at the Lelit Anna machine + Lelit Fred grinder (is the Fred grinder any good? I haven't seen much about it on this thread). I am also super interested in the Lelit Kate machine/grinder combo...I like the way it looks and it seems to be great quality! (I SUPER love the Lelit Bianca...and I think that is the machine I would buy in \~10 years when I upgrade. It is so gorgeous!!)

However, I have seen that these Lelit machines can take a bit (10-15 minutes) to heat up. My question is, is that time normal for my budget? Or is there a machine that is better AND would heat up faster? I don't want to sacrifice quality just to save time heating up...

Let me know if I'm missing any info that would help you make recommendations.

\-I'm in my early 30's. I look very young and am a touring musician. Going to a small town type church.

\-There is a cute 18 y.o.varisty cheerleader at this small church. She has a crush on me and always does things to try to get my attention.

\-Her grandma likes me a lot.

\-Her Grandma and I brought up gifts during mass and the priest was visibly annoyed I was walking with the grandma and yanked the chalice (with light force) out of my hand. When he talked to me, you could hear the annoyance in his voice. I was like ""WTF""? to myself. 

\-There is another college aged girl in front and she is jealous of the cheerleader and also always tries to get my attention. 

\-I asked the priest about the college girl. I mentioned to him that I saw her and said hey when I was getting some coffee and she was there behind the counter. He almost freaked out and said ""Don't talk to her outside of church"". Again.. WTF?

\-College girl's dad doesn't like me for whatever reason (I never met hi) and actually stalked me a couple time in the parking lot. I know he has donated a ton of money to the church. After that, I started getting ""side eyes"", and ""dirty looks"" from the deacon and others..... (PSA... If you're Catholic, remain neutered and don't try and find out more about women when they give you signals....ugh).

\-One time I came back from a big tour and went to say hello and went to shake his hand. You could see he seemed off and gave me the biggest ""dead fish"" hand shake I ever got in my life. The tone of his voice just seemed....Off...I have no idea why as I did nothing wrong. After the tour, the girls were really nice to me. The guys seemed pretty off.

\-Priest was one who could never find a wife and became a priest in his late 40's. Could he be jealous? I doubt it, but I wonder if that factors in. He always seems to be pushing single men joining the priest hood over marriage. 

\-The funniest part? I sit in the back alone and haven't talked to anyone except the grandma, another older lady and the granddaughter a couple times. Once I started looking into this girl more, I became public enemy number one.

It is me, my mom, my younger brother, and my grandma’s little flip line. The total after taxes is 164 per month, I cover it on autopay and they pay me back with Zelle. Mom is 54 and very smart in general, but she taps yes on every random text that pops up because the message says it is urgent. This month was the third time her approvals messed up my stuff. First time, back in April, some ""delivery"" text asked her to verify a package. She hit the link, entered her number, then a code, and my Instagram got hit with a login from a different state. Mild chaos, I reset things, taught her about fake links. Second time in July, a ""bank alert"" text asked to confirm a $980 purchase. She clicked, typed the code that came to her phone, and my checking locked for 24 hours while I was trying to pay a plumber. I was embarrased and kind of mad, but I kept it cool, turned on more 2FA, removed SMS from everything I could, moved to an authenticator app. Thought we were ok.

Last Thursday it got worse. At 7 12 am I was making coffee and my watch buzzed, new sign in attempt for my email. I hit no. Thirty seconds later, same thing, but the code went to my mom’s phone, not to me. She was at work already, she saw a text saying ""Your email is being accessed, reply YES to secure your mailbox."" She replied yes. Then more codes. By 7 23 my email and two cloud drives started spitting alerts. At 7 31 my Git hosting locked my account for unusual activity because someone tried a password reset. I work remote, I had a client standup at 9, my stomach felt like ice. I called Mom, asked her what she tapped. She said ""I thought I was helping you, the text said to confirm you blocked the hacker."" I asked her to bring her phone by my place or at least read the sender. She sent me screenshots, all short codes with weird grammar. My brother thinks I am overreacting, he says everyone gets phished sometimes. But I am the one who pays the plan and my identity is the one tied to the master account. I spent four hours on support that day, froze my credit, rotated recovery emails, killed every SMS fallback I could find. I missed half my standup and then my boss joked I should staple my phone to my hand. Not funny. I felt like crying in the shower after, head pounding, coffee went cold on the counter and tasted like ash when I finally took a sip at noon.

I talked to Mom that night. She said she is ""just not good with phones"" and asked me to stop being dramatic. I offered three options. One, she takes my little security bootcamp, 45 minutes on a Saturday, I show her what to tap and what not, we practice with fake messages, and I set her phone so unknown senders get filtered. Two, I move her line to prepaid in her name, I will pay the early transfer fee, about 60, and she can manage it how she wants. Three, if she wants to stay on my plan, I suspend SMS based recovery entirely and remove her number from any shared logins, and if I see another yes to a random code I will suspend her line for a week as a time out. She got angry, said that is controlling and that she needs her phone because she volunteers at church and Grandma calls her. I get that, I love them both. But I am tired of cleaning up fires. My credit card fraud team called today about a new attempt and I swallowed hard in the grocery line at 6 18 pm because my cart was already at 84 and I did not want to hold up the line if the card got declined.

Important detail, I am not trying to punish my mom, I am trying to protect my accounts and my job. The plan is still cheaper for everyone with my discount, but the risks keep stacking. If I suspend her line for a week after another approval, that stops the codes from landing and buys me time to lock things down. It feels harsh though. Would I be the jerk if I enforce this boundary and actually suspend her line next time, or is this a reasonable consequence for a pattern that is now hurting me in very real and very expensive ways.

I know they mean well, but their advice is so outdated it's almost comical, and they just won't accept how much things have changed.



My dad, for instance, keeps telling me to just go down to the local business park and start knocking on doors. He's convinced that if I just show up with a firm handshake and ask to speak to a manager, I'll get an interview on the spot. I keep trying to explain that's the fastest way to get escorted out by security, not offered a job.



We were at a coffee shop a couple of weeks ago, and he asked the barista if they were hiring. The kid said, ""Yeah, but you have to apply online. Tbh, it took them three months just to get back to me for an interview."" The look of absolute shock on my dad's face was something else. Later, I said, ""See? That's what I'm talking about. It takes forever to hear anything back."" He just shook his head.



I feel like they're constantly judging me for being on my computer all day, thinking I'm not trying hard enough. They don't grasp that the ""Hi, need a worker? Great, you're hired!"" days are long gone. The idea that everything is filtered through online portals and automated systems is completely foreign to them.



It's driving me completely insane because they keep saying, ""But that's how we got our jobs!"" Yeah, folks, that was back in the seventies. The world is a little different now.



My mom even gets frustrated that I send my resume to my cousin to look over. My cousin is literally an HR manager, but my mom thinks she knows better. She wants me to put my full home address and a photo on it things that every career coach and guide online explicitly says will get your resume thrown in the trash.



Honestly, if I had a dollar for every time I've had to say ""The world doesn't work that way anymore,"" I'd be rich enough to retire and wouldn't even need a job. I've been a hiring manager before myself, and even my own direct experience isn't enough to convince them.",4,1761666660.0,interviewhammer,1,1.0,False

Part I — The Arrival

The sand spread in a long pale curve beneath the cabin, smooth and wet from the retreating tide. The ocean stretched beyond it, iron gray under the overcast sky. A low wind came off the water carrying the scent of rot and salt. Hunter stood on the small deck and watched the waves break against the rock ledge below. He felt the tremor of them through the wood boards and tried to imagine the sand beneath the water, heavy and cold, pressed flat by the weight of the sea.

Isaiah was inside unpacking. Hunter could hear the dull thud of their bags and the hollow sound of the cupboards opening. The cabin had been closed for months. Dust drifted in the slanting light and every surface felt faintly damp. The place belonged to Isaiah’s uncle, a fisherman who had drowned years ago when his trawler went down just off the cove. Hunter had seen the memorial plaque nailed to the dock when they arrived. The metal had gone green around the edges.

They had come here to fix things, or at least that was what Isaiah had said. The city had become unbearable, the apartment too small, the arguments too frequent. Out here, Isaiah believed, they could start over. There was no one for miles, only the whisper of the tide and the endless sound of the surf against the rocks.

When Hunter finally went inside, the light had dimmed to a dull blue. Isaiah was in the kitchen washing a plate in the sink. The water ran rusty for a few seconds before clearing. The smell of iron filled the air. Isaiah turned and smiled faintly.

“Still works,” he said. “That’s a good sign.”

Hunter nodded. He ran a hand through his hair and looked around the cabin. There was one small bedroom, a sitting room with a couch that sagged in the middle, and a narrow hallway that led to a back door facing the dunes. Everything had a film of grit on it. A single picture hung above the fireplace showing a fishing boat being tossed on black water. The frame leaned slightly to one side.

They ate a small dinner of canned soup and bread. Isaiah talked more than Hunter did. He talked about the new start they needed, about how silence might help them find something that had been lost between them. Hunter listened but his eyes kept drifting to the window, to the line where the sea met the horizon. In the fading light the water looked like liquid metal. There was a faint shimmer in it that didn’t seem tied to the reflection of the sky.

That night they lay together in the narrow bed. The window above them had no curtain. Through it the moon was a dull white smudge behind the clouds. The waves came and went like a slow mechanical pulse. Hunter couldn’t sleep. Isaiah’s breathing was uneven beside him, shallow, catching now and then as if his lungs had forgotten the rhythm of rest. Hunter reached out and touched his shoulder, but Isaiah didn’t stir. His skin felt cooler than it should have.

Sometime near dawn Hunter dreamed that the tide rose higher than the beach, flooding the sand until it touched the steps of the cabin. He dreamed he was standing barefoot on the porch, water swirling around his ankles. Something moved beneath it, brushing against his skin. When he woke the sheets were damp with sweat and the air was thick with the scent of salt.

Outside, the sky was pale and colorless. Isaiah was already awake, sitting at the table with a mug of coffee. He was staring at nothing. The steam from the cup curled in front of his face.

“You were talking in your sleep,” Isaiah said quietly.

Hunter rubbed his eyes. “What did I say?”

Isaiah shrugged. “Something about the water. You kept saying not to look down.”

Hunter tried to laugh, but it came out dry. “Guess it’s already getting to me.”

Isaiah smiled faintly but didn’t answer.

They decided to walk the shoreline after breakfast. The tide was out, revealing long ribbons of kelp tangled in the sand. The air had that heavy stillness that comes before a storm. The cabin looked small and colorless against the gray dunes behind them. Hunter picked up a shell half buried near the water. The inside shimmered faintly, almost pearlescent. When he turned it, he saw that the inner surface wasn’t smooth. It had a pattern that looked like veins running in all directions.

Isaiah wandered ahead, his figure blurring in the mist. Hunter watched him move closer to the rocks where the waves hit hardest. A dark opening cut into the cliffside there, a kind of shallow cave. Isaiah called back that he was going to look inside. Hunter followed reluctantly, the wet sand sucking at his shoes.

The cave smelled of brine and decay. The walls were slick with algae and barnacles. Isaiah was crouched near the back where a pool of seawater had gathered in a hollow. He dipped his fingers in it and brought them to his lips before Hunter could stop him.

“What are you doing?” Hunter said sharply.

Isaiah laughed softly. “It tastes strange. Sweet almost.”

Hunter frowned. The water looked wrong. It was too dark, and something beneath the surface pulsed faintly, as if the pool had a heartbeat of its own.

“Let’s go,” Hunter said. “You’re going to make yourself sick.”

But Isaiah didn’t move. His expression had gone distant. “Do you hear that?” he whispered.

Hunter listened. At first there was only the echo of waves outside, but then, beneath it, a low humming sound seemed to rise from the stone. It was deep, resonant, like the vibration of something enormous moving far below. The air in the cave felt charged, the hairs on Hunter’s arms standing up.

“Come on,” Hunter said again, taking Isaiah’s arm. Isaiah blinked as if waking from a trance and followed him out.

The wind had picked up by the time they reached the cabin again. The ocean was darker now, streaked with whitecaps. Hunter couldn’t shake the feeling that the horizon had shifted slightly closer. Isaiah said he was fine, though his skin had a faint sheen of sweat and his eyes seemed glassy. He insisted it was just excitement from the walk.

By evening the rain began. It came in slow sheets, whispering against the windows. The lights flickered once but held. Hunter cooked what little food they had while Isaiah sat near the window, staring at the sea. Every few minutes he would reach up and rub at his throat like something irritated him.

When Hunter joined him, Isaiah leaned against him and said quietly, “I keep thinking about that pool. It felt alive.”

Hunter tried to smile. “It was just seawater.”

Isaiah shook his head. “No. There was something in it.”

Hunter didn’t answer. He wanted to tell Isaiah about the way the ground seemed to hum beneath his feet when they left the cave, but he didn’t. He didn’t want to feed it. The air inside the cabin was thick, damp, smelling faintly of seaweed though all the windows were closed.

They sat like that for a long time, the rain blurring the view outside into streaks of gray. Eventually Isaiah turned and kissed him. The kiss tasted faintly metallic. Hunter felt a warmth rise through him, heavy and slow, and then a strange pull in his chest, as if something inside him leaned toward Isaiah’s heartbeat.

When they broke apart Isaiah’s eyes were dilated. He smiled, but it didn’t look like him anymore. There was something hungry behind it. Hunter told himself it was just the dim light.

They went to bed early, though neither of them slept much. The storm grew louder through the night, waves crashing closer than before. At one point Hunter got up to check the door and saw water pooling at the edge of the steps. He couldn’t tell if the tide had risen or if the land itself had sunk slightly lower. The boards of the cabin groaned as if settling under a new weight.

When he turned back toward the bed, Isaiah was sitting up. The light from the window fell across his face, and for a second Hunter thought he saw thin lines tracing down his neck, like pale veins glowing faintly beneath the skin. Isaiah looked at him and said softly, “It’s in us now.”

Hunter stared at him. “What is?”

Isaiah blinked slowly. “The sea.”

Part II — The Change

Morning came as a dull gray light pressing through the clouds. The air inside the cabin was still heavy, tinged with the smell of salt and wood rot. Hunter woke first. The tide had receded, leaving long lines of dark kelp across the sand outside. The storm had scattered shells and driftwood along the beach. The horizon looked distorted, as if the ocean surface were slightly curved upward in the distance.

Isaiah lay beside him, motionless except for the slow rise and fall of his chest. His skin looked pale. The faint lines Hunter had seen the night before were still there, tracing delicate patterns down his neck and over his collarbone like fine cracks in porcelain. When Hunter touched them, Isaiah stirred and smiled without opening his eyes.

“Morning,” he whispered. His voice was hoarse.

“Are you alright?” Hunter asked.

“Just tired.”

Hunter went to boil water for coffee. The kettle took longer than it should have to heat. The flame on the old gas stove burned a sickly orange. When he poured the water into the mugs it smelled faintly briny, as though salt had crept into the plumbing. He tried not to think about it.

Isaiah sat at the table, rubbing his hands together. His nails looked darker, stained near the cuticles. Hunter noticed small cuts along his fingers, thin and symmetrical like scratches made by coral. Isaiah caught him staring and tucked his hands under the table.

“Must’ve scraped them on the rocks yesterday,” he said.

Hunter nodded but didn’t answer. His own throat felt dry. He drank the coffee and found it bitter, metallic, as if the water had drawn something from the pipes.

Outside, the wind had died but the sea still rolled heavily. They decided to walk again, staying close to the dunes. The sand was cold and firm under their feet. Sea foam clung to the edges of the waterline, forming shapes that dissolved as soon as Hunter tried to focus on them. Isaiah walked a few steps ahead, his posture rigid. Every now and then he would stop and tilt his head as if listening to something distant.

Hunter called to him, but Isaiah didn’t answer. He knelt near the surf, letting the waves break over his hands. When he stood again, water dripped down his wrists, thicker than it should have been, almost viscous. He watched it slide down his skin, fascinated.

“I can feel it moving,” Isaiah said quietly.

“What?”

“The water. Inside me.”

Hunter took a step back. “Isaiah, stop. You need to rest.”

Isaiah turned to him. His pupils were wide, swallowing most of the iris. “It’s not bad. It’s warm.”

He smiled again, but there was no warmth in it. Hunter felt a pressure behind his eyes, a subtle ache that pulsed in rhythm with the sound of the waves. He wanted to leave the beach, to go anywhere else, but Isaiah was already walking toward the rocks again. The entrance to the cave yawned black against the cliff.

“Don’t,” Hunter said, his voice sharper than he intended.

Isaiah paused. “It’s calling. You hear it too, don’t you?”

Hunter wanted to deny it, but there was a low hum in the air again, almost inaudible, just beneath the range of hearing. It vibrated in his teeth, in the bones of his jaw. The sound came from beneath the earth, or from beneath the sea itself. He felt it more than heard it.

Isaiah stepped into the cave. Hunter followed reluctantly.

The pool inside had changed. The water was no longer dark but clouded, swirling faintly even though nothing moved the surface. A faint glow came from its depths, pale and green. The light played across the slick walls, casting shifting shadows that looked like hands reaching.

Isaiah knelt beside it. “It’s beautiful.”

“Don’t touch it,” Hunter said, but Isaiah already had. He dipped both hands into the pool. The glow intensified. Ripples spread outward, touching the edges of the rock. The hum grew louder. Hunter stumbled back as the sound filled the small space.

Isaiah turned his head slowly. His skin was glistening now, covered in a sheen that looked like seawater but didn’t drip. It clung to him, transparent and quivering. When he spoke, his voice had a strange echo to it, as if another voice spoke a fraction of a second behind him.

“It’s part of us,” Isaiah said. “It’s what we came for.”

Hunter grabbed him by the arm and pulled him away from the pool. The surface stilled at once, the light fading until it was only murky water again. Isaiah’s arm was cold and slick beneath Hunter’s grip, but he followed without resistance. Outside, the air felt thin, almost too light to breathe. Hunter’s heart hammered as they climbed back toward the cabin.

Inside, Isaiah collapsed onto the couch. He looked feverish, his lips pale. Hunter wrapped him in a blanket and sat beside him, trying to ignore the faint dampness that seeped through the fabric. For a long time neither of them spoke. The sound of the surf filled the silence, slower now, like a heartbeat.

“I can feel it in you too,” Isaiah whispered. His eyes were half-lidded. “It’s not just me.”

Hunter shook his head. “You’re sick, that’s all.”

Isaiah smiled faintly. “Then you’re sick too.”

Hunter wanted to argue but found he couldn’t. His own skin felt clammy, the air against it too heavy. When he looked at his reflection in the window, he thought he saw something shift beneath the surface of his neck, a flicker of movement that vanished when he touched it.

He turned away and forced himself to focus on the mundane. He checked the cupboards, the generator, anything to keep his hands busy. But the hum was still there, faint and constant, threading through the silence like a pulse beneath the world.

By late afternoon Isaiah was asleep, his breathing shallow. Hunter sat beside him, watching the slow rise and fall of his chest. The faint lines on his neck had spread, branching outward. When Hunter brushed a strand of hair aside, he saw that the skin beneath was translucent. Beneath it something moved, a slow undulation like the rhythm of waves.

Hunter went outside to clear his head. The tide had risen again, farther than before. Foam lapped at the first steps of the porch. The sand beyond was littered with small fish that twitched weakly before going still. The air was perfectly still, no wind at all, yet the surface of the water trembled constantly, like the sea itself was breathing.

He looked toward the horizon. The line between water and sky had blurred. The ocean seemed to go on forever, no longer flat but curving upward as though it wanted to close around the world.

When he went back inside, Isaiah was gone.

The door to the back of the cabin stood open. Footprints led through the damp sand toward the dunes. Hunter followed, his heart hammering. The prints were shallow, filled with a faint shimmering liquid instead of water. He called Isaiah’s name but only the sound of the sea answered.

He found him near the edge of the dunes, kneeling. His clothes were soaked. He was staring at his hands, holding them up to the gray light. The skin there had thinned, and beneath it Hunter saw veins that shimmered faintly, like strands of silver.

“I can hear them,” Isaiah said without looking up.

“Hear who?”

“The ones below. They’re waiting.”

Hunter knelt beside him. “We need to go back inside.”

Isaiah turned his head slowly. His eyes caught the light in an unnatural way, reflecting it back like the surface of water. “You can’t run from something that’s already inside you.”

Hunter felt a wave of nausea. “You’re not making sense.”

Isaiah reached out and touched his face. The touch was cold, almost soothing. “You will. Soon.”

That night the storm returned, heavier than before. Rain lashed the windows. The power flickered and went out. The world outside was reduced to sound, the constant roar of the sea against the walls. Hunter lit the small oil lamp and sat by Isaiah’s side. The light flickered across his face, revealing the glistening sheen that now covered his skin entirely.

Isaiah shivered once, then exhaled a slow sigh. “It’s so close now.”

Hunter swallowed. “What is?”

Isaiah smiled. “Home.”

Hunter tried to wake him but he had already slipped into sleep, or something like it. His breathing slowed until it matched the rhythm of the waves. Hunter felt the same rhythm in his own chest, an involuntary syncopation that frightened him. He pressed his palm against his sternum and felt warmth radiate outward, a spreading heat that wasn’t entirely his own.

Hours passed. The rain softened. The only light came from the faint glow beneath Isaiah’s skin. It pulsed gently, casting shifting reflections on the walls. Hunter sat motionless, listening to the soft whisper of the sea against the door, and realized that he could understand it now. Not as words, but as meaning. It spoke of merging, of dissolution, of peace beyond separation. The sound filled his mind until he no longer knew if it was coming from outside or from within.

He closed his eyes, and in the darkness behind his eyelids he saw the same glow, vast and endless, spreading beneath the ocean floor. Shapes moved within it, immense and slow, their outlines fading into the distance. He felt their presence the way one feels the gravity of the earth, constant and inescapable.

When he opened his eyes again, the glow from Isaiah’s body had dimmed, but a faint trace of it lingered in the air between them, a mist that shimmered before fading. Hunter reached out instinctively. The mist clung to his fingers, cold and wet, then sank into his skin without a trace.

A deep vibration rolled through the floorboards, subtle but unmistakable, as if something vast had shifted far below. The oil lamp flickered once and went out.

Hunter sat in the darkness, listening to the sound of the sea pressing closer.

Part III — The Merging

The morning arrived without light. A dense fog pressed against the windows, pale and motionless. The sound of the ocean was no longer rhythmic but constant, a deep, unbroken roar that filled the cabin. It was as if the sea had moved closer during the night and now breathed just beyond the walls.

Hunter woke on the floor beside the couch. He couldn’t remember lying down. The boards beneath him were cold and faintly damp. Isaiah was still asleep, wrapped in the blanket. The glow beneath his skin had faded to a dim shimmer, yet his breathing carried a strange resonance, as though air passed through water inside his chest.

When Hunter sat up, his joints cracked softly. A film of moisture coated his arms. He wiped it away, but his skin stayed slick, no matter how many times he dried it. He could feel his pulse, not as a single beat but as a current flowing beneath his flesh.

He stood and walked to the window. The fog outside was thick enough to hide the shore. Only a faint motion revealed the sea beyond, a slow undulation that blurred the line between land and water. He thought he could see the outline of something beneath the surface, moving parallel to the coast. It was too large to be a wave.

Behind him, Isaiah stirred.

Hunter turned. Isaiah’s eyes were open, reflecting the pale fog light. His voice came out softer than before, yet it carried the same echo that had haunted the cave.

“It’s changing,” Isaiah whispered. “Everything is.”

Hunter knelt beside him. “We need to leave. The tide’s coming in too high. The road will flood.”

Isaiah smiled faintly. “There’s nowhere to go.”

He reached for Hunter’s hand. His touch was cold but alive, thrumming with some internal rhythm. Beneath his skin, faint patterns shifted like the movement of fish in shallow water. Hunter pulled back instinctively, but Isaiah’s fingers lingered against his wrist. A warmth spread from the contact, traveling up his arm in a slow pulse.

Hunter gasped and stumbled to his feet. The warmth didn’t fade; it deepened, twisting inside him until it became a pressure in his chest. He pressed his palm against his ribs and felt something move beneath them—a faint flexing that wasn’t his heartbeat.

Isaiah rose too, unsteady but calm. “You feel it, don’t you?” he said. “It’s what connects us.”

Hunter backed away. “You’re sick. Both of us are. It’s that water. We just need to—”

“Stop pretending,” Isaiah said. “It doesn’t hurt if you stop fighting.”

Hunter shook his head. “You don’t know what it’s doing to you.”

Isaiah stepped forward. The fog light caught his face, revealing subtle changes that Hunter hadn’t noticed before. The planes of his features had softened, as though something beneath his skin had begun to reshape him. His pupils shone faintly. There was a stillness to his movements that didn’t belong to any living thing.

He lifted his hand and placed it against Hunter’s chest. “Listen,” he said.

Hunter froze. Beneath Isaiah’s palm he felt the faint thrum of his own heart, but also something else—a vibration that matched Isaiah’s pulse perfectly. For a moment the two rhythms aligned, beating together. The pressure in his chest lessened, replaced by a strange calm. The fear that had driven him seemed to dissolve, leaving behind only a dull awe.

Isaiah leaned closer until their foreheads touched. His breath smelled faintly of the sea. “It’s not trying to hurt us,” he whispered. “It wants us whole.”

The calm shattered. Hunter pulled back sharply. The contact broke, and the pressure inside him returned with a violent surge. He stumbled against the wall, gasping. A dull ache spread through his limbs, heavy and wet. His vision blurred. For an instant the cabin tilted, as if the floor had turned to liquid.

When the dizziness passed, he found Isaiah watching him with an unreadable expression.

“It’s already begun,” Isaiah said softly.

Hunter fell to his knees. He wanted to argue, to say something rational, but the words dissolved before reaching his mouth. He could feel the sea inside him—the push and pull of tides beneath his ribs, the faint echo of waves in his pulse. The sound filled his head, drowning out thought.

He stayed there for what felt like hours, breathing shallowly, waiting for it to stop. It never did.

By the time he could stand again, the fog had darkened to silver. The air vibrated faintly, a pressure that seemed to come from the ground. Isaiah was standing near the window, his hands pressed against the glass. The moisture from his palms left faint trails that glowed for a moment before fading.

“They’re close,” Isaiah said.

“Who?” Hunter asked, his voice weak.

“The ones beneath. The ones that remember.”

Hunter stared at him. The glow from Isaiah’s hands had left faint shapes on the windowpane—spirals, ridges, and branching lines that looked eerily similar to the patterns now spreading across his skin. It wasn’t random. It looked deliberate, as if drawn by instinct rather than thought.

The hum in the floor deepened. The cabin shuddered once, then stilled. From outside came the muffled sound of water against the steps. Hunter turned toward the door. A thin line of seawater was seeping under it, spreading slowly across the boards.

He grabbed their bags, but when he opened the door, the world beyond was gone. The fog had swallowed everything. The beach, the dunes, even the horizon—all erased. Only the faint suggestion of motion beneath the white surface revealed the sea’s presence.

He took a step forward. The air felt heavy, damp, almost fluid. His foot sank slightly, not into sand, but into something softer, pliant. When he lifted it, a faint glistening film stretched and broke between his shoe and the ground.

“Hunter,” Isaiah said behind him, “don’t.”

Hunter turned. Isaiah stood framed in the doorway, the light from the fog illuminating him. His expression was peaceful, almost reverent. The patterns beneath his skin had spread fully now, tracing his arms, his throat, his chest. Each line pulsed faintly, in rhythm with the low sound rising from beneath the earth.

“I see them,” Isaiah said. “They’re waiting just below.”

“Come back inside,” Hunter said, but his voice sounded far away.

Isaiah stepped past him, barefoot, walking toward the fog. The water reached his ankles, then his knees. Each step left a faint trail of light that faded almost instantly. Hunter moved to follow, but his legs felt heavy, as if the air itself resisted him.

“Isaiah!” he shouted. The fog swallowed the name.

For a moment Isaiah’s shape was visible ahead, then it blurred. The mist around him shifted like breath. Hunter thought he saw another figure there, vast and half-seen, its outline rippling through the fog like something beneath the surface of a pond. Then both shapes dissolved.

The roar of the ocean intensified, no longer distant but surrounding him. The ground trembled. Hunter staggered back toward the cabin, but the doorframe warped beneath his hand. The wood was soft and slick. He pushed harder and it gave way, crumbling like wet paper. Inside, the floor was covered in a thin layer of water, reflecting the dim gray light.

He fell to his knees. The reflection of the ceiling above him shimmered, but in it he didn’t see his own face. The reflection looked back with Isaiah’s eyes.

The sight broke something in him. He clutched his head and gasped. His heartbeat raced, then stuttered. Beneath his palms, his skin felt loose, as though the structure beneath it were shifting. A low ringing filled his ears, rising until it was almost musical.

When he opened his eyes again, Isaiah was standing in front of him, dripping with seawater. His expression was serene.

“You don’t have to fight,” Isaiah said.

Hunter shook his head weakly. “You’re not real.”

Isaiah knelt beside him. “I am. And so are you. We’re the same now.”

He reached out. Hunter tried to pull away, but Isaiah’s hand met his chest, and the resistance vanished. The touch was neither solid nor fluid; it passed through the surface of his skin like mist through glass. Warmth flooded Hunter’s body, filling every hollow place. The ache, the fear, the confusion—all dissolved in that warmth.

He saw Isaiah’s face close to his own, but it wasn’t just a face anymore. It was shifting, merging, reflecting his own features and losing them again in a slow tide of motion. Their outlines blurred where they touched. The air around them thickened, carrying a faint light. The hum that had haunted the cabin rose into a single clear note, vibrating through every cell of Hunter’s body.

He tried to breathe and realized he didn’t need to. The air entered him without effort, as if his lungs had already opened to the sea. His skin tingled. The boundary between his flesh and Isaiah’s seemed to dissolve entirely. There was no pain—only the overwhelming sense of release, of weightlessness, of something vast pressing close.

The note held, growing softer but deeper, like the echo of an immense heartbeat somewhere far below. The walls of the cabin trembled. Water seeped up through the floorboards, climbing around them in slow rings. The last thing Hunter saw clearly was Isaiah’s eyes—calm, luminous, filled with the reflection of a world beyond sight.

Then everything folded inward. The room, the fog, the light—all collapsed into the sound of waves, endless and patient.

Part IV – The Descent

The water rose faster than Hunter could think. He didn’t remember falling or standing — one moment he was on the cabin floor, the next, the world tilted, and the sea was there, pouring through the door in a single unbroken sheet. It was no longer waves or tide. It was one continuous movement, as if the ocean had decided to rise.

He stumbled for the table, but it drifted sideways, caught in the slow current filling the room. Isaiah’s voice came faintly through the noise — low, calm, reverent.

“It’s not taking us,” Isaiah said. “It’s calling us.”

The sound of his voice carried through the water like a vibration rather than speech. Each word trembled in Hunter’s chest as much as in his ears. He turned toward the doorway where Isaiah stood half-submerged, his shoulders lit by a pale light that didn’t seem to come from the sky.

“Isaiah, we have to get out,” Hunter said, but the words were swallowed instantly. The water was already to his waist. Coldness sank into his bones; every movement felt slowed by the thick weight pressing against him.

Isaiah didn’t answer. He was looking past Hunter, toward the window, where something enormous moved beneath the surface outside. The glass flexed inward slightly, as if breathing. A shadow passed across it — not a shape, but an absence, darker than the sea itself.

Then the window cracked.

The noise was small, a whisper, followed by another. The cracks spread like veins, webbing outward. Hunter lunged for Isaiah, but the window gave way with a deep, soft sound — not a crash, not even a splash, just surrender. Water folded inward, and the world inverted.

He was pulled under before he could breathe. The shock of salt filled his nose and throat. The world became gray motion and pressure. He couldn’t tell where the surface was — only that everything was falling, turning, collapsing. For a long moment there was no up or down, only the pulse of his heart and the endless rumble around him.

When he opened his eyes, the light was dim but steady. The cabin was gone. Only fragments drifted — boards, the shape of a door, the outline of Isaiah moving slowly in the suspended debris. The sea around them was almost still, lit by a faint glow that seemed to come from below.

Hunter kicked toward him, struggling through the thick water. Every stroke felt heavy, as if the ocean had weight beyond measure. The light grew brighter as he moved, and the space around them widened, revealing what lay beneath.

It wasn’t the ocean floor. It was something else — an expanse of pale surface, smooth and curved, vanishing into shadow on all sides. It pulsed faintly, like the slow rise and fall of breathing. The glow came from within it, rhythmic, patient.

Isaiah drifted downward toward it, arms open, hair floating around his head like a dark halo. Hunter tried to shout, but only bubbles escaped. He reached out, caught Isaiah’s wrist — and the contact burned cold. The skin beneath his fingers was too soft, the texture yielding like something that wasn’t flesh anymore. Isaiah turned toward him. His expression was serene, eyes bright with reflected light.

“It’s not death,” his voice said, though his lips didn’t move. “It’s the beginning.”

Hunter shook his head, bubbles streaming upward. He wanted to pull away, but Isaiah’s hand tightened around his arm, pulling him closer. The light beneath them brightened again, and the surface below began to open — not breaking, but parting, like fabric being drawn aside.

Beyond it was darkness. Not black, but depth — endless and waiting.

The water around them stirred. The current pulled gently, then firmly, until Hunter’s legs were caught. He tried to kick free, but the motion only drew him faster. The pull wasn’t suction; it was gravity inverted, something vast deciding his direction.

He looked back once. Isaiah was no longer fighting. He let the current take him, drifting downward with open eyes and parted lips. The light from below painted his face silver. For a moment, Hunter saw movement behind him — faint shapes sliding just beneath the surface, circling, converging.

Then Isaiah was gone, swallowed by the dark.

Hunter’s chest burned. Instinct screamed for air, but the pressure was too much; his body refused to obey. He kicked again, desperate, but the current only grew stronger. The light flared once more, then dimmed, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. He felt it behind his eyes, in his teeth, inside the marrow of his bones.

Something touched his shoulder. Not a hand. It was softer, larger — a smooth pressure that settled there gently, almost kindly. Another touch followed on his back, then his side. He couldn’t see them, but he could feel them tracing him, mapping the outline of his body as if learning it.

He tried to scream, and the sound became a vibration in the water, echoing back from all sides. The light below responded, brightening again until it filled everything. The pressure increased, and with it came a deep sound — a low, resonant hum that he felt through every nerve.

It wasn’t a voice. It was older than that. But it spoke in a way his body understood.

Join.

The word wasn’t a command. It was inevitability. His body answered before his mind could. The pain of his lungs disappeared. The need for air dissolved. The cold no longer felt cold. The distinction between his limbs and the water blurred. The current no longer pulled him; it moved through him.

He saw Isaiah again ahead, floating in the light. His outline was changing, the edges softening, merging with the glow. Hunter reached for him, but his arm no longer obeyed. It moved too smoothly, too fluidly. When he looked down, his own skin had taken on the same faint shimmer that Isaiah’s had. The light came from within now.

He tried to think of the surface — the cabin, the shore, the sky. But the memories were already fading. The light below pulsed again, and with each pulse, his thoughts scattered a little more. He could feel them leaving him, dissolving into the rhythm of the sea.

The last thing he saw before the light swallowed everything was Isaiah’s face turning toward him one final time. The features were barely human now, eyes wide and depthless, filled with reflected motion. His mouth formed a word Hunter couldn’t hear, but he felt it vibrate through the water — through himself.

Together.

The hum deepened. The pressure built until it became weightless, sound and motion fusing into one continuous vibration. Hunter tried to move, but movement no longer meant anything. His body expanded, broke apart, and reformed in the same instant. The light filled him completely, and for one heartbeat, he felt the enormity of what lay below: countless forms moving in silence, all bound by the same rhythm.

Then there was nothing — no thought, no self, no Hunter. Only the pulse of the ocean and the endless voice beneath it, steady and eternal, whispering in every direction.

We are.

The sea closed over everything.

And it was very, very quiet.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1oictz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1oictz1/most_d2c_brands_are_leaving_3040_revenue_on_the/,Most D2C Brands Are Leaving 30-40% Revenue on the Table (And Don't Even Know It),"Honest question - how many of you are spending more money getting NEW customers than bringing back people who already bought from you?

I've looked at maybe 20 brands over the last year.
Same story every time:

Typical pattern:
60-70% of customers buy once, never come back
For consumables, reorder window is usually 30-60 days
But brands send ""we miss you"" emails at day 90 (way too late)
Meanwhile, repeat customers are worth 4-6x more than one-time buyers
What's wild is - most of those ""lost"" customers would've bought again. They just forgot. Or they saw a competitor at the right moment. Or nobody reminded them when they actually needed to reorder.

Random example from a supplement brand:

They were doing decent revenue but only 35% of customers ever bought a second time. Their product was a 45-day supply.

They were reaching out at day 90. By then, customer already forgot about them or bought from someone else.

Just changed the timing - started reminding people at day 40-50 (right before they'd run out). Also added SMS and WhatsApp since not everyone checks email.

Repeat purchase rate went to 58% within a few months. Same product, same price, literally just better timing.

That's an extra $80-100k in revenue for them over 6 months. From customers who already existed.


The Bigger Problem:

Most brands set everything up backwards:
Cold traffic:
1-3% conversion rate
High CAC ($40-80+ for most D2C)
Don't know you, don't trust you

Past buyers:
20-40% ""conversion"" (getting them to buy again)
Basically free (just reminder cost)
Already know your product works
But we spend 90% of budget on cold traffic and basically ignore past customers.

Why This Happens:
It's not that people don't KNOW they should do this. It's that:

It's manual and annoying - Downloading CSVs, uploading to different platforms, doing it every week

Tools don't talk to each other - Shopify doesn't auto-sync to Facebook Ads, Klaviyo doesn't auto-update Google Ads audiences

Compliance is scary - SMS/WhatsApp have strict rules, mess it up and you get banned or sued

Not sexy - New customer acquisition sounds cooler than ""reminding people to reorder""
So it just... doesn't get done. Or gets done for 2 weeks then abandoned.

What Actually Works:
Multi-channel reorder reminders at the RIGHT time:

Email - Good but only 15-20% open rates

SMS - Better, 30-40% open rates but expensive in some markets

WhatsApp - Insane 80-90% open rates, cheaper than SMS, feels personal

Plus retargeting ads:

Facebook/Instagram Custom Audiences (show ads to people who bought 40-60 days ago)

Google Ads Customer Match (when they search related terms, you show up)

The key is doing ALL of these together, automatically, at the right time for each customer.

Timing example:
Customer bought a 45-day supply
Day 40: Light email (""How's it working out?"")
Day 45: SMS + WhatsApp (""Time to restock!"")
Day 50: Retargeting ads on FB/IG
Day 60: If still no reorder, stronger push with incentive
Day 75+: Win-back campaign
But this only works if it's AUTOMATED. If you're doing this manually, you'll quit after week 2.

The Compliance Nightmare:
If you're doing SMS/WhatsApp (which you should), you need:
For US (TCPA):
Explicit opt-in at checkout
""Reply STOP"" in every message
Can only text 8am-9pm their time zone
Keep consent records for years

For EU (GDPR):
Clear separate consent (not buried in terms)
Easy data deletion
Document everything

For WhatsApp:
Only message people who opted in
Use approved message templates
Get flagged for spam = permanent ban, no appeals

Most brands either:
Skip SMS/WhatsApp entirely (leaving money on table)
OR do it wrong and get shut down
Both suck.
Quick Reality Check:
This isn't some growth hack. It's just:
Knowing when customers probably need to reorder
Reminding them before they forget about you
Making it easy for them to buy again
Doing it automatically so it happens every day
The reason it works so well is because CAC keeps climbing (FB ads are 2x what they were 3 years ago), but your existing customers are just sitting there. Forgetting about you. Buying from competitors.

For a brand doing $100k/month:
If 65% of customers never buy again, and you improve that to just 50%? That's $15k extra per month. $180k per year.
From customers who ALREADY trusted you once.
Common Mistakes I See:
Waiting too long - Day 90 email when product runs out at day 45 = useless
Only using email - 80% of people won't see it
Treating everyone the same - Someone who bought yesterday vs 60 days ago needs different messaging
Offering discounts - Most people would've bought anyway, you just killed margin
Doing it manually - You'll stop after 2 weeks when you get busy

Who This Actually Matters For:

✅ Consumable products (supplements, skincare, pet food, coffee, etc.)
✅ Doing at least $50k/month (below that, just use basic Klaviyo)
✅ Repeat purchase rate under 50%
✅ CAC is climbing and margins are getting squeezed
❌ One-time purchases (furniture, electronics)
❌ Really small brands (focus on product-market fit first)
❌ Low quality products (retention can't fix a bad product)

My Actual Question:
How many of you are actively working on retention vs just burning money on cold traffic?
And if you're NOT working on it - what's the blocker? Time? Tech complexity? Just not a priority?

Also curious - anyone using WhatsApp for reorder reminders? We've seen it absolutely demolish email/SMS in terms of response rates, but barely anyone talks about it.

Since people usually ask:

""Can't I just do this with Klaviyo?""
You can do email automation with Klaviyo. But:
No SMS (need separate tool)
No WhatsApp (need separate tool + API access)
Can't auto-sync audiences to Facebook/Google Ads
Basic segmentation only
No attribution tracking (which channel actually drove the reorder?)
Klaviyo is great for starting. At scale, you need more.

""What about Zapier/Make?""

They work until you hit volume. Then:
Rate limits (100k operations/month = $299/month)
Slow (2-5 second delays add up)
Break easily (one API change = everything stops)
Can't do complex logic
For small brands, sure. For anything serious, you need proper infrastructure.

""How do I know if this would work for me?""

Check your repeat purchase rate. If it's under 40% and you sell consumables, there's money on the table.
Calculate: If 10% more customers reordered, what's that worth? Usually 5-10x more than the cost of building the system.

TL;DR:
Stop obsessing over new customer acquisition when 60-70% of your existing customers are ghosting you. They'd probably buy again if you just reminded them at the right time, across the right channels, with the right message. Automate this properly and it's basically free money.

What bothers me is Uber is basically washing their hands and saying that there will be no cleanup fees or damage fees or any potential mishap.

Or some sort of container to transport them. I won’t picked up a rider with a Yorkie, while the dog was purely friendly, cute, he immediately humped into the driver seat and almost licked my coffee cup, and he left hair all over the driver seat.

I really would love to though, and even my therapist think that I would benefit a lot from ADHD testing. I guess my reasoning is more financial at the moment. 

Anyway, I am 23 (F) in college and it is getting harder to focus on tasks and daydream all day. I have a long history of daydreaming ever since I was a kid, which I just thought was a very normal thing for everyone. Recently, one of my friends who has been diagnosed with ADHD told me that I could try studying with adderall and it might improve my focus.

And so I did. I was told not take more than 15 mg as a first time because it could increase my heart rate. However, after 2 hours of taking it, I didn’t feel anything particularly different, so I took the other half. An hour later I still didn’t feel anything. I did noticed that I was a bit anxious and fidgety, but I’m always like that with caffeine too.

I drink coffee and energy drinks regularly, so I am unsure if that might be the cause of not feeling much from 30 mg, or if there might be other underlying factors. 

I am aware that this is probably something I won’t be able to know until I get proper testing, but I was just curious to see if there might be other people who can relate to this, and hear about it. ",1,1761666115.0,adhdwomen,3,0.67,False

**Are you open to refurbs/used?**

Used/refurbished is fine

Very. Want to easily put this in a backpack to take to a coffee shop, or have it sit on my lap on the couch without it being unwildly.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? **

NA, 13-15 in though

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

Unity/Godot/Asprite (light, 2d game development use), hobby photographer, but have PC for bulk and big projects. and general web use.

Light gaming, but honestly would probably stream from PC.

I want to enjoy using it :D

I like a fairly potent cup and use what many would consider WAY too much coffee and hit it with hot water. Anyways, here's my go-to for the full-size Aeropress:

* Amount: 20g
* I dilute with some water to make an ""Aeropress-acano"" 
* Roast: medium-light
* Grind: #4 on my $100 OXO electric grinder

This works well for me. When I travel or go to the office, I usually switch to an Aeropress Go and pre-grind/measure my coffee.

Now, I want to make the jump to a hand grinder. Here's what I need/don't need:

* Budget: not budget, but not top-of-the-line
* Adjustment: I will want this to get dialed in for my Aeropress and literally never change the setting
* Cleaning: tool-free disassembly/cleaning would be GREAT
* Coffee amount: I'd still like to be able to grind 20g of light roast and be able to use it for my Go and my full-size (I also have an XL, but I'm not really interested in a single hopper that can do 40g)

I'm seeing the Timemore C2 and C3, as well as the 1zpresso Q (would maybe consider the X, but when we're getting to the K, I'm not sure I need to sink $200 into this).

I got into the hobby that is pourovers and specialty coffee in 2019, after recovering from BAS (Brewer Acquisition Syndrome) I've found my taste preference and a brewer that fits my needs.

Enter the April Brewer: What makes it my ideal brewer? Consistency, Smooth brain variables. You can tell from the first pour if it's going to be a fast or slower draw down. Drawdown too fast? Pour higher, slow drawdown? Pour lower. After my first cup from a new bag I have a good idea of the best pouring structure for that coffee, going auto pilot. I don't wanna fuss too much first thing in the morning before work, I'm barely functioning at 0500 the simplicity of two pours works best for me.


TLDR: Simple and consistent method, preferred taste profile.

The new porch ties seamlessly into the home’s original architecture—updated windows, a timeless color palette, and a welcoming blue door make the whole exterior feel refreshed and in tune with the neighborhood. Inside, natural light and warm finishes make it the perfect spot for morning coffee in March or reading on a crisp October afternoon.

For many older Twin Cities homes, upgrading the porch does more than add square footage—it creates a year-round connection to the outdoors and can significantly improve resale appeal. It’s a small footprint with a big impact.

After chatting on discord for a bit less than 2 weeks (this time I also was away for work a few days), I asked if she would be interested in meeting up and she suggested a a café.

We did meet up, I brought her some homemade cookies and we talked for around 4 hours, getting breakfast / coffee and then taking a walk through the town. At the end we kinda awkwardly (I think we were both kinda unsure how to say goodby) said goodby and I offered a goodby hug, which she accepted. Other than that, we had no body contact. I personally find it disrespectful to touch someone else without consent, so obviously I wouldn't randomly touch her. 

I definitely had fun in all our interactions so far and we seemed to agree on almost all (especially the important) topics. I also assume (although I admit that I didn't explicitly ask) that she enjoyed it, otherwise we wouldn't have met and we wouldn't still be chatting. But somehow I feel like I'm in a weird spot right now. I do definitely like her in general and I could imagine this being / becoming either romantic or platonic. My problem is that I have a bit of trouble differentiating between the two and some kind of friendship is pretty much mandatory for me to have any kind of more explicit romantic feelings / attraction. At the same time, I need some form of reciprocation or confirmation. I literally can't feel any deeper romantic feelings for someone who doesn't feel similar for me. At the same time, I would lie if I said that I didn't have at least a tiny bit of concern that she could lose interest, at least in the romantic route. And I am well aware that this is a problem on my side, I would never blame someone else for that. 

While I feel like it's mostly in my mind, this creates kind of a deadlock. I am rather sure that we do like each other in some form and we would both be okay with being platonic friends. On the other hand, we did meet on a dating app, both ""looking for a long term partner"" and I personally would be open to exploring a more romantic path, if I knew that this was what \*she wanted\* as well. 

The solution is of course, to talk about my feeling and ask her how she feels. Even though we already briefly talked about the Aro / Ace spectrum, this is still something that is really hard for me to talk about for some reason and I have trouble articulating myself. And even if we talk about it, I am unsure how to then progress from there. I do want to meet her again but I honestly am a bit afraid that I might unintentionally navigate into a purely platonic direction. I feel like right now I could enjoy something like holding hands or even cuddling and see how it feels. But thinking about initiating even just that makes me cringe a bit. I would definitely ask for consent but that opens up to rejection, (thanks RSD). And stuff like the slightly cringy ""stretch arms and then place behind back"" makes me feel like I'm sexually assaulting someone lol. If I were to put my arm around someone and that makes them uncomfortable, but I fail to notice that, it would be devastating. I don't want to hurt / make someone uncomfortable in that way. So if we met again, or even a few times, without either of us initiating any form of intimacy (and I'm talking about for example simply holding hands, not straight up sex), it defaults to platonic. 

If anyone has been in a similar spot or wants to share their own experience with relationships, or words wisdom, I'd appreciate it. Or if you have been on the other side of this, how would you want to be approached with this. I am not aware of her being neurodivergent but I feel like folks around here have better takes than most other online spaces. I'd also take ""date"" suggestions other than coffee / dinner :)",3,1761665057.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, ""that man with the bandages, what happened to him?"" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, ""He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us."" I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

The Los Angeles Dodgers are the clear favorite here, with moneyline odds hovering around **-120 to -130** (decimal: \~1.46). That translates to an implied probability of **\~69% to win**, while the Toronto Blue Jays sit at **+275 to +280** (\~27% implied probability). The spread is a tight **Dodgers -1.5 (-110)**, and the total runs line is **8.5**, with even money on Over/Under.

But here’s the kicker: The Blue Jays’ starter, Shane Bieber, has a **4.38 ERA and 1.54 WHIP in three postseason starts**, and their bullpen has thrown **76 outs in four games**—like asking a group of overworked interns to run a marathon. Meanwhile, the Dodgers’ lineup is a wrecking crew against right-handed pitching (second in wOBA, third in ISO this postseason), and they’ve got **Freddie Freeman** (2 RBI in Game 3), **Will Smith** (.293/.367/.521 in the playoffs), and a resurgent **Mookie Betts** (4-for-30 slump? What’s a slump?) ready to feast on Bieber.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Dodger Streaks

* **Toronto’s woes**: Bieber is a solid starter, but his postseason numbers are shaky. The Blue Jays’ bullpen, meanwhile, is like a group of firefighters who’ve been dousing blazes for weeks—**exhausted, error-prone, and begging for a coffee break**.
* **Dodgers’ strengths**: Their lineup is a **statistical nightmare** for right-handed pitchers. Freeman’s already got a two-RBI game in this series, and Smith’s cleanup bat is a .293 postseason hitter with six RBIs. Oh, and Betts? He’s due for a breakout after a 4-for-30 NLCS slump—\*statistically, he’s due to hit a home run into

1oic3ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingMallorca/comments/1oic3ig/first_time_visitors_our_experience_and_recs/,First Time Visitors - Our Experience and Recs!,"Hi all, 

My wife and I were first time visitors to the island and just got back from a 4 day stay in Palma. This sub really helped us plan our trip so just wanted to give back and share our experience and some of our recommendations! 

**Hotel:** 

We stayed at Posada Terra Santa and could not have been happier. Between the room itself, location, customer service - everything was top notch. We payed an average of $350/night (USD) including taxes and fees via [Hotels.com](http://Hotels.com) and for us, it was worth every penny. If you are planning on getting a rental car, they do have a garage located very very close to the property, just on the other side of the square (maybe a 2 minute walk). Parking was $24/night. 

**Rental Car:** 

I would definitely recommend a rental car for getting around the island. You won't need it at all in Palma, but to get to the beaches and other towns, you will. We used Moov and were very happy. Pickup and drop off were super easy, no fuss, and you get to bypass any rental car counters at the airport. You fill out all the information online beforehand, then they bring the car right to you in the parking lot and you sign the contract right there. We did the Red Pack for full coverage and unlimited miles. One thing to note is that the Red Pack does require you to fill the car up before returning. Weirdly, the Blue Pack, the lowest tier, allows you to return the car empty, but the deductible for any damage is much higher. To drop off, you just park it in the garage and leave the keys and parking ticket in the glovebox and send them a message. No need to wait for anyone. This was super helpful as we had an early flight out and didn't want to get to the airport any earlier than absolutely necessary. 

**Restaurants:** 

Here are some of the restaurants in Palma that we ate at that we would recommend. Most of these recs came from the front desk staff at Posada Terra Santa and she did not miss. 

\- Bar Dia: Awesome no frills tapas bar with amazing traditional Spanish tapas. Not a fancy place by any means, but the food quality was among the best we had. Get the Gambas.

\- La Rosa Vermuteria & Colmado: Nice vermouth bar with a bit of a more modern take on tapas. Physically, a nicer place to eat at than Bar Dia and food was pretty on par. Their olives are amazing, as is the pork belly and gambas. 

\- La Bodeguilla: A nicer restaurant that has a lot of different wines you can try by the glass, which not every place offers. Whatever you do, you must try the Grilled Iberian Pork Shoulder and the croquettes. 

\- La Despensa del Barón: The restaurant in the lobby of Posada Terra Santa, I would consider this to be a bit of a hidden gem as it didn't come up in any lists we looked at, but it definitely should. 

\- Fika Farina Coffee & Bakery: Coffee is good but really you come here for the cardamom buns and the fresh raspberry danishes. Unreal. 

\- Ca'n Joan de s'Aigo: Sit down and get an Ensaimada or two and a cortado in the morning. We did a regular and a crema y manzana. 

**Experiences:** 

We spent a couple of days in Palma, a day at the beaches, and a day exploring a few of the towns on the western side of the island: Valldemossa, Soller/Port de Soller, and Deia. 

**Palma:** 

Honestly, I could have spent many more days just wandering around the beautiful streets of Palma. There are so many little shops and boutiques to pop into, and then the Cathedral, the Royal Palace of Almudaina, Museum of Mallorca, etc.

**Beaches:** 

Cala Pi: There's a beautiful outlook at the Torre de Cala Pi, which is also where I would recommend parking. It's free and only a short walk to the entrance of the Platja de Cala Pi. The beach itself here was meh. It's pretty small and the sand isn't very soft, but nice enough to spend a couple hours. 

Cala Mondrago: Now this is a proper beach. If you are driving, I would recommend putting Parc Natural de Mondrago into your GPS and be sure to pay attention to the road signs as ours tried to take us down a private, no access road when we just routed to the beach. There's a small parking lot there that costs €6 for the day, then a short 10 minute walk down to the beach. 

**Valldemossa, Soller, Port de Soller, and Deia:** 

We started in Valldemossa, then hit Soller, then had dinner at Restaurante Miró in Deia. I can tell you right off the bat that I wish we had spent more time in Valldemossa and would have happily skipped the Port de Soller. 

**Valldemossa:** 

Beautiful town - small enough to feel small, but large enough to keep yourself occupied for several hours. There's a Chopin museum at the monastery where he spent some time. We probably would have gone if we had more time, but even if you don't, just walking around the streets is great. 

**Soller and Port de Soller:** 

For us, Soller was worth the stop, Port de Soller not so much. To be fair, we sort of did it incorrectly - we actually drove into Port de Soller and parked there. What we should have done was park in Soller (there are 2 parking lots off the main road, but learn from our mistakes and drive into the actual city center where there are other lots much closer to where you want to be!), then take the tram into Port de Soller and back. Port de Soller itself wasn't much for us. Very touristy and not that interesting. Soller itself was more worth it. There's a pretty church in the Plaça de la Constitució, which is like the main square in the old town.

**Deia:** 

We didn't actually spend much time walking around Deia as we just made it there for a 6:30p dinner at Restaurante Miró, which is at La Residencia and is the sister restaurant to the Michelin star El Olivo. We had read that it is a great place for sunset, which is probably true at certain times of the year, but when we went, the sun dipped down below the mountains around 6:00p (official sunset time that day was like 6:50p). If I could do it again, I would probably have gotten there much earlier to actually watch the sun go down. I suspect that other parts of the year, the sun actually sets closer to where you can see the water. Either way, it was a gorgeous view and the restaurant has a beautiful terrace to look out over the valley and still a great place for sunset. 

And that was our trip! All in all a wonderful experience and a place we would definitely return to. Everyone we encountered on the island was super friendly and most spoke a good amount of English. I could happily spend a week plus here as we didn't even get to touch the north eastern part of the island. Hopefully we'll get to come back someday. 

This ended up being a lot longer than I had planned, so if you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I hope it's somewhat helpful! ",3,1761664509.0,VisitingMallorca,4,1.0,False

So before i got pregnant i was doing some testing because i've had heartrate issues for a couple years. An incident now 3-4 years ago, I was doing a short walk on an incline and my heart rate spiked at 193bpm, and I almost fainted, took 20 minutes to come back down. Mentioned to my Family doc, got sent to cardiologist, ultra sound and 3 day ecg and stress test found nothing wrong... Was told to cut back on coffee, quit smoking and exercise more and my heart rate will fix itself. 

Fast forward, my hubby and I conceived April of this year, currently 28 weeks pregnant with our baby boy. I quit smoking the day I found out i was pregnant. I also only have 1, 6 or 8oz coffee in the AM.   
I've been noticing that walking is getting harder and harder (parking to my office) , so I decided to check my heartrate monitor on my apple watch, and it seems i'm still having some crazy fluctuations.. Some days walking my heart rate jumps to 180bpm. 

I think it's POTS or a type of Dysautonomia.. but diagnosis is slow and I put on the back burner when i got pregnant. 

Is there anyone who has POTS that is also pregnant? What did your OB say/do to help you?   
Is there anyone who was diagnosed while pregnant?   
How worried should I be?

I work in a small office, just the two of us. I actually like my job, but my coworker is making things really hard. She gets upset over tiny things – towels, coffee, water left in the kettle – and often comments in a way that feels condescending or even personal.

Some time ago, she even said something very personal and completely inappropriate about a painful experience I’ve had. That really hurt, and since then I’ve tried to stay professional and calm.

I still try to help her when she’s struggling because I don’t want a bad atmosphere at work. A few days ago, I even brought cake to lighten the mood and be nice. She ignored it completely.
When I told her that she could just let me know directly if something bothers her, she replied,

“I’m not your mother. And she should have learn such things. And this says a lot about your hygiene.""


It felt so unnecessarily mean and disrespectful that I didn’t even know how to respond.

No matter what I do – being kind, staying quiet, helping out – it’s never right. We share the same small office all day, so there’s no real way to get distance or space to breathe.

I know I can’t change her behavior, but I find it hard to stop thinking about it after work.

Hey, fellow entrepreneurs!

Tired of feeling like you need a marketing degree (and a massive budget) to see real results from your online advertising? You're not alone! Many small business owners in the US struggle to make their ad dollars count. The good news? You can get started driving traffic and sales with as little as $5 a day. Let’s dive into some simple Facebook ad strategies that won't break the bank.

**The Challenge:**

Getting noticed online can feel like shouting into a hurricane. Paid advertising seems like the only answer, but the costs can quickly spiral. Many small businesses face the same hurdles: Limited budgets, fear of wasting money on ineffective ads, and not knowing where to even begin with Facebook's complex Ads Manager. You’re likely juggling multiple roles, from CEO to janitor, and simply don't have the time to become a Facebook ads expert. But don’t worry, you don’t have to be!

**Level Up Your Leads: $5 Facebook Ad Domination**

Alright, let's get practical. We're focusing on maximizing your impact with a minimal daily spend. The key is targeted precision and compelling content. Forget broad campaigns; we're going laser-focused.

*   **Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer (Seriously!)** This is crucial. Don't just say ""people who like my product."" Get granular. Age, location (down to the zip code if possible!), interests, job titles, even their favorite TV shows. Facebook's Audience Insights tool (available within Ads Manager) can help you uncover these hidden gems.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Use free customer surveys (Google Forms is your friend!) to gather demographic and interest data directly from your existing customers.
*   **Step 2: Hyper-Local Targeting (Especially for Local Businesses)** If you're a brick-and-mortar store, restaurant, or service provider, targeting a small radius around your location is essential. Think 1-5 miles to start. This ensures your ads reach people who can actually visit your business.
    *   **Example:** If you own a coffee shop in Austin, Texas, target people within a 3-mile radius interested in ""coffee,"" ""local cafes,"" and ""breakfast.""
*   **Step 3: Craft Compelling, Relevant Ad Copy and Visuals.** Ditch the generic stock photos. Use high-quality images or short videos showcasing your product or service in action. Your ad copy should be concise, benefit-driven, and include a clear call to action (e.g., ""Visit our website,"" ""Claim your discount,"" ""Learn More"").
    *   **Example:** For that Austin coffee shop: A short video of a barista creating a latte art, with text overlay: ""Start your day right! Get 10% off your first latte. Show this ad to redeem!""
    *   **Common Pitfall:** Avoid using too much text in your images, as Facebook penalizes ad reach for images overloaded with text.
*   **Step 4: A/B Test EVERYTHING!** Run multiple ad variations with different headlines, images, and calls to action. Even small tweaks can significantly impact performance. Facebook's Ads Manager allows you to easily split test your ads and see which ones are performing best.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Start with 2-3 ad variations and monitor their performance closely for the first few days. Pause the underperforming ads and allocate the budget to the winners.
*   **Step 5: Monitor and Optimize (Daily!).** Don't just set it and forget it. Check your ad performance daily. Analyze metrics like click-through rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), and conversion rate. Identify what's working and what's not, and make adjustments accordingly.
*   **Step 6: Leverage Lookalike Audiences (Once You Have Some Data)** After you have at least 100 customers, you can create a ""lookalike audience"" based on their characteristics. This tells Facebook to find other people who are similar to your existing customers, significantly expanding your reach while maintaining relevance.

**Free/Low-Cost Resources Mentioned:**

*   **Facebook Audience Insights:** Free tool within Facebook Ads Manager to research potential customers' interests, demographics, and behaviors. It's invaluable for defining your target audience.
*   **Canva (Free Plan):** A user-friendly graphic design platform that allows you to create professional-looking ad visuals without needing any design skills.
*   **Google Forms:** A free tool for creating surveys to collect data directly from your customers, informing your target audience and ad copy.

**Conclusion:**

Turning $5 into customers on Facebook might seem impossible, but with a strategic approach, targeted campaigns, and continuous optimization, it's absolutely achievable.

She’s about 10 years older than me and grew up down the street. The family moved many states away 3 decades ago but she moved back around 15 years ago to save herself. When she returned she lived with my sister and her husband. She settled in nicely, dated some men and eventually married the love of her life. We were all so happy and thrilled for her. In that time, she became more of a sister to me. My family always understood why she came back, in fact my parents encouraged it for years. We knew her life would be better with our love and support. She was treated like the 4th child in my family. From my perspective, we’ve only given her love (not so much by her immediate family).

She and her husband would be the first I’d greet at parties. I always looked forward to her hugs and kind words. She became my favorite family member - I adored Danielle and Joe.

Then it all stopped. She stopped coming to events and reaching out. Her consistency with birthday notes and gifts was always spot on and then it stopped. I assume it has to do with my Aunt and social media. Her posts are over the top and totally guilt trip ridden. I don’t blame her for going non contact with them… essentially my family has too. I thought she knew we’d support her. Perhaps it’s too hard.

I miss her. She lives 30 miles from me and I could really use one of her hugs. I want to look in her eyes and for her to understand what she means to me.  I know she struggles with her mental health, I do too. How do I tell her I miss her without making her feel bad? How do I ask to see her without making it worse.

We were both headed to a coffee tour, two strangers sharing a ride and a quiet sense of curiosity. She was from Oaxaca, Mexico — confident, warm, and so easy to talk to.

After the tour, we decided to keep the day going and took a horseback ride through the mountains. The air was cool and smelled of coffee trees and rain. We rode along narrow trails overlooking the valleys, laughing and talking like old friends. By the time we returned, the sun was beginning to fade behind the hills — and I knew I didn’t want the day to end.

I asked if she’d like to grab a drink that evening, and her smile said everything before her words did. That night felt timeless — the kind of night that belongs more to memory than to time itself. She told me about her culture, the colors and spirit of Día de los Muertos, and her life as an engineer. Her English flowed effortlessly, her laughter filling every pause.

When the sky began to darken, I offered to walk her home. Rain gathered in the air, soft and electric. As we walked, I learned more about her — her quiet confidence, her curiosity about the world. Then the first drops began to fall. I gently took her arm and led her under the small awning of a closed shop. The street shimmered in the light rain as I ordered her an Uber. She stood close beside me, her eyes catching the glow of the passing cars.

When the car arrived, we slid into the back seat, still talking softly. She sat close, her voice low and steady, and I couldn’t help but steal glances at her — wishing the ride, and the night, could last just a little longer.

She flew out the next morning, but that brief encounter — two travelers from different worlds crossing paths in the Andes — stayed with me. Maybe it was the beauty of the city, the lack of sleep, or something I can’t quite explain… but a part of me wonders if I might have met the love of my life that night. I hope our paths cross again someday.

I had invited her for a coffee/study session together but she was at the conference and eventually she ends up inviting me to go out dancing one night and says she would love for me to join her. We go out dancing as our first hangout and got to know each other more. I had a strong frame that night and before it was time for her to leave my car, she tells me she wants to make out. We make out and one thing leads the other. After our session, we stayed up til 6am in my car talking about life, and her sharing mostly about her past relationships. She tells me her last relationship was in May but didn't workout due to long distance and that the most recent time she had sex was with a guy friend she knew for 1 year before they started to hook up. Apparently they've hooked up at school multiple times and she told me that she's not emotionally attached to him and that it's only physical.. She told me how the person disappointed her by yelling at her one day for some reason and that she doesn't want to talk to him anymore and how he doesn't want to commit to something real. She even asked me at one point for advice on how to detach from someone.. I tend to have a good read on people at the beginning and besides that red flag, she's had good signs/traits I've been searching for in a woman up until the plot twist this story has at the end. I'm 30 yrs old and she's 24 yrs old. We're both on our career journeys.

We've only been talking for about two weeks but we have spent
hours talking late at night in my car. We basically shared a lot about
ourselves.

Our times we've hung out: Met 3 weeks ago at library, Oct 6th

1.	⁠1st date, went dancing & hooked up Oct 16th - (stayed up talking till 6am  after we hooked up)

2.	⁠Studied together, Oct 18th - (almost all day until 12am then talked in car until 3am)

3.	⁠Studied together, Oct 19th - (almost all day until  12am then talked in car until 3am)

4.	⁠Studied together, Oct 20th (for about 2.5 hrs)

5.	⁠Studied together, invited her to gym with me - Oct 22nd - (1:30pm - 11:30pm)

6.	⁠""2nd real date"", Pumpkin Patch, Oct 25th  (1pm -  5:30pm)

7.	⁠An intentional late night link up, in her car this time Oct 26th (12:30am - 7am)

To make this story short, the day after the Pumpkin Patch, which was Sunday October 26th. I called her around 11am (wish I didn't bc the phone call lasted 50 min and we've never talked for that long plus I feel like it showed too much availability from me 1st thing in the am). She told me she was going to call me that night. (We talked about hooking up that night).

She calls me Sunday night and we decided to meet up and eventually hook up. This was our 2nd time hooking up and my 2nd time making out with her. When I would kiss her, I felt something I hadn't felt with anyone else in a very long time. For a sec I thought what if she's ""the one"" (since I'm dating with intention.) The continuous hangouts, personal long talks, really thought she was girlfriend material overall. She's family oriented and would ALWAYS leave her phone at the table faced up every time she would go use the restroom. She had shown genuine interest, was always transparent without me even asking, and reliable when I would call her. Mind you, we wouldn't text much these past couple of weeks it was more of like I would call her or she would call me to set things up. She even invited me to a couple of family things. One was to stop and say hi while she and her family pass out candy during Halloween. The other was to a relatives birthday party this past Saturday. (I couldn't make it)

In conclusion, after we hooked up we laid in the back seats of her SUV cuddling and being very affectionate towards each other, talking, kissing, even talked about a road-trip in her SUV sometime. I had to tell her again that I had to get going. Suddenly I found a condom wrapper in her backseat that wasn't mine. I nonchalant pointed it out and say that's awkward. I then step out to my car and then she steps out and we start talking. She always struck me as an honest person and says it was from 3-4 weeks ago with that guy she told me about. I told her to tell me when the last time she had sex with someone else and that's when she would say it was. I'm not good at lying and I feel like she's one of those ppl too. The eyes don't lie and I told her to tell me that even if it was last week it's not like we were exclusive. It didn't take much to have her admit it (like other girls in my past). She sighed and admitted that it was that same day in the morning after our phone call with the same guy she had told me about being FWB with. She said the condom wrapper was from 3-4 weeks ago but that she did hook up with the guy earlier that day. I asked her how come she didn't agree to hanging out with me another day instead like I suggested on the phone, she said she wanted to see me. She said she shouldn't have done that and that she was really sorry for what she did and for hurting me. She looked remorseful and teared up and said that she was trying to decompress ""us"" bc she wasn't sure of me if I was wanting something serious with her. She asked me how she can gain my trust back and that she would do anything to prove to me that when's she's in a committed relationship or when exclusivity is established that she doesn't sleep with anyone else. (She's mentioned this before) She said to give her a month to let her prove to me with her actions how loyal she can be. I was definitely hurt about it and expressed the betrayal to her but I was still very calm overall. I feel like most people would have left in a heartbeat but idk why I was still there? I eventually made attempts to leave but for 2 hours she was trying to get me to stay and hear her out. She said she doesn't want to loose the opportunity of loosing what we could have potentially been together. Today (Monday 27th she sends me a long text message but I haven't responded).

The single shot filter is too small for 12 grams of coffee even when grinded much finer than I would use for a normal espresso (1/2 ratio). In turn the double shot filter is too big for 12 grams and I end up with a soggy puck. Going finer resulted in even soggier pucks. It's also a bit bitter rather than smooth.

I’ve lost a significant amount of weight in spring due to undereating, and then went back to eating normally.

It wasn’t bad, I’ve been a binge eater for years, but now I turned extremely paranoid because I was terrified to gain the weight back.

However, the schoolyear started, and this keeps happening almost every other day, like around 3-4 times a week.

I just quit my job at a coffee shop chain today because I couldn’t take the rats anymore. 

Do you think they were violating labor/ health and safety laws?

Last week I saw two live rats when working the closing shift alone and reported it to my bosses. They told me that they would call pest control to fix the issue. However, my coworkers and I continued to smell rat and find a few dead rats over the next couple of days. 

Today, I was working the closing shift again and the smell was worse than ever. The stench was coming from under the espresso bar, behind the fridges that are bolted to the ground. So all shift I was pushing through nausea while working, making coffees while breathing in rotting rat air. After a few hours the smell was getting to be too much so I went outside to get fresh air for a few minutes. I was light headed and at risk of vomiting on a customer. When I came back inside and walked behind the counter I saw a huge rat out in the open. The rat was so big it had its foot stuck in a glue trap and was just towing the thing behind it with no problem. I jumped in fear and the rat ran back behind the fridge to safety. 

I called the district manager and told him I needed help and that the conditions were making me uncomfortable to work. He told me he would come to my location to help. I continued to serve customers, stomping my feet with everything I did as to keep the rat from coming back out. After a hour, he showed up and this point I was shaking from anxiety and actively fighting the urge to puke. I asked if I could leave and he said no. I had tears in my eyes as I told him I couldn’t work under these conditions. My asthma was getting triggered and I was out of breath just from talking to him. He said he would watch the store while I went outside for air and that they would be sending people to move the fridge ‘soon’ (as in not today). He said they had nobody else to close and I could not leave. So I quit, leaving him there to deal with it. 

I actually liked working here until this point and don’t know if I am overreacting. I’m from nyc and I’m used to rats out in the city, but having them run by my feet while I serve food and beverages was just disgusting and scary. ",1,1761662880.0,legaladvice,3,1.0,False

Took her out at like 8:30 pm (she didn't poop) and went to bed around 10 

Woke up at 3:45 this morning to go to the bathroom and the house reeked. I come out into the livingroom and there's ***More poop***  on the only part of the rug she didn't mess on Sunday
 So I took her outside to finish her business, came upstairs  spent an hour scrubbing & using our mini carpet cleaner attachment (my aunt will be bring a full sized carpet cleaner later today) 
Then I washed up, went to the gym and did a full body work out. Followed by a brisk 10 minute walk to Walmart to get creamer because I forgot to go yesterday.

There’s no clear reason for this, as I haven’t thought about him in a long time. He did reach out to me about a month or so ago to have coffee as friends. I declined as i do not want to be friends with him (toxic relationship towards the end, important relationship for me as we were together for some years and living together for the most part of it). We parted ways a long time ago, and i do not have romantic feelings for him any longer.
What is weird is that when he reached out, he did not appear in my dreams at all.

It makes me wonder if something energetic or emotional might be reflected in my chart.
I have no desire to reach out or reconnect with him, but perhaps these dreams are surfacing because I’m feeling lonely or craving emotional intimacy (not necessarily physical).

So, I did that the next day because 10mg did absolutely nothing for me. I’ve noticed some symptoms with 20mg — like a lack of “food noise” (which, for me personally, is a bonus because part of my ADHD involves constantly seeking dopamine from food) — and a slightly faster heartbeat.

But it’s done nothing for my focus so far. Is my dose too low? Or is it just not the right med? . I tried taking it with food and without and it makes no difference in helpfulness either way.

I’ve really had no negative side effects other than the heartbeat thing, but it’s not bothersome. I have anxiety and drink coffee, so I’m used to the sensation at this point lol.

I was really hoping for an improvement in my focus because I have inattentive type ADHD and HORRIBLE executive dysfunction and procrastination and recently I started college and it has been hell.

1oibakv,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1oibakv/my_situation_advice_welcome/,My Situation.... (Advice welcome!!),"Hey All,

29/M here... In the summer I was drinking a lot of Cold Brew Coffee. It was wrecking havoc on my GI, causing me to have loose stools, thin stools, and nonstop gas. I took 2 FOB tests that i got off Amazon ON DIFFERENT DAYS, and they came back with a slightly positive line. In my mind, there is no way that my stomach issues would cause a positive result. Worst case scenario incoming.

  
\*QUEUE PANIC\*

  
I immediately self diagnosed myself with CC, and frantically tried to get in with my local GI Dr. The wait was about 5 weeks to get in. 

  
While i was waiting, i figured I would cut out the Cold Brew Coffee, and just go with regular coffee. Boom. Stools became thick and relatively normal again. I still get ""the runs"" occasionally from caffeine, but thats because of my IBS. I also get the same after too much dairy, alcohol, and a few other things. 

  
I got in to my Dr and told him about the issue, but he is telling me that because of the positive FOB test that i got, he needs to do a colonoscopy, because ""IBS and GI Irritation from the cold brew coffee would not cause the FOB Test to turn positive"" (which i am hearing the opposite about online.. and that it WOULD cause there to be occult blood). My father also had polyps in his early 30's which is another reason he wants me to get one done to rule anything out, 

  
I decided to take another FOB test yesterday, and that one actually came out NEGATIVE... so i am a little confused.

Either way, i now have a Colonoscopy schedule for Friday the 7th and i am pretty scared to put it mildly. I have generalized anxiety and Moderate ADHD, which is causing me to spiral 24/7 at a Million MPH about fear of Anesthesia, fear of the prep, being out of control.. the results... etc.

1oib9pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1oib9pb/starbucks_bakery_history/,Starbucks Bakery History,"I worked at Starbucks about 15 years ago, and I remember fondly many of the classic pastries that were offered. This was before food was a part of the menu. I vaguely remember something around that time that caused Starbucks to change the provider of the pastry items. I'm assuming it had to do with trying to provide similar items at a cheaper cost. It seems like ever since then the pastry quality has decreased, and fewer good items being introduced/removed from the menu. The chocolate chip cookie is a prime example, I remember buying those frozen by the bag full, and they were large (similar in size to maybe a Jimmy John's cookie). Then with the new provider they dropped to maybe half the size, and half the quality, but of course keeping the same price. I still remember regulars asking about it back then, as their classic coffee cake they got every Sunday morning was never the same. 

I'm curious if any long term Starbucks employees on here remember the history, and have any first hand knowledge of that period and why the change? Was it truly to just increase the bottom line like I suspect? ",1,1761662616.0,starbucks,4,1.0,False
1oib9bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobhunting/comments/1oib9bi/a_much_more_difficult_and_frustrating_process/,A much more difficult and frustrating process than I ever imagined.,"I have been unemployed for most of this year at this point.

The last time I was actively in the job market was in Q2 2020, an extremely difficult time to find a job. I got lucky back then because a connection from a former collegue was looking for someone to do a study on a very specific theme I am closely familiar with. The study was very well received and they offered me a longer-term role.

This time I have not had any luck, at all. I am actively submitting applications, editing my CV/Resume, drafting cover letters reviewed by some people, and going out for coffee (or ""virtual"" coffees) with people that have similar interests. But nothing yet, and this is draining my energy and mood.

I did undergrad and grad school at reputable US universities, have solid track record working in the fields of economics, finance and public policy, and publications on those fields. Close to 10 years of professional experience. Former colleagues tell me that I have an extremely solid profile, even if I don't show it off in a regular conversation. But here I am, riding this struggle bus as I try to find a job.

I am curious to hear about other people’s experiences, and how you cope with this madness. Also, if you have any tips that helped you in your own job search, please consider sharing!

Long story short, I go to Coffee Times pretty regularly, and pretty often there is this smell that for lack of formality, smells exactly like vomit.  It seems to be the strongest in the back corner in the cubicle but I have been able to smell it other spots as well.

It isn't always constant.  But when it is present,  sometimes I can barely eat my food without the vomit smell seeming to permeate my food as well.

More or less, I was wondering if anyone knows what they brew/cook/make behind the counter that may cause this smell.  I am not inherently dissing CT, I enjoy coming here, but every time this happens I can't help but wonder.  Just pure curiosity at this point lol.  Thanks.",7,1761662507.0,lexington,5,1.0,False

**08/07/2025**

Had my referral session with Fedora Laroza (booked via GenderGP since I've been with them for hormones, cost 185 pounds). She was lovely and the whole thing took about 45 minutes and she asked about my life, why I need top surgery, my goals, and childhood. Very easy process and I got the referral the same day.

I booked my initial consultation with Mr Ntanos immediately (200 pounds), and I also got a free consult with Cosmedicare just in case I decided to go with them (50 pound deposit, but was paid back when I decided not to go with them).

**29/07/2025**

Had my video call consultation with Mr Ntanos and everything went smoothly. He was very professional about pictures I had uploaded for him to look at of my pre-op chest. We discussed risks and how I'd like my chest to look after my surgery. He was open to anything I wanted to do with my nipples (hearts etc) but I just wanted them to be as masc as possible which he understood.

Few days later I had a phone call consult with Mr Raine from Cosmedicare, but decided against going with him.

**01/08/2025**

I emailed Mr Ntanos to tell him that I would like to go ahead with the surgery ASAP. He replied 3 minutes later informing me that there are some dates available in October and he will reply back with a couple when he can.

He said 3-4 Oct, 6-7-8 Nov, and 14 Dec were available, and I chose 03/10/2025.

He then booked it for me and informed me the procedure will start at noon unless indicated otherwise.

I received all confirmation emails and had to fill in 2 pre-op assessment forms that took about 30 minutes to do.

**04/08/2025**

I paid the initial deposit of 4,500 pounds.

**01/09/2025**

I paid the final deposit of 4,500 pounds for a total of 9,000 for the procedure.

In this waiting time, Mr Ntanos said I can have free calls with him to discuss any worries, but I did not need to, I just emailed him and he would respond very quickly if I had anything to ask about.

**02/10/2025**

I travelled down to London with my sister and brother in law and we stayed in a local hotel for the night.

I received an email and phone call to tell us to arrive at the Cadogan Clinic at 11:30 AM, my procedure was scheduled to start at 2 PM. I was to not eat anything for 6 hours before, and only small sips of clear liquid (water, tea/coffee with no milk/sugar) up until 2 hours before my admission time. I decided to just not eat or drink anything on the day.

**03/10/2025 - SURGERY DAY - 11:30 AM**

Arrived at the clinic and checked in, no ID was required but I brought my driving licence and passport just in case. I wore a zip up jacket, t-shirt, and loose joggers. I waited in the waiting room with my sister and brother in law.

**12:30 PM**

Had been waiting an hour and someone came to see me to apologise for my wait, and the nurse was now waiting for me. My sister and brother in law left.

The nurse led me down some stairs into a small room where she took my blood pressure, temperature, weight, height. She asked if there was any possibility I was pregnant (very politely) and I said no. I had to sign something saying there was no way I was pregnant or I would have had to do a pregnancy test.

She asked me what procedure I'm in for, date of birth, name etc. She put my wrist band on and told me how to put on the compression stockings and the gown, and that I was allowed to keep on my own boxers.

She left the room while I changed.

Mr Ntanos then came in after I was done and he drew on me. The whole drawing process took about 2 minutes before he left and I put on my hair net and the grippy socks to cover my stockings. There is also a mirror in there for any pre-op pictures you want to take. I put on a gown thing to cover my back.

Another nurse came in to ask me the same questions and sign a couple more forms, I told her I was nervous about the general anaesthetic and she eased my nerves by saying it is quite pleasant and I probably won't even notice.

The anaesthetist came in and I told him my worries (worried I would have a reaction to the anaesthetic) and he said the type they use for this is very mild, he's never seen a reaction, and if he did he would be very equipped to deal with it.

I felt a lot better after this and then we walked into the operating room.

**13:00 PM**

The operating room was not big at all, about the size of a dentist's office. I was told to remove my back covering and take the gown down slightly at the front, but not off. Then I got onto the operating table myself and they put the blanket over me.

The bed was heated and very comfortable. Mr Ntanos asked if I wanted any music on and he put a song on for me to listen to to ease my nerves.

The same nurse I was telling I was nervous about the general anaesthetic spoke to me the whole time they were putting me under.

The cannula hurt a little bit, but then I felt relaxed in my face and arms, and then I don't remember anything after that. It took probably about 30 seconds from the anaesthetist saying he was putting the first bit of the anaesthetic in for me to fall asleep. The nurse also put something on my forehead to measure my brain activity.

**14:45 PM**

This is when the nurse said I woke up, but I don't actually remember being awake until about half an hour after this.

**15:15 PM**

My sister rang me and asked if I was okay but I was a bit loopy so I don't know if I said anything properly.

The nurse asked what my pain was out of 10, and I said ""I'd be pretty upset if I felt like this all the time, so probably a 6/10 but its not that bad."" So she gave me some painkillers (fentanyl).

I was then helped out of the bed and to a smaller room where the first nurse I saw came to see me. She asked me what I wanted to eat and I got an almond croissant that was so good.

I rang my mam and sister a couple of times and just lied in a bed for about an hour.

The nurse came to check on my chest and she unbuttoned the post op binder a bit for me to see my chest for the first time. She said everything looked good and adjusted the binder for me (this binder is included in the cost of the procedure).

**16:30 PM**

I think around this time I went to the toilet and then afterwards the nurse took my cannula out. This hurt quite bad and I felt a bit faint so she put a fan on me for a second. She helped me get dressed and I didn't put my tshirt back on, just the jacket.

She gave me a goody bag which had: spare compression stockings (I have to wear these for a while), spare dressings, codeine (28\*30mg tablets), paracetamol (28\*500mg tablets).

Prescription: 2\*500mg paracetamol every 4 hours, 1\*30mg codeine 4x per day (or as needed). I have only taken 3 of the codeine because that is all I have needed.

**17:00 PM**

My sister and brother in law came to the reception to pick me up, and we walked back to the hotel.

We talked for a bit and I decided to not stay another night and that we should go back home now.

**19:00 PM**

Started the drive back from London. I took 2 paracetamol and 1 codeine for the drive. I slept slightly, but I mostly just sat there a bit dazed. I had a mastectomy pillow and neck pillow so I was quite comfortable the whole time.

**01:00 AM**

Got back home.

**02:00 AM**

Finally got to sleep for the night.

**Post op**

I have had a very uneventful recovery so far (10 days post op).

I noticed a little bit of bleeding the day after my surgery on the left hand side under my armpit, but I showed Mr Ntanos and he said it was nothing to worry about (the blood was old I am pretty sure).

I have had barely any pain, just slight tenderness on the left hand side. The worst part has been the not showering, I am quite itchy from that.

No constipation issues, no nausea.

I will update this post when I get my dressings removed on 17/10/2025. I haven't seen my nipples yet which I am quite nervous about but I know there is no need to be, I am just an anxious person.

Mr Ntanos and everyone at the Cadogan Clinic were so nice. I can't put across how much of a good experience this has been, I thought I would have an awful time to be honest.

Mr Ntanos is always quick to respond, professional, and just a nice person. I can't recommend him enough.

Hope this helps someone who wants to go with him in the UK clinic.

I still think the food they were serving me was a big reason I left the hospital worse off than when I entered. Texas, USA.","By day 5 I was just eating almost everything put in front of me, whether or not it would hurt me later. I was in pain and hungry. Despite eating almost all of this, I still lost over 10 pounds during my stay. Only things I 100% avoided were the cartons of milk, coffee, and acidic citrus.

Photo 1 - Day 5 breakfast - bacon, eggs, breakfast potatoes, cream of wheat, and apples. Milk and coffee to drink. 7/10, I do love cream of wheat.

Photo 2 - Day 5 lunch - bbq chicken, Mac and cheese, broccoli, vegetable soup, and a banana. 6/10, chicken was super dry but the sauce was good. 

Photo 3 - Day 5 dinner - beef pot roast, glazed carrots, roasted potatoes, a dinner roll, a side salad, peach cobbler, and iced tea to drink. 8/10, pot roast was delicious as was the peach cobbler!

Photo 4 - Day 6 breakfast - French toast, eggs, cream of wheat, orange slices, and cottage cheese. Milk, apple juice, and coffee to drink. 5/10 only because I couldn’t have half the stuff on the tray. The French toast was good.

Photo 5 - Day 6 lunch - pulled pork sandwich, zucchini and squash, chicken soup, apple slices, and water. Other than the bun and although lightly sauced, the pulled pork, this is one of the few meals where everything in front of me was almost appropriate for my diagnosis. 8/10 wish they gave me a larger portion of the squash.

Photo 6 - Day 6 dinner - chicken enchilada casserole, black beans, cilantro rice, a side salad, a dinner roll, a sugar cookie, and iced tea to drink. 7/10 for the taste, although there is not a single redeemable reason for any of this food to have been in front of me for why I was there.

Photo 7 - Day 7 breakfast - sausage patty, eggs, pancakes, grapes, and apple juice. 9/10 the pancakes were so good. The sausage was spicy, so that bit me back but it was also really good.

Photo 8 - Day 7 lunch - pepperoni pizza, French fries, and a sugar free soda. 9/10 this was my favorite meal while I was there. Again absolutely awful that they served that, but so good.

Photo 9 - Day 7 dinner - meatloaf, mixed veggies, mashed potatoes, a side salad, chocolate chip cookie, and Gatorade to drink. 5/10 meatloaf sounded good and looked decent enough, but it was really dry. The mashed potatoes and cookie saved this meal.",22,1761662269.0,hospitalfood,6,1.0,False

I am a very experienced writer, but haven’t role played much recently, and I want to get back into it! There’s just no other way to get that custom-built, character-driven romance that still brings collaboration and surprises!

Today, my hope is to find a love story set in the beauty of autumn! Pumpkin patch dates, cute fall fashion, coffee, haunted house tours, maybe even a spooky twist with something supernatural happening to our characters! But mostly, I’m looking for the fun and fluff of a new romance, amplified by some character-driven drama. What form that takes is where we begin to collaborate!

Message me if you’re interested!

*From “MY Fantasy Life” (cred Eigenstien)*

*We are trying to track Hurricane Melissa as it hits Jamaica. It appears to be much more serious in Montego Bay than anticipated. Lolita decided not to take the day off. She said it was more important “to make causes” for the safety of the people in Jamaica through her work with the children. She is staying in touch with her parents who have many connections to Jamaica beyond what we see on the news.*

*I am going to make a quick pivot. One of my favorite parts of the day is Coffee Hour. It’s quite simple. We make urns of coffee, decaf, and hot water for tea. We put out juice and some breakfast pastries, usually from Costco. Then we talk and talk. For clients who are interested, we have a agreed-upon rotation of CNN, MSNBC, and Fox.*

*With Longhouse Elem up and running, a favorite new activity is looking through the window or sitting on the porch and watching the children. “They are getting so strong and supple!” we all note. “They are building such beautiful friendships. The teacher-student bonds seem so strong!”* 

*Yesterday we watched the children try to decide where to locate the new outdoor warming pizza oven. At dinner Lori was telling us how they were deciding. “We know that the seniors like watching us play so we didn't want the oven to block their view of the pool. We also wanted the oven to be as close as possible to our lodge so we can warm up a bit after swimming and changing."" Ultimately, they recommended building the unit in front of the lodge/changing room building which really is nothing much to look at.* 

*When I shared this logic with our clients, they were very pleased with the outcome but even more so with the consideration of the children. It seems that the kids had a meeting yesterday to discuss how to avoid skipping some classes because of the lack of time in the busy schedule. They decided to put those subjects right at the beginning of the day so they didn't get skipped. This morning we watched them listen to (we later learned) “Ode to Joy.” Lolita tells us she is borrowing from Sukhomlynsky’s methodology of playing the same piece of classical music on multiple days until it becomes a part of children's souls.*

*They then went into the second subject, Community Service. They broke into their three groups: Daycare, Dee’s Kitchen, and Landscaping. Surprise! There was now a fourth group. Six kids marched into the Rec Room and sat with the seniors “to chat.” It was really lovely watching natural “getting to know you” conversations. One of our seniors plays guitar and she promised to sing for the children tomorrow. They offered to bring the seniors more snacks and then clean up. It was  a very precious moment and we all wished it could have lasted longer!*

I watched and reflected and learned. [Buddhism Teaches How to Live as a Human Being](https://app.worldtribune.org/buddhism-teaches-how-to-live-as-a-human-being/content.html) is a reprint of a speech Daisaku Ikeda gave in February 1991. It was given in the midst of [the lead up](https://share.google/yHm0TCQa4ujVCOb2B) to the November 28, 1991 [excommunication](https://share.google/LQ6VZ7N5zOli36SSW).

True and Bob have told us that 1990 and 1991 was a time of great confusion for the members and this included them. It had been their custom to make the big trip to New York City for New Year’s. When they got to the temple there were signs everywhere, even the bathrooms, that Daisaku Ikeda was a great slanderer. The priest  did not provide for the typical sake toast after Gongyo. Instead, he glared at the audience, barely nodded (a bow of disrespect), and simply walked back to his residence. 

In the middle of this confusion, Dr. Ikeda again and again explored the essence of Nichiren’s teaching. Here he lectures with this intent on “The Three Kinds of Treasure”:

>The heart of the Buddha’s lifetime of teachings is the Lotus Sutra, and the heart of the practice of the Lotus Sutra is found in the “[Bodhisattva] Never Disparaging” chapter. What does Bodhisattva Never Disparaging’s profound respect for people signify? The purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha, the lord of teachings, lies in his behavior as a human being (WND-1, p. 852)

Dr. Ikeda explains:

>In this letter, the Daishonin expresses heartfelt concern for the welfare of [Shijo Kingo], whom he knew to be hot-tempered, and urges him to exercise all the more self-control and act with caution. 

>This is an example of the Daishonin’s warm and encompassing spirit to embrace everyone and do absolutely everything he could to help them become happy. There is nothing authoritarian in his words. 

How am I doing on this scale of “my behavior as a human being”? I know I work hard at being a good mother, partner, worker, and student. There are two facets to Dissociative Disorder and I am diagnosed with both of them: Derealization and Depersonalization. Basically, it is very difficult for me to be present in a situation and to feel anything beyond play-acting. So even when I am working hard, there's dissociation. 

But I keep trying, faking it to making it. Sometimes I overcompensate and, I know, I then come across as disingenuous. I don't care. The best cure to disengagement is to engage and re-engage.

>Buddhism is ultimately a teaching about human life and conduct. In that sense, our Buddhist practice is expressed in our words and actions. The important thing is how we lead our lives in society, how we conduct ourselves each day, based on faith in the Mystic Law. Each of those actions helps pave the way for our attainment of Buddhahood.

So I will keep trying. I am really inspired by the Longhouse kids who just walked into a room with strangers and engaged with words, smiles, and sheer presence. 

I was 8-years-old, just the age of some of our kids, when the first symptoms of HS began to emerge. At this point the shunning started and I began to disengage. As I watched the interactions in the rec room, I teared up with thoughts of “what if only” and such. 

But I grabbed hold of myself and decided to just celebrate their ability to engage. So I went around and served the children pastries and juice.",2,1761662252.0,SGIWhistleblowersMITA,0,0.75,False

[Listen, I know this might be weird and confusing but you will understand by the end. My fiance and I have been together 5 years. We're getting married in a few months. I am known in my family as the babysitter. When things can't work out as planned with childcare and work schedules I help babysit the kids in my family just to help out and they pay what they can. My fiance and I have been together a long time so his character has never been called into question but I'm honestly rethinking a lot. With his life and mine we got together on the terms of no secrets, we share locations, phone passwords all of that. He works a 9-5 I homeschool our kid and do side hustles like caretaking of my elderly family members and kitchen hairstyles. Anyway, one of my female cousins that's 10 years my senior, I deal with her the same way. She has kids and recently divorced so single parent life really is an adjustment for her. ]


This past week, I was asleep and I heard her voice so I woke up. I realized she was on the phone. No problem there but then I realized she's on my fiancé's phone and asked him to help get her car started so she can go to work. Okay I join the conversation send him on his way remind him to get his lunch. I get up start my day going over lesson plans and I decided to check his location, he's still at her house an hour later. Okay maybe her battery is being weird I move on. But then I see he's been at her house twice over the last week. I finish my coffee and think about the this before I confront him. My day passes as normal but I get this feeling that I can't shake, so that afternoon I call him and ask how many times has he been there, he tells me the truth. I ask how many times has she called or text you asking you to come over there he tells me 3 or 4 times. Now I never questioned ever if this man or my cousin would do that to me, but then that nagging thought overcomes me. I talk to my fiance everyday, I talk to my cousin everyday, why didn't anybody tell me this level of communication is going on? My fiance assured me that he was just being helpful and apologized so we end that conversation. I called and asked my cousin why didn't she feel the need to communicate the fact that she's been in contact with him in general, before I finished my sentence she got very loud and defensive asking if I'm accusing her of anything then proceeds to tell me I'm crazy to even have any feelings about the situation for about 4 minutes until I hang up on her. Our entire family agrees that both of them should have told me something but understand that the intention wasn't to be unfaithful. And I originally felt that way, but her being defensive as far as name calling and verbal attacks makes me second guess that. He blocked her and I will continue checking locations and start checking the logs from our phone company, if there is anything going on I will know. She and I are now NC

EDIT.
Let me add this, in his defense, I have jumped her car off previous times. He did so knowingly once before. When I seen his location the times I didn't know about, it told me that he wasn't there past 10 minutes. When he was there for over an hour he made 2 trips to auto parts store. [ I'm not excusing behavior and will hold this mf man accountable] but I truly think he's just oblivious. 

Give your opinions let me know what you guys think, I added a lot for context but might be unnecessary ",157,1761662158.0,TwoHotTakes,135,0.93,False

I love to laugh — the kind of laugh that sneaks up on you until you can’t stop. I’m happiest outdoors, hiking, exploring new places, reading, or finding a new restaurant to try (especially if dessert’s involved). I’m also a bit of a DIY guy — I can fix things around the house, but I’ll probably still end up swearing at IKEA furniture along the way.

1oib0ql,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oib0ql,Explaining the portuguese beer take for the people visiting Portugal.,"As the boys said, most places only have either Super Bock or Sagres, in Porto there is mostly Super Bock because that is the city where it is from. We do have other major national brands beers (coral, cristal and tagus: image1),but most coffee shops, bakerys and restaurants are sponsored by either sagres or Super Bock, in porto mostly Super Bock. Due to the low minimum wage (870€/month) and since portugal has a big drinking culture, specifically with beer, we just stay with the cheap major brands that are everywhere instead of going for craft and international beers. 

If you come to Portugal and can afford 3€ to 4€ and want to experience good different beers, just go to ""Cervejarias"" , they are places with a big variety of portuguese and international beers that you usually eat with our traditional sides (an example is Brasão in Porto). Due to the price difference and our drinking culture we separate people that just want to have a good beer and the drunks that start chugging beers at 9am. 

Another interesting thing that may confuse tourists is the bars not having much diversity in terms os beer, this is because at night since even for the middle class is something you rarely do, bars have the cheap beer (a little more overpriced to turn a bigger profit) for the usual drunks and teens (yes teens, oops) and more expensive drinks like cocktails and gins for that middle class that rarely goes out to enjoy something expensive but smooth that you can't enjoy at home and are big enough to last while you talk with your friends.


Sorry for the long rant, but they real ragebaited me with the we needing to up our beer game, we have them, you just need to go to the right places, feel free to ask any questions if you are visiting Portugal soon!

1oiau1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1oiau1k/i_declined_on_a_client_that_wanted_to_train_with/,I declined on a client that wanted to train with me. I'm new in this business and I'm curious if I could handled it better,"Hi, I'm a new PT. I started this line of work 2 months ago. I studied a lot and feel confident about my knowledge of training. Although my sales skills are lacking for now, which is reflected in the number of clients I have (2 clients).

A woman came in for a consultation with me today. I asked her some questions about her health, goals, typical day, and whether her life is stressful, etc. After that, she did some squats, glute bridges, push-ups, etc. — just some exercises to get a grasp of her condition.

During the whole time, she talked a lot about her home situation. She has 2 kids, a job, is divorced, and currently in a 1-year relationship with a partner (not his kids, but they live together). Her partner has a job but doesn’t help around the house or with the kids. Basically, she takes care of the home and family alone and also works full-time. Because of that, she usually eats one meal a day and drinks a lot of coffee and energy drinks, and she smokes. She usually sleeps 5 hours a day, sometimes 7.

Besides talking about her home situation, she also talked a lot about how bad she is. How stressed out she is. That everyone is looking at her and making fun of her. She came to me because she wanted to lose some weight around her belly and have bigger glutes. She said that her face is pretty, but her body is ugly. She wants to do something about that so she would feel better. She wants to feel attractive to her partner (who checks out girls in front of her and even DMs girls on the internet telling them they look good), as he’s not giving her attention.

At the end of our session, after hearing all this, I told her that to lose weight, she would need to change some things in her daily life. I gave her some examples like eating regularly, eating more vegetables, adding more soups to her menu, sleeping more, and replacing simple carbohydrates with whole grains. I asked her if it was doable for her to make any of those changes.

She said no. Then I told her that I would like to train with her someday, but maybe it’s not the right time for her to start her fitness journey. I told her that what she needs right now is more help around the house from her partner and her kids (if they’re old enough). Otherwise, if she just adds strength training to her weekly routine, she’ll only get more tired and there won’t be much change in her physique.

I asked her if she had considered therapy so she could learn how to properly communicate with her family that she needs help and to rebuild her self-worth. She said she had thought about it a lot but was reluctant to take action. She also said that she came to me to make herself more attractive to her partner, not for herself.

So I gave her the contact of the therapist who helped me. She cried a lot, thanked me, and said that I had helped her a lot. I hugged her, and she left.

From the perspective of a good person, I feel like I did something good. I don’t have any doubt about that. But as I said previously, I’m not a good salesman yet, and I struggle to get clients. I’m wondering if I could have handled it better — so that I not only helped her but also helped my business.   
If you have any advice for me, thank you. If not, thank you for reading :)

1oiatvj,https://i.redd.it/xmsy0w0nbsxf1.jpeg,Chain of Destiny by Betty Neels Is A Victorian Romance Set in 1989,"Let’s get a show of hands, how many of you love Mr. Rochester?

Anyone? Really? Not a single one of you?

Huh, strange. I guess none of you are 16-year-old me, reading Jane Eyre for the first time and crying simultaneous tears of joy and sadness. Joy because thank fuck Jane and Rochester are reunited! Sadness because nobody will love me like Rochester loves Jane! Sure, he’s brusque and abrupt and manipulative, and there is something off about his attic, but still, that’s real love, isn’t it? 

*Isn’t it?*

It took me at least 15 years to figure out that it’s probably for the best that nobody would love me like Rochester loves Jane because ew gross no. Leave her alone! Go get help! You already ruined one woman’s life; let this one be!

Unfortunately, the young heroine of Betty Neels’ Chain of Destiny has not reached my level of enlightenment and accepts the older, ruder hero’s abrupt offer of marriage as romantic and wonderful, instead of not good enough.

Although this novel was published in 1989, it feels like it could be set anywhere between 1850 and 1930. There are so few references to modern life or even the turbulent and complicated state of England, and especially London, and so many positively Victorian details that I totally forgot that TVs, modern medicine and women’s independence were a “thing” at the time.

**The Plot**

Poor, as in actually financially struggling, Suzannah Lightfoot has it tough. She lives in a small village, in a small cottage with her ailing aunt and has a small part-time job as a guide for a local historic estate. To add insult to injury, she’s an orphan; her parents perished in an accident. She was supposed to go to University and got it, but now she’s too poor to study. And most insultingly, Suzannah is not pretty, or striking, or interesting-looking. She’s very plain and very drab. 

It’s grim.

Things only get grimmer for poor Ms. Lightfoot when she meets the handsome, rude and arrogant Professor Guy Bowers-Bentinck. Hyphenated name, so you know he’s got an estate or two himself, and his family tree is just minor royals and various lords. He’s taking a tour of the estate, but is actually casually dating the owner’s granddaughter. The terrible OW thinks is kind of lameballs that Guy chooses to work when he doesn’t need to, what a bore!

Suzannah’s aunt is dying of a brain tumour; however, the local doctor has forbidden anyone from telling the aunt about her condition. She just thinks she’s got terrible headaches and not in her last two months of life.

When the aunt falls into a coma, it’s sheer good luck that the most prominent English brain surgeon, Professor Guy Bowers-Bentinck is in town. He breaks the bad news to Suzannah, her aunt is going to pass away in this coma in a day or two, and he is remarkably kind and empathetic. 

This is not a permanent state.

Days after the funeral, Suzannah is asked to vacate the cottage that was given for a lifetime to her aunt. Yep, the estate owners' terrible granddaughter, who is fucking Professor B-B (you can use your own stand-in for his name, but I like Buttface-Butthole), kicks poor Suzannah out with nowhere to go! And her job is cancelled.

Suzannah is despondent; she needs to find work, and she needs to move, along with her sweet cat Horace. She can’t find a job because she doesn’t know shorthand, and she doesn’t want to be a domestic.

When Professor B-B comes asking if she needs help, he finds her crying and abruptly tells her to stop that. When she wails and asks him to get lost, he fucks off, thinking Why do I bother with ugly bitches like these?

Probably. I’m editorializing, but this is my review.

Despite being ugly, Suzannah is capable, steady and competent. So Professor B-B decides to help her out behind the scenes by having his aristocratic aunts offer her a job “sorting paperwork in the attic”. 

After she’s done that, he offers her a job looking after a young, beautiful patient of his in, you’ll never believe, Holland, where Suzannah is treated terribly but is well paid and thrillingly gets to spend more time with Prof. B-B.

As they spend more and more time together, day trips across Holland and dinners at upscale restaurants, the Professor decides that beyond being only so-so in the face, Suzannah does have beautiful grey eyes and a very sensuous mouth. Also, she’s got fiery red hair, and that really gets his juices flowing.

Well, not flowing or juices, it’s Betty Neels, but he thinks about her hair a lot!

Suzannah, being independent and stubborn, wants to refuse B-B’s help, partially because he’s very mean to her. He keeps telling her to shut up and stop talking, and stop crying, and basically treats her like a child. And not a person with few economic opportunities at a time of extreme political austerity and rising inflation. 

Thank you, Thatcherism! God, Professor B-B probably voted for her. Repeatedly! 

He’s not making things easy for Suzannah with the introduction of aggressive and violent kisses after each offer of help, which is alternated with derisive comments and brusque dismissiveness. 

To his credit, he does help her quite a bit, providing assistance with travel, and does this removed sort of caretaking. When all of Suzannah’s possessions are lost in a fire, the girl got the worst luck; he has his housekeeper buy her a brand new wardrobe. He has his driver pick her up and drive her around when she’s looking for new jobs. He has his staff look after Horace the cat when she’s unable to care for him. 

No wonder poor Suzannah can’t figure out how he feels about her; everything he does is through an intermediary, someone else hired by him is always doing the caretaking and saying the nice words, and being kind. He just gets her menial jobs and then forgets about her while he’s busy being brilliant and operating on state dignitaries. 

So Suzannah remains in a state of constant confusion; she’s in love with Pr. BB, but surely he does not love her back. Even when he takes her to see his own sprawling estate and tells her how he hopes that his Wife HINT and future children HINT will live there, and how they HINT will all commute from London and how it’s a beautiful HINT place for children to live and how HINT perfect the large and sprawling garden is for kids and HINT cats.

Suzannah heartily agrees and thinks how lucky the professor’s future wife will be, then she runs away and hides her whereabouts from him. 

**The Place**

Nothing in the book reflects contemporary English life. Suzannah hates TV and prefers to spend her evening knitting sweaters, walking her cat and listening to the radio. The only references to contemporary brands or products are the cars driven by the wealthy characters: a Land Rover, a Bentley and a Rolls-Royce. 

The UK of real life raged on in the late 80s, Thatcher’s rule was on its last legs, there were regular bombings across the country, the Hillsborough tragedy would have reconings and repercussions for many years and decades to come. But Neels takes us back, to a different place, a different English village and a different London, untouched by political unrest, strikes or inflation. Her heroine lives a humdrum life, quiet and not always pleasant, but away from the volatility of contemporary England. Professor B-B doesn’t even let her travel through London after 8 pm.

Suzannah spends a considerable amount of time in the attic of an old sprawling estate, organizing dance cards from balls attended by members of the Professor’s family or alternatively, sitting quietly in sad flatlets with sad curtains and sweet Horace the cat. We hit almost every Victorian interior setting, from the grim, where Suzannah belongs, to the sumptuous, from which she is purposefully excluded. 

Class is emphasized in all caps and bold type throughout the book, and its limitations are so pronounced, so rigid that when the horrible OW tries to scare off Suzannah, she does so by likening her to a “lame dog”, a sad sack type that Professor B-B just loves to help out of the goodness of his heart.

 She compares a lower-middle-class woman to a dog. 

You don’t need to tell me who the terrible OW voted for; we all know. 

It’s a well-written story, Neels' prose always delivers, but the romance was so cold, so distant, with no yearning and so few feelings that I’m not sure Suzannah’s life will improve beyond the material comforts after marriage. The professor, you just know she will only call him that, will live his important, active life while Suzannah will be the steady and capable mother of his children, and in the best-case scenario, his devoted and competent nurse. 

At least I hope he stops telling her to shut up and stop talking. 

**Final Nibbles**

* Here are all the dishes mentioned in the book: smoked eel, roast pheasant with red cabbage, paper-thin pancakes with syrup, cheese souffles, mousseline of chicken with caviar, salmon in lobster sauce, steak and kidney pudding with oysters and mushrooms, boiled potatoes, boiled sprouts, a bread and butter pudding, champagne, and endless coffee.
* Professor B-B comments on how normal it is for patients to think they are in love with their doctors after they finish treatment. This is why the Buttface-Butthole name sticks. 
* The only decent thing about B-B is his long-haired dachshund named Henry, who gets along with Horace the cat very well. 
* Horace the cat is nice to everyone except the horrible OW, he attacks her and scratches her stockings!
* There are three kisses in the book, all are described as violent. ",14,1761661586.0,RomanceBooks,7,0.95,False

There is this r/decaf sub where people say life is better without caffeine. But these are probably high-anxiety individuals.

At the moment I'm off caffeine and feel unwell psychologically and a bit depressed. Anxiety is not a problem. I think I was in a better mood when I was on coffee.

Maybe Vladdie ends up with one of the best plakatas in the history of the game in the 9th.  

Last night/this morning's game could have gone our way 4 or 5 times. We went toe to toe with the team ""breaking baseball"" for 17 innings.  With a little luck, we're up 2-1 and with a lot we're up 3-0.  

Going into the series the narrative, at least in the US media (where I am), was that the Dodgers were probably going to sweep the Jays, and that they were absolutely unbeatable.  Their pitching was unhittable, their offense was unstoppable, Dave Roberts was the best manager in the history of the game and the plucky team from north of the border was an obvious underdog and what a good story it is that they made it to the WS.  It started to feel like the talking heads assumed the Jays would lose in 3, because they'd get blown out so badly in the first three games that MLB would just cancel game 4 and give Ohtani the trophy, the MVP, 2 cupcakes and a pony. 

Well respectfully, fuck that.  Fuck that right in the ear.  

In three games we've shown that we can not only hang, but absolutely are capable of winning the series.   We are NOT going quietly into the history books as a speed bump that the Dodgers drove over.  We're going to win a game in LA and get this series back home, and then we're going to win games 6 and 7 to finish the job on a walk-off from Kirk.  You heard it here first, touch 'em all Alejandro.  

So get some coffee, put on your Jays gear and let's get this thing going in the right direction.  We beat the Yankees so badly that I haven't seen that stupid abomination of an overlaid N and Y in weeks, and I live in an area with a shit-ton of Yankee fans.  We were down 0-2 to Seattle after losing both games at home, and we dumped them in 7 to get here. 

Yeah, we're down 2-1, but we've overcome far worse.  We are not dead yet, and we aren't leaving any time soon.

She huffs, “Do you *really* expect me to believe some campfire story? Is this just a ploy to get back together?”

Needless to say, my attempts to explain what the Gooweny-Ein[ ](https:)is and the very real danger he poses are not going over well with my ex-girlfriend. “You saw him,” I reply. “Did he look human to you?”

Stacey scoffs, but she crosses her arms and clenches her jaw in such a way that I can tell she doesn’t have a rebuttal. “It wasn’t the Goony-En or whatever you called it.” She says after a moment. “Listen to yourself. Curses! Monsters! This is crazy!”

“Trust me, I know it’s crazy.” I say, “But it’s true. You have to trust me.”

“Trust you!” She yells as if this is the most obscene thing I’ve ever said, and I know for a fact it’s not. She’s heard me say some pretty stupid things.

“If you see him again, you’ll die…or worse.” I reiterate, thinking again of the descriptions I’ve read of that woman cutting herself in half with a chainsaw, and how she’d attacked her parents before killing herself.  

Stacey looks like she’s going to argue for a moment, but instead she slumps down on my couch and rubs her forehead with both hands. “I need a drink.” She says wearily.

“You sure that’s a good idea?” I ask, thinking of our last fight. I’m not going to say that alcohol caused our argument, but it was certainly a factor.

She glares at me, and, sighing, I relent. I’ve put all my hard liquor and most of my beer on top of my kitchen cabinets, right up near the ceiling. Keeping it out of reach has prevented me from drowning in it these past few days, but for Stacey, I get my step stool out and pull down a bottle of dark rum. I get us each a glass and some ice, take the cap off the liquor, and watch as the golden liquid flows over cubes as clear as Icelandic spar.

Stacey remains on my couch, wringing her hands and looking around nervously. When I bring over the rum, she snatches it from me with a trembling hand. By the time I put the bottle on the coffee table and sit down beside her, she’s already polished off her drink and has taken a few additional gulps right from the bottle.

She fills her cup again, “I’d ask how things have been going for you…” she says with a laugh as filled to the brim with sarcasm as her glass is with rum.

“I wouldn’t bother,” I reply, adding my own bitter laugh to hers.

“So, how long has that thing been after you?” She asks after a few more swigs. Her words are starting to slur.

“Four days,” I answer, avoiding her gaze. I want to say so much - about our breakup, about how sorry I am that she’s wrapped up in this curse with me - but I can’t find the words.

She nods and sucks in the sides of her cheeks a bit as if to say “that’s unfortunate” without being too sincere about it. Then, she blows air out of her mouth as if she’s anxiously trying to think of something else to say. I get the sense she resents me; she doesn’t want to, but she does; though I don’t know if it’s over our breakup, the monster stalking us, or both. “Is that how long I’m going to be stuck here?” She says after a moment, her voice quiet, “Because I had plans this weekend, you know? And I have a job. I don’t even have my laptop.” She laughs, though I know for damn sure she doesn’t find this funny, “If I had known I’d be trapped in your apartment, I would have packed a bag or something.” As her tone becomes less sincere, her gestures become more grandiose, and I can tell she’s drunk.

“I’m trying to think of some way out of this,” I say. “I’m doing everything I can.”

She nods her head as one side of her mouth dimples with a sort of melancholy. “I know you will.” She says gently. For a moment, she looks as if she might say something profound or vulnerable, but instead she gets up and announces that she’s going to bed. I watch her stumble to my room, unsure if she wants me to follow or not. I suppose I'm uncertain if it's right to follow, really. I decide to sit out on my couch, slowly finishing off my glass of rum as I try to think of how to get us both out of the Gooweny-Ein’s clutches.

After maybe twenty minutes, I go in to check on her, expecting to find her passed out in my bed. Instead, I find her standing straight up, looking in the direction of the blinds. “Stacey?” I say cautiously. Before she can respond, I see that the edge of the blinds is folded, as if someone has moved them. *She’s* moved them, I realize. In her drunken state, she must have lifted them to look outside when the Gooweny-Ein tapped on the window and called for her. Maybe she briefly forgot about the curse and only caught herself too late, or perhaps curiosity just got the best of her. Whatever happened, it's sealed her fate, and likely mine too.

She turns slowly. Her eyes are wide with fright. Her clothing is cut down the middle, right where the ribs meet the sternum. It's not just her clothing that’s been sliced, though; there’s blood all down her shirt, and I can see through layers of skin and muscle deep into her chest cavity. There’s something else in there, too – something moving. It stretches and contorts as if it’s trying to force itself into a tight pair of jeans – only those jeans are her body. Her arms raise, and I hear popping and crunching sounds as her muscles try to resist, but she’s not in control anymore; the Gooweny-Ein is piloting her from the inside now. I stare at her as if trapped in a trance, and I’m sure my own look of terror matches hers. Supposedly, when you’re scared, your heart pounds, but the sight is so horrific that I swear mine stops.",1,1761661102.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1oiam0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSeattle/comments/1oiam0m/moving_from_louisiana_to_seattle_washington_tell/,"Moving from Louisiana to Seattle, Washington! Tell me everything I need to know! 🌧️","
Hey everyone! (Long post ahead🫣)

I’m planning to move from Louisiana to Seattle by December 2026 (or maybe even earlier if things go right). I know I’m super early, but I want to get ahead of things so I have time to plan, save, and adjust if anything goes sideways.

I’m currently working front desk for a hotel and don’t mind continuing to work in hospitality when I move there. I have an Associate’s degree in Business Administration. I know it isn’t some big fancy degree, but it’s something I’m proud of. I’d really like to work my way up, gain experience, and eventually grow into a stable career that I enjoy. 

Where I’m from, we don’t really have any public transportation. So that’ll be a big adjustment for me. I’ve never relied on buses, trains, or anything like that before, but I’m excited (and a little nervous) to learn how to get around without a car. 

I’m also trying to figure out the most affordable and safe neighborhoods, with studio or 1b1b ideally under $1700 (if possible in this economy)that has in-unit laundry, at least 300 sq ft, and must have an oven since I love to bake. 

I’m also scared of leaving my family behind and starting over somewhere so far away. I want to grow, travel, and really become the version of myself I know I can be. I’ve never done a big move like this or at all really and honestly, I’m equal parts excited and terrified. Seattle has for a while now felt like it’s calling to me, but part of me wonders if I’m just infatuated with the idea of it. Seattle feels like the place I could really grow, but I can’t help overthinking everything. What if I fail, can’t find a job, or don’t make friends? What if I get there and it’s not what I expected? I just want to make sure I’m preparing myself the right way.

So… for anyone who lives in Seattle (or moved there recently):
	•	What’s something you wish you knew before moving there?
	•	How do you navigate public transportation as a beginner?
	•	Which neighborhoods would you recommend for someone without a car?
	•	What’s the social scene like? Is it really hard to make friends?
	•	Any advice for adjusting to the weather, cost of living, or general pace of life since I come from a small town?

Also, I’d love to start making friends with people now, even if it’s just online, before I move. I’m also planning a visit in March 2026 to get a real feel of it and do some exploring. I’m also really hoping to find a safe, welcoming community somewhere that’s accepting of everyone, friendly, and has people around my age (I’m 22F turning 23 before the move). I’d love to be in an area where I can actually meet people, make friends, and feel comfortable being myself.

The weather doesn’t bother me I actually don’t mind gloomy or rainy days at all; they’ve always felt kind of peaceful to me.

As for me, I love baking, writing, learning new things, exploring new places, watching movies, and just being creative in general. I’d love to find little coffee shops, bookstores, and quiet spots to unwind and maybe some fun local events to get out of my shell a bit! 

I know I still have time before the move, but I really want to start preparations now so it doesn’t feel overwhelming when it’s time. Seattle seems like such a beautiful, inspiring place, and even though I’m scared, I’m excited to take this leap. Any advice, insights, or even just a few kind words from people who’ve been through something similar would mean the world. 💙",11,1761661080.0,AskSeattle,55,0.69,False
