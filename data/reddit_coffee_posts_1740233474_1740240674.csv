1ivlvj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ivlvj0/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_always_be_the_one_to_hop/,AITA for not agreeing to always be the one to hop out and pick up my wife's coffee when she's driving?,"My wife and I were driving to my parents' house, and as usual, she was the driver because she gets carsick if she isn't behind the wheel. Right after we got into the car, she asked if we could stop at Dunkin' for coffee. She mentioned she didn’t have enough points for me to get one too, but I didn’t really care since I prefer my parents' coffee anyway.

Usually, when we do a coffee run, she parks, and I go inside to grab her order. It’s not an every-time thing, but it happens often, and I don’t mind. This time, however, the parking lot was full, so instead of parking, she asked me to hop out while she found a spot. I made a lighthearted joke about how she wasn’t getting me a coffee but still expected me to fetch hers, and she got upset because, according to her, I had “missed my window” to get out immediately. So she huffed out and got it herself.

When she came back, she asked me if I could always be ready to get out and pick up orders whenever we're running errands while she’s driving. I told her I was happy to do it most of the time, but I needed her to communicate her expectations. That’s when she told me she wants me to just ""use my eyes and see what she sees"" so she doesn’t have to communicate, because apparently, that takes too long.

I told her that while I’m happy to help, I’m not going to commit to a blanket rule where I just always do it—she needs to communicate what she wants. She disagreed, said I'm being an asshole and asked me to bring it to the fine folks of this subreddit.

Possibly unrelated but not really, she followed up with a request/demand that I be present while she's driving. As in off my phone - which I can understand. But when I said as much but asked if she could likewise agree to be off her phone during conversations, especially with other people, she countered that she can multitask but I can't -_-. 

So, AITA for not just agreeing to always be the one to hop out and pick up her coffee when she’s driving?",1,1740239965.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

I quit energy drinks a while ago but usually drink 4-5 shots of espresso any morning. I am planning on cutting down to 3 shots (did this past week) then two shots next week, one shot after that, to decaf or no coffee in a few weeks. I would go cold turkey but I am trying to quit nicotine at the same time and I just know it wouldn’t work and I would go back to one or the other. 

Is this too fast or slow of a timeline to be reliable? Will I experience the same amount of withdrawal symptoms towards the end? Any insight or advice would be appreciated.

1ivlp38,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ivlp38/is_gender_therapy_right_for_me_hrt/,Is gender therapy right for me? hrt?,"Hi everyone, so this post is gonna be a bit all over the place, I'm a 33M btw. I feel like I'm not really looking for an answer/advice, but validation, but please if you have advice do not hesitate to give it to me :). If anything I write here comes off as offensive, I apologize in advance. Never in my life did I think i would be writing a question like this here, so I'm heavily doubting myself and if I'm crazy.

I'm like super confused right now because I'm experiencing this all super fast. I say this because I'm really sensitive to caffeine, and I got this high quality coffee and I started drinking it, which has uplifted my mood, gave me higher energy, made me more talkative but has also ruined my sleep quality. My sister actually told me I should drink coffee every day because she likes me a lot more like this because I'm more fun to be around.

My point of saying all of this is that caffeine has also greatly amplified my desire to be feminine. I'm not sure why but I know that caffeine can't create new desires, it can only bring to the surface what is already there? My entire life I've always had a fascination with certain feminine clothing and I have always been jealous of girls for a few different reasons like all the cute clothes they get to wear, color options/aesthetics and just their ability to more easily get away with being cute and child-like and having things like stuffed animals and feminine decor (see kawaii aesthetic). I always had a sissy fetish and an abdl fetish (not sure how relevant that is but I put it here to get it out of my chest) so I would often like and imagine myself as a girl. Its strange because I have fantasies of being taken out on a date by a guy and being his gf, but I know I'm straight and attracted to women. I just don't see myself playing a masculine-male role in a relationship. This is the primary reason I've had difficulty in finding a relationship is that I can't accept being the masculine/dominate normative stereotype just is impossible for me.

Somewhat recently I learned about femboys, and I felt that term really resonated me. I like it because I'm 100% a guy, but I like and prefer femininity. So yesterday after months of avoidance, I finally got myself (with the help of coffee) to go to goodwill and get myself some women's jeans, and some shirts. When I tried it on in the changing room, OMG at that moment I knew I never want to wear mens jeans again, and maybe not shirts/tops either. Like today I looked at my favorite pair of guy jeans and I'm kinda grossed out by them and want to throw it out. I wore of the women's jeans out to an event that night and it just felt right, like I felt more confident, even though the jeans kinda pass for gender neutral. Like now I want to get rid of my wardrobe and only have feminine-cut clothing. I can't/won't do skirts and starkly female clothing for reasons, but I would like all my clothes to have feminine silhouettes. It's like a light switch flicked on when I tried those jeans.

 It's weird cause I want to look like a girl so that if someone glances at me and doesn't see my face, they will subconsciously determine that I'm a girl, but I also don't want any of that at the same time. Like its confusing cause I don't want people to think I'm trans because I'm not cause I still and will continue to identify as a guy. Although you reading this post may give you a different impression, I dunno. I guess I just don't want this stuff to make my life more complicated than it already is.



So all of that was background info to get to the main point of my post. I have been considering therapy for other reasons for a long time, but I have kept avoiding it, partially due to me not wanting to discuss these things with someone, and also partially for being confused by all the different therapy modalities and such. Not in a million years did I think gender therapy would be something applicable to me, but trying on those women's jeans brought to the surface feelings I've been avoiding, which made me consider a therapist with skills in gender expression.

I guess what confuses me is that I identify as a guy, but is gender expression a thing and is that something to work through in therapy? I guess I would need a therapist who is kink aware, gender aware, aware of religion and how it impacts mental health (forgot to mention I'm religious which adds a whole nother later).

I also never in a million years think HRT is something I would want to do but all of this stuff had gotten me thinking. I had initially thought you needed to work through this stuff with a therapist to help you figure out if HRT is right for you, but I was unaware of ""informed consent"" and there happens to be places near me in Houston. Am I crazy for even thinking about HRT? Not gonna lie, part of me wanted to go to therapy, hoping the therapist would suggest HRT to me, but I feel like that is evidence why i SHOULD'NT consider HRT. Part of me was also hoping going to therapy would convince me that all this stuff is not what I need and I don't need HRT or to switch my wardrobe to women's clothing. 

Then I learn about ""informed consent"" and I feel like I'm crazy for wanting to go to planned parenthood next week. My mind is saying to trial run HRT because I want the bodily changes. I would also like to experience the mental and emotional changes and see how it is for me. I'm 5'5 and 115lbs so I've always been thin and felt kinda effeminate and I've never liked the idea of bulking on muscle. I much prefer the lean and feminine look. I do ballet barre and home and I quite like it. I feel insane for wanting to bypass therapy and test out HRT. What should I do? ",1,1740239490.0,asktransgender,0,1.0,False

Since I have two I tried on both, same issue. One of the two is in far better condition than the other and it’s equally stuck. 

Btw, if you ever see one of these be warned that the metal shell is welded into place, which makes getting at the motor super hard. Maybe I will have to grind it and pull it off to do this but I’m trying to avoid that. 

I’m nearly positive it will come out as it’s a separate material from the motor casting but I can’t even see a seam. 

The front burr plate was supposed to “just pull out” according to the service manual but it took me a week of torch, PB blaster and wrenching to break 90days of coffee oil and rust. But now it looks awesome. 

Eric suggested I try to use the same technique as a flywheel and I watched a few videos today however the center shaft isn’t connected to the burr as far as I can tell, it goes deep into the motor.

1ivligj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/comments/1ivligj/ares_a_postgame_analysis/,Ares: a postgame analysis,"Yo yo yo, welcome to Saturday morning coffee thoughts with LB. Today's topic, Ares and you. You may not have met Ares yet. You may have had a first encounter and [enjoyed getting blasted into oblivion](https://i.redd.it/77neuwk8b6ke1.jpeg). I have fought him more times than I can count in my Epoch exploration, and I've spilled reams of digital ink on dissecting his abilities and learning his mechanics. This post is for those who have despaired in their initial attempts, or are dreading their first time. I'm here to tell you that you're not bad, and Ares isn't unfair (though his design is questionable but we'll get to that). The bottom line: **Ares is doable, you (and literally everyone else) just need to practice.**   

First, let's talk about what's good with Ares. He's a different type of boss fight, and variety is the spice of life. He's also satisfying to beat because he's so difficult at first. And obviously the fact that any champ can beat him means winning is not about roster, but about player abilities.   

But there's plenty of bad things too. I'll focus on one: as a fighting game boss, Ares as a whole is poorly designed because he doesn't require an overall fighting strategy. What I mean by that is that he doesn't require a broad approach to the fight that's present in most other MCOC battles. To beat Bahamut, you need to push the boss to a particular level, then execute a specific punishment depending on the phase, all toward triggering an window to do more damage. Superior Kang also requires a greater vision of triggering specific events at specific times to generate charges you can then cash out to do damage. These bosses require a general vision of the fight to win. By contrast, winning against Ares requires prevailing in repeated minigames and/or revive spamming. It's just (1) get him to a special, (2) identify the special he's throwing (3) follow the required pattern. That's it, no overall vision or planning necessary. I'm not saying Ares doesn't require skill. But it's not good design in a fighting game to define success in mechanics that don't actually involve fighting. At that point, it's just DDR for your fingers.    

But there's a bigger point in all this: you can learn how to fight Ares, and you get better with that practice. The more you learn his mechanics and signs (head over to the [MEGATHREAD comment about Ares](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/s/SnxJdTVzaS) for some great community tips), the better you'll become. Of course it's poor design to place a boss that can only be beaten by practice at the end of an endgame gauntlet that then demands excessive revive spamming to master. But if Ares were, for example, introduced as other Seasons of Suck bosses were (one fight, 6 energy), no one would care. If anything, the community would welcome the challenge he poses as we all struggle to master his mechanics.    

So the bottom line: **don't despair if you chuck 30+ revives at Ares.** I promise that you will learn from your mistakes and improve in your subsequent runs, because everyone does once they get a feel for how he works. We're talking about practice. Practice practice practice. Literally every player needs practice before feeling like they have a hang of the fight (including MSD, [who admitted yesterday he practiced the Ares fight before going live](http://youtube.com/post/UgkxwMJdW3C4_ZnewXBShW1DIY4FxcXNx-c4)). Even highly skilled players conquer him by nothing more than dying over and over again. You are not alone, and even if you never reach the solo-levels of the top players, struggling with Ares doesn't mean you suck at this game. You're great, and you'll beat him with enough reps, just like everyone else.     

Don't give up! Keep fighting that jerk, make him earn every revive you fling, and master his demands that [you dance the night away](https://youtu.be/llfjDUB66Z4). He'll say dance for me, [monkey](https://youtu.be/q0hyYWKXF0Q)!  And you'll say, [I can dance if I want to](https://youtu.be/nM4okRvCg2g), and I'll leave your ass behind.",6,1740238990.0,ContestOfChampions,7,0.88,False

I’ve tried the slow fade, I tried cancelling, but she CALLS me all the time. She keeps tabs on when I am in the neighborhood through my stories and when I am coming back if I am travelling (for example, I will tell her I can’t meet as I am abroad and as soon as she sees that I am back she calls me). 

I really thought she’d get the message by now….as I haven’t initiated a convo or a meeting with her ONCE. 

I know that she’s the type of person that if I tell her I am not feeling this friendship that she might go full psycho on me. Please help! ",3,1740238953.0,socialskills,7,0.8,False

1ivlfvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ivlfvn/how_to_tell_someone_with_avoidant_attachment_you/,How to tell someone with avoidant attachment you like them,"I (M 33) was in a situationship with a younger guy (M 24) for about six months last year. He has a strongly avoidant attachment style (rarely texts first, often takes days to reply, not great at reading emotions) but I was really persistent and for about 6 months we texted every week and were meeting up for coffee, drinks or sex pretty frequently. During that time I felt like I was falling for him but since he had already decided to move away for a new job I held back from saying anything about feelings, although I definitely let him know how much I liked hanging out. 

After he moved, I was in his new city for work and we met up. We spent most of two days together, and afterwards he texted me to say thanks for making time. A couple of days later he texted again to say he'd been diagnosed with ADHD, which explained a lot.

Since then we've only been in touch a handful of times. I was expecting to forget about him and move on, but even though I haven't seen him for months I have the feeling that if I don't find a way to give this a fair shot and tell him how I feel I will regret it.

What I'm having trouble wrapping my head around is how to bring this up with someone who's not great at responding to other peoples' emotions or sharing his own and who I'm guessing will shut down if he feels put on the spot.

Maybe I'm overreacting but maybe I'm not. I work full time so I don't get to spend much time with my mum and dad, they're both in their 60's. Dad works and mum is retired. I want to spend time with them as I hardly ever get to (what with work and everything) but they just don't seem to want to? I try to get dad to come and so things with me, go to the movies or something and just get either a ""maybe"" or ""sorry (insert sports team) is playing today"". My mum never wants to do anything either, she spends all her time sat on her phone. I will ask her if she wants to go shopping or go sit in the coffee shop for a bit and she just, doesn't want to? Literally dad just spends all his time sat watching various sports teams play games and mum just sits in the chair on her phone. That's it. 

I dunno if I'm being oversensitive but it kind of upsets me? I don't have anyone but them. I want to spend time with them, I'll pay for coffe, meals, anything. I just want to do something with them. I have tried to gently say that I miss not being able to spend time with them but they don't really react? I just get something along the lines of ""that's what happens when you're older"" etc. Maybe I'm selfish, I don't really know. I just needed to say it. ",1,1740238745.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1ivlenl,https://i.redd.it/gccy2jr4npke1.jpeg,Mug review!,"Finally got my legacy mug! Lovely design straight out of the game, holds quite a bit of liquid, and feels lightweight but solid at the same time.

just..two things I wish would be different. 
1) the small handle (and the cup itself) heats up significantly and quickly (within ten seconds) when holding hot liquids to the point where it is uncomfortable to hold it for more than a few seconds, therefore not properly useable as a mug for fresh coffee or tea, etc unless it cools down a bit. 

The handle is also too small for me to get a full grip on it and my fingers are not that big. Gotta do the 2 fingers in,  and ring on the bottom kinda hold, which is not fun with a hot handle.


2) I may need to test a bit but it feels like the liquids in the mug cool down faster than a porcelain mug. Maybe it's the design/materials.

3/5

It's been so long in this time loop that you got comfortable. Perhaps that was why you felt terrified seeing something new for the first time in ages.

# Story - 

The alarm next to the bed screamed at you to wake up. Every morning it did the same thing. 6:00am on the dot.

Rolling out of bed, the familiar cracks and pops of your body echo in the quiet and dark room. Sleep had been difficult, but it always had been difficult. Shuffling across the carpet, into the kitchen where you promptly turn back and grab the slippers you always seem to forget. That floor was cold, shocking your body every morning.

You remind yourself to invest in some kitchen rugs as the dark roasted coffee pours into your favorite mug. You smile a bit, reading the quip that had been painted onto the side of it. Something about how rough Mondays were. You used this mug every day, even when it wasn't Monday.

The fresh air hits your face, watching the birds that fluttered and flew around the trees rooted in your backyard. You told yourself a long time ago that the best way to start the day was a cup of coffee, and waking up with the sun. So that's what you've done, for years it seems.

Once the mug is empty, you look out across the yard and wave to the black cat that makes his daily trek along the wooden fence, always stopping to look over at you.

The rest of the morning routine is the same as everyone else's. You nick yourself shaving, again, and pray that your shampoo has just enough left in the bottle until you can go to the store. It always does.

The drive to work is short, you didn't live far from the office thankfully. You chuckle at the kid who falls down as he tries to catch the bus he missed again. Memories of when you were a child flashing through your mind.

The work day is easy. A string of numbers flashing across your screen as you input them into the correct spreadsheets. Your boss interrupts you to ask you how those numbers are looking.

You smile, and give your usual, 'They are looking beautiful as always!' phrase. Despite using this response ever since you started, he laughs with you still. Turning to walk back to his desk

Lunch was easy, you enjoyed a small prepackaged salad from the grocery store. It was your last one of the week, so you had made a note to get more the next time you were at store, always needing to go to the store. You took a bite, the crunch was satisfying to hear. You could listen to that every day if you chose too.

The end of the day came to a close, and as you went to get into your car you realized you left your keys in the office. One of these days you'll remember to grab them.

Back home again you could finally relax. You were hungry, but decided to wait a bit, choosing instead to scroll mindlessly on your phone before tossing it to the side

It was the same stuff as always. Influencers promoting the same boring products, the same news stories over and over, trends that were so similar it wasn't even worth paying attention to.\*

\*Dinner was supposed to be a bowl of ramen you had been thinking about on the drive home, but you forgot to go the store. The space where the noodles sat was empty. You can't remember the last time you had ramen, so the disappointment was huge.

Instead settling for a frozen dinner that had been buried in the freezer before stepping back out on your porch. The sunset was always beautiful, a perfect orange-red backdrop for your favorite bird to fly across

The hawk flew over your head, bringing a smile to your face and you watched it circle and then fly off into the distance. It was a special moment you two shared every evening. He never failed to visit you. You hoped he would visit you every day

The rest of the evening was spent cleaning up, putting off the laundry that was always full off, and just turning on your tv for background noise before you crawled back into bed. Your alarm wasn't set, it was the weekend, you smiled at the thought of sleeping in. The weekends always passed by so quickly it's almost like they didn't happen. As you fell asleep, you thought to yourself.

**Today really was, a good day.**

Once the mug is empty, you look out across the yard, about to wave to the black cat that makes his daily trek along the wooden fence. Except, it's not a black cat.

You stare, your eyes soaking up the snow white cat that now sits perched on the fence post.  
This feeling of panic, of terror, rises up in your throat. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you that this is wrong.  
You continue to stare as the alarm bells in your head continue to blare.  
The white cat doesn't move. It sits there, it's piercing gaze looking directly at you. You aren't even sure why this bothers you so much.

It just....is not what was supposed to happen.

Minutes pass by and your panic finally dissipates when the white cat hops down, hidden from your view, and the familiarity of the black one brings a sigh of relief from your lips. You wave to the black cat as he makes his trek across the wooden fence, and as you turn to go inside, you realize you had dropped your favorite mug.

It lay broken at your feet.   
The sound of it hitting the ground never even registered in your mind. You stare down, the broken mug and jumbled up quip stare back up at you. Taunting you. Further breaking the lovely routine, the peaceful loop, that was your life.

Your morning routine was cut short in order to save time. You catch up to where you're supposed to be in your routine. The drive to work is short, you didn't live far from the office thankfully. You ignore the kid who falls down as he tries to catch the bus he missed again.

The work day is hard. A string of numbers sits stagnant on your screen. Your mind elsewhere, lost in the memory of that white cat. Your boss interrupts you to ask you how those numbers are looking.

You tell him it's coming along. You knew you should've done your usual response, but you couldn't muster the feeling.  
 That panic rose up again when he just stared at you, mouth slightly agape. His eyes empty of all thought.  
 Then as the terror you feel starts to claw at you, ripping open your very mind.... Your boss laughs like usual and walks back to his desk. Your panic, gone.

Lunch was easy, you enjoyed a small prepackaged salad from the grocery store. It was your last one of the week, so you had made a note to get more the next time you were at store, always needing to go to the store. You took a bite, the crunch was satisfying to hear.

The end of the day came to a close, and as you went to get into your car you realized you left your keys in the office. One of these days you'll remember to grab them.  
Back home again you tried to relax. You were hungry, but the thought of eating made you want to hurl. You paced the living room, back and forth as you tried to figure out why you felt so...off. Like a train that had gotten off its tracks.  
You sat down on the couch, and took out your phone. Only to set it to the side as you realized that if you didn't eat, you would get a headache.

You went straight to the freezer, digging around for that frozen dinner that you heated up and ate in silence. Afterwards, you stepped back out onto the porch.   
The sunset was beautiful, a perfect orange-red backdrop for your favorite bird to fly across. Oh, you hoped with every fiber in your being that it did in fact come to visit you.

The hawk flew over your head, bringing a smile to your face and you watched it circle and then fly off into the distance. You actually started crying at the sight.   
The rest of the evening was spent cleaning up, putting off the laundry that was always full off, and just turning on your tv for background noise before you crawled back into bed. Your alarm wasn't set, it was the weekend.  
The weekends always passed by so quickly it's almost like they didn't happen.   
As you fell asleep, thoughts of the small breaks in the mundane loop you had found yourself in tried to pry you open. You pushed them away quickly, reminding yourself.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! )

I was multi-dating (first dates) with 4 other guys and for some reason, my interest was only for Tyee. Like I kept comparing the other men to him. 

He's attractive to me, Id say 8/10, and my anxious attachment has NEVER been triggered since he's attached and a good communicator. He also has a degree in software engineering.

The only problem is that he is in a few thousand dollars in debt because he got scammed by a job posting and his current job pays like $40k/yr. We are in NYC where you need a minimum $80k/yr to have a decent lifestyle. He was also behind 2 month's in rent. So that forced me to end up paying for dates like rollerblading, dinners, and gas. He did pay for some small stuff like coffee or dessert outings. We've been on 9 dates so far in a 1 month span.

  
For reference, I take home like $130k/yr and I own a home in another state.



TDLR: Guy is super attractive and good for my anxious attachment. He has ADHD and I suspect might be on the autism spectrum. I am tired of going back to the online dating market because its like a repetitive job interview process and I only find about 2% of the male population physically attractive. 

Do you think I should stick around and give him a chance to see if his situation improves? aka settle for a bit? Don't want to be caught up in the ""grass in always greener/there are unlimited options"" mentality

About product recalls and withdrawals

If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). The FSA issues Product Recall Information Notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems associated with food. In some cases, a 'Food Alert for Action' is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers.

After 4 years and 2 pregnancies (I am 4 months postpartum), I am going to try to lose this weight, especially my mommy ""apron belly"". I just can't take it mentally or physically anymore. I don't feel like me. I am nearly unrecognizable. My confidence is gone. My mentality is lazy, and I am NOT a lazy person. At the beginning of my motherhood journey I was a very fit 98 Ibs, personally perfect for a 23 y/o standing at 4'9 ft. Now at 27, 1 am very noticeably bigger at 160 los and can barely carry my weight, run, or walk up staircases. Even cleaning the house is more than I can bare sometimes. I recently found out my BMI is 35. Class 1 obesity, and that was my final straw.

The plan is to cut out a lot of foods I eat now, drink way more water and only tea otherwise (maybe an occasional coffee once a week) count calories, take an hour out of my day for exercise, and just stay active. My goal is 3 months, hopefully -30 los (Just in time for my class reunion)

The problem is that 1. I'm unsure how many calories I should even intake. 2. I've been hunting for exercises for my stomach (my biggest concern since it literally hangs out the bottom of all of my shirts), but I don't know if it's enough or if they are right for my body. 3. I'm not sure what to use to detox, because there are so many supplements, medications, teas, and other body cleansing products that are just scams.

-the truth
-""woke"" shit? So...freedom of speech, democracy, trans people (is it because it means more people could beat you in a race? No really I'm genuinely asking. I am supposedly the snowflake who is so sensitive and scared. What is so scary about trans people?), being made fun of, tampons in bathrooms (because you might get tempted to use one? I'm genuinely asking. Not trying to cause problems here!!!), women having rights, people of color having rights, poor people having rights, (I see a theme here! Aaaw it all stems from a fear of losing power! He's just a wittle baby.  

His ego is SO fragile (how fragile is it?!)

Then sections for different groups, people who are DEMOCRAT/Non Republican/left leaning)
Teachers, medical billing, multimillionaires (a section to ROAST them, because none of them would dare write anything! Or aren't against Trump.), lawyers, judges, police officers, kids, teens, 

Crucial points: end of opening act ""well that is enough from us, your ""woke"" opening act.

Let's give it up for the MAIN ACT, the true MVPs of the night. (I knew we could get them involved by calling them that!)..give it up for my Republican homies! 

Lets go back to good old fashioned ""football team hating"" each other. ""My team is #1"", ""no mine is!"" As watch game together or get beers together after. 


(Side note to person who reads: here's where it gets interesting. The main act COULD mean the current administration, OR add your own ideas below, please only if you are Republican/conservative/right leaning) .( This is a bipartisan effort, you see!)

I have a huge issues with this setup. If anyone qould be able to help me, I'll be happy to buy you a cup of coffee or a pint of beer.

User sends multiple files via n8n web form and create the name for the Folder.   
Code node creates binary files visible for Google Drive node to upload them into specific folder.   
If user's named folder exists already, Google drive (upper branch after IF/Else) has to move sent files into it. If not, create one and the move all user's files into newly created folder. 

I have spent all day fighting with this workflow and now I give up. The code node has to be right after n8n form node. Then GDrive node that uploads files onto drive. Then I have a node that search for the folder named by user in the form and get ID of this folder. Then IF node: if such name exists -> branch 1 - just move upladed files by ID into this folder. IF not -> branch 2 - Gdrive node Create Folder -> Gdrive node Move uploaded files as before. I've played with that in multiple ways and keep getting errors.

  
If I move nodes in other way I can't reach files from web form (getting errors) or cant move them within Gdrive. For some reason then I get error about my credentials.

It works perfectly for single file sent via web form, but not for multiple files.",2,1740238274.0,n8n,0,1.0,False

It turned out to be a day in hyperspace.  It was a long day for Vincent.  A long day in the cockpit, which despite his cleaning smelled of vomit and citrus.  A decidedly unpleasant day for anyone with a keen sense of smell, but Vincent didn't want to take chances with an amber calc.  It got worse when the scents of cooking meat wafted into the cockpit from his galley.  He was a little surprised that the kids didn't expect him to do the cooking.  However, that idle thought didn't last long in the face of the clashing scents.  Worse, well, not that much worse, when they finally did drop into realspace, it was a completely safe translation.  So, he set the autopilot to maintain a stable orbit of the local star, and headed to the galley to partake of what had created the incongruent sensations and desires in the first place.
 
He entered into an, well, an interesting scene.
 
""Tran cooked it for you, so you're gonna eat it.  We double checked the ship's database, and we know it's safe for you,"" the George boy was saying as he pointed sternly at Stowaway with his fork.
 
""What if I don't wanna eat it?"" the Corvian boy rejoined with affronted puffed-out plumage.
 
""Because if you don't eat it, I'm going to put it in a blender and pour it down your throat like you're a little hatchling.  So what's it gonna be?  Are you gonna eat your dinner like a big boy, or do I need to make you eat like a baby?""
 
Vincent decided to hang back in the shadow of the corridor leading to the cockpit to watch things play out.  Besides, it had been years since he'd dealt with that kind of thing.  Decades.
 
""You really think you can do that wannabe Lost Boy?""
 
Vincent was thinking about stepping in when the George boy said flatly, ""Yes.  I think I can do exactly that, and God as my witness you are getting enough to eat so long as I have anything to do with it.""
 
Stowaway glanced toward the girls at the table for support, found none, narrowed his eyes at the George kid, and started eating.  ""Whatever,"" he mumbled into his fork before taking a bite.
 
""Smells good,"" Vincent said as if he hadn't witnessed the exchange.
 
""Thank you,"" the girl, Trandrai, said shyly, ""Vai helped.""
 
""A little,"" the Lutrae girl mumbled as Vincent strode toward his dinette.
 
""We dished you up already, Mister Vincent,"" the George kid told him politely as he indicated a plate on the table next to Stowaway's seat.
 
Vincent slid into the dinette and began to cut into his slice of some kind of pan-seared red meat.  Probably something of the bovine variety.  ""Been meaning to ask,"" Vincent began carefully, ""why are you calling him Stowaway?""
 
""Mainly 'cause I couldn't think of anything better in the moment,"" the George boy admitted soberly, ""His real name's translation is too long.  Don't worry, when we know him better, I'm sure someone will come up with something better.""
 
""Well, what is your long name?"" Vincent asked the Corvian boy.  He couldn't believe he liked being called a stowaway all of the time.  ""We could just try shortening that for now.""
 
""Shut up,"" the kid muttered, which surprised Vincent more than a little.
 
""Apologize to Mr. Vincent right now,"" the George kid said firmly, but not unkindly, ""You have no cause to talk to him that way, and you are a guest on his deck.  Act like it.""
 
""Sorry,"" Stowaway muttered, and was likely inaudible to everyone but Vincent.
 
""Forget about it, kid.  I know better than to touch a sore subject.""
 
""Speaking of names,"" Trandrai softly said, ""what's her name?""
 
""Whose name?"" Vai, it was definitely Vai, Vincent would have to remember that, asked.
 
""The ship's of course,"" the George boy said, and shot a meaningful glance his way.
 
Vincent paused with a morsel poised to enter his mouth and blinked.  Hadn't he told them?  He cast his mind back and realized that he hadn't.  Odd.  Or maybe not, he couldn't remember having such talkative rescued hostages for a while.  ""She's called *The Long Way,*"" he said before popping the meat into his mouth.  It was delicious.
 
Jason didn't exactly believe in omens, but he didn't like the sound of that name.  It seemed foreboding to him.  He could see the question forming behind Trandrai's eyes, so he laid a restraining hand on her shoulder while he asked instead, ""Any idea on where we are, mister?""
 
""None yet,"" Vincent said, ""looks like there might be a world with a breathable atmo, fresh water, and maybe some game in-system, but we'll need to get closer to get a decent read. We're a couple of light-hours away, so I'll have to run an in-system calc.  Shouldn't be a problem.""
 
""Water?"" Vai asked brightly, ""Enough to swim in?""
 
""Maybe,"" the old shaggy man answered, ""but I don't think you're picking up what I'm putting down here.""
 
Jason sighed ruefully, ""*The Long Way* has no clue where we are, that means we're in uncharted territory.  That means the pirate ship rode that coreward current nobody's used since before the Axxaakk Dominion War, and we found out that there might be someone unfriendly lurking where it leads.""
 
""Pretty canny, kid.""
 
""I can add two and two without coming up with six,"" Jason said as he gave his meat a forceful stab.  ""Saints provide that we're close enough for your nav computer to cross-reference sensor data with predictive charts.""
 
""Could take some time, and with a current like that, there's no telling how far coreward we wound up,"" Vincent said carefully, ""so we could be together longer than I was expecting.""
 
""Aye,"" Jason said as he tapped a cut piece of meat on the edge of his plate, ""I figure we could stretch out the food we have for about a month.  Game would help us out.  You got a basic toxscanner on board somewhere?""
 
""Yeah, I have the standard first aid systems,"" the old man said, and his tone was so patronizing that Jason wondered whether he remembered that he'd specifically asked them not to root through his things.
 
""Well, not all of us can survive on a meat heavy diet,"" Vai said while she tried not to let her tail slap the bench beside her.
 
""Aye,"" Trandrai said with a comforting smile sent her way, ""that's what the toxscanner is for.  Any game is probably gonna be okay to eat, but finding safe fruits or vegetables could be tricky.""
 
""Set down and split up?  A hunting team and a foraging team?"" Jason asked as he leveled his gaze on Vincent.
 
""I'll handle the hunting,"" Vincent said bluntly as he pointed at Jason and Trandrai with his fork, ""you two are spacers, and probably haven't ever been on a hunt,"" he pointed at Vai, ""you have stubby legs, and if the game is on land you'll have trouble keeping up,"" then he pointed at Stowaway, ""and you just scream city boy.  I can handle a hunt on my own, it's not the first time.  I'll leave finding any edible plants to you four, if there are any.""
 
Jason wanted to object and tell the grumpy old coot that he had in fact been on several hunts planetside, but he figured that the other three would need someone to look out for them on an unfamiliar world, so he said, ""Aye mister, sounds good.""
 
""Good.  I'm coming off of a long shift on the bridge and that chase.  I'm wiped.  I guess the lot of you need sleep too, so we'll get some rest before we go take a closer look.""
 
Jason added, ""I don't know about the rest of you, but I could do with a shower.""
 
""Damn!"" the old man snarled, ""I don't have any changes of clothes for you!""
 
""We noticed before we took off from the hanger,"" Trandrai started saying, but she continued before trailing off as Jason gave her hand a gentle squeeze under the table, ""that's why Jason and I found…""
 
""Don't worry mister,"" Jason said quickly, ""we already figured it out.""
 
""Oh,"" the old man said lamely.
 
""Stowaway, you first,"" Jason said.
 
""Why me?"" he said with bourgeoning affront.
 
""Feathers, you'll need the most water to get clean.""
 
""Oh,"" he said, echoing Vincent's lameness.
 
""I guess it's me or Mister Vincent next,"" Vai said softly.
 
""I'll shower after I sleep, you're good kid.""
 
""And me last,"" Jason said with a hard look at his cousin.
 
""But…"" she began, and he hardened his look, ""… fine.  But you… fine.""
 
""This is good, by the way,"" Vincent suddenly said, ""the dinner.  Good cooking, thanks.""
 
Trandrai's skin blushed lilac and squeezed Jason's hand for comfort under, and Vai groomed her whiskers while both girls mumbled their thanks, so Jason returned the squeeze and said, ""Yeah, good job girls.""
 
""Food's okay,"" Stowaway grumbled, ""thanks.""
 
Then one shower per kid later, Jason was trying not to be irritated with Vincent for letting him sleep on the deck the first couple of nights when he saw that the old man had somehow folded the dinette down into another bed.
 
Vincent thudded his forehead against the reflective cabinet door gently and ignored the broken old bastard looking back at him as he reached down to pluck up a bottle at random.  He needed sleep.  He needed to quiet the memories to find that sleep.  The cheap tequila was cold on his tongue as he threw his head back to take a long pull.  There was a muted thud as he flung himself onto his bed.  These poor kids were stuck with him for too long.  He was pretty sure it wouldn't be good for them.  He sat up and took another pull.  Sleep.  He needed sleep, not to think about how much some other man's son reminded him of his Cal.
 
One black out later, and he was rubbing the sleep out of his eyes to the sounds and smells of bacon frying.  He recalled that he wasn't alone, made sure he was decent, and blearily shuffled his way to the shower to let the hot water wash away the dregs of his fatigue.  Once he'd seen to all of his morning hygiene needs, he entered the galley to find he'd once again been served his meal.  Bacon with pancakes and a mug of coffee.
 
""I didn't find any milk or cream when I put the food away, so I figured you take it black,"" the George boy said mildly as he sipped at his own steaming mug.
 
""Soooo jealous,"" the kid's cousin moaned at him with a glare, which he responded to with a smug grin.
 
""Yeah, good guess,"" Vincent said as he sipped at it.  He decided against his usual additive.  Landings can be tricky.  He looked over his charges, and found that they had indeed found changes of clothes so he asked, ""Where are you keeping your clothes?""
 
""In some boxes in the girls' cabin,"" the George kid answered, ""since we didn't figure on staying longer than a week or so.""
 
""Yeah,"" Vincent said, ""That room isn't used much.  Feel free to clear out the drawers and cabinets.""
 
""Thanks mister,"" Vai said brightly.
 
""Not you too,"" Vincent moaned.
 
""Huh?""
 
""He thinks he's not old, and calling him mister makes him feel as old as he is,"" the George boy mock whispered to her.
 
""Are you sure he's okay in the head?"" the girl asked while the deep bass clicking of Corvian laughter permeated the room.
 
Vincent scowled at the group, ""Well, I'm not that old.""  They only looked at him in reply.  ""I'm not!"" he reiterated hotly.  They offered no response, so he stomped off to the cockpit to run the calcs to jump to the planet, grumbling about kids these days all the way.
 
Jason watched the grumpy old man stomp off to the bridge and then poured the man's coffee into a travel tumbler before following him.  ""You forgot your coffee,"" he said as he shook the tumbler so the hot liquid within would slosh enticingly.
 
""You scrubbed it down again,"" Vincent said as he reached out and accepted the beverage.
 
""Aye mister, I figured it might help with the smell.""
 
""It did.""
 
Jason hesitated for a moment, then took the copilot's seat again, ""Sorry if that hurt your feelings.""
 
""Forty-eight isn't that old,"" the old man grumbled.  Jason didn't say anything.  ""Shut up, kid.""
 
""I didn't say anything,"" Jason pointed out as he carefully kept his face blank.
 
""You were thinking it!""
 
""You gonna get sore after me for thinking things, mister?""
 
""Jesus Christ.  No.  No, I'm not.""
 
""You oughtn't take the Lord's name in vain like that,"" Jason said mildly.
 
""Or what, kid?""
 
""Or nothing.  You just oughtn't.  I saw your Rosary, I know you keep the faith.  Green calcs.""
 
""Translate whenever you're ready, kid,"" Vincent said as he pinched the bridge of his snout.
 
""Aye mister,"" Jason said as he did as bidden.
 
The swirling rainbow colors of a hyperspace translation filled the main viewscreen once again, followed by a brief flash and a lonely pale blue and green orb hung in the void before them, and Vincent took the yoke in hand.  ""You got those kids falling in line there, kid.""
 
Jason keyed the sensor array to take preliminary atmospheric readings and answered, ""I don't catch your meaning, mister.""
 
Vincent began a low orbit of the planet below and let the silence sit between them for a while, and Jason made no effort to fill it.  ""I mean you seem like the leader.""
 
Jason considered that for a while in more before he said, ""It's not like I'm trying to boss everyone around.""
 
""Didn't say you were.""
 
""What are you saying, mister?""
 
More silence sat between them.  ""I guess I'm saying be careful.  Like the business with the Corvian boy.""
 
""His name translates to 'Yet Another Has Come Into the World.'""
 
""Fuck.""
 
""Aye.""
 
""You know about their names?""
 
""I've met all kinds of folks aboard the *Among the Star Tides We Sing.*""
 
Vincent answered with a low whistle.
 
""Not that one.  She's still entombed in orbit of Terra herself.  Our *We Sing* is a passenger liner in the spirit of the namesake.  It's an old Star Sailor tradition to not let a ship's name die.""
 
""You're a man of two worlds, kid.""
 
""I'm a George.  Comes with the name.  I really couldn't think of a better name in the moment, kind of let the name down then.""
 
""Don't start down that way, leads nowhere good.  I know.""
 
""Aye, mister.""
 
The silence stretched between them, and one by one the other children began to file into the bridge to satisfy their own curiosity.
 
""Mister Vincent,"" Jason began hesitantly, ""I get it if you don't want a Republican letter of marque.  A lot of CIPpers don't like dealing with the Republic…"" he trailed off trying to find the right words.
 
Jason saw Vincent check the display on the sensors he'd set up to check for atmo before he asked, ""You ever think about why that is?""
 
""I try not to let it bother me.  I figure everyone has their reasons, some good, some bad, some silly.  What I'm gettin' after is… why not do privateering work with the CIP uh… doesn't someone do something like a letter of marque?""
 
""Why do you care, kid?""
 
This was even more difficult for Jason, so he rekeyed the sensors to look for a good, stable landing site before he slowly said, ""Well… because you seem like a good guy…"" he shot a glance at Vincent and saw his raised eyebrow, ""not like that.  I just mean a guy who's good.  I figured out the whole shades of gray thing by the time I was seven.  So… good guy… but my dad says it's important to do the right thing the right way…""
 
Jason felt a supportive quartet of hands on his shoulders as he turned to meet Vincent's inscrutable gaze as the man asked, ""You think that if I was a guilder the rescue would have been better?""
 
""No, mister.  I don't mean that.  It's just… what do you do if you make a mistake?  Kill the wrong person?""
 
Stowaway flapped his wings and clicked his beak before asking, ""Who cares?""
 
""They're pirates, not people.  Not once they go under a black flag.""
 
""Mister, do you think you can't make a mistake like that?""
 
""Kid, I don't owe you an explanation.""
 
""No, mister.  You don't"" Jason agreed soberly.
 
""Just… trust me kid.  You think you know about the shades of gray already.  Things don't get any clearer as you get older.  Some ways, and in some places those shades of gray get a lot darker.  I have my reasons, kid.""
 
""Aye, mister.  None of my business.""
 
""But,"" Trandrai began to say, but Jason patted one of her hands and she fell silent again.
 
""This site here is close to a river in a temperate zone.  I figure on it being a pretty decent shot for our goals,"" Jason said.
 
""Oh good,"" Vai interjected, ""there might be fish!""
 
Vincent eyed the George boy in a sidelong glance.  He was a persistent kid.  Persistent, and earnest, and far from the stuck-up entitled brat he had expected.  There were a lot of ways that he reminded him of his own Cal, and more ways the kid was completely different.  Still a kid, still a boy who's in trouble, further from home than either of them hoped.  ""Good work, kid,"" he gruffly grunted, and was rewarded with a thin smile from the boy.  ""It'll take me about an hour to set down, so you kids go get ready to do your bit.  Feel free to catch fish if there are any.""
 
""Aye, mister,"" the George boy said and gathered up the other three with a look.  The Stowaway boy hung back for a few seconds, but joined the other kids once he realized that setting down wasn't going to be interesting to watch.  Vincent thought that the kid might have wanted to say something, but he didn't press him.

When I set up my bed, I pulled the blanket from our old bed out of the bag and I was hit in the face by your scent. I needed that about as bad as I needed you. So I wadded up that blue and grey blanket I bought years ago that we slept under..

I just stood in that empty room and cried into it. 

I crawled on to that air mattress with my teddy bear and your squishmallow. I put on Dragonball after listening to your voice from a few videos and dozed off. I dreamed of you. I could almost feel you in that bed with me and that was the best sleep I had in a month. 

I just want to go home. 

But where is home? That's the big question. I feel like home is that blunt and coffee with our pictures on the cups at three in the morning. That hot shower when you got home. Our matching muumuus. home is you brushing my long hair and telling me how pretty I am when I've had a bad day. Or rubbing my fluffy sock feet and giving me encouragement when I'm having a bad day. 

Home for me is where I hear your voice and I smell your scent and feel your body heat against my chest while I hold you because I know you like being the little spoon. 

I feel displaced and I am going through it. I need you. I miss you and there's nothing I can do about it. I wish you didn't hate me as much as you act. I'm sorry I did what I did but I don't know a restitution to make it better. 

I just want to go home and my home is wherever you are. I love you. I am sorry. 🥺 My sweet husband. How can we fix this?

Also wanted to discuss other similar instrumental rock genres and get everyone's thoughts on what and where I need to be looking. I say this because many of the main bands people seem to mention and regard as the post rock staples miss the mark for me a bit. Seem to be either too abstract, too slow, or have too much vocals for my taste. I prefer no vocals. Minimal at most.

Post rock bands I've loved:
------------------------------
City of the Lost- got me into the genre. Bit of a metal vibe which I love. Also a bit classic rock sounding sometimes. HUGE discography. 

Distant Dream- love love love every album. So good. Just wish there was more. Love the hard rock style. 

Those Who Ride With Giants- a real cool vibe. Can be too slow as the day goes on and I get to my 2nd and 3rd cups of coffee, but amazing for the morning. Fantastic for the first song of a mix.

If the Trees Could Talk- another really cool vibe. Enjoyed every album. Maybe a tad too abstract/slow once I'm awake and focused on work or gaming just like Giants but a bit less so.

Glaston- loved the two albums I've heard: I am whole and sailing stormy weather. Similar to last two where they're best early in the day when I'm afraid to get overstimulated. 

--

Post metal? Not sure the genre for these:
------------------------------‐-------------
Animals as Leaders- holy fuck I love this band. It's like if Deadpool made music. Maximum effort. They cram so much sound in their albums it's amazing it's even tolerable, let alone fantastic. 

Chainsaw for Birthday- is a nice blend between the post rock bands above and Animals as Leaders. Love every album.

John Petrucci's solo album is fantastic. Played a hole in that.

--

Psychedelic rock? Also not sure what these classify as but love them:

Ozric Tentacles- can't say enough good things about them. These non post rock bands are a easy way to overstimulate, but if you're looking for some trippy, energetic music, they're the creme de la creme.

Liquid Tension Experiment- similar vein as ozric, not as consistent. 

And then Joe Satriani, and Nick Johnston who seems heavily influenced by Joe. Joe was my first exposure to instrumental rock and opened my mind to what can be done with a guitar.

I am a little concerned in how it sections off the kitchen but I was also worried about there being a chaise right next to the outside door.

Also, any ideas on what the heck to put on that long ass wall behind my sofa? Was thinking about a hutch or arched cabinet of some kind to house coffee, etc on the left corner near the kitchen.

Also thinking about putting a console behind the sofa to not have the back facing the entrance, more decor and to lessen the space my cats can destroy

Thoughts and confirmations lol?

Please ignore the mess and everything else lol still very much a work in progress. Only been in the house for 2 months. The little console behind the sofa is a placeholder to make sure I have enough room for one.

Our goal is to become larger than life.        

Throughout history we have observed moments that in hindsight that left us wondering “why didn’t they act? They still had time. They had so many opportunities”. I studied these types of moments throughout my life and most of the time it was because they were waiting for someone else to act. We are living in our moment and the time is here; it is 11:53. It will be bad, it will be hard but we do not have a choice. We now have to speed run a revolution and they are betting that we can’t do it. I bet we can and it’s because of who you are.

Our fellow American’s are waking up to this fact and people are realizing something is wrong. We are gaining momentum and it’s time to capture it.     

If you find yourself waiting for your opportunity, this is it. If you’re someone who wants to help but can’t be mobile or can’t afford to go to March 4th, if you’re reading this then you can still help. I don’t believe I’m the person for any moment (and I don’t want to be) but I have a plan and it’s not perfect but it’ll help us achieve three things: Control the narrative, recruit, and build up with call to actions for the March 4th event. Bonus: data collection.         


My post background is in grassroots leadership/marketing, digital sales leads, and with an MBA in Marketing and Economics. I’m a parent who writes this while my child watches PBS and I drink my coffee. Just like many of you, last night my spouse and I had a difficult conversation that we may have to give up everything our families sacrificed to build and everything we have built because of the actions of a coup. If I’m going down, I’m going down loud.        


Our Goal: To become larger than life.

 

Our narrative: 1) There is significant evidence of election tampering found by Independent Agencies. (Plausible deniability)

2.) The United States has turned its back on it’s democratic allies and is now only allies with communist countries Russia and China. (Fact)      

 *provide sources*

Our method: We are going to email every new station/newspaper/publication/online local blogs in our respective area. The approach will be to email each journalist at the station with the goal and ask them why they are not investigating #1 and not reporting #2 and signing off with a Call To Action.

The goals are simple: get eyes on the what is happening and create conversations inside the station. We don’t have to hit 100% for a positive impact we just need a few to jump on board for it to catch on like wildfire and others will follow. We need to get the March 4 message in front of as many people as we can and sharing our discoveries will help people understand what is happening and why they should go to March 4th. If it’s not mentioned on the noon news/posted, politely follow up. Share this initiative with your city/towns/state subreddit. Recruit, recruit, recruit. I’ll include a script to use as an example below.

 

Next: Take this same message to content creators that you’d expect to cover this (example: Philip Defranco), then take this to content creators outside of the political sphere and ask why they haven’t spoken about it.      

This can be done quickly by anyone from your couch. We need increased visibility and the more people learn about this the quicker we can grow.        

 
Please work organize in the comments and take it to telegram after. We want to show we are organizing but nothing more. If someone feels off, immediately expire the group and keep it moving without that person. I will be making follow up posts for guerilla marketing for March 4th, voting for who we will identify as our political leaders (we don’t care if they accept – we are appointing them) to hopefully hand this off to and hold accountable, representative outreach, outreach to the wealthy, etc. Everything that we do is to get as many people to the March 4th protest and gain support.

 
I need help creating a secure survey to use for those fired by DOGE asking these questions: Age, Gender, Religion, and who they voted for. I have the theory that voter data is being used in these decisions to ensure they have a loyalist. We need to report our findings.

I’m begging you to bring your experience and share it. Digital marketers, data specialists, organizers, large social media following, content creators, access to politicians at any level, former FBI/CIA, I beg you to please help in the comments or message me or someone in the comments because this is it. This is our moment to make a difference for those kids that are enjoying their breakfast this morning, for our worried spouses, our neighbors who disagree with us, for Ukraine and our friends in Europe. It sounds so small but we just have to get to the one correct person to make that impact and that person is you. We are not here for decorum or midterms.. we want the gates.        

 

If you can make it to Iowa City today please go, even if it’s standing in the parking lot.       

 

Lets not shit the bed too bad.. just everyone is counting on us. I love you, guys.       

 

 

 
 

(if this sucks, someone with better experience rewrite this please)        

[Anchor name], I noticed in your stations news coverage that there hasn’t been any reporting of the independent findings regarding voter suppression or of The United States sudden pivot from Democratic alleys and are now allies with communist Russia and China. Many of our local citizens may not have access to other news outlets and are relying on stations like yours to educate them on what is happening and being reported around the world but not here in the states. I’m asking you to consider exercising your civic duty as an investigative journalism to look into this further and report findings if there are any. The American Public has a right to know what is happening.     

 

The citizens of this country are relying on you.

1ivkwnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ivkwnd/automatic_installation_of_triton_and/,Automatic installation of Triton and SageAttention into Comfy v1.0,"**NB**: Please read through the code to ensure you are happy before using it. I take no responsibility as to its use or misuse.

**What is it ?**

In short: a batch file to install the latest ComfyUI, make a venv within it and automatically install Triton and SageAttention for Hunyaun etc workflows. More details below -

1. Makes a venv within Comfy, it also allows you to select from whatever Pythons installs that you have on your pc not just the one on Path
2. Installs all venv requirements, picks the latest Pytorch for your installed Cuda and adds pre-requisites for Triton and SageAttention (noted across various install guides)
3. Installs Triton, you can choose from the available versions (the wheels were made with 12.6). The potentially required Libs, Include folders and VS DLLs are copied into the venv from your Python folder that was used to install the venv.
4. Installs SageAttention, you can choose from the available versions depending on what you have installed
5. Adds Comfy Manager and CrysTools (Resource Manager) into Comfy\_Nodes,  to get Comfy running straight away
6. Saves 3 batch files to the install folder - one for starting it, one to open the venv to manually install or query it and one to update Comfy
7. Checks on startup to ensure Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools are installed and that cl.exe is in the Path (needed to compile SageAttention)
8. Checks made to ensure that the latest pytorch is installed for your Cuda version

**The batchfile is broken down into segments and pauses after each main segment, press return to carry on. Notes are given within the cmd window as to what it is doing or done.**

**How to Use -**

Copy the code at the bottom of the post , save it as a bat file (eg: ComfyInstall.bat) and save it into the folder where you want to install Comfy to. (Also at [https://github.com/Grey3016/ComfyAutoInstall/blob/main/AutoInstallBatchFile](https://github.com/Grey3016/ComfyAutoInstall/blob/main/AutoInstallBatchFile) )

**Pre-Requisites**

1. Python > [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) , you can choose from whatever versions you have installed, not necessarily which one your systems uses via Paths.
2. Cuda > AND ADDED TO PATH (googe for a guide if needed)
3. Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools > [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

[Note ticked boxes on the right](https://preview.redd.it/cq2k1xyiepke1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e145be127864b54d9c62deef313bc2a79c82660)

AND CL.EXE ADDED TO PATH : check it works by typing cl.exe into a CMD window

[If not at this location - search for CL.EXE to find its location](https://preview.redd.it/j2p8eo9mepke1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6793c11aa174547fbf7f4a3b663160e35677a939)

**Why does this exist ?**

Previously I wrote a guide (in my posts) to install a venv into Comfy manually, I made it a one-click automatic batch file for my own purposes. Fast forward to now and for Hunyuan etc video, it now requires a cumbersome install of SageAttention via a tortuous list of steps. I remake ComfyUI every monthish , to clear out conflicting installs in the venv that I may longer use and so, automation for this was made.

**Where does it download from ?**

Comfy > [https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

Pytorch > [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cuXXX](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cuXXX)

**Recommended Installs (notes from across Github and guides)**

* Python 3.12
* Cuda 12.4 or 12.6 (definitely >12)
* Pytorch 2.6
* Triton 3.2 works with PyTorch >= 2.6 . Author recommends to upgrade to PyTorch 2.6 because there are several improvements to torch.compile. Triton 3.1 works with PyTorch >= 2.4 . PyTorch 2.3.x and older versions are not supported. When Triton installs, it also deletes its caches as this has been noted to stop it working.
* SageAttention Python>=3.9 , Pytorch>=2.3.0 , Triton>=3.0.0 , CUDA >=12.8 for Blackwell ie Nvidia 50xx, >=12.4 for fp8 support on Ada ie Nvidia 40xx, >=12.3 for fp8 support on Hopper ie Nvidia 30xx, >=12.0 for Ampere ie Nvidia 20xx

1ivkvqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1ivkvqy/how_we_built_a_500_techbusiness_maker_community/,How We Built a 500+ Tech-Business Maker Community in 60 Days (Without Selling to Each Other),"Two months ago, I made a simple Reddit post. It wasn’t an ad, a launch, or a request for upvotes. It was an open invitation.

The idea? A place where **entrepreneurs, indie hackers, developers, designers, and digital marketers** could connect—**without** the usual ""networking"" gimmicks. No one was there to **sell**, ask for support on Product Hunt, or farm followers. Just pure, **organic** networking for people actually building things.

# 🔥 The Digital Networking We Actually Needed

The world has gone remote, yet most online networking still feels... off. LinkedIn is a pitch-fest. Cold emails get ignored. Twitter threads are more about clout than collaboration.

So, we set up something **different**:

✅ 3 professionals per call  
✅ A structured conversation (not just small talk)  
✅ A chance to **understand** each other’s work, goals, and how we could help

No forced ""value exchange""—just **real** connections.

# 🚀 A Scrappy Idea Turned Into a Mini-Startup

At first, it was all manual. **An email list. Google Calendar. Spreadsheets.** Every week, we matched people up and scheduled video calls.

But as more people joined, **things broke**—scheduling became a nightmare. So, we hacked together a simple platform. That **primitive** system quickly became a full-fledged product.

And most importantly, it **became a real network**—not just usernames or followers, but actual **faces** of people who’ve spoken, shared ideas, and helped each other.

# 📈 The Snowball Effect—How the Community Became High-Value

This is where things got interesting. The Maker Meet community started **naturally supporting** each other:

✔️ Becoming the **first clients** for each other’s products  
✔️ Giving **exposure** through word-of-mouth  
✔️ Making **introductions** to potential clients & partners  
✔️ Even **co-founders** started meeting through it

It turned out that when **no one was aggressively trying to profit immediately**, **everyone** ended up benefiting long-term.

# ❌ The Big Problem—And How We Fixed It

Growth wasn’t all smooth. As we scaled, **meeting attendance dropped**—too many people signed up but didn’t show up.

The fix? A **small subscription fee** (literally the price of a coffee). It acted as a filter: **those who weren’t serious left**. And suddenly, the meetings were **high-quality again**—people showed up, engaged, and **actually followed up**.

# 💡 The Takeaway for Founders & Makers

1️⃣ **Build something people actually need.** Maker Meet started as a response to a real frustration—bad digital networking.  
2️⃣ **Start small, move fast.** We didn’t wait to perfect a platform—we used whatever worked (emails, spreadsheets, manual scheduling) and built only when necessary.  
3️⃣ **Community first, monetization second.** The best products **create** value before they capture it.  
4️⃣ **Not all growth is good growth.** Charging a small fee kept engagement **high**—sometimes, **fewer but better users** is the way to go.

# 🎯 Want to Be Part of Maker Meet?

We’re still growing, and we’d love to welcome more serious **tech-business makers** into our space. If you’re an entrepreneur, indie hacker, dev, designer, or marketer who values **genuine** connections over transactional networking, **you’ll fit right in**.

1ivkvld,https://www.reddit.com/r/moraldilemmas/comments/1ivkvld/what_should_i_think_what_is_the_right_thing/,What should i think ? What is the right thing,"Today, I took the train to travel far away just to have a coffee and leave a note, not even sure if she’ll read it… What madness, if you ask me.

My mind tells me it’s madness, sure, but I can’t help but believe. I can’t bring myself to accept that this couldn’t be a beautiful story… The story of a girl who ignored a boy who loved her too much, and who, over time, realized the effort and suffering he endured for her… Until she finally joined him in a park, the address hidden in a scented note left on a whim, the exact spot concealed within a beautiful poem… That she would meet him, and the two of them would kiss in silence among the trees, sealing a moral of forgiveness and sincere love.

A fairy tale, if you ask me… It’s far more likely that this girl will sleep with another guy, out of pure lust or just to forget… Forget that this boy once lost it because he felt alone and anxious… That she sees this ""too loving"" boy as a psychopath stalking her… And that, in the end, instead of meeting him, she never shows up… And he waits in silence, only to go home and hang himself.

Life is fascinating. One story, two scenarios… As many possible endings as there are thoughts to imagine them.

In the meantime, I wonder what she’s thinking. What scenario is playing in her head? Such a different vision… I was never given a chapter in her thoughts, so all I can do is speculate.

Anyway, I had things to say about this strange situation… I’m stuck between my love for this girl and the pursuit of a fairy tale, between calming down so I don’t scare her… Without wanting to forget her, because I still care… It’s all too complex, when in reality, all it would take is an open-hearted conversation. But all I get is silence… I’m starting to think that walls could talk.

I guess lack of communication is humanity’s greatest curse, the root of conflicts, wars, and murders…

**PARTY ROLL TO BEAT:** 11

Steven **18**  
Matt **2**  
Dusty **?? But Parties**

**The Good boys, being Steven and Dusty, have a proper party, with biscuits, strong orient tea and a good laugh at some adult novelty playing cards. Matt, being the Bad Boy, hangs around a bus stop and harasses the folks with his lewd language and views on farm animal segregation.**  



*Back to the Story !!!*



*We're outside the mayors house.*   
*For a moment, the party was actually decided on stealing the dress. Holy shit. Can you imagine that?! lol*

*Instead, Cuspertin wises up and thinks we should just ask the mayor for the dress and save us the hassle.* 

*Of course we are greeted by the lovely maid who sweeps us in and asks us what she can do for us.*  
*Frawd flat out says that they need gifts. Oh boy...*  
*He then fumbles it further, asking for the maids dress inadvertently. Oh geeeeze*

*Nigellius, being the leader of our group, always had been, always will be, allows Frawd to continue this exercise, hoping it will built the boy some confidence. Which it does! Because Frawd slings together some nice precise words about what they need and why....BUUUUUT he's said all of this to the maid...not the mayor...who's out and about in town. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh*  
  
*The maid takes our party towards a door, as if she's dealt with stupid people before and knocks on the door. Inside is the mayors wife and a hoarders dream of dresses.* 

*We are introduced as 'Brine boys'.  a deep cut. Frawd takes point on this....and well....he picks up where he left off and almost fumbles everything, that is, until Nigellius, using Mr Caw, hands Frawd the note with the measurements and such.*   
*Like a harmony of verbal chaos, each party member starts talking about why they are there and what it is that they need. The mayors wife is confused.*  
*All he cares about is the people's happiness, so if this handing over the dress thing can do that, she'll gladly help.*  
*The mayors wife looks at the measurements and notices that they are almost identical to the dress. Meow baby, mmmmmeow.*  
*We are allowed to borrow the dress, if we bring it back undamaged.*   
*All we gotta do is get the dress ourselves.* 



*So there we are....a rag tag bunch of guys, who don't believe in knocking, who are horrible at snooping, that have nearly died in EVERY house they have entered in (but one)....and the mayors wife has allowed us to roam free in this place....OH DEAR.*

The chair behind the desk is comfortably padded and has the symbol of a roaring bear stitched into its back cushion.""*** *- DM Mark*





*Nigellius thinks its wise to rifle through the drawers of this desk he surely does not own.*  
*There are three drawers. There's stationary and thick books that represent tax records going back several generations.* 

  
*We leave this room but find much of the other doors to be locked. That is until Frawd decides to lockpick one of them*

**Frawd,** roll sleight of hand to pick lock the door  
**14**  
*He picks the lock! the tumbler kicks and the door opens at his touch and......DOLLS....The room is full of porcelain dolls, some look better than others in terms of fashion, but they all resemble Ireena....*  
*OOOOoooOOooOOoOOOOO CREEEPY.... guess we found the mayors hench mans room.*



**Frawd**, roll investigation on the Doll room  
**NAT 20!!!**  
*Scouring the room, Frawd finds some empty wizard of wine bottles, there are some empty jars and every doll has the 'Blinksey' tag on it.*  


*Cuspertin peeks his head into the neighboring bedroom.* 

>***""This handsomely appointed room contains a canopied bed, a low bookshelf, and a full-length mirror in a wooden frame on the wall across from the door. Set into the north wall is an arched window of leaded glass. Nothing here seems unusual.""*** *- DM Mark*

*The room is normal. Pretty normal*



*We go to walk out and on the way, check the last door remaining in this room, but the door is locked. We hear a muffled cry for help behind the door.*



**Nigellius,** role a vibe check   
**20 something**  
*We are feeling the vibe that this is a distressed cry*



*Cuspertin reminds the group that we're here for the dress. Nigellius didn't expect to be in this situation at the mayors house. The plan has slightly changed now. Firstly, lets grab the dress then check out these muffled cries for help behind a locked door.*



We head into the dress room

>***""This room smells of powder and fine perfume. A vanity with a mirror stands against one wall next to a faceless wooden mannequin wearing a white bridal gown. Mounted on another wall is a full-length mirror with a gilded frame. A door in one corner leads to a garderobe."" -*** *DM Flavor Flav Mark*



*We get the dress and head back to the locked door, hoping Frawd can use his lock picking skills to get this door open.*

**Frawd**, roll sleight of hand to pick the lock  
**~~??? Fail~~**  **re-roll, using inspiration from winning the party roll**  
*~~The lock pick fails and breaks in the lock.~~*  
**20, success**  
*Even with the lock pick broken inside, Frawd's nimble fingers get it out and he manages to pick the lock with the remaining parts.*

  
We open the door....

>***""Chained to the back wall of this otherwise empty closet is a badly beaten man wearing nothing but a loincloth. The iron shackles have cut into his wrists, causing blood to trickle down his hands.""*** *- DM Mark*



*Frawd removes his gag and offers him some chocolate. The man looks beat the hell up. He says his name is Udo, a shop keep that's been arrested for protesting at a festival.*   
*Our party inform Udo that we're personal friends of the mayor and that a slight against him is potentially a slight against us. HOWEVER....since we are compassionate, we'll talk to the mayor into getting Udo released.*  
*Udo wishes to be leave now, maybe we pick the locks for him or break em? But we're not about to ruin our friendship with the mayor right now. We still need this dress, we still need to get outta this house and we still need to finish this quest; without the help of others like the Mayor, we would be shooting ourselves in the foot.*   
*Seeing as Udo has no leverage here, we tell him that we'll talk to the Mayor and see what we can do.* 

*We close the door on Udo and head out. Yeah, we're not gunna take on an added side quest while already in a side quest, even if this guy is stupid.*  
*Heading downstairs, we run into the maid who lets us out and we go back into town towards the tailor.*

  
*hustling back, we barge in with the dress, plop it on the floor and the tailor tells us it should be a couple of hours, but she'll have it done. We play it safe and stay inside the entire time until shes done.*

*A few hours pass, our party just stares deeply into each other eyes and don't say anything.*  
*The tailor speaks up and says the dress is done. The cost? 2 gold. What a fucking rip off. Thankfully the Abbott gave us money.* 

*Its about midday, we could always head back to Krezk, should take the rest of the day into the evening, barring no random encounters. But we decide that since we have time on our side for once, we'll head back into the town proper, gather any supplies we need and move with the bleak sun come morning.*  
*On our walk, we keep an eye our for the Mayor, who was said to be out and about. It would be the best and only time we can talk to him about Udo.*

**Nigellius**, roll perception to see if the Mayor is anywhere around them

*WE SPOT THE MAYOR! Flanked by his twin hounds and the creepy bodyguard that likes dolls with Ireena's face on em.*   
*The mayor is going door to door like a Jehovah witness, informing them of the new festival coming up. Participation is not voluntary, it's demanded.*  

*We beeline towards him and approach the mayor. Once again he is delighted to see us.*  
*As a group, we do a poor job at trying to soften the Mayors stance against Udo. While we tell the mayor that we just left his house to pick up a dress, we didn't outright tell him that we broke into a closet, found  a shackled man and talked to him. We just tell the Mayor to go easy on Udo. YEAH...*

*Oh! We call another audible and decide not to stay in Valakey, but instead travel a few hours back to Krezk.*  
*The familiar road is kind to us, as no random encounters happen. By the time we reach the gates of Krezk the sun has begun it's journey down and night creeps in. The town feels tense.*

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

(posting for a friend),"My friend (32M) refuses to get a reddit log in but is worried that they were an asshole to this person Mary McDonald Lewis (71F), we'll call her MM for the remainder of the post. I've never done this before so please let me know if I have to block off names. Mary is a public figure and fairly famous so, it's already out there. Anyway Jack (my friend) said that they were worried that may have caused her to have to cancel her play and refund tickets. They did a whole post on tumblr because no one follows them and felt like it was a safe place to vent the argument. That said now they're less worried about it being found out and more worried that they caused a huge commotion and caused this woman to have to cancel and refund the tickets to her play.

Post to original tumblr link: [https://www.tumblr.com/jack-wess-wolf/773606739619758080/mary-mcdonald-lewis-do-you-ever-realize-your?source=share](https://www.tumblr.com/jack-wess-wolf/773606739619758080/mary-mcdonald-lewis-do-you-ever-realize-your?source=share)

So here's a slightly shorter version of what happened. A poll was going around the local backstage theater group.

# Poll: Should including the [PAID] tag in job posting be reserved for Legal Jobs?

# Vote

1.""Paid"" should mean ≥ $0.01 distributed to the actor, regardless of work asked of them.  
2.""Paid"" should mean the job is legal and providing a W2, treating the actor as an employee, and paying at least minimum wage.

MM's response was:

Mary McDonald-Lewis  
Interesting poll! I see the votes are close at this moment. I’ll look forward to the results.

Regardless, the rule that dollar amounts must be included in posts for job opportunities here has caused us to market our crew and actors’ positions elsewhere. Though we pay, on average, more than most theaters, we don’t agree that our budget is for public scrutiny, and believe it to be the purview of our company, and applicants.

We have no objections to the rule or to others agreeing to abide by it, of course. We simply hire elsewhere.

MM

In which someone (P1) asked:

What is wrong with pay transparency?

Another person (P2) stated:

Mary, when you elect to obfuscate your pay rates it signals to professionals that you are either paying too low because you can't afford it or paying too low on purpose to be predatory. You are also wasting your colleagues' time and energy by forcing them to have to ask you how much your pay is. What happens when someone takes that time to ask, and then your rate is unacceptable for them? Now your time has been wasted too. What happens when a hundred people ask your pay rate and none of them like it? That's a lot of time wasted answering people's inquiries and you're no closer to finding your cast and crew. Frustrating, right?

Save everyone's time, energy, and instill confidence in your future collaborators' by posting your pay rates upfront. Besides, if you're so sure your rate is higher on average than most theaters you should be proudly posting it on every call! I guarantee it will expedite your process and everyone will be a lot happier.

The attitude of ""we simply hire elsewhere"" is antithetical to the collaborative nature of theater and the arts. Where does that end? Over time more and more markets will be demanding pay transparency to avoid time wasting and predatory employers, so eventually you won't be hiring anywhere.

MM's response with P2:

1. We pay more than most.
2. You are free to do as you wish, so are we.
3. “The attitude of ‘we simply hire elsewhere’ is antithetical to the collaborative nature of theater and the arts.” — this makes no sense. Marketing our positions online in other locations is the same as marketing here, except that we can do it following our own ethos. There are plenty of other places to reach theater workers — don’t we want to reach them there, too?
4. I support your right to post whatever company information you wish anywhere you wish. That’s how it works in a democracy. You may, or may not, return the respect. This is your right, which I also support!
5. I can’t understand the fearful and angry responses, when I seek to defend everyone’s right to do their thing. Again, I urge you: market your work as you will. I’ll be first in line saying “Go, you!” I will not, however, whether the same respect is returned or not, stand in any line that doesn’t line up with my beliefs.
6. I wish you big luck on all your projects.

\-----

P1 reiterates the question about pay transparency. And MM responds with:

Nothing, for you and everyone else who agrees with you. Totally cool. I’m all for it. Great idea. Go for it! I will stand with you to defend your right to do this.  It’s just not for me. See how that works? You get to do it, I don’t have to: yay democracy!

Jack chimes in:

My 2 cents is that, I think pay/no pay is fine for the listserv.

HOWEVER, I do think that pay should be listed somewhere accessible even if it's just on the company's job listing website. Even if the pay ends up simply saying, tip splitting depending on performance, at least people know what they're getting into. It makes it easier for people who are trying to make ends meet and simply saying ""pay"" does not help. Some people can't waste their time chasing jobs that in the end won't pay enough to cover rent when they could have sorted them out.

In the end you're hurting the applicants, and simply wasting your own time.

\-- At this point in time after writing their opinion Jack has caught up on reading what was going on above and asks everyone to take time off as it was getting heated above their comments.

MM responds.

I completely support this group’s rules, and its reasoning, 100%. I understand it, I’m in favor of the decision as it is a group one, and I’m glad the group arrived at this through the democratic process. It should continue to operate in this manner, and I’ll always defend a group like this’s right to define their rules and regs.

P3:

Wants to a little more information on who ""we"" is that MM was talking about.

Jack (like an idiot, granted information research is part of their job) immediately does some digging and answers the question to the best of their ability not knowing that minutes before the post (to be clear and my friend wanted to stress this, *it is not a live chat they have to refresh to see new posts*):

Red S Theater. They're new. Registered official in December of 2024. Putting on their first show The MacBeths at Milagro. Three points of contact. Only person registered by name is  Mary Mcdonald-Lewis, the other two seem groups or compnaies: Spiral Stage Theatre Group and  Story Federation.

Not knowing that MM had already responded with:

Oh, just me and my little VO projects. I occasionally help out for film/tv projects, or am asked to pass along references in my scope as dialect coach for same.“Mary McDonald-Lewis” is the name of my company.

But upon seeing that immediately posts a follow up:

Ah looks like Mary answered with a more accurate answer.

MM then starts going after him.

Hi guys,

Sorry Jack, Red S isn’t the company that’s making the following statement. I am:

**1. I agree that pdxbackstage should operate by whatever rules it wishes. I stand in defense of any and all decisions made by the group!**

**2. For my personal use, I find other places to post jobs without listing pay in the initial post, though I do in follow-up enquiries.**

Story Fed is my own non-profit, purchased from Spiral about a decade back. To re-iterate: no one at Red S is involved in my position here. If you need to more about me:

(to be clear MM then proceeds to give her personal home address along with her number, which Jack has stressed to me that we are NOT doxing her even though she doxxed herself).

Mother of 1. I live alone. No matter what you do, I stand in your defense to hold your opinion.

Jack of course apologies (confused):

Yeah, you used ""we"" so the assumption was it was whatever company you were representing not just you. Mary McDonald-Lewis does not appear to be a registered company .My apologies, I reacted too soon with incorrect information...

And then asks for come clarification:

I would... uh... like to point out that putting your address out there is an interesting choice. I hope it's not your personal address but Red S Theater is... registered to that address too.

What did you mean by us"" when you said ""has caused us to market our crew and actors’ positions elsewhere"" if you didn't mean your company.

Sorry if I'm going too far. I'm now just confused about wording and logistics.

MM then responds like this:

Oh no worries. Your enquiries are not unanticipated, so let me re-iterate, in case there’s any misunderstanding: I will always stand with any group’s rules and regulations arrived at democratically, as this group has done, and support any theater’s choice to post pay. This is in fact my home address, provided to satisfy your curiosity about my personal/professional life, and both of my non-profits are listed here, where I live alone on the ground floor.

The first, Story Federation, gives me an opportunity to provide theater companies a non-profit to use for their own storytelling purposes, should they lack one and need one for their projects. I’ve had that one for years and it has been used by others for this purpose.The second, (Jack has it on his long page on tumblr but I refuse to give this woman a way to exploit her sister), is a non-profit used to provide support and care for my developmentally delayed, elderly, medically fragile sister, for whom I am the sole caregiver.

(Insert 2nd charity) takes up most of my time these days, other than my work as a union voice actor and dialect coach. (Her sister's name here) is ill with Parkinson's, and is now facing eviction and homelessness, more of which can be found here, as you are interested in my doings.

I have had several theater companies through the years, but on the “pay” question, I’m referring to the aid I provide film/television companies seeking voice actors, and occasionally, on-camera actors. After 40 years in the business, production companies often ask me about actors with animation skills, but more often, dialect skills. My IMDB is terribly out of date, but you can get a sense of my activity there, which stretches back nearly half a century now. I have a job shooting in New Zealand now, *East of Eden*, that I coached, and I’m watching *Going Dutch* now, another project of mine, featuring an Aussie actor rocking a fine US accent. Did you catch *Eileen*? My actors there really got the Boston accent down. I was very proud of them. The “we” is more often than not just me, but sometimes I get an assist from my little team — accountant, agent, lawyer — on some of these projects. If you need their names I’m sure you can google them, as you have done so well today.

I’m hoping that expressing my opinion here doesn’t result in too many more personal questions nor encourages a belief that answers can be demanded, especially as I’ve stated from the beginning that I think it’s great that folks follow the rules here if they support them, and that this group has a right to its rules. Go, rules! I’m truly all for them. 

Jack, if I have satisfied you, that would really make my day.

If not, you have my address, come by for a coffee with the rest of your questions and we’ll see what we can do about them.

With great respect and complete support,

MM

Jack's response:

Nope no questions, I was just concerned that it was your personal address (which you did not need to share). I'm more adverse to people knowing my home address and I'm happy you feel both comfortable and confident enough in yourself and in strangers on the internet with knowing these things, even if it is a local and closed group.

All I asked was for clarification as a company is also registered there. The information I gave when I was just trying to answer a question about who ""we"" was referring to and was using the best information I could find readily (and freely) available. Which I will admit I jumped the gun on and did say that you provided more accurate information in response to the other person's question.

I will point out all you had to do was say that they are separate entities, which you did (in longform). I was just confused on what you meant by the ""we"" and ""us"" in your first post because it is registered to the same address which indicates that it is run by the same people and asked for some slight clarification as that original post implies that the ""we"" and ""us"" looking to hire elsewhere would apply not just to you.

That said, I didn't ask for further information than that (perhaps *I* was too vague on what I wanted for clarification) but you volunteered more than I asked for.

I will admit, it feels like you're talking down to me, and I do apologize if I seemed to slighted or insulted you in any way to invoke that reaction.

Her response:

Jack,I have appreciated this discussion for many reasons, not least of which because of all the many, many fine points made by Rusty and lots others, which demonstrated very thoughtful reasoning and was rich food for thought.

No apologies necessary.

I simply sought to resolve your confusion comprehensively, so as not to draw out what surely cannot be interesting to this entire audience here any longer than it absolutely had to, and I hope I’ve done that.

You have all my contact information should you have more questions. Maybe offline would be a good venue for this.

\-- to be clear my friend is NOT going to go to their house because that's--

1. Crazy
2. Has had experience with actors like this before and absolutely refuses to be put on the spot like that
3. Is not white and could very well be accused of trespassing and is not a risk they want to take.
4. Doesn't feel safe going there, and can't act to save their life so if something DOES happen, they're afraid they'll read as suspicious and not be able to prove otherwise.
5. They got a private email that let them know MM was a shit stirrer and apparently has a history of doing it (Jack's not on the listserv much because he only really use it to glance through possible gigs when he has free time between full time work, or to give away tickets, he has a season subscription and is sometimes out of town).

But there was an update they got last night and they had a hard time sleeping over the guilt (thus this post):

Last night they got this from the listserv:

Subject: I Mary McDoncald Lewis

TO THE THEATER COMMUNITY:

THE MACBETHS IS CANCELLED.

I, MARY MCDONALD-LEWIS, am no longer associated with Red S Theater company, and Red S Theater company has been dissolved. I have taken this step with contentment, commitment, and understanding.

Doren Elias, Jane Bement Geesman and the cast and crew of THE MACBETHS and the fantastic Milagro Theatre are wonderful people who care deeply about diversity, equity and inclusion, and who support every aspect and facet of the LGBT+ community.

They are not in any way connected to me or to my opinions; in fact, they 100% support the recent concerns and for this reason have disassociated themselves from me.

Doren, Jane, the cast and crew and the entire staff at Milago are all 100% courageously committed to the protection of all marginalized people.

They have demonstrated this powerfully by asking me to leave the show and the company, and to dissolve the company itself. I am happy to comply.

I love the Portland theater community and support its right to free expression with my whole heart.

I wish the MACBETHS crew all good fortune for a fabulous show — it’s going to be a barnstormer.

All tickets will be refunded.

Good luck,

Mary McDonald-Lewis

\----

Which left Jack confused and a little concerned that they did something horribly wrong because they didn't intend to run anyone out of business (although that is theater and business for you that gets compounded into risk when it's both). They weren't aware anyone was avoiding going just that there were better and more interesting shows and events coming up. They pointed at the Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals happening in SE Portland, and the Fertile Ground Festival coming up in April.

He was a little concerned so did more research and found her Instagram page. Apparently... it has left him with some mixed feelings because he feels like it's his fault that this happened.

I don't think it's his fault, but he accusing me of being biased because I'm his friend. He can't control what people say or people's choices. But he can't help but feel it is he's the asshole for causing people who were working on that play to possibly lose their pay. They know how hard it is to get jobs in gig economy and try to take only volunteer ones for theaters they know treat their workers right, or as best they can.

Update:

Just got and update from my friend that MM has left the listserv. And now they feel worse.",0,1740235947.0,AITAH,5,0.33,False

I want to be as open and honest as possible in this post so it may be a bit lengthy. Bear with me if possible.

I am currently undergoing a lot of life changes, especially in terms of my fluctuating mental health issues, and trying my best to find my way in the world. During this time, I could use a friend, but I feel a bit burnt out trying to do so because a lot of times connections, especially online, are short-lived, fickle, and quite honestly, underwhelming. I think it's obvious that we are all here for *something*, be it a relationship, friendship, or otherwise, but connections tend to come and go for everyone. Well. I would appreciate a connection with someone interested in something long-term, consistent, and meaningful. No more adding someone on this or that app just to talk once or twice, and never talking again, or slowly losing contact. No random ghosting. No dry texting or back-to-back ""How's the weather?"" type of conversation. I mean, seriously, how often can you ask someone ""What's up?"" or ""How are you today?"" before it gets a little old? 

With this all being said, I would *love* to meet someone who, as I have said, would be willing to be in it for the long haul and dedicate time and effort to establishing and developing a friendship. My ideal person is *a*ny type of sapphic person. Fem(me), butch, masc, androgynous, lesbian, bisexual, it doesn't matter to me. *Everyone* is welcome. Roughly around my age group, the mid-20s to early 30s, preferably in North America, so there is no/minimal time zone difference, and interested in having an engaging friendship. Unfortunately, endless texting is not for me, and while I am down to text throughout the day and discuss whatever, whenever, I prefer bonding with others primarily through shared activities, specifically gaming, and speaking on the phone. Other than gaming I also enjoy watching shows and films, listening to music, and other types of activities, but I cannot keep up with someone who doesn't enjoy being in a call together. 

A little bit about me is that I am 25, bisexual, agender fem (AFAB), happily taken by a lovely individual, and from the Southeastern United States. Currently, I am a final-semester student pursuing an internship and expecting to graduate in May, after that, I plan to pursue a job within my field. In the meantime, I fill my free time and life with things that feel meaningful and special to me, namely dedicating time to my passions and hobbies, trying to develop healthy friendships and creating a ""found family"", advocating for myself as someone who is neurodivergent and psychiatrically ill, using my feminity to express myself, and finding peace and acceptance in witchcraft and Paganism. 

My main interests are collecting trinkets, the fine arts, reading manga/webtoons, animated series, watching an obscene amount of YouTube, alternative fashion, and missing 2014 Tumblr

As for gaming, I love all sorts of games, but my favorites tend to be shooters, simulators, story games, and horror survival. Some notable series/games I've enjoyed are Silent Hill 2, Alice: Madness Return, Catherine, and Coffee Talk. I can enjoy just about any game if the story is interesting enough, the graphics are pretty enough, or the lore is deep enough!

I would love to play the following games with people

* Overwatch 2
* Marvel Rivals
* Fortnite
* Evil Dead: The Game
* Apex Legends
* Back 4 Blood
* Phasmophobia
* Dead by Daylight
* Paladins
* SMITE
* Pokemon UNITE
* Splatoon 2 & 3

1ivkd6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheIdiot/comments/1ivkd6g/aiti_for_taking_an_ambulance_after_getting_hit_by/,AITI for taking an ambulance after getting hit by a car?,"Earlier this week, I (25M) was riding my electric scooter in the bike lane on a main road with no stop or yield signs when a car at a stop sign pulled out before I had cleared the intersection. I was going 35-40 mph and had less than 2 seconds to react before smashing into his car. I managed to slow down just enough that I hit his side door instead of being run over, but the crash still felt incredibly hard. I ducked slightly, so I think I hit his door flat before collapsing and sliding across the road instead of rolling over him.

At first, I was too scared to move. My chest felt numb, and I had sharp pains down the right side of my body from road rash. The first thing I said to a bystander who came over was, “Can you call my wife? I have epilepsy.” I have temporal lobe epilepsy with focal onset unaware seizures, and had missed three doses of my medicine as I couldn’t get a refill. Stress alone can trigger my seizures, but I also hit my head hard twice—once against his window and again on the ground—so I was worried about making it worse. I stayed down until paramedics arrived, who put me in a neck brace, strapped me to a board, and took me to the ER.

In the ambulance, they asked if I wanted pain meds, but I declined. When they debated whether to classify it as a trauma transport, I told them I thought I was okay and that there was no rush. In the ambulance, I was shaking uncontrollably, but I kept telling them I was okay. At the ER, they did CT scans of my head and neck, plus X-rays of my right knee and foot. Both were swollen and bruised, but not the worst pain I’ve ever felt—my seizures are worse to recover from. My neck is incredibly sore, but it’s not broken or bruised. I also didn’t get a concussion nor have a seizure before or after impact which is a miracle.

When the police took my statement, I explained exactly what I recall happened—that the driver stopped, then pulled out in front of me. The officer said my story matched three witnesses, whereas the driver claimed I had a seizure and crashed into him while he was still at the stop sign. When the officer asked how the driver could’ve known I had epilepsy, I explained that the first thing I did was hand my Apple Medical ID page to a bystander and ask them to tell the paramedics. If I did have a seizure, I would have still been unconscious when bystanders came up to me, and have no memory of a black Mercedes hitting me, not even remembering what year it is or where I was. It takes at least a full day for me to recover from seizures, and the ER agreed I didn’t have one.

I was discharged from the ER about six hours later with ibuprofen and muscle relaxers. The first two days were painful—my right side (arm, wrist, leg) hurt a lot, and the road rash was bleeding. But honestly, I don’t want a lawsuit or any legal fight. I just want to meet the guy for a coffee, make sure he takes stop signs more seriously, get my scooter and helmet replaced, and move on. However, in the ER, the cop told me this is definitely going to court, but that my version of events lined up with the bystanders’ much more than the driver’s.

Looking back, seeing only minor scrapes on my helmet but remembering how hard the impact felt, I don’t know if I overreacted. Given that my head slammed into the car, I was too afraid to move—especially in case a seizure started. I recall the bystander not sounding concerned when he called my wife, “Uh… chillin1215 had an accident” but I haven’t read the crash report yet. There’s going to be a lot of costs associated with this that I can’t afford.

1ivkcwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ivkcwr/the_future_of_ai_should_not_only_revolve_around/,"The future of ai should not only revolve around making ai a ""better teacher"" or a ""smarter helper"", but also focus on making ai a ""better student"" or an ""effective learner"".","I personally think that for many aspects of AI, especialy when applying it in highly uncontrollable environments (such as someone's house), or learning new things, the USER has to be the one that trains them, not the company that develops it.

To achieve this, I believe companies and researchers may need to develop a ""student AI"" that are capable of learning complicated things we taught them at an instant and applying it right away. In this way, we can interact with them directly, teaching them how to get used to its unique surrounding environments, and teaching them how to use new tools or do niche tricks whenever we want, without asking and begging the company for another ""AI update"". 

Take humanoid robot as an example, assuming that you just bought them and want them to make coffee for you, with the help of the ""student"" ai mentioned above, you can achieve this in the following steps: 1) turn on ""learning mode"" and speak to them: ""\[insert robot name here\], I am going to walk you through my house, please familiarise yourself with the layout. Now follow me."" 2) guide them through you house, introducing them to each room and the functions. 3) when in the kitchen, point at the coffee machine, and said: ""\[insert robot name here\], this is a coffee machine, I am going to teach you how to use it."" 4) you have two choices: either inputing a pdf or a video tutorial, or directly teach them by your action and words. 5) tell them to make one cup of coffee, and correct them if they make some mistakes along the way, until they can achieve fluency. 6) when you are thirsty, speak to them: ""\[insert robot name here\], make a cup of coffee for me"". Boom, done.

In short, what I want to express is that: What we might need in the future is a student ai, connected to a base model such as R1, O3, and one can modify and customize the ""brain"" according to their needs. The ai needs to be good at being your ""No.1 student"", and can get what you taught quickly and update its weights through the external materials you feed them or through your actions and words as input.

Some of you might say: ""Nah, I don't want to waste my time doing all that!"" However in my opinion, this might be responsibility that we eventually need to take to make ai more usable and applicable, just like we must spent time and money to learn how to drive in order to go to places wherever we want at a faster speed. Moerover, a ""student ai"" can encourage the democratization and open-source of ai R&D since now everyone can do it.

Of course, this ""student ai"" may sound a bit far-fetched for most people, however, as I have already seen it in its infant stages (chatgpt can now remember from something I wrote months ago, and apply it to new conversations), and as reasoning models, embedded learning models and visual learning models improving at a rapid pace, I think this is a feasible goal for the near future of ai.

What do you guys think? I would appreciate any comments that expand on my idea, or point out the flaws in my argument.

I have the following for sale;

*  Mahlkonig E65s GBW (black) $2,300 
* Mahlkonig E80s GBW (white) $3,200 
* Mahlkonig Mini Hopper $150 
* La Marzocco Linea Mini Brew-By-Weight Scale $350
* The grinders are new in unopened factory double box. 

Coffee is a bit of a hobby for me.  I'll often cycle through equipment every few months. I have plenty of references selling super autos in the $2k-$5k ranges. usually through market place.  

I'll often negotiate a discount and purchase before knowing which one I want and sell the other.  In terms of these Mahlkonig hoppers, I ended up not going with either for space constraints and the fact I use my super auto 98% of the time and thought I should just stick with a single dose.  It is time to get these out of my basement.  

Please note, these are not the grind by sync models. All the internals are the same but they do not have the wifi. I tested the grind by sync and they are a 100% gimmick play to add perceived value to LM and Mahlkonig grinders so they can charge more. IMHO.  It also give LM and Mahlkonig the ability to charge a licencing fee to other manufacturers if they can make the marketing stick. Just a FYI. 

I'm a experienced ecom retailer (not in the coffee world) and have very good UPS rates on heavy items.  I am happy to ship these but they are deminatally large and the  insurance value add about $11 per every $1k insured, so shipping could be an easily $140 cross country and $80 to spots in New england.  I'm happy to quote at the time. 

Payment would be cash and carry if you are local to north of boston.  For shipping I usually accept wire, we could do zelle but I'd just need to look into it first and confirm my bank accepts it.

Fast forward a couple of months, I see a couple of moths swirling around the kitchen but again they seem to be under control quite quickly. 

No sign of them until yesterday; none in the kitchen and also the pheromone trap is still up and empty. However, we have an open kitchen towards the living room. I was rummaging through my book shelf and noticed some maggots crawling around — first just a couple on the edges of the books, then flipped through more books and found them in the dust jackets of coffee table books and special editions with lots of foldable extras. Also, they were sitting in crevices of the attached cupboard where some spices and condiments had been stored (all cleared out now). The books are not damaged per se but they’re sticky with the maggots and I’m not sure how to proceed here. Most of them seem to be either dead or pupping, a couple were crawling around. 

What can I do to get rid of them but salvage my books as be as possible? Throw the dust jackets and clean the books off? Freeze the smaller books? Or throw the books away to be safe? ",1,1740235667.0,pestcontrol,4,1.0,False

1ivkaoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ivkaoo/how_to_get_over_bad_date/,How to get over bad date,"I'm a 30-year-old female and recently went on a date (let’s call him Jared) after being single for two years and not actively seeking a relationship. I met Jared at a concert when my friend ran into someone she knew, and Jared happened to be with that person. While my friend caught up with her acquaintance, Jared and I started talking. We discovered that we work at the same company but in different locations. He took my social media information, but I didn't think much of it at the time.

The next day, he started texting me, and we ended up chatting for three weeks straight. I found the conversations a bit dull because he never asked questions to keep them going. Whenever I tried to end the conversation by just liking his message without adding anything else, he would always respond to keep it going.

Eventually, we discussed being single in our 30s and how difficult it is to find someone genuine. After that conversation, he asked if I had plans for Valentine’s Day. I replied that I didn’t, and he said he did, but it was just to play golf with his friends. When I mentioned that I had never golfed before, he suddenly asked if I was free the following Sunday to golf with him. 

I wasn't sure if it was a date since we hadn’t really flirted or bantered over text, so I didn’t hold any expectations for the hangout. However, when we met up at the golf site, he was still awkward and barely acknowledged me at first, jumping straight into golfing. I felt very uncomfortable. 

To lighten the mood, I tried to act more extroverted, making jokes and asking him about his day. Eventually, it broke the tension, and at one point I noticed he was standing really close to me while talking, which felt more intimate, as if we were at a bar and feel like the only people there in a crowd.

However, things started to go downhill. I didn’t know if it was something I said or did, but the conversation remained surface-level, and I struggled to break through the barriers. At one point, he mentioned he was feeling really tired, which discouraged me because we hadn’t even been hanging out for an hour. He also brought up that he had planned to bring a friend along, but she bailed. This left me confused about whether this was intended to be a date or if I was just there as a friend.

And I truly promise that nothing in this duration had I said something weird. Truthfully we did talk about our hobbies and we both had different interests like how we don’t watch the same tv shows or how I like to go to the gym for exercise and he likes to play sports to exercise. 

After about an hour of golfing—much of which was spent searching for lost balls—it became clear that we didn’t have enough time to get to know each other. He didn’t invite me for lunch or coffee afterward to extend the day, which left me feeling disappointed. I spent the entire week stressing about this meeting, and I wish there had been clarification about whether we were friends or something more.",3,1740235629.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False
1ivkanm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ivkanm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wake_my_husband_up_anymore/,Aita for not wanting to wake my husband up anymore.,"I 26F have been with my husband 32M since 2018. In our seven years together we’ve had four beautiful children ages 5-1. I am a stay at home mom and have been either pregnant, breastfeeding or both at the same time since June of ‘18. 
He works offshore and is gone 2-3 weeks at a time and then is home for 5-10 days not including his travel days. I ALWAYS let him get as much sleep as he needs the first day or two after coming back home depending on if he was working nights or days. However after he’s gotten adjusted I too would like some help getting sleep. When I tell him I’d like to sleep in one day he tells me “Okay just wake me up first”. Doesn’t that kind of defeat the purpose? I have had night shift every single night since we first had kids. I can get at most four broken hours of sleep.  It’s frustrating but I don’t complain because I’d still have to get up to pump if he fed the baby. Or I’d have to wake him up a million times to even get him up to do whats needed and I’m up up at that point. 
I’d rather someone get good sleep so they can be more present with the kids and have the energy to do what we need to do. But then he still will not get up with the alarm, or after I initially wake him up but when he decides to get up several hours after (3-5hrs). 
I used to send the kids in to wake him up but normally ends in him fussing them to leave, making them really upset and then doesn’t get up or does but is pissed off about being woken up. That’s the other thing, he doesn’t even wake up ready to help. He completely dismisses the kids and treats them like crap until after he’s had his coffee and is generally extremely unpleasant to be around. 
Hearing him yell at them that he’s not doing anything until he’s had his coffee has awoken a new sense of rage that I’m struggling to contain. I cry to him so much about how tired I am and how much it’s negatively affecting me and how I could use even just a tiny bit of extra sleep. I can barely keep up at times. He swears he can’t control it but does for work no problem. Occasionally he will let me get a nap but then he wakes me up and passes out instantly right next to me for at least twice as long as I got. This week I’ve been sick. After a night of violently puking I told him he had morning duty and had to take the kids to drop our oldest at school.  he told me “Of course, no worries”.  I still had to wake him up after he snoozed the alarms. When he got up he left the wide awake baby in bed with me. He’s slept in every day since. 
I’m struggling to be in a good mood for my kids because of this. I cook I clean, I do the projects and activities with the kids. I struggle with postpartum depression, anxiety, have bad GI issues and have Premenstrual dysphoric disorder ontop of it.  I work on practicing my mindfulness as much as I possibly can and do yoga with the kids etc. I’m trying to take care of myself as best as I can so that I can show up like I need to and see things as they are and not as my mind can sometimes make them up to be. But this situation right here seems f*****. Am I being an asshole for not just getting him up or is this some pretty unfair behavior? ",4,1740235627.0,AITAH,24,0.83,False

## What to Look for ‌in ⁢an Optoma Mini Projector: Key Considerations

Before diving into ⁣specific Optoma projector reviews, it's crucial ⁤to understand the key factors that contribute to a great handheld projector experience.Consider‍ these elements when making your decision:

*​   **Brightness​ (Lumens):** Optoma ‍projector lumens are critical for ensuring a visible image in various lighting conditions. For dimly lit rooms, ⁢300-500⁢ lumens‌ might suffice. However, for brighter​ environments or larger screen sizes, you'll want to consider options with 700⁤ lumens or more. A radiant portable projector is essential for ‍maximizing versatility.
*   ⁤**Resolution:** The Optoma projector ​resolution‌ determines the sharpness and clarity of the projected image.‌ While WVGA (854x480) might potentially be sufficient for basic presentations, consider HD (1280x720) or Full HD (1920x1080) for sharper ⁤visuals, especially when displaying detailed reports or‍ videos. High-resolution is essential for professional applications.
*   **Connectivity:**‌ Modern Optoma mobile ⁣projectors ⁣offer⁤ a ⁤range⁤ of connectivity options. Optoma projector ​HDMI and Optoma⁢ projector USB ports are standard for connecting to laptops, tablets, and smartphones.Optoma projector wireless connection capabilities, including screen ​mirroring, are also highly desirable for cable-free presentations and easy content sharing.
*  ‌ **Portability:** the defining ⁣characteristic of a handheld⁣ projector is its size⁣ and ⁢weight. Look ‍for a compact projector ⁤that's easy to carry ‍in a briefcase or backpack. Consider the dimensions ⁤and weight carefully, especially if you're a frequent traveler.
*   **Optoma Projector Battery Life:** For ‍truly wireless ⁤operation, Optoma⁤ projector battery⁣ life​ is a critical factor. Evaluate how⁢ long the projector can run on a ⁢single charge and whether that meets your⁤ typical ‌presentation⁢ needs.Some models offer power bank compatibility for extended⁤ usage.
* ⁢  **Keystone Correction:** Optoma projector keystone ‍correction ‍is essential‌ for correcting distorted images when the projector is not placed perfectly perpendicular to the ⁤screen.Look for models with automatic keystone correction for effortless setup.
*   **Image‌ Quality**: Beyond resolution and brightness, image ‍quality depends⁤ on colour accuracy,⁢ contrast ratio, and overall picture processing.​ Optoma LED projector models often⁣ excel in this area, ‌offering vibrant colors and sharp details.
*   **Price:** Optoma projector price ​varies depending on the features and performance. Set a budget and prioritize the features that are most important to you. Weigh the long-term value against the initial cost.
*   **Warranty:** Optoma⁢ projector warranty provides peace of mind ⁤in case of defects​ or malfunctions. ​Review the warranty terms‍ carefully before⁣ making⁢ a purchase.

## Choosing the Right Optoma Handheld ⁤Projector: ‌A ⁣Decision Framework

⁢    *⁤   **Space Constraints:** Consider the available space ⁢for setting up​ the projector.​ Short throw‌ or ultra-short throw lenses can be beneficial ⁢in tight spaces.

3.  **Consider Connectivity Needs:**

## optimizing ⁢your ⁣Optoma Handheld‍ Projector Experience

Once you've chosen the right Optoma handheld projector, here are some tips for maximizing ‌your experience:

1ivk722,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1ivk722/just_a_random_story/,Just a random story,"In the vibrant heart of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where skyscrapers scrape the clouds and the city's pulse beats with ceaseless energy, lived Amir. With a head full of unruly black hair and eyes that once sparkled with the fire of aspiration, he embarked on his journey in the software and technology realm five years ago.
 
Chapter 1: The Glorious Beginning
 
The first year at the company was a whirlwind of excitement and discovery. Amir's days were filled with the hum of teamwork. In the open - plan office, the air was thick with the chatter of ideas. He and his colleagues formed a tight - knit group, spending long hours in front of their computers, their fingers dancing on the keyboards as they crafted lines of code. Each successful project was a cause for celebration. They would gather around the break room, sipping strong Malaysian coffee and sharing bak kut teh from the nearby hawker center, laughing about their coding blunders and triumphs. Amir felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be, on the fast - track to achieving his dreams.
 
Chapter 2: The Pandemic's Gloomy Shadow
 
Then, the COVID - 19 pandemic hit like a tidal wave. Overnight, the bustling office transformed into a virtual workspace. Amir found himself isolated in his small apartment, staring at a computer screen all day. The once - lively discussions turned into pixelated video calls filled with lag and miscommunication. The lines between work and home blurred, and the lack of human contact took a toll on his mental state. He missed the casual banter by the water cooler, the shared excitement of a new project kick - off. As the days turned into weeks and then months, a sense of loneliness and anxiety began to creep in, like a silent invader.
 
Chapter 3: The New Boss's Harsh Reign
 
When the world finally started to open up again, Amir returned to the office, only to be greeted by a new department head, Mr. Raj. Mr. Raj was a no - nonsense man with a reputation for being tough. From the moment he took over, Amir's world turned upside down. In his first project presentation under Mr. Raj's supervision, Amir poured his heart into explaining his innovative coding solution. But instead of praise, he was met with a barrage of criticism. ""This is amateurish at best,"" Mr. Raj sneered. ""I've seen better work from interns. You need to go back to the drawing board and fix these glaring flaws."" Amir's face burned with humiliation as he tried to defend his work, but his words fell on deaf ears.
 
From that day on, it seemed like nothing Amir did was good enough. Mr. Raj would nitpick every line of code, every report, every decision Amir made. The once - enjoyable work now became a daily battle, a constant struggle to meet impossible standards.
 
Chapter 4: The Descent into Darkness
 
As the months dragged on, the stress of work began to take a heavy toll on Amir. He started to show up to work with dark circles under his eyes, his once - tidy appearance becoming increasingly disheveled. Despite his best efforts, his work performance began to decline. The more he tried to prove himself, the more mistakes he seemed to make.
 
At the same time, Amir began to notice the undercurrents of office politics. Colleagues who were once friendly now seemed to be vying for Mr. Raj's favor, often at the expense of others. There were whispers behind closed doors, backstabbing, and false accusations. Amir, who had always been a straightforward and hard - working person, was ill - equipped to deal with this new reality. He felt like he was caught in a web, unable to escape.
 
In the evenings, instead of unwinding with friends or pursuing his hobbies, Amir would collapse on his couch, too exhausted to even turn on the TV. His sleep was plagued by nightmares of failed projects and Mr. Raj's scathing criticism. He started to isolate himself, canceling plans with friends and family. The smile he wore at work became a mask, hiding the deep - seated pain and despair within.
 
Chapter 5: The Final Straw
 
The fifth year was the most challenging of all. Mr. Raj called Amir into his office one morning, his face stern. ""Your work has been subpar for far too long,"" he said coldly. ""If you don't show significant improvement in the next month, I'll have no choice but to report you to the headquarters. You could lose your job.""
 
Amir's heart sank. He knew he had been struggling, but the threat of losing his job was a wake - up call. He threw himself into his work, pulling all - nighters, sacrificing his weekends. But no matter how hard he tried, it seemed like it was never enough.
 
One evening, after a particularly brutal day at the office, Amir walked aimlessly through the streets of Kuala Lumpur. The city, usually a source of energy and inspiration, now seemed like a cold, indifferent place. The lights of the Petronas Twin Towers, once a symbol of hope and achievement, now seemed to mock him.
 
He found himself at the edge of a quiet park. The sounds of the city faded into the background as he sat on a bench, his mind racing. He thought about his dreams, his family, his friends, and most of all, Laila, the love of his life. Laila had noticed the change in Amir. She had tried to be supportive, to listen to his problems, but Amir had gradually withdrawn from her, too ashamed to share his failures.
 
As the night deepened, Amir made a decision. He stood up, took one last look at the cityscape, and walked towards his apartment. Once inside, he sat at his desk and wrote a letter. The letter was addressed to Laila, his family, and his friends. In it, he poured out his heart, his struggles, his pain, and his apologies.
 
Then, he lay down on his bed, closed his eyes, and let the darkness consume him. The next morning, when the sun peeked through the curtains, Amir was gone, leaving behind a void in the lives of those who loved him and a stark reminder of the toll that work stress and office politics can take on a person's mental health.",1,1740235326.0,malaysians,1,0.67,False

She sat across from me, wide-eyed and cautious, still unsure of where she was headed. I could see the weight of self-doubt in her posture, the way she curled her hands around the cup as if grounding herself in something tangible.

“You’re still journaling,” she said, a small, knowing smile forming.

“Of course,” I replied. “More than ever, actually. Turns out, it became something bigger than just texts and photos in a blog.”

She tilted her head. “Bigger how?”

I hesitated, thinking about the Notion journaling templates, the people who found comfort in them, the slow but steady growth of something I built with my own hands. “I created something that helps others reflect, too. It’s not just about me anymore.”

She nodded, as if she’d always hoped for this but never let herself believe it. “And work? Did we figure that out?”

I took a sip of coffee, considering how to answer. “It’s… a process. We’re leading projects, making things happen. But we’re still learning, still navigating what comes next.”

She looked relieved—like she needed to hear that it was okay not to have all the answers yet.

“And the loneliness?” she asked softly, almost afraid of the answer.

I met her gaze and smiled. “It’s different now. It doesn’t disappear, but we understand it better. We don’t run from it—we write through it, share it, turn it into something meaningful.”

She let that sit for a moment, then grinned. “You always did like writing.”

“And you always wanted to create something that mattered.”

She glanced at her watch, reluctant to leave but reassured. “I guess I should get going.”

“Yeah,” I said. “But take it easy, okay? You don’t have to rush. You’ll get there.”

She stood up, lighter than when she arrived. “I’ll hold you to that.”

And just like that, she was gone. But she left her coffee cup behind, a quiet reminder that we’re still the same person—just further along the path.",17,1740235278.0,selflove,4,1.0,False

I truly love sitting on the patio just after a rainy night 

The dewy smell calms my nerves for the coming day and the wet leaves dripping it’s truly a sight

I like to walk barefoot through the grass beneath that big ol tree as I graze my feet 

I glide through the grass typically with coffee in hand there are few moments that are more sweet

When the fog looms over and fills the trees branches as the birds chirp 
People say I enjoy things like a monk and act like one too 

Some people’s bedroom are their world they never see nature and fill their minds with junk

but I don’t mind being myself instead of  hermit lunk

I always laugh at things like that as I bring my coffee to my lips to slurp

As I look to the trees I see the cardinals and blue jays singing their song in sweet harmony

While the squirrels look for nuts and seeds to complete their daily larceny

These mornings are indeed beautiful but what’s more so is what happens during these moments 

Everything from the trees dripping a nightfalls rain off its leaves to the birds in the trees

As the heated night rain falls and nourishes the trees the moisture collects and the air and cools and condenses as the cool morning arrives 

The dew from this Phenomenal act of nature then leaches into the soil to help the grass and plants survive

The birds play their part as they spread seeds around

The burrowing worms, rodents, and vermin alike do their part mixing the soil in the ground

All they require is a rain to pass to bring in a rushing river of nourishment for all life

They strive when they have little strife
These moments fill me with glee

Thought I'd share our experience. We drove a circuit from SJO- Bajos Del Torro - La Fortuna - Montverde - Jaco - Queopos - SJO

Frequent flyer miles for American Airlines tickets.

Three travelers – all around 60 yrs old from US.

14 nights – starting/ending SJO

Total cost $4,873 or $1624 per person

All lodging was either AirBnB or [Bookings.com](http://Bookings.com)

All lodging was at least 2 bedrooms 

Car was great, lodging all great and as advertised

Got the $100 Verizon international plan and it worked great

Car came with a cooler

We had all breakfasts at the lodging

We had sandwiches/chips/leftovers for most lunches

We went to local soda restaurants for all dinners

Often got boxes to go at soda restaurants- huge plates!



Route was as follows:

Arrived SJO at 12noon

Wild Rider picked us up and took us to their location. Professional

Car rental included all insurance

Pickup groceries at Walmart in San Jose

Drove to Bajos Del Torro – 1 night

Walked up the road to a soda restaurant – wonderful whole fried trout

Drove to Paos Volcano NP– fogged in but fun

Drove to Chinchino Waterfall park – medium-difficult trails

Drove to La Fortuna – 4 nights AirBnb

Walked to and ate supper at a different soda restaurant downtown each night

Drove to El Choyin hot springs – free to enter but we paid 2000 colones to parking mafia

Drove to Rio Celeste waterfall park

Hiked Mirador El Silencio park ($10 each)

Coffee at Metropoli Cafe – great coffee but no wildlife

Potholes!!! like millions!!

Saw the multitudes of wind turbines

Drove to Monteverde/Santa Elena – 3 nights AirBnb

Coffee/chocolate/sugar cane tour Don Juan – great!

Hiked Montverde Santa Elena Cloud forest

Did Jardin Orchid tour

Drove to Jaco

Stopped at crocodile bridge...not our vibe

3 nights Jaco high-rise condo Airbnb

Walked beach 3 mile one way/back

Relaxed by pool some

Hiked Rainmaker park – hanging bridges!

Drove to Quepos - Airbnb 2 nights

Took the bus to Manual Antonio NP – 75 cents each way!

(definitely take the bus – crazy parking there!!)

Drive back to San Jose for early morning flight.

1 night in Airbnb 5 minutes from airport

(If we were doing this again, I think we'd just stay in the nice condo at Jaco longer, take day trips from there and skip Quepos.  We were in Quepos to make it easy to go to Manual Antonio but seemed unnecessary after we were there).

A few years back I got a pretty bad breakup and got a panic attack in the middle of my countries (one of the) biggest shopping malls. I live in a small town, close to the capital, but like to.. or well, used to go out just eating and coffees and so on.   
This was almost 3 years ago, and it happened again. Bad breakup, panic attack, busy mall.

Its been 3-4 months now and I havent left the town. I dream about going to places, learning new skills, meeting new people, but.. well. I used to do martial arts and I consider that the best years of my life and I wanna do it again but I have to go out. Have to go to the city for that.

Its terrifies me to the bones. 

Starting therapy next week, I haven't got officially diagnosed yet, but I have a hunch it might be this phobia.

I have an idea that I want to get opinions on. I work as a barista and I love to travel, so I thought it would be a good idea to create a group to help match baristas with short-term work opportunities. For example, if I wanted to spend a few months in San Diego, and I needed work, I could use the group to find coffee shops who were interested in seasonal/short term employment.

Baristas would post their experience, availability, where they want to travel, etc. and coffee shops/hiring managers would post their location, hours, availability requirements, etc.

Would anyone be interested in this?

(Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Yes you read this right, we are in a polyamorous relationship, so this is not cheating. And no, polyamory is not the debate here. 



My primary and I got together in September ‘23, and started like every other relationship with lots of time spent together, really lovedovey stuff. At the time we got together, I already had another boyfriend, but only as a secondary, and a few playpartners (we are also into kink). 

One by one, I broke off a relationship after the other for different reasons, like I did not feel like I was a priority to my other romantic partner, or a playpartner demanded more of me, than I thought was fair etc, but nothing was my new primary partner’s fault. My primary also had some playpartners.

My primary started seeing a woman in February / March '24  I believe, and I think they got in serious relationship around May. After a while, maybe June / July, with them in new relationship energy and some incidents I felt neglected by my primary, I asked if we should end the veto mechanism, as I didn’t want to use it against his secondary, but I started to feel like I did not have any other choice. Either I would be able to at least talk to someone he vetoed before, or he might get a veto on her. He ended up choosing to end the veto.

A different thing we had was a call / callback option. If a partner was having a really hard time / emergency, we were allowed to call our romantic partner for help, and if a phone call was not enough, then a callback may be asked. A callback means that you call your partner home for comfort in your mental / physical emergency. 

I used one phone call in May and a callback in June (he did not come home, he stayed with her). In July the three of us met over coffee, so we could clear some air. She felt like she never got some quality time with our boyfriend, because it was always in between shifts (primary has a very complicated shiftplan), but so do I. But me and primary already have a plan with datenights once a week, and he has 2 weekends off work a month, where one is a 3 day period, the other is 5. I met her concern and offered her the 3 day period of weekend, which she accepted. 

I also explained that I felt they were meeting so often, to which she was bafled. She felt like she never got time with him, while I felt they were always together. And showed her June in my calendar as an example. She had been with him twice as much as me that month, because of our schedules. So I was asked what was acceptable, and I gave them a generous number of nights to meet (7 nights a month, which might sound little, but because of his shiftrotation that is quite generous). That should give her enough time with him a month, and I can keep my head in check (we shared a calendar, so I knew whenever he was there and thus could tell myself that “he is not more with her than me, don’t overreact”). 

His girlfriend also expressed feeling like I was sabotaging them, with my call / callback, and that I did not respect their relationship. I got baffled, because why the fuck would I suggest meeting over coffee with someone I did not consider my primary’s secondary, and moreover give her one of his weekends off. And I told her some of my struggles, and was very clear that I never intended for her to feel that way, I just need reassurance sometimes. The call / callback arrangement is also for her to use, of course. We kept the arrangement. I also specifically said that I felt hurt that my callback was not taken seriously, and that is the only thing I am asking. They seemed to be sorry and agreed.

After this meeting I felt we had an understanding and were getting closer, and hopefully more understanding of each other. I was wrong.

In September I called early in the evening as I was having a meltdown. The conversation was more accusatory and rushed and I felt unheard. Later in the evening we spoke again, this time I wanted a callback, but again he stayed since he had been drinking. That is fair enough, but I asked if he could come home the following morning, to which the answer was “I can ask, but this has become a pattern and is looking like sabotage”. He did not come home the following morning, and needless to say, I was floored. I afterwards went low contact with her. 

I expressed my feelings of her demanding more and more, even though I had already given her what she had asked for. I gave her a finger, but then she asked for the entire hand.

Primary expressed that he felt so stressed being between the two of us, when we did not get along, and that he felt that there was always some drama on either end. After he expressed this, I thought “okay I will not bring up anything anymore, and give you that space”.

Christmas is getting closer, and he confides in me with the problems with his secondary. I give him my objective advice about the situation, which quincidently is her asking for more and more. I did, after asking if he wanted to hear my personal opinion, tell him that I was kinda relieved to hear him complain about what I have told him for months. I actually got her a christmas gift (a treeornament from a franchise I know she loves and collects).

January ‘25 comes around, and my primary’s girlfriend has a surgery in the baginning/middle of week 4, where he has taken time off work to stay with her for the next 24 hours. He ended up staying for 2 days, and during that second day I had a meltdown and did a callback, my third in total, and again he didn’t show.

2 days later me and my boyfriend took a step back. We are no longer primaries. To me that means no moving in together, no marriage, and no kids together. It hurt me so much. He expressed that one of the reasons he wanted this is because he does not like that me and his other girlfriend are not speaking much. I expressed to him that I have tried and tried. I always gave her a finger, but she ended up asking for a hand. I also brought up that I only asked for one thing in return, and that was for the calls / callbacks to be respected. I also switched some weekends with her. She wanted the weekend in week 9 instead of week 5, and I was told that was because of her recovery. 

As of their entire relationship I have now used it three times, and she has needed 3 phone calls. Mind you, every time my primary has expressed that she needs a call, I am very understanding and gives him space to do so. But the other way around she apparently becomes mad for me needing the same. 

I feel like I have done everything asked of me this entire time, but feel like I am being punished for it, with losing my status (and kinda future) as primary. 

I did however do him a favor, and send her a message, to try starting communicating with her again. I had never gotten to know the circumstances about her surgery, as my boyfriend said that it is her information to share, and she had told him that if I wanted to know, I would need to ask her. This is of course totally fair. Our “break up” happened the Friday of week 4, and we had scheduled to be together again the following weekend, which is the weekend me and his girlfriend had switched. And I used that weekend as a good timing to send her a message. The message went like this;

“Hey! I just wanted to thank you for this weekend with *bf’s name*, since it ended up being needed more than expected. To my understanding you did not want this weekend because of recovery from your surgery last week. He never told me anything about it due to your privacy, which I highly respect. I also heard that it was okay for me to ask you directly. So; What happened that lead to a surgery (if it is still okay for me to ask)?I hope you feel better soon, and am sending warm thoughts”

My bf read the message and said it sounded nice, so I send it the following Monday. He appreciated the gesture. 

A few hours passed and got a reply.

“Hey,

It was more like of the two weekends I wanted the other one more, since I thought I would be more reduced so close after the surgery. So thanks to you for the switch.

Nothing specifically has happened that lead up to it, more like an opportunity that I have been working towards. Other than it being a bigger surgery which affects most parts of my daily life, I do not wish to disclose any further.

Thank you!”

Do not get me wrong, I have full understanding of her not telling me. I was just under the impression that she basically had told bf that I had to ask her and she would tell me, but when I do, I still get no answer, but shit happens.

I do feel like she said “ah no I just wanted the other weekend” and used the surgery more as a cover to guilttrip me. This is just adding to the resentment from feeling like I always do things for her, but never get anything back, and makes me consider going no contact. Do you have any advice?",0,1740234253.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

1ivjt0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivjt0r/i_had_an_honest_conversation_with_my_psychiatrist/,I had an honest conversation with my psychiatrist about how hard I try to look fine on the outside while feeling completely empty on the inside,"I usually try to keep the conversation really shallow and list symptoms that are getting better or worse but yesterday was different.

My psychiatrist asked me how I've been feeling for the past 4 months. I said I have been feeling pretty stable. She asked me what I mean by stable and I explained that I haven't felt any emotion really, no lows but no highs, I completely feel flat and empty. She asked me do I cry so I said I don't. It's been so long and I don't even feel anything that would make me cry. She asked me do I tend to be in my room a lot so I said yes, I shower after work and go into my room. She asked me whether I eat in my room so I said yes. She asked me if I even hang out with my family and I said not really, it's not that I don't want to, I just can't make myself be with people. She asked me if I communicate with people on work and I said I do in bursts, I keep very light-hearted persona, always smiling and chatting when people approach me or say something but I usually get back to being unresponsive once I'm left alone and I end up coming home very exhausted. However, lately I've been really quiet and I don't participate in conversations. I keep very functional persona on work, I try my hardest not to make a mistake but when I can't control it, I make mistakes for the whole day and I get scared I'm going to be let go and be replaced with no financial security.

Sure, I don't feel a lot when I'm awake but when I'm asleep I always have nightmares because that's the only time I process anything. I rarely feel as if I even slept despite sleeping for 6-13h.

She said she's concerned about me because it seems like I've been in this cocoon, not really expecting anything out of this world. I said it's true because I don't even find joy or anything positive out of stuff and that's usually why I struggle with even hopping into shower, washing my hair, making a coffee, eating, anything really because I don't see the end goal leading to positive feeling so I ask myself what's the point anyway. If the fear didn't prevail this feeling, I'd be a really unhygienic person.

She recommended for me to connect to people no matter how hard it seems and is because people are truly rotten nowadays, I have to judge correctly. I then realized I keep everyone at distance and I lost all connections I had with my friends. I cancel gatherings all the time. I feel like we don't click. I feel like we're at two different parallels so I can't be with them for long without feeling distance which makes the empty feeling even worse.

We changed therapy and she said she really wants me to feel better. I said I truly hope so myself because it's been a long time since I started attending therapy but I can't shake off the feeling that I'm getting worse in a sense that I'm falling deeper into the void like feeling.

I'm truly exhausted from this mask I'm carrying when I'm outside and I wish I could just be what I am. Maybe I'd finally accept that I don't feel well.",1,1740234174.0,depression,1,1.0,False

Something exciting to share from the workshop today - our seamed stockings are featuring in BBC's new drama ""Dope Girls"" (premiering today in the UK). It's a gritty, glamorous dive into London's underground nightlife scene right after WWI, when women weren't about to let go of their wartime independence.

https://preview.redd.it/05d52eaujpje1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b39e6385580025129acb1ce735f591a689e781f6

Here's a little insider detail I thought you'd appreciate: While the costume department chose our Coffee Seamed Stockings and Champagne with Latte Seam pairs to create that perfect period look, there's an interesting historical twist. Our seamed stockings are actually based on post-WW2 designs, as authentic 1920s-style stockings (which had very different construction methods) are virtually impossible to find or reproduce today. But the subtle elegance of our seams works beautifully to capture that hedonistic 1918 Soho atmosphere!

For our fellow vintage enthusiasts, it's a fascinating example of how costume departments sometimes need to make clever adaptations to create historical accuracy on screen. And honestly, seeing our pieces help tell this story of women pushing boundaries makes all those hours perfecting seam alignment worth it.
