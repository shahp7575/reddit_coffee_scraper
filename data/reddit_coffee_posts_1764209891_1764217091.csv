1p7slil,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1p7slil/thoughts_for_those_working_the_holidays/,Thoughts for those working the holidays…,"Allow me to share a few of the mantras I often share with my coworkers to get us through the irate and needy customers, long lines, call-outs, other short staffing, and overall chaos: 

**Your rage is sacred.** What I mean is, these bitches ain’t worth it. Please try not to allow  anyone or anything at Starbucks to bring out the worst in you. Strive for excellence and do your best etc, but when someone cant or won’t be satisfied, let your soul remain unbothered. It’s not personal. That’s a “them” problem. 

**It’s just coffee.** Don’t say this to a customers face lmao but just remember that whatever you do or don’t do should not have the power to ruin someone’s day. So if they start swinging insults or accusations, remember we’re just a beverage shop, and their problems are their problems. There is only so much you can reasonably provide. 

**The day will end.** This sounds ominous but it’s meant to be promising. No matter how long your shift is or how deep in the weeds you get, you WILL eventually be able to clock out and leave it all behind and go home to hopefully a decent meal and a warm bed. Nothing lasts forever. 

**Take care of yourself and each other, because the Siren sure as hell won’t do it for you.** If you’re lucky, your managers or your community will show some appreciation and care for you, but they probably won’t. You have to do it yourself. Move at a sustainable pace. Take breaks. Drink water. Stay fed. Uplift each other. Look out for each other. You’re all in this together, and you do no one any good if you run yourself all the way down.

**You might be their only smile today.** All of the above being said, it’s true that we don’t know what people have going on in their lives, and the holidays can hold a lot of trauma for people, myself included. Assume best intentions and if you have any kindness to spare, try to be the light in someone’s day. 

As a looooooong time partner, I’m with you all in spirit and hope you all have as smooth of a shift as possible. Hang in there. Try to have fun. If you can’t have fun, at least try not to stress too much. Remember. **You can’t pour from an empty pitcher.**

If you have any mantras or prayers or affirmations that get you through your tough shifts, chime in. ",2,1764216597.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

1p7sk2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetdecor/comments/1p7sk2s/found_a_deal_on_cheap_living_room_sets_should_i/,Found a deal on cheap living room sets. Should I go for it or wait?,"I’ve been slowly furnishing my apartment since I moved in last fall. Right now, my living room is basically a rug, a thrifted coffee table, and one very tired loveseat I got from Facebook Marketplace. It’s… functional but every time I have friends over, it just kinda reminds me that I could do a lot more with the place.

This week I saw a deal online for a full living room set. A couch, two chairs, and a table  for around $480. I know it sounds a bit too good to be true but the reviews look a bit decent, I guess. It’s one of those bundled living room sets you see everywhere lately. I even saw a few similar ones while scrolling through Alibaba the other night, work related though. My hesitation is, I’ve been trying to avoid the whole buy-it-twice trap. I’d rather spend a little more on something that lasts but at the same time, my living room looks so bare right now it’s kind of depressing. The paint on the wall is cream-colored, and the furniture set I saw is dark brown. Not so creative, but it serves in my opinion.

Would you go for something like this just to have furniture for now or wait and save up for better quality pieces?",1,1764216463.0,budgetdecor,0,1.0,False
1p7sjah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1p7sjah/i_was_just_forced_to_join_a_coffee_stained_blood/,I was just forced to join a coffee stained blood war.,"So, I accidentally joined a cult of coffee workers turned mafia soldiers.

The interview was going well until I saw the sword 

“Do you understand me?”

I blinked, trying to replay whatever the manager had just said. 

I had gotten distracted, mesmerized by the gilded sword blade on the wall behind her. 

A full-on, shimmering, definitely-not-from-IKEA sword. 

World of Warcraft shit. 

Why a coffee shop manager owned one was beyond me.

“Sim?” she prompted, tilting her head with a tight smile. “Did you hear me?”

I had, sort of. 

Under no circumstances was I to visit or go near the 2nd Street Starbucks. 

Doing so would result in disciplinary action, or worse.

I didn’t know what “or worse” meant, but the way her expression shifted from quirky-cat-lady to potential crime boss made me not want to find out.

Yikes.

“Uh, yeah,” I said. “I can’t go near the 2nd Street store.”

I almost choked on the water I had been nervously sipping for the entire interview. 

I had been sweating all day, June heat tends to melt people like me, and even though the evening was cooler, I had still downed about ten glasses.

“Is that *real*?” I blurted, pointing at the sword.

I know you are supposed to keep a professional vibe during job interviews, but that antique weapon was taunting me. 

Questions stormed my brain. 

How did she get it? 

Why did she have it? 

Was it décor, a threat, or a hobby? 

From her startled expression, I wasn’t the first person to ask.

She whipped around, her stern grey ponytail smacking the webcam, then turned back and gave a single confirming nod. Her eyes dropped to what I assumed was either a script or my printed résumé. 

I wanted to press her, but apparently a nod was all the explanation I was getting. 

She continued with the standard interview questions, about teamwork, independence, special requirements, and then threw in one that made every alarm bell in my soul start ringing:

“Have you ever handled a firearm, Sim?” 

Between that and the medieval sword dangling behind a forty-something manager, I was beginning to seriously question what this job actually involved. 

Sure, serving coffee was a given, but last I checked, baristas didn’t need military training.

When I didn’t know what to say, she seemed to back-pedal. “Oh, it’s in case of a robbery.” She said. But her expression stayed stoic. Speaking in the tone of being joking, but *not* being joking. “It's rare. However, it is a precaution we must take.” 

Choosing her words carefully, the interviewer steepled her hands in front of her face, leaning her chin on her fingers. 

“Our employees are given basic fire-arm training in the instance that one day we may face a difficult situation. Now, I am not saying it is inevitable, but due to certain behavior throughout the years, it is, of course, better to be safe than sorry.”

“Oh.” I tried to smile. “No, I haven’t,” I paused, hoping my lack of ability to hold a gun wouldn’t screw up my chances. “But I can, uhh, I can learn?”

I said it like a question because it was a question. 

“Of course,” the woman said. “Sim, I am happy to hear that! We love employees who do their best to learn and thrive in our working environment!”

She paused and typed something on her laptop before her gaze found mine. 

“I’ll put you down for lessons on Friday mornings! How does that sound?” 

Before I could answer her—because I was starting to seriously question why she was so obsessed with training me to use a goddamn gun—she was nodding to herself. 

“I will put Jude in charge of you. I think he is working on Friday, so your induction and welcome can be completed in the morning…”

She trailed off into her own murmured conversation to herself before clearing her throat. I jumped.

I didn’t mean to jump, but her whole presence was putting me on edge. 

The lady had been nicer on the phone when she was grilling me on which Frozen character was my favorite. 

“Okay!” The interviewer gathered up her paperwork, beaming at me through the camera. “Can you start tomorrow? Let’s say…” her eyebrows furrowed together. “5:30? I will not be there for the first hour due to certain obligations,” 

She traced her lip with the tip of her index. “However, I have four employees working the front desk. I’m sure they will give you a warm welcome.” 

I noticed something twitching on her lips. 

It was almost like she was trying to stop herself from laughing—which was childish from a standpoint where I was the younger one, while she was the senior. 

She was supposed to be setting some kind of standard, and yet for some reason was more inclined in teasing me about workplace friendships. 

I wasn’t stupid, I knew what friendship was like in the workplace. It’s not “real” because you’re all there to do a job, not making lifelong friendships.

“I’m looking forward to meeting them,” I said when she snorted out a laugh that twisted up my gut.

""Absolutely,"" she responded. ""The team is very close, so don't take it personally if they're initially cautious. I'm confident that you'll all become great friends! Kai is a kind-hearted sweetheart, while Ana may seem standoffish initially, but she'll warm up to you once you get to know her.”

“Jude, on the other hand, will be your guide during the orientation, so it's best to stay close to him. In fact, it's recommended to shadow him during your first few hours since he's our top performer! Frankly, Sim, I can hardly wait for you to meet them! They're a great group!"" 

The way she was describing the other employees, I was expecting cartoon characters when I walked through the door. 

“Right,” I said. I was starting to regret applying. “I’ll be there.”

She ended the call with a bright smile, and her stupid cat walking on the keyboard. I shut my laptop, my cheeks burning. 

Well, that went…? 

Could I really say it went well?

I didn’t want to go. I trashed my application and deleted her number from my phone. 

But the next morning, fueled by precious caffeine, I came to a quick realization. 

I needed cash. No matter how much I didn’t want to, I had to go. 

By 5:30, I stepped into the familiar glow of the store, only to be stopped by a dark haired brunette in bright pink Ray-Bans scowling at me. “Do you work here?” 

She pointed to the store.

I shrugged. “I... guess?”

She scoffed, slipping off her sunglasses and fixing me with a sharp smile. “Your funeral.”

Normally, I’d just laugh off a stranger’s odd comment. But this? This felt personal.

“What?” I asked.

She didn’t answer, turning around and walking away.

Well, that was weird.

After that, I weighed the pros and cons of taking the job. Pros: cash and something to occupy my mind away from classes. 

Cons: insufferable colleagues and a manager who seemed the embodiment of unprofessional. 

The store was almost empty when I stepped through the automatic doors, letting the icy blast from the cooling fan hit my face. A dark-haired girl had her back to me, cleaning tables. 

She stiffened as I approached, like a cat bracing for an intruder, then relaxed and held up two fingers. The store was empty, so I had no idea who she was signaling to. 

I was halfway to the counter when a guy appeared out of nowhere, drying a cup with a rag. 

His hair was the first thing I noticed, bright red.

Pale skin, bright hair, he would stand out anywhere. He looked my age, maybe a little older, mid-twenties, with a wide smile and little else going on. Short-sleeved shirt, Starbucks apron, all standard. 

I’d expected quirky, cartoon-like weirdos and got an average Joe. 

Not that I was complaining. He leaned forward, his gaze flicking toward the door like he was waiting for someone. 

“You.” He pointed at me, then drew a line toward the door, brushing his hair from his face. 

“You a customer? Order a drink or get the fuck out.”

Wow.

And all that with a flash of a grin too. This guy definitely loved himself. 

“I'm Sim,” I said. “I was just—” 

His expression crumpled. “Oh.” He bounced on the balls of his feet, unable to stand still, like a hyperactive child. “You’re Sim, the newbie I’m supposed to train.” 

He shot me another award winning smile. “Apologies, Sim. We’re kinda on edge.” 

I nodded and offered a nervous wave.

“Jude,” he said, distracted. His gaze flicked back to the door, then returned to me. He shook his head as if to clear it. 

“All right, newbie!” Before I could react, he sprang over the counter with surprising agility, landing just inches from my face. Something in his expression warned me to step back. 

His breath was icy against my skin. “Why don’t you show us what you’re made of?”

Jude began the tour: the store, the back, the storage room, the staff room, and, bizarrely, a wooden door he called “The Drink.” I had no idea what that meant, but I made a mental note to avoid it. 

The backrooms were a labyrinth. 

Mold clung to peeling paint, old rugged floor tiles crunched beneath our feet. 

Jude spoke so fast it felt like he was trying to confuse me. 

By the time I struggled with my apron, he spun on his heels, brow raised.

“Your hair’s too long. Tie it up or you're fired. You can shadow me tonight, but don’t get in my way. We have two twenty-minute breaks, and during them we are contractually obligated to go down to the Second Street store and throw eggs at their windows. The girl you met who didn’t say a word? That’s Ana. You’ll get used to her.” 

His smile hit a level of fake I didn’t think was humanly possible.

He leapt in front of me like a hyperactive toddler, perfecting a spin. “Why don’t you follow me?”

“I'm sorry, what?” I hissed as Jude led me down a twisting corridor that dipped into random rooms, out-of-order elevators, and the creepiest staircase I had ever seen, disappearing into pitch-black darkness. 

I was still trying to process his words.

Jude glanced back with a frown. “What’s up?” He nodded at a blonde girl passing by, who shot me a smile and high-fived him before slipping through a door.

“You throw eggs at the store down the road?” I asked, still catching my breath.

His lip twitched, the start of a smile forming. He quickened his pace. 

“Did I say that? I was joking!” He whirled around, winking. 

This guy was going 1000 miles per hour, and wasn't even breaking a sweat. His steps were perfect, long legs catapulting him down the walkway.  “Can't you take a joke?” 

I stumbled to keep up, bumping into a younger brunette carrying a tray of cupcakes, whose eyes popped open wide, like a deer caught in headlights. 

He stumbled back, realized he was stuck, and  greeted me with a “Sup new girl!” And a cryptic smile in Jude’s direction. 

I picked up their conversation through subtle eye movements. They weren’t talking about me. Thankfully. 

Though they were worried about something. I had to wonder what it was that had the barista acting on edge.

The brunette quite literally ran away from me, like I was contagious. 

“That’s Kai,” Jude said as we pushed through the doors back to the main storefront. He took a customer’s order, wearing that same effortless grin. 

“Don't bother.” He shot me a look while frothing milk. I worked with him, perfecting hot cocoa while he dealt with a whiny customer. “Our youngest and most recent recruit is both gay, and dangerous.”

“I'm sorry, *dangerous*?” I whispered. Maybe I heard him wrong.

“Yeah.” Jude definitely wasn’t joking. “Keep your distance from him for now, all right? He’s still kinda fresh, so Kai’s not fully, uh, *acquainted* with our way of doing things.” His expression brightened. 

“But if you need help with those ridiculous TikTok drinks that probably break several Geneva Convention rules, Kai’s your guy! He runs our social media and has an uncanny talent for sniffing out the next big trend. He’ll handle the zoomers.”

He bumped me playfully while working, his hands moving with precision as he assembled a latte in seconds. Slowly, I started settling into the job. 

My colleagues were surprisingly welcoming. 

I ended up sorting cookies and making price labels with Aurora, the perky blonde who had high-fived Jude earlier. 

She talked to me like we’d been best friends for years, and that effortless charm made me instantly like her.

Small as she was, her sharp tongue could cut through anyone. 

Jude spent the evening showing me the ropes, chatting about his home life and childhood while cleaning tables, always looping me into conversations so I didn’t feel left out. 

I was actually enjoying myself, bobbing my head to the radio while serving a group of kids, when Jude suddenly went rigid. 

His laughing smile shifted into something unreadable, a mask snapping into something darker. 

Aurora, cleaning tables nearby, stiffened too, her eyes flicking to the door. 

Kai, grinding coffee, snapped his head up. 

Standing at the entrance was the manager who interviewed me. 

Unlike last night, she wasn’t smiling. She dropped her bag at the door and strode toward the counter. 

Jude leaned across it, a napkin in hand, his expression was tight and apprehensive. “*Well*?”

His eyes had darkened, his easygoing tone replaced with something sharp. 

The relaxed façades my colleagues had worn all evening, the jokes and the bright smiles, slipped away, revealing glimpses of something they’d been hiding. 

Jude’s splintered gaze never left the manager as she paced back and forth, chewing her nails. “Where is he?” 

“Jude.” She said, like an exasperated mother. “Please be quiet.” 

He laughed, but his eyes were dark. “Ren is missing,” he snapped. “So, WHAT did they do to him?” 

“I don’t *know*, sweetie,” she said finally, lifting her head. Her lips twisted. This woman was not what I was expecting. 

Dressed head to toe in red. Silky silver hair pulled into a ponytail. 

“But…” 

She spat each word as she rounded the counter and poured herself coffee. “You’re going to pay those bastards a visit right now and sort this out once and for all.” 

Her voice carried a sharp, commanding edge, like a mother addressing children. Her eyes pierced, asserting authority. “Do you understand me?”

She nodded at Jude.

“You can go.” Then her gaze fell on me. “Take the new girl. Darling needs to be inducted.” 

Finally, she turned to Ana, who had been standing silently in the corner. 

“You too. I need brains and dear Jude is brawn. Keep him on his toes, young lady.”

Jude gave a brief, sarcastic, “Thanks,” before grabbing a coffee cup and a Sharpie. In one swift motion, he scribbled something on the side, dropped the cup in a bag, and plopped it in front of me. 

Reaching for his coat, he slid it over his green Starbucks apron, the denim-blue sherpa underneath creating a striking contrast. With his mop of red curls, he was hardly inconspicuous.

“We’ll manage the conversation,” he said quickly, eyes bright. 

His confidence and wit seemed to lift the others’ moods, spreading smiles across their faces. He shoved his hands into his pockets. “All you gotta do is hand them this, all right, new girl?” 

“Is that a good idea…?” Kai started, trailing off, when he caught Jude's glare.

“I think it’s perfect!” The manager beamed at me. “What a way to fully bring our newbie into our family!”

I hesitated, taking the empty coffee cup. “What is it?”

“It’s a gift!” Jude said, striding toward the door. His energy was practically vibrating, manic, alive. “I want them to know we appreciate them! You know, rival to rival.”

Kai stepped in front of him, keeping his distance from me, sleeves pulled over his nose and mouth. 

I tried not to take it personally. But the longer I looked, the more obvious it became. He couldn’t take his eyes off Jude. “Be careful,” he said, his tone sharp. 

Aurora stayed close to him, silent, her left hand fidgeting at her waistband. 

“Keep your head down. They’ll be expecting you and expecting retaliation. Do what you need to do and get out. If anything goes wrong, we’ll follow your lead.”

Jude smirked. He was so easy going. He was driving me insane. 

“Relaaaax, it’s Cora! We used to date!” Jude tilted his head. 

He nodded at the manager. “I think? That's what you guys tell me, anyway.”

Kai shoved him. “I *mean* it.” He gritted out. “Don't get caught.” His lips pricked into a smile. “idiot.” 

Jude glanced at me briefly, then smiled wider. “Well, we have enough eggs, don’t we?” 

He grabbed my arm and pulled me along. Ana was already gone, slinking down the street, melting into the shadows. 

Once we hit the cool night air, Jude broke into a power-walk, jaw set, eyes fixed ahead. 

If this guy was serious about vandalizing a rival coffee store, and being egged on by his manager, I figured I should *probably* ask what his deal was.

The thought of ending up in jail over a petty rivalry made my stomach twist.

“So, what’s this about?” I asked, breaking into a half-run to keep up. 

Jude’s legs were absurdly long. He was halfway across the sidewalk while I was barely two steps in front. “Aren’t you taking this a little *too* seriously?”

“Nope!”

I kept his pace. “What did you mean by you “think” you dated the girl who works at the rival store?”

Jude shrugged. “Amnesia.”

“Amnesia?” 

He grinned, jumping over cracks in the sidewalk. “Yep! I can't remember anything before working here.” 

I had a hard time replying. “Shouldn't you… I don't know, maybe get that checked out at the hospital?” 

He burst out laughing, and warmth spread across my cheeks. “Nah, I'm good! Everyone has a little amnesia, right?” 

“You're a weird guy,” I managed. 

Jude didn’t answer. Instead, still giggling, he tilted his head. “Hey, Ana!” he shouted. “Wait up!”

Second Street felt more like stepping into a palace than a coffee shop. 

No wonder these branches hated each other. The building stretched across three floors: a coffee store on the ground level, a library above it, and what looked like a private apartment at the top. 

Twinkling lights framed the entrance, and through the wide windows a small fountain shimmered in front of polished wooden tables and plush chairs. 

The store was definitely closed. 

A large sign on the door spelled that out clearly. 

Still, Ana kicked her way through. 

Jude followed, dragging me in after him. Only two employees remained: a blond guy mopping the floor and a fluffy blonde at the till flipping through the register. 

The moment we stepped in, the guy froze mid‑swipe, fingers tightening around the mop handle. “Hey there!” Jude called, lifting his hands in playful surrender and flashing one of his trademark fake smiles. 

“No need for alarm! We’re from the coffee store down the road! We come in peace.” 

He gave a mocking bow to prove his innocence, jerking his chin toward me, and gave me a very aggressive and obvious nod. 

“Can we talk to your manager?” I asked.

The guy edged back, lips twitching, eyes narrowing. The girl stopped sorting cash and set it down carefully, a faint smirk tugging at her mouth.

Jude sauntered forward with a teasing, almost dance‑like bounce. 

There was a glint in his eyes, mischievous and childish, completely at odds with the man he was supposed to be. “Would you like to try our newest coffee recipe? It’s like sipping liquid sunshine.” 

He brushed his jeans as if dusting off crumbs, and I half‑expected him to pull out an egg like some bizarre magician. 

“But,” he took another step, and Ana slid behind the blond boy with an unreadable expression, “you’ve already tried it, ain't cha?”

The girl at the counter propped her chin on her fist as she studied him, amusement curling her lips. 

“Jude,” she murmured, her voice silky and seductive. 

Her apron was barely holding down her cleavage.  

“Didn’t think I’d see you here so soon.”

“Cora.” Jude’s grin twitched. “Trust me, I didn’t want to be here either, but orders are orders.”

Her gaze swept over him like she was assembling a puzzle. “And you actually listen to her?”

Jude’s smile widened, his hand brushing the front of his apron. I braced myself for egg-yolk. “Like a dog.”

“You know her?” I hissed, clutching the coffee cup.

“Cora?” Jude looked at me. “Damn, right! We used to be the Romeo and Juliet of coffee shop rivalries,” he said with a small smirk. 

“Back when we were newbies here and our store kidnapped me as a last resort. To keep the peace and stop the bloodshed, I stayed. At least, that’s what these guys tell me.” 

Coffee shop lore was getting dark.

These guys had to be joking around, right? This was just a fucking RP at this point. 

I stepped back, eager for the door, desperate to put as much distance between myself and what I was pretty sure was about to be a combination of eggs and arrests. I was too fucking broke for this. 

“You worked here?” I hissed. 

I tried to take slow steps back, until Jude caught my arm. His smile faded. 

“Apparently,” he deadpanned, dragging me back to his side. 

“Jude, don’t be so modest,” Cora trilled, shooting me a grin. But her eyes were hollow. Distant— hurting. 

“Jude was my first love… that is, until your boss took him from us, brainwashing him into hating us and becoming a stranger who looked right through me. She turned him into a monster—”

“Why don’t you give ‘em their gift?” Jude cut her off, snapping at me. 

Fuck.

I unwrapped the bag, pulled out the cup. “I just started working here,” I said, shooting Cora an apologetic smile. I mentally pleaded with her. I'm not with them, I screamed with my eyes. Whatever shit these idiots pull, I was never okay with any of this!

“Sim.” Jude snapped. “Cora wants her gift.” His lip curled. “Give her the fucking coffee cup.” 

I placed it down in front of her. Cora frowned and picked it up, her gaze flicking to the side. 

Jude really had outdone himself. Twenty five year old guy, by the way. 

Cora’s frown pricked into a smile. She laughed. 

“Go fuck yourselves, Second Street Bloodsuckers!” Cora’s brows shot up toward her hairline as she read it aloud. “Wow!” Her eyes found Jude. “Real mature.”

Shit.

“I should probably go,” I managed, backing away. “I don’t think—”

The rest of my words exploded in my head when a force slammed into my ears, knocking me to my knees. 

At first, I didn’t know what it was. It sounded like a nuclear bomb had gone off. 

The ringing subsided, leaving me with my head buried in my knees, hands clamped over my ears. I didn't even hear my knees hitting the ground: Pop. Pop. Pop. 

Gunshots. 

Each crack ricocheted through my skull. 

A robbery. 

We were being robbed. 

No.

Fuck. 

Second Street was being robbed.

I lifted my head, expecting to see Jude cowering under a table, muffling his yelling, and Ana pulling him to safety. 

But that wasn’t it. I must have been imagining things. Jude hadn’t moved. 

His hand was perfectly melded with a gun, held like he had been trained for this moment. Calm. 

Precise. Deadly. 

The gun’s trajectory was aimed straight between Cora’s eyes, but Jude hadn’t fired. 

Neither had Ana, still stiff behind a blonde guy. It was a girl behind the counter, appearing from nowhere, wielding a weapon straight out of an action movie. 

I noticed Jude shifting slightly to avoid her aim, yet his entire demeanor stayed unnervingly relaxed.

“The deal is off, Cora,” he said, lowering the gun slightly. “You fuck with us, and we fuck with you.” He stepped closer. “Where’s Ren? He came to sniff out the coffee recipe you stole. So, where is he?”

Cora stayed unnervingly calm, raising her hands, “Sweetie, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Ren.” He gritted his teeth, his finger effortlessly finding the trigger. “What did you do to him?” 

Cora’s lips quirked. “Put the gun down. We can talk about this. I know they fucked with your head, but you need to remember it's *me* you're pointing a gun at.” 

She lowered her hands slowly. “Jude, it's Cora. You know you would never hurt me.” 

He laughed. “Because we *dated*?” 

“Because you promised me,” Cora said, her eyes narrowing. “The night before they took you, you promised me— even with a diseased mind empty of me, you know you would never hurt me—”

Jude fired. Twice.

Both bullets struck her square between the eyes. 

Here it is with all em dashes removed, keeping the flow and style intact:

When she hit the floor, the world erupted.

Jude dove sideways, skidding behind a table just as a bullet hissed past my ear. 

He fired while twisting mid-fall, dropping the barista who had nearly shot me. Five of them. Five sharpshooters. Too skilled. 

Too fast. 

Ana moved with surgical precision. 

Three shots, three bodies: a blonde, a brunette, and a bald man who crashed through the counter in an explosion of splintered wood. Jude’s firefight with another gunman grew desperate. 

He shoved me to my knees, dragging me under a table. 

“Stay there,” he hissed. 

After a few failed bursts, a hasty reload, and several wild shots fired from the floor, he finally launched to his feet, tossed his gun, and vaulted over the counter, a monstrous snarl ripping from his lips. 

The Second Street shooters broke into a frenzy of firing, but he was too fast. 

I couldn’t tell what horrified me more: 

Ana tearing apart their coffee machine like it owed her money, or Jude snapping a boy’s neck with one brutal twist, then gouging out his eyes and folding the body across his knees, his teeth brushing the flesh of the boy’s throat. 

Jude’s eyes flashed, irises ringed with a color that wasn’t quite human, teeth far too sharp. I realized what he was when his lips found the man’s pulse. 

Instead of biting, he drew back. 

“Urgh!” He moaned, shoving the corpse off him. “He reeks of it!” Glass crunched under his boots as he stepped through blood pooling on the tiles. 

Jude grabbed a cup, took a swig, and immediately spat it across the ruined counter.

“That,” he gagged, “That's fucking diabolical.”

Ana stepped in front of him, resting her hands on his shoulders. 

“Calm down,” she said, and his fangs retracted obediently. Jude nodded, shoving her off of him. 

“I'm fine,” he rolled his eyes. “I can control myself.” 

She nodded with a tight smile. “When any clan member is murdered without cause, an imbalance forms and the  coffee turns foul. We have to restore balance before things get out of control.” 

Her British accent caught me off guard. She flicked a glance at me, then pinned Jude with a sharp look.

“You stepped on Second Street territory without prior permission. That in itself is an act of war.” 

Jude blinked. “You're not serious.” 

Ana nodded. “Turning you without your consent was already a slippery slope. They took Ren to level the playing field, and now we’ve killed one of their top operatives.” 

She grinned at me, raising her arms in a mock shrug, like she was saying, *oops!“* 

“We just declared war.”

The girl twisted around, picked up her gun and reloaded. “We should go.”

“Aye, aye, captain.” He mock-saluted before nodding at me. “Sim. Grab a sample. We’ll go find the altar.”

Something ice-cold slid down my spine.

“Alter?”

“Cool it. It’s more fun than it sounds,” Jude said. “Grab the samples.”

Running on pure adrenaline, I did exactly what he told me. 

I grabbed two coffee cups. “Okay. What now? We go home, right?”

He wiped his mouth with a grimace. “Are you kidding? No, man. We get coffee that isn’t tainted.”

Ana had already taken out two guards in the back and was waving us through a heavy metal door. 

It opened into tunnels, lit only by candles. “You just killed multiple people,” I finally managed to choke out as I followed them deeper into the dark. “Over ""*coffee*!” 

A hysterical laugh burst out of me and cracked into a sob. 

“You just murdered seven baristas over fucking coffee! You're all *insane!”*

I kept backing away, scanning for an exit, any exit out of this nightmare.

Jude glanced over his shoulder. Candlelight caught the glitter in his eyes. “Oh, please,” he chuckled. “Do you really think this is just about coffee?”

I didn’t understand, not until we reached the end of the tunnel. It opened into an alcove and then into a massive cave-like room. Jude drew his gun and swept the dark. “Anyone in here?” he called. 

Ana smacked his arm. Only silence answered.

I froze.

I didn’t know what to stare at first: the ten-foot-tall Starbucks Siren looming over us in flickering orange light, or the old swimming pool filled to the brim with—

My foot sank into something soft. I looked down.

Bodies.

I guessed that was “The Drink.”

My legs gave out, but Ana caught me before I toppled into the mass of decomposing flesh and severed heads arranged almost ritualistically. 

Bodies were everywhere, contorted skeletons still knelt in prayer. 

Jude dropped to his knees beside a boy still wearing his Starbucks apron. 

The guy’s eyes had been cleanly plucked from his skull. Candlelight made Jude’s expression almost reverent.

“Fuck, dude,” he whispered. “Looks like they got you.”

“Which explains how they stole our recipe.” Ana clicked the safety off her gun. 

Her eyes shimmered, lip wobbling. 

It was impossible to believe the same girl who had executed three baristas point-blank was on the verge of crying. “They got our recipe through Ren.”

“What is this place?” I breathed. “What the fuck are you two doing down here?”

Ana stepped behind him, her hands shaking as she raised her gun, pointing to the back of his neck. 

“It used to be ours,” Jude said. “Then more stores opened. Everything turned into a free-for-all.” He rocked on his heels; Ana’s trigger finger tracked the movement. 

“We had a peace treaty. Second Street has always wanted this blend. They’re greedy. First they took our manager. The guy was like a dad. Sliced him up and mailed us his head.” 

He nodded to Ana. “Then they took Ren. They brought this shit on themselves.” 

Jude slowly knelt in front of the Siren. Eyes closed. Head bowed. Ana didn’t move.

“Are you ready?” she asked quietly.

He turned, flashing a grin. “Always.”

I screamed into my palm as Ana shot him point-blank in the back of the head, and he dropped— crumpling to the ground. 

Something in me cracked open, and suddenly I couldn’t breathe. 

I thought they were playing some deranged joke, until I saw his blood, seeping black shadow seeping across the altar. 

In the wavering amber light, it was almost mesmerizing. “Shush!” Ana snapped at me, already dragging Jude’s body. 

“Make yourself useful and grab a bucket.”

I watched her stumble toward the pool, my pulse slamming in my throat. When I didn’t move, she whirled around. “Did you not hear me?!” she yelled. 

“Get a bucket and collect it!” 

Ana gestured to a rusted pipe hanging over the pool, dribbling murky brown water into the cavern.

I stepped forward, but she shook her head.

“Not yet.” She heaved Jude’s body into the darkness. A splash followed, but I didn’t see him hit the surface. 

I wanted to scream, to demand what the hell she was doing, but my hands were shaking too badly to do anything except snatch a bucket and inch toward the pool. 

“I said not yet!” Ana hissed.

I opened my mouth, but she raised a finger.

“Do it now.”

“The pool water?!” I shrieked.

She raised an eyebrow. “You think that’s *water*?”

Before I could force out a reply, the ground shook beneath us, like a sudden earthquake, a sudden monstrous screech sending me to my knees. 

My body worked against me, mesmerised, hypnotized by the cry. I dropped the bucket into the pool and scooped up as much as I could.  It wasn’t water. Thick, sticky, warm. 

I lurched back. 

Blood. Coffee-brown blood. 

My stomach twisted, threatening to betray me, but I swallowed anyway and managed three buckets before Ana grabbed my shoulders and pulled me back. 

I didn’t realize I was sobbing until she pressed a handkerchief into my hands. I stared at it. 

“What do you expect me to do with this?”

Still in shock, I tried to grab another bucket, but she held me back. 

“You can stop. We have enough.”

“Enough *what*?”

The pool rippled, and I staggered back. I didn’t know what I expected, dead bodies? 

Decapitated heads? 

Not Jude. 

But there he was, rising from the brown, murky liquid I had just filled my buckets with. 

I almost hurled one at his head. Despite being drenched in coffee-blood, his skin was flawless. And naked. Which should have been my focus, except he was alive. 

Resurrected, right in front of a ten-foot Starbucks siren statue. 

Completely normal.

My cheeks heated anyway. 

Jude ran a hand through his soaked curls, shook his hair like a dog, then hauled himself out of the pool, drawing ragged breaths. 

He lay there for a while, gasping into his arms. I risked getting closer to him. No gunshot wound. 

His skin had that unnerving grey tint of death, yet he was intact. 

Jude grinned, covering himself. 

I looked away, my cheeks heating up. 

“Fuck.” He made a huge deal of hiding his groin. “I didn’t think this through.”

“I did.” Ana dug into her backpack and pulled out a shirt and jeans. 

She tossed them at him with a small smirk. “Get dressed. I think we managed to appease them.”

“Sweet!” Jude grinned, quickly dressing. He sucked the tips of his fingers and nodded at Ana. “Tastes good.”

To my horror, Ana delicately licked his fingers, smiling. 

“Cherry blossom,” she said.

His gaze landed on me. 

That inhuman gleam in his eye, the one I had seen before the resurrection, was back. Coffee, or blood, dripped in thick rivulets down his temple. 

He turned to Ana. “While we’re here, right? Might as well induct the newbie.”

I stepped back instinctively, but he advanced, close enough that his breath hit my face. 

There was something in his eyes I hadn’t expected. Envy. Another step, and I would have fallen into that horrifying pool of decomposing bodies and resurrecting coffee. “Not now,” Ana murmured. 

Jude snapped out of it and stepped back.

“Buzzkill,” he muttered, though he stayed far enough for me to inch away.

“Later,” Ana said. “She’s shaken. We can do it first thing tomorrow.”

To my shock, there were no cops when we returned to Second Street. No scene at all. 

The store looked normal. I didn’t have the energy to question it. 

Aurora hugged me, and I tried to pull away as quickly as possible. 

There was something unsettling about her smile when she said, “I’m so happy I have a little sister!” while tucking a grenade into her apron. I caught Kai discreetly sliding a gun down his pants.

So, yeah. They were all trained assassins. Cool.

I still had a shift to finish. I’d just witnessed a man resurrected in coffee-stained blood at a Starbucks shrine, and yet here I was, still obligated to make drinks until closing.

Near the end of my shift, the doors swung open. 

The girl from earlier, the one with the pink Ray-Bans, slipped inside and stepped right in front of me. She didn’t say a word. 

The blade of her knife skimmed my gut, saying everything I needed to know. 

Kai and Aurora circled her like predators, but she didn’t even flinch.

“Relax,” she rolled her eyes. “I’m just here to deliver a message, since you mother fuckers seem to have forgotten the terms of our agreement.” 

Her gaze flicked to Aurora. “You took one of ours, so we evened the score.” 

She tilted her head, lips curving, eyes flashing dangerously. “Then you bring our dead brother back to us, just to rub it in.” 

The girl sauntered toward Aurora, hips swinging, a smile tugging at her lips. Kai snarled.

The two girls came face to face. Aurora’s jaw was set, her fingers twitching toward her apron. “Bring Jude back to us, and we’ll see this as a misunderstanding,” the girl said, blowing in Aurora’s face. 

Her eyes flicked to Kai, lips curling in disgust. “Aurora, darling, control your *mutt*.”

Before she left, the girl pressed a note into my hand and tossed her shades in my face. 

“Nice meeting you, newbie! Come see us some time!” 

When she was gone, Aurora shot me a sheepish smile. She subtly nodded at Kai to block the door— block my escape. 

Aurora sighed, pulling her hair into a ponytail. “I'm sorry you walked into all this, Sim.” 

I swallowed. “You're not going to let me go, are you?” 

It was Kai who responded, this time with a shark grin. “Not until you're inducted, sweetheart.” 

I stepped back, my heart pounding. “This was all you,” I said. “You kidnapped Jude. You started this!”

I handed the note to the manager, who almost died laughing, and tossed it in the trash.

“You work for psychopaths,” I said, sidling in front of Jude as he clocked out, eyes glued to his phone. I shut the door to avoid being caught talking bad about the boss. 

Apparently, that was a no-no. 

There was still blood smearing the back of his neck, glued to strands of his hair. I had to explain to a customer it was makeup. 

I stepped in front of him, well aware of what he was. 

Somehow, though, I wasn't scared of him. 

“You fucking died, was resurrected by a ten foot statue of a Starbucks siren, and you're working for them like nothing happened.” 

“Mmm.” Jude murmured, a cigarette balanced between his lips. I noticed his phone screen. 

Candy Crush. 

I couldn't help it, shoving him. “You can run!” I hissed. “You’re originally from Second Street, right? What's stopping you from going back to them?”

Jude didn’t look up from his phone. “It’s complicated.” His lip quirked. “You’ll find out tomorrow during your induction.”

“But you work for these people. And you’re not trying to get away?” I whispered, gesturing to Kai and Aurora near the door. “None of you?”

Jude’s head snapped up, an inhuman twitch that sent me stumbling back. 

“I’m sorry. I don’t think you understand.”

He stepped closer, so close his breath smothered me. Being near him made one thing painfully obvious: he was a good liar. 

He hid behind bright smiles and easy jokes, but underneath it all, he was a hostage pretending he had free will.

“Do you think I have a fucking choice?”

He laughed, leaning in until his breath fluttered against my cheek. “Me? A choice? You really think I wake up every morning wanting to do this? You walked in here on purpose. I didn’t. They took me."" 

""I don’t even remember my interview or my first day. I don’t remember my time at Second Street. And you seriously think I’m enjoying this? That I like being some emotionless freak? That I *like* bathing in sacrificial coffee?” 

His voice pitched into a warped whine. “Take Kai, for example! He’s everything wrong with this place. Just a college kid wanting extra cash, and now he’s a fucking soldier.” 

Jude barked out a laugh. “The guy’s obsessed with me! Because you wanna know what I did?” 

He prodded me between the eyes. 

“I dragged him, kicking and screaming, into the drink, shot him in the head, and turned him into a freakin’ monster.”

He leaned in until his forehead tapped mine, his eyes feral, elongated spikes retracting. “And do you knew what's fucked?” His lips found my ear. “Dude actually has a fucking crush on me. It's adorable.” 

Jude grabbed my shoulders, squeezing them. “It’s fucked. I’m fucked. And now *you* are fucked!” He whistled, leaning back and tossing me a towel. “Finish cleaning up. I’ll see you tomorrow for induction.”

There was cruelty in his smile, like just the thought of me becoming like him filled him with pleasure.

When everyone left, I found the discarded note in the trash and smoothed it out:

No one laughs. No one reacts. The energy shifts. You start calculating how fast you can disappear. This isn’t just introvert anxiety. It’s the very real (and very under-discussed) skill of ""reading the room"",  a skill most people are horrible at but pretend they’re amazing at.

I’ve seen too many people,  smart people,  tank job interviews, kill friendships, or start fights in relationships because they missed a vibe shift. And social media made it worse. TikTok advice like “just be authentic” or “speak your truth” is cute in theory, but when used at the wrong time, it makes you that cringey person who doesn’t know when to shut up. So I dug into the science, the psychology, and tools that actually help. This post is everything I wish was taught in school: how to really decode social dynamics in real time.

Here’s a practical, non-BS guide to learning how to read the room,  based on research, expert advice, books, and tools that actually teach social intelligence.

---

1. **Train your brain to notice power and energy first**

The first thing you should catch when entering any situation isn’t who you *like* or who looks cool. It’s who’s speaking the most, who’s listening the most, and whose mood is contagious. This is emotional power. In political science and behavioral research, they call this ""status dynamics."" You don’t need to be Machiavelli to use it. Just observe: Where are people turning their bodies? Who gets silent when they speak? Who gets interrupted? These are all live data points.

Daniel Goleman, author of *Social Intelligence*talks a lot about ""emotional attunement"",  the ability to sync with others by reading micro-reactions: eyes, breath, posture. Once you get better at this, you’ll start talking *with* the energy in the room, not against it. It's like surfing,  if you ignore the wave, you get wrecked.

---

2. **Learn to read silence as a message**

Silence isn’t neutral. It’s feedback. Sometimes it’s uncomfortable. Other times it’s disagreement. Or maybe people are processing something raw. If you reply too fast to a group going quiet, you’re signaling, “I didn’t notice that shift.” That's how people start mentally filing you under “socially unaware.”

Psychologist Esther Perel says, “The quality of your relationships is determined by the quality of the space between you.” Reading that space,  pauses, looks, the *absence* of sound,  is what keeps conversations alive. If the room falls quiet after a comment, don’t rush in. Hold. Look around. Let the energy guide your next move.

---

3. **Control your “impulse to contribute”,  it’s not always your turn**

I had to unlearn this the hard way in grad school seminars and team meetings. I thought being “engaged” meant jumping in with takes. But contributing isn't just about being heard, it’s about knowing *when* your voice adds value.

Adam Grant’s book *Think Again* covers this dynamic perfectly. He says high EQ people often ask themselves, “Does the room need my point, or do I just need to say it for my ego?” That question changed how I show up. Sometimes, waiting those 10 extra seconds gives someone else space,  and earns you more credibility when you *do* speak.

---

4. **Watch people’s eyes,  not their words**

You want to know how people *really* feel about what you're saying? Look at where their eyes go. If they start scanning the room, glancing at others, or blinking fast, they’re disengaging. If they’re holding eye contact, leaning slightly in, and subtly nodding, that’s a green light.

Neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett (from the book *How Emotions Are Made*) explains this with brain science: our brains are constantly running “predictive models” based on facial inputs. If you can master decoding subtle facial shifts, you’ll know how your words are landing before anyone replies. It's not mind reading, it’s pattern reading.

---

5. **Build a micro-habit of daily social observation**

Instead of zoning out in public, treat every social setting like a lab. Watch who speaks first in coffee shop groups. Notice how couples on the train sync up or disconnect. This isn’t creepy. It’s cognitive re-training.

One app that helped me build this habit is *Notes on Blindness*, originally designed as a VR project. It teaches you to *listen* and *feel* your way through environments. Super helpful if you're overwhelmed visually or want to tune your radar better. It reframes the world into a social soundscape.

---

6. **Make learning part of your life**

I’ve been using an app called *BeFreed* lately to sharpen emotional intelligence and conversation skills. It’s not just quotes or summaries,  you basically tell it what you’re working on (like “how to become better at tension in meetings” or “how to know when to speak less”), and it creates personalized podcast-style lessons on the spot. I’ll usually listen during my evening walk, then pause when I hear something that hits and follow up with a “what’s an example of that?” or “how do I try that tomorrow?” That back-and-forth makes it stick more than any self-help book ever has.

---

7. **This book will CHANGE how you speak forever**

*The Art of Gathering* by Priya Parker is the best book I’ve ever read on social dynamics. She works with global leaders, diplomats, and founders to teach one thing: intentional group energy. It’s not about being polite or having good manners. It’s about designing *presence*. Whether you’re running a meeting, trying to unite a group, or just want to not kill a vibe,  this book gives you the strategy blueprint. It made me rethink everything I assumed about conversation.

---

8. **Listen to people who talk about silence often**

If you want a voice in your head that makes you pause before talking, listen to *On Being with Krista Tippett*. It’s one of the few podcasts that teaches you the art of thoughtful presence. Guests like poet David Whyte and civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson share insights that aren’t just “useful”,  they change your baseline settings. I usually listen to it when I feel overstimulated or reactive. It resets my inner chatter.

---

9. **Train your reactions in real time with AI mirrors**

*Cue* is a surprisingly powerful app where you upload a speech or practice saying your opinion on video. It gives emotional tone feedback, pacing analysis, and even tells you if you’re cutting people off without realizing. I used it before a job panel interview and ended up seeing how often I speak over others when excited. I haven't un-learned that yet, but now I pause more. Worth checking out if you want instant feedback.

---

10. **This YouTube channel will give you social x-ray vision**

If you want to learn real-time social decoding, check out *Charisma on Command* on YouTube. Yes, the name’s cheesy. But the breakdowns are elite. They analyze scenes from shows like *Suits*, *Succession*, or real-life interviews (Obama, Zendaya, etc.) and dissect what works and what fails in communication. It’s like watching gossip with subtitles for emotional power.

---

In the end, speaking well isn’t just about saying smart things. It’s about sensing patterns, pausing at the right time, holding tension, and knowing when silence says more than words ever could.",1,1764216330.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

The good news is that Canadian employers value potential as much as experience. With the right preparation, you can stand out even if you have never worked in Canada before.

This guide explains how international students can get an internship in Canada, breaking the journey into **three practical stages:** Growing Professionally, Networking Effectively, and Preparing Your Application Documents. Follow these steps to build confidence and land your first opportunity.

# Stage 1: Growing Professionally

Before you apply, you need direction. Employers notice when a student understands their strengths and goals.

# 1. Set Clear Career Goals

Career goals keep your search intentional instead of scattered. Instead of applying to every job you see online, define the direction you want to pursue. For example, if you are a student who has decided you want to become a financial analyst, you might join finance clubs, build technical skills, or take relevant courses. On the other hand, if you have years of experience in a field, focusing on re-certification and strengthening skills can help you transition into similar roles in Canada.

# 2. Use the SMART Goal Framework

[SMART](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound) goals make your plans achievable.  
Instead of saying “I want to improve Excel,” set a SMART goal; “I will complete an Excel certification by June 2026 to qualify for accounting internships.”

# 3. Understand Yourself with a SWOT Analysis

A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis helps you understand where you stand so you can make intentional decisions. For example, you might identify Excel as a strength and public speaking as a weakness. Your opportunities could include campus or community networking events, while threats might be a heavy course load or limited time. If you notice that public speaking is holding you back, you could join a club like Toastmasters. If you see newcomer workshops as opportunities, you might set a goal to attend two each month.

# 4. Learn to Ask for Feedback

Ask specific people for targeted advice. For example, you might ask a mentor to review your resume and point out where you could add measurable achievements. Or you could ask an instructor or your English teacher to help you practice interview questions so you feel more confident.

# 5. Craft Your Unique Value Proposition

Your UVP is what makes you different. It includes your skills, experiences, and something unique about your background. International students bring adaptability, global perspectives, multilingual skills, and resilience.

Template:  
 “I bring \[skills\] and \[experiences\], combined with \[unique background\], to help \[employer\] achieve \[outcome\].”

# 6. Build Your Elevator Pitch

An [elevator pitch](https://joinhandshake.com/blog/students/college-student-elevator-pitch/) is your UVP in 30 to 60 seconds.  
 For example:  
 “I am Maria, recently moved to Canada with 10 years of teaching experience. I specialize in early childhood education and have managed classrooms of more than 25 students. I am looking for opportunities to teach in BC.”

# Stage 2: Networking Basics

In Canada, your network often opens doors before job boards do.

# 1. Understand Why Networking Matters

Networking is about meaningful relationships, not collecting contacts. For example, you may meet a recruiter at a career fair who later refers you to an internship.

# 2. Overcome Anxiety and Connect Authentically

Start small. Use openers like “What drew you to this field” and share a short elevator pitch.

# 3. Use Coffee Chats to Learn

Coffee chats are low-pressure conversations that help you understand real career paths. Arrive early, dress neatly, bring thoughtful questions, and send a thank-you message within two days. Connecting with people on LinkedIn afterward helps you stay in touch.

# 4. Grow and Maintain Your Network

Attend events, join clubs, connect with alumni, and stay active on LinkedIn to build meaningful relationships. Focus on quality over quantity, check in occasionally, and maintain the connections you’ve built.

# 5. Practice Your Networking Skills

Plan coffee chats, prepare your questions, and follow up professionally. [The Unify Social app](https://unifysocial.ca/) makes this easier by providing guidance on how to network and connects you to newcomer-friendly events where meaningful conversations can start.

# Stage 3: Preparing Core Documents

Once you have clarity and connections, prepare documents that communicate your value.

# 1. Choose the Right Resume Format

A poorly formatted resume really hurts, [about 73% of hiring managers](https://www.resumetemplates.com/3-in-4-hiring-managers-pass-on-qualified-candidates-with-bad-resumes/) say they’ll eliminate qualified candidates because of bad resume formatting. 

Unify Social includes a clean, professional resume template right in the app. Download it to get access and give yourself a real shot at landing your first career opportunity.

# 2. Structure Your Resume Clearly

Use one page, clear headings, and bullet points that start with strong verbs.

# 3. Write Strong Bullet Points

Your bullet points should clearly show the impact of your work, not just the tasks you completed. Focus on what you achieved, how you did it, and any measurable results. Start with an action verb, describe the specific contribution you made, and highlight the outcome. This helps employers quickly understand the value you bring.

Example:  
Weak: “Worked on projects.”  
Strong: “Led a four person team to complete a project two weeks early.”

# 4. Tailor Each Resume

Use keywords from the job posting and match your achievements to the role.

# 5. Write a Compelling Cover Letter

Use this space to share your motivation and explain how your international experience transfers to the Canadian workplace. You can also see proven, successful cover letter examples in the Unify Social app.

# 6. Build a Portfolio with the CAR Method

While your resume uses short, one-line bullet points, your portfolio should go deeper. 

Use the [Challenge, Action, Result (CAR)](https://www.job-hunt.org/challenge-action-result-examples/) method to turn your experiences into short case studies. Explain the problem you faced, what steps you took, and the outcome you achieved. This gives employers a fuller picture of your skills.

Example: “Designed and launched a social campaign to address low engagement, resulting in a 40 percent increase over two months.”

# 7. Gather Testimonials and Recommendations

Ask mentors or coworkers for short, specific testimonials to strengthen your portfolio or LinkedIn profile. 

# Advice for International Students

This section is specifically for anyone wondering how international students can get an internship in Canada without Canadian experience.

# 1. Learn How the Canadian Hiring System Actually Works

Many international students struggle not because they lack talent, but because the Canadian job search process is unfamiliar. For a structured, step by step guide on resumes, networking, and interview preparation, we’ve built a complete roadmap inside the Unify Social app. Join the waitlist at [unifysocial.ca](https://unifysocial.ca/) for early access upon launch.

# 2. Translate Your International Experience into Canadian Context

Reframe past school work and volunteer experiences so employers understand their value.  
Instead of “Led a team of 5 in China,” use “Led a cross-cultural team of 5 and coordinated workflows across time zones.”

# 3. Use On Campus Roles to Build Canadian Experience Fast

Campus jobs, clubs, and research opportunities are trusted by employers and do not involve visa complications.

# 4. Join Newcomer Focused Career Programs

International students have access to specialized programs that domestic students cannot use. Services like [ISS](https://www.sfu.ca/students/iss.html), [YMCA newcomer programs](https://www.gv.ymca.ca/newcomer-services), [MOSAIC](https://mosaicbc.org/), [CareerEdge](https://www.careeredge.ca/), and [Unify Gather](https://unifysocial.ca/) provide tailored support and direct employer connections. Unify Gather career workshops are specifically designed to support international students with resume building, networking, and job search skills. Follow Unify Social on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unifysocial.ca/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/unify-social), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61570879043328) to stay updated on upcoming workshops.

# 5. Be Direct About Your Visa Situation

Reduce hesitation by stating your status clearly. For example:

“I am authorized to work in Canada without sponsorship for internships. My study permit allows 20 hours per week off campus and full-time during academic breaks.”

# 6. Build Your Network with Other International Students and Alumni

Search LinkedIn for “\[Your School Name\] + \[Your Home Country\].” Alumni with similar backgrounds are often more responsive because they understand your journey.

# 7. Highlight Your Language Skills as a Strength

Your ability to speak multiple languages can set you apart. Showcase this strength in roles that benefit from it, like customer service, marketing localization, research, or international teams.

# 8. Use Settlement and Newcomer Events as Networking Spaces

These events often include employers who are culturally aware and open to hiring newcomers, making them ideal spaces to build connections.

# 9. Ask Professors for Canadian References

If you don’t yet have Canadian work references, professors are strong alternatives. Participate in class and visit office hours to build trust and credibility.

# 10. Plan Your Job Search Ahead of Time

Because you may be building networks from scratch, start your search 3 to 6 months earlier to give yourself more time and more opportunities.

I reached out to support and was told they told me to try the side doors etc...

I tried to get the rep to guarantee the cancel was not going to count against me. He texted me that it will go against me and that if I work harder I can improve my cancel rate.

Then they texted me later,  I will not get paid because the order was picked up by someone else. They also told me not to quit misreporting and to not cancel.

What the fuck?!  It is so unnecessary.

I've been using this moka pot for the last year or so and recently (last month-ish), it's started running inconsistently. Frequently when I try to make coffee, it'll brew interminally and sputter out a few drops of coffee. Oddly, if I then clean, dry, and refill the pot with exactly the same variable, it runs perfectly with a beautiful, consistent flow. 

The gasket looks okay, so all I can think is that residual water inside the system is helping to pull coffee through like capillary. Or maybe the moka pot needs to ""warm up""? Any advice or ideas so that I dont have to run two cups of coffee every time?",1,1764215954.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I forgot the word “food” once.  The barista was very kind about it.

I don’t understand why there are multiple size options.  I want the largest size, and your largest isn’t big enough.

I will absolutely order the new limited time dessert in a cup.  You need to understand, I quit drinking alcohol almost 2 years ago and I have a sweet tooth for the first time since the Clinton administration.  And yes ma’am I do want whipped cream and whatever else you are offering on top.  

Coffee shops have too many options.  I’ve ordered shit I didn’t actually want because I froze and there was a line behind me.  

I have this idea for a coffee shop I’ll never own’s promotion I will never have.  “Try this fucking thing of the week.”  The barista I hire has the opportunity to choose a classic coffee drink I have never heard of with a French or Italian name.  They write it on the blackboard.   If the customer comes in they can say “I’ll try it” and the barista repeats the name to them, slowly, giving it time to register in their brain.  It’s a dollar less than it would be if it wasn’t the fucking thing this week.  We have now educated the masses, we have educated *me*, and I’ve given an employee a modicum of control.

When I was single, I flirted with baristas.  If I flirted with you and you didn’t like it, I’m sorry.  If I flirted with you and you liked it, you’re welcome. 

When I was married (ie, currently) I have told dad jokes to baristas.  If I told you a dad joke and you liked it, you’re welcome.  If I told you a dad joke and you didn’t like it, that’s part of why I put a dollar in the cup near the remastered greatest hits of Johnny Mathis CD.  

I dare you to confess that you were there when Starbucks removed those rings in the counter that magically recharged your cell phone like a thief in the night. Admit it.  They just stopped fucking working, didn’t they? 

I would sooner neuter a puppy with a weed whacker than make a barista make a coffee for me on the clover machine.  Not today, Satan.

New etiquette rule.  Go ahead and sit at a table all day doing your thesis on North American legumes but if there are no other seats, you aren’t allowed to make like it’s weird if someone sits at the same table.  Fair?",6,1764215589.0,barista,0,1.0,False

I’m sharing something personal that I’ve been struggling with for years as an extreme introvert (borderline hikikomori) trying to build a startup. I recently wrote a short internal memo about it, and I’m posting a translated version here to hear what other introverted founders think.

# My situation

I’m an **extreme “I”**, very direct, stubborn, with strong self-belief and strong automation-first tendencies. In many ways, I’m the worst-case example of someone trying to build a startup.

Some things that are difficult for others are trivial for me. But the simplest social tasks that are trivial for others feel almost impossible for me.

I’ve always had a strong conviction in what I’m building. That belief never got shaken. But I also know I’m stuck in a loop I haven’t been able to escape.

The loop looks like this (summarized from my own notes):

1. I know exactly what I want to build and why.
2. I build fast and ship fast.
3. Nobody uses it.
4. “Okay, I should talk to users.”
   * I have maybe \~5 people around me.
   * I meet 1 person.
   * Ask for introductions. They say no.
   * Try posting online. I get reactions, but no deep conversations.
   * I feel unproductive and miserable.
5. I try to create a team so someone else can talk to users.
   * Force-fit a team.
   * Months later, people leave.
6. I grab government grants to cover payroll.
7. Grants end; now I need revenue.
8. Start doing contract work.
   * My ego tries to turn contract work into a product.
9. I make a small product for the client. They pay \~$10/month.
10. Try to expand. Fall back into Step 4.
11. Finally I say, “Whatever, I’ll focus on building again.”
12. Back to Step 2.

This loop has been going on **since 2021**.

# The painful realization

I’ve never been able to complete the *first step* properly: talking to users.

I genuinely cannot bring myself to reach out, schedule, meet strangers, and talk casually. It’s not “I don’t want to,” it’s **I literally cannot do it without breaking**.

Traditional startup advice (“Talk to users”, “Do things that don’t scale”) never worked for me. It turns out the methods I’ve been trying to follow simply don’t fit someone like me.

From my memo :

* *""The advice I’ve studied for years does not match me.""*
* *""Easy things for others are incredibly hard for me.""*
* *""I finally understand: Do Things That Don’t Scale ≠ Do Things That Break You.""*

# My attempt to define a workable philosophy for myself

Here’s what I came up with for early-stage user interviews, based purely on my limitations.

# What I think would help:

1. **Quantity over quality.** My problem isn’t lack of depth; it’s lack of volume. I need to talk to many people briefly.
2. **Arranging a conversation should take less time/energy than the conversation itself.** Right now it takes me **a week** to arrange **one** meeting.
3. **Conversations must be 1:1, 15–20 minutes, face-to-face.**
4. **It must cost no money.**
5. **It must somehow blend into daily life.** (Which I know contradicts the idea of “do things that don’t scale”.)

# A rough idea I’ve been thinking about

If I want something sustainable:

* Meetings need to be light and short.
* Zero pressure.
* Some relevance to their industry (designers).
* And ideally, one meeting naturally leads to another.

But with my cultural context (Korea), meeting someone for 15 minutes without buying anything (like coffee) could be seen as rude. So I’ve thought about alternatives like short walks instead.

Other things I wrote down :

* I need to be **physically close** when *they* want to talk.
* The meeting must be easy and enjoyable for them.
* They should feel good enough to introduce someone else.
* Almost like being “invited as a podcast guest.”
* No selling.
* Ask only high-value questions.
* Possibly wait at a cafe during lunch hours.
* Tell them openly: I’m sorry, but I can’t buy coffee.
* Start with people I know.
* After each meeting, ask: “Could you send one more person tomorrow?”
* No contact exchange; if they want to talk again, they know where to find me.
* Later, invite selected people for deeper interviews.

# Why I’m posting this

At the end of my memo I wrote:

>

So I’m here to ask other introverted/isolated tech founders:

# Have you been through something similar?

# How did you break out of the cycle?

# Did you find a user research method that fits your temperament rather than the standard advice?

Any insight or experience would really help.

Thanks for reading.

I’m an extreme “I”, very direct, stubborn, with strong self-belief and strong automation-first tendencies. In many ways, I’m the worst-case example of someone trying to build a startup.

Some things that are difficult for others are trivial for me. But the simplest social tasks that are trivial for others feel almost impossible for me.

I’ve always had a strong conviction in what I’m building. That belief never got shaken. But I also know I’m stuck in a loop I haven’t been able to escape.

The loop looks like this (summarized from my own notes):

1. I know exactly what I want to build and why.
2. I build fast and ship fast.
3. Nobody uses it.
4. “Okay, I should talk to users.”
   * I have maybe \~5 people around me.
   * I meet 1 person.
   * Ask for introductions. They say no.
   * Try posting online. I get reactions, but no deep conversations.
   * I feel unproductive and miserable.
5. I try to create a team so someone else can talk to users.
   * Force-fit a team.
   * Months later, people leave.
6. I grab government grants to cover payroll.
7. Grants end; now I need revenue.
8. Start doing contract work.
   * My ego tries to turn contract work into a product.
9. I make a small product for the client. They pay \~$10/month.
10. Try to expand. Fall back into Step 4.
11. Finally I say, “Whatever, I’ll focus on building again.”
12. Back to Step 2.

This loop has been going on since 2021.



# The painful realization

I’ve never been able to complete the first step properly: talking to users.

I genuinely cannot bring myself to reach out, schedule, meet strangers, and talk casually. It’s not “I don’t want to,” it’s I literally cannot do it without breaking.

Traditional startup advice (“Talk to users”, “Do things that don’t scale”) never worked for me. It turns out the methods I’ve been trying to follow simply don’t fit someone like me.

From my memo :

* ""The advice I’ve studied for years does not match me.""
* ""Easy things for others are incredibly hard for me.""
* ""I finally understand: Do Things That Don’t Scale ≠ Do Things That Break You.""



# My attempt to define a workable philosophy for myself

Here’s what I came up with for early-stage user interviews, based purely on my limitations.

# What I think would help:

1. Quantity over quality. My problem isn’t lack of depth; it’s lack of volume. I need to talk to many people briefly.
2. Arranging a conversation should take less time/energy than the conversation itself. Right now it takes me a week to arrange one meeting.
3. Conversations must be 1:1, 15–20 minutes, face-to-face.
4. It must cost no money.
5. It must somehow blend into daily life. (Which I know contradicts the idea of “do things that don’t scale”.)

# A rough idea I’ve been thinking about

If I want something sustainable:

* Meetings need to be light and short.
* Zero pressure.
* Some relevance to their industry (designers).
* And ideally, one meeting naturally leads to another.

But with my cultural context (Korea), meeting someone for 15 minutes without buying anything (like coffee) could be seen as rude. So I’ve thought about alternatives like short walks instead.

Other things I wrote down :

* I need to be physically close when they want to talk.
* The meeting must be easy and enjoyable for them.
* They should feel good enough to introduce someone else.
* Almost like being “invited as a podcast guest.”
* No selling.
* Ask only high-value questions.
* Possibly wait at a cafe during lunch hours.
* Tell them openly: I’m sorry, but I can’t buy coffee.
* Start with people I know.
* After each meeting, ask: “Could you send one more person tomorrow?”
* No contact exchange; if they want to talk again, they know where to find me.
* Later, invite selected people for deeper interviews.



# Why I’m posting this

Here’s the closing thought that I originally wrote for myself:

>



So I’m here to ask other introverted/isolated tech founders:

Have you been through something similar?

How did you break out of the cycle?

Did you find a user research method that fits your temperament rather than the standard advice?

Any insight or experience would really help.

1p7s1kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmAmazon/comments/1p7s1kh/how_to_choose_the_right_watercolor_paint_set_for/,How to choose the right watercolor paint set for your needs?,"Getting into watercolor painting can feel overwhelming when you're staring at dozens of different paint sets. The good news? You don't need to spend a fortune or become an expert overnight to pick the right one.

**Figure Out Your Skill Level First**

If you're just starting out, you'll want something beginner-friendly with basic colors. A set with 12-24 colors gives you enough variety without making things confusing. More experienced painters might want larger sets with 36+ colors for mixing and experimenting.

Student-grade paints work perfectly fine when you're learning. They're cheaper and let you practice without worry. Once you get comfortable with techniques, artist-grade paints offer richer pigments and better color mixing.

**Pan vs. Tube - What's the Difference?**

Watercolor paint sets come in two main types. Pans are those small dried blocks of color in palette boxes. They're portable, last forever, and great for painting outside or traveling. You just add water and start painting.

Tubes contain wet paint that you squeeze onto a palette. They give you more intense colors right away and work better for large paintings. The downside? They dry out faster if you forget to cap them.

**Check These Important Features**

Look at pigment quality when comparing sets. Higher pigment concentration means your colors stay vibrant even when you add water. The paints should blend smoothly without getting muddy or chalky.

A good palette or mixing tray matters too. Some sets include built-in mixing areas, while others need separate palettes. Think about whether you'll paint at a desk or need something portable.

**Price vs. Value**

You can find decent watercolor paint sets starting around $15-20. Mid-range options between $30-60 usually offer the best balance of quality and affordability. Professional sets can cost over $100, but you probably don't need those right away.

Don't just go for the cheapest option. Low-quality paints can actually make learning harder because the colors don't behave predictably. Spending a bit more on a reliable set saves frustration later.

**What Colors Do You Actually Need?**

A basic watercolor palette should include primary colors (red, blue, yellow), secondary colors (green, orange, purple), plus earth tones like burnt sienna and raw umber. Black and white round things out, though many painters skip pure black.

Pre-mixed sets take the guesswork out of color selection. You get a balanced range that works for most subjects - landscapes, portraits, still life, whatever you want to paint.

If you're ready to grab a quality set that checks all these boxes, [this watercolor paint set](https://athomewave.com/watercolor-paint-set) offers solid options at different price points.

**Brand Reputation Matters**

Stick with recognized names in the art supply world. They use better ingredients and actual pigments instead of dyes that fade quickly. Customer reviews help you spot quality issues before buying.

Some brands specialize in student supplies, others focus on professional artists. Both can be excellent choices depending on your needs and budget.

**Making Your Final Choice**

Think about what you'll actually paint. Doing quick sketches in a travel journal? Get a compact pan set with 12-18 colors. Planning larger studio paintings? Tubes with 24+ colors give you more flexibility.

Consider where you'll paint too. Bedroom desk setup? Any format works. Coffee shop sketching? Portable pan sets make more sense.

Your watercolor paint set should match your current goals, not some imaginary future where you're a master painter. You can always upgrade later as your skills grow.

Ready to start painting? Check out [these watercolor paint sets](https://athomewave.com/watercolor-paint-set) that work well for different experience levels and budgets.

The right set makes learning enjoyable instead of frustrating. Pick something appropriate for where you are now, and you'll be creating beautiful paintings sooner than you think.",1,1764214838.0,UmmAmazon,0,1.0,False

It actually worked pretty well. Coffee tastes fine, no strange aftertaste, and baked goods came out almost like normal sugar. I’m still figuring out how it behaves in bigger batches though.

1p7rxo6,https://imgur.com/a/9LtFf6i,($15k-$16k) Graduated! Houston/Cypress TX,"Our wedding was this past Sunday in the Houston,TX suburbs. Total guest count 80

Budgets are rough estimates from what I can remember (without looking at my spreadsheet) 

Catering:
Tex Mex restaurant - beef and chicken fajitas all the fixings and queso/chips $1577 + tip for buffet servers. This was a HUGE hit. 

Churro/Maruchan vendor: $677 (double service + new customer discount). Churros were very much loved but maruchan wasn’t sadly. I’ll explain theory of why at the end. 

Charcuterie mini boxes: <$300 DIY. Costco + Amazon for supplies. These were helpful to round out “apps” for cocktail hour alongside churros. 

Drinks:
Bar: drinks including whiskey, rum, 2 types of beer, 2 types of wine <$500. Bought beer on sale, used mix and match bundle pricing for wine. However this was a massively overpurchased item. I’ll explain later as well 

$50 Costco water. 50 gallons + packet of water 

Coffee/hot cocoa bar: <$600. This wasn’t a service my bartender had previously provided but I gave her the idea and she was down to try! Included cart, coffee, all the fixings etc. this wasn’t also a big hit. 

Bartending services: $1056 included tip, 1-2 “wait staff” who helped serve water and clean up tables at reception, bartenders, coffee bartender. All the mixers, fixings, plus ice. No alcohol. I provided. 

Decorators: $240 including tip. These were the bartenders. I wrote instructions for them and everything was type A organized. 

Venue: $4200. This was a 100% DIY venue. They only provide tables and chairs. The ceremony and reception was there. It’s gorgeous with some caveats. If anyone is in Houston/cypress (the reserve at cypress creek. Message me for details) 

Photography:$2800 included engagement shoot. She is usually $3500 plus tip but I negotiated a cheaper rate by reducing hours, no “bridesmaid get ready” shots. The cheesy kind which she did some more chill ones. Something she mentioned was she was willing to work with me because I very much respected her time but was frank with my budget and was willing to adjust to make it work. 

Flowers: DIY <$600 a few snafus here. I ordered 100 roses, 100 spray roses and 80 alstroemeria from costco with the rest coming from Trader Joe’s and a couple from HEB.  Costco did us wrong. Spray roses came in 4 days after the requested delivery date and 1 day after the wedding and they sent white filler instead of alstroemeria. They refunded the money but I had to make up for it at Trader Joe’s. I did all arrangements out of white cereal bowls from goodwill that cost .99 each. They came out gorgeous. People took them home. They take work but with some help it’s doable. Practice! I did 8 table arrangements, 1 sweetheart table which used an appetizer tray type deal, 3 bouquets (mine made of our peonies), 3 flower girl baskets with baby breathe and 5 boutineers. My recommendation would be to not be so stuck on a color scheme for flowers. If you DIY flowers you need time, help and flexibility. It’s doable though. 

Paper goods: we printed and cut everything. Place settings, seating charts, koozies, coloring mats for kids everything. 

Linen: 8 round linen, 6 rectangle linen ($140 total) 10 cocktail bar linen ($60 - Amazon) 100 napkins ($50) everything except cocktail bar linen was Efavormart + coupon codes. We tried steaming the linen- waste of time. They were wrinkled. No one cared. Napkins we prefolded and ironed ourselves. Cocktail bar linen - this made me mad. The decorators took one linen out and didn’t use the rest. Meaning we wasted $60. We can’t return that.  

Cups: $100 Efavormart. They were small but beautiful. And reusable. They were pricey but the color made for big impact on a simple display. 

Cake: HEB white vanilla fresh strawberries with whipped cream and elite icing. Simple vintage piping. It was PERFECT. It was beautiful and everyone loved the cake. <$250 for 2 1/2 sheet cakes and 1 round cake for us to cut. I don’t have a picture but attaching inspo and it came out exactly like that. No wording. 

DJ:$750

Coordinator/Officiant/month of: <$900. This was an absolute steal. I was scared she wasn’t going to be good but she was AMAZING month of. I’m also type A so I’m sure it helped her but she really killed it day of. Her husband was our officiant and everyone LOVED his ceremony. It was fun, extremely personalized and quick. Husband and wife team that truly killed it. 

Security: $350 (not sure if this is standard or we received a discount since my husband is a cop at the same office) 

The rest was miscellaneous purchases for decoration, supplies, invites ($100) etc. budget does not include dress or suit. We DIYed table numbers, mirror, absolutely everything 

Overall it far exceeded what I thought I could put on for this budget. It was beautiful. 

Regrets: this was a Sunday wedding that started at 3:30. I thought people would stay the whole time until 9. They didn’t. Most people were gone by 6:30/7 which is when dance floor started which resulted in 2 things: so much left over booze which was basically wasted because I can’t return and wasted maruchan vendor who was supposed to be our late night snack. 

Which brings me to the maruchan vendor. They was an emotional addition at the end that cost me about $250. Reason being is we had a popcorn vendor first who ghosted us. I had to rush to find a replacement and I saw both options which I couldn’t choose and by the end I didn’t care so I went with both. If 10 people ate ramen that was probably a lot. 

Another slight regret: koozies. We had some left over. Whole project was about $100 but what took the most was the time to make them and honestly it wasn’t worth it. We also made custom stirrers and those were easy and cheap. Just make those. Skip the koozies. 

My recommendation is buy little by little. Have a vision but try buying something ever week. Some weeks more than others. Goodwill, Efavormart, Amazon. It feels less of a burden when we buy a little at a time. We cashflowed everything by doing this plus setting $$ on the side for the wedding. Break your vendor payments up more. More often throughout the year. It’ll allow you to pay it off without feeling it. 
Have a good idea of what you want and focus your purchases around that. And write down every purchase. It’ll keep you on track. 

On Amazon we created a wishlist of items but before we bought I always did a run through to make sure something similar wasn’t on sale. 

Finally signage - we did it all ourselves. Design on canva, printed locally whether Walgreens or CVS. You could totally do it. Trust me. I didn’t pay Etsy or anything but if you do look for sales. They have them all the time. 

Anyways if you have questions I’m here!

1p7rpy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1p7rpy5/help/,Help!,"We have an adopted family member (28M) who was abandoned by his mother when he was around 1 yo. He isn’t biologically related to the elderly woman who adopted him, but he is my cousin because his biological mother is the half-sister of my biological mom (we are both NOT legally adopted).

Since he was a child, he has always been different. But because the elderly woman who raised us was poor and had a very traditional mindset, he was never taken for medical checkups until he had a mental breakdown in 2023 and became catatonic.

We brought him to VMMC and NCMH, and he improved once he started treatment. But he has always been stubborn. So as soon as he started getting better after 4 months of medication, he stopped taking them and refused follow-up checkups. He went back to drinking coffee and smoking and suddenly resigned from his job. Now he refuses to work because, according to him, the minimum wage is not fair.

He works on and off, never lasts long in any job because he always gets into conflict with someone. And whether he has a job or not doesn’t matter, because you can barely ask him to contribute even just 1k. And he doesnt do house chores either.

We live in the house of the elderly woman who adopted us, and I pay all the bills and buy all the groceries. Even the old woman who adopted us is the one cooking for him and doing his dishes. He just lives comfortably without responsibility and would only help when me and grandma are already so mad and shouting.

Grandma is already very old and sick so she moved in with her biological son. I'm currently jobless but I'm  still paying our bills and feeding him, together with the cat and dog grandma also adopted.

“Stephen's ointment soothed Jack's hand, the coffee soothed his jangling soul, and presently the normal sweetness of his nature made a veiled appearance, though he still remained unusually grave. ‘Your Mr Martin carries on about the harshness of the service,’ he observed after the fourth cup, ‘and although I must confess that a flogging round the fleet is not a pretty sight, I feel that perhaps he may carry it a trifle high. He may exaggerate. It is unpleasant, to be sure, but it is not necessarily death and damnation.’

'For my part I should prefer hanging,’ said Stephen.

‘You and Martin may say what you like,’ said Jack, 'but there are two ends to every pudding.’

'I should be the last to deny it,' said Stephen. 'If a pudding starts, clearly it must end; the human mind is incapable of grasping infinity, and an endless pudding passes our conception.'”

It’s not only excellent characterisation (both Jack and Stephen being so very much themselves), it’s also just damned funny.",20,1764213781.0,AubreyMaturinSeries,6,1.0,False

Like how hard can it be to make hot water and coffee grounds work together? But I’ve been seeing fancy brewing ratios and temp nonsense which honestly made my head spin. It’s a whole diff world out there for this stuff.

Don’t judge but I’ve read a lot of reviews lately and even asked too many strangers for reccs. And this [french press](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO398) seems the most suitable to me. The double insulation tends to actually work which was surprising cos most insulated stuff I've bought have been total bs.

Plus the biggest thing was realizing I was spending like $6 a day on coffee without even thinking about it. And that shit adds up fast when you're hitting Starbucks every morning cos you can't function without caffeine. This one tbh makes better coffee at home and I'm not broke by the end of the month lol.

The other thing that surprised me was how much you can actually control the taste. Like you can throw in more grounds or let it sit longer if not a weak coffee person like me. Before this I was basically stuck with whatever came out of the machine (good or bad) and just had to deal with it.
I also looked at the Bodum and Secura ones. Bodum looks nice but feels kinda fragile. And the Secura one is built like a tank but your coffee gets cold fast without the insulation.

Ok I’m not saying that it's perfect or anything. But it does what I need without any weird quirks or daily maintenance drama. And tbh sometimes that's exactly what you want from something you use every single day.

I’ve been dealing with a hypomanic episode due to college stress, and often have this jittery feeling of an elevated mood. I don’t drink coffee, or do anything else that would be triggering, (drinking, etc) so I assume the stress ive been under has been the main culprit I believe. I’ve had medication adjustments already, (but its tricky since meds can take a few months to fully work) so i’m wondering if anyone has some good tips to calm hypomania?





Ive read that exercise helps as a way to get rid of extra energy or help with stress, but ive noticed that for me exercise does the opposite than calming me down.


I saw a really helpful tip on an older post in this community though, to relax at home instead of running around to do errands. So I will try that. But if anyone has some other tips that has helped them relax, pls let me know!

Hey! I’m 25, based and working in Makati. I work in the BPO industry, so my body clock’s kinda flipped. Outside work, you’ll probably catch me playing basketball, going on long walks, or chilling at a coffee shop (I have a customized Starbucks drink that always costs extra 😅). I’m also into sneakers, cooking, and F1.

Honestly, I’m just looking for my go-to person  someone I can vibe with on coffee runs, random errands, or just be my safe space.

What I’m looking for? Simple  someone with emotional maturity. The rest? Just be you. 😉",1,1764213425.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

I moved to a different state when I had about four months of sobriety, and I’ve been in my new place for about 9 months. When I first relocated, I made an effort to get phone numbers, and I got a home group and a sponsor right away. 

There are folks who I see at meetings regularly and text with sometimes outside of meetings. I’ve even gone out for ice cream/coffee/lunch with some of those folks. We get along fine, but I wouldn’t call them “friends.” 

My sponsor tells me that I need to find my AA crew so that I have support when hard things come up in life. I hear people in meetings talk about their sober support network, and share about how deep their friendships are with other sober people. I want to cultivate that, but I don’t know how. 

I am starting to realize that the issue is me. It’s not that I think I’m unlikable or anything like that — I think the issue is that I actually don’t know how to cultivate real friendships. In the past, my “friends” were basically just drinking buddies. Now that I’m sober, I have to let myself connect with people genuinely, instead of hiding behind alcohol.

For context, Alkemia tends to be like sort of a hit or miss for me? But two of my favorite scents ( The Honoured Ghosts and Silken Tent) are by them. I usually like aquatics and florals but I find, in my previous experiences, Alkemia has never worked for me in that way. Only weird gourmands I would not normally like 😅 
ANYWAYS on with the show ✨

Dark Mysteries Set :

*Encens d’ Amour: A sensual reverence of amber-benzoin incenses, Grecian figs, white peaches, black currants, green pumpkin, coconut water, vanilla pods, star jasmine, freesia, rosemary sprigs, ripe passionfruit, and medjool dates. 
  
Much Lighter than the other perfumes in the sample kit. The Fig is not that Green of a fig but a brighter variety, almost a true sweet (but not gourmand) fig. The black currants give a tart berry note, but the Rosemary sprigs adds a nice grounding earthy note. The coconut water doesn’t come through, nor the ripe passionfruit. I think the fig and the dates are giving “the filling of a fig newton cookie” but the incense and the rosemary keep it from being gourmand, but does give it that sort of “Alkemia Perfume Vibe” which I think is just maybe their incense notes? I would wear this as a cold weather perfume, but I don’t know if I like it enough to full size right now. 4/5 ⭐️


* Gods of Mad Desire: A delirium of hashish coffee, licorice, coriander, and trampled greens swirling in an erotic maelstrom of spices, black honey, goat milk caramel, dark amber, and patchouli 

First thoughts: getting the hashish coffee, licorice and coriander and it actually isn’t as bad as I thought it would be because overwhelmingly it is giving leather jacket and aftershave. Maybe that is the patchi notes, it is not really giving any greens, trampled or otherwise. I thought it would be more overwhelming, this Is not for me but if you like a unisex patchi perfume you’d maybe like this! I don’t get any black honey or goat milk caramel, or any caramel at all. I don’t think I am picking up on dark amber either, but those might be more pronounced after some time in a dark closet. I actually think if there was a tangy caramel note it would be overwhelming in a negative way, so I don’t mind what accords I am not getting. I am just overall not a patchouli wearer, as much as I wish I was.  It smells like barbershop-ish to me at the dry down, all the licorice left the party 🎈 2.5/5 ⭐️(for me, might be for you) 


* Kabarett: A debauched chypre of black leather, pipe tobacco, cigar smoke, worn wood stages, Cassis liqueur, Brazilian Rosewood, blood oranges, flambéed pears, wilted bouquets, wine-stained satin, tonka, and rare Gesha coffee.
    
Aggressive leather scent, like the car airfreshner type. I get pipe tobacco and it’s almost minty quality, but I do not get cigar smoke. I don’t get the coffee, oranges, pears or satin, wine-stained or otherwise. I do not like this, but I will try again after a rest in a dark closet,. X/5 (Needs to be reassessed after resting) 


* North Star: A powerful solitude of night-dark woods and resins, impassive stones, frozen lichens, the electrical crackle of Northern Lights, and the saliferous petrichor of dried tears.
  
Wow, what an interesting scent. I think the petrichor is a nice scent and is kind of a lighter intensity petrichor scent of the ones I have smelled. It’s kind of giving damp moss. Someone mentioned in a different review it having a “sour” note and I think I am sensing that in very brief whiffs but I don’t get sour as much as I get “salty”, sort of the salt around a margarita almost (sans citrus). I personally don’t love the moss scent, but if you are someone who likes the moss stone green lush sort of scent profile you’d probably like this. I don’t get as much of that Alkemia Perfume (tm) note in this one, and it reminds me a lot of their “boggy” or “marine floral” type perfume samples I have tried in the past “Lilacs along the winding drive” I don’t think I like that this perfume says “wet” and “damp” and not “frozen”.  I like the idea of this perfume more than the final product, but conceptually kudos because such a cool concept! 3/5 ⭐️

* Somnium: An eventide elixir of aromatics to bring deep relaxation and restful sleep – French lavender, green cardamon, neroli, Irish moss, vetiver root, and opopanax.    
 
Very very very deep lavender, not a clean candle light scent. Like it borders on medicinal but is brought back from the edge with moss. This is very deep and green. I don’t get the neroli until after the first smell and it almost enhances that medicinal quality into like, an old timey all-purpose cleaner. I have never smelled Opopanax by itself, only in amber accords so I can not comment on that, but I can take an educated guess and say its adding a really nice roundness to the final dry down.  I can see how this could work in very very cold weather because I think in the heat this would be really overpowering and just musky as hell but in crisp snow cold I think, on the right person (I.e. not me), this would be great. Even if it’s not for me, I think it’s well crafted. 2.5/5⭐️ 

* Venus in Furs:  A luxuriance of velvety fur-musk and boudoir incense infused cashmere wrapped in a risqué sophistication of dark Turkish roses, voluminous peonies, indolic white florals, elegant lychee martinis, and a twist of candied citron.
    
So, I didn’t think I would enjoy this but I am pleasantly surprised. The Turkish roses are almost like, mint green but with just a tinge of that really intense, heavy rose.I am getting the white florals as it dries down, I still think it is less white floral than say Gucci Bloom or something, but still more rose forward. The incense and the roses are kind of playing off each other, in a nice and interesting way. I feel like it’s a more playful and flirty perfume than I imagined it would be from just reading the notes? I don’t get lychee or lychee martinis, but I do get the candied citron and I think it keeps this perfume really in balance and it plays back off the rose. This is a perfume that floral haters will not be converted over on - it is intensely perfume-y. By the full dry down. If you’ve ever tried Alkemia, especially their florals you may recognize a “perfumed” quality to them? I don’t know how else to describe it - but this perfume has THAT quality in spades. I enjoy this a lot, and it’s a nice surprise but I would not buy it. I think it may be too rose and floral heavy before anyone could even notice the more subtle citrus and cashmere notes. 3.5/5 ⭐️


Rollerball of Aurora : 
Aurora: A luminscent skin-but-better aurora of soft cashmeran, orris root, cardamon infused coconut milk, white amber, white musk, white violet, white ginger, lotus flower, and a touch of honeyed cream.

Def getting the skin scent, getting a touch of spice from the cardamon and maybe orris root together that I thought was a patchatouilli note until I saw it didn’t have one. This is a very well balanced scent, like a less gourmand Silken Tent (probably the white musks and white amber notes), I can even get some of the honey cream notes in the dry down but again, not gourmand. I don’t think I would say this scent smells “cold” but instead “warm cozy blanket and warm milk inside while cold outside” vibes, although to be clear it isn’t lactonic and the coconut milk is almost giving it a suntan lotion note. All in all this is a nice scent, sort of confusing because it seems like it would be more of a Cold Day scent, but if you enjoy perfumes that hang close to your skin it would be a nice addition. I personally wish it leaned heavier into either smelling cozy warm or lactonic because it is kind of boring as is. The longevity isn’t really more than a few hours max, maybe even less for me. I think I will try this as a layering note if I can find other things in my collection it will play nice with. 
3.5/5 ⭐️

Extra samples given for free: 

Fallen Snow Angels: A paradox of crème de vanille and devilishly dark patchouli frolicking playfully amid a flurry of snowflakes and winter ice-mint.

Very light and delicate, I thought the patchouli would overpower it all but I would say it smells vaguely like a savannah buttermint or like those soft wedding mint candies. I like it, I think it does indeed as read winter-mint but avoids coming across toothpaste-y nor overly perfume-y. This would wear well on top of other skin hugging scents to give it a nice, sweet minty mix. I might wear it with Aurora and report back. 4.5/5 ⭐️- I would get a rollerball of this. 

Afterglow: A glowing veil of golden musk, Madagascar vanilla beans, woodsmoked black amber, chai tea, spiced rumcake, and incense woods.
	
At first, I am just getting incense wood musk. I am getting spiced cake and maybe the cinnamon and clove of a spiced rum, but I am not getting chai tea outside of that. I don’t get smoke but more burnt incense notes. I think the incense is overpowering everything in the dry down, which is a shame because I was really excited to try this and the chai tea note really interested me. I would say this is just a spicy incense woody scent. Not sweet at all, I would even say this leans masculine or like Old Spice or something. 2/5 ⭐️not for me, might be for you though!

This is the basic description of the product:

“Supergut GLP-1 Daily Support is a prebiotic fiber powder designed to support the body's natural production of GLP-1 hormones, which can help with appetite control and blood sugar regulation. It is made with a blend of resistant starches and beta-glucan, which are clinically shown to boost gut microbes.

For context: I’m usually on top of birthdays. I’ve got reminders, calendars, alarms — the whole “I’m a functional adult (18M)” starter pack. Except apparently none of that matters when my brain decides to go on sabbatical.

Yesterday morning I’m sipping coffee (1M), scrolling through emails, enjoying the peace, when my wife (50F) walks into the kitchen and goes:

“So… when were you planning to say something to your son?”

I blink (0M). “About what?”

Her face drops the way a teacher’s (58F) does when a student (13M) says, “Wait… there was homework?”

She says, “It’s his BIRTHDAY.”

Reader, my soul *left* my body. I think I genuinely experienced astral projection.

I sprinted upstairs like a cartoon character, and there he was: my son, sitting on his bed (8M), quietly building Legos (92M) by himself like a tiny abandoned Victorian orphan. As soon as he looked up, I hit him with the most awkward, too-loud “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY!!” a man has ever produced.

To his credit, he just shrugged and said, “I thought maybe you were doing a surprise or something.”  
WHICH MADE IT WORSE.

Cue me panic-driving to the store, grabbing the saddest assortment of “celebration” items ever collected: a half-melted cake (0M), Minecraft (15M) napkins (we don’t own Minecraft), and a balloon (1F) that said “Congrats!” because there were no “Happy Birthday” ones left. The cashier (29M) wished *me* good luck.

We managed to salvage the day with pizza, cake, and me overcompensating like a guilty golden retriever (2F). My son said he had a great birthday, but I will be living with the shame until the end of time.

**TL;DR:** Forgot my son’s birthday, had to improvise a panic-fueled celebration, and discovered disappointment hurts 10x more when it’s in the shape of a small child holding Legos.",0,1764211536.0,tifu,26,0.14,False

I found the people in Afghanistan to be incredibly warm and all of the experiences I had with civilians there were positive. I remember these truck drivers would bring food to our base and they would ask our interpreter to ask us questions about ourselves, if we have kids ect and they were always super quick to show off pictures of their families and ask us about where we're from. I would offer them coffee from my thermos and they would offen offer me cigarettes and overall I look on that experience fondly. Another time these afghan construction workers came to our base to help reinforce a structure that had been damaged and me and another marine were tasked with supervising them every day they would offer me tea and lunch which I would decline. These experiences stuck with me because they have evey reason to hate me but have only showen me generosity. The second experience that sparked my curiosity is that my wife is a hair dresser and wanted to open up a studio but the prices were too expensive. My doctor is a older muslim man and we brought up in passing how expensive it is to open up a business and he offered to let my wife use this large spare room as a studio for free. We were really taken back by this generosity and a week ago moved in, she has been giving him home cooked brazilian food as a kind of payment as he will not take our money.

Around 28, we were having significant issues and I felt very stuck. He wasn’t happy either. I offered counselling therapy to help, but he didn’t want to. 

At 29, I decided to go travel. I’d put it off for years as I was waiting for him to have enough money to come with me, as he said he wanted to, but he didn’t save. Initially it was planned for 3 months, but we ended up breaking up 5 weeks into my travel. The split was fairly amicable, mainly initiated by me, though later he said it was the right decision but he wouldn’t have done it himself. 

I ended up extended my travel to 11 months. We kept in touch as he would give me updates about our dog. He would often check in, trying to show me how much he’d changed. Sometimes I provided him with emotional support as he lost his job and had to live with his parents. He promised when I returned home we’d share custody of the dog. 

When I told him when I was coming home, in the final month, he decided he wanted a “clean break” and no contact except for special circumstances, and unfollowed/blocked me on everything except WhatsApp. He took the car and the dog, which I’ve partially accepted now.

It’s now five months since I returned home, and 14 months since we broke up. I’ve heard he’s in a new relationship and I’m happy for him to have moved on. We live in the same city and I saw him randomly from a distance with his new partner (I assume) a few weeks back for the first time since he dropped me off at the airport before I travelled, though he didn’t see me. 

I’ve moved on, truly. I’m in a much better place now. I’m in no way bitter about his new relationship and I don’t want to get back together. I know I should give closure to myself, but I want to meet him for a final time to say things to him in person. Maybe it’s naive/entitled, but I always thought that would happen and I didn’t expect the last time to see him to be at the airport. He took the dog from me and I feel like he’s controlled the ending. I’m worried about coming across each other again, except this time he sees me too. He was my best friend and partner for so many years. I thought about reaching out, offering a coffee, so at least it’s amicable. I don’t know what to do or how to let this go. I want to give him peace but I feel an overwhelming urge to ask to finally close this chapter of my life. 

How can I manage this? Please be kind.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

For years now iv been asking for personal items ie tech slippers ect not to be left in the living space. Fo context we are a family of 3 we have survived all the usual stuff lol (me f40 husband 42 fc 10.5 lol) but have spent the last decade living in a granny flat. A space made basically for one person to live. Like it's move the bowl to get ot the plate and put the bowl back because there's no space. Like my kitchen cabinet is over the kitchen sink yeah lol 6f by 5f just part of the open plan space. We're working towards building a house for at least 6 of the 10 years. Needless to say it can get tense in the space. 

Ok so I asked everyone to put stuff away...I'm told my stuff is everywhere and I'm the way.

Like really every is in the way of everything...

But anyway my 40th birthday weekend me and the husband have a argument (ever 3-4 years we have a serious relationship changing argument) 

Basically I have very few personal items in the shared space (we each have an area in the living space for some personal items I have pills for long term illness sct. ie a rack for shoes a shelf for tables and wires etc)

Ok so in the argument he informed me that the mop bucket ( the only thing that doesn't fit in the space for them items) is infact my personal items!!! WTAF so 5 years of him telling me I also leave items in the space he ment the freaking mop! 

  
Just soak that in, I took a couple of minutes, made a coffee and had some of the devals lettuce 😶😜 I came back to him and calmly screamed at him that in fact they are not mine they are house hold items like the mugs... And that he could use it at some point.. petty but hey.

I definitely could have kept my calm but it was years of being well unintentionally gass lit 🤷 

So 

  
I didn't post this when I originally typed it out (2 weeks later)

Update

we got drunk together and talked it out he is sorry ish but everything that isn't his is mine lol 

So... male thinking is there any happening lol 

And I have accepted some of the initial delays with the house is my fault. My mom died approximately 9 years ago so I was grieving hard and spending a fair amount on that lettuce and unusualy alcohol which affects my  Crohn's disease.

  
Unusually alcohol to the rescue lol

We both feel like the same thing.

Under appreciated, over looked and his father is a big misogynist hidden in New age hippy ideas lol is was hard to figure him out because we're very similar in so many ways (people say my husband married his father not his mother lol) 

Basically I'm on a journey to be less like the dad in law less to shout I just told him I don't shout by my home standards lol like when I screamed at him I was angry when I shout at you when you get annoying to stop but I'm just looking for attention to get you to stop I'm always getting stuff done with lol. 

Ok so a long one but for my first post was itaw

For putting my every essence into the screaming? It was definitely therapeutic. I usually get the release from small wins through the day so I don't unleash on him as soon as he gets home (I am staying home with our child I'm not capable of joining the workforce ATM. Haven't worked in 10 years I had a rough pregnancy and a very bad egg topic pregnancy with 3 surgers)

Maybe over sharing but context is key.

What do we think of this

But I guess in crossing my limits or something Idk...
My husband is a nice husband tbh, so is my family, but I never felt like I can have some sort of peace anywhere. I always have to meet a certain criteria to just rest. For example at home the dishes have to be washed and anything visible to my husband that's not supposed to be there should be put away before I can go sit and maybe just get a sip of my coffee.
I had a pretty bad migraine today and my daughter got a fever too so I told my husband I'm going to my mums so I can rest a bit while everyone else takes care of my baby.... but I've noticed everyone being literally hateful now when I come... because there no place and I shouldn't come to stay and I shouldn't be sleeping in the same room that was mine before bruh..but yeah that's how it is now. Everyone saying omg here she is again even tho I rarely visit. I always thought of it as a joke but their expressions and seriousness about this matter is making my heart hurt a little....Even tho I have sjøgrens syndrome which makes my eyes completely unable to produce tears, got my eyes a lil teary. 

On the other hand, my husband does help me alot but he's always at home and doesn't work now and I'm the only one working, so instead of fully helping with household chores, he wait for me to come back to do everything. Let me just say he's gonna be back to work soon lol, but he's been home for a few months now. 
In the end if he was just to even let the mess my daughter causes just be there, I might not need to go to my mums and feel like an outsider all the time 

I didn't realise a day like this will come where I even question what am I to anyone at all.... should I expect nothing....? From people I'm wasting myself away for ...? Kinda mad ngl.

Nov 28, 2024... Thanksgiving at my sister's. Husband made his usual high-demand pumpkin gouda soup. Happy pictures. Countdown...

Dec 6, 2024...My last day of work, prior to retirement into disability. (ME/CFS, EDS, chronic complications.) Husband had been doing everything around the house (granted, I never could cook worth a ptthp) and it was time for me to stop sending my limited energy to the workplace and instead spend it on us.

Dec 9, 2024...He wished me ""Happy Monday!"" We laughed. I looked for a white elephant gift for my retirement gathering/final Christmas lunch. Found a Christmasy stuffed animal. Hubby: ""You can't give him away, he's cute!"" Took my last pix ever of husband--holding the stuffed animal. (I found a different white elephant.)

Dec 10, 2024...Retirement party. Coworker friend drove me there, and afterward, delivered me, buzzed, home to my laughing hubby. (I didn’t drink much, so when I did, it was entertaining.)

Up to Dec 24, 2024...Christmas prep. And he bought two bottles of our favorite wine for our New Years celebration. Talking about 2025 plans. Our usual 24th drive-around to see lights. Foggy, so not great.

Dec 25, 2024...We hosted family. Hubby made everything except the salad. And he'd  made more soup. That evening he says, ""Another successful Christmas!"" with a smile. Joyful. And it's such a relief I didn't have to work the next day--or ever!

Dec 26, 2024... Sister had stayed over. Her car was in the garage (he insisted) so his was in the driveway. I was sitting that morning with coffee and sister. Told her, ""This doesn't suck.""

**Time speeds up.**

...He goes out to his car; I think of something. (Now I dont even remember.) I call to him from house. He turns to respond--""Yes, daahlin'""--Slips. Hits head. We thought he was OK.
...Comes in with bad headache. He's on two blood thinners. I put coffee cup down and think, *""My lovely morning is shot. Please don't let it be worse than that.""*

It was.

-I drive him to the busy ER. ""Have a seat"". They brush aside my pleading. Twice. ""He's on the list."" And I **don't** jump up and down and scream.

-Instead, we sit. He's worse.

-Finally called--into a room with a woman on a computer. He throws up.

-Finally to an ER cubicle. He passes out. Pees. They finally take us seriously. Shoo me out. I wait. Again. My sister arrives.

-This ER is only Trauma III so they can't help.

-Flight to Trauma II is grounded. By the fog. The fucking fog.

-And...they're short of ambulances.

-Finally they get one, get him moving, and my sister drives me to the Trauma II where the surgeon finally meets us and says he could try but...my husband would spend the rest of his life in the nursing home. I have to let him go. 

We go home finally...to cheerful Christmas lights. Before we go in, I ask my sister to get the two bottles of wine for New Year's out if my sight.

She still has them. I'll never drink that wine again.

This Saturday they're forecasting a blizzard. If life was still about living, he and I would snuggle and watch out the big windows... I'll probably drink alone.

So now we have the last 2025 anniversaries and festivities that won't feel festive. Then it'll be 2026. He never even saw 2025. Unreal.
- Jan 17, 2025...his birthday. He never saw it.
- April 11 2025...our 10th wedding anniversary. This year will be our 11th. 

I lost a man who often said, ""Whatever you need, daahlin'"" and never waivered from that. I want so much to be unconscious for 5 months. And it'd be fine to not wake up then either.

Thanks for reading. Don't know how I'd keep my sanity without all the ""strangers"" here who understand so well. 💙

I am in Munster, next to another major city Osnabruck, ​ in Germany.

Which wind brought me here?

Not exactly leading the invasion of Germany, in a reversal of the landing in Normandy during WW2.

Osnabruck  city's history goes back to 1648 where Peace of Westphalia was negotiated, bringing the 30 Years’ War to an end at the Town Hall..

In today's more peaceful world, Osnabrück is sold to tourists as the City of Peace,  and a UNESCO Geopark site.

In its own way, there is an element of romance, longing and even tragedy to the tale.

But we have to go back a bit to the very beginning.

How and why I am here.

The geography books will say the area or district is in the heart of Germany’s agriculture sector.

The buyer and users of the product I have been exporting by the container loads.

And the buyers have invited me to see for myself how the product is used in the fields.

They are our biggest market for the product I am selling to Europe. That’s not counting buyers from other German towns I have yet to meet. 

Then, add in buyers in Belgium and  France.

The story then was that I had a long road ahead of me during the trip.

In my own way, Bremen is my invasion beachhead, landing and launching pad of our product in Europe.

American servicemen who served in Europe, will remember Bremen well because their Command Center is in  Bremen and Bremerhaven.

The ports of Bremen (on the lower Weser River) and Bremerhaven (at the Weser estuary of the North Sea) were also placed under U.S. control.

And the airport where I landed in Bremen is the nearest city to Osnabruck, which has an international Airport.

Soon after landing, I was whisked off for a journey by car to our destination so we can beat  the looming darkness.  

Which was where I had fallen in love with German coffee.

Without an international hotel chain to put me in, my host had chosen an old cowshed, converted into a bed and breakfast, so I can experience the real German agricultural scene.

With winter approaching, it didn't take me long to be in dreamland after putting my head on the soft, fluffy pillows.

But  it was not the sound of  cows meowing outside in the fields that woke me up from my sleep. 

It was the strong, drifting smell of strong German coffee, being brewed fresh for our  breakfast by the BnB operator's wife.

It was a feeling that went straight to my nose and heart, which remains in my memory to this day.

It left me feeling of not being able to meet or come across another love in your life that you can compare with your first true love.

So, what is so different about German coffee, I asked the Germans I met subsequently.

' German coffee is unique due to its mild roast profile.

' It is less intense than other European coffee.

' The cultural emphasis is  on ""Kaffee und Kuchen"" (coffee and cake) as a social ritual. 

' It has been woven into German culture and its history as an innovator, including the invention of the coffee filter by [Melitta Bentz](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=Melitta+Bentz&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&mstk=AUtExfD_hkVPzSEV4TWwaxfzozJtkock0lSLiIqcECMus5Zpr1U1gxjLT2oTYmQvnt5BF4OFrXo6bsZa4OVhRBU_PrS8oS_-8qExCvN-GBDGxsXKZSMvJjscohuPixv7J5SK5uyl-EJmImVLmDeKyoaGe5IQabl2q5WoH8eCxjIMtslouWs&csui=3&ved=2ahUKEwiTlZv5qZCRAxWUUGwGHVrMGOUQgK4QegQIARAC). 

' German**s value high-quality coffee**, and Filterkaffee allows for precise control over the brewing processTrying to understand the German  obsession for drinking coffee takes my  mind to trying to understand the precision assembly of their Mercs and Porsche cars, not forgetting their war machines assembly line during their WW2 conquests.

Before leaving Bremen for my next stop in Germany, I was determined to keep my promise of meeting a British girl who I had years earlier, co-founded with me an unofficial singles club during her previous posting at her country’s embassy.

She had mentioned about starting a new job as an English teacher in Bremen, and to look her up when I do stop in the city..

**Osnabrück Garrison** in Osnabruck was a major British garrison with facilities located at Osnabrück in Lower Saxony and Münster in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

In a true confessional style, she said it was a move she made to be near her present ​English boyfriend who had also taken up a posting in the same school, and they planned to get married when their contracts ended.

This is our safe space and we live with a dog and a cat.

Our best friend (23F), that we’ll call A., has always been jokingly our “baby”, because she’s younger than us. Now I think it’s gone too far.

Now we have our own apartment but we lived in a room with 4 other flatmates until last year.

When we were there, we often let her stay the night and sometimes multiple nights/weeks, because she was having arguments with her parents and having mental health issues (I have bipolar and BPD so I always had a soft spot for that). Even if we had a room and a dog, we managed to make it happen buying an inflatable mattress for her.

Everything was pretty much ok, she “behaved” and even if it was hard on us as a couple we let her stay on multiple occasion to support her. I cooked for her and everything. We maybe coddled her, but as soon as she stopped being sick we stopped that behavior, even if we stayed very protective of her, as I think any good friend should.

The last few times she slept in our room were horrible. She was ok at this time. She snores and I have severe insomnia (this was another thing that I had to endure), plus she is ALWAYS extra cold. I developed a hormonal problem cause of my meds and so I was basically experiencing menopause. The only thing that kept me sane at night was keeping a window open, just one panel.

Once she woke up at 7am (I went to sleep 2/3h before) and angrily closed it, then got in bed with me without asking (my gf was at work) and proceeded to go back to sleep and snore in my ear, so I just got up and left, knowing she would leave at 12pm. I was mad of course and complained to her, she claimed she didn’t remember any of it and apologised. But it was fine, it was one time.

There were other incidents so we had to restrain the occasions we let her sleep in.

Now, everytime she comes to our house is pure madness.

One time she came and fell asleep on the couch, and she stayed. But it was fine, it’s just one time, I said to myself.

Then the only other time we let her sleep here, knowingly, she:

•	⁠took her bleach dirty shirt (I cut and bleached her hair) and put it ON our living room armchair, bleaching the clothes underneath, aka my gf favorite hoodie that had sentimental value and the back of the armchair (we are renting, so yeah);
•	⁠melted our coffee machine handle (it was a moka, so cheap but still);
•	⁠bleached the only good towel we had left.

That morning I recieved the texts of my gf that was devastated but didn’t wanna say anything (A. Was still at our house). I was too mad so I just stayed in our room and texted her that I was awake but too upset to come out of the room yet so i let her know. Later we discussed it and she was mortified.

Now, me and my gf went to paris for three days and we had to leave our dog and kitten at home. Our dog was with the dogsitter the whole time, meanwhile she offered to stay at our house and watch the kitten, feed him and clean the litter.

My gf said it was ok since she had two cats herself, so I said ok.

When we got back, we discovered that:

•	⁠she cut herself with a bottle opener, she bled in the sheets during the night (it wasn’t serious tho), staining them;
•	⁠she turned on the radiators, with 15C degrees outside, leaving the bathroom floor flooded from the water inside them without telling us;
•	⁠she cleaned just the poop inside the litter, the whole sand was soaked in cat urine. It was a big muddy block that I had to scrub at 12am when I discovered it after a day of travel and complications, plus had to disinfect and wash the whole litterbox because that’s how cats get urinary infections and it was BAD;
•	⁠she asked us if she could invite over her mum (?)(?) to see the kitten (why would you think inviting a stranger into your bffs house when they’re away is ok??).

To add, I cooked for her every single meal and put great effort in it. It was specifically things she loved/requested and I did it with love. She never once told me what she ate and if she liked it, I had to ask.

Also, when she comes over we have to basically gatekeep things from her because she’ll eat them/drink them/use them all and leave us with nothing.

I have to also add that we are pretty much poor. We don’t have money for extra food, extra things-she-breaks/damages, and we are renting so if anything happens to the house, it’s a big problem.

She knows all of that and after every incident we told her and she apologised.

The other thing that hurts me is that sometimes I feel used. The last episode was a few months ago.

I got stitches on my hand after a kitchen incident and spent 8h in the ER. This was after I confirmed with my nurse friend that it was a necessary trip.

She calls us one day at 11pm, asking that we go to her house and take her to the ER because he hurt herself accidentally and needs stitches. Her father wasn’t home and she and her mother didn’t have the car.

So I told her, since I had this horrible experience just a few weeks later, to send us a pic but she refused. Then I told her to call the ambulance (Our nurse friend works in ambulances, he was the one to tell us that is fine since it’s free and paid by the goverment exactly for situations like this), because they give you a first assessment that could avoid an unnecessary 5h trip to the ER and also give priority if the trip is needed (messed up system, ik).

She told me “she didn’t wanna bother them”. So I got mad because why 1) aren’t you listening to me and my experience, 2) are you bothering us?? When there are ppl that will do it because it’s their literal job??

Plus the gas expense for us, the fact that it was late and we didn’t even know how they’d come back home, and my gf had to wake up early in the morning.

She got angry saying that we should have just told her we didn’t want to. Then told us it wasn’t that serious.

Idk, I’m feeling used, I’m feeling taken for granted.

For the house, I genuinely don’t know how to act. She’s a grown adult and she shouldn’t damage our house everytime she’s here. But can we ban her?? It’s an absurd situation if you ask me.

She also invited herself on new year’s eve and now we don’t know what to do, because she would be on her own if we refuse. I’m personally scared. My gf said she’s just immature because she doesn’t have her own house. But I don’t think that’s it and I’m so over it.

What can I do? Am I overreacting? I’m genuinely at a loss here. She isn’t mean and she feels guilty when we point things out, but she doesn’t change. Idk what to do, I go from being mad to feeling guilty.

EDIT Every single time something has happened I discussed it with her HARD, I am not enabling her. My partner doesn’t seem to mind and I wrote this post just because I feel very guilty about putting a serious and definitive boundary because I am surrounded by ppl that clearly don’t mind. I just feel like I’m crazy because of it, and because everytime something happens I point it out pretty harshly. But I’m done, I’ll talk to her tomorrow and hope my partner will agree to make a united front. ",2,1764209981.0,AmIOverreacting,12,1.0,False
