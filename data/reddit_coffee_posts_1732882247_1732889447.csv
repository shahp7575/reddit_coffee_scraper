I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

From the book, (Afterword): 
""What it means to be the only living recipient from Iraq, and what responsibilities it now entails is breaking my brain. I will have to live up to this honor every day until my own last breath. Yet, I know I am not worthy of it. There were so many others who are, both within the Army and elsewhere in the other branches of service. The bravest men in my platoon never received the accolades they deserved. Fallujah gave us heros like Rafael Peralta, Chris Adlesperger, Jeremiah Workman, Jarrett Kraft, Brian Chontosh, Doug Zembiec, Brad Kasal. All Marines. All heros whose actions actions stand up the measure of any generation. Fallujah was the Marine Corps fight. The Army was simply there to support. We were two battalions ‚Äì 2-2 Infantry and 2-7 Cavalry ‚Äì In a Marine Corps battle. Those troopers from 2-7 Cav, by the way, have received little attention for all they accomplished on the other side of the city beyond a Presidential Unit Citation that also went to an attached Oregon National Guard platoon. Still. This was the Corps show. The Marines are going to hate me for this. Army Infantryman gets the MOH for Fallujah? Can I say no? My life has moved on. I am a different man. This means a spotlight again, with all the accompanying chaos. I realized I could not possibly say no. It would be an insult to the president, the process, and the men who served with me, mentored me, and taught me to be a soldier.""

[From our boy on 29 Nov 2020](https://preview.redd.it/2gfcztrtku3e1.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=3280d25534b58846ba9f3f2ee38a3db7d4f86191)

We had much to give thanks for yesterday and potentially more in the coming days and weeks with respect to our Stonk! This, of course, generates some specific questions that we can prioritize in order to gain some insight into our prospective behavior over the next few weeks.   
  
Key questions for today:

1) Will we close above $30 today?  
2) Will our uptrend survive into next week?  
3) Will our uptrend survive without substantial correction into and out of 12/10 earnings?

Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME 11\/27 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/vriwfamrrt3e1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd6971329f1eaa45589bb2f1e4dc45d67033dce9)

Our trading day was tightly rangebound, not deviating more than $0.50 from a $31 VWAP/200min SMA midline across the entirety of the day. Total volume remained elevated at an impressive 12mil shares on the day, while our rangebound trading delighted scalpers and IV sellers on a number of fronts. At the same time our close at $30.89 bucked the average trend of a slightly red close on the trading day following a Call Wall breach like we saw on Tuesday.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

We had a substantial amount of near-term shifting OI yesterday up and down the options change in expectation of the Thanksgiving holiday and today's trading half day. Take a look:

[11\/29 OI Changes 11\/27-11\/29 $20-$30](https://preview.redd.it/3isyb4wqwt3e1.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=0206ba2e6f8613a503a6bfd03cc10f3c464e901a)

In our first frame, we can see between $20-$30 traders largely took profits on near-term calls, judging the risk of loss on ITM calls going into the trading half day to be greater than the risk of gain. $30 was our most meaningful strike in this respect. Over on the Put side of things, we had a high volume of contracts sold at the BID, which indicates that most of these new Put contracts at $30 and below were traded with the intention of having them expire today for a profit. This is a good sentimental sign for a close today above $30.

[11\/29 OI Changes 11\/27-11\/29 $30-$45](https://preview.redd.it/jgsdy2iuwt3e1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95d88fc15f63234f7aea39208d965e2244e9e15)

As we look up the chain to $45, we can also see a fair amount of new Call OI proximal to our recent trading range heavily populating the $31-$33 range, especially in the tight $31-$32 bracket we saw bind our trading range on Wednesday. We'll be able to visualize the effects of this new OI in our GEX data below, but here at list it demonstrates a near-term abandonment of our trading ranges below $30 and a focus on the lower half of the developing $30-$35 macrobracket. This is again a good sign for continued trading above $30 into this week's close.

[12\/06 OI Changes 11\/27-11\/29](https://preview.redd.it/yjsyp3h1xt3e1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=891bba4ca5140138c614de6190ef16be1cd5065e)

As we look into next week's expiry, we actually see a few disproportionate concentrations of new Put OI en lieu of new Call OI. Indeed, our largest expansion of OI at a given strike was the $29 Put. However, our three largest New Put strikes - $30, $29, and $28 - were all skewed toward the BID increasingly (in that order), again reflecting a BULLISH net orientation toward the underlying price in relation to these strikes, but a BEARISH orientation toward IV. I would not be surprised if these trades were opened specifically to benefit from prospective IV and Delta crush into today's probably low activity day. It'll be interesting to see what sort of OI changes we get during today's half day into next week. For now there are certainly no red flags I can discern popping up in this neck of the woods.

https://preview.redd.it/muc333yo4u3e1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0085e6e24a46606caf297defd19f3ea0da26237

The effects of all our shifts on our Max Pain strikes for the coming weeks has been profound. Wednesday's activity alone has shifted Max Pain all the way from $25 to $27 - a full dollar higher than last Friday's Max Pain of $26 at expiry. Additionally, our December strikes all universally show Max Pain values of $25. While this does not forecast much of anything precise with respect to our price action, a generally rising block of consecutive Max Pain strikes does gesture toward continued stability trading at our elevated price levels in the near future as Market Maker hypothetical/ideal optimal profitability points move higher and closer to our current trading range. It is worth pointing out, however, that OI-based Max Pain levels do not account for IV appreciation, which necessarily allows MMs to achieve a satisfactory level of profitability at significant discrepancies between our weekly closing prices and the ideal OI-calculated Max Pain values.

Verdict? Good sign for $30 this week, good sign for continued stability as we trade in our current price range.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/fptyxxdu5u3e1.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=74b22f3529fb66f24cfa7df8020b282b6715a788

Taking a look at our Daily Put-to-Call GEX ratio, we can see some additional promising signs. Some of you may notice that our data in this respect is often revised on subsequent days (somewhat annoyingly for precision purposes) based on what I assume to be our updated gamma values at market open on a particular trading day. I am not sure exactly how these values are revised by UW, but we can still process meaningful takeaways with respect to our broader trends. Wednesday's pre-market ratio was 0.22 even though today it is listed as having been 0.19. In general, our continued hovering around a 1:5/1:4.5 ratio suggests continued expected trading within our current bull trend. Nice!

https://preview.redd.it/emggb0pc7u3e1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=7307f2c169ede26a41af69e8cbe73d5da6137d5b

As we take a look at our composite MM gamma exposure across all expiries, we can see a very clear picture emerge predictive of today's trading range. Net GEX below $30 is entirely neutral at every strike all the way to $25. Our $30 Call Wall versus our current price stands out as a strong support to the downside, while we have a large and tight concentration of net Call Gamma above $30 which runs up through $33 before neutralizing in the $33.50-$34.50 hedging 'deadzone.' You can see it even more clearly in the composite bar chart:

https://preview.redd.it/saue0kzw9u3e1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=36af9d2fec71219ecafddcda32362e139a482c9a

This structure therefore projects something of a similar situation to what we saw heading into 11/22 expiry, namely that if the price is pushed down too close to $30 on the early side, it could send a signal for bullish options volume to pick up and trigger a gamma ramp into that $33.50 deadzone. MMs would likely prefer to avoid this type of situation, especially considering their cramped timeframe to walk the price down later in the day (there is no later). The obvious target for eliminating this risk is a pinning of the price in the $31-$32 range to discourage this type of dynamism in the price. At the same time, this risk might be mitigated by a lack of attention on the stock and lower trading volume due to the holiday. Our most likely fate - path of least risk and least resistance for the casino - is sideways, rangebound trading in that pocket with a close sub $31 if possible. 

Driving $30 OTM is risky given the tight timeframe to walk the price off the peak of gamma pop. So this tends towards an affirmative probability in response to question #1. 

**Technicals**

[10\/28-11\/29 4-hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/16njw40eau3e1.png?width=1493&format=png&auto=webp&s=00b4a68934fa9fa83be4551ae5b20042f08d0a87)

So far, our most predominant chart - the 4hr chart - is still showing conformity to our current technical paradigm, an upward moving channel formed by the 50-4hr SMA as a lower bound and intratrend support. While we remain bounded by this paradigm and not overextended into RSI overbought territory (>70) we do not figure to dive into a significant, paradigm-testing in the near-term. If we begin to appreciate in terms of IV in the approach to Q3 earnings and we pull away from our 50-4hr SMA, the opportunity for a larger, trend-testing correction will present itself, but it is not currently on the table.

[Sept 2020-Nov 2024 1-Day Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/xvm3m4szfu3e1.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b499592cfcc9a691a0bf9754c569702ffabfc82)

I want to take a second to zoom out a bit and take a look at our daily chart heading back to 2020 with special emphasis on key price levels in 2021 and 2022. If you'll recall from RK's birthday livestream just prior to the Q2 Earnings report, the one technical drawing he put up in front of his audience was an historic support/resistance line at $10, marking the beginning of this historic support as the bottom of the post-Sneeze sell off on the day of the Game STOPPED hearings.

If we conduct a simple historic support/resistance analysis of this timeframe, we reveal the following major pivot points in the stock price above us:

$120 - The intraday Sneeze peak.  
$65 - The intraday 'double top' of the post-Sneeze cup. Wouldn't you know, this was also the intraday high of the first pop of the 2024 Sneeze 2.0.  
$49-48 - These were the twin peaks our intraday 'double top' in 2022 and also the intraday top of the second spike of the 2024 Sneeze 2.0.  
$35 - This served as a resistance and support point of inflection within the valleys between our 2021 and 2022 peaks. It has not stood out as an inflection point in our trading since.  
  
Having overcome and so far held $30 - the resistance-inflection point on our mid-July run - $35 thus stands out as our next significant price target and point of inquiry regarding potential correction and reversal. Within our current trend and current trajectory, we project to reach the $35 area basically on earnings. If $35 is overcome and claimed as a support, it's smooth sailing to $48-49. If we initially reject $35 on earnings, a correction would likely bring us back to $30 as a point of consolidation, which should line up with the 50-4hr SMA on that date.

Some food for thought.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/9nd996bivt3e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=68967621ef043979d5356c71a4eb7ceff57b4d9b

I will reiterate my remarks from Wednesday:

With our Q3 Earnings report now officially announced by the Company to be released after market hours on 12/10 (contrary to brokerage 'estimates' as anticipated) we are now T-11 Calendar days to release. As we can see in the 5-year, 10-day Mean IV chart above, GME like many stocks has featured a two-week long IV appreciation period that has preceded earnings only to 'thump' down hard immediately following. Following the Sneeze in 2021, this resulted in a major disruption of this pattern that did not resume until the Q4 Earnings release period in March 2023. It has continued every quarter since then in unbroken regularity - including for Q1 2024 Earnings which covered the period of the 2nd spike after RK's return in June. We saw the same pattern emerge immediately after the company announced the Q2 Earnings report on August 27. IV began to appreciate slowly, moving from a low of around 70% (Schwab valuation) to an intraday high in excess of 140% before immediately thumping back down to just above its previous low over a mere two trading days.

We find ourselves in a different position presently, as our IV has appreciated steadily and almost achieved our local Sept 10 high prior to the Q2 Earnings release. Despite our price appreciation, IV has flattened out in its appreciative curve over the past few weeks. However, it will be important to monitor whether this IV effect plays out as it has for previous quarters. If IV gets extremely high, it could cause a decent volume of options sales coming out of the Q3 earnings report (unless there is some big news to counter this and drive buying enthusiasm even more).

I am monitoring this situation and will provide thoughts as we see the trend play out over the next 10 days.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Across all our data, it does look like our upward trend is going to hold into earnings. It looks like we will hold $30 as a support into this week's expiry with some likely tight trading in the $31-$32 tight gamma bracket with some potential for more dynamism \*if and only if\* there happens to be some unexpected high options volume for some reason today. Through the lens of historical price levels, I could see a test of $35 into earnings as a distinct possibility and indeed to be projected given the integrity of our current trend into that date. Our OI and GEX data also supports this projection as it currently stands.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone! And another Happy Thanksgiving to all! :)

These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here. @ MichaelTLoPiano if Reddit is down for some reason like last week.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

1h2mghd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Prestigious-Dust-931/comments/1h2mghd/how_did_15_years_go_wrong/,How did 15 years go wrong?," I have no where else to turn to and frankly at this point I have a million things going on in my head that I just need to write down somewhere private where no one knows its me. 

  
   This November I was thrown out of my house by my soon to be ex husband. We were completely fine, yes we were fighting but it was always about me needing time to myself and to find friends. He was able to leave for coffee every morning, he went to the gym 5 days a week for 3 hours, he could disappear in his home office while I watched everything & everyone. Whenever I left it caused an argument. I wasn't allowed to go to band practice even though I was two young teens ride home. I went to a book club meet and he accused me of cheating because I was gone for 3 hours. I had my life360 location on at all times, we went to a coffee shop and a bakery since the coffee shop was about to close. Those were basically our fights. I wanted time for myself, he wanted me to stay with children and always be around without leaving the house. He even took over grocery shopping which was my literal twice a month outing by myself. 

  Now I have no money, I'm not allowed to see my children, yesterday I was served divorce papers where he wants full custody without any visitation. He has removed me from every aspect of our children's lives as well as my family. Except for my SIL who he previously had an emotional affair with.. Yes I'm stupid for trying to fix our relationship after that. She has been feeding him information I believe because now all the sudden every avenue to my children have been slammed shut like a vault. I miss my kids. I miss my old life to a point. I mean I gave him my full adult life and then he turns around and rips everything away from me. 

  
 People say there are signs before these types of things happen. I honestly didn't see any. He still was intimate with me, he still did things with me, we talked every single day. The signs I saw were him just being disrespectful. Telling me that my own hurt feelings were my fault because this is the way he is. It honestly wasnt. He started going to the gym and taking all these weird supplements and injecting himself with stuff that made his whole personality change for the worse. Of course I cant request any drug screenings because he took to shaving his genial area, legs and part of his arms. At this point I just have to wait because the court system is all backed up where I am at and with children involved more parties are involved with the court. I do have a lawyer however I feel like maybe it isn't a good one because there is little to no fight in this person. Just tells me ""you just have to wait"". So far the only possessions I have are 3 baskets of my clothes that he left on the porch, a basket of personal hygiene that my SIL took from my old house and that's pretty much it. He has control over all of my belongings from marriage and I have a feeling he might be selling them. 

 I just don't know what to do. Everything is a mess and I'm just floating along the waves with no land in sight. I am in therapy (zoom sessions) and have been for about a month now with sessions 2-3 times a week. But where I live they listen in to everything so I feel like I don't get what I need completely from therapy either. ",1,1732889028.0,u_Prestigious-Dust-931,0,1.0,False

**AITAH for being disgusted and just saying OK when my Fianc√© broke up with me?**

&#x200B;

So... idk man.

I (28) had been with my fianc√© (Alex 34) since 2020. We met at a friend‚Äôs party, hit it off, and have/had been together ever since.

He finished his Doctorate in Economics just last year. Since then he has been working at the Uni. I have my Master‚Äôs in Media Sciences and decided to start working instead of going for a PhD.

Okay... so the problem is that Alex broke up with me last Monday. It was literally so surreal and honestly... just weird.

For the past few months, he‚Äôd been acting strange. He was making demands and then dropping them immediately. A few examples: he told me we were going to paint our walls back from dark green to white. When I asked why, he just said, ""For fuck's sake, forget it,"" and never brought it up again, even when I asked.

Another time, he came home and got mad because I was sitting on the couch with my head covered in a blanket (I had cramps). He was upset because I was ‚Äújust sitting there watching Netflix‚Äù (mind you, the house was spotless). When I tried to talk about it, he said, ‚ÄúForget it, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù

This kind of thing became common. Every time I tried to communicate... tried to figure out what was going on, whether it was something I did or maybe he was just stressed at work... he would just say everything was fine, but he was clearly seething with rage. I didn‚Äôt even have to do anything; he would find something to complain about (the apartment, clothes, me, work, etc.).

So, I gave him space, which apparently was also wrong. I told him I was going to help my parents with repairs for a few days, and somehow that was also wrong because he wanted to renovate the apartment too.

Then, on Monday, I got a text saying we needed to talk. I knew what was coming, and after the last few months, I had made peace with it.

When I came home, he was sitting on the couch. He didn‚Äôt even wait for me to take off my jacket before saying, ""I want to break up."" Then the verbal diarrhea started.

He told me he resented me. First, because I didn‚Äôt pursue my academic career further, even though I was capable, and he didn‚Äôt want to upset me at the time. Then, when I started making more money (since he didn‚Äôt make much as a PhD student), he felt like I should have the last word financially, and he hated it.

Mind you, I never said anything like ‚Äúit‚Äôs my money, so I have the final say.‚Äù That‚Äôs a rule he imposed on himself, and he hated it.

He said he hated our paint scheme, the couch, and even our fucking crockpot.

Then, he told me he had rejected a better PhD program to stay here because I had already started my job by the time he got the acceptance letters. Only, he never told me he had even applied overseas. He said a few months ago he checked in with a friend who‚Äôs in that program, saw how they were thriving, and decided I ruined his life. He said I had too much control over his life and that he hated the idea that I could just decide not to pay for things and ‚Äúfuck him over‚Äù (I honestly don‚Äôt even know what that means).

He also said he hated that all his friends loved me and didn‚Äôt let him vent about me.

Then he said again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù

I was floored. I had already made peace with the idea that we were ending, and it hurt, but after that rant, I was just disgusted. I looked at him, probably with a disgusted expression, and said, ""Okay.""

He lost it. He said this is exactly what he meant... that it was horrible. We had been together for four years, and all I had to say was ‚Äúokay‚Äù to our breakup?

I just asked if he wanted to stay here while he figured out where to go. He said, ‚ÄúTypical, of course you‚Äôre holding the apartment over me,‚Äù and started ranting again, so I just left.

I told my parents, and they‚Äôre also confused. My dad suggested I reach out to our landlord and explain the situation to see what options I have. I can keep paying the rent no problem myself. He covered the utilities and some subscriptions.

Just to reiterate, I never had a problem with this. I saw that he was chasing his dream, and that was more important to me than a 50/50 financial split. I make good money and am happy at my job. I never saw it as ‚Äúslaving away.‚Äù I always had the mentality that my money was our money because we were building a life together. Of course, I had my own savings and fun money, but I honestly never cared. As long as I felt he was working towards something and wasn‚Äôt taking advantage of me, I was fine with it. More than fine.

Alex is still mad. He‚Äôs going between texting me like a robot about the logistics of the split to being a seething asshole complaining about everything. I‚Äôm not even hurt anymore. I just feel nauseated by him at this point.

I don‚Äôt know. Should I have reacted differently?

Edit: Thank you for all your opinions! It was nice to get this off my chest, lol.

Just to clarify, tho. I don't feel like a victim. I feel like something happened, and my relationship just turned bad. He behaved like an asshole but that is the extent of it. Very clearly, something is going on. But he doesn't want me to be part of whatever it is, and I have to respect that.

Now I just have to detangle myself legally from him, and after that, I'll just be left alone with my ugly green wall color. I think I might also adopt a cat as my ex was really allergic.

*Dude basically hates himself for decisions he took without ever consulting you. He chose his comforts but now since others seem in a better position he is venting on you and making you the culprit. NTA but your man has a little brain and doesn't know what to do with it.*

>OOP: I would have supported im if he wanted to move away. Idk if we would have stayed together because LDR's are hard, but i would have been 100% supportive.

*I suspect he was afraid or had other reasons to turn down that PhD - or maybe never even applied, but believes he would have got it if he did - but chooses to blame you rather than acknowledge that.*

>OOP: Then I hope he meets the Telenovela star of his dreams! I prefer my boring happy life

&#x200B;

**RantyMcThrowaway**

*NTA. Dude basically said he hates you and everything about you. What are you supposed to do, beg for his love when you can find someone who'll give it to you readily? Nah. Sorry this happened and that you were blindsided, but this will be a good thing in the long run. Onto the next.*

*FWIW he sounds jealous, insecure and emotionally stunted. If what you've written is how things played out then you dodged a huge bullet.*

>OOP: He was basically doing his own renditions of ""10 things I hate about you"". Idk... I mean he wants to break up with me, why would i plead? It is done

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***

&#x200B;

**Update - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

To start, Alex moved out pretty quickly after the breakup. He has been staying with a friend, and we sorted out everything like mail, subscriptions, and the lease.

I‚Äôm also in the process of adopting a cat. Her name is Luna, but I have been thinking about changing it since my family already has two pets named Luna, a Moon, and Qamar. She is still at her foster home for now, but I have visited her a few times, and I already adore her. She is a scrappy little tabby who follows her foster mom around like a shadow, and I can‚Äôt wait for her to move in during the first week of December. I‚Äôve already gotten her bowls, toys, and a bed by the window ready.

Now onto what happened. Last week, I was out showing someone around the city. He is the son of my parents‚Äô friends who recently moved here for work. My parents asked me to help him get familiar with the area, so I agreed. It was nothing special, just walking around, grabbing coffee, and pointing out useful spots in the city.

Apparently, Alex saw us.

I didn‚Äôt even realize he was there, but later that night, I started getting texts from an unknown number. I guess he got a new number since I blocked his old one. The texts were just weird. He accused me of flaunting my ‚Äúnew relationship‚Äù in public, said I must have been seeing this guy before we broke up, and told me that everything he suspected about me was true.

I didn‚Äôt respond. I wasn‚Äôt going to entertain his paranoia. The messages kept coming though. They went from angry to desperate, with him saying things like, ‚ÄúAt least admit you were lying to me,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúWas anything about us even real?‚Äù It was exhausting and honestly a little scary to see how quickly he spiraled.

For the record, this guy isn‚Äôt my boyfriend. He‚Äôs not even someone I‚Äôm interested in. He‚Äôs just the son of family friends who needed help settling into the city. The whole thing was completely innocent, but Alex has twisted it into some kind of betrayal in his head.

What gets me is how little Alex seems to know me. I‚Äôm not the type of person to jump into a relationship so soon after everything that happened. Even if I were, it wouldn‚Äôt be any of his business. We are done. I‚Äôve made that clear.

After I didn‚Äôt respond to his texts, Alex started calling. I didn‚Äôt pick up, but the voicemails were a mix of angry rants and desperate pleas. I ended up blocking his new number too. It feels ridiculous that I have to keep doing this, but I guess this is where we are now.

Then this weekend, I went out to a bar with my friends. A few hours in, guess who walked in? Alex.

I don‚Äôt know if it was a coincidence or if he followed me there, but as soon as he spotted me, he came straight over. He was clearly upset, asking to talk, and I told him no. My friends stepped in, and thankfully, he left without causing a scene, but it ruined my night. It felt like I couldn‚Äôt escape him, no matter where I went or what I did.

When I got home later that night, I was completely drained. I had just started to relax when I heard a knock on my door. It was Alex, standing there in tears.

He started crying, saying he missed me, that he didn‚Äôt understand why I was ‚Äúdoing this to him,‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt know how to move on. It was like all the anger from earlier had been replaced with this desperate sadness. I didn‚Äôt let him in. I told him he needed to leave, and if he didn‚Äôt, I would call someone to make him leave. He begged me to listen, but I just closed the door.

I spent the rest of the night feeling shaken and honestly a little scared. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs going through. I wrote his best friend about the situation but the plea of talking to him. He said he would.

I‚Äôm seriously considering getting a new phone number and possibly even talking to someone about how to handle this legally if it keeps happening. It feels unfair that I have to go to these lengths just to have some peace, but I don‚Äôt see another option. .

*I think keep track of every call, text and VM, collect a ""paper trail"" in case you need to go the legal route. Maybe get an additional lock on your door just in case.*

*He's obviously unstable and has been for a while. Just focus on yourself and your new chapter in life, don't feed into his crap.*

**cthulularoo**

*yeah, him ""coincidentally"" running into her twice while she's out seems not at all coincidental.*

&#x200B;

**anothertypicalcmmnt**

*""Once is a coincidence, twice is a pattern."" - I can't imagine that he just happened to see you when you were out in the city twice. Definitely get prepared in case you need to file a restraining order and take legal action. Be sure to practice good safety like locking doors and windows. Maybe even preemptively tell whoever works the front desk or whatever at work to not let him in if he comes to your work place?*

*Hopefully overtime he will come to see that this relationship is completely over, and he will stop bothering you.*

***\*\*New Updates\*\****

&#x200B;

**Update2 - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

Thanks for the concern and support I‚Äôve received. I‚Äôm fine. Really. A lot of people suggested things like getting a restraining order, but I just want to clarify that it‚Äôs not as simple as walking into an office and asking for one. The process involves proving there‚Äôs an immediate danger to your safety, providing evidence like texts, calls, or witnesses, and then attending court to get approval. It‚Äôs not something you can do lightly or without solid proof.

And no, I‚Äôm obviously not getting a gun.

I‚Äôve also seen people diagnosing Alex with various mental health issues, and I want to ask everyone to stop. Yes, something is clearly wrong, but I‚Äôm not a doctor, and neither are most of you. It‚Äôs not fair or helpful to label him with something like bipolar disorder or anything else without real expertise.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt actually feel like I‚Äôm in danger. In the past month, these were the only three incidents that happened. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs actively stalking me so much as he just knew my patterns. The bar we were at is my favorite spot, and it was a party of one of my closest friends, so it makes sense that he might have guessed I‚Äôd be there. when he showed up at my apartment, he knows what time I usually get home. The city tour is the only thing that might have been more intentional, but it could also have been a coincidence that triggered everything.

Anyway, this is the end of it. Yesterday, Alex came over with his mom and one of his friends.

At first, I didn‚Äôt want to let him in, but he promised me that this would be the last time I ever saw him. I agreed, mostly because his mom and friend were there, and I figured it would be more awkward to argue on my doorstep.

When we sat down, Alex admitted that he was going through a crisis. He told me he was mad at me, but he didn‚Äôt know why. He said he doesn‚Äôt like me, that I annoy him, but that he weirdly still loves me, which is why he went crazy when he saw me with someone else. He assured me there wasn‚Äôt anyone else on his end either.

He said he felt like he was going insane. He talked about how he feels judged for being older and not being able to give me the life he thinks I deserve. He said he hates his colleagues, hates his job, hates everything right now, and that everyone and everything annoys him. He told me he feels old and like he should want kids at this point in his life, but he doesn‚Äôt, and that thought terrifies him. He said he just wants to be alone and not talk to anyone for a while.

I didn‚Äôt say much. I mostly just nodded because I didn‚Äôt know what to say.

After he was done, he told me he was leaving. He‚Äôs on some kind of mental health leave from work, and he said he‚Äôs leaving the country on Sunday. He‚Äôs going to South America to spend time in nature and ‚Äúfind himself.‚Äù He thanked me for everything and said he was sorry for how he acted. Then he just got up, grabbed the few things he had left at my place, and walked out.

His mom was inconsolable. She kept apologizing to me over and over, saying how embarrassed she was by his behavior. I told her it was okay and that she didn‚Äôt need to apologize for him. She cried a lot, and his friend ended up driving her home after Alex left.

I don‚Äôt really know how I feel about all of this. Part of me is relieved that it‚Äôs over. Part of me feels sad for him because he clearly doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with everything he‚Äôs feeling. Mostly, though, I just feel tired. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs taking steps to figure himself out, but it‚Äôs not my responsibility anymore.

*Be glad he took accountability and apologized along with realizing he was acting crazy and taking steps to address it and get away from you. That's enough. Feel relieved, feel sad, grieve the loss of him and the relationship and enjoy the time alone now. It's ok to have mixed feelings about it. It's ok to be happy one day and sad the next. Thank you for the update and take care of yourself.*

*Instead of going to South America to ""find himself"" he should find himself a therapist.*

I think my body is starting attune to the fact that it will get food at a certain time and that time comes in the evening. So I‚Äôm doing a bastardized OMAD (basically I haven‚Äôt given up a splash of milk in my Americanos). My goal for OMAD is just weight loss really, and being able to eat one big meal rather than multiple little ones. I‚Äôve already dropped approximately 1 lb per day (down four pounds today). My question is for those who do a strict Omad i e only black coffee throughout the day: what does it feel like when your body enters into ketosis / autophagy? I‚Äôm fairly sure my couple splashes of milk prevent me from experiencing that. But the first day I can‚Äôt explain it but I just felt this intense mental clarity around the 23rd hour of fasting (I also happened to be teaching at the time, so I could really note the ways it impacted my communication and delivery). It almost felt euphoric and kind of like I was high?! Am I the only one? Thoughts? ",1,1732888896.0,omad,0,1.0,False
1h2me0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h2me0p/those_damn_neon_lights/,Those damn neon lights... ,"My side of the family had their Thanksgiving yesterday. We got in town Wednesday night and have one more dinner today before we head back home on Saturday. 

Yesterday, the part I thought would be hard (attending the dinner) wasnt. I expected everyone around me to be drinking and having a fantastic time... but out of the 20ish people there, I only noticed a couple of people drinking - it wasn't because they were loud and boisterous or belligerent, I just happened to see drinks in their hands. 

I played with my kids and my neices, visited with family, even got toddlers to gather around to do a Christmas craft that held their attention for maybe 7 minutes. It was a nice time. Oh, and I ate food (something I normally don't do because I'm too drunk). 

It was the drive to our ""home base"" that was the hardest. It gets dark here around 5. The county I am from has only been a ""wet"" county for about five years so there are a TON of liquor stores.

With all the surrounding businesses closed, the neon lights of the liquor stores and bars were extra bright. My kids were with family for the night. It would be the perfect time to just ""go have a few"". But as much as I didn't want to admit it to myself, I knew I'd wake up so disappointed and most likely hungover as hell. I (at first, begrudgingly) made it back to home base, watched a ""so bad it was good"" movie with my in-laws, and went to bed. 

I'm writing this out as my husband sleeps next to me. We have another busy day ahead of us, and I'm going to start the day with some coffee, read through your posts, and pledge to get through the day. 

I've had hundreds attempts to stay sober as long as I have, but usually fizzle out around day 4. I'm really proud of myself, and that's a new and beautiful feeling. Thank you SD, so much for being a pillar in my sobriety.

My wife and I moved into her mother's large home to attempt to save money. As far as I knew her mother was financially stable and said we didn't have to pay any bills to save money. The experience was supposed to be great with her mother in law claiming she'd cook for us all the time and we'd save money on fast food etc... the time we've spent in her mother's home has been nothing short of an insane asylum. Her mother is a narcissistic dictator that if it's not her way it's the highway. Her sister who is 15F is an absolute tyrant and quite frankly a bitch that can do whatever she wants when she wants because my mother in law is never home either because of work or because of being out with her friends. They own their own small dogs that frequently piss and shit all over the house and they'll leave it there for weeks until something is said. My wife and I have been held to high standards so I expected a high standard from the mom and her daughter I was so wrong and extremely disappointed. My wife now comes into play. She lacks accountability for her own issues in our marriage. Not truly listening to me, being rude to my mother or my friends etc... I'm beyond sick and tired of her enabling her mother's behavior and not sticking up for myself. I do 3x the work I normally would after coming home I pick up dog shit and wipe up any pee the little ones have left on the floor. Then clean any trash from the 15 year old and her shitty friends. I've tried myself reason with the two of them and it hasn't worked. I relied on my wife to do the talking for me and she just sugarcoats everything to her mother. I quit my low paying job I had earlier this year to obviously save at a faster rate. But I've also spiraled into a depression living in the shit hole that I do. I'm always negative and I am always extremely pessimistic since I've been in the house which I feel like most people could understand. I've enrolled myself in counseling to try and make sense of it all and get some outside help. I was told last week that I have dont ""NOTHING"" since we moved into my mother in laws home. I have cleaned after her family more than myself, i quit my job to get a better paying job, I even got into contact with a debt consolidation company and am making payments towards my debts that I had. My wife has twice the amount of debt I do but insists she pay it on her own and hasn't really made a large dent in it for the last 9 months. Her mother in law has now moved in one of her sketchy friends who uses my computer area as a bedroom. My only source of sanity came from my games and discord communities I participate in. Not to mention without my permission my spare keyboards and mice that are extremely expensive were kept in a container and were neatly organized. To make room for her filthy friend they threw all sorts of junk on top of my things and have probably broken a few of them. There's literally a coffee maker on top of my Razer Chroma and I already can't find my Logitech G pro. I would never allow my wife to be treated like that by my mother and I think that's where the disconnect is. She holds me in a lower respect than I do her. She's now pregnant a complete accident btw. But it's happening regardless. I am considering going to stay with my own mom for the sake of my own sanity and wellbeing. I'm not sure how much more of this I can take before I lose my mind. My wife recently said she wasn't a problem in our relationship and that only the relationship and myself were the problems. I'm not sure what else I can do.",1,1732888465.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I had an appointment early in the day which meant I was coming downtown way later than usual.  I arrived at my parking lot and it's full.  Proceed to spend the next 15 minutes driving around downtown looking for a place to park, my frustration building.  Eventually I find a spot quite a ways from my building and outside; it's -25 here and so I'm not pretty angry; my truck will be an ice box when I get to it after work.

  
Walking through the tunnels to my office, I feel a tickle in my throat and clear it,

""I know what you mean""

  
wtf?

The woman walking beside me was talking to me, I said ""sorry, were you talking to me""

  
""the way you were clearing your throat, I assume that was from frustration in driving around downtown like I just did""

  
I smile, I explain that no, I just had a tickle but then asked why she was frustrated (my frustration was now entirely gone).  We walked through multiple buildings on our way to work and there was immediate chemistry.  We got to my building and I assumed she'd break off and keep walking to hers.  She didn't.  She stopped and kept talking.  The flow was back and forth and it was awesome.  I introduced myself, realizing she didn't know my name and I wanted hers.  We exchanged contact information and then I told I her I had to go.

  
Here's what this reminded me of

1.  I need to stay positive as frustrating experiences might put me on a path to enjoyable ones

2.  Never be afraid to take a chance.  I could have brushed off her comment and focused on my own shit.  I didn't.  I met someone nice and while doubtful it will mean anything, I enjoyed the 20 minutes we chatted together

3. Leave my earbuds out.  The world is waiting for us to interact with it

Couple of other inauspicious milestones ahead: the imminent arrival of my 65th birthday next week, Christmas (BLEH), and, on 27 December, the first anniversary of the death of my Dear One, one day before her birthday.

She suffered terribly from the ravages of breast cancer & chemotherapy - I'm so glad that she's no longer in agonizing pain. 

Her long decline did afford us the opportunity to have many painful conversations - including ones related to my future without her.

Thing is, even though I'm nominally ""unencumbered"" - all by myself, with grown sons who live far away from me with their own lives, I really don't know what to do next.

Even though I should be ""unleashed"" inasmuch as we had conversations about my future & I don't carry any guilt related to that - I just feel alone & lost... that I no longer have the ability to be relevant to a potential partner. 

It pains me to see other more ""mature"" couples in coffee shops, restaurants, etc. and having the realization that it's quite possible that I'll never have a connection with potenially compatible woman again.

A further complication that I'm confronted with is that I have absolutely ZERO interest in participating in the ""mainstream"" dating scene - I identify as Dominant in a consensual power exchange (Dominant / submissive) context - it's who I am... and it'd be a sure recipe for failure of a relationship to try to coax / persuade a potential female partner to engage in that dynamic if she truly doesn't identify as a submissive.  Additionally I suspect that I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum, inasmuch as my youngest son formally carries that diagnosis... and I've always struggled socially to connect with others during the course of my life.

Life is sooo incredibly random... I suppose that I have the solace of having had the love of my life (who identified as a submissive and also suspected that she was mildly autistic) ... many people don't ever experience that. Sigh. ",2,1732888183.0,widowers,2,1.0,False
1h2m5t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jvelension/comments/1h2m5t4/adair_children_of_kion_chapter_2/,Adair. Children of Kion. Chapter 2,"Una often lost her temper when she had to talk to Yak-Haf. Her brother had picked on her and teased her for as long as she could remember. Still, now as adults, his pranks never ceased. She had reached adulthood two years ago and hoped her brother would leave her alone and stop bothering her, but he didn't. His irrepressible energy, exploding against everyone around him, irritated her. As it turned out, she wasn't the only one. Yak-Haf never had any friends, although the girl noticed how much he needed them. Perhaps everything he did was just a common way to get some attention. But that didn't mean he could talk to her like that. Her brother made jokes about her whenever possible and said things that would definitely hurt her. Yesterday's words were the last straw, so she decided to return the favor. For several years, she had taken no action on his pranks. Una believed they were mature enough to act as they did when they were children.¬†

Una woke up early. Her room was hot and stuffy, causing a headache. It didn't affect her plans, so she quickly got ready for action. As the sun was just about to rise, she left her room and walked along the hallway. She heard the sound of doors closing downstairs. She looked out the window and saw Madje walking away. Sneaking quietly to Yak-Haf's room, Una leaned three fingers on his door, and the display immediately opened. Flipping through the sections, the girl changed a few settings. She changed the hot water to cold and changed the volume of the alarm clock and its sound. Changing the combination of the password to open these doors excited her especially. A year ago, her brother had installed it so that she would not return the favor for his mischief. Not a day after the password was set, she easily cracked it. Once she changed the combination to a new one, Una ran into the kitchen and started her day with a delicious breakfast.¬†

Forsa woke up later than usual. An urgent message from her mother appeared on her bracelet. After reading it, the girl felt excited because it was her first serious assignment. She had plenty of time, so she packed the essential things and went out into the hallway.¬†

Zion caught up with her on her way to the stairs. They wished each other good morning and went downstairs. In front of them appeared a satisfied and confident Una.¬†

""Good morning,"" Zion greeted her, ""Why are you so happy?""

""Oh, never mind, it's just a beautiful day.""

""Yak-Haf has got himself into trouble, hasn't he?"" Forsa laughed.¬†

""Why do you think so?"" the girl wondered.¬†

""The only time you have such a satisfied face is when you hide or ruin his things as an act of revenge,"" she replied, ""It's been a long time since you've done anything like that. Apparently the password he set wasn't that hard.""

""Maybe I changed a few things in his settings, but I don't think that's going to hold him for long. He's so smart,""pointed out the girl, trying to speak indifferently.¬†

""That's true, but something tells me it didn't stop you,"" Zion remarked, ""I hope you didn't go overboard.""

""I changed a few settings, that's all,"" Una crossed her arms across her chest and frowned.¬†

""Zion, aren't you curious how long it will take Yak-Haf to put things back?"" Forsa asked.

""Yes, but I feel it would be better if you sat down and discussed things like adults instead of acting like children.""

""Maybe, but you know he doesn't listen to anyone,"" Una said firmly, her mood had visibly worsened.

""As you wish, sister,"" Zion looked disappointed, ""By the way, Forsa, are you going somewhere?""

""Yes, Mom assigned me to check on Se-En's house. I can't believe they entrusted it to me! My first assignment! I'm supposed to be in Oihan tonight,"" she cheered.¬†

""Why didn't they tell me anything about this?"" Zion seemed confused.¬†

""Cause security is my concern, and yours is control,"" Forsa replied, pretending not to notice her brother's displeasure, ""Good thing there are still a few hours before the flight. I have a training session to do.""

""Yes, we can't do without it,"" said the frowning brother, ""Maybe you should take Una with you.""

""Believe me, I have nothing to do there,"" replied the younger sister.¬†

""What are you going to do today?¬† Stay in the library all the day?""

""Maybe in the library, or maybe I have my own business, just as important as yours,"" Una looked coldly at her brother, who only raised an eyebrow.¬†

""Something's going on with everyone's mood today. Could you stop that, please? I don't want to start the day this way,"" Forsa said.¬†

While they were finishing their breakfast, they heard the siren blaring in the house. Zion and Forsa felt a little tense from surprise, but when they saw Una sitting and smiling sweetly, they calmed down.¬†

""I also set him an equation to turn off the alarm clock,"" the girl said as she got up and headed out of the house.¬†

They decided to give their brother some privacy and left for their own business. Zion glanced up the stairs, where the siren was still sounding, wondering whether or not to go up to his brother. Choosing to keep things as they were, he stepped out into the courtyard.¬†

It was surprisingly warm and sunny outside, with not a trace of yesterday's snow. Zion decided to visit the climate department today. The young man planned to go to the white and blue building where he and his parents worked. Besides, they had rooms there where they stayed during busy times. Forsa headed to the stadium for a training session. The girl walked down the street, automatically picking the right direction and typing a message to Madje. She warned him that she would be gone for a while, reminding him that he should not forget to go shopping. Her brother always responded immediately to her messages, but not this time. To her surprise, Forsa became frustrated. Clutching the bag in her hand, she looked at the dark blue building, where the students were already waiting for her at the very top.¬†¬†

On the way, Zion took a coffee and finally headed in the right direction. The blue-and-white sail met him as friendly as ever. The people working there were starting their day with casual conversations, so he quickly passed by and stepped into the transparent elevator. He used to go to the dome in the evenings since he didn't have to discuss anything and could rest there. No need to smile and pretend to be interested when he wasn't.¬†

There were still a few people in the climate control department, lounging, relaxing in their chairs, and chatting. When they noticed him, they straightened their backs and immediately turned their faces to the monitors.¬†

""Good morning,"" Zion said.¬†

""Good morning,"" said the guy sitting closest to the entrance.¬†

""Have you noticed that it is too hot outside? What is the reason?""

""According to the sensors, everything is within normal limits,"" the girl at the window answered.¬†

""I think the information is definitely false. Double-check everything, maybe something is wrong with the system.""

""Sure, we'll do it right now,"" they smiled.¬†

Walking out into the hallway, Zion saw them frustrated as they got back to work.¬†



Yak-Haf jumped up in his bed when the siren sounded. The deafening sound kept ringing when he finally realized the point. The small monitor displayed an equation hidden behind a multitude of tabs. Furious, the guy extended the screen sideways, enlarged it, and focused on the solution. The sound of the siren was distracting and confusing, making it hard to concentrate. Fifteen minutes later, his head was already irritated when he finally typed in the answer and turned off the siren.¬†

The solution was rather odd; all the numbers he added up went in the sequence of his hotly beloved little sister's name. Chuckling at Una's cleverness, he simply recognized her sense of humor once again. He was surprised by his sister's abilities since the girl had just started to master mathematical sciences. Previously she was fascinated by biology and the preservation of species data at the cellular level. He was curious to see what she could achieve while studying mechanics.¬†

Determined to take a shower to relax from such a sudden get-up, Yak-Haf stepped into the stall and turned on the hot water. Warm jets of water poured over him for a few seconds, as suddenly the pressure became stronger and switched to icy water. The guy screamed and jumped out from under her. Immeasurable anger that had suddenly appeared quickly passed, and he laughed. He already knew who was behind all this, so he wanted to find out what else his sister had planned for him this morning.¬†

There was nothing strange until he decided to leave the room. The door completely ignored his commands, ignoring all his attempts to open it. It wasn't funny anymore, Yak-Haf was hungry and regretted not dining last night. Trying to figure out the password, the guy spent about forty minutes but had no success. Once he opened a panel in the wall, he started digging through the wires to disconnect the power, but just as he managed to do that, a secondary system was connected, and the guy did not know how to deal with it. Several attempts to restart the system had no effect. Getting angry again, he kicked the door.¬†

""Una!"" screamed his brother. At this point the girl connected to his monitor's camera. She was watching Yak-Haf's actions, sending him funny images of animals on the screen, playing songs with such fake and squeaky voice that the guy lost his temper and went over to the computer. ""Una! Stop mocking me! How do you do that?!""

""I took a couple of classes on emergency software hacking, I thought it wouldn't be useful, but here we are,"" laughed the girl.

""This is too much! Where did you even find such classes?!""

""Like I'm going to tell you! Finally you can taste all your jokes,"" smiled her sister.¬†

""All right, all right! I was wrong!""

""Are you going to quit messing with me?"" the girl asked seriously.

""Okay!""

Her thin, long fingers quickly tapped something on the keyboard, immediately switching its doors to the primary system and opening it. The voice, which came from every possible device, faded and silence came.¬†

""I don't get, I turned off the primary system. How are you doing all this?""

""Well, you have your talents, and I have mine,"" his sister smiled and disappeared from the screen.¬†

The morning turned out to be informative. The guy felt as if his classes were of no use compared to his sister's. She quickly figured it all out and easily hacked his passwords, security, and changed some software. Once he decided to devote more time to these issues, he finally left his room and had breakfast.¬†



To her delight, Una wrote to Zion and Forsa that Yak-Haf couldn't get out on his own, so she released him. Forsa wasn't surprised by such a turn of events, but Zion seemed amazed by his sister's skills. Maybe this victory would mark the beginning of a lull between Una and Yak-Haf. He was glad he hadn't gone up and helped his brother get out. Although as soon as he left the house, a bad feeling started to gnaw at him.¬†¬†

The big noisy family always brought him joy, but sometimes he was irritated that they argued over small things and hurt each other's feelings. In any case, these pranks never led to anything serious, and that is the point. Things were always idyllic between Forsa and Madje, they were nice to observe, finishing each other's sentences. Una and Yak-Haf often quarreled, but this was the first time she decided to give him a lesson in this way. Usually, she just damaged his things, so he set a password to enter his room. On the other hand, Zion tried to keep his neutrality, something he did very well. In the few conversations he had with his father, Kion made it clear that he had to be above such trivial matters. The guy felt that his father was wrong, but he never told him that. He didn't share much with his father. Maybe when the opportunity arises, they can talk openly.¬†

Finding his parents' office, Zion knocked on the door, and a few seconds later, it opened on its own.¬†

""Dad, Mom, good morning. - he greeted them.¬†

""Hello, Zion,"" Marra stood up and hugged her son. His father gave him a welcoming smile, ""How are things at home?""

""Yak-Haf and Una had another fight, but this time my sister decided to return the favor.""

""Really? What did she do?"" his father wondered.¬†

""He set passwords and security on his room door; you know. So, she hacked the door this morning while everyone was asleep. Actually, she hacked it a long time ago, managing to take advantage of it just today.¬†¬†

""And how did he cope with that?"" the mother smiled.

""Una wrote me that Yak-Haf couldn't get out of the room on his own,"" Zion couldn't hold back a smile either.¬†

""Una is very talented but give her a cue to not go overboard,"" Kion was distracted by the monitor, but a few minutes later he spoke again, ""Una managed to bypass the disconnected primary system and reconnect it. Curious, I'll have to talk to her about it.""

""That's what I think too, I didn't expect something like that,"" Zion confirmed. After a few seconds of silence, he recalled something he wanted to ask his parents, ""Have you noticed something wrong with the weather? I've already been to the climate department, they're checking out if there's something wrong.""

""We also noticed it,"" without turning to his son, Kion answered, ""I was just sending a request to the department when you came in.""

""Dad, I'd appreciate you noticing me when you know something. Or I could just visit them again. I want to follow up on this case personally*.*""

""Yes, that would be right,"" Kion said and plunged back into his work*.*¬†

""How was your trip? You came back quickly,"" Zion noticed that his father wasn't in the mood to talk, so he looked at his mother.¬†

""Obviously, our flight was worthwhile,"" Marra answered, ""the meteorite damaged one of the pillars, and Ki-No was silent on that.""

""Did he say why it took so long to fix the pillar? And what kind of meteorite was it?""

""I delivered the fragment so it should be analyzed by tomorrow,"" the mother replied, ""Well, as for Ki-No, he assures me he didn't mean to do anything bad. But we decided to send Forsa there to check it out.""

""I could fly with her*.*""

""Don't worry, she can do it, it's her job after all,"" Marra fixed her son's hair and smiled sweetly.

""But I'd like to participate too, even though the problem might be slightly exaggerated,"" Zion said*.*¬†

""You were right, Marra,"" without taking his eyes off the monitor, the father answered*.*¬†

""What does that mean?""the guy frowned his eyebrows.¬†

""Your father says we need someone who has an eye for mischief-making and who can recognize it. You know how I feel about the House of Se-En.""

""Okay,"" Zion said, but the feeling that he was an outsider became too evident to him. It happened to him a lot. If Madje or Forsa or any of his brothers or sisters were standing in his place right now, his father would be looking at them. He wouldn't have turned away from any of them toward the monitor. Zion did not know why his father treated him this way. His mother had never acted the way Kion did. It was the only thing that was comforting at times like this. Switching the subject, Zion continued, ""Do you already know where the meteorite might have come from? Are you sure it was the only one?""

""We're figuring it out now. The sensors didn't register anything, except yesterday's incident,"" Marra answered.

""All right, I should go.""

""See you tonight, sweetheart.""

""See you,"" Zion left his parents' house and went to his office. Before he reached the door, he received a red message on his bracelet from Madje.¬†

Madje quickly reached the entrance of the white and blue building, where his parents and brother were already waiting for him. The doors opened immediately. Once inside, he stepped into the elevator and reached the top floor. He felt he was moving too slowly, so as soon as he reached the right floor, he immediately ran down the white corridors toward the hall.¬†

The hall was called the meeting place, though it looked more like a spacious, bright room with floor-to-ceiling windows. There were monitors on the walls, armchairs, and tall vases with curly branches in the corners that clung to the wall and stretched up and out. Sometimes they bloomed with large red and white flowers, and at night the foliage radiated light. Probably because of their unusual beauty, Marra wanted to place them here. The previous leaders used the great hall, but everything changed when Kion replaced his father. The hall was put to other uses. It was rebuilt, and now it hosts spacious rooms for the science departments.¬†

Upon entering the room, Madje saw his brother and parents waiting for him. His mother was looking out the window, and his father was making tea near the bar on the right side of the entrance. His brother was just sitting in an armchair watching his parents*.*¬†

""Mom, Dad, glad you're back already. I have urgent news,"" Madje spoke quickly.¬†

""What happened?"" Marra asked.¬†

""We have problems. I cross-referenced the data and..."" Madje turned on the hologram on the small table in the center of the room, ""This is Si-Go right now.""

Seen from afar, the planet seemed to be spinning peacefully on its axis, but when they zoomed in, they saw what was happening. A meteor shower fell all over the surface of Si-Go. They glowed like stars as they dropped. Data on the planet indicated that temperatures were already reaching two hundred and forty degrees. The core was rapidly glowing, and the sensors deployed around Si-Go were rapidly shutting down.¬†¬†

""How could we be so unaware of this?"" Kion asked nervously, ""Why are the sensors going off?""

""Dad, Mom, it gets worse. There are two malicious codes in our system. One erases certain data that comes from the sensors, the other blinds us. I failed to regain control, but..."" Madje's hands were shaking, ""We don't have much time. This meteor shower will soon be here, too. But that's half the trouble. What happened on Si-Go is only a fraction of it. Almost all of them are coming straight at us. If they hit the core here as well, the planet won't survive.""

""It cannot be true! Our system cannot be blind!"" Kion got angry, ""It's impossible!""

""Dad, someone was plotting a coup. Don't you see that? They knew that those meteorites would break the dome,"" Madje took a deep breath, calmed down, and continued, ""I found a note about yesterday's incident. I'm sure those who plotted such a thing had accomplices who left the planet and saw what was coming, but I'm not certain they realized the scale of the disaster. I doubt they would have done it then,"" Kion gazed at his son in shock, but Madje kept saying, ""Someone systematically eliminated data so that we didn't understand anything until the very end.""

""Our shields will hold. Now the data on the shard will be entered, and everything will be all right,"" the man said angrily, ""Don't panic!""

""Kion, they won't make it. Don't you see what is happening here? It was Ki-No, I'm sure he wanted to secure only his own city, and we'd all be dead,"" Marra said quietly but firmly, ""We need to contact the representatives.""

""Marra, they'll manage to cope with it all,"" the man's lips curled, ""Why do you always suspect the house of Se-En?""

""Because you are blind to what's going on right around the corner!"" for the first time in their long life together, Marra couldn't contain herself. She didn't want to reassure Kion, so she turned her gaze to Madje, ""How much energy is stored in the primary and secondary systems?""

""It's enough for all the spaceships we have,"" he opened a map of the star system, ""The latest data showed that the only place we could go is the planet Is. I haven't considered other options, simply because we won't get there. Stations will disappear faster than you can imagine.""

""Can we find a planet closer to us?"" Zion asked. Madje looked at him as if he was seeing him for the first time. It made him irritated, but he managed to keep a low profile.¬†

""Not long ago the closest place to go was Si-Go,"" said Madje. ""Father, I'm not panicking. What I said is a fact. All you have to do is give the order. If we stay here, our shields will fall and everyone will die, even the cities in the deepest oceanic trenches. I'm not sure the planet will survive what's coming. Just stay centered, please, and make a decision!""

""The decree prohibits visiting Is..."" Kion said, but was immediately interrupted by his wife.¬†

""How much time do we have?"" Marra asked.¬†

""If we had found it out earlier, we could have done something, but in fact, the first meteorites should already be here within half an hour. I can't say for sure, since what's left of the system is operating with a delay,"" Madje took a deep breath and tried to calm down, ""Now I ask you to snap out of the torpor and get to work. Alerts have already been sent to all of you to approach the starships. We do not have much time!""



Usually, the void separates the distances between the planets, but not today. On this day, an invisible force decided to fill this space. Meteorites resembling shooting stars hurtled toward Si-Go and Una-Re. Energized, they accelerated with each passing second and approached their targets.¬†

Not burning up as they entered the atmosphere, they crashed into the ground like spears into living flesh. If the planet had been a living thing, it would have screamed in agony. Instead, lava erupted from its wounds and covered the green grass of Si-Go. The earth was convulsing, and the meteorites kept coming and tormenting the dying planet. Black smoke, ash, and gas swept across meadows, fields, and plains, erasing them from the life book. Nothing will be there when the ash settles, and the sun illuminates the planet's recently vibrant and diverse continents. A gray wasteland without life and hope.¬†

A sudden jolt shook the entire Basque. One by one, the pillars started humming with the strain of the meteor shower, exploding one by one. The barrier seemed to dissipate, and the fire spread from house to house. Black smoke crept along the streets as if it were alive. The energy vaults were blazing and radiating a searing heat. Within seconds, a flash illuminated the northern part of the city. The explosion of the primary fuel blew apart more than twenty residential buildings, burning everyone there to the bone in an instant. Small meteorites pierced the remnants of the dome, and the oxygen quickly dissipated. Hot, poisonous air filled the streets. Residents didn't have time to activate their suits, falling to the ground and suffocating. Those who managed to keep focused turned on their masks and ran into buildings.¬†

""Meteorites destroyed the station near Edal and the barrier, exploding the primary storage,"" Madje said quickly, ""What kind of alloys are those?! Where is that fragment now?""

""On the first floor, third lab,"" the father answered mechanically. His hands were shaking, unsure of what to do, the man leaned against the wall and started to crouch like a little child.

Marra ran to the window and stared at the scene with a frozen heart. Zion stood dazed with horror, while Madje tried to adjust the connection lines. The woman turned and said firmly, taking her hand away from the heated glass.¬†

""Kion, get a hold of yourself!""

""Secondary system has been successfully activated,"" the voice of the alert was intermittent. Blue light illuminated the city, covering it with a new dome, but meteorites broke through it as well. Dust started to appear in the air, shimmering in every possible color.

""Madje, if it's active, does that mean that the energy is even less now?"" Zion shouted, breaking the silence, and trying to be heard amidst the shouts of people who were running out of their offices into the corridors.¬†

""That's right,"" trying to control himself, Madje answered, ""It' s designed to be a reserve, not the main one, you see. I'm redirecting it to the ships. Everything in the city will be offline now, except for the flyers and the dome, so we can save someone! Let's go! Hurry up!""

Light flashed across the Una-Re sky, and the meteorites, like arrows, kept coming. Liquid plasma covered their entire bodies. As the clots slammed into the ground, they flew in all directions, and the smallest fragments shattered into dust as they came into contact with the new dome. It flooded the streets and advanced farther and farther. The masks and suits didn't help, and the meteor dust swirling in the air penetrated everywhere it could.¬†¬†

People wearing ordinary clothes instead of suits fell to the ground and could no longer get up. Their lungs were bursting with coughing. Every time they tried to breathe, their throats were increasingly painful. They died on the spot, suffocating in their own blood.¬†

Those who managed to escape screamed in horror because of the wounds that throbbed and burned. The skin near the mouth and nose turned black, and doctors could not reach the victims. The air in the premises became so dry that it was hard to breathe. The animals tried to hide but fell dead before finding shelter. Plants withered and caught fire in an instant. The city's sidewalks and roads heated up and collapsed, with flames and black smoke rising out of the ground.



After reading the message, Forsa heard the explosion and screams. When she looked out the open window, she saw the blue dome, and her eyes widened in fear. Small meteorites broke through the glass roof of the stadium and crashed into the artificial field grass. The girl took a few steps back and breathed deeply just as the dust filled the room. Her throat was on fire, and tears streamed from her bloodshot eyes. Gathering herself up, she rose to her knees and crawled to the belongings, which as usual, she had dropped close to her. Today, it saved her life. If she had left them in the locker room, she would have died like those at the training session. After putting on her protective mask, Forsa could finally breathe fresh air. She could barely stand up and walked toward the locker room as fast as she could. The mask didn't help much, but it made her feel a little better.

The girl closed the door firmly behind her, but the dust kept seeping in. Seeing the frightened eyes of her people, she wanted to say something to cheer them up, but suddenly the lights in the building flickered and then completely went out.

""What's going on?!"" everyone shouted at once. The panic was rising faster and faster, and Forsa tried to catch her breath. She had never been in so much pain before. Instead of tears, a few drops of blood spilled out of her eyes. She wiped them away with her sleeve and straightened.¬†

""How do we get out? What's going on?"" the crowd kept asking.

""It's all the On-Ci's fault! It was their system that failed in its only task!"" a man shouted. But when he looked at Forsa he immediately fell silent. When he saw that she was struggling to breathe and had his hand on her throat, he smirked and kept saying, ""Well? And these are our leaders? Look at her! How is she going to protect us and lead us out of here if she's already wounded? Why are you looking at me?""

""My wounds..."" the girl said hoarsely, grimacing in pain, ""won't stop me from getting people out of here. Don't make this any worse than it already is... We must find a solution and... go to the starship! We can't waste... time.""

""Are you out of your mind? Who is so insane to follow you?"" the man's eyes became sharper than any blade.¬†  
  
""You're wasting our time... spouting nonsense, whoever you are,"" Forsa stood up, took the sword in her right hand, and shoved the blaster behind her belt, ""Anyone who can walk, follow me. There are enough flyers in the parking area nearby...enough flyers to get us all out of here. Put on your suits and.... masks. We're getting out of here.""

The man smirked but followed her and the rest of the people. About thirty people came outside. Dust, ash, and fire filled the streets. The flyers were barely visible, but Forsa could easily find them. Most of them were buried under the rubble of nearby houses, and a block fragment chipped from the building.¬†

Once she counted the number of people and flyers, Forsa realized there wasn't enough space for everyone. So the vehicles were overloaded by half, preventing them from moving fast and flying high enough to avoid every obstacle in their path.¬†

Racing against the falling meteorites and fire, they rushed to where Madje had ordered them to go. They picked up a few more people hiding in the nooks and crannies, causing the flyers to move even slower. The stranger shouted at Forsa's decision to pick up more people, but she didn't listen to him. Heading toward the blue-and-white building beside which there was an airstrip, the people advanced, avoiding the broken roads and the ruined houses. Forsa had never spent so much time on the road before.¬†

The girl was afraid they wouldn't make it to the starship in time, but she couldn't abandon people to their deaths in the ruined streets.¬†

Liquid plasma covered everything around them. It was everywhere, on their clothes, houses, the ground, and in the air. Like poisonous rain, it was spraying in every direction. Forsa looked in the rearview mirror and noticed the blackened corners of her lips. The others had the same problem. Dismissing the thought for the moment, she tried to speed up.¬†



Yak-Haf got the message while still at home. When explosions came through, he was just about to go out to practice with Forsa, and a notification popped up behind him. Looking out the window, the guy saw cracks going through the ground and black smoke and fire rising in the distance. A few people were lying on the ground, motionless as if they were dolls. He reread the message, took the mask from the hall closet, and immediately put it on. Still hesitant to go outside, he hurriedly scanned the room for anything that might help him. There was nothing useful in sight. Only one solution left - a locked flyer in the garage. Yak-Haf didn't know if it could make the ride, but there was no other option. Walking straight down the hallway behind the stairs, the guy opened the doors to the dark premise.¬†



Una was at the library, flipping through articles on quantum mechanics. A sharp jolt shook everyone off balance. Right after it, there was an explosion, a deep crack in the wall, followed by an alert. The girl looked around, panic starting to rise. But as soon as the white light changed color to blue and then disappeared altogether, chaos broke out all around her. Her friends knocked her down and ran toward the starship. Una got up from the floor and fixed her dress. She looked out the window and estimated the amount of time she had. Without hesitation, she pulled out a black pendant behind the high collar and touched it. Several times Una waved her eyelashes to activate the display on the inconspicuous lenses. A few sweeps of her hand triggered the movement. The underside of her hood started to thin. The particles were transforming into the much-needed mask now. No one noticed this action amidst all the panic, which was very important to her. Impenetrable blue lenses appeared over her eyes, and her face was hidden in the hood's shadow.¬†

Una hurried out onto the ruined street. She easily jumped over rocks and blocks, but the gaps with flames protruding from the ground were difficult to overcome. Breathing heavily, she reached the white and blue building.

As she was walking up the stairs, she felt a sharp blow on her shoulder. A piece of glass slammed through the fabric of her suit. If not for it, Una might have been left without an arm. Frightened, she quickly gathered her wits and pulled the piece from the bleeding wound with trembling fingers. The suit pieces came back together, hiding the deep cut on her shoulder. She held something like a crystal in her hand, only with light in its core. Putting the meteorite in one of her hidden pockets, the girl stepped inside the building and made her way to the third lab.¬†

At the same time, Yak-Haf got into his flyer and tried to open the gate, but it didn't budge. Going out without protection was not an option, and he didn't want to wait either. A sharp jolt shook the ground, and a deep crack went through the house and nearby road. Realizing there was no time left, he drove the flyer away from the exit to the back wall. The flyer rushed forward at top speed, breaking down the doors and taking Yak-Haf out under the remnants of the blue dome. Avoiding looking at the ruined houses, the guy directed the flyer upward and flew to the rescue spacecraft as fast as he could. Flying over one of the distributors, the guy felt a sharp jolt. Fire burst out of the pride of his people, the technology that had kept them safe for so long. The flyer was thrown upward and drifted to the right. The explosion force flipped the machine, and the guy crashed sideways into one of the ruined houses.¬†

His eyes became veiled, and his eyelids closed. Consciousness started to slip away from him. Someone ran up and started shaking him to bring him to his senses, but another explosion came nearby. The man who had tried to save him flew to his left like a puppet.

Barely, Yak-Haf managed to pull himself together. His mask was shattered, and his head was buzzing with intense pain.

Black smoke covered the entire street, sparkling slightly in the light. The lungs were burned, and the guy started coughing. Every time he tried to breathe in, the coughing only got worse. There was nothing left to do but hold his breath. One, two, three. His ears bled, and the seatbelt jammed. Four, five, six. He tried desperately to control himself and detach the damn strap. Seven, eight, nine. Yak-Haf removed the interfering and no longer useful mask and tried to break free. Ten, eleven, twelve. It seemed as if the heartbeats were counting down the remaining time. Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. He struggled to free himself and collapsed onto the shards of the shattered roof of the flyer. Unconsciously taking a breath, he convulsed and coughed again. The entrance to the building was so close that he was almost saved. His eyes reddened and started to bleed. Trying to control himself, Yak-Haf slowly crawled out from under the vehicle and walked toward the entrance. His eyes, mouth, and nose were bleeding, but he kept moving forward, holding his breath.



Kion and Marra, together with their sons Madje and Zion, had already activated the spacecraft and were taking in the victims. The few children were crying with fear while their mothers tried to calm them down. Just as the dust started to seep into the building, masks were issued to everyone, but it was too late. Coughing could be heard everywhere.¬†

""Mom,"" Yak-Haf barely made it out when he saw Marra in the crowd.

""Oh, my sweetheart!"" the woman couldn't help herself, and tears of despair streamed down her cheeks, ""I had no hope, I had no more hope!""¬†

""I'm fine,"" he could barely speak, ""Can I help?""

""My darling, I don't know, are you sure you're all right? Your eyes,"" Marra couldn't finish the sentence.¬†

""Tell me,"" the son grunted.¬†

""The co-pilot is still missing, and there's no time to look for him,"" the woman hugged her son as tightly as she could.¬†

""I can do it, Mom.""



Una hurried up the stairs. A few more flights of steps, and she was in front of the entrance to the spacecraft. The door was open, and several more people ran inside with her. Looking behind her, the girl knew there was no way back.¬†

Not far from the entrance, she met her father's gaze. He stood motionless, staring at the mask in front of him. The corners of his lips were blackened, just like everyone else on the ship. The girl hesitated to approach him at that moment. Her mother was talking to Yak-Haf, and her brother looked terrible, but he firmly held back the pain. His face was streaked with blood, but there were no visible wounds. Just as he left, Una stepped up and hugged her mother.¬†



Forsa and the others made it to the building. As they flew to the entrance of the spacecraft, they finally felt safe.¬†

While the Unarians were fleeing, volcanoes woke up all over the planet and spewed lava mercilessly while the spacecraft, as well as small ships, left orbit and headed into space. Only On-Si and the western territory remained on the planet. Marra held her daughter tightly to her. Tears streamed down her cheeks more and more, she could no longer contain herself.¬†

There was a loud rumbling sound throughout the city. The deep crack opened up in flames and crossed all the streets, going beyond the city. The air was completely blackened with smoke and ash.¬†

The doors of the spacecraft closed noisily as the last survivor hid in its shadows. Yak-Haf and the first pilot activated the turbines powering the vehicle, and as they shone with blue light, the spacecraft headed upward at high speed.

There's so much to choose from and I really don't know where to begin, I've been trying to look this whole morning. Trying youtube and searching this subreddit.

¬†

I live in the Netherlands and I'm looking for a machine preferably below ‚Ç¨1500, but with a hard limit of ‚Ç¨2000. I already own a DF64 gen 2.

I don't need a dual boiler since we don't ever do milk drinks. Most of the time I‚Äôll just do 2 back to back shots, once a day. It's nice if it can do some form of pre-infusion and it already has a 9 bar OPV. If not, being able to easily adjust it (more easy than changing a spring). Being able to reuse my basket, tamp and umikot from my current GCP would also be great.

Preferably no ‚Äòeco‚Äô setting, I‚Äôd like to be able to use a smart plug to turn it on and off. I have a routine in home assistant that looks at my calendar and switches it on before a morning shift.

On most machines it‚Äôs not really obvious (unlike on the GCP) they‚Äôve got a solenoid, but I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôd be there on the more high end machines?

Also a matte black/grey and built in shottimer would be NTH.

¬†

Some context.

¬†

I love espresso. About 1,5 years ago I bought a GCP, with the plan to turn it into a gaggiuino (PCB V3), which I did about a year ago, replacing a Philips Saeco. Even after a year I've been struggling to get a decent cup of espresso and honestly, my wife is sick of it having to see my sour face everyday, and suggested me to get a decent (not the brand, I wish!) espresso machine. I'm just not sure if it's the machine (sometimes I have to reboot it to work properly) or something else.

I get my beans from a local roaster, mostly medium/dark to dark. This morning my espresso was again sour, while yesterday it was tasty. Same grind size, temp, coffee in and out and consistent shot time. A lot of the times espressos come out ranging from acidic/sour to battery acid, and I've tried a lot of coffees and settings. Ranging from turbo shots to very slow shots and different ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. I mainly tend to stick to a flat 9 bar profile.

For each bean I figure out the dosing by using a coin to see if there's enough headspace. I backflush the machine every time I used it, which is mostly once a day, pulling 2 shots. Every 2 weeks I backflush with cafiza and every 3 months I descale with citric acid. I have a bottomless portafilter with IMS barista pro basket and also replaced the shower screen for an IMS.

I'm grinding the beans with a DF64 gen2. Distribute coffee with an umikot and tamp with a normcore self-leveling tamp. I've tried chucking the beans in in one go and slow feeding the beans. I don't RDT.

Before the DF64 I had 2 other grinders. A 1Zpresso K-Max and after that a Baratza Encore ESP. I had hoped with the upgrade to the DF64 I would be finally done, but no such luck. The only thing I can think of is maybe try distilled water instead of tap, but we have relatively soft water.",1,1732888052.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I feel like The Jaunty Goat has quite a good rep as a local independent coffee shop and its always super busy, but when my friend asked me the other day 'what's the worst job you've ever had?', this was top of the list without question.

I've since remembered some other bullshit things that happened while I was there, so wanted to post a bit of a rant, and hopefully give people a bit of an idea about what the place is really like.



I was hired as a KP, and immediately noticed that it was very clique-y. The front of house staff generally weren't interested in talking to you if you worked in the kitchen, and the owner definitely favoured them. All of the managers were FOH which caused some issues when they tried to tell the chefs how the kitchen should be run, even though none of them had any experience working in kitchens.

There's also no staff room - so if you're on your break you're allowed to sit out front if its quiet, but if its busy you have two other options. First is the tiny stock room which has no chairs, you simply have to perch on one of the fridges, but this also doesn't really work if its busy, because people are constantly needing to get in and out of there. Your second option is to sit out the back, outside, with the dumpsters. And if its busy and rainy? Good luck finding somewhere, I guess.

If you do work there, you also better hope you don't get sick because there will be no support given if you do. One of the girls I worked with in the kitchen got a migraine mid-shift, so she took some painkillers and asked if she could take 5 or 10 minutes. After she came back, she said she really did need to go home as she wasn't well. The manager basically told her she could go home, but not to bother coming back if she did. 

One time I had Norovirus (which if you've ever had, you'll know it's absolutely awful and also very contagious). I spoke to my doctors, and they said under no circumstances was I to go to work until 48 hours after my symptoms stopped, especially as I worked in a kitchen.

I texted one of the managers and said I wouldn't be able to come in, and explained what the doctor had told me. They were very unhappy with me, and told me that I needed to find someone to cover my shift (sidenote: an absolutely terrible policy. If I'm throwing up, the last thing I need is to be calling/texting people begging them to cover my shift). I couldn't find anyone to cover me, and told my manager that. She said if I couldn't find anyone, I'd still be expected to come in myself, and if I didn't, they'd treat it as a no show (I didn't go in, but seriously, way to care about the health of your customers). 

They also regularly held meetings outside of everyone's working hours that you weren't paid for. These were always planned very last minute, like the day before, and if you couldn't make it you'd get in trouble. 

The owner was also a horrible person. He'd come in regularly throughout the week and I'd serve him his breakfast, but after a year of working there, he still didn't know my name or recognise me at all. He's also vegan, and was very disapproving and rude if you weren't vegan too. One of these out of hours meetings involved him showing us a documentary about veganism. 

He also came up with the idea of 'zombie cleans', which is basically just a very thorough deep clean, but the expectation was the whole team would come in and be there until midnight, and at the end of it we'd be so tired we'd be like zombies.

I came in one day to be told there was supposed to be a zombie clean that night which I hadn't been told about. It got to closing time, and none of the other kitchen staff turned up (I presume they weren't told about it, like I hadn't been). I was scheduled to do a regular deep clean that night which usually only took about an extra hour, so I figured I'd just do that and call it a day. 

I finished my cleaning and clocked out, and was about to leave when the owner came in and asked 'where do you think you're going?'. I said I'd finished and was going home. He then made me follow him back to the kitchen so he could inspect my work (which I'd done very well, by the way). I guess he was annoyed I was leaving earlier than he'd expected me to be, but couldn't find much wrong. He pointed out that there was some crumbs in the divot of a screw, and said I needed to stay to clean it and check over everything else. 

I moved to go out front to clock back in, but he said I didn't need to clock back in as it would only take me 5 or 10 minutes, and stayed to watch me clean so I couldn't go clock back in. I was only 19 at the time, so I definitely wasn't confident enough to stand my ground, but the absolute ridiculousness of the situation pisses me off to this day. 

  
Combine all of this with no holiday pay, no sick pay, no tips (unless you're a barista), and the incredibly high staff turnover, and you've got one of the worst places to work in Chester.",5,1732888028.0,Chester,0,1.0,False
1h2m2sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jvelension/comments/1h2m2sx/adair_children_of_kion_chapter_1part_two/,Adair. Children of Kion. Chapter 1(part two),"Marra watched the night sky through the window of the flyer. Her sharp eye stopped at every building, road, and nook of Oihan, the capital of the southern lands. Mixed forests used to flourish in this region. They were so vast that there was no end to them. The landscape was quite different now. Some parts of the city had edges that didn't reach more than two meters up to the sky. In contrast, the coniferous vines were fine in the artificial climate and, just like in Basque, braided everything they could reach.¬†

Tiny houses were lined up in circles around a six-story, scarlet-colored house, a representative of Se-En. The building was square, with a circular glass roof where Ki-No kept a collection of telescopes and other things that had something to do with space.

The first circle of buildings around Se-En's house consisted of a school, stores, various establishments, and a theater. The second circle of houses was populated by Ki-No's cronies and his first assistants. The third circle belonged to the clans, who were constantly engaged in law and order as well as in guarding. The rest of the ""circles"" were distributed by the ordinary inhabitants of Oihan. As in Basque, the last circle was followed by small towers holding columns that receive and distribute the primary energy. A dome stretched up to the sky just beyond them.¬†

As they flew toward Ki-No's house, Marra noticed the darkness just where the light of another column should have been. The woman assumed that they arrived with the inspection at a very opportune time.¬†

The flier landed near the house's entrance, and a tall, middle-aged man with jet-black hair immediately walked out to meet them. The white glow of wires stretched over all the buildings illuminated his face. The distinctive feature of all Se-En representatives is violet eyes; now, Ki-No's eyes were shining with friendliness, with a smile on his lips.

Ki-No walked quickly to meet Marra and Kion.¬†

""What an honor it is to see you in the southern lands! How was your flight?"" the man asked, trying to pronounce each word carefully.¬†

""We got here quite fast,"" Marra replied.¬†

""What a pity you arrived so late. In the daytime, I could have shown you much more.""

""Ki-No, this is an unscheduled inspection. It has to take place at the most inconvenient time for you,"" Kion said tiredly.¬†

""Of course. Come, I'll show you anything you want,"" the man let them pass ahead, pointing to the open doors of his house, but Marra didn't make a move.¬†

""So far, I'm not interested in anything other than a dormant pillar on the other side of the city.""

""Your visit occurred at a bad time,"" Ki-No frowned his eyebrows. ""I mean, the pillar was damaged, inopportunely,"" the man corrected himself, seeing Marra's chilling stare.¬†

""Explain,"" Kion said briefly.¬†

""A few hours ago, an unknown object breached the dome and crashed into the pillar. As you can see, we have already repaired the barrier, but the pillar is still under repair works.""

""Do you know that the dome's load is increasing because of its malfunction in that part of the city? Do you realize the threat this poses to everyone in the city?"" Kion's voice sounded worried. While he was talking, his wife stared at him without blinking an eye.¬†

""Yes, I completely get it,"" Ki-No answered, lifting his head. ""The people in charge of fixing it will arrive in a couple of hours, and the problem will be solved.""¬†

""Take us to it. Right now.""¬†

""Sure, Marra.""¬†

Marra didn't like to come here since the house of Se-En always made her distrustful. History already knew the case when its representative revolted against the house of On-Si. This happened during the New Age in the year 10680. The leader of Una-Re, Karin, was killed during the rebellion of the house of Se-En. Though the rebellion was put down, it caused a great impact on the power of the On-Si. Karin's daughter, Davia, was like her father by character, so after two thousand years, she allowed the Se-En family to regain power through marriage to the house that replaced them in the southern lands.¬†

Marra saw the same qualities in her husband, so she tried to counterbalance his weaknesses. However, even her efforts were sometimes not enough. When Kion's father, Eskuin, ruled, the latest changes in the decrees were adopted, making them stricter and more uncompromising. Given the nature of Una-Re's people, that was really the right thing to do. The only thing Escuin could not foresee is that such conditions create people who want to escape from the vicious circle of rules and conventions. The second thing Escuin didn't expect was that his son would be the exact opposite of him. Kion was raised under the order of a well-established system working autonomously, and all he had to do was to keep an eye on it. Under such circumstances, nothing could seem to go any other way. This gave rise to groundless self-confidence in his wife. Even before they started their life together, the woman knew who her soulmate was and realized the burden that would fall on her shoulders. Sometimes Kion was too capricious, but he really wanted to help his people.¬†

Ki-No walked slightly behind her, and his smugness spoke with duplicity that Kion kept ignoring. While trying to follow his every move, Marra wondered why this man hadn't reported the incident. The woman felt relieved to have taken the right advice and come here today. Ki-No made her feel unsafe since his friendly smile and joy masked a deep hatred. It wasn't evident unless one gave it a close look. And she was a better watcher than anyone else.¬†

A small tower on the edge of town stood in darkness. In its normal state, it radiated light. All the machinery was spinning, and the monitors were working. Now, the building greeted them with a cold blackness.¬†

Kion raised an eyebrow and looked at Ki-No with displeasure. He immediately spoke up.¬†

""As soon as it happened, I immediately sent you a message,"" trying to avoid eye contact with the leaders, the man said, ""But as I see, you didn't get it.""¬†

""Tell me the details of the accident,"" said Kion.

""A meteorite breached a hole in the dome and flew straight into the pillar. That's all we know.""

""Are you sure you sent us a message? Such an event and no one has even heard about it,"" said Marra while examining the room. ""Do you maintain work standards in our absence?""

""Of course! Everything was running like clockwork!"" the man furrowed his eyebrows.

""Did you get the meteorite?"" Kion rejoined the conversation.¬†

""No. It's still in the mechanism.""

""This is irresponsible! Your job is to organize the repairs and transfer the material that has penetrated beyond the barrier. Where are the employees in charge? What could have delayed them? Perhaps your house should be displaced if you can't ensure the southern lands work properly?"" Marra said with the same cold voice.¬†

""Marra,"" Kion tried to reassure his wife, but she ignored him.¬†

""Ki-No, should the On-Si clan be concerned about your neglect?"" she gave the man a cold look.¬†

""No, that isn't necessary,"" he replied without averting his gaze, ""The repair team should be here any minute.""

""Since it won't take much time, should we wait for them together?""

""Of course, Fra Marra,"" Ki-No gritted a respectful reply through his teeth.¬†

""Great,"" said Kion. ""While we're waiting, I want you, Ki-No, to note that checking for damage is not that difficult. You should probably learn to do it yourself, so you don't have to spend so much time looking for a repair team.""

""As you wish, Domi Kion,"" the man replied angrily. ""If it would be appropriate now, I would like to consult with you.""¬†

""Speak,"" the couple said simultaneously.

""This is the first time a meteorite has broken the barrier. Therefore, I want to convene a council to resolve this problem with the rest of the house.""

""That's not necessary,"" answered Kion.¬†

""I don't think so. Such things are unacceptable. If the dome can't support our normal way of life, we should resolve this issue at the meeting.""

""Ki-No, this is the first barrier failure since its inception,"" Marra remarked. ""If we are going to convene a council, we should discuss that you delayed several hours in repairing it and failed to warn the rest of the city of the danger. What happened is a matter of the highest importance, isn't it?""¬†

""Fra Marra, you are right. There is no reason in gathering the council.""¬†

""So why do I feel that you are not honest in your thoughts and have shown disregard,"" Marra pressed on him.¬†

""If you're referring to what my ancestors did, I can assure you there will be no such mistake,"" the man's face remained impassive, but his eyes narrowed to slits, ""I assure you.""

""Okay, but this question remains open, and as for the meteorite: it must be removed immediately and sent to our institute. We will put its elements on the impenetrable list, "" Marra said loudly. ""You will also receive a visit from our solicitor shortly. He will be here as long as it takes. Consider him your attendant, just not subject to your authority. Should he find any trouble, you will be punished, as our law says.""¬†

""May I ask who is going to come?""

""You will find it out upon his arrival.""¬†

Just as Ki-No said, within half an hour, a team arrived to repair the pillar. When they entered the room, they immediately noticed the leaders and looked inquiringly at the representative of the southern lands. He discreetly nodded to them so that they bowed to the rulers of Una-Re and started to work. Under the watchful stares of Kion and Marra, they dived into their work. Quickly discovering the cause of the failure, the chief mechanic pointed out the parts that needed replacing.¬†

After asking everyone to leave, Marra removed the culprit from the mechanism. The woman put the shard in a special container and looked at it carefully.

""What do you think?"" she asked her husband.

""It looks like an ordinary crystal, just like a mountain crystal. But I've never seen anything like it before. Look,"" Kion pointed at the meteorite, ""it seems to have energy inside, shimmering with different colors.""

""I can't wait to study it,"" Marra curiously said.¬†

""I think we'll figure it out tomorrow.""¬†

""Didn't the sensors detect something like that in space?"" asked Kion loudly as Ki-No approached them.

""No, I don't know anything about that.""¬†

The couple decided to leave the room and head back to their flyer. Ki-No hurried to his family as well.¬†

Once she was already sitting in the back seat, watching the water surface, Marra initiated the conversation that had been bothering her.¬†

""Kion, even a child could fix it. Why did he hesitate?""

""I didn't like it either. I don't know what the matter is or what he's been doing, but it's worth talking to him,"" for the first time in a while, Kion spoke seriously. ""Who are you going to assign to monitor Ki-No's work?""¬†

""As I said, Zion is not the only one who can deal with such issues,"" Marra tried to soften her gaze, ""I want Forsa or Madje to take care of it.""

""But why? I think it should be Zion. It will be good for him to get on the case.""

""I'm sorry to say this, but Zion won't be able to see anything suspicious.""¬†

""What makes you so sure?""

""Who do you think sent us here? Yes, it was your daughter Forsa. You're dead wrong if you think all she's doing is training. Her goal is to be the future leader's head of security, so she has to know everything that's going on, and she's very good at it.""

""I had no idea she was capable of such actions,"" Kion was silent for a few minutes, and then he continued. ""Okay, why, Madje?""

""He is perceptive, knows how to stand up for himself, and is completely independent in his actions. He does not need to be constantly directed and controlled.""

""Tell Forsa to go to Oihan. I think Madje would rather stay in Basque and continue supervising his projects.""

""Agreed, then Forsa,"" Marra was quiet for a moment and then continued, ""Ki-No said he wouldn't allow any of his ancestors' mistakes to happen again. Didn't that sound suspicious to you?""

""I don't think we should jump to conclusions,"" Kion tried to smile, ""We'll let Forsa check it out, and then we'll make our decision.""

""I'll tell her she should be in Oihan by tonight.""

""Why so quickly?""

""I don't want Ki-No to have much time to hide what we are not supposed to know.""¬†

""I still think you are rushing to conclusions.""

""It's better to be like this.""

Madje woke up as soon as Edal light started shining through his window. The monitor showed some messages that woke the young man up with a slight vibration of his wristband. Several more sensors were damaged. Just as he was about to read the report, he found that it was no longer available. The notifications had disappeared as if they had never existed. Frowning, the guy quickly got dressed and went downstairs. Everyone was still asleep when he went outside and headed to the Coral Building on Pink Street, just behind their house.¬†

The hallways were still empty, so apparently, he was the first to arrive, as always. Usually, this would have pleased him, but today he needed people who worked here and could clarify the reason behind the disappearing alerts. Nothing like this had ever happened before, and it bothered him. His anxiety was so strong that he wandered the hallways and looked into every office to find someone, but it was too early.¬†

Entering one of the rooms occupied by the observers, those who monitor the readings of Edal and the primary system, Madje saw a young girl still sleeping. Her thick brown hair was loose down her back, and her long eyelashes covered her slanting eyes. She fell asleep at the table, with her head resting on her right hand. Her eyelids were twitching slightly, so she was probably sleeping very lightly.¬†

Madje walked up to her and touched her on the shoulder. The girl flinched, her dark blue eyes opened wide, and she quickly started to speak.¬†

""Hello! I wasn't asleep, I just closed my eyes for a second. I'm going home right now. I'm sorry!"" the girl muttered. She rose sharply, knocked the data carriers off the table onto the floor and immediately reached down to pick them up. Her thick hair completely hid her face. Madje leaned over to help her.¬†

""Why are you sleeping here?"" the guy frowned his eyebrows and handed her some carriers.¬†

""Thank you. I'm sorry! I stayed since I wanted to practice a little longer. This is the only place I can reproduce any solar system simulations.""

""Don't worry, take as much time as you need, but don't forget to rest before your shift. Do you know where the duty officers are?""

""No, I haven't seen them. Maybe they're on break. It's worth checking the break room.""

""Good. Go home, get some rest.""¬†

""Yes, of course, Madje,"" the girl looked away, trying to avoid looking into the guy's eyes.

""What is your name? I almost forgot to ask.""

""Irma.""¬†

""I haven't seen you here before. How long have you been working in this department?""

""For over seven years now.""

""Weird,"" Madje looked into her eyes, and it seemed to him that the girl was more nervous about the situation than she should be.¬†

""No one notices me. I'm already used to it.""

""Irma, I have to go now, but I'll be back later. If you're still here, I'd like to talk to you. Otherwise, I'll find you tomorrow.""

""I'll wait for you.""

There was no guard in their office, as well as in the break room. Getting angry, the guy opened the camera tapes on his computer and started checking them out. The two guards on record just stood up and laughed their way out of the building a couple of hours ago. After sending them urgent messages, Madje folded his arms across his chest and stood waiting. After a couple of minutes, he received a reply saying that they were sorry and would be here soon.¬†

Fifteen minutes later, the front doors opened and some less cheerful guards rushed into the reception area.¬†

""Where have you been?"" he asked sternly.¬†

""We went out to the night coffee shop,"" the girl honestly confessed.¬†

""I don't care about that. You know what you're supervising here, don't you? Or do you want an easier job?""

""No, we get it, but things are always quite normal here, so we decided to go out for a while,"" the man excused.¬†

""If ""for a while"" means more than two hours, then I must be missing something in your work. Moreover, according to your work rules, you can't leave the observation post together,"" trying to contain himself, Madje said. ""Get back to your work, I need a full report starting last night and up to this moment...""

""Are you looking for something particular?"" the girl interrupted him rather nervously.

""Yes,"" Madje furrowed his eyebrows, ""I want to know what the sensors detected and whether they work properly.""

""Okay. We'll do it and send everything to you.""

""Just don't make me wait any longer,"" he commented sarcastically and went to his office.¬†

In his office, Madje reflected on the life they led in their gated towns. He was told that some people initially felt confined, but later they accepted it and managed to enjoy their seclusion. Those who couldn't accept it ventured into space.¬†

How would people act if everything around them stopped working? How would they organize their lives? These thoughts suddenly crossed his mind. He tried to ignore them and smiled over that foolish thought.¬†

Sometimes silly thoughts might be a distraction from the sad ones, but the simple truth was that someone had infiltrated their system and deleted the alerts. If Madje hadn't looked at the monitor immediately, he probably would have missed the breach.¬†

Half an hour later, the report was ready, so he looked through the data eagerly. There was no doubt that the sensors had been damaged, but still, there was a lack of data to get the full overview. Madje realized someone was trying to hide something, so he immediately dismissed the thought that he was exaggerating the problem.¬†

All the stations worked autonomously without any interference. At first, people worked there, but there was no need for that now. At least, that's what they all thought. Evidently, they were wrong. In other words, self-confidence is in all its glory. If someone had been there, he could have been contacted to clear up the situation.¬†

Leaning back in his chair, Madje decided to look at the situation differently. While checking the incidents over the past few days, he found only one short note. It was about the barrier breach in the southern lands. Just one sentence, nothing more. It was suspicious. Madje tried to find something about it, but no information was available. There was no record of who had repaired the barrier or what parts had been damaged. His parents' information indicated that a new kind of meteorite had been brought to the Institute to be added to the list of impenetrable materials. That's it. There was nothing else.¬†

An irritation wave pelted him from head to toe. It wasn't enough; there had to be something else! The guy slapped his hand on the tabletop and turned his face toward the solar system map hanging behind him. The planet Si-Go emerged before his eyes, becoming the solution at such a difficult moment.¬†

Chapter 1(part one),"The first silver threads flowed through Kion's hair. He looked at himself in the mirror and smiled at his reflection. Such a long life, so much done, and the halfway point of his life journey was already reached. The man decided not to stress about it, so he turned around, chose a suit and quickly got dressed. He liked that his clothes were as soft and supple as water, but they were not as simple as they looked. Once you hit it, the fabric was stronger than any known material. The elastic white suit, proper for going outside the city and spaceflight, fit him perfectly. He slipped a cloak of the same matte color over his shoulders and glanced at himself in the mirror again. Satisfied with his appearance, the man smiled at his reflection. A transparent bracelet flashed on his wrist, indicating that it was time to leave his rooms. Silently, a woman approached from behind and hugged him.¬†

""Marra,"" the man smiled, turning to his wife, ""I didn't hear your footsteps. Perhaps this time you'll tell me how you manage to catch me off guard.""

""Maybe some other time,"" she said calmly but her eyes were laughing.

""You say that every time,"" Kion smiled and kissed his wife.

""Yes, indeed. Are you ready?""¬†

""As you can see, yes.""¬†

""Let's go then, we have a lot to do.""

""A few more years and we can finally take our time,"" Marra hesitated upon hearing her husband's words and took his hand.¬†

The woman touched the door with her fingers, opening it at once. The couple walked out into the hallway and headed straight for the office, where they spent most days, except when they had private meetings scheduled.¬†

""Don't you think Zion is too young?"" Marra said. ""You were much older when you took over Una-Re.""

""You're right. If I remember correctly, I was one thousand four hundred and fifty years old back then,"" Kion sighed, ""Your concern is justified, but if you believe Zion can't handle it, I'm ready to wait as long as it takes.""¬†

""I think we should wait.""¬†

""I expected otherwise. For over a thousand and a half years you and I have been in charge of Una-Re. To tell you the truth, I couldn't wait for Zion's appointment,""¬† the man got frustrated. He could have argued with Marra, but he realized that rushing things like that was irresponsible. ""How are we going to tell him, since he hopes for the opposite?""

""We should talk to him when we get a chance. The thing is,"" the woman added even more quietly than she'd spoken before, ""I think we need to consider other children, too.""¬†

""According to the law, only the oldest child gets the title of Una-Re leader, you know that, right?""¬†

""Kion,"" Marra frowned her eyebrows and stopped talking, ""Let‚Äôs talk about it later.""¬†

""Darling, if you have something to say, you'd better say it now. I don't want to wait until tonight.""

""Honey, we both know we don't need to accept each other's views in everything. But now, while we are alone, I want you to know that you have beautiful children and each of them is worthy to take our place. Zion is not the only one.""¬†

""I think there's something you're not telling me. Perhaps we really should discuss it tonight,"" Kion smiled and embraced his wife.

Another day started at dawn and ended well after midnight. As soon as they reached their workplace, countless tasks would overwhelm them‚Äîinspections and conversations with the heads of the planet's southern, western, and eastern parts. Usually, if the morning started with minor tasks, something serious and time-consuming would be expected by noon. Kion only hoped that there was no reason to be late again or fly to another part of the planet. That didn't often happen since they could easily talk to any of the representatives of this or that part of Una-Re, but sometimes their personal presence was needed. Day after day, Kion and Marra fulfilled their duty to their people and tried to resolve as many issues as possible. No one wanted to see a repeat of the exhaustion, the worst time in their civilization.¬†

It happened over sixteen thousand years ago, but the Unarians haven't forgotten that time. Children were taught all the details of the history of those days so that from a young age, everyone knew the cost of disrespecting their home. The technology that ruined the planet was only the beginning. Virtually all of the previous potential and progress was wiped out, so they had to start creating everything again.

It was getting harder every day. The exhausted land was full of deserts that were expanding rapidly. Mass extinction of all kinds of species swept across Una-Re. The water boiled under the sun's heat, a disease capable of killing everything with no exception that took away many lives. Never before had the Unarians felt so much guilt for their complacency and carelessness. The echoes of the tragedy were so strong that many hesitated to have children. Although they had long been surrounded by nothing but peace and security.¬†

The eldest son, Zion, was born one thousand four hundred years later, as Marra and Kion led Una-Re together. After him, Forsa was born, and then all the other children. Along with the rebirth of the Una-Re people, the endangered animals slowly rebuilt their populations in special protected reserves. In places where the protective barriers did not extend, there was a red-hot desert with cracked earth. Constant gas emissions poisoned everything around. Some parts of the seas, lakes, rivers, oceans, were also protected by the barrier. Water passed through filters built into the dome, being purified of toxins and saturated with oxygen. It was truly one of the best inventions. But still, there wasn't enough energy to purify the entire planet.¬†

As technology advanced, the light of the sun managed to completely replace fossil sources. Not far away, in outer space, they built stations that continuously stored and redirected energy to Una-Re. The second pure energy source they used was the power of the elements. Heavy clouds kept sheltering part of the restored Sharp Sea from the south, and the spires attracted and gathered them in one place, catching the web of thunderbolts. This scene was magnificent; Marra had never seen anything more beautiful, at least she felt so. The barrier stretched across the seafloor and rose far into the sky, where night-black clouds clustered. In just a couple of years, as the system was tested and approved, sea eels, as well as all kinds of fish populated that part of the sea. Their evolution took a dramatic leap enabling them to easily carry lightning discharges. Moreover, some of them used the charges for protection or hunting. These days, a station was under construction not far from the sea bottom. Madje, the fourth child of Marra and Kion, supervised the project. He thought it would help in the study of flora, fauna, and underwater currents. Recently, unique mollusks with shells appeared on the sharp rocks, both reflecting electricity and collecting it. They covered everything down to the bottom and created a natural lighting of even the deepest cavities. Long, almost transparent white algae grew near the bottom. They looked like hair, that' s why they were named ""Hair of Kai"" after Una-Re's white satellite. When Kai was fully visible, the algae started to emit a fluorescent glow. Marra was happy that there were such places on the planet that made her think there was something magical in this world.¬†

Entering the spacious white office, Marra and Kion sat down in their cream-colored chairs. A keyboard glowed on the surface of the glossy desks, and a holographic monitor appeared in front of them. Some more calls were added to the to-do list for the day. To Marra's delight, this meant that family night was going to take place. Smiling to each other, the spouses got to work.¬†

A few minutes later, their assistants arrived in the building. It was tall with flowing white and blue lines, resembling the sail of a ship that had once sailed the seas and oceans. There were exactly the same two high-rise buildings next to it, only dark blue and coral.¬†

The dark blue building housed the school, the university, the library, and the stadium. In the coral building, there were all sorts of scientific departments, while at the very top, there were rooms occupied by the observers of the station near Edal. A team responsible for the secondary system created by Madje was stationed not long ago.

The city was surrounded by a two-meter fence that oozed energy upward. The barely visible dome overlooked the dead land that the Unarians were slowly rebuilding. It was a monument to their irresponsibility and a reminder of what carelessness leads to.¬†

The city and the lifeless wastelands created a sharp contrast. Many people ignored it, while only a small fraction tried to do something about it. Year after year, the dome expanded but not as quickly as it should have. Madje expected that in the future, his team would manage to purify the atmosphere and the water part of the planet by combining the two sources. His project was in its infancy, but according to his calculations, once all the physical properties had been purified and restored, the dome would no longer be needed.¬†

Far up in the sky, levitating blocks sparked from the electricity transmitted from the high-altitude entry into the damaged atmosphere. This technology was activated only in the event of a failure of the primary power source. People simply called it secondary, and the solar fluxes were referred to as primary.

Marra was always proud of her children's efforts. Even without knowing it, they brought her joy and strength for each new day. No doubt there was a lot of work ahead, but the fact that her children were ready for it was undeniable. The woman hoped that the reign would soon pass to the next leader. At the same time, Marra felt responsible for all people and did not want to pass on power based only on the seniority of the children. This role should be taken by someone who can really handle it. Neither too gentle, like Kion, nor too cruel, like the ruling ancestors of On-Si.¬†

Her children had different characters, goals, desires, and aspirations. Each was strong in his own way, but not everyone could become a leader. As she witnessed Zion's fiery eyes as a student in medical school, it seemed to her that this was his place. He was kind to everyone around him, attentive and responsible. His experience on one of the starships on an expedition toward Annot, one of the giants of their system, gained much publicity. A group of Unarians was exposed to a heavy dose of radiation. Zion found a way to save each of them. They are all alive because of him. His good heart rejoiced over the fact that he didn't falter or hesitate but simply did what he had to do.¬†

However, one day, the woman noticed how her eldest son was changing. It all started when Zion announced his training to become a leader. There was confusion and sadness in Zion's eyes. After all, he was so young back then, just as he is now. Such a young heir had never before been entrusted with this position. The starting point was the news that he would have to leave his career as a doctor. Now, the daily work did not bring him joy, but he buried these feelings so deeply in himself that in these twenty years, he managed to forget what he really wanted. Unfortunately, according to the laws of Una-Re, he had no right to refuse.¬†

Yak-Haf, their third son, and their youngest daughter Una suffered greatly from the lack of parental attention. Unfortunately, Marra could not change that. Yak-Haf had trouble relating to people since he was a child, so Zion was able to keep an eye on his brother with mixed success. Yak-Haf's priority has always been to become a ship's captain and go on a mission to explore the distant planets of the system. Ever since he was a child, the dark-haired, noisy, and naughty boy spent his days running around the house and playing all sorts of games he made up himself. Usually, he was a pilot navigating between furniture as if they were asteroids, satellites, and planets. Yak-Haf turned up the music in his room loudly and jumped on the bed, imagining that there was no gravity around him. His energy was often out of control, but with the help of Forsa, his older sister, he managed to burn it. The boy quickly got the hang of the hall and learned how to wield his blades. Few people could keep up with him, rather being scared of him. In fact, he got so involved in training fights that Forsa had to stop him several times.¬†

Things were easier with their fourth child, Madje. He was quiet and calm. The boy spent hours reading books and could quickly find his way through any situation. He enjoyed helping his older sister, Forsa, take care of Una when she was a baby. The elder son and daughter had nannies when they were children, but once they learned to take care of themselves, Kion sent them away. The man reasoned that children must be self-sufficient. The house was at their complete disposal, and so were the duties. Over time, Zion and Forsa took over the care of their younger brothers and sister.¬†

One rare evening, when the whole family was together, little Una said her first word. Frustration pelted Marra like cold water. The little girl stretched out her arms toward her sister and called her mother. The woman could not utter a word, unable to hold back her tears. Kion, on the other hand, simply laughed and kept on doing his business.¬†

Their children became adults and independent people long ago, but Marra could feel how much she and her husband had failed to give them. At the same time, Kion saw no problem with that. His parents, just like himself, were always elsewhere.¬†

The man seemed relaxed and easygoing. Every day was scheduled according to a strict plan. He had been bored by routine for the last two hundred years, but nothing more.

On Una-Re, adulthood came at fifty-five. Reaching this age, most people headed off to travel among the stars, while others opted for the sciences. After so much hardship and suffering in the past, Unarians tried to enjoy every moment of their new life. This attitude spread from generation to generation and would likely become an integral part of their lives.¬†

Kion, who was born and raised on land, adopted these traits from his ancestors. In contrast, Marra was not like him. That was probably the only reason Kion's father approved of their marriage. Most likely, Escuin saw in her the support his son needed. Her family had little influence, so the woman had been working hard since she was a child, but deep inside, she knew that none of that mattered. She only craved a large family that would be as strong as the earth's crust. Her fate was decided by chance. While still in training, the leader's young son fell in love with her without memory, so although she did not want it, she had to accept his advances. Marra's mother, a woman of the old modes, considered that as a chance for both her daughter's and their family's promotion.¬†

The clan was never promoted; it faded into oblivion, as did many others like it. They remained stardust beneath their feet, unnoticed behind the splendor of the four dominant houses. Now, looking at her husband, Marra wondered how her fate would have turned out if she had not listened to her mother. Why had she become what she was? After all, she desired something completely different! Where are her cozy home and happy children? Where is her loving husband, who shares her views, who can stand by her? Kion loved her as much as he could. But he remained deaf to her wishes and ignorant that deep inside, she was distant from all the day-to-day business. In fact, she only wanted to be near her children. Probably because of this, she was often so cold to those around her.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Ruling house efforts yielded results, and the world became a kind of paradise for the last millennia. Technology coexisted with nature and did not interfere with each other. All new building projects had to integrate into the environment first so that not a single surviving tree was damaged or the animals were not affected. One of the strictest rules was not to disturb the restored wildlife and plant worlds. The first leader of the On-Si clan, Katara, decreed that in case of violation, there would be immediate execution. In the early years, when there was not enough food to eat, there were attempts to steal the crops grown with such hard efforts. All men who committed such violations were immediately beheaded. In order to keep order and supervise the execution of works in large territories, Katara appointed representatives from the most influential clans.¬†

The western lands, led by the Da-Sa house, took over cattle breeding and fertilizer supply. The capital, Yerzhan, was always noisy. Its people were friendly and cheerful, holding feasts and tournaments on every occasion.¬†

The southern parts of the planet, where the Se-En house ruled, were engaged in farming the restored territories. The eastern oceanic lands were responsible for creating spaceships and all kinds of land vehicles. In addition, many scientists studied aquatic flora and fauna.¬†

During the time of the second ruler of On-Si, Isari, new technologies prospered. There was a race among the houses for new breakthroughs in science. The On-Si people tried their best to keep pace, but something bad happened. Isari's husband, Wan, died while testing the new pillars, which were supposed to expand the barriers greatly. Isari was desperate and looked for the culprits, as she was sure that mistakes in her husband's calculations were simply impossible.¬†

The perpetrators were found. Without trial or formal declaration of guilt, the leader came to them in the middle of the night to avenge her spouse's death in person. But they got lucky enough that their ship managed to leave Una-Re in a fight. According to records, the pursuit ended with the death of all fugitives. The name of this house was immediately blotted out of the planet's history. Some Unarians asked for an explanation without grasping why Isari would use such medieval means to punish an entire family. As a reply to all questions, Isari crucified all who disagreed with her.¬†

It was forbidden to talk about what happened on her orders, and the events were removed from the database. This piece of history was erased from the memory of those who had seen it, and the new generations did not know about it, and they could not even find any mention of it anywhere.¬†

As time flew by, Isari was succeeded by her son Karin. His reign was short, but he is remembered as the antipode of his mother. He was a generous and kind-hearted guy who managed to do a lot of good things while smoothing over his mother's mistakes. Kion and Zion were just like him. But Yak-Haf shared all his facial traits; even his smile was the same. Karin's holographic image glowed at the entrance to the Institute, as he was the one who founded the training system that was still in use today.¬†

The study proved to be such a fascinating experience that even the laziest children showed interest in learning. As they made their way through their studies, they chose their specialty. Those who wished to devote their lives to research preserved data and embryos in sufficient quantities to recover any species on their home planet in the future. All oceans, seas, lakes and rivers, all deserts, steppes, forests, and all living organisms were in the database of the On-Si clan ship. Most of the remaining people decided to travel through the planets and ocean depths, which is no less fascinating.¬†



As Edal, the sun of their solar system, disappeared below the horizon, the capital of the northern Basque lands was covered by the black captivity of the night sky. Close to the sun, there were circling stations that transmitted energy streams every second to the pillars in all the cities. Beneath them, in the ground, there was a seemingly complex system of saving, transmitting, and distributing. They stretched from house to house, from one ship to another. Because of the light that the poles and wires emitted, the cities needed almost no illumination. Only some places had lanterns and lamps.¬†

Edal disappeared, and Kai shone with a cold white light. Outside the dome, there was a sandstorm emerging, which could last for days, but the barriers did not let it pass through. In the beginning, it disturbed the people, but after a while, everyone got used to it and didn't pay any attention to the buzzing noise.¬†

The cities had beautiful and dense grass, while outside the cities, the soil was dry, exhausted, and lifeless, stretching for many kilometers. For sixteen centuries, no wild animals had walked through the desert lands.¬†

Zion liked to stroll by the barrier in the evenings and climb the steps up to the dome. It stretched far upward and ended somewhere near the mesosphere. The long road extended further and curved around the town. It allowed to walk around all of Basque, going simply forward. The evergreen branches of lianas, planted at mother's insistence, stretched out on either side. The whole city emitted a soft sunshine, bustling with life, something that was perfectly visible from the perspective, where usually no one walks. As he approached the closed, transparent platform, he looked out over the dead land. The tops of the sandstone cliffs seemed to be hidden in mist, but Zion knew it was just another burst of methane and black smoke from the cracked rocks. Upon his will, the wall of the dome could turn on images of what was happening at the moment far beyond his gaze. Usually, he was curious about the world, which seemed alien and unreal, but now he didn't feel like it. The day was more difficult than ever, not physically, but mentally. There were many days like this, so in the evenings he was attracted to some quiet and remote place where he could be alone. In the daytime, Zion tried to absorb all the details of his parents' rule, participated in the life of the citizens, and diligently learned everything that might be useful for his future. He would rule the wounded world, currently undergoing a new ascent again. In a hundred years of his life, he had already learned and done much, but he was still a child by the standards of his people. However, Zion felt ready for the transfer of power, something that should not pose a problem for him.

""Why are you staring into the distance, brother?"" he heard quiet footsteps behind him.""Did you see something new?""¬†

""Una, I didn't expect to find you here,"" Zion smiled at his younger sister. The girl wore a matte white dress with a hood and long sleeves that covered her hands. The fabric seemed thinner than silk, but it protected her from temperature changes. The material was better than the warmest fur coat their people used to wear thoughtlessly, but even on the hottest day, it made you feel comfortable and light. ""It's so quiet here, and this is the first time anyone has decided to keep me company since I've been coming to this place.""¬†

""Did you have a hard day?""

""I can't remember when my days haven't been like this.""

""I get it. Maybe we should take a day off. What do you think?""

""That's out of the question. How long will it take us to fix this if everyone follows your advice?"" the guy pointed toward the dead zone.

""I'm sure Madje will have a solution soon. I heard he's doing simulations, trying to combine energy sources,"" Una stepped to her brother's left and took off her hood. White as snow, her hair fell to the waist, and her green eyes were alight with curiosity. ""I'd love to see tall, sky-high, dense tree edges.""¬†

""I hope your wish will come true soon,"" said the brother and turned his back again.

""I hope so,"" she smiled at Zion, but he didn't notice it, keeping starring scowlingly at the wasteland. After a while, Una continued, ""I read about how, for fun, our ancestors climbed the highest mountains. I wouldn't risk climbing higher than the roof of our house.""¬†

""Why?"" Zion wondered.

""It's pretty trivial, I'm afraid of heights,"" she said embarrassedly.

""I could say that heights are something we're used to and shouldn't be afraid of...but everyone has their own fears. As the saying goes, if you're afraid of something, be prepared to bump into it, at every turn,"" Zion finally turned to her and smiled. ""We'd better leave. The wind is getting stronger. It's going to be very noisy here soon.""¬†

""Okay,"" she smiled, then hesitated and added, ""Maybe our parents will be home in time for dinner tonight.""

""I don't think that's going to happen.""¬†

""Why?"" she asked, but her eyes showed that Una knew the answer even better than Zion.

""Because, at its best, they are always late,"" his sister didn't make any comment on the answer to her question.¬†



In the past, Una used to get upset if she couldn't see her mother, and even now, it hurts her. Except for this time, she was ready for such a situation.¬†

The only ones who didn't mind their parents' absence were Zion, Forsa, and Madje. Forsa devoted all her time to training and was going to become the head of her older brother's personal guard. She was the best fighter in Basque, following her mother, who led the guards of her father and the cities of Una-Re.

Madje loved training with swords, daggers, and blasters, though he preferred books more. He didn't care much if his parents weren't home and he couldn't see them. Forsa was always there when he needed his mother, so he made no difference whether his parents were home or not. The older Madje got, the more he was fascinated by energy conversion technology and particle boosters. The guy was always trying to anticipate every development and was looking for new solutions. Every day he ran scenarios in simulations.

Zion followed his sister away from the barrier until they reached the lively city streets. Brother and sister walked along the clean roads and well-kept houses with music playing and lights blazing. Bushes with snow-white flowers along the walls and buildings delighted their eyes. Most of the houses were braided with the same coniferous lianas as the ones on the wall. Marra insisted on these plants because they perfectly recycled carbon dioxide into pure oxygen. They took the load off the climatic devices, allowing more energy to be concentrated on the barrier. Moreover, the whole city was transformed into a magical blossoming field when the flowers started blooming on the vines.¬†

Several stores and cafes were still open with parked flyers near them. They were used to move rapidly around the city, levitating and automatically plugging into the nearest distributor to replenish their energy supply. There were different types of vehicles, but most people preferred the two-seater flyers.¬†

Walking along the street, brother and sister crossed the main square, featuring a round plot of land overgrown with blue flowers that bloomed only in the most severe frosts. Therefore, it was surrounded by a dome in a semicircle, invisible to the eye, maintaining the right blooming temperature. The buds glowed, emitting a soft cold light, while a long white bench stretched around the meadow. On the left side, there was a theater and cinema, the center of the whole city. The beautiful white columns glowed with lights of all kinds of colors. Eight hundred meters away, behind the theater on a mountainous rise, there was a large, curved building. Long windows sheltered its front, and the back featured plain floor-to-ceiling frames. The walls were covered with the raw mineral used to make many things on Una-Re, including cloth. The three sails of Basque's main buildings stood the same distance from the theater as the On-Si house. There was a spacecraft court near the blue-and-white building. Currently, one single Swa-Sed, the ship of the On-Si family, stood there.

When brother and sister approached the door of their house, it instantly opened. Inside, the sunlight lamps were burning, illuminating, and warming the rooms. There was a large cream-colored couch in the living room and a beige rug on the floor. Paintings on the walls depicted former landscapes from all over the world. There was a bar opposite the sofa and a fireplace to its left. But there was no fire in it, only its projection, generated by the same primal energy. There were bookshelves along the walls full of priceless folios. Their family treasured them and ensured that every page was preserved since all books were available only on data carriers.¬†

""Here we are,"" Una said sadly.

""Finally, my beloved brother and sister arrived,"" a frowning guy said as he walked down the stairs to the right of the front door. ""Did you bring any food for dinner?""¬†

""Hi, Yak-Haf,"" Una ignored her brother's question, sat down on the sofa, and looked at the fire projection. Her dress changed to a dark coffee color.¬†

""What's wrong, brother? You are frowning like never before,"" Zion made a surprised face. Yak-Haf's behavior was usual enough, and he knew exactly what was going to happen next.

""Everything as usual. Cold, boredom, and now hunger. Well, our parents are late again.""

""Spring is coming, and I'm sure you'll be in a better mood,"" Zion stooged for him. ""As for the food, I'm sure you could have cooked something in all the time you've been home.""¬†

""I wish it were always summer in our city, and I didn't have to cook by myself,""¬† the young man walked over to his sister and sat down next to her, resting his legs on the small glass table. ""What's wrong, sis?""¬†

""Yak-Haf, don't bother me today,"" said Una, turning away from her brother.¬†

""Did you really expect our parents to come home? I'm sure they have better things to do,"" the brother grinned wickedly.¬†



She pushed her brother's hand away as he tried to ruffle her hair. Her eyes were full of irritation.¬†



""You shouldn't talk to me like that, I'm not a little girl anymore.""¬†

""I'm off, you're boring me,"" Yak-Haf sighed heavily, got up from his chair, and headed back to the stairs.

""So much drama, nothing new,"" quietly, almost whispering, commented Zion. Maybe he should have tried to prevent this from happening, but he didn't want to. He simply kept waiting to see what would happen next. Zion was too tired after hours of work.¬†

""My elder brother, sister, good night to you,"" Yak-Haf bowed playfully, fixing his hair and laughing, and went upstairs, trying to stomp as loudly as possible.¬†

""A mature man, but acting like a child,"" Zion couldn't resist, ""and you could have ignored him, you know how he is. I don't want to hear that kind of stuff after a hard day.""¬†

""I'm sure you're not the only one who's had a day like this. But he doesn't offend you, just me‚Ä¶""

""Because you're the only one who takes notice,"" Zion said without letting his sister finish. Una stared at her brother and decided to stop discussing it further. The girl got up and headed for the stairs, rapidly going up and disappearing around the corner.¬†

Zion had nothing to do but sigh. Outside the window, fluffy snowflakes swirled in the air, covering the roofs of all the houses with a white cloth, but Forsa and Madje were still absent. Evidently the younger brother was out late with his team or in the university science lab, and Forsa was busy, as always, with training. The young man ate his dinner alone and went to bed thinking of eternal summer. Even though Yak-Haf wanted it, a regenerating nature needs a stable cycle, which has been artificially maintained in all the cities of Una-Re.¬†¬†

Forsa got home around 11 p.m., left her big bag by the front door, without bothering to put it in its place, and went straight to the kitchen. While checking her messages, she found one from Una. Her sister wrote that the family evening didn't take place. The girl knew why Kion and Marra failed to come, but she couldn't tell the others. That was why Forsa hadn't rushed home tonight. Checking out the mess in the kitchen left by one of her brothers or sister, the girl cleaned it up, and then started cooking.¬†

A few minutes after she made dinner, Madje arrived. The guy just nodded at her and took his plate to sit down next to her. The older sister only raised an eyebrow and silently started to eat. It seemed to her that her brother was staying out late intentionally, so that he could come after her and eat what she had cooked. She had two versions, one, he was too lazy to serve himself, or that he liked the way she cooked. She hoped for the second option. There was nothing unusual about her cooking, but her brother always tried to eat only her food.¬†

""How's it going?"" Madje asked once finished almost half of the meal.¬†

""Fine, and how are you?"" the girl chose not to greet him, since he didn't do so. It was a usual thing for Madje, at first, he was silent, and then he started talking without greeting anyone.¬†

""I can't figure out what the error is. The calculations are correct, but I can't combine the two energy flows, he said slowly and frowned""

""What happens in the simulations?"" the sister asked.¬†

""The directional gauges don't hold up. Causing explosions, explosions, and explosions over again.

""I'm sure you can figure it out,"" Forsa hesitated and continued, ""Maybe you should take a little break. You could attend training, there's a tournament coming up. Even Yak-Haf started to frequent the training hall again. There is talk that the Eastern population representative will send his son this time, who is considered a great fighter in those lands.""¬†

""Well, maybe I'll be there, but I make no promises.""

""Madje, you know that this is one of the most important events on Una-Re. Besides, I am not forcing you to participate.""¬†

""Sounds like nonsense to me.""¬†

""You're wrong. I think we have to show not only our intelligence but also our strength. It's a balance of mind and body,"" the girl spread her arms apart, reminding Madje of the scales. ""Furthermore, the power our parents hold forces us to conform and strive to be the best in everything we do.""¬†

""Well, what does this power give us? We live like everyone else. Except the house is bigger, though I doubt it's only because our family is bigger than the average one.""¬†

""You have nothing to complain about. At least you never get bored.""

""I'm never bored as it is,"" he remarked glumly.¬†

""It doesn't seem so,"" the girl laughed out loud.¬†

""Forsa, thanks for dinner,"" the guy said as he stood up.¬†

""You're welcome,"" Forsa kept smiling, ""I hope to see you tomorrow at the gym. I'm sure it will do you good.""¬†

""I almost forgot, wasn't dinner with our parents supposed to be tonight?"" he asked, walking up the stairs.¬†

""Yes, but they didn't come.""¬†

""I get, good night.""

""Good night to you, too.""¬†

Just as he went up to his room, the bracelet on his arm glowed yellow. Surprised, he sat down at his desk and activated the keyboard. The monitor displayed a three-hour-old message from one of the stations near Edal. The young man was surprised since he couldn't have missed it. The sensor that sent the alert was badly damaged as if something had hit it. Madje checked the report for the past few days. There were no meteorite alerts, and after a few minutes, the damaged sensor ceased responding. Determined to deal with it tomorrow, the guy turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom before bed. For better or worse, he wouldn't go to Forsa's training.

¬†

This is a true mind-bending story of a Minnesota man who piloted a UFO across space- time.

So, I noticed that the Dean of Ufology, Grant Cameron, has been focusing for some time on a rare and peculiar aspect of the UFO experience.

It is abductees, contactees‚Äô and/or sundry experiencers who report that ‚ÄúThe Others‚Äù sometimes encourage or even insist that people try their hand at piloting a UFO. In all cases, this is accomplished by the melding of the mind of the person with the consciousness of the UFO itself.

Cameron explores this phenomenon in-depth in his new book, UFO Sky Pilots. In it, he shares the reports of ten experiencers, folks from all occupations, who have been granted the extraordinary privilege of flying a UFO. As it turns out, the greater implications that fall out of this scenario are far more profound and wide-ranging than you might imagine.

Kvande relates his lifetime of UFO and alien interaction in his book, they are two long-time Minnesota MUFON top investigators, Bill McNeff, and Craig R. Lang. Both McNeff and Lang said they consider Roger Kvande among the most credible UFO experiencers they have interviewed out of hundreds investigated over many years. Prolific and bestselling British author Nick Redfern judged Kvande to be a ‚Äúpar excellence‚Äù example of a UFO phenomenon experiencer.

I have also had some communication with Mr. Kvande as well. I can tell you that he is not fake. In fact, he has enjoyed a decades-long and successful career in the electronics-computer sector. Before he retired, he was the Senior Scientific Programmer at Unisys, IBM in Rochester, MN. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial electronics at Bemidji State University. His skills have been in much demand over the years. He has worked for many of the biggest names in the industry.

Grant Cameron notes in his book that, among all the UFO pilot [experiencers]() he has interviewed, most say they flew the craft only once.

In Kvande‚Äôs case, however, he has ‚Äúflown the ship‚Äù multiple times.

¬†He began piloting a UFO from the time he was a child and into adulthood. Indeed, he developed an intensely personal relationship with a UFO he came to call simply, ‚ÄúShip.‚Äù Kvande describes Ship as an A.I. with its own intelligence. In some respects, Ship is like Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù or Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúSiri,‚Äù except a million times wiser, more knowledgeable, and more powerful. Ship is ever ready to answer Kvande‚Äôs questions and offer advice. For example, as Kvande was flying over the super-flat plains of the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota-Dakota, he casually wondered why the landscape was so flat.

Ship read his mind and instantly flooded his consciousness with a geological history lesson dating back to the last Ice Age. It showed him how various earth forces acted over thousands of years to create the pool table terrain of northeast North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and southern Manitoba. But Kvande also said this downloaded history lesson quickly became overwhelming. The amount of information poured into his mind was voluminous to the point of disorientation.

In Cameron‚Äôs book, most of the UFO pilots report flights into space, to other planets or sometimes to points on planet Earth, but in Kvande‚Äôs case, Ship can take him not only to the far corners of the universe but backward and forward through time. Furthermore, Ship can assist Kvande in interacting with his past lives and future lives as in reincarnation-type scenarios. Ship is a source of predictive information as well, such as showing or warning Kvande of [possible future]() catastrophic events. In one instance, for example, Ship shows Kvande a future day in which a supernova is blazing menacingly in Earth‚Äôs sky.

¬†‚ÄúMY COMMUNICATION WITH MR. KVANDE‚Äù

After I published a book review of Extraterrestrial Odyssey in 2017, Roger Kvande reached out to me to thank me for my positive comments. We then further engaged in a short dialogue after that. He provided me with some additional fascinating information about Ship.

‚ÄúWhen I flew Ship, I was within the body of the beast being fed oxygen, food I was protected,‚Äù Kvande said. Ship was designed to find a newly forming solar system and then help planets develop their environments.

It assists in life cycles that produce planets that hold water and can nurture new life.

¬†‚ÄúWHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF IT?‚Äù

I realize that many who read this, even UFO proponents, will find their belief systems stressed to breaking point by Kvande‚Äôs story. What helps his case, however, is that many witnesses, without a doubt witnessed what was certainly a significant and spectacular UFO event that occurred in Bagley in April of 1966. At the time, the story received some national attention.

For example, the Bagley incident was reported in Flying Saucers, a Chicago-based magazine edited by the once-famous Raymond A. Palmer. A significant and influential figure in the field of science fiction, Palmer was the former long-time editor of the pulp science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories.

Raymond Palmer also was a co-founder of FATE magazine, at one time the largest circulation paranormal-topic magazine of its kind in the world. FATE is still published today. Anyway, Ray Palmer placed this blurb in the March 1967 issue of Flying Saucers magazine (which he also created and edited):

April 22, 1966, Bagley (Minnesota) Several people were said to have observed an object fly at low altitude and land outside Bagley. Four dwarfs [seemed to make]() repairs, then the craft flew away.

(Note: Kvande said that there were four gray aliens with him inside the UFO during his flying adventures).

Still, many of you might be saying: ‚ÄúYou know, Ken, a blurb in a low-circulation UFO mag from the 1960s is not much to hang your hat on.‚Äù

Well, there is a lot more information to suggest that the 1966 Bagley UFO flyover really happened.

This, in addition to the considerable recorded public record notations and the embedded lore of the April 1966 UFO event in Bagley, Minnesota, make this one of the most interesting cases in ufology. I return now to Minnesota MUFON investigators Bill McNeff and Craig Lang. They report a conversation with a certain Art Sampsel of Bunker Hill, Indiana.

Mr. Sampsel said that a friend of his was in the tiny town of Goodridge, Minnesota, attending a farm sale. Goodridge is about fifty miles from Bagley. At the farm sale, Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend reports that he overheard two local farmers from Bagley discussing the April 1966 UFO storming of Main Street.

They described the event as Roger Kvande said it happened, including the fact that the school bus, nearly collided with it before landing ‚Äúon the outskirts of town.‚Äù The two Bagley farmers added that the ‚Äúentire town was in a panic.‚Äù Finally, I can tell you this, as a NW Minnesota resident, have traveled through and stopped for a time on many occasions in the town of Bagley over the years. My brother lives in the nearby city of Bemidji. On one trip, back in the 1990s, I stopped at a convenience store gas station that was also a bait shop and there I overheard a conversation by some local elderly guys spending time together and drinking coffee. They were discussing the very same story as presented by Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend at the Goodridge farm sale, and the details of the bait shop guys were identical.",1,1732886915.0,UFOs_Archives,1,1.0,False

How do I prepare?,"For the past year and a half at my company, I have had to go in 4 days a week, and I‚Äôve had the option to WFH on Fridays. I live 10 minutes from the office, so it is what it is, but these virtual Fridays really mean something to me. It‚Äôs one day of the week where I get to sleep in, make my coffee at home, relax and work in the comfort of my own room. I have therapy at 11AM every Friday as well, so it has been huge for that, as well as for making any medical appointments that I need to.

Additionally, I play in an intramural volleyball league every Thursday night. I specially chose Thursday because of the WFH the next day, knowing that I could play in late games and have a couple of drinks if the team went out after the games without worrying about having to get up at 6:30 the next morning just to get a parking spot at the office (it‚Äôs a building of 3k and the lot fills up by 8AM).

This week, all managers received a message that managers and higher must go in to the office every day beginning next week. They will no longer be able to WFH on Fridays. As of now, I still can, but my manager said that she expects the rest of us will also have to report 5 days a week beginning after the new year, and that these virtual Fridays will be over. My jaw dropped when I heard this news. I really can‚Äôt believe it. This change will not add so much time to my day since I live close to the office, but it still sucks, and I have been upset and anxious about it to the point of having stomach issues. I will now lose that day on Fridays of just being at home, which was so good for my mental health. For my therapy appointment, I will need to book a conference room in the office (which is nearly impossible due to the sheer amount of people there) or go out to my car in the winter weather. 

I also live close by now, but I want to buy a condo where I‚Äôm from, which is about an hour north of the office, in the next couple of years. This will really hurt my opportunities to do that. I‚Äôm also tired of hearing my friends say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs one more day?‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou live right there!‚Äù 

I plan to casually browse and apply to jobs that are hybrid or remote, but I don‚Äôt even know if this is worth it. I do love the team I work with, and everything else besides the soon-to-be 5 days and the low salary is great. And it seems like so many companies are doing a full RTO. So I wouldn‚Äôt want to leave for somewhere that is hybrid at first, because what if they do the same thing? Then I‚Äôd be stuck with the same 5 days a week in office, except with potentially a worse team and a worse commute.

This news is still sinking in, and I am kind of sick over the fact that today might be one of my last Fridays to get to WFH. This edict, assuming it happens for me as well, is coming from the CEO, and there‚Äôs nothing my manager can do to keep the Fridays at home for my team. She is rolling over and complying, and I really can‚Äôt even blame her. I feel for the people who live an hour or more away, who will now have to do that long commute an extra day.

It would have cost the CEO nothing to let his employees keep the one precious WFH day they had. My morale has really gone down, and if my direct boss weren‚Äôt so great i would really be on my way out. Thoughts on this?

1h2lqvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjaslushi/comments/1h2lqvu/i_may_have_solved_the_milk_foaming_problem/,I may have solved the milk foaming problem,"**Problem**: Milky drinks (or anything high in protein) rapidly turn into an undrinkable foam when agitated for an extended period of time, e.g. through the churning action of the Ninja Slushi. The manual suggests solving this by adding a load of cream, which does work initially, but the foam will return after a while and it requires adding a load of saturated fat to the drink, which isn't ideal.

**Solution**: Chemistry provides us with a variety of anti-foaming agents, notably including [polydimethylsiloxane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), which is a silicone oil widely used in food manufacturing. McDonald's uses it in their frying oil to prevent it from foaming up and splashing dangerously during cooking, and in their milkshakes to reduce foam generation; it's also used in various protein powder supplements to prevent them becoming super foamy when shaken.

PDMS is available from various sources, but the two easiest ones I could find are home-brewing suppliers (where it's used to prevent beer over-foaming during brewing) and from pharmacists in the form of a medication used for IBS relief (albeit at much higher doses than I'm using here). I purchased the medication here in the UK - an oral gel composed of 70% PDMS and 30% called *Enterosgel*, which appears to also be available in the US - and tried it out today with some good results.

I added 1.5g of the gel (just over 1g of PDMS) to 250g of cold brew coffee (with 10g each of allulose, erythritol, and glycerine; plus 1.5g of xanthan gum) and blended it thoroughly to incorporate the ingredients, then mixed it with 250g of whole milk and briefly blended the whole mixture together. I then poured the whole mixture into my Slushi machine and set it to the frappe mode, then waited. Instead of foaming up as it normally would, the bubbles remained very small and after \~20 minutes of churning they hadn't climbed much higher than where they started. Begin impatient and wanting my coffee, I poured out the frappe slush into my mug.

So far I've only run the one test, so more experimentation is obviously needed, but my frappe is deliciously thick and smooth, so I'm feeling cautiously optimistic. I'd be very interested to hear if anyone else has tried PDMS or alternative anti-foaming techniques that don't rely on adding loads of extra fat to the mix (not that there's anything wrong with a nice cream-heavy drink, but it's not something I want too often!).",2,1732886798.0,ninjaslushi,0,1.0,False

1h2lpnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1h2lpnk/slavic_woman_perspective_and_ama/,Slavic woman perspective and AMA,"First, cultural notes:

* Unlike the stereotype I don't think most Slavic women have gold digging tendencies. If they do, it's obvious from the start. You cant expect the woman with a done face (fillers, Instagram model type), hair extensions, instagram photos from all over the world, designer bags, etc. to agree to a coffee date. If you want a woman like this expectations are clear from the start and she makes them obvious. 
* But most girls are not like that and they can be very shamed if they are obviously dating someone for the money/gifts. If they are dating a much older men the friends joke about it (""How is your uncle?"")
* Depends on the family the girl comes from expectations can be VERY different. If she comes from a family with a good father figure she will have high expectations (most dads buy their daughters gifts, cars, sometimes even flowers for both the daughter and the mother). Drunk fathers, abusive fathers - I'm not commenting on that, but there are patterns
* Most girls date guys around their age, marry and have children before 30. In comparison to what I saw in Spain, France, men have a lot of more responsibility in relationships and if you have a good relationship you get married in 2-4 years. Slavic men do not waste women's time. Couples who are together for longer than 5 years and dont have kids or arent married are very shamed, especially if they are in their 30s
* Hookup culture isnt as common because if you use dating apps you can be shamed for being desperate, especially if you use dating apps for a long time and havent gotten into a relationship (for both men and women). Most people meet their partners at uni or at their job, in their social circle
* Slavic families value education and fathers usually push the daughters to pursue education and be self-reliant. Girls from families with a present dad can be raised quite strictly. Families are patriarchal. In Spain and Italy I observed that men love a domineering woman and a mother figure and the cultural difference was quite drastic
* Depending on the country you visit, men can be very protective of their women, especially in Serbia, Croatia, Albania. If you harass women you can get beaten up
* Poland, Czech republic, Hungary are visited more often, so if a girl from there entertains a tourist, you are not the first one. Most normal girls would avoid someone who visits because ""the women are beautiful"", guys can also shame the girls who date out or sleep around with tourists. If you want a serious relationship STAY IN THE COUNTRY FOR LONGER
* Speaking the language - I have yet to meet someone my age or younger that doesnt speak English unless they are from a village
* A lot of girls are open to a 50-50 dynamic, our mothers and grandmothers werent just housewives, they both worked and maintained the home. So there can be pressure to do a lot for your family as a woman however the man is still expected to take up the bigger financial responsibilities. Although Ive noticed that many couples buy home together and share the payment (even if they arent married)
* Because of socialism/communism work is still important two generations later. People work hard, you are pressured to work and study at the same time, although in some families parents pay for the education
* Women, unless they are in a serious relationship, tend to live with their parents unless they study or work in another city/country
* Both men and women can be looked down upon if they sleep around

Slavic women's type:

* Russian and Ukrainian women love Arabs and Turkish men, if she has a father figure then it's more complex because the older generation can be very Islamophobic. Still depends on the family and how liberal they are
* There is also a thing for Latino men if she grew up watching telenovelas (they were very common when I was growing up)
* Southern European men are also loved for looks but have a reputation for cheating, being mommy boys, so unless he is an absolute macho, it would be hard to maintain a relationship. They also expect the woman to do a lot without giving nothing in return. They are used to their women running after them and most Slavic women wouldn't chase a man like that
* Higher class Italian men love Slavic women as well as Romanian women
* Older generation tends to dislike the US unless they were very anti-socialism or more artistic families, so if you have serious intentions you have to work hard to impress her family if you are American. If the parents were born after 1970 then they usually don't care 
* Respect matters, be respectable, keep your word, be reliable. Reputation also matters, for both men and women
* Russian women can be stereotypically bolder (esp in older generations) because of how many men were lost because of the wars so they can do a lot to impress a man, compete for a man. HOWEVER I dont think younger Slavic women are the type to chase men as much as Western women do. The man is expected to pursue, make the first move. Even if the man is extremely good looking women have a lot of pride and wouldn't run after him first
* Nordic and English men are liked by younger women however there used to be a lot of xenophobia in these countries against Eastern Europeans, especially in the older generation so there is caution (again, depends on the age) 



Random

Millenial generation - over 28-29 can be more conservative compared to women of the same age in France, Spain. I don't think feminism was a trend for that generation as much as it was in Western Europe. Again, unmarried men and women in their 30s and especially 40s are shamed. Both genders. If you are a man in his 40s that has never been married they assume you are a homosexual or have other major problems, especially older generations. Younger people dont care what others do as much

I mentioned shame a lot of times, culturally people still respect social norms and if you are out of these social norms, you can get badmouthed

The most random source of information I can add is something I learned from an older Russian millenial woman (37), who told me that there were rumours of wealthier Arab men sending people to scout for girls in more rural parts of Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan in the mid-late 2010s. Kind of sounded like something between Passport bro-ing and Human trafficking. Unsure if it's true

I've got something to share that's not your typical crypto pump. I've been talking about $PEIRO to everyone I know - my family, my friends, even the guy at the local coffee shop. I'm not here to shill it on Reddit because, frankly, I want you all to be part of something more substantial than just chasing price candles.  
Here‚Äôs the deal:  


* I've Quit My Job for This: That's how much belief I have in $PEIRO. I'm not saying you should go all in like me, but hear me out.
* Community Driven: This isn't just about buying low and selling high. $PEIRO is about building something with real utility. The team behind it has laid out a roadmap that actually makes sense, focusing on real-world applications.
* The Entry Point: Now, right now, is a golden window. We're at the ground floor. If you've ever wished you got in early on something big, this is your moment.
* Why I'm Shilling IRL: There's a different vibe when you talk crypto face-to-face. You see the light in people's eyes when they grasp the potential. That's what I've been experiencing, and it's magical.
* The Ride: Trust me, this ride will be unlike any other. It's not just about the potential financial gains; it's about being part of a movement. There‚Äôs a sense of camaraderie, a shared vision where we all could win.

I‚Äôm not here to convince you with charts or technical analysis. I‚Äôm here because I believe in the project, and more importantly, in the community that's forming around it.   
So, if you're tired of jumping from one coin to another, waiting for that next big pump, maybe it's time to consider what you're actually investing in. $PEIRO isn't just another coin; it's a step towards something bigger.  
Let's make history together.   
Who‚Äôs with me? Remember, don‚Äôt YOLO your life savings, but if you believe in the vision, let's make this happen.

¬†

This is a true mind-bending story of a Minnesota man who piloted a UFO across space- time.

So, I noticed that the Dean of Ufology, Grant Cameron, has been focusing for some time on a rare and peculiar aspect of the UFO experience.

It is abductees, contactees‚Äô and/or sundry experiencers who report that ‚ÄúThe Others‚Äù sometimes encourage or even insist that people try their hand at piloting a UFO. In all cases, this is accomplished by the melding of the mind of the person with the consciousness of the UFO itself.

Cameron explores this phenomenon in-depth in his new book, UFO Sky Pilots. In it, he shares the reports of ten experiencers, folks from all occupations, who have been granted the extraordinary privilege of flying a UFO. As it turns out, the greater implications that fall out of this scenario are far more profound and wide-ranging than you might imagine.

Kvande relates his lifetime of UFO and alien interaction in his book, they are two long-time Minnesota MUFON top investigators, Bill McNeff, and Craig R. Lang. Both McNeff and Lang said they consider Roger Kvande among the most credible UFO experiencers they have interviewed out of hundreds investigated over many years. Prolific and bestselling British author Nick Redfern judged Kvande to be a ‚Äúpar excellence‚Äù example of a UFO phenomenon experiencer.

I have also had some communication with Mr. Kvande as well. I can tell you that he is not fake. In fact, he has enjoyed a decades-long and successful career in the electronics-computer sector. Before he retired, he was the Senior Scientific Programmer at Unisys, IBM in Rochester, MN. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial electronics at Bemidji State University. His skills have been in much demand over the years. He has worked for many of the biggest names in the industry.

Grant Cameron notes in his book that, among all the UFO pilot [experiencers]() he has interviewed, most say they flew the craft only once.

In Kvande‚Äôs case, however, he has ‚Äúflown the ship‚Äù multiple times.

¬†He began piloting a UFO from the time he was a child and into adulthood. Indeed, he developed an intensely personal relationship with a UFO he came to call simply, ‚ÄúShip.‚Äù Kvande describes Ship as an A.I. with its own intelligence. In some respects, Ship is like Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù or Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúSiri,‚Äù except a million times wiser, more knowledgeable, and more powerful. Ship is ever ready to answer Kvande‚Äôs questions and offer advice. For example, as Kvande was flying over the super-flat plains of the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota-Dakota, he casually wondered why the landscape was so flat.

Ship read his mind and instantly flooded his consciousness with a geological history lesson dating back to the last Ice Age. It showed him how various earth forces acted over thousands of years to create the pool table terrain of northeast North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and southern Manitoba. But Kvande also said this downloaded history lesson quickly became overwhelming. The amount of information poured into his mind was voluminous to the point of disorientation.

In Cameron‚Äôs book, most of the UFO pilots report flights into space, to other planets or sometimes to points on planet Earth, but in Kvande‚Äôs case, Ship can take him not only to the far corners of the universe but backward and forward through time. Furthermore, Ship can assist Kvande in interacting with his past lives and future lives as in reincarnation-type scenarios. Ship is a source of predictive information as well, such as showing or warning Kvande of [possible future]() catastrophic events. In one instance, for example, Ship shows Kvande a future day in which a supernova is blazing menacingly in Earth‚Äôs sky.

¬†‚ÄúMY COMMUNICATION WITH MR. KVANDE‚Äù

After I published a book review of Extraterrestrial Odyssey in 2017, Roger Kvande reached out to me to thank me for my positive comments. We then further engaged in a short dialogue after that. He provided me with some additional fascinating information about Ship.

‚ÄúWhen I flew Ship, I was within the body of the beast being fed oxygen, food I was protected,‚Äù Kvande said. Ship was designed to find a newly forming solar system and then help planets develop their environments.

It assists in life cycles that produce planets that hold water and can nurture new life.

¬†‚ÄúWHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF IT?‚Äù

I realize that many who read this, even UFO proponents, will find their belief systems stressed to breaking point by Kvande‚Äôs story. What helps his case, however, is that many witnesses, without a doubt witnessed what was certainly a significant and spectacular UFO event that occurred in Bagley in April of 1966. At the time, the story received some national attention.

For example, the Bagley incident was reported in Flying Saucers, a Chicago-based magazine edited by the once-famous Raymond A. Palmer. A significant and influential figure in the field of science fiction, Palmer was the former long-time editor of the pulp science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories.

Raymond Palmer also was a co-founder of FATE magazine, at one time the largest circulation paranormal-topic magazine of its kind in the world. FATE is still published today. Anyway, Ray Palmer placed this blurb in the March 1967 issue of Flying Saucers magazine (which he also created and edited):

April 22, 1966, Bagley (Minnesota) Several people were said to have observed an object fly at low altitude and land outside Bagley. Four dwarfs [seemed to make]() repairs, then the craft flew away.

(Note: Kvande said that there were four gray aliens with him inside the UFO during his flying adventures).

Still, many of you might be saying: ‚ÄúYou know, Ken, a blurb in a low-circulation UFO mag from the 1960s is not much to hang your hat on.‚Äù

Well, there is a lot more information to suggest that the 1966 Bagley UFO flyover really happened.

This, in addition to the considerable recorded public record notations and the embedded lore of the April 1966 UFO event in Bagley, Minnesota, make this one of the most interesting cases in ufology. I return now to Minnesota MUFON investigators Bill McNeff and Craig Lang. They report a conversation with a certain Art Sampsel of Bunker Hill, Indiana.

Mr. Sampsel said that a friend of his was in the tiny town of Goodridge, Minnesota, attending a farm sale. Goodridge is about fifty miles from Bagley. At the farm sale, Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend reports that he overheard two local farmers from Bagley discussing the April 1966 UFO storming of Main Street.

They described the event as Roger Kvande said it happened, including the fact that the school bus, nearly collided with it before landing ‚Äúon the outskirts of town.‚Äù The two Bagley farmers added that the ‚Äúentire town was in a panic.‚Äù Finally, I can tell you this, as a NW Minnesota resident, have traveled through and stopped for a time on many occasions in the town of Bagley over the years. My brother lives in the nearby city of Bemidji. On one trip, back in the 1990s, I stopped at a convenience store gas station that was also a bait shop and there I overheard a conversation by some local elderly guys spending time together and drinking coffee. They were discussing the very same story as presented by Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend at the Goodridge farm sale, and the details of the bait shop guys were identical.",1,1732886138.0,UFOs,3,0.57,False

He often sat and watched as people rushed to and from work. He could probably open his little hardware store later but he enjoyed his morning coffee by the front window. The people hurrying along, either on foot or in car, weaving around and avoiding potential chaos with every step. 


He had noticed her more than a year back. She had caught his eye one morning as she ran to make the 8am train, hair streaming out behind her as she does the throng. He was amazed at her chaos, from her riot of curls to the 2 handbags filled to the brim. She continues to cause havoc each morning in some form or fashion, apparently being perpetually late.  


The 2 times she had entered his shop he had tried to talk, wanting to flirt and impress her. He mangled his words until finally mumbling her total and a quiet Thank You. He hated how she had looked at him like one of the alley rats.


Nearly everyday he had watched her, feeling like a stalker, but still needing to see her. He knew he should start drinking his coffee somewhere else but his chest ached each time he saw her.


*****


The morning dawned like any other and he dropped himself down in the old squeaky wooden chair by the window and picked up his coffee. He had convinced himself that 7am was early enough that he was just people-watching, not watching just for her. 


The hot coffee bit his lip as he rushed that first sip. Sitting it down on his desk he scanned up and down the street. Movement across the early street caught his eye. A man in a black leather jacket stepped out of the alley shadows followed by a man in a grey windbreaker. The stepped into the sunlight and leaned against the red brick.


People stopping and watching was nothing new and he didn't think anything about it. He continued drinking his now cooled coffee, his eyes kept drifting back to the men who seemed to be focused on a spot just down the block from him. 


He knew the moment she came out. He didn't know which apartment was hers but he swears he could feel her presence as she left her home.  He noticed something else too, the two men straightened up. Their eyes became focused on the same spot and began tracking toward him. His heart clutched as she passed him and he saw leather jacket and grey windbreaker start off a roos the street toward her. 


He knew I. His soul she was in danger and he had to help her. He sprang from his chair and grabbed a tactical from the display as he rushed for the front door. He tucked the sheath in his front pocket as he grabbed the doorknob and ran down the front steps. 


The two men had gotten blocked crossing the street and he was in the lead. He found her rushing obliviously to her train. He took off at a run, panic in his bones.


He caught up to her in a few yards and grabbed her arm. Startled, she jerked away, turning toward him wide-eyed. She looked at his eyes and then down at his belt, focusing on the knife handle. She immediately swung her bags striking him upside the head and making stars explode in his eyes. 


He dropped to the concrete as she took off like a sprinter. He began to push his spinning head off the ground when the two men showed up in his vision.


‚ÄúShe‚Äôs ours punk,‚Äù leather jacket said in his face. He felt a pierce in his side as the man moved in close as if he was checking on him. The jumped back up quickly and took off after her. 


He felt the blood begin to itch as it ran down his ribs to his sternum. He knew if they got to her they were going to hurt her. He didn't know why they needed her, but he knew he needed her worse. He needed her hair flying past his window every morning. He needed her in this world, his world, even if it was always from a distance.


He pushed himself off the ground, the pain in his side making his vision blur. He cleared his eyes as he got to his feet. Taking as big of a breath as possible he took off after the three of them.


He stumbled down the subway steps but kept his legs under him. He saw the two men approaching the opposite steps with her walking tigfly between them. He ran as much as possible, heart hammering and gasping for air through the pain.


They made it to the top of the stairs as he stepped on the bottom. They couldn't run as it would attract attention, but he could. He ran and stumbled up the stairs keeping her in his sight as much as possible. 


He slowed a step as he realized they were taking her into an alley. Waiting until they had fully made the corner her took off with renewed speed. He made the turn and found both men pressing her against the wall with a knife to her nose. He pulled his knife and hit them both in a flying tackle.


he did his best to stab and slice as long as he had the advantage. He came at the with all the rage and aggression he could muster. Grey Windbreaker swung a right hook and knocked him off the two of them.  


The two men got up and looked at each other, blood streaming out of various cuts and stabs. They turned and looked at him as he rolled to his feet like a predator ready to pounce. Deciding against fighting this lunatic the two men took off farther down the dark alley.


The adrenaline faded quickly and he dropped the knife as he slumped to the dirty concrete, rolling onto his back. Staring up at the thin blue stretch of sky he saw as she leaned over him. He marveled at her deep brown eyes, halod with her riot of brunette curls. As she pulled a cell phone up to her ear, his world faded to black.


*****


He had the thought that thisust be what a fish felt, as his conscious was yanked into the bright sterile room. He blinked at the harsh lights for a moment as his head spun and he debated on rolling over and going back to sleep.


The same brown eyes came back into his vision. The memory of the alley came to him, causing pain to raise his heart rate as a beeping grew incessantly louder. 


‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù He asked.


‚ÄúYes, thanks to you, I'm Jessica by the way.‚Äù She said with a smile.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Assessing a climate engineering proposal requires careful consideration of various factors, including its scientific basis, potential effectiveness, risks, costs, ethics, and governance. Let‚Äôs break this into steps:

# 1. Understanding the Proposal

* **Type of Climate Engineering:** Is it solar radiation management (e.g., stratospheric aerosol injection, cloud brightening) or carbon dioxide removal (e.g., direct air capture, ocean fertilization)?
* **Mechanism:** What is the scientific principle behind it? How will it achieve the intended effects?
* **Scale:** Local, regional, or global?

# 2. Scientific Basis

* **Evidence:** What research supports the feasibility of the method? Are there peer-reviewed studies or real-world tests?
* **Climate Impact Models:** What do simulations or projections indicate about the proposal's effects?

# 3. Effectiveness

* **Potential Impact:** How much warming could it mitigate? Over what time frame?
* **Limits:** Are there diminishing returns or unintended barriers?

# 4. Risks and Side Effects

* **Environmental Risks:** Could it harm ecosystems, biodiversity, or natural cycles?
* **Social Risks:** Are there risks to human populations (e.g., water, food security)?
* **Unintended Consequences:** What are the potential cascading effects?

# 5. Costs

* **Economic Costs:** What are the direct and indirect costs?
* **Resource Requirements:** What materials, energy, or land use does it entail?
* **Long-Term Maintenance:** What ongoing costs and commitments are necessary?

# 6. Ethical Considerations

* **Equity:** Who benefits, and who bears the risks?
* **Moral Hazard:** Could it reduce efforts toward mitigation (e.g., cutting emissions)?
* **Reversibility:** Can the project be undone if it goes wrong?

# 7. Governance

* **Regulation:** What laws or treaties apply?
* **Oversight:** Who controls or oversees the project?
* **Global Coordination:** Does it require international cooperation?

# 8. Stakeholder Involvement

* **Public Opinion:** How do affected communities perceive it?
* **Expert Review:** Are there independent assessments by climatologists, engineers, and ethicists?

# 9. Alternative Solutions

* **Comparison:** How does this compare to other climate solutions in terms of impact, risk, and cost?
* **Synergy:** Can it complement other strategies like renewable energy or conservation?

Would you like help applying this framework to a specific proposal?

# You said:

I want to build wind turbines at the mouth of the Mackenzie river and possibly the Lena river(? Not sure - large arctic outflow) and use those to run pumps that will spray river water high into the air over the arctic ocean. During winter this should turn into snow which should form pack ice that should cover the arctic waters.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Your proposal outlines an ambitious geoengineering strategy aimed at preserving or regenerating Arctic sea ice through enhanced winter snowpack formation. This has intriguing implications but also requires detailed assessment. Let‚Äôs break it down:

# 1. Understanding the Proposal

* **Type:** Geoengineering, specifically using renewable energy (wind turbines) to manipulate regional climate and ice formation.
* **Mechanism:** Use wind energy to pump river water into the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean during winter. The cold air would freeze the sprayed water, forming snow or ice, potentially thickening the sea ice.
* **Target Area:** Arctic Ocean near river outflows like the Mackenzie (Canada) and possibly the Lena (Russia). Both are major freshwater inputs into the Arctic.

# 2. Scientific Basis

* **Physical Feasibility:**
   * Spraying water into cold Arctic air should create snow under the right conditions. However, some of the water may freeze immediately as ice crystals rather than forming snowpack.
   * Energy requirements for pumping and atomizing water must align with wind turbine output.
* **Climate Impact:**
   * Enhanced snowpack could insulate sea ice and reduce heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, potentially slowing ice melt.
   * Thicker ice might reduce albedo loss (reflectivity) and prevent the positive feedback loop of Arctic warming.

# 3. Effectiveness

* **Local Impact:** Targeted regions (mouths of rivers) might see enhanced ice formation, but broader Arctic coverage might require scaling up significantly.
* **Global Impact:** Potentially slows Arctic warming, indirectly affecting global climate systems by stabilizing ocean currents and reducing methane release from permafrost.
* **Timing:** Would likely need several years to observe measurable effects on Arctic ice stability.

# 4. Risks and Side Effects

* **Environmental Risks:**
   * Increased freshwater deposition could alter salinity and stratification in the Arctic Ocean, affecting marine ecosystems and ocean circulation (e.g., the thermohaline conveyor belt).
   * Over-salting or localized brine formation from freezing freshwater could harm nearby ecosystems.
* **Unintended Consequences:**
   * Changes in snowpack could influence regional weather patterns or disrupt ecosystems relying on existing ice cycles.
   * Wind turbines themselves could pose hazards to Arctic wildlife and affect migratory birds.

# 5. Costs

* **Wind Turbine Installation:** Costs depend on turbine type, Arctic conditions (cold-resistant designs, remote transport), and infrastructure support.
* **Operational Costs:** Maintenance in extreme weather, pump reliability, and labor costs for remote operations.
* **Scaling:** Building enough turbines to create a significant impact across the Arctic might be prohibitively expensive.

# 6. Ethical Considerations

* **Equity:** Benefits would primarily be global (climate stabilization), but risks and disruptions could disproportionately affect Arctic indigenous communities and ecosystems.
* **Moral Hazard:** The project might distract from critical emissions reductions, creating a false sense of security.
* **Reversibility:** It would be difficult to mitigate damage if unintended consequences occur.

# 7. Governance

* **International Collaboration:** As the Arctic is governed by multiple nations and international treaties, cooperation from stakeholders like Canada, Russia, and indigenous peoples is crucial.
* **Regulatory Frameworks:** Currently, no global framework comprehensively regulates geoengineering, but local environmental laws would apply.

# 8. Stakeholder Involvement

* Indigenous communities and Arctic nations must have a voice in the project, as it directly affects their environment and livelihoods.
* Scientific consensus from climatologists, oceanographers, and ecologists is essential to validate the approach.

# 9. Alternative or Complementary Approaches

* **Restoring Albedo:** White reflective materials or synthetic ice packs could be tested in conjunction with this approach.
* **Reducing Arctic Warming:** Focus on black carbon (soot) reduction, which accelerates ice melt by reducing surface reflectivity.
* **Permafrost Stabilization:** Use wind or solar power for complementary projects like freezing methane seeps or maintaining permafrost.

Would you like to explore the feasibility in more detail (e.g., power requirements for pumps, turbine efficiency, or environmental modeling), or consider next steps for proposing and testing this idea?

Setting a budget of 2 Billion dollars to pump 900 liters per minute, and another 3 billion for at least two nuclear powered icebreaking tugboats to move the formed ice packs into transporting currents, what amount of added ice coverage might be possible, if the pumped jet releases from a height of 500m and normal wind conditions spread the snow plume ar least five kilometers.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To estimate the potential ice coverage created by your proposal, we need to calculate the volume of water converted to snow and then assess how that snow translates to ice pack thickness and area. Here‚Äôs how we can approach this:

# 1. Parameters and Assumptions

* **Water Pumped:** 900 liters/minute (0.9 m¬≥/min). Over a year (assuming 24/7 operation), this amounts to approximately 473,040 m¬≥.
* **Snow Conversion Efficiency:** Assume 80% of the pumped water forms snow (some loss due to evaporation or ice crystal dispersion).
* **Snow-to-Ice Conversion:** Snow compresses to form ice. Fresh snow has a density of \~100 kg/m¬≥, while glacial ice has \~900 kg/m¬≥. Conversion factor is approximately 1:9, meaning 1 m¬≥ of snow compresses to 0.11 m¬≥ of ice.
* **Ice Thickness:** Target ice thickness of \~0.5 meters (sufficient to reinforce pack ice).
* **Snow Spread Area:** The snow plume spreads 5 km wide, with normal Arctic wind patterns dispersing it uniformly.

# 2. Step-by-Step Calculations

**A. Annual Water Pumped:**

* 900 liters/min = 0.9 m¬≥/min = 54 m¬≥/hour = 1,296 m¬≥/day.
* Annual total: 1,296‚Äâm3/day√ó365=473,040‚Äâm31,296 \\, \\text{m}\^3/\\text{day} \\times 365 = 473,040 \\, \\text{m}\^31,296m3/day√ó365=473,040m3.

# 3. Scaling Up with a $2 Billion Budget

To improve scalability, let‚Äôs estimate the number of pumps and the total impact:

* **Pumps Installed:** Estimate cost per pump system (including installation, power supply, and operational costs) at $1 million each. With $2 billion, you could deploy approximately 2,000 pumps.
* **Total Ice Produced:** Multiply the coverage of a single pump by 2,000: 0.083‚Äâkm2√ó2,000=166‚Äâkm20.083 \\, \\text{km}\^2 \\times 2,000 = 166 \\, \\text{km}\^20.083km2√ó2,000=166km2.

# 4. Impact of Icebreaking Tugboats

The nuclear-powered icebreaking tugboats can help consolidate the formed ice and move it into ocean currents that transport it to strategic regions. Assuming a tug can consolidate and redirect ice over an area of \~10 km¬≤ per week:

* Two tugboats operating year-round could potentially move ice over 10‚Äâkm2√ó52√ó2=1,040‚Äâkm210 \\, \\text{km}\^2 \\times 52 \\times 2 = 1,040 \\, \\text{km}\^210km2√ó52√ó2=1,040km2 annually.

This combined effort could result in over 1,200 km¬≤ of new or relocated ice coverage annually, potentially slowing Arctic warming.

# 5. Considerations for Wind and Dispersion

* **Snow Dispersion Efficiency:** A 5 km plume implies significant coverage, but wind speeds and patterns might dilute snow deposition. Real-world dispersion models (e.g., Gaussian plume models) would refine estimates.
* **Evaporation and Sublimation:** Arctic winds might also carry some water vapor away before it crystallizes, especially in extreme cold.

I would also like a quick assesment of the heat flow through the climate caused by the heat of fusion of that much ice warming the arctic.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To assess the heat flow caused by the **heat of fusion** (the energy released when water freezes to form ice), we can calculate the total amount of energy transferred to the environment during the freezing process. This energy release would warm the Arctic air and surrounding environment.

# 1. Heat of Fusion of Water

* Heat of fusion for water: **334 kJ/kg**
* Density of water: **1,000 kg/m¬≥**

From the earlier calculations, the annual volume of water frozen into ice is **41,628 m¬≥**, or:

41,628‚Äâm3√ó1,000‚Äâkg/m3=41,628,000‚Äâkg.41,628 \\, \\text{m}\^3 \\times 1,000 \\, \\text{kg/m}\^3 = 41,628,000 \\, \\text{kg}.41,628m3√ó1,000kg/m3=41,628,000kg.

# 2. Total Energy Released

Energy released during freezing is:

Energy=Mass¬†of¬†Ice√óHeat¬†of¬†Fusion\\text{Energy} = \\text{Mass of Ice} \\times \\text{Heat of Fusion}Energy=Mass¬†of¬†Ice√óHeat¬†of¬†Fusion Energy=41,628,000‚Äâkg√ó334‚ÄâkJ/kg=13,911,752,000‚ÄâkJ.\\text{Energy} = 41,628,000 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 334 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} = 13,911,752,000 \\, \\text{kJ}.Energy=41,628,000kg√ó334kJ/kg=13,911,752,000kJ.

Convert to terajoules (TJ):

# 3. Heat Contribution to the Arctic

Now, let‚Äôs consider the effect of this energy on the local Arctic atmosphere and water:

# A. Warming the Air

* Specific heat capacity of air: **1.005 kJ/kg¬∑K**
* Air density at -30¬∞C: **\~1.3 kg/m¬≥**
* Volume of air affected: Assume a **5 km x 5 km x 500 m** snow plume (from earlier assumptions), or:5,000‚Äâm√ó5,000‚Äâm√ó500‚Äâm=12,500,000‚Äâm3.5,000 \\, \\text{m} \\times 5,000 \\, \\text{m} \\times 500 \\, \\text{m} = 12,500,000 \\, \\text{m}\^3.5,000m√ó5,000m√ó500m=12,500,000m3.Mass of air:12,500,000‚Äâm3√ó1.3‚Äâkg/m3=16,250,000‚Äâkg.12,500,000 \\, \\text{m}\^3 \\times 1.3 \\, \\text{kg/m}\^3 = 16,250,000 \\, \\text{kg}.12,500,000m3√ó1.3kg/m3=16,250,000kg.

Temperature increase (ŒîT\\Delta TŒîT) from released heat:

ŒîT=Energy¬†ReleasedMass¬†of¬†Air√óSpecific¬†Heat¬†Capacity\\Delta T = \\frac{\\text{Energy Released}}{\\text{Mass of Air} \\times \\text{Specific Heat Capacity}}ŒîT=Mass¬†of¬†Air√óSpecific¬†Heat¬†CapacityEnergy¬†Released‚Äã

Thus, the freezing process could warm the local Arctic air by **\~0.85¬∞C**, assuming complete energy transfer to the air.

# B. Warming the Water

Some of the energy might warm the surrounding Arctic Ocean instead of the air. Assuming the same energy is transferred to a water layer (specific heat of water: **4.18 kJ/kg¬∑K**):

* Mass of water affected: Assume it spreads over a **5 km x 5 km x 1 m** area of the ocean:5,000‚Äâm√ó5,000‚Äâm√ó1‚Äâm=25,000,000‚Äâm3.5,000 \\, \\text{m} \\times 5,000 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1 \\, \\text{m} = 25,000,000 \\, \\text{m}\^3.5,000m√ó5,000m√ó1m=25,000,000m3.Mass of water:25,000,000‚Äâm3√ó1,000‚Äâkg/m3=25,000,000,000‚Äâkg.25,000,000 \\, \\text{m}\^3 \\times 1,000 \\, \\text{kg/m}\^3 = 25,000,000,000 \\, \\text{kg}.25,000,000m3√ó1,000kg/m3=25,000,000,000kg.

Temperature increase (ŒîT\\Delta TŒîT):

ŒîT=13,911,752,000‚ÄâkJ25,000,000,000‚Äâkg√ó4.18‚ÄâkJ/kg\\cdotpK‚âà0.13‚ÄâK.\\Delta T = \\frac{13,911,752,000 \\, \\text{kJ}}{25,000,000,000 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 4.18 \\, \\text{kJ/kg¬∑K}} \\approx 0.13 \\, \\text{K}.ŒîT=25,000,000,000kg√ó4.18kJ/kg\\cdotpK13,911,752,000kJ‚Äã‚âà0.13K.

Thus, the freezing process could warm the local ocean layer by **\~0.13¬∞C**, assuming complete energy transfer to the water.

# 4. Summary

* **Atmospheric Warming:** \~0.85¬∞C over a 5 km x 5 km plume zone.
* **Ocean Warming:** \~0.13¬∞C for a 1-meter-thick layer over a 5 km x 5 km area.

These effects are localized and would diminish with dispersion, but the added heat would contribute to Arctic heat exchange dynamics, potentially influencing regional weather patterns and delaying the onset of extreme cold. Would you like to explore further dynamics or global implications?

If the project is deemed not viable with wind turbine energy due to reliability concerns in the harsh environment, would nuclear power for the pumps change the impacts. Note that coolung the reactor by warming the pumped water may have advantages.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Switching to **nuclear power** to drive the pumps introduces new dynamics and potential advantages, especially in the Arctic's extreme conditions. Let‚Äôs explore how this affects feasibility, energy impacts, and overall project viability:

# 1. Feasibility of Nuclear Power in the Arctic

* **Reliability:**
   * Small modular reactors (SMRs) or ship-based reactors (like those used in nuclear icebreakers) are well-suited for remote Arctic environments. They provide consistent power, unlike wind turbines, which may struggle in fluctuating wind and icing conditions.
   * Nuclear plants can operate continuously, ensuring year-round pumping without weather interruptions.
* **Longevity:** Modern SMRs are designed for minimal maintenance and long-term operation, making them viable for a multi-decade project.
* **Cooling Advantage:**
   * The reactor requires cooling, which could be integrated into the pumping process by using the same water being sprayed into the atmosphere.
   * This dual-purpose design improves efficiency and reduces heat rejection directly into the surrounding environment.

# 2. Energy Impacts of Nuclear Power

**A. Increased Pumping Capacity**  
Nuclear power provides far more energy than wind turbines, potentially enabling more water to be pumped:

* Assume a 20 MW reactor powers pumps directly:
   * Energy available per year: 20‚ÄâMW√ó24‚Äâhours/day√ó365‚Äâdays=175,200,000‚ÄâkWh/year20 \\, \\text{MW} \\times 24 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 365 \\, \\text{days} = 175,200,000 \\, \\text{kWh/year}20MW√ó24hours/day√ó365days=175,200,000kWh/year.
   * Energy required to pump water (conservatively \~0.5 kWh/m¬≥): 175,200,000‚ÄâkWh/year√∑0.5‚ÄâkWh/m¬≥=350,400,000‚Äâm¬≥/year175,200,000 \\, \\text{kWh/year} \\div 0.5 \\, \\text{kWh/m¬≥} = 350,400,000 \\, \\text{m¬≥/year}175,200,000kWh/year√∑0.5kWh/m¬≥=350,400,000m¬≥/year.

Compared to wind turbines' annual capacity (\~473,040 m¬≥), nuclear power could pump water at **700 times the volume**.

**B. Increased Ice Coverage**  
Using the previous method to calculate snow-to-ice conversion:

* Annual volume of ice formed: 350,400,000‚Äâm¬≥√ó0.8‚Äâ(snow¬†efficiency)√ó0.11‚Äâ(snow-to-ice¬†factor)=30,835,200‚Äâm¬≥350,400,000 \\, \\text{m¬≥} \\times 0.8 \\, (\\text{snow efficiency}) \\times 0.11 \\, (\\text{snow-to-ice factor}) = 30,835,200 \\, \\text{m¬≥}350,400,000m¬≥√ó0.8(snow¬†efficiency)√ó0.11(snow-to-ice¬†factor)=30,835,200m¬≥.
* Ice area (at 0.5 m thickness): 30,835,200‚Äâm¬≥√∑0.5‚Äâm=61,670,400‚Äâm2=61.67‚Äâkm230,835,200 \\, \\text{m¬≥} \\div 0.5 \\, \\text{m} = 61,670,400 \\, \\text{m}\^2 = 61.67 \\, \\text{km}\^230,835,200m¬≥√∑0.5m=61,670,400m2=61.67km2.

This is **750 times more ice coverage** than with wind turbines.

# 3. Heat Flow Impacts

The cooling process of the nuclear reactor introduces additional heat into the pumped water before it is sprayed. This alters the thermal dynamics:

* **Added Heat Before Freezing:** Nuclear reactors operate with efficiencies of \~30-40%, meaning \~60-70% of their thermal energy becomes waste heat. A 20 MW reactor produces **\~40-50 MW of heat**. If this heat warms the pumped water:
   * Total energy added annually: 50‚ÄâMW√ó365‚Äâdays√ó24‚Äâhours=1,576,800,000‚ÄâkWh=5,676‚ÄâTJ50 \\, \\text{MW} \\times 365 \\, \\text{days} \\times 24 \\, \\text{hours} = 1,576,800,000 \\, \\text{kWh} = 5,676 \\, \\text{TJ}50MW√ó365days√ó24hours=1,576,800,000kWh=5,676TJ.
   * Heat added per m¬≥ of pumped water: 5,676‚ÄâTJ√∑350,400,000‚Äâm¬≥=16.2‚ÄâkJ/m¬≥5,676 \\, \\text{TJ} \\div 350,400,000 \\, \\text{m¬≥} = 16.2 \\, \\text{kJ/m¬≥}5,676TJ√∑350,400,000m¬≥=16.2kJ/m¬≥.
* **Heat of Fusion:** Compare this to the heat removed during freezing (\~334 kJ/kg or 334,000 kJ/m¬≥). The added reactor heat is relatively negligible (\~0.005% of the freezing energy).
* **Atmospheric Impacts:** The heat released from freezing the much larger volume of water still warms the Arctic. Using our earlier calculations:
   * Heat released from freezing 350,400,000‚Äâm¬≥350,400,000 \\, \\text{m¬≥}350,400,000m¬≥: 350,400,000‚Äâm¬≥√ó334,000‚ÄâkJ/m¬≥=117,633,600,000,000‚ÄâkJ=117,633‚ÄâTJ350,400,000 \\, \\text{m¬≥} \\times 334,000 \\, \\text{kJ/m¬≥} = 117,633,600,000,000 \\, \\text{kJ} = 117,633 \\, \\text{TJ}350,400,000m¬≥√ó334,000kJ/m¬≥=117,633,600,000,000kJ=117,633TJ.
   * This is **\~20x the thermal output of the reactor** and represents the dominant warming factor.

# 4. Advantages of Nuclear Power

* **Scalability:** Nuclear power allows for significantly increased water pumping and ice coverage.
* **Reliability:** Operates continuously in harsh Arctic conditions.
* **Integration:** Using reactor waste heat to warm the pumped water improves operational efficiency.
* **Durability:** SMRs are designed to withstand extreme environments and can be deployed on stationary platforms or ships.

# 5. Challenges and Risks

* **Environmental Risks:**
   * Accidents or leaks in nuclear systems could devastate fragile Arctic ecosystems.
   * Heat added to the environment, while minor relative to freezing, could disrupt local thermodynamics.
* **Costs:** Initial installation and long-term maintenance of nuclear infrastructure are significantly higher than wind turbines.
* **Governance:** Deploying nuclear power in international waters or near territorial boundaries could face political opposition and treaty restrictions.
* **Waste Management:** Long-term storage and disposal of nuclear waste remain challenges.

# 6. Summary

Switching to nuclear power greatly increases the project's feasibility and impact:

* **Ice Coverage:** Could increase from 0.166 km¬≤/year (wind) to 61.67 km¬≤/year.
* **Energy Reliability:** SMRs offer consistent energy, overcoming wind variability.
* **Environmental Integration:** Reactor cooling can be directly tied to pumping operations.

However, nuclear power introduces higher costs, governance challenges, and potential environmental risks. Would you like to dive deeper into cost comparisons, technical design, or mitigation strategies for nuclear deployment?

   * **Canada:** Hudson Bay and Labrador coast.
   * **Alaska:** Western Arctic.
   * **Norway:** Northern Arctic coast.
   * **Russia:** Two additional systems.
   * **Optional:** Iceland and Greenland.

# 2. Total Ice Formation Capacity

Each nuclear-powered system was estimated to create **\~61.67 km¬≤ of ice coverage per year**, with 0.5 m thickness. For 8 systems:

61.67‚Äâkm2√ó8=493.36‚Äâkm2‚Äâof¬†ice/year.61.67 \\, \\text{km}\^2 \\times 8 = 493.36 \\, \\text{km}\^2 \\, \\text{of ice/year}.61.67km2√ó8=493.36km2of¬†ice/year.

Over 10 years, this scales to \~5,000‚Äì6,000 km¬≤ of new ice, assuming consistent operation.

# 3. Climate Cooling Mechanisms

Ice and snow impact global warming through **albedo effects** and **thermal insulation**:

# A. Albedo Effects

The Arctic's ice and snow reflect solar radiation back into space, reducing heat absorption.

* **Albedo of ice:** \~0.5‚Äì0.7 (reflects 50‚Äì70% of sunlight).
* **Albedo of ocean water:** \~0.06 (reflects \~6%). By replacing darker water with reflective ice, each km¬≤ of ice prevents substantial solar heating.

# Energy saved per km¬≤ of ice:

* Arctic solar energy flux (annual average): \~150 W/m¬≤.
* Energy reflected by ice compared to open water:Difference=(0.7‚àí0.06)√ó150‚ÄâW/m¬≤=94.5‚ÄâW/m¬≤.\\text{Difference} = (0.7 - 0.06) \\times 150 \\, \\text{W/m¬≤} = 94.5 \\, \\text{W/m¬≤}.Difference=(0.7‚àí0.06)√ó150W/m¬≤=94.5W/m¬≤.

# B. Thermal Insulation Effects

Thicker ice insulates the Arctic Ocean, reducing heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere during winter. While the thermal insulation effects are harder to quantify, they reduce ocean heat release into the atmosphere, slowing Arctic warming feedback loops.

# C. Cumulative Effects

Ice coverage can trigger **positive feedback loops**, increasing albedo and cooling effects over time as larger ice sheets persist and grow. These secondary effects magnify the project's impact beyond the directly created ice.

# 4. Global Warming Reduction

The net cooling potential depends on:

1. **Total Energy Saved:**
   * From albedo alone, the systems could prevent \~18,400 TJ of warming over 10 years, equivalent to offsetting **\~0.55 gigatonnes of CO‚ÇÇ emissions** (based on 33.4 TJ per megatonne of CO‚ÇÇ warming potential).
2. **Impact on Arctic Amplification:**
   * Arctic amplification drives global warming faster in polar regions due to melting ice. By maintaining ice cover, these systems may reduce feedback-driven warming, slowing the global temperature rise. Models suggest Arctic stabilization could lower global warming by \~0.1‚Äì0.2¬∞C over decades.
3. **Potential Scaling Impacts:**
   * The systems cover small areas relative to the Arctic Ocean (\~14 million km¬≤), so broader cooling requires scale or secondary effects like new ice formation around the seeded areas.

# 5. Challenges

While promising, the plan faces hurdles:

* **Scale:** Even 8‚Äì10 systems affect only \~616 km¬≤/year, a fraction of the Arctic.
* **Costs:** Initial investments (\~$50 billion for 10 systems) may grow due to unforeseen challenges in logistics and international coordination.
* **Governance:** Arctic nations must collaborate, with potential geopolitical tensions over resource use and sovereignty.

# 6. Summary

If implemented at scale, these systems could:

* Offset **\~0.55 gigatonnes of CO‚ÇÇ emissions** equivalent over 10 years.
* Contribute to a **\~0.1‚Äì0.2¬∞C reduction in global warming** over several decades, assuming positive feedback loops and additional ice formation.

# You said:

What is the estimated economic costs of 0.1¬∞C increase in global warming?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The economic costs of a **0.1¬∞C increase in global warming** depend on various factors, including regional vulnerabilities, economic structures, and the specific impacts of climate change. However, studies on the **social cost of carbon (SCC)** and climate damages provide useful approximations. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

# 1. Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)

The SCC estimates the economic damages caused by emitting one additional tonne of CO‚ÇÇ into the atmosphere. Current estimates vary widely but are often in the range of **$50‚Äì$200/tonne** of CO‚ÇÇ depending on the discount rate and assumptions about climate sensitivity.

* Global warming increases are roughly proportional to cumulative CO‚ÇÇ emissions:
   * A **0.1¬∞C increase** corresponds to approximately **300 billion tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ equivalent (GtCO‚ÇÇe)** added to the atmosphere (based on a rule of thumb: 1¬∞C ‚âà 3,000 GtCO‚ÇÇe).
   * Using an average SCC of $100/tonne: Cost¬†of¬†0.1¬∞C¬†increase=300‚ÄâGtCO‚ÇÇe√ó100‚Äâ$/tCO‚ÇÇe=$30¬†trillion.\\text{Cost of 0.1¬∞C increase} = 300 \\, \\text{GtCO‚ÇÇe} \\times 100 \\, \\text{\\$/tCO‚ÇÇe} = \\text{\\$30 trillion}.Cost¬†of¬†0.1¬∞C¬†increase=300GtCO‚ÇÇe√ó100$/tCO‚ÇÇe=$30¬†trillion.

# 2. Sector-Specific Impacts

A **0.1¬∞C temperature rise** contributes to climate impacts across sectors, compounding damages. Examples include:

# A. Agriculture

* Crop yields decline due to heat stress and changing precipitation patterns.
* Estimates suggest global agricultural GDP losses of **$1‚Äì$3 billion per 0.1¬∞C**, especially in vulnerable regions like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

# B. Sea-Level Rise

* A 0.1¬∞C increase accelerates melting ice and thermal expansion, contributing to sea-level rise:
   * Damage to coastal infrastructure, increased flooding, and displacement costs.
   * Global damages could reach **$2‚Äì$5 billion per 0.1¬∞C** increase, concentrated in coastal cities.

# C. Health

* Rising temperatures exacerbate heatwaves, vector-borne diseases, and air pollution-related illnesses:
   * Estimated health costs are **$1‚Äì$2 billion per 0.1¬∞C**, including healthcare expenses and productivity losses.

# D. Ecosystem Services

* Loss of biodiversity, fisheries, and natural carbon sinks (e.g., forests, wetlands) translates to **$2‚Äì$4 billion** per 0.1¬∞C increase.

# 3. Integrated Economic Models

Global macroeconomic models suggest that each additional 0.1¬∞C of warming causes GDP losses due to productivity declines, infrastructure damage, and resource scarcity:

* **Estimates of GDP Losses:**
   * The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that each 1¬∞C of warming reduces global GDP by **\~1.5%‚Äì2%** on average.
   * For a global GDP of \~$100 trillion, a 0.1¬∞C rise corresponds to: 0.1‚Äâ¬∞C√ó1.5%‚ÄâGDP¬†loss=0.15%‚ÄâGDP¬†loss=$150¬†billion/year.0.1 \\, \\text{¬∞C} \\times 1.5\\% \\, \\text{GDP loss} = 0.15\\% \\, \\text{GDP loss} = \\text{\\$150 billion/year}.0.1¬∞C√ó1.5%GDP¬†loss=0.15%GDP¬†loss=$150¬†billion/year.
* Over a 30-year horizon, this totals **$4.5 trillion in cumulative losses**, assuming steady GDP growth.

# 4. Regional Variations

The costs of 0.1¬∞C warming vary significantly by region:

* **High-vulnerability areas (e.g., small island nations, Africa):** Experience disproportionate damages from sea-level rise, droughts, and extreme weather.
* **Developed countries:** Face higher costs for infrastructure adaptation and disaster recovery but have more resources to mitigate impacts.

# 5. Summary of Economic Costs

The **economic costs of a 0.1¬∞C increase** are significant:

* **$30 trillion** in cumulative SCC damages.
* **$150 billion/year** in global GDP losses (or $4.5 trillion over 30 years).
* **Sector-specific costs:** Agriculture, health, infrastructure, and ecosystems add \~$5‚Äì$15 billion/year.

Investments in Arctic cooling systems (e.g., \~$50 billion for 10 systems) could be cost-effective in mitigating these damages if they successfully reduce warming and avoid catastrophic tipping points. Would you like a comparison of this project‚Äôs costs to other geoengineering strategies?

Does this ice formation plan pass a simplified cost benefits analysis of viability?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

A **simplified cost-benefit analysis** for the Arctic ice formation project can provide insights into its potential economic viability. Here‚Äôs the evaluation based on available data:

# 1. Costs of the Plan

# A. Initial Capital Costs

For **10 systems** (8 proposed and 2 optional in Iceland/Greenland):

* **Ice pumps:** $2 billion per system √ó 10 = **$20 billion**.
* **Icebreaking tugboats:** $3 billion per system √ó 10 = **$30 billion**.
* **Total capital costs:** **$50 billion**.

# B. Operational Costs

Assume nuclear-powered systems have high efficiency but require maintenance and fuel:

* **Annual operating costs:** Estimated at **$500 million per system**.
* For 10 systems over 30 years: 500‚Äâmillion√ó10√ó30=15‚Äâbillion.500 \\, \\text{million} \\times 10 \\times 30 = 15 \\, \\text{billion}.500million√ó10√ó30=15billion.

# Total Costs Over 30 Years:

50‚Äâbillion¬†(capital)+15‚Äâbillion¬†(operational)=65‚Äâbillion.50 \\, \\text{billion (capital)} + 15 \\, \\text{billion (operational)} = 65 \\, \\text{billion}.50billion¬†(capital)+15billion¬†(operational)=65billion.

# 2. Benefits of the Plan

# A. Climate Damage Avoidance

The plan aims to **reduce global warming by \~0.1¬∞C**, potentially avoiding significant economic losses:

* **Social Cost of Carbon (SCC):** Avoided warming (\~300 GtCO‚ÇÇe equivalent) saves an estimated **$30 trillion** in cumulative climate damages.
* **GDP Impacts:** Annual GDP losses avoided (\~$150 billion/year for 0.1¬∞C reduction): 150‚Äâbillion√ó30‚Äâyears=4.5‚Äâtrillion.150 \\, \\text{billion} \\times 30 \\, \\text{years} = 4.5 \\, \\text{trillion}.150billion√ó30years=4.5trillion.
* **Sector-Specific Benefits:** Mitigation of damages to agriculture, infrastructure, health, and ecosystems adds another **\~$500 billion to $1 trillion**.

# Total Economic Benefits:

30‚Äâtrillion¬†(SCC)+4.5‚Äâtrillion¬†(GDP)+1‚Äâtrillion¬†(sectors)‚âà35.5‚Äâtrillion.30 \\, \\text{trillion (SCC)} + 4.5 \\, \\text{trillion (GDP)} + 1 \\, \\text{trillion (sectors)} \\approx 35.5 \\, \\text{trillion}.30trillion¬†(SCC)+4.5trillion¬†(GDP)+1trillion¬†(sectors)‚âà35.5trillion.

# 3. Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)

The **benefit-cost ratio** (BCR) compares the economic benefits to the costs:

BCR=Total¬†BenefitsTotal¬†Costs=35.5‚Äâtrillion65‚Äâbillion‚âà546.\\text{BCR} = \\frac{\\text{Total Benefits}}{\\text{Total Costs}} = \\frac{35.5 \\, \\text{trillion}}{65 \\, \\text{billion}} \\approx 546.BCR=Total¬†CostsTotal¬†Benefits‚Äã=65billion35.5trillion‚Äã‚âà546.

A BCR of **546** suggests that the project is **highly cost-effective**, assuming the projected 0.1¬∞C reduction and associated benefits are achievable.

# 4. Considerations

While the BCR is overwhelmingly favorable, some factors could affect the viability:

1. **Uncertainty in Warming Reduction:** The 0.1¬∞C reduction assumes secondary ice formation and positive feedback loops. If these effects are smaller, the benefits decrease.
2. **Technological Risks:** Operating pumps and icebreakers in extreme Arctic conditions could face reliability issues, increasing costs.
3. **Political and Environmental Risks:** Geoengineering projects often face opposition due to ecological uncertainties, governance challenges, and equity concerns.

# 5. Conclusion

The plan appears **viable** under a simplified cost-benefit analysis if:

* The ice systems effectively reduce warming by 0.1¬∞C.
* Secondary effects (albedo feedback and insulation) amplify benefits.
* Long-term international cooperation ensures the project‚Äôs operation and funding.

I intend to post this conversation publicly. Is there anything you care to add?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Posting this conversation publicly can stimulate valuable dialogue on climate engineering and its role in addressing global warming. Here are some final points to consider for context and clarity:

# 1. Limitations of Geoengineering

* Geoengineering projects, including this ice formation plan, are not substitutes for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They are tools for mitigation and adaptation but must be part of a broader climate strategy.
* Potential unintended consequences, such as impacts on ecosystems, weather patterns, or ocean circulation, must be rigorously studied and monitored.

# 2. Need for Collaboration

* A project of this scale requires international cooperation, especially among Arctic nations, due to shared regional impacts and global implications.
* Governance frameworks for geoengineering are still underdeveloped and require urgent attention to ensure equitable, transparent decision-making.

# 3. Public Perception

* Geoengineering proposals can be controversial. Public engagement and education are critical to build understanding and address legitimate concerns about risks and benefits.

# 4. Exploration of Alternatives

* While this conversation focused on one approach, other climate interventions, like carbon dioxide removal (CDR), reforestation, or ocean fertilization, could complement or compete with this plan. Comparing their costs, benefits, and risks could offer a broader perspective.

# 5. Encouragement for Peer Review

* Posting this publicly can invite experts from various fields‚Äîclimate science, engineering, economics, and ethics‚Äîto critique and refine the proposal. Constructive feedback is essential for improving the viability and safety of any large-scale intervention.

If you're comfortable with this being shared, I encourage emphasizing the speculative and exploratory nature of this analysis. It‚Äôs a thought experiment designed to provoke critical thinking about innovative solutions, not a fully realized policy recommendation. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to adjust or clarify further!

Here‚Äôs a hopeful perspective:

**A Vision for a Cooler, Smarter World**

The Arctic ice formation project represents more than a solution to climate change‚Äîit‚Äôs a testament to human ingenuity, determination, and the power of collaboration. By harnessing cutting-edge technology and renewable energy, we could transform a warming crisis into an opportunity to restore balance to the planet.

Imagine a world where the same nuclear-powered systems cooling the Arctic also cool the massive supercomputing data centers that drive global innovation. These centers‚Äîpowered by clean, abundant energy‚Äîwould help us unlock new scientific discoveries, develop better solutions to global challenges, and connect humanity in ways we've only dreamed of.

By thinking boldly and acting together, we can turn the tide on climate change while building a smarter, more sustainable future. Every drop of water pumped, every byte processed, and every degree of warming mitigated is a step toward a resilient planet that thrives not just for us, but for generations to come.

This project underscores that while challenges are immense, our capacity to dream big and act decisively is greater still. Let‚Äôs shape the future with courage and hope. Would you like help refining the message further?",0,1732883710.0,ClimateShitposting,3,0.33,False
1h2ktls,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1h2ktls/3_weeks_after_quitting_caffeine_i_feel_like_i/,"3 Weeks after quitting caffeine, I feel like I have a new chance in life","I've been wanting to write a long post detailing my personal experience with caffeine and my finds after quitting.

I started drinking coffee regularly from the age of 16, as its quite common in my culture. I never paid too much attention to my coffee habits until one day, some 9 years later, on a camping trip where I did not have access to coffee (forgot to pack some instant) I realized I started having an annoying headache one day without. At the time I was about 25 and was drinking maybe one or two coffees a day. I never felt like I needed coffee, it was for me just a drink that I enjoyed and occasionally I would drink one to wake me up when I had to study for an exam, but would usually be like a cup in the morning, maybe one espresso after lunch, nothing out of the ordinary.

I kept drinking coffee as usual until this year, at the age of 29. I found a new job in a bakery where I can have a free coffee. So I was having a coffee in the morning, another when I arrived at work, and sometimes an extra one after some hours there. 

I stumbled upon this subreddit after looking up caffeine effects. I looked it up because I started having a lot of anxiety at work, unreasonable accesses of paranoia, migraines every once in a while and wondered if my increased caffeine consumption could have anything to do with that.

So one day that I forgot to have a coffee before work, I started wondering if it wouldn't be a good idea to try stop drinking coffee for a bit. So that day I didn't have any coffee at work either. 

Day 1 went fine, maybe I was a bit more tired and distracted than usual.

Day 2 after lunch I started having a big headache, but pushed through. I think I might also have been a little more irritable that day. I resisted the urge to take painkillers.

Day 3 the headache was almost completely gone and has been gone ever since (its now 3 weeks)

After those first three days, I had the realization I had changed something profound in my life.

Almost all of my anxiety is gone. Just before I quit, if I had a sharp pain, I would imagine that I had an aneurism, I was nervous when my managers said hello, my thoughts would be racing with unreal possibilities, if I had a police check for instance, I would get so anxious thinking that they would put me in jail (even though I intellectually new I had never done anything that warrants that, it was like my emotions acted as if that could happen). Now I am way more in control of my thoughts. I might have a fleeting though of doubt, but my intellectual side quickly rules it out. 

That for me is the biggest and most impactful change. Other changes I noticed are:

\> My energy levels are more stable. I wake revigorated now and stay alert with a flat level of energy until night time, while before I woke tired, had a jolt of energy after my coffees, had a crash after some hours and had some trouble going to bed at night.

\> I am way more calm and in control. My emotions no longer rule my actions as I can better put things in perspective. I don't feel the underlying stress that I used to, the constant annoyance and bouts of anger that I used to have.

I feel like almost all of these changes have taken place not long after I quit, but some I am only realizing now, as they are subtle changes and hard to explain, quantify and put into words.

Recently I have been wondering if my consumption hasn't been a cause of issues I had in the past. If it didn't play a role in my anxiety at university, in social situations, my memory problems when studying. 

I am sure it played a role, just don't know to what extent, I am not going to jump and say that caffeine on its own was responsible for my academic failure, but certainly it didn't help. I go back to all the times that I was terrified of giving a class presentation, the sitting back on the back of the class trying to go unnoticed afraid that the teacher would ask me something, the fear of classes where I would have to speak, the stress I had going to uni. 

I just feel so much more stable now, not constantly worried. In a way, I even feel more motivated, as before I would always be thinking about the next thing, jumping from one plan to another, and now I am more grounded and feel capable to follow things through.

Final Thoughts.

I think everyone is different and maybe for most people caffeine in not an issue in any way. But for me it has a huge impact and I wish I had never fell into this habit. I wish I could go back and not having started.

More people should try and stopping for lets say a week and see how they feel. They can always go back to drinking coffee. But this habit is so insidious, so accepted, so not talked about, that most people go through life never even considering the possibility that it might be a problem.

How can I solve it for the relationship to work on the long term ?,"Hello fellow redditors. European here.

My girlfriend and I are in a relationship since almost 6 months now.

Everything was great but I built shit on an evening where I was drunk a month ago and the honeymoon phase ended then. I am not going to talk about this evening since the problem has been sorted out. I am just mentionning it to say that the honeymoon phase is over.

I am going to keep it as short as possible since I know how tidious to read long reddit posts are.

Before the honeymoon phase was over, my girlfriend was a very loving person. She was complimenting me a lot, telling me how attractive I am, and shew me her love phsysically very often. I am not talking about sex specifically but also giving me long and passionate kisses, kissing me on the forehead, cheeks, etc..., cuddling at every occasion and scratching my head.

Since the beginning of the month, she started a new job, which has been quite stressful for her. I support her at 100% for that. She earned pretty well when I met her but now, one can say that she has a very good salary for people from our age and according to the standards of living of the country where we live. I, on my side, earn a very average salary atm. I can still afford to live as I want, since I rarely buy anything. She is not a gold digger at all tho and often offers to pay for dates.

I used to cook everyday at her place (I enjoy cooking and I am good at it so I don't mind doing it) and I ran the errands, most of the time. We don't officially live together but we are always at her place, as long as she is home. My appartment is basically only my gaming room (video games) anymore. I only go there when she is not home. She owns her own house since last year.

She has always been very thankful for me cooking every day for her and, by her words ""To have her back"". To do even more for her, since she started a new job, I also started to wake up every morning with her at 6:30AM (I start work at 9AM) to make her breakfast and her coffee ready, which eats and drink on her way to work, in the subway. An other example is I hurried up make her breakfast ready to go out early to scratch the ice off the windshield of her car, on a very cold morning. I do this all to buy her time, so she can sleep a little longer.

I also plan on starting to study again (she is aware about that). I don't care about my current job anymore, since I am going to quit. This means I have time to invest into supporting my girlfriend and that I don't come home exhausted every day.

She used to be very thankful about me doing that, which is the only thing I ask in return. I just want to make her happy. Happy wife, happy life. The thing is, I have the feeling she takes it for granted. She is not as thankful as she used to be and she doesn't even smile anymore. As if everything I was doing for her was just part of her daily routine and she expects it that way.

When I arrive at her place in the evening, after my daily sport session, she just lays on the sofa or is doing some household chores. I can see that she is not pissed about seeing me (I won't say either she is wonderfully happy tho). We usually then chat a bit about our day, then I go shower, make food, we eat together, watch something on the TV and go to bed.

Sex is becoming more and more rare. She tells me she is too tired to have it (we used to have sex almost every day during the honeymoon phase). I just suck it up and tell her it's allright since I don't want to act too needy or put her under pressure but I'm really missing it. And by missing it, I am not saying I feel the urge to empty my balls. I just miss that connection that it used to build between us.

If we eventually have sex, I just feel as if she wants me to finish as fast as possible (it usually takes her max 5 minutes to orgasm). I miss those ""long"" 20 minutes sex sessions, where I felt very connected with her.

I thought a lot about this situation and tried to read a lot of reddit posts to finally come up with the conclusion that I don't come as ""the man"" in the relationship to her anymore and I just come as the ""nice guy"".

I don't really have friends and no family where we live (she has a shitton of friends, her family and lots of close friends here) since I moved to an other country (it's still important to mention that I speak the language of the country I now live in very fluently). She often go clubbing with her friends. I often go with them if there's not only girls and I always offer to pick her up when she is done, if I'm not partying with her. This usually means to have to stay awake till 5am, playing video games. I don't mind doing it but I have the feeling she also sees that as granted. It's important to mention she tells me every day that she loves me (she often tells it by herself without me saying it first) and that, when I brought up the fact that she doesn't kisses me like before anymore, I could see that she was trying her best to kiss me more often.

I also find it important to mention that she is not the first person I planned a long term relationship with. I used to be together with my ex for 6,5 years and I had other girlfriends before that so I am not really ""unexperienced"". Just wanted to clarify that, for the context.

What do you guys think about that. Am I being used ?



TLDR; Girlfriend doesn't seem grateful anymore for what I do for her. She used to be very grateful in the past. I have the feeling I am doing too much for her and that I have become a ""nice guy"" for her. I am worried about the future of our relationship.",1,1732883288.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

1h2kgnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1h2kgnf/advice_for_christians_quitting_porn_from_a_former/,Advice for Christians quitting porn from a former Addiction Admin,"I am noticing a lot of posts about quitting porn on here. In the past I spent many years as an admin/mod on some of the biggest/most active addiction, nfap, celibacy and retention servers on reddit and discord (**Not encouraging any of those ideas or concepts here)** . I haven't really been active in those spaces for years now but I feel compelled to try to at least put some of you guys on the right track because I see a lot of misguided ideas and failed attempts. Which is fine because I have been there too. I've helped countless people deal with this and hopefully you find something I said to be helpful to you.

Also need to add that **I am not perfect.** There are years I successfully beat this and times where the convenience of the internet tempted me into many misteps if even just for a few days in the year. So this advice isn't from a saint just a former deeply entrenched veteran. I will try to keep it to 10 tips but I am happy to elaborate if anyone needs help.

1. **You need to know the reasons why you consume it and take those reasons seriously.**

Until you can honestly face this then you are really just throwing random solutions at it and hoping something works. Some people will say things like I was horny or just wanted stress relief or was bored. These can be variables on why you are more willing to consume it but it is not the reason why it is an addiction.  Many people are actually seeking out a replacement for intimacy and a connection to feminine energy. Some people it will more be about dopamine or serotonin. Others like myself there might be a true fascination to it as a form of media, beauty and art. Also porn is fun and so is masturbation. Porn taps into needs deeply ingrained in us. It isn't a question why you like porn or you are  addicted to it. Its a better question why everyone isn't doing it all the time why its some how normal yet abnormal in society.

This part here is very important for those trying to figure out the puzzle of their PA. The reasons you consume porn can drastically shift over the years. You may be using old methods on old reasonings for something that is different now. When I was younger sure I started because I was horny but the addiction came because it was a replacement for intimacy after losing women in my life. Some of you may be the opposite by the way @ feminine energy. For me there was a lack of it that suffocated me, I really like women in general as friends, co workers, lovers, etc,... some of you though the opposite might be true. You may be drowning in feminine energy. This too can make you an addict. Being around too many women, pheromones, their effects on your behaviors. **Being around positive masculine energy can be helpful but it is not an antidote to this issue. Very common misconception.** This element of the addiction isn't spoken about enough but just like any addiction...

The people around you and your environment plays a giant role.  Your reasons will tend to stem from things either scarce around you or abundant. Even just Reddit. If porn and porn use is abundant and accepted on Reddit. I am more likely to easily access it and give into it. That is just human.

2. **You need to know what kind of addict you are.** Personally I am the type of addict who can fully beat PA at varying degeneracy levels. Then might take years or months. I assume I have full power over it and myself and it starts with controlled mistakes and then that devolves into uncontrolled ones. Then I wake up and quit again.  In order to avoid failure you need to be very honest about how bad ur addicted and also how you will act. A good way to approach it that is debatable but I have found conceptually works best. Imagine there is a clean version of you who is logical, does the right thing, can see the bad coming and then imagine there is an other you that is dirty it loves the worst porns , it doesnt care about you or your life it just wants to dive into the heep and stay there. This may seem contradicting but the above idea is useful to frame the situations but can be very counter productive in dealing with the issue. You don't want to create this battle between your subpersonalities or versions of yourself. Rather just be aware you are not who you think you are and even if you are. You are not that person all the time. Life shifts, neurochemistry shifts.

3. **In terms of faith you are either someone whose faith really helps you in this battle or someone where faith doesnt help you rather it becomes a source of guilt, distraction and a test of willpower.**  If you are the latter then do not include religion in your journey yet. Very common mistake. Christianity or religion can certainly be one of the most powerful tools in dealing with addiction. Its oddly scientifically proven. However it is a chainsaw. Very powerful. It can be the secret weapon or you can cut your hand off with it.

**I am seeing a lot of cutting your own hand off here on reddit in terms of Christianity and addiction**. I love Christianity  but depending on who you are, you may need to temporarily separate this journey from that for a while. If the tool is not working for you. It is okay to put it down and try another.

4. **Most addictions are misunderstood.** Many things are addictions not because of the reasons often quoted but because they fulfill the purpose you need them for.  Of course there are true chemical addictions but that usually isn't the case especially here. The chemical addiction here is self generated and often unnecessary.

Are you really addicted to caffeine/coffee or is the best tasting, cheapest, most convenient and most effective thing for waking you up? A lot of people are addicted to Starbucks almost none of those people are addicted to black coffee with no sugar.  99% of all addictions in your life is because it is useful and provides a service. If you want to stop using porn so much you need to fulfil those needs. And I do not mean just sex lol, thats just one thing.

One of my needs that shocked me and I mean shocked me. It was aesthetic imagery. I found that if when I got an urge I looked at beautiful art landscapes on Reddit that my brain felt better and the urges went away best.  My other needs were more of the common type. Seeking dopamine, horny, nothing better to do. But note again these are just excuses almost. Real but not compelling element of the addiction. Dopamine wise there are countless sources of dopamine ... countless. The reason you choose porn for the dopamine is the real question. Same with being horny because if it was just about a horny feeling/discomfort then u would have masturbated quickly alone in ur room without porn. It isnt bored either especially with the whole internet at ur hands.

It might really be fulfilling a need for stress relief or the others. But it isnt the reason. You need to fulfil those needs. I spoke about intimacy and having a good relationship with feminine energy before. What I have found for myself personally is when I have lots of good plutonic female friendships and/or my relationship is going well even if no sex is involved. My urges to watch porn drop to an unnoticeable fraction of what it was effortlessly. I am not suggesting to necessarily do this I am just saying its a I need i have that porn was replacing. If no good women are in my life and I isolate I start to degenerate. You need to write down this and all the above. Make a list of the needs the addiction is meeting for you. figure out how to get them elsewhere. Until you do that, when the specific need(s) pop up, you will run to something that is convenient and free ... porn.

5. **Focus foremostly on life, addiction secondarily.** You should of course sort out the above first in understanding and actions. But generally **addiction feeds** on a lack of a life, a lack of alternatives, isolation, lack of relationships, lack of friends, lack of circle, lack of good habits

6. **If you turn it into a battle or a challenge it can become the biggest one you ever fight.** The energy that you put into doing it or fighting it can turn on you tenfold. This is the source of much of the hopelessness and futility. As stated before initially do your best to understand it and prepare. But after that if you inflate this mentally it will stay a huge life long battle. You need to manage it for what it is. Not create a giant life defining issue in your head that manages you. Now in rare cases it might be a really huge problem that requires extreme action. But you are not going to successful do that extreme action required then you are really setting yourself for a constant fight. Learn instead how to calm down. See yourself clearly and porn for what it is clearly. On a simplistic level its really a combination of pixels on your screen, sounds and an interactive interface to speed it up or find more.  It can just be that realistically or it can be a gateway to the ruination of your life. Ironically you get to decide which one. It is a choice. It may always bother you/tempt you but you do not have to make it a big battle or be a slave to it.

7. **If a solution works for you, it doesnt need to make sense to other people. Be ok with random weird solutions.** I have seen a lot of people do things that work for them for a quite some time then they follow some advice or a redditor quoting addiction science  or certain techniques. That fails and they are back where they started. This goes back to what I said before about the reasons you use porn shifting. This includes the solutions. Some solutions may work for 3 years straight then not work for 3 days. Especially if you have neurodivergence/unique traits. I also highly suggest if you are clever enough to create your own solution.

I have one that works very well for me that is a deeper version of grayscale method. I am happy to share it. So if you do not know grayscale method its basically just grayscaling/ removing color from ur screen especailly for social media and porn sites. This drastically reduces how addictive or attractive it is. Your brain responds to colors more than you realize. It control a lot emotions and thoughts.

**My method is a controlled scaling media version.**  
First I grayscale porn. The rule is I can watch as much as I want but it is grayscale. I cannot turn off grayscale. if I am tempted to do that there is a huge penalty like I cannot use the device for 2-3 hours where i must think about why i let myself break my own rule...  So i do that for some days and u will realize u dont even wanna watch it. Its like food with no salt or sugar or sauces. Then i change the format. Then i go to simple images the first day and gray scale images all days after that. Then ur brain gets super tired of that too. Then next day i do audio recordings. Which is interesting but almost no one likes audio recordings except the very rare woman. If u like em then u need to skip this step. Then after audio recordings i scale down to text. I read dirty reddit threads. And by that time I have no interest in the scaled up version of porn. Its super easy to quit reading bad text sex stories on reddit. its 10x easier to quit that than quitting HD video of anything u can imagine instanly.  
If i feel likei am going to make a mistake i just return to text and quit that again. Of course during all this im avoiding masturbation but if it happens then its fine cuz u will not enjoy really so it teaches ur brain how it was being fooled by the media and how u truly dont even need to be doing these things. This works really well for me.  There are a few other unique methods but this one always does the trick.

8. **Yes it is worth dealing with it entirely or at least having a predictable healthy relationship with it as an occasional vice. Beat this addiction and your life improves drastically.** You do need to know that regardless of what other addicts tell you that it is hopeless and just enjoy it or whats the big deal etc. There is a  better life for you if you can get a handle on this. Like I said it doesnt have to be a fight but it is a decision.

9. **It isn't about hacks or perfection. It is about reality.** You do not need to seek perfection or total cold turkey. Some people can do it, like flip a switch and never do it again. I could do that sometimes when I was young. Most people cannot do it and end up destroying themselves further with trying over and over again with huge pain and conviction. Don't do this to yourself. Also understand that many PA admins / retainers etc cheat all the time and lie about it. They pretend to be clean forever but they know their sins.  There are the rare truly clean ones but thinking you will be that out of sheer conviction ... Its like thinking you will be a multi millionaire if u just get serious about saving money tomorrow. I mean it could happen but its way more complex than that.

10. **Avoid trying to convince yourself you hate porn or it is evil or spirt of lust is after you etc.** This goes back to giving it energy part. You can also give it the wrong kind of energy. Imagine you are super obese. Then you start saying how icecream is evil and the spirit of gluttony is after you. That rich people who sell ice cream don't care if they destroy your life etc and should be in jail. I mean who knows might be a lil bit true lol but seriously? This is the way I see many ppl talk about porn and porn companies. They should be irrelevant to you.

Take personal responsibility and accountability just like any addict should. Porn exists. It is meant to be fun and pleasurable. Just like alcohol and drugs. You can admit you enjoy it and take power in knowing that. Then you can decide it no longer as a big place in your life.

Spirituality wise you need to understand in terms of Lust ... you dont fight it. You run from it. There is a line in the bible about that actually. So even from a spiritual perspective stop creating this fight. The reasons people bet on lust , porn, sex so much is because it is an immovable entity. Metaphorically, spiritually and literally you cannot kill it. You can only remove it from your life and avoid it as much as possible.

**Last tip ... Breath is everything**. In all of things whether reading this post or fighting an urge. Breathe deeply , slowly and at the same rhythm. Lust boils with the blood and breath. When not thinking clearly or horny. Breath will bring you back to where you can see clearly. Even if you already starting doing it by mistake. Breathe ... make a logical decision how even your mistake ends. Do not get carried away into deep dark rabbit holes. Breath can prevent porn but it can also reduce its use once you have already started, You will notice too even in sex breathe is everything. Pay attention to ur breathing as much as possible. Breathe clearly through the day. At your pc do not hunch or breathe badly this will slowly stress your body out and cloud ur judgement and reduce ur energy and ur body will seek out things like porn to reset. No one talks about it because it seems subtle and boring but I am telling you is a core thing you can control. Even i**f it helps just 10%** it will be a big weapon for you.

I hope this is helpful. There is no one major magic pill to this but there major tools that will build the foundation/wall necessary. Do not rely on your willpower but your understandings and systems you build with the tools. Feel free to share this with anyone who is struggling with this. It is long but I really hope someone gains the upper hand in reading this.",5,1732882348.0,Christianity,0,0.73,False
