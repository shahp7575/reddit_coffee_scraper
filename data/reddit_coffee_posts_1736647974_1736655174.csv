* Ideal length-to-width ratio: 1.5 to 1.75 for best aesthetics
* Aim for VS2 clarity or better to ensure eye-cleanliness
* Choose H color or higher to minimize visible tinting
* Be aware of the potential bow-tie effect and inspect carefully

1hzedgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1hzedgh/considering_having_the_conversation_about_being/,Considering having “the conversation” about being exclusive. (F43 🇺🇸 & M35 🇧🇷),"I just joined this group, it is my first time posting here. I (F43) met a wonderful man (M35) in November when I was in Brazil. We have been in communication in some form everyday since we met. The spark and connection has been there for both of us since day one. I was in Brazil for 10 days. We saw each other 3 of those 10 days, but we did not start anything romantic until a couple weeks after I returned to the US.
We’re both passionate and romantic people, we both know what we are looking for in a significant other, and the connection has deepened between us pretty quickly. We have not experienced physical intimacy with each other yet. I am returning to Brazil in a few weeks to spend a couple weeks with him. We’re both very excited for our time together.
I’ve started telling people in my life I met someone and we’re dating. He has started doing the same. No relationship statuses have changed on social media yet.
A couple days ago, a guy I’ve known for a while here in the US but have not seen since last spring contacted me out of the blue. He asked me out for coffee. I have not answered him one way or another yet. I’m not quite sure what to do with this invitation yet.
My honey in Brazil and I have had a few conversations in which we’ve both stated we’re not seeing other people and expressed an interest in being exclusive, but there has been no official “are we seeing each other exclusively?” conversation yet. I am wondering if it is a conversation worth having now or waiting to have it when we are together in person. Our communication is frequent, open, and honest and we’ve already had deep conversations about relationships, life goals, etc., conversations a lot of people veer away from in early dating.
I have not mentioned the invitation to my honey yet, nor have I had a conversation directly outlining if we are exclusive. We had an intense, albeit positive, conversation about our relationship the day before I was invited out for coffee. Sometimes my honey needs a couple days to digest intense conversations and is a little less communicative. I recognize this as just how he is and I respect his need for space to process.
Any suggestions or advice regarding the conversation about being exclusive? I don’t believe he is seeing or seeking out other people. I am not seeking out other people, but that doesn’t mean other people are not approaching me. I essentially want to know where we stand before I answer one way or another to the invitation I received.
I’d like be in an exclusive relationship with my honey in Brazil. I’ve never felt the way I feel about him about anyone else. I have not ever met anyone who I am so on the same page with. ",1,1736654784.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False
1hzecno,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hzecno/interviewer_obsessed_over_me/,Interviewer obsessed over me ,"(M) 24 It was a year ago last February 2024, I had an interview at an airline company for barista position.

When I thought  I  botched it  and expecting the interviewer to give me the bad news but to my surprise he offered me the job and start next week. Back then I just started my coffee career and work part time at a coffee chain so I had an anxiety attack and decline the next day.

Though I regretted a bit now but I moved on and became a head barista at another Cafe.

When I thought it's all over, the Airline interviewer contacted me  literally a week ago  saying he started his own venture and wants me to be the manager. Well, given what happened before I'm not really interested plus he setting up shop far from my place so commute's a nightmare. 

But even after I said that, he offered a place nearby to stay and describing the coffee machine he's getting as if I'm the only choice he has.

At this point, I'm creeped out and he seems obsessed with me even I'm sure there's people better than me out there and he kept my resume all this time.

I feel highly disrespected that he invited extra guests without telling me and that he turned my joy into feeling trapped.

He said he will cook. Which doesn’t make me particularly happy since I genuinely wanted to host myself.

I eat a healthy, low carb diet, make most of my own food, try to sleep 8-9 hours/night (caveat with my sleep kinda sucks bc I have chronic hip pain and can’t sleep through the night), drink a ton of water, don’t drink alcohol, take LDN, exercise religiously, do heat/cold therapy, use red light, morning sunlight, delay coffee. 

While all of these things have improved other aspects of my life, I just cannot get my fatigue to improve.

My husband and I live if the DFW metroplex down in ""Hillbilly Hell"" that is TX.  

Neither of us are religious really (I'm more spiritual than anything), and we've been looking at moving here basically since November.  

I got a job offer starting at $85 K, that's a step down in my current job (but it gets us out of here).  My husband works remotely and was let go in December from his IT job.  

Would $85 K be enough temporarily for an apartment, two people, and two corgis?  I know that could support us temporarily down here, but I'm unsure of the buying power up there.  

Any suggestions or things we should NOT do?  Thanks!

Edit: we currently pay over $1,700/mo for a two bed/1.5 bath apartment that's just over 1,100 sq ft.  We live pretty modestly, cook most of our meals, and LOVE good coffee.  We like being outdoors and having actual seasons and are pretty active outside with our dogs when weather permits.

1hze43y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hze43y/date_from_the_dirty_hamper/,Date From the Dirty Hamper ,"TL;DR: Went on a date with a guy I’d been chatting with for a week. He showed up in dirty clothes, greasy hair, and barely engaged in conversation. Should I ghost him or tell him why it didn’t work out?


So, I (32/F) went on a date this morning. Let me set the scene for you.

I had been chatting with this guy (33/M) for about a week. He's a nerdy game producer, owns his own company, house, car—the whole package, right? Sounds promising. Four days in, he drops the bombshell: he's never dated and is a virgin. No big deal, I thought. I can be the bigger one and teach him if it comes to that. But after that convo, I noticed something annoying—I was always the one starting the conversations. Like, dude, give me something here. Eventually, I stopped initiating, and we'd go 15, 16 hours without talking until he finally texted. And we were on Discord, so I knew he was online.

Anyway, we set up a ""meet and greet"" at a fancy coffee shop since we're both matcha latte lovers. Six days in advance, mind you, because he had to ""fit me into his calendar."" I started getting bad vibes the night before. Our conversation styles were not vibing at all. My sister told me to ghost him, but I decided to be the bigger person and show up, even though I really didn’t want to.

Fast forward to this morning: I'm circling the coffee shop, looking for parking, and I get a text from him saying he's there. I glance over and see a guy who looks like him enter the shop. And what is this guy wearing? The ugliest green and orange camo pants I've ever seen. I’m from a family of hunters, so I’m not anti-camo, but come on, not on a first date to a coffee shop! I’m dreading walking in, brainstorming exit strategies.

I finally muster up the courage to go in. And OH MY GOD. This date had been on the calendar for six days, and this is how he shows up? He's wearing a black jacket that’s close to a Carhartt, a tan shirt, a black baseball cap, and sunglasses. Under the cap? Greasy hair that looked like it hadn’t seen shampoo in weeks. The jacket? Covered in white stains—not toothpaste white, but more like… dried jizz white. Hair (beard? pube?) falling off every time he moved his arm. His beard was a mess. The man didn’t even bother to shower or wear clean clothes. I'm convinced he grabbed them from a dirty hamper.

I couldn’t even look at him because he had this massive whitehead on his upper lip. I spent the entire date staring out the window behind him, trying to avoid making eye contact. I sat there for an hour and 20 minutes, out of sheer politeness, while the conversation was just like our online chats—me talking to him, not with him. Barely any responses from him. And I know I talk a lot, but damn, I want someone who can hold a conversation with me.

Lesson learned: listen to your gut and your sister. Ghosting might’ve been the kinder option after all.

Now I’m left with a dilemma. Should I just ghost him and move on with my life, or should I tell him why this date was such a disaster? I mean, part of me wants to give him some feedback so he doesn't show up like this for someone else, but I also don’t want to come off as mean or condescending. What would you do? Ghost or let him know?

1hze35o,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hze35o/whispers_of_the_black_horizon_the_silvereyed_woman/,Whispers of the Black Horizon: The Silver-Eyed Woman,"Marcus Blackwood noticed the woman for the first time in a photograph of an empty street. She stood in the shadow of a lamppost, face turned away, wearing what looked like a grey dress that rippled in a wind that hadn't existed that night. He might have dismissed it as a trick of light and shadow, except that he'd taken three shots of that same street corner, and she appeared in a different position in each one.

His darkroom behind Sterling Books had always been his sanctuary. The familiar scent of developing chemicals and the soft red glow of the safelights usually brought him peace. But tonight, as he hung the prints side by side, something felt wrong. The woman's poses changed subtly between images - head tilted at different angles, arms raised or lowered, dress flowing in impossible directions. But it was her placement that bothered him most. In the first photo, she stood beneath the lamppost. In the second, she'd moved halfway down the street. In the third, she was barely visible in a doorway, as if retreating from his lens.

The chemicals in their trays reflected the red safelight, and Marcus could have sworn he saw ripples move across their surface though he hadn't touched them. His fingers left prints on the white borders of the photographs - prints that seemed darker than they should be, as if the ink from the images was seeping into his skin.

A knock at the door made him jump. ""Mr. Blackwood? Are you in there?""

Marcus recognized Leonard Kane's voice. The man had become a regular at Sterling Books over the past few months, spending hours browsing the photography section and asking questions about Marcus's work. Kane had an intensity about him that Marcus had initially found unsettling - the way he would stare at photographs for hours, making notes in his little leather book, muttering to himself about patterns and signs.

""Come in,"" Marcus called, switching on the white lights. ""And I've told you before - it's just Marcus.""

Kane entered, blinking at the brightness. His wire-rimmed glasses caught the light, momentarily obscuring his eyes. Today he wore his usual tweed jacket with leather patches at the elbows, and his fingers were stained with ink from whatever he'd been writing. ""I wanted to ask about the new series you're working on. The night shots of the city?""

Marcus gestured to the prints. ""See for yourself. Though I'm not sure what I'm seeing anymore.""

Kane studied the photos, leaning close enough that his breath fogged the glossy surface. Marcus watched as Kane's expression shifted from curiosity to something else - recognition, perhaps, or fear. ""The woman,"" he said softly. ""She's... moving between the frames?""

""Impossible, right? These were taken within seconds of each other.""

Kane's fingers traced the air above the woman's figure, not quite touching the paper. His hand trembled slightly. ""Have you seen her anywhere else?""

""Not yet. But I'm going back tonight. Same location, same time.""

""Be careful,"" Kane said, then seemed to catch himself. ""I mean, with the exposure settings. Night photography can be tricky."" He pulled out his notebook - a small, leather-bound thing with pages that seemed to rustle even when there was no breeze - and made a quick note.

That evening, Marcus returned to the street corner with his camera. The October air carried a hint of winter, and fog gathered in the spaces between buildings like cotton wool. The streetlights created pools of yellow illumination that didn't quite reach far enough, leaving deeper shadows than usual between them. He set up his tripod in the exact spot he'd used before, checking and rechecking the angle.

The street was empty except for a stray cat that watched him from a doorway, its eyes reflecting the streetlights in a way that made them look silver. As Marcus adjusted his camera settings, the cat suddenly hissed and darted away, as if something had frightened it.

Through his viewfinder, the street looked normal at first. Then a movement caught his eye - a figure in grey, standing where no one had been a moment before. Her dress rippled in that strange wind, and this time he could see her face, though he wished he couldn't. Silver tears traced paths down her cheeks, leaving trails that seemed to shimmer in the darkness. Where the tears fell, the pavement appeared to ripple like the surface of a pond.

Marcus's finger pressed the shutter release. The woman turned toward him, her movement too fluid to be natural. Each tear that fell from her silver eyes left a mark in the air itself, like burn holes in a piece of paper. The street lights flickered, their light dimming as she passed beneath them.

He took shot after shot as she moved closer, each step bringing her further from the realm of things he could explain. Her limbs bent at angles that made his eyes hurt. The silver trails of her tears began to spread, eating holes in the reality around her. The fog swirled around her form, taking shapes that reminded Marcus of letters in an alphabet he'd never seen.

When he finally lowered the camera, the street was empty. His hands shook as he packed up his equipment. The fog had thickened, forming shapes that disappeared when he looked at them directly. The stray cat was back, watching him from its doorway, but something about its shape seemed wrong now, as if its body couldn't quite decide how many legs it should have.

Back in his darkroom, Marcus found the developing fluid moving strangely, swirling in patterns that had nothing to do with his agitation of the tray. As the first image began to appear, he noticed dark stains on his fingers that wouldn't wipe away. They looked like ink at first, but as he watched, they began to form patterns that reminded him of the shapes he'd seen in the fog.

The photos emerged from the dark waters one by one, each revealing more than he remembered seeing through his lens. In some, the woman's dress seemed to merge with the fog around her, creating shapes that hurt his eyes to look at. In others, her figure doubled and trebled, twisting her body in ways that defied nature. But it was her face that held him transfixed - a face that changed between prints, as if she wore reality itself like a mask that kept slipping.

The silver tears in the photographs seemed to glow faintly in the darkroom's red light. As Marcus hung the prints to dry, he noticed that the paper felt different where the tears had fallen - thinner somehow, as if something was eating through from the other side.

""Remarkable work.""

Marcus spun around. A woman stood in the darkroom doorway, though he hadn't heard it open. She wore an elegant black dress that seemed to absorb the red safelight rather than reflect it, and her eyes caught the light in a way that made them look like burning coals. Her movements as she entered the room were too smooth, as if she glided rather than walked.

""Who are you? How did you get in here?""

""Terrane Askel,"" she said, moving closer to examine the prints. Her fingernails left faint scratches in the air itself as she gestured. ""I've been watching your progress with great interest. Few photographers manage to capture her so clearly.""

""You know who she is?""

""Serakali, The Weeping Moonsower."" Terrane's fingers traced the silver tear tracks in the nearest photo. Where she touched, the paper seemed to grow transparent. ""Her tears reshape reality. And you, Marcus Blackwood, have been chosen to document her work.""

""I don't understand.""

""You will."" She produced a small book bound in dark leather. The cover seemed to move slightly under Marcus's gaze, as if something was pressing against it from the inside. ""Keep photographing her. Record what you see. But understand that such knowledge comes with a price.""

After she left, Marcus found himself unable to stop staring at the places where Serakali's tears had fallen in the photographs. The paper there seemed thinner, as if the image had worn away the paper to reveal something beneath. In one print, he could have sworn he saw movement behind the paper, like shapes pressing against a thin membrane.

Kane found him there the next morning, still studying the prints. ""You look terrible,"" he said, setting down two cups of coffee. Steam rose from the cups in patterns that reminded Marcus of the writing that had appeared on his hands. ""Were you here all night?""

Marcus showed him the new photos. Kane's hands shook as he looked through them, and his face grew increasingly pale. His notebook lay open beside him, its pages covered in cramped writing that seemed to shift when Marcus tried to read it. ""You need to stop,"" Kane said finally. ""This isn't... This isn't right.""

But Marcus couldn't stop. Over the next weeks, he photographed Serakali again and again. Each session revealed more of her true nature. His photos began to change even after they were developed, the images slowly transforming in their frames. He started taking pictures of the same photographs day after day to track their changes, but his camera would sometimes capture things he couldn't explain - extra figures that appeared between frames, shadows that moved against the light, tears that fell upward.

The stains on his hands spread, forming patterns that looked like writing in a language he almost understood. His dreams filled with silver tears and impossible angles. Sometimes he woke to find himself in the darkroom with no memory of going there, new prints hanging on the lines that he had no memory of developing. The images in these prints showed places that couldn't exist - streets that bent back on themselves, buildings that extended into spaces that shouldn't be there, skies filled with things that made him wake up screaming.

Kane watched it all with growing horror, making notes in his small book he carried everywhere. The notebook had grown thicker somehow, though Kane never added pages to it. Sometimes Marcus caught glimpses of text writing itself across the pages when Kane wasn't looking. ""Please,"" he begged one evening, ""You have to see what's happening to you. To this place.""

He was right about the changes to Sterling Books. The shelves seemed to rearrange themselves at night. Customers reported seeing movement in their peripheral vision. Text began bleeding between books, creating hybrid volumes that contained impossible knowledge. The store's front window would fog up on clear days, and in the condensation, words would appear in flowing script that vanished when approached.

The darkroom felt different too. The dark waters in the trays moved with purpose now, forming patterns in their trays that matched the writing on Marcus's hands. The shadows in the corners grew deeper, and sometimes he caught glimpses of faces in the darkness between the safelights. The photographs on the drying lines would whisper when no one was watching, their surfaces rippling like water in a light breeze.

On the last night, Marcus set up his final shoot. The camera felt heavier than it should, and through the viewfinder, he could see things moving in the spaces between buildings - things that vanished when he lowered the camera. He had to document everything - the way reality bent around Serakali's form, the patterns her tears left in the air, the truth behind her silver eyes. Kane watched from the doorway, unable to intervene but unwilling to leave.

The developing fluid moved like living mercury, rising up to meet Marcus's hands as he worked. Text appeared in the liquid, forming passages that matched the writing that now covered his arms completely. Each print that emerged showed more than the last, revealing layers of reality that human eyes were never meant to see. The images captured not just light and shadow, but something else - something that existed in the spaces between what was real and what was possible.

When they found him the next morning, the developing tray contained something that was no longer just chemicals - a fluid black as cosmic void, shot through with fragments of text that wrote and rewrote themselves endlessly. Marcus Blackwood's body was bent at angles that mirrored his final photographs, silver tears frozen on his cheeks. The camera held no trace of the pictures he'd taken, but the prints hanging on the line showed things that made the first responders flee the darkroom in terror.

Kane took over Sterling Books after that. The transformation of the shop accelerated under his ownership. Books would rearrange themselves overnight, finding new companions that shared their evolving nature. The photography section grew darker somehow, as if the shadows there had weight and substance. Customers began to notice that the photographs they browsed would change after they set them down, the images shifting like memories that couldn't quite hold their shape.

Kane preserved Blackwood's collection with obsessive care. The photographs continued to change in their frames, each one a window into something vast and hungry. Some showed angles of reality that shouldn't exist - buildings that folded in on themselves, streets that led to places that had never existed in London. Others contained glimpses of a horizon where all light failed, where something vast and patient waited for its time to emerge. And in every one, somewhere in the background, Serakali watched with silver eyes that wept for what was coming.

The photographs had to be covered at night - the few times Kane forgot, customers would report hearing crying from the walls, and silver tears would pool on the floor beneath the frames. The tears left marks that wouldn't fade, forming patterns that matched the writing in Kane's notebook. Sometimes in the morning, he would find new photographs had appeared in the frames, showing places and things he knew Blackwood had never captured.

The darkroom became a shrine of sorts. Kane found himself spending more time there, studying the changes in the chemical trays that never quite dried up. The developing fluid moved like something alive now, forming shapes that reminded him of the letters appearing on his skin. He began to understand why Blackwood had been unable to stop - there was a beauty in the horror, a terrible truth in the silver tears that kept falling.

Regular customers started to notice changes in Kane himself. His movements became more deliberate, as if he was always posing for an unseen camera. His eyes reflected light at strange angles, and sometimes people swore they saw tears tracking silver down his cheeks. The stains on his hands spread up his arms like ink through water, forming words in languages that hurt to read.

He took to wearing long sleeves to hide the marks, but customers sometimes caught glimpses of the writing that crawled across his skin. Those who saw it too clearly stopped coming to the shop, but others - those who felt the pull of Serakali's tears - began to linger longer in the photography section. They would stand for hours, staring at images that seemed to move when no one was watching.

The shop's front window became a gallery of sorts. Kane displayed only the most subtle of Blackwood's photographs there, but even these caused strange effects. Passersby would stop, transfixed by images that seemed to shift and change as they walked past. On foggy mornings, the glass would weep silver tears that left permanent tracks in the wooden windowsill.

Kane cataloged everything in his notebook, which had begun to write itself when he wasn't looking. The pages multiplied somehow, though he never added new ones. The ink moved of its own accord, forming words in languages that existed only in the spaces between thoughts. His handwriting changed too, becoming more like the fluid script that had appeared on Blackwood's hands in those final days.

In time, Detective Katherine Drake would stand in this same room, looking at these same photographs, trying to understand what she saw in their shifting surfaces. But by then, Kane's own transformation would be well underway. The silver tears would fall freely down his cheeks as he showed her Blackwood's final works, each image a testament to the truth that had consumed their creator.

The photographs continued their slow change, drawing in new eyes, new minds, new souls. Each viewer added something to their evolution, and Kane watched it all, recording every detail in his ever-growing notebook. He understood now what Blackwood had discovered - that some truths could only be captured in silver tears and impossible angles, in images that changed the very reality they claimed to document.

And somewhere in the shadows of Sterling Books, in the spaces between what was real and what was possible, Serakali continued her patient work. Her tears fell like silver rain, marking those who would follow in Blackwood's footsteps, guiding them one by one toward the horizon where all light failed and something vast and hungry waited for its time to emerge.",0,1736653816.0,scarystories,0,0.5,False

My ex and I broke up a few weeks ago, and it’s been pretty tough as there is definitely still feelings on both sides. However, we’re in the process of exchanging our belongings as the final step before going no contact for a long while (she’s got my Nintendo Switch 😤)

As we both work during the week, I was expecting to hear from her this weekend to exchange stuff. We had planned to do it earlier in the week but she couldn’t find the strength to see me. Anyway, I reached out early this afternoon (Sunday for us) and asked if I could grab it off her. She replied that she was out and likely wouldn’t be back til later, and asked to do after work tomorrow. Upon hearing this, my mind went straight to thinking she was out with someone else on some date or whatever (even though I know that’s illogical, as she specifically said she didn’t want to be with anyone and the break up was so she could get time alone to sort a few things out mentally). I instantly became cold and basically told her “yeah whatever” and insinuated that maybe it’s best if she just drop it off instead of us seeing each other, which was something I was (maybe stupidly) looking forward to. 

I hate how I acted for that short couple of minutes, and felt like I was a baby spitting out my dummy. I’m not normally like that, but felt insane jealousy and a bit of anger in that brief moment. I took myself off to the beach to grab a coffee by myself and chill, and that’s where I’m currently at while I write this. Does anyone else get like this?

1hze0ix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hze0ix,Little America (2020) *2 Seasons,"Watching ""Little America"" feels like diving into a Tumblr feed of diverse narratives, each episode a standalone gem that hits right in the feels. The show captures the immigrant experience in ways that feel real, raw, and relatable, far from the typical Hollywood trope. There's this beautiful, messy authenticity to it—the joy, the struggles, the culture shock, all wrapped in stories that resonate, no matter where you're from or where you're at in life. And can we talk about the cinematography for a sec? Each frame feels like it was plucked right out of an indie film festival, making you want to hit pause just to soak in the visuals.

But let’s not sugarcoat it. ""Little America"" isn't without its flaws. Some episodes drag a bit, losing the tight, punchy narrative that keeps you hooked. There are moments where the storytelling gets a little too neat, too predictable—like they're trying to tick all the boxes of what makes a feel-good drama. And while the show champions diversity, sometimes it feels like it's checking off a diversity checklist rather than letting the stories breathe on their own. It’s like, ""Hey, look at us, we’re so inclusive!"" Yeah, we get it, but don’t force it.

Overall, though, it's a refreshing break from the same-old-same-old. ""Little America"" is that friend who tells you heartfelt stories over coffee, leaving you feeling a little more connected, a little more empathetic. It's not perfect, but its heart is in the right place, and that counts for a lot. If you’re looking for something that’s got soul and substance, it’s definitely worth your watch. Just be prepared for a few episodes that might test your patience a bit.

1hzdy9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hzdy9e/i_22f_am_now_realizing_that_my_best_friend_22m/,I (22F) am now realizing that my best friend (22M) maybe have actually had feelings for me as teenagers and now I don’t know what to do,"Oh man. This all has hit me like a freight train these last couple days.
Backstory:
When we were 13 and just starting 8th grade, me (we’ll call K) and my best friend (we‘ll call C) met during one of our extracurricular activities and shortly afterwards became very close. We remained close all throughout junior high,  high school and for some time after high school.
Our friends and family always commented on how cute we would be as a couple and things like that and I always shut it down or brushed it off because although yeah at times there were moments where I felt I could see him as more than a friend, I also felt like there was no way he would ever be interested in someone like me in a romantic way. He was the extroverted, funny, everyone’s friend kinda guy and I was more the quiet, reserved and maybe even “nerdy” kinda girl.

During our friendship we would go to a local cafe and would just sit and talk for hours sometimes weekly and most times he’d walk me home before walking home himself to the other side of town (before we both had our own cars obvi), we’d go out for dinner together to local restaurants, watch movies at his place, exchange Christmas gifts, and eventually we became pretty close with each others families.

I don’t know, maybe it’s because I’m older now and have been in some not great relationships with some not great guys that has kind of opened my eyes to all of these things and the way he treated me all those years ago…

Most notably:

* My graduation ceremony when my boyfriend at the time refused to go with me because he was going to hang out with friends (one of those friends being C). As I was getting ready, C called me and he could hear in my voice that I was upset and when I told him why his response was “I’ll be there in 20 minutes” and showed up to be there with me and waited on hanging out with those friends

* A graduation party my mom threw for me a while later where she had invited him and his family and I didn’t think he’d be able to make it, but surprised me by showing up and with flowers for me

* He bought me a very beautiful (and no doubt expensive, especially for a 17 y/o) wallet when he was on vacation out of the country

* During a large gathering with our friends, a few of them were playing music and he asked me to dance with him and got our friends to play a sorta-slow, waltz like song and him and I danced together in front of all our friends and others who were at the same place we all were

* Most times when we’d be on road trips for one of our extra curriculars and we’d sit together and he’d either have his arm around me or I’d fall asleep on his shoulder

*  One time in particular when we were definitely like cuddling while watching a movie until I became too aware of how close we were and moved out of fear I was making him uncomfortable

* During a local festival and we went together during the day and later went back to his grandparents house for a bit and then went back into town to watch the fireworks together 

And honestly there’s just so many examples of things like that too.

It all kind of hit me when my ex boyfriends and I, after trying to work on things for a short while broke up again, and I began reflecting on the way he treated me and spoke to me and it hit me that the way I wanted to express to treat me was the way C had treated me all those years we were friends.

My ex definitely isolated me from all my old friends and while I’ve slowly been mending other friendships, I’m nervous to message him as we haven’t talked in a few months and haven’t seen each other in person in well over a year.

Also maybe sort noting: around the time of our high school graduation he had a girlfriend and I had started seeing my now ex. As I got deeper into my old relationship the less I spoke to and hung out with C.
Him and his ex broke up a couple years ago but he has since gotten a new girlfriend approx 1.5 years ago and I broke up with my ex just under 1 year ago.

So my questions:

1. Is it possible that all these things C and I did together or the things he did were actually indications of other feelings and I was just too blind to see it? Or am I being delusional? 
2. Could I maybe ask C to hang out when I’m in our town again?  Would it be weird for me to ask him to go out for coffee or something after so much time has passed and he has a new girlfriend? - He never did let his ex come in between us and unfortunately I did let my ex come between our friendship (which I know wasn’t fair and I have apologized to C for that). I also would mention this to him if I did see him again obvi out of respect for his relationship.

I am so lost on what to do here. 
I miss my best friend. 
I miss our laughs and hanging out and everything.
I always knew if there was never going to be more between us I still valued him and his friendship so so much and which is why I never brought any of this up to him before. 

Please someone tell me what to do.",0,1736653356.0,relationship_advice,5,0.33,False

어제는 어머니 집에 저녁 늦게까지 있다 왔습니다. 늦게 자고 늦게 일어나버렸네요. 역시나 헬스장 가는 발걸음이 잘 떨어지지 않습니다. 그래도 일단 신발을 신으면 가게 됩니다. 어제 충분히 잠도 잔 것 같지만 식사수면 간격이 30분밖에 안되고 어제의 수면 정중시간과 차이가 1시간이나 벌어졌습니다. 잠을 자도 피곤하다는 말이 절로 나옵니다. 그래서 오늘은 겨우겨우 근력운동 몇가지 생략하고 마지막 스퍼트도 1분만 하고 내려왔습니다. 수면의 양이 많아도 피곤하다면 규칙성과 질을 결정하는 빛노출/빛차단, 카페인 섭취, 특히 총 식사시간 10시간 미만이 제일좋고 식사와 수면 간격은 3시간은 띄어야 수면 질이 좋습니다. 어제는 수명량 빼고는 모든 것이 엉망이다 보니 어쩔 수 없습니다. 어차피 늦은 김에 아이와 아내가 늦잠을 좀더 자라는 의미에서 아침은 좀 늦게 먹더라도 글이나 오래 써야겠습니다.\^\^

어제 저녁에 \[그레인브레인\] 저자의 후속 책인 클린 브레인이라는 책이 식탁 의자위에 있길래 아무 페이지나 펴서 보았습니다. 과당을 섭취하면 전전두피질과 변연계의 연결성이 낮아지고 변연계의 도파민 중독회로가 날뛰면서 욕구에 대한 통제능력을 떨어트린다는 연구 논문을 이야기합니다. 그리고 뉴스 속보가 뇌를 망가뜨린다라는 소제목도 보입니다.

쾌감을 올리는 행위는 변연계의 도파민을 활성화시킵니다. 그리고 도파민의 농도가 급격히 떨어지면서 금단증상과 갈망감정이 올라오고 초조해지고 불안해집니다. 술, 담배, 밀가루(글루테오몰피), 설탕(과당)은 우리를 충동적으로 만들고 전전두피질을 약화시킵니다. 운동, 독서, 명상은 전전두피질을 강화시키고 술, 담배, 밀가루, 설탕에 대한 나의 통제력을 올려줍니다. 전전두피질에서의 도파민 상승은 금단증상, 내성증상이 없고 지속적으로 행복한 기분을 만듭니다. 항상 제가 하는 이야기이지만 \[그레인 브레인\]의 저자 데이비드 펄머터도 후속작 \[클린 브레인\]에서 같은 이야기를 하는 것을 보면 모든 길은 하나로 통하나 봅니다.

​

제글이 너무나 금욕주의적이고 비판적이고 지금 당장 무언가를 하라는 압박을 하기에 불편하신 분도 많으실 겁니다. 그냥 할 수 있는 것에서 하시면 됩니다. 어차피 공부든 성공이든 그저 시작하는 것만이라도 상위 10%에 해당하는 겁니다. 나머지 90%는 시도조차 하지 않으니까요\^\^ 그저 하루하루 살아나가는 것이 조금 씩 나아지기도 하고 뒤로 물러서기도 하면서 멀리서 보면 어느순간 큰 산의 중턱까지 올라간 자신이 있지 않을까 싶습니다.

​

이 시국에 운동, 독서, 명상을 하는 것이 가끔은 무슨 소용인가라는 생각이 들때도 있었습니다. 그런 마음을 잡아주는 유튜브가 있길래 공유합니다. 제가 좋아하는 김주환 교수님도 그러한 질문을 많이 받았나 봅니다. 배우 지훈님이 교수님에게 갑자기 질문을 합니다. 덕분에 저의 궁금증을 해소가 어느정도되었습니다.

**\[세포리셋\]**

**​**

**3장. 모든 질병은 장에서 시작된다**

**​**

**6. 제2의 뇌가 우리몸에서 하는일\_장신경계**

​

장신경계의 신경세포 수는 약 6억개입니다. 그래서 붙은 별명이 '제2의 뇌'죠. 실제로 장신경계는 스스로 학습하고 기억한다는 주장도 나오고 있습니다. 실제로 중추신경계의 명령없이 음식을 먹으면 스스로 반사적으로 움직이며 기본적인 기능을 수행하는 것이 밝혀졌습니다.

​

소화기능은 부교감이 우세해야지만 정상적으로 움직입니다. 교감신경이 우세해지면 소화기능은 잠시 쉽니다. 우리가 흔히 아는 질환인 과민성대장증후군, 염증성 장질환, 음식 알레르기 과민증, 변비, 설사는 장신경계 이상을 동반한 것이라 보면 됩니다. 그리고 최근에는 파킨슨, 알츠하이머, 다발성경화증, 자폐 스펙트럼 장애 등도 장신경계와 관련이 있다는 연구가 보고됩니다. => 관련 리퍼런스를 나중에 찾아보려고 적어 놓겠습니다.

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7495222/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7495222/)(**The Enteric Nervous System and Its Emerging Role as a Therapeutic Target)**

[**https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5005185/**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5005185/)**(The bowel and beyond: the enteric nervous system in neurological disorders)**

​

장신경계는 장관만 있는 것이 아니라 담낭, 췌장 등이 소화효소를 분비합니다. 수술을 통해 담낭이나 췌장을 절제한 분은 장신경계가 정상으로 되기까지 많은 시간이 필요합니다.

https://preview.redd.it/hioysi03fhce1.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eedbeb5226652cf05bee813ade515a202e61974

  
신경은 한번 절단되면 재생이 안되는 것으로 알려져 있지만 그렇지 않습니다. 재생 속도가 느릴 뿐 꾸준히 재활을 하면 회복이 됩니다. 절단된 신경이 서로 연락해서 다시 연결되기까지는 보통 1년 넘는 시간이 필요합니다. 외부에서 꾸준히 담즙액/췌장효소 같은 보조제를 받고 꾸준히 부교감을 향상시키는 노력을 해야 합니다.

​

**장신경계를 손상시키는 요인들**

​

**1) 뮤신 기능 이상**

​

장상피세포를 보호하는 당단백질 성분의 물리적 장벽을 뮤신(장 점액층)이라하는데 장 점막의 염증 억제하는 보호막 뿐 아니라 세포 내부로 시그널을 전달하고, 영양소를 흡수하게 하고, 이물질과 세균의 침투를 억제하는 중요한 기능을 합니다.

​

점액층의 두께가 얇아지거나 조성이 바뀌면 염증반응과 함께 이물질이 장 점막을 뚫고 들어와 면역반응이 발현됩니다. 점액은 술잔세포 goblet cell에서 만들어지며 술잔세포는 줄기세포에서 분화해 2\~3일 정도 시간이 흘러야 성숙됩니다. 소장에만 존재하는 파네스 세포 paneth cell는 항균 펩타이드 antimicrobial peptide를 분비해 소장 내 세균의 증식을 억제합니다.

​

**2) 소장 내 세균 과잉 증식**

​

소장에서는 세균 증식이 되면 안됩니다. 장신경계 이상으로 소장-대장 괄약근이 느슨해져서 대장에 있던 세균이 소장으로 이주해서 증식이 일어나면 소장 점악의 점액층에 변화가 생깁니다. 증식한 세균에서 나오는 독소가 장 점막을 자극해 염증 반응을 일으킵니다. 단순하게 생각하면 세균의 과증식이므로 항생제를 사용하면 될 것 같지만 일시적으로 증상이 경감되지만 장신경계가 정상으로 돌아오지 않으면 재발합니다.

​

**3) 자율신경 불균형**

​

장신경계가 스스로 작용을 한다고 해도 주요 조절은 교감과 부교감입니다. 그래서 항상 교감과 부교감의 밸런스를 잘잡아줘야 합니다.

**​**

**4) 아세틸콜린 부족**

​

부교감신경의 말단에서 분비하는 신경전달물질인 아세틸콜린은 장 점막세포에서 점액을 분비되게 도와주며, 장운동을 촉진하는 역할을 합니다. 아세틸콜린Acetylcholine은 탄수화물과 지방산의 대사로 생상된 아세틸조효소 acetyl-coenzymeA와 콜린 choline의 결합으로 형성되는데 이를 촉진하는 영양소가 비타민B1과 콜린입니다. 비타민 B1과 콜린이 풍부한 음식은 동물 복지 달걀노른자, 유기농 돼지고기, 익힌 자연산 연어 및 강낭콩 등의 섭취를 저자는 추천합니다. => 계란, 돼지고기 드시면 될 것 같습니다. 동물복지/유기농/자연산 등은 저도 그렇게 신경쓰진 못합니다. 물론 신경쓰시면 더 좋겠죠\^\^

​

**5) 세로토닌 결핍**

​

아세틸콜린 분비를 촉진해 장의 연동운동을 도와주는 세로토닌 serotonin은 90% 이상이 장에서 만들어집니다. 세로토닌 전구물질인 트립토판 tryptophan의 부족 때문일 수도 있으나 중간 조효소 역할을 하는 비타민C, 비타민 B6, 비타민B9 그리고 마그네슘의 부족과 연관이 있습니다.

​

비타민SNPs 검사에서 비타민B군의 활성화 유전자에 변이가 있는 경우에는 비타민B6, 비타민B9을 복용하더라도 몸속에서 활성형태인 P5P pyridoxal 5 phosphate, 메틸 엽산 methyl-folate으로 만들 수 없기 때문에 세로토닌 결핍 증상이 나타날 수 있습니다. 이런 분은 활성 비타민 B군과 지용성 비타민C를 섭취하길 권합니다. => 이 책 부록에 SNP 관련 내용이 나오는데 저도 유전자 돌연변이가 이렇게 빈번한지 몰랐습니다. 어쩌면 한번쯤은 검사를 하고 활성형(처방전필요) 비타민은 따로 챙겨할 목록을 확인하고 복용하는 수 밖에 없습니다.

​

트립토판은 필수아미노산으로 식물성보다는 동물성 식재료에 풍부하고 칠면조, 닭가슴살, 쇠고기, 돼지고기, 연어 등에 풍부하고 두부에도 많습니다. 트립토판이 아무리 풍부해도 염증반응이 진행되면 트립토판을 통해 세로토닌을 만들기보다는 염증물질인 키누레닌 kynurenine이 생성됩니다. 키누레닌은 혈액을 타고 뇌로 올라가 혈액-뇌 장벽을 통과해 뇌속에 염증 반응이 발현되고 유기산 검사에서 키누레신이 증가한 환자는 실제로 우울증, 불면, 두통을 호소하는 경우가 많습니다. => 예전에 트립토판이 염증 반응을 거치면 해마를 공격해서 치매 발병률이 상승한다는 내용을 책에서 봤는데 제 블로그를 검색해봐야겠네요. 정리를 해도 모두 외우긴 어렵습니다.ㅜ.ㅜ

**3. 보충제**

​

저자도 언급하지만 수십년 전에 수련을 받은 오늘날의 의사들 중에는 영양, 그리고 영양이 건강에 미치는 영향에 대해 확실하게 알지 못하는 사람이 많다는 점이다. 내가 몸담고 있는 의료계 사람들의 얼굴에 먹칠을 하고 싶어서 하는 말이 아니다. 그저 경제 문제에서 비롯된 진실을 지적하고 있을 뿐이다. 부디 다음 세대의 의사들은 치료쪽으로 지나치게 치우쳐 있는 추를 예방쪽으로 움직여 균형을 맞출 준비가 되어 있기를 바라는 마음이다. => 충분히 공감합니다. ㅜ .ㅜ 저도 3년전에는 영양제, 보충제, 식이, 운동, 수면에 대해서 무시했으니까요. 반성합니다.

​

**1) DHA**

​

DHA는 뇌의 오메가3 지방 중 90% 이상을 차지 합니다. 뉴런의 형질막 plasma membrane(진핵 세포에서 세포의 안팎을 구분해주는 막) 무게 중 50%는 DHA로 이루어져 있으며 심장조직에서도 핵심 성분입니다.

​

저자는 강연할 때 의사들에게 자연에서 가장 풍부한 DHA공급원이 무엇이라 생각하느냐고 자주 묻는다고 합니다. 그러면 대구 간유, 연어기름, 정어리 기름 등 온갖 답변이 나옵니다. 아마씨유나 아보카드유도 이야기합니다. 하지만 아닙니다. 자연에서 가장 풍부한 DHA는 사람의 모유입니다. 아동의 신경 건강과 장기적인 수행능력에서 모유수유의 중요성이 지속적으로 강조되는 이유입니다.

​

EPA가 함께 들어있든 DHA만 있든 상관없이 먹으면 됩니다.

​

**2) MCT 혹은 코코넛 오일**

​

MCT 오일은 HDL을 증가시킬 수 있는 훌륭한 형태의 포화지방산입니다. 심지어 코코넛 오일은 MCT 오일 덕분에 뇌의 슈퍼 연료가 되어 줍니다. 여러 논문을 보면 MCT는 기억력과 인지기능을 향상 시킬 뿐 아니라 신경 퇴행성 질환의 예방과 치료를 돕는 효과가 있습니다.

​

미국 심장협회에서는 2017년에 발표한 대통령 자문 보고서에서 코코넛 오일을 건강에 해로운 지방으로 분류했지만 이점을 분명히 밝히고 싶습니다. 미국 심장협회는 과학을 오도하였을 뿐 아니라 대구콩기름과 같은 다불포화 기름의 이점을 극찬할 때 미국 심장협회가 리버티 링크 대두콩 생산자인 바이엘 크롭 사이언스로부터 자금지원을 받는 다는 사실을 밝히지도 않았습니다. 미국 심장협회의 이러한 행태를 고발한 글을 보고 싶으면 게리 타우브스가 'CardioBrief.org'에 올린 신랄한 비평을 보시면 됩니다.

​

저자는 하루에 코코넛 오일에서 추출한 MCT 오일을 하루에 1큰 술씩 섭취할 것을 권장합니다. 순수한 코코넛오일은 2큰술을 섭취하면 됩니다. 커피나 차에 MCT 오일이나 코코넛오일을 첨가해도 되고 열에 안정적이기 때문에 고온의 조리에도 사용하면 됩니다. => 저는 MCT 오일은 코코넛 냄새도 안나고 액체로 되어 있어서 식용유로 씁니다. 올리브오일도 쓰구요. 하지만 코코넛 오일은 코코넛 특유의 향이 나고 고체라서 가끔씩 샐러드에 치즈와 같이 넣어서 먹습니다.

​

**3) 강황**

​

생강과의 한 종인 강황 curcuma loga은 현재 뜨거운 과학연구 대상입니다. 강황의 유효 성인 쿠르쿠민이 항염증, 항산화 작용에 관한 연구가 많습니다. 카레가루가 노란색인 이유도 강황 때문입니다. 특히 인지기능, 치매 관련 검사에서 높은 점수가 나옵니다.

​

쿠르쿠민의 비밀 무기 중 하나는 다양한 항산화제를 생산하는 유전자를 활성화하는 능력입니다. 이것은 미토콘드리아를 보호합니다. 포도당 대사도 개선해줍니다. => 문제는 우리나라는 카레가 설탕이 너무 많고 강황성분은 적을 것으로 추정됩니다. 실제로 카레덮밥이 아니라 카레향 설탕 밥이라고 불러야 할 정도니 말이죠. 그래서 저도 커큐민 영양제를 구입하려고 합니다. 현재는 베르베린만 추가한 상태인데요. 추가 예정입니다.

​

**4) 프로바이오틱스**

​

생균인 프로바이오틱스가 풍부한 음식을 먹으면 뇌의 행동에 영향을 미치고, 스트레스, 불안, 우울증을 완화하는 데 도움이 된다는 사실을 밝혀냅니다. 좋은 세균인 프로바이오틱스에 영양을 공급하고 강화하면 세로토닌, 도파민, BDNF 등의 생산, 흡수, 운반을 도와줍니다.

​

셀리악 병, 과민성대장증후군, 크론병 등 소화관에 영향을 미치는 질병에서 우리가 느끼는 몸 상태, 수면의 질, 활력의 수준, 경험하는 통증의 강도, 심지어 생각하는 방식에 까지 영향을 줍니다. 일부 균주가 비만, 염증성 소화관장애, 기능성 소화관장애, 만성통증, 자폐증, 우울증에서 어떤 역할을 하는지 연구가 진행중입니다.

​

케피르, 발효식품, 배양조미료, 생요구르트 등 프로바이오틱스가 풍부한 천연 식품을 통해 섭취하거나, 혹은 젖산균 lactobacillus acidophilus과 비피도 박테리움 락티스 bifidobacterium lactis를 비롯한 다양한 균(적어도 10종)을 제공하고 캡슐당 활성 세균의 수가 적어도 300억마리가 넘는 비유 전자변형 nonGMO보충제를 통해 섭취하는 것이 좋다.

​

**5) 통커피열매농축물 whole coffee fruit concentrate**

​

저자는 이 추가된 성분을 흥미진진하다고 설명합니다. 커피는 커피나무에 열리는 체리 크기의 통통한 붉은 열매 속에 들어 있는 씨앗이다. 커피콩만이 아니라 커피열매까지 통째로 보충제로 만들면 뇌에 좋은 항산화성분이 풍부한 발전소를 얻을 수 있다. 뇌세포를 보호해주는 것으로 알려진 프로사이아니딘 procyanidin이라는 화학물질이 들어 있는 이 추출물은 5장에서 소개했던 BDNF 혈중 수치를 높여주는 폴리페놀 polyphenol도 독특한 구성으로 함유하고 있습니다.

​

실제로 관련연구 <미국 의학협회지> 보스턴 대학연구자는 2,100명 이상 노인을 10년간 추적관찰하였고 그중, 140명이 치매가 발병하였습니다. BDNF가 낮았던 사람에 비해 BDNF가 높았던 사람은 치매 발병위험률이 1/2이하였습니다.

​

통커피열매 농축물을 1회만 복용해도 복용 후 1시간 동안 BDNF의 혈중 수치가 2배로 높아집니다. 이 농충물은 카페인 함량은 낮다고 합니다.

​

**6) 알파리포산 alpha-lipoic acid**

​

이 지방산은 체내 모든 세포속에 들어있으며, 몸의 정상적 기능에 사용할 에너지를 만드는데 필요합니다. 뇌혈관장벽을 통과하여 뇌로 이동하여 뇌속에 물이 많은 조직과 지방이 많은 조직 모두에 강력한 항산화 성분으로 작용합니다. 뇌졸중, 치매 등 자유기 손상과 관련이 있는 다른 뇌 질환의 잠재적 치료법으로 이 성분을 연구하고 있습니다. => 오메가3가 식물성지방으로 있는 것이 alpha-linolenic acid 이고 이것은 alpha-lipoic acid 입니다. 다른 것인지 몰랐네요. ㅜ.ㅜ 또 먹을게 나왔는데 쿠르쿠민과 이것도 고민좀 해야겠습니다.

​

**7) 비타민B 복합체**

​

호모시스테인 수치가 높아지면 치매의 위험도가 높아집니다. 이것을 낮춰주는 것이 비타민B, 특히 비타민B6, 엽산 비타민B12가 수치를 낮출 수 있습니다. 참고로 우울증을 앓는 사람이 비타민 B12 수치가 대단히 낮은 경우, 보충제만으로도 우울증이 완화되는 사례보고도 많습니다. 많은 약물이 비타민B를 억제해서 호모시스테인 수치를 높일 수 있습니다. 특히 호모시스테인 수치가 높은 쪽(혈중 농도 10umol/L이상)에 속한다면 더더욱 권장합니다. => 이미 먹고 있는지라 다행입니다. 비타민B 관련 유전자 돌연변이는 확인안해봐서 나중에 온가족이 검사한번 받아봐야겠습니다.

​

**8) 비타민D**

​

중추신경계에는 비타민D 수용체가 퍼져 있습니다. 비타민D가 신경전달물질의 생산과 신경성장 자극에 관여하는 뇌와 뇌척수액 속 효소의 조절을 돕는다는 것도 알려져 있습니다. 비타민D가 자유기의 해로운 영향으로 뉴런을 보호하고 염증을 줄인다는 것을 말해주고 있습니다. 비타민D 또한 마이크로바이옴과도 관련이 있습니다. 2010년에는 장내세균이 우리의 비타민D 수용체와 상호작용한다는 것을 알아냈다. 장내세균은 이 수용체를 조절해서 활성을 높이거나 낮춥니다. 몇가지 핵심적인 발견 내용을 살펴봅니다.

​

a) 보고에 따르면 비타민D 수치가 높은 사람은 인지기능 저하 위험이 25% 감소합니다. 비타민D가 결핍된 사람은 6년의 추적 기간 동안 인지 기능 저하가 진행될 확률이 60% 높게 나옵니다.

​

b) 2014년 <신경학> 치매가 없는 노인 1,658명을 대상으로 연구한 결과 5년반 후 확인한 결과, 비타민 D 수치가 제일 낮았던 사람들은 알츠하이머병의 위험이 2배 이상 높았습니다. 비타민D 수치가 충분했던 사람에 비해 위험이 53% 정도 높습니다. 연구자들은 ""우리의 연구는 비타민D 결핍이 모든 원인의 치매와 알츠하이머병 위험의 현저한 증가와 연관이 있음을 확인했습니다.""

​

c) 1998년 2006년 사이 성인 858명의 정신 상태를 평가하였습니다. 비타민D 결핍이 있는 사람에게 현저한 정신기능저하를 확인하였습니다.

​

d) 많은 연구에서 비타민D수치 저하와 다발성 경화증 위험을 연관짓는 연구들을 리뷰했습니다. 2명의 캐나다 의사는 이렇게 말했습니다. ""비타민D 보충제는 아주 단순한 치료법이지만 다발경화증 사례의 일부만 예방해준다고해도 비용대비 효율이 대단히 높은 치료법입니다. 하루 용량 4000IU까지는 산모에게도 안전하고, 이용량이면 대부분의 경우 충분한 비타민D 수치에 도달할 수 있으므로 청소년말기에서 성인기까지 두루 사용이 가능합니다. 유아기에 비타민D를 보충해주면 만 7\~9세 여아에서 골량이 더 높아지는 것이 확인됩니다. 적어도 흡연자, 비만자, 다발성경화증의 가족력이 있는 경우 복용하는 것이 좋을것으로 보입니다.""

​

e) 의학 문헌을 보면 비타민D수치는 우울증, 만성피로에 기여한다는 것이 밝혀져 있습니다. 부신이 기분, 스트레스 관리, 활력에서 역할을 담당하는 주요 뇌 호르몬인 도파민, 에피네프린, 노르에피네프린 생산에 필요한 효소의 조절을 도울 수 있으려면 적절한 양의 비타민D가 필요합니다. 경증에서 중증의 우울증이 있는 사람이 보충제만으로도 증상의 호전을 경험하기도 합니다.

​

불충분한 비타민D 수치를 바로잡는 데는 몇달간의 보충제 복용이 필요할 수 있습니다. 인슐린 감수성도 개선됩니다. 냉수성 어류와 버섯 등도 훌륭한 비타민D공급원입니다.

​

**약물 부작용**

​

PPI: 위산억제제

​

역류성 식도염에서 위산억제제는 루틴으로 처방되는 약입니다. 심장질환과 만성신부전의 위험도를 높입니다. 장내세균도 손상시킵니다. **PPI를 7일간만 사용하여도 대장의 미생물의 조성이 변화가 극적으로 보입니다.** 2016년 미국 의학협회에서는 자체 학술지에서 PPI 를 피하면 치매 진행을 예방할 수 있을지도 모른다. 이런 발견은 1차 데이터에서 약물역학적 분석이 뒷받침한다고 발표했습니다. 실제로 생쥐에서 PPI를 복용시키자 치매의 원인 인자 중 하나인 베타아밀로이드 수치를 증가시키는 것으로 보인다고 발표했습니다.

​

**a) 아세타미노펜(타이레놀)**

​

2015년에 나온 오하이오주립대학교 연구에서 타이레놀은 긍정적 감정과 부정적 감정을 모두 무디게 하는 것으로 밝혀졌습니다. **감정의 강도가 약해진다고 합니다. 아세타미노펜은 특히 글루타치온을 고갈**시키는 것으로 알려져 있습니다. 글루타치온은 산화 손상과 몸, 특의 뇌의 염증을 조절하는 데 도움을 줍니다. 2014년 연구에서 UCLA/애리노자대학교 연구자과 공동으로 연구한 **덴마크 연구자들은 임신기간 중 아세타미노펜(타이레놀) 복용한 여성의 아이는 7세 경 ADHD 진단**된 경우가 많다고 발표했습니다.

​

**b) 비스테로이드성 소염제(NSAIDs, 이부프로펜 \~펜, 페\~ 등)**

​

위출혈, 위궤양, 상복부 통증을 일으키는 것은 대부분 알고 있는 부작용이지만 소장까지 손상되는 것은 잘모릅니다. => 닥터 건드리의 \[죽을때까지 \~\] 책에서도 소장 손상을 소장 캡슐로 확인했다고 언급하였습니다.

​

**c) 항생제**

​

장내 유산균을 모두 죽이는 것은 당연합니다. 인슐린 민감성 , 포도당 내성, 지방 축적 등 흔히 이야기하는 당뇨병/비만/대사질환에 모두 관여하는 변화를 장내미생물군 변화로 유도합니다. 탄수화물 대사와 간이 지방과 스테로이드 대사하는 방식도 변경합니다.

1hzdo6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hzdo6i/regrets_and_goodbye/,Regrets and goodbye ,"For the people who cut me off on Halloween night, a few days before my aunt died:

I’m sorry I flipped you off in front of your kids. I’m sorry I was a bitch. I’m sorry I tarnished your night of trick-or-treating with anger and an offensive gesture. The truth is, I wanted you to feel as bad as I did in that moment. I wanted you to feel the pain I was feeling. I wanted you to feel sorry. And that was wrong.

I had just driven 3.5 hours to see one of the most beloved people in my life. To say goodbye. To hold her hand and kiss her forehead as she transitioned from this life to the next. To be there for my mother, who was losing her last nuclear family member far too young.

It was overwhelming. Your family bore the brunt of my anger. My pain.

I still think of you. Your daughter’s face. “We are just trying to go home too,” she said. I flipped you off. You smiled and waved. I know it was petty. I'm sorry. 

All I was trying to do was get to my auntie. To my mother. All you were trying to do was celebrate the holiday.

When I rolled my window down to tell you she was dying, it was the truth. I arrived at her house amidst the festivities to the cold. The dark. The mood was somber and quiet. There was no warmth. Only cold. There were no trick-or-treaters here tonight. Only my auntie lying in the hospice bed. The gentle drone of the nurse’s vintage TV show. My mother’s pain.

I said hello. Kissed my auntie on the forehead. Told her she was rocking the buzzcut and went to sleep.

“Vee, sweetie, I’m sorry to bother you, but her breathing is slowing. You should probably come downstairs.” The words echoed through the night, startling me awake. “Okay, I’m coming down now,” I said, half asleep. I stumbled down the stairs into my mother’s arms, where we spent the rest of the night in and out of consciousness as we watched her breathe. Watching meticulously as her chest rose and fell, not sure if it would be her last. Eventually, rest came—me on the couch and my mom in her bed, lulled to sleep by the whoosh of the oxygen machine.

Alex and Kris arrived the next day. We were happy to be together. Alex and I share a bed willingly for the first time ever in our lives. It must have been because we didn’t want to go through this pain alone. I’ve never seen Alex this sad.

Today, the cousins are coming. I guess they are saying goodbye too. We play our favorite card game, but the entire time, I am again obsessed with the rise and fall of her chest. I don’t want to be playing cards as she takes her last breath.

The mood in the room is somber. Everyone tells her how much they love her. And slowly, our visitors venture out. We sleep again.

The next day is again spent with her. We hold her hand. We tell her how much we love her. We take silly pictures in her wigs. We laugh. I am jealous of my brother. He had such a special relationship with her. I regret telling her I’d never get a nose job, although I sort of knew she had one. And I’m sorry I would say I was coming for the weekend but then leave on Saturday night. It is what it is, and I can’t exactly dwell on it.

I know she loved me. I know she knew I have a tendency to speak my mind. And I know we were extremely close. She loved me uniquely. She loved me whole.

I watch Alex say goodbye, hearts shattering, both his and mine. I feel guilty I am able to stay. I sleep again.

I make eggs this morning. Fried. This time, showing my mom how I’ve perfected my bacon. We hold her hand and sing “Amazing Grace.” Her breathing is slowing now. It has been beautiful, this time with my mom, but also incredibly painful. I’m grateful I’m able to be there for her. We have peace, in spite of the pain. We hold each other close as we screech “It Is Well with My Soul.” I don’t believe in God like I used to. But I feel a divine presence here in this room.

I’m exhausted. How much longer can this last? I’m ready for this to be over. This is not my auntie lying here fighting to breathe. I mean, it is physically, but it is not her soul. Her essence. She was not a skeleton struggling for breath. She was full of life. The very picture of strength. Shielding her loved ones from the reality of her illness. I was in denial about her condition.

Two weeks. Two weeks is all it took for the cancer to consume her body and take her life. We had known for years that the diagnosis was terminal, but it still came as a shock when my mom called to tell me she had officially enrolled in hospice. We had just gone on a family vacation the week prior. And now here we are. Holding her hand. Singing hymns. Praying. Crying.

Eventually, the hospice nurse came. I asked that she change her clothes, as I didn’t want my auntie to be in discomfort. She warned that patients tend to pass when they get jostled around.

At this point, my auntie had the infamous death rattle. A sound like no other, but not dissimilar to a cup of brewing coffee. I knew, from several Google searches, that the end was near.

I looked at her beautiful face as she took another labored breath and said to her nurse, “Be honest. It’s going to be over soon, isn’t it?”

“Oh honey. My brother-in-law was like this for two years!”

I hope not.

I reheated my lasagna and eyed the nurse walk into the corner of the room.

“So. Unfortunately, she did pass.”

A wave of relief rushed over my body. It’s over. Thank God.

I rushed into her room. “Oh my sweet auntie,” I cried as I kissed her forehead. Even still, the main emotion I felt was relief. I said goodbye a long time ago.

We called our family. I comforted Alex. As big of a crybaby as I am, the tears weren’t flowing as I had expected. When the cremation home came, my mother and I loaded her into the stretcher. We gently covered her face and watched as the van took her away for the last time.

We went for dinner that night. The mood surprisingly light. My mom and I each ordered a beer.

Leaving the next day was difficult, but not as difficult as when she was still sick.

I arrived home. Took a breath. And went to work the next day. The grief didn’t fully arrive until weeks later.

Her funeral was beautiful. Everyone spoke of hope. That we might see her again one day. We are Christian, after all. I do have hope, but my heart hurts. I feel her absence immensely. The cavern in my heart is great. I shed tears over her loss every night.

I never thought that I would be here without her. ",2,1736652415.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

At this point I’d settle for stellar conversation that fizzles in a few days, but every so often we come back to each other for a quick hello check in conversation until we don’t. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 
•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to 3 already this year if you include warped tour 4. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. 

FAQ: 
What do I look like? I’m 5’6ish and I’m on the thicker/chubby side. I’m not degrading myself I am describing myself. Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH I’ve include some with and without makeup as well as full body. 

What don’t you like? I don’t like anime or video games. You can but I don’t. I have a huge thing about people trying to peacock and people being critics just to hear themselves talk. 

Whats my schedule like? I work in customer relations M-F and I get up incredibly early and go to bed early. I’m perfect for an east coaster due to this. But also anyone who actually cares about sleep or at the very least my sleep because I stay up for nobody. My day is usually ~4am-8pm during the week. 

What is my type? I’ve quite honestly dated a melting pot of men. I’m attracted typically to style first, kindness second, looks third. But looks still matter in regard to attraction. I’d like l see a picture sooner than later. I don’t have a specific type but mustaches and beards tend to be prevalent in the pool of men I’ll be seeing in hell. 

Can we move off reddit? With time I’m open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I’m not having a Snapstreak with you. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don’t want to put too many perimeters as to what I’m looking for because I’m flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

I didn't want to go because my dad is generally very critical and insulting, but I felt bad and wanted to make sure he was okay. I wanted it to be nice. We had a few glasses of wine, then I poured out some water before bed. He poured another drink which I thought was one of those non-alcoholic herbal ones as I know he drinks those sometimes. It was actually some type of coffee liquor. He began to query my life and ask probing questions like, ""what did I think of myself"" ""am I proud of myself"". I gave level but, stupidly, vulnerable answers. I told him personal thoughts/feelings/reflections in confidence. After these moments of sensitivity, he told me I had amounted to nothing in life, I'm embarrassing and then that I'm a bitch. Every single insecurity played off. For context, I graduated from uni a few years ago and went straight into my career and worked my socks off. It was an incredibly stressful corporate job and I ultimately burnt out and realised I never gave time to my passions. I also developed anorexia. As I had some money saved up I decided to take some time out to follow these passions and recover before returning to work, kind of as a necessity as my mental health had deteriorated so much. My father told me everything I had done during this time was shit, he told me ""why don't you get a job"" as though I'm a lazy bum that cba to work and hadn't dedicated heaps of time to building up expertise in a profession. I reiterate, I'm living off my own savings and planned this time out, I've got a very strong work ethic to the extent I set overly high standards for myself and really struggle to ever ""switch off"". Therefore, his comments pull apart my sense of self. I wish I had never been there for him but my stupid concern for him and worries made me. I know his words will sit in my chest for years as they always do. Echoing around along with ""Get an IQ"" ""You're chubby, no one will love you as you're fat"" etc etc etc. I'll never understand why my dad has always been like this to me and I hate myself for still caring as an adult; it still hurting me, me still being there. I don't know what I'm asking for. I don't really have a question, I'm just distraught. I dreamt of getting away when I was 15, now I'm well into adulthood and I'm still here. I don't know if I'll ever escape the cruelty of my father. I don't know if I'll ever be brave enough to run away as the cage door has been open for years now. Fuck",4,1736651899.0,Vent,5,1.0,False

**Here's another recipe that we posted two years ago, all the way back on Day 263.  Since we have so many new faces and the subreddit has grown, and since this dish is so utterly delicious, we thought it could use a little more spotlight :)**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If you visit Lviv[,](https://imgur.com/a/qCuT3ks) Ukraine you will be thrown into a whirlwind of little coffee shops - probably filled with ornate doilies and fine china - or if it's a newer one - exposed industrial piping with mine carts going by... or even staff walking around with whips ready to jokingly strike BDSM-curious patrons. We wrote about these things in our ""Visiting Lviv"" post you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vevk80/446_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_115th_day_of/).

Regardless of the ambience of the locale, there will be a few things that are constant on every menu - and **Lviv Cheesecake** is one of them. This fantastical dessert is also a staple of any family Sunday brunch to impress visitors or provide the homiest feeling possible - and probably with a cup of coffee from Lviv Coffee Factory “Halka”.

No one knows who invented this divine dish, but I would attribute it to the collective subconscious of people of Ukraine. But it is likely that the codification and popularization of the recipe belongs to the legendary cook Dariia Tsvek.

Dariia, you might call her something of a ""Ukrainian Julia Child"", was born in 1909 in a village in western Ukraine. She became a teacher and led a sort of quiet life. But she also was an avid collector of Ukrainian recipes, which she tested, perfected, and codified and published in her several books. Her biggest success was the bestseller *Sweet Pastries* (often translated as 'Sweet Cookies') which was first published in 1961 and was reprinted nine times. As far as I know there are no English translations, but we will put a link to a PDF of this book in the comments.

Lviv Cheesecake is most often covered in a chocolate ganache. This luxury was possible due to the fact that a chocolate factory was opened in Lviv in 1882 which made access to exotic chocolate for Lvivians much easier, and it became an overnight staple.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Today there are more than 32 relatively common variations of Lviv Cheesecake. It may be prepared with lemon or orange peel, coconut shavings, nuts, poppy seeds and even apples. Yet a few things are non-negotiable: **you simply** ***must*** **use full-fat farmer’s cheese, good butter, and eggs laid by happy hens.**

Lviv Cheesecake tastes as good as it looks, which is unsurprising - however, you may be surprised to learn that making it is really not that difficult.

There are two common types - a kind that is as shown in the image above, only cheese filling with a glaze - and a kind that has dough on the bottom. We will share with you one example from each type, though Dariia herself listed a few versions in her book. **We translated them directly from her book**, and we kept the charming old-school language she used and did not ""modernize"" the recipe much.

We will also link a few modern recipes in the comments. Enjoy!

# How to Make Lviv Cheesecake the Old-School Way

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Version 1: Сирник без тіста (Cheesecake Without Dough)**

**Ingredients**

* Farmers cheese - 1 kg
* Sugar 500 grams
* Eggs - 10
* Butter - 200 grams
* Semolina - 2 table spoons
* Boiled potatoes - 3 or 4
* Diced walnuts - 50 grams
* Vanilla extract - to taste
* Almond extract - to taste

**Recipe**

Separate the egg yolks and egg whites. Mix the egg yolks with sugar. Add melted butter, grind the cheese and grind the potatoes \[Editor's note: at the time, this would have been a meat grinder, a staple of any household\]. Add Vanilla and a few drops of almond extract.

Mix all well so the mixture is fluffy. Then, beat the egg whites until the peaks form. Add the cheese mixture to the egg whites and semolina. Pour it in a cake pan that has been covered with parchment paper. On top, sprinkle the nuts and a little sugar.

Bake in a hot oven - 210 to 220 Celsius for 1 hour. Do not take it out of the pan until the cheesecake is completely cooled off.

\[Editor's note: you can use glossy chocolate ganache for the topping if you really want to impress!\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Version 2: Сирник Апельсиновий (Orange Cheesecake)**

[The cake-on-the-bottom version similar to the recipe below from From Солодке печиво by Дарія Цвєк \(1961\). The version from her recipe does not have chocolate, though :\)](https://preview.redd.it/n2u1mgl69hce1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2910c9cf10787397e0de88b01a2466696cbb38)

  
**Dough (bottom part) Ingredients**

* Flour - 300 grams
* Butter - 250 grams
* Sugar - 1 tablespoon
* Salt - What fits on the end of a kitchen knife

**Cheese Filling Ingredients**

* White farmer’s cheese - 1 kg.
   * \[Editor's note: If you're using cottage cheese or some other wet kind, the water needs to be pressed out)
* Sugar - 300 grams
* Eggs - 8 \[editor's note: room temperature\]
* Semolina - 50 grams
* Raisins - 100 gram
* Almonds - 100 grams (chopped)
* Orange - 1

**Making the Batter for the Cake part:**

Mix the flour with butter cut or shaved into pieces, add sugar and salt and then quickly combine it together knitting it into a tight ball. Leave it to sit in a cold place for 2 hours.

Take the dough, roll it out and place it at the bottom of the cake pan that was previously covered with fat. Poke a few holes with the fork. Bake it for 20 minutes to “half” cook it.

**Making the Cheese Filling:**

Cheese needs to be grinded with a meat grinder or pushed through the sieve. Then “cook” orange by pouring it over 3-4 times with the hot water and letting it sit in it. When it cools off - cut apart, take out the seeds and grind it using the meat grinder. The melted butter needs to be mixed with the sugar. Add the orange, egg yolks and keep mixing, adding one spoon of cheese at a time. Then take the cheese mix, the egg whites \[Editor's note: the egg whites need to be beaten separately first and then folded in, in my opinion\], the raisins and the semolina - mix it all up and pour it into the pan. Then sprinkle the almonds and bake it in the hot oven, 210 - 220 Celsius, for an hour. If cheesecake becomes “too rosy” , cover it with a sheet of wet paper (to prevent burning - my addition). Take out of the pan only when it is cooled off.

This is more or less how the current layout is - the space on the left is meant for an eat-in kitchen. However, we don't need it (have a dining room) and *do* need more storage and counter top space. Not an option to move/knock down the wall. 

Ideas I had:

\-Island instead of the peninsula (didn't seem to work, felt too cramped)

\-fridge and pantry cabinets on the left wall and keep some space by the window (makes fridge too far away)

\-cabinets on the left wall (uppers and lowers) and make a wine or coffee bar, leave some space before window

\-no cabinets on the left wall, find a standalone table and make it a coffee bar or something

\-add a bench on the left wall and then a small table to keep it as an eat-in kitchen (remove barstools)

Thoughts? Ideas?

1hzde38,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1hzde38/visiting_sgi_friends/,Visiting SGI Friends,"Hi, Y'all: 

I've previously mentioned the ladies who live nearby who are longtime members and a couple of 30+ years (spouses since same-sex marriage became legal in the US.) They are nice, and I appreciate that they are real friends and don't mind that I left the org. I've been by occasionally, and BF and I have been over there for dinner. They like him and he likes them, so I hope we can revisit them soon. Today, he had lunch with his veteran friends elsewhere. 

J invited me a few days ago, and mentioned that other members were there. I didn't \*want\* to go because it was a meeting. No, she said, just an informal get-together. But I had something for them and wanted to get it to them, so I went *""fashionably late.""*

Y'all might not know that I've been a sewing fanatic since I was about 13, when I learned how. Long story short, I have collected oodles of fabrics and have scraps I'll use *""one day,""* right? Well. . .a couple of months ago when I was scrolling on Instagram and found [this incredible ottoman, footstool, pouf, whatever you call this thing made from--what?--scraps. ](https://blog.closetcorepatterns.com/fabric-floor-pouf-free-sewing-pattern/)**Where has this BEEN all my life?** I made the first one that weekend. 

You're probably wondering why I'm not posting this on the sewing sub (might do that later.) The reason is that the fabric I used was gifted to me by a WD member who passed away in 2021 (from cancer.) She found out I could sew and figured I'd be the person who would love to have the stuff she was purging. YES! Free fabric! Much was cut pieces, not yardage, but they were big enough to use. She did crafting and upholstery, whereas I focus on fashion, and now, fine lingerie. I sew for myself as a rule, and sometimes make home decor and other crafts. I made a few things out of those fabric pieces including three covers for throw pillows; all I needed was a few zippers.  

When I started searching for the fabric to make the outside, I found the cut pieces she gave me. But a whole BUNCH of fabric samples from a store that made custom furniture were also included. They were JUST big enough to make the exterior pieces. The bottom is two half-moon pieces of denim I had with a long zipper through the middle. And the stuffing is--what?--more fabric scraps, saved from the landfill! If the thing gets a little flat, or you have some towels, jeans, or other textiles you no longer want, just open the zipper, stuff them in, and fill it out. Checks all the boxes for sustainability and eco-friendliness. 

I had enough to make a second pouf and asked them if they wanted it, since the outside fabrics were from our deceased WD. J said they would love it, and it's a great way to keep our friend close. Today I finally got it over there and I ended up explaining it to everyone separately. :) 

I arrived late so that I wouldn't be sucked into the meeting, which was almost done. Well, the members who knew me were quite surprised. One WD who I SWEAR didn't like me said she was glad to see me, no kidding. After the last Zoom meeting I attended I was sure that was the case, but she was quite friendly. 

Later I mentioned that I have no reason to go over to that area where she lives, and she helpfully said that they chant every week at her place. I looked at her and said, *""you do realize that I'm no longer a member, right?""* She said, *""That's OK, we still chant every week.""* I said, *""no, I'm done with all that.""* Nothing more was said about going back. I think my statement caught everyone's attention, but I wasn't going to make a big deal or be rude. 

There were some new faces there--no YOUFF. Two ladies who emigrated to the US from Poland were great fun. The Japanese MD I've known as long as J and his wife were both very nice, too. Our elderly WD friend has been diagnosed with uterine cancer, and it has spread. She is not sure how bad it is, but will not be pursuing treatment. At 82, she feels that she's had a good life. We're going to start paying her more regular visits, I've been meaning to go see her and other stuff got the better of me. 

J made an incredible pecan-encrusted bread pudding that. . .we all had two pieces and coffee, and she gave me the rest to bring home for BF. Back to keto for me. . . .

In the end, it was a good afternoon, nice to see the folks again, and I'm glad I went. But I'm still not going back to the cult. ",1,1736651494.0,sgiwhistleblowers,0,1.0,False

We recently moved to Palmy, and want to start up meetings again here, but we've been looking for cafes that are open on Sunday afternoons; or else some other venue that can provide us with a room for the afternoon. It doesn't have to be a room - even a corner of a cafe would work if it can seat 10-20 people.

I know Focal Point Cinema has a free room available but it only seats 10-12 people, and even without publicising the group, we're already at 9 people so we'll soon outgrow that. Does anyone here know of a free room we could use for that, hopefully with a barista nearby so we can at least show our financial appreciation by buying coffee and cakes all afternoon? Meetings generally go from 2pm to 5pm, venue-allowing.

I am having a terrible time finding places (in person and online) to browse clothes. I’m a size XL and 38. I don’t really mind my proportions, testosterone has done a lot for me, and I’m an average height big ol’ farm boy.

The issue is, I don’t have any male friends, and my husband is 5’1” and 145lbs. I live in the Midwest and buy most of my non-professional clothes at Target or Bomgaars. Most of the local thrift stores are picked over or cater to smaller sizes. I feel like I spend 1-3 hours a week looking for clothes and not finding anything. I have a decent paying job and am open to spending more money on high quality staples, but I’m still trying to figure out what I want and have been losing weight due to lifestyle changes.

I don’t have family money I expect to be passed down. 

If I win I will try to keep it quiet. I will find a way to help my loved ones secretly. 

Day to day: I will live a fairly simple ish life and spend my time and money on things that increase the quality of life, a health forward chef to cook together with, massage therapy, Health coach, a language tutor etc 

Living: I will still rent. A clean safe neighborhood sun drenched rooms with at-least one window facing a tree. Walking distance to a park, library, coffee shop and the post office. I will have nicer quality but still minimal furnishing. I will have a capsule wardrobe. 

Job: I will start a foundation to help educate under privileged girls and set them for success. I will start at the hometown I was born at. I will hire smart and kind people who can do most workload. I will spend no more than 15 hrs a week on work. 

Splurge: I will travel to Mongolia, Japan, Hawaii to begin with. I will spend money on luxury experiences where appropriate but not so much it will hinder me from having an authentic experience.  In Mongolia I will spend days with the nomads in the middle of nowhere. In Japan I will shop stationery in Tokyo, meditate in Kyoto. In Hawaii I will stay at a luxury private beach front resort and eat tropical fruits, read magazines and sunbathe away my winter depression. 

Health: I will find a suitable therapist and schedule bi weekly. I will fix all my teeth which have been bad due to genes and having no healthcare growing up. I will get the best doctor for a surgery I need and hire a private physical therapist for rehab and for as long as I need. 

Money: I will not invest high risk. In fact if I have enough I wont invest at all. I want to not think about money besides the feeling it’s there and it’s enough.

In September I got a really cool and exclusive opportunity to travel to NYC for a work training session. I’m an entrepreneur so not all of my expenses were covered, which kinda sucks but also gives me the freedom to invite whomever I want. I hadn’t been on vacation with my dad (69M) since high school and thought it would be a fun opportunity. Without my knowledge or even consideration he invited my sister to go with us. At first I was a little offended because it was my trip, but it being a work trip there would be several times throughout our stay where I would need to be MIA. Thus leaving my small town sheltered elderly father to roam NYC by himself. To me it made sense so I got over how I felt and accepted she was going. But this made it officially official I was going to NYC. 

Not even 24hours later my sister has phoned everyone in our family to tell them that we’re going to NYC for a family vacation. Totally skipping over the main reason we’re going. When I told my mom (who is divorced from my dad) she interrupted me to say “sis already told me”. Which made me feel like no one cared that I worked hard for a chance to study my skill on 5th Ave in Manhattan. 

Not to mention my over protective dad and her are now insisting to walk me to my training. Sure a touch overboard but really no biggy since it’s a city none of us have been to. Tell me why my sister framed this by saying “We’re going to walk you to the front door like a kindergartner” not just to me personally but has said this to multiple people in front of me. Now is when I feel like she’s infantilizing me. I told both her and my dad I was comfortable walking myself to my training, and they should move forward with their own plans. This however upset both of them horribly, and  made them feel not included in MY opportunity. Yea. 

Thankfully our dad decided to cover most of the cost as an early Christmas present, but I was the one who booked the flights and I booked the Airbnb. I also planned out our days with little to no help from my sister. I was honestly excited to plan our downtime and to do some sightseeing but that was all left up to me as she didn’t want to “overstep boundaries” anymore. I even started a shared notes with her on things I wanted to do and places I wanted to see and her response was “I’m surprised to see some of these attractions because you made it seem like you weren’t interested” huh?? Not interested in seeing the Brooklyn bridge?? I quickly assure her that I wanted her help and input because after all this was now our trip. She outright refused. This to me was really petty and for what? Because I said “hey I’m almost 30 and have this really cool opportunity, will you please stop referring to me as a kindergartener??” I also felt like she was expecting (key word expecting) me to fall on my face. For reference I’m from a suburb in a southern/midwest state. I’ve never lived outside of my state and have done minimal traveling. My sister on the other hand lived in Seattle for 5 years so she considers herself a “seasoned” traveler. 

Fast forward to our trip, all my planning came to be a good thing because her and my dad were totally unprepared. I thankfully had done research on busses and watched walkthroughs on YouTube of how to operate NYC metro/bus stations/taxis. I had a wonderful time, my experience during my training was next level and I left feeling really inspired in my field. I chose to have a good time dispite my sister trying to throw a wrench into things. (I.E. said 2 hours in Central Park was too long iykyk, complained her feet hurt before we were even in New York, and was pretty much uncomfortable everywhere we went.) My father on the other hand had 0 complaints. While annoyed I didn’t let it get to me, I would often check in for water or bathroom breaks and really tried being respectful to my sister and father’s needs. For the most part while we were there the trip went great! I felt like I proved to my dad that I’m self sufficient and can handle traveling alone considering they wouldn’t have gotten anywhere without me. 

Where it went downhill was on our trip home. We got to the airport early and decided to have breakfast near our gate which ended up being amazing! My dad covered our food and my sister covered drinks. (I had 1 mimosa) we both reached for our wallets and she swooshed her hand which I took as “I got this”. We got through our first flight with minimal hiccups but I unfortunately got a touch of altitude sickness. Once we landed and found our gate I b-lined for a Powerade and water. When I got back to our spot my dad said “sis went to a vape friendly spot to stretch her legs, so I said we’d watch her bags” no biggy but I was hungry and spotted a couple restaurants on the way there so I decided I would wait with him until she got back to see if she wanted anything, then I’d venture off to find food. Now looking back I shouldn’t have because she was gone for an hour and a half. Yes I could’ve texted her but I imagined she wanted some alone time and I wanted to respect that. By the time she got back we were lined up ready to board. My dad asked her where she was and she said “oh I decided to get a couple drinks at the bar!” Then goes on to talk about how fun her server was and the lady she met that sat by her. Not going to lie I was a bit salty because why not tell us or invite us over? Maybe I could’ve ordered something there. She could sense our vibe change and promptly asked  “when we get seated, I want to buy us all a round so can I and I’ll send you money later?”  (Sidenote: on most united flights they have you assign a card to each seat for contactless payment. They both got the link to add their own card but didn’t and since mine was the one that was charged initially it auto assigned it to all our seats. I informed them of this and they were both aware that if they bought something on the flight that I’d need them to pay me back). My dad and I didn’t end up ordering any drinks, I still didn’t feel well, she ordered a few. So naturally as sisters do we got into an argument right before we landed. I hate to be those people I know how annoying that is but I was over her negative ass and was ready to not be around her. We land. We go home. 

Several days later I texted her and double checked that it charged my card because  didn’t see the charges yet. She said to wait a few days. Once they came through I Venmo request her for the amount of charged. She fulfills the request, then sends me a novel about how inconsiderate I am and to think of what other people have done for you while on vacation before requesting money because she bought me drinks earlier in the day so she thought we were even. At one point she said “Do your friends a favor and don’t act like this when you go on vacations with them”. I was confused because honestly it was only $20 and our dad bought a lot of our meals and bus tickets. We really only bought souvenirs, coffee, and a taxi’s here and there. I tried explaining that she told me she was buying as we boarded and I honestly thought she was expecting this. I didn’t mean to take her by surprise. I also pointed out that she could’ve called and asked if we could call it even and I would’ve been cool with it but I didn’t like how she paid me then berated me. I called my mom for advice and she said “wait I gave her money to pay you because I thought she would drop it.” Coooooooooool. We take some time to chill. 

A week goes by and we are quickly approaching Thanksgiving. We were celebrating at my mom’s and luckily everything had been going smoothly between my sister and I. While things still felt weird between us we both had put everything aside to spend the holidays together. I prepared thanksgiving dinner as I have for the better part of the last 8 years, and did the dishes after dinner since conversation was flowing and my mom and I were somewhat bonding in the kitchen. When we came back everyone had mostly dispersed aside from my sister and my (39M) brother. My mom and I joined her husband, my boyfriend, and my sister’s boyfriend in the living room watching funny videos on YouTube. My mom’s home is open concept so even though we’re in 2 different rooms my sister is just an earshiot away. I’m talking 5 feet max. I can’t hear everything they’re saying because my brothers back is to me. I could feel tension building so I tried eavesdropping but all I heard is “ehh we’re ok, aside from her shit attitude” ok fair I guess because I did get shitty with her as we were landing. I then hear her say “no you’ll never guess what she did. She-“ I shot her a look that said “are seriously talking shit about me to our brother on thanksgiving?” We made eye contact and she said “what’s up?” I didn’t respond and looked back at my boyfriend and before I could say anything she said “shit she heard me”. That was enough for me, I was lowkey on the verge of tears and just wanted to go home. I looked back at my boyfriend and said “are you ready to go because I’m ready”. We got our stuff and left. 

The next day I called my mom, explained why I left so quick, and told her that I don’t want to be around people that don’t have anything nice to say about me and not to me. I wouldn’t be friends with someone like that so going forward for Christmas I won’t be coming over at the time we all agreed on at thanksgiving. My sister and her bf sleep in, my bf and I are early risers so I decided we would come over for breakfast instead of brunch to open presents Christmas morning and leave before everyone else got there. I thought we could just let things play out that way but my mom decided to warn my sister so it wouldn’t surprise her morning of. (I think this is because we have a small family so it would be abnormal for me not to be there) Naturally this didn’t sit well with my sister so she decided to change her plans to stay the night Christmas Eve to try to sabotage my wishes of avoiding her Christmas morning. Thankfully my parents acknowledge their hand in stirring the pot (intentionally or not) and decided to put their foot down. They told her to go with the original plans since she already agreed this would work. 

The next day my mom and I got a text from my sister “bowing” out of Christmas and cutting us off. My mom for letting me “run the family” and “allowing me to exclude her from Christmas, and dictate who can and cannot come” and me for “being hurtful and inconsiderate”. Honestly I was more relieved than anything. She causes me so much stress and anxiety and for what??? Writing this I’m realizing my family dynamic is obviously so unhealthy. I’m really starting to set some firm boundaries and unfortunately this is just the result. So. 

AITAH? 

TLDR: Sister bought drinks on my card but got mad when I venmo requested her. When I caught her talking shit about me to my brother I excluded myself and came to Christmas at a different time. Sister cut me off and says I’m inconsiderate and controlling the family. AITAH. ",4,1736651141.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

The notes are pretty basic, with Bergamot, Coffee and Vetiver. This was more of a blind buy on my part. Every time I've been into a place to smell it, they never had it as a tester, and I've been a fan of most other Valentino scents.

I am in love with this scent, it seems to go in a much different direction than any of the other scents in this line in my opinion. It comes across as very masculine to me, I enjoy the way that the scent interacts with my skin chemistry.  The longevity could definitely be better, as it fades to a skin scent pretty quickly. A respray is necessary to try and get through a work day with it.

What are some of your thoughts on this cologne that have smelled it?

I was lucky enough to live on St Marks Place in 1992-93, a short walk down the street from Sin-é. I walked in one Monday night for a coffee and heard a singer performing who blew me away. Turned out to be Jeff, and I became a regular at his gigs. 

There was an elderly homeless black man in the neighborhood everyone called Tree Man because he would walk around with tree branches sticking out of the back of his shirt. One night while Jeff was performing, Tree Man walked into Sin-é and started going from table to table asking for change. Sin-é was too small for this not to be disruptive, and sure enough Jeff stopped mid-song. 

We were expecting Jeff to be annoyed, but something magical happened. Jeff started talking to Tree Man in a friendly way and was asking him questions. Jeff asked him where he was from, and Tree Man said Mississippi. Jeff asked him if he knew any Mississippi blues, and Tree Man said yes. Jeff asked if he wanted to sing something, and Tree Man agreed. Tree Man walked to the mic, and Jeff chatted with him quietly for a few seconds as they decided on a song. Then Jeff started playing (I wish I could remember the song), and Tree Man started singing. It was beautiful. Tree Man had a great voice, and he gave an authentic performance of a sad song. 

When he finished, the place exploded in applause. Jeff passed his tip bucket for people to donate and asked the waitress to bring Tree Man a sandwich. Jeff handed Tree Man the sandwich and all the money in his tip bucket, and Tree Man walked out into the night muttering to himself. It was beautiful.

While I can/and do bring up the red flags in men she likes, it seems like none of it really matters or makes a difference, because she has made up an idealized version of the men she's interested in.

So far it was mostly just immature and selfish guys our age, but currently it has taken on a whole new dimension.

She had a crush on a mental health counselor (42m) at an open clinic for youth. (For context she was already 18 at that point)
She confessed and he didn't say yes/no, but as soon as she was done with her treatment he immediately invited her out for coffee. Long story short, 3 or so dates in, they had sex and began a relationship...

With him saying things like:
""I keep thinking about our situation and I can't eat or sleep...""

""For me...It's not about age, but rather about maturity...""
(When she asked him if he has an issue with her being 18.)

When i asked him if he'd still date her if she was 17, since she had turned 18 around a month or two after going into the clinic. He just said:""Well, she isn't,  so?""

From my perception he talks to her like someone would talk to a child, at least in the phone call I had with both of them...

When she gave me his number I had a chat with him and he'd consistently bring up random topics and buzzwords in the wrong context, and I can entirely admit that maybe that just a thing I personally don't like. I don't like it when people use big words, or bring up topics like Buddhism and Quantum Physics with false information... (Yes it's just as random as it sounds). I, myself am autistic and also kind of get this visceral urge to correct any misinformation that is stated as fact, so I did that a couple times in the nicest way I knew how.
After the convo he immediately went to my best friend and called me stubborn and unempathetic. Which I can understand the second part of since the way I talk/text can come across as more clinical, the second part I really don't quite know why he said/felt that way.

She also told me that he'd get offended if she would ask him if he would consider going into therapy.

He also used the n-word to refer to black people. She called him out for it and he said it's ok, because everyone says it.
For more context, no, where we live even my conservative upper/middle class grandparents don't use it, despite them being very racist.
He also later said he was ""just quoting"", and later on said ""Banning words isn't going to help racism"". He also was confused why this is important to her since she and none of her close friends are black.

When my friend brought up feminist issues he immediately rebutted with: But what about men?

She also said she feels emotionally bad after having intercourse, but that it's fine when he hugs her...

She describes him as sensitive and easily offended and defensive, even though once again SHE is 18 and HE is 42.

He also doesn't have any close friends. The only friends he mentioned to her were his friends from school (when he was in school as a minor) and that they just live far away.

He also told her not to talk about anything regarding him to other people, not even her close friends, because we shouldn't judge him, without him present.

I just don't know what to do, and I'm sure I forgot a bunch of red flags, but she just doesn't seem to care even though everyone around her sees how 'problematic' this is....

1hzd4sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1hzd4sp/is_he_scarred_or_just_not_that_into_me/,"Is he scarred, or just not that into me? ","My partner and I have been together for 14 months. To give some history we were together 20 years ago when we were in high school, he was my fist love, the one I lost my virginity to, we were inseparable. We were 100% each others person, we were together for about 3 years and then broke up but stayed friends for a couple of years. Then we stopped speaking and went our separate ways and had new relationships. He got married and raised step children and had one of his own and I also had 2 children although I never married. Fast forward 17 years and we got in touch via Facebook, he was separated and so was I. We went for coffee and then kept seeing each other. It was amazing, we clicked so well it was like no time had passed. My last relationship was abusive and he was very supportive and patient with me. After about 6 weeks he stated that our situationship felt more like a relationship and I agreed and so we became official in a relationship. About a month after that his divorce was finalised. He gets on with his ex partner and they have a good set up with sharing their son. 
So everything was/is great. We have a lot of fun together, he’s very routined and consistent so he always comes over the same 2 nights per week, he is affectionate and playful, he’s lovely to my kids. We’ve had times away and date days which are great so the basis of us is really brilliant and healthy. 
The reason I’m here is that there seems to be an issue with anything deeper. For example he hasn’t said I love you, I have written it and said it, he has finally written it back but only when asked rather than him freely saying it. He doesn’t share anything on social media and he always said he just doesn’t do that, but then I was looking for a photo and when I scrolled back there was loads of posts about his wife from when they were together. I fell down a rabbit hole of looking and they were so loving, he would write about how proud he is of her, or how much he loves her, and how she made him the best version of himself. There were lots of loving posts. I know it’s only a snap shot into the relationship but it hurt that there hasn’t been a single post of me and him, it also hurts that he doesn’t even privately say these things or similar things to me. He does reassure me that he’s not going anywhere and his actions show that he really likes me but I don’t know if he loves me. I worry his divorce was rushed and he regrets it. I worry that he’s still in love with her. He has said love is a big word and people just throw it around but surely it wouldn’t be a big deal to say if he really felt it and really loved me.
I have tried to talk to him, I said I had seen the posts and totally understand that he’d write loving things because she was his wife and he would have loved her but I’m worried I won’t measure up because the person he was then is not the person I see. He didnt say a word, he just sat there looking down. He’s not great at talking so I usually have to try and text about it but i really hoped he would say something reassuring and he literally didn’t say a word. 
I can’t work out if he’s emotionally scarred from his divorce so is playing things very slow and very careful on the emotional
front, or if he’s still in love with his ex wife. He has told me that they would have split years before if it wasn’t for their son,  but the loving posts don’t reflect that. He’s a closed book so I’ve never had much to go on, I think that’s why seeing the posts have been a bit of a shock. 
I’m 38 and I want to build a life, I want to live together (although we’re happy to wait for a few more years) I want to get married one day (I don’t think he does) I can forgo the marriage if there’s some other level of commitment but ultimately I want to know where his heads at and I know only he can tell me so what do I do? How do I get him to open up and talk to me? I have been very open about my past and all the crap it came with, so it’s not like it would be one sided. I think it hurts more because years ago he would tell me anything, I was his go to person and now he seems so emotionally closed off, I just want him to let me in.

Me and my wife are really tired of Maryland. 
We’re from Baltimore and live in a county outside of the city. 
There’s just too many people. I know this is everywhere. But it’s too congested. 
This isn’t an immediate decision, but we’d like to plan. 
We like how close things are but it’s a hassle to go anywhere. 
Big on nature and outdoor activities and outdoor sports. 
Would like to be “close” to convenient things like stores and businesses. But not in the hustle and bustle of it all. 
More interested in northern areas. 
Not political at all, would love areas that aren’t super focused on politics.  
Not religious at all either but we can get along with mostly anyone. 
Bars don’t matter to us, but cool coffee spots/restaurants are awesome. 
Many of the places we think about have no available work or all farm work. We’re no strangers to that, and we know cities are where work is. 
Something outside of a city that isn’t like California or New York expensive would be great. 

I know this is vague, but we want slower lives. 
We don’t have kids and don’t plan to. 
Really just reaching out to see where others have gone and had similar experience ",4,1736650396.0,SameGrassButGreener,19,0.83,False

My fiance works so he's gone most of the day. The thing with buying a house and cosharing a space with my mom is also cosharing a space with my grandma who does not like me...i know she doesn't because she does (or doesn't) do little things she does for my siblings who don't live in our house. She'll go out of her way to cook food for both of my siblings and pack them their lunches for work / go clean their house. When they're sick, she takes care of them. I've been sick ONCE (ended up in the ER) in the past year and she said i had to deal with it for the sake of being present for my baby. I didn't ask or expect anything from her but maybe a little help with my baby while i threw up every 20 minutes would've been nice. 
Anyway! 
She does not respect one single thing I ask of her not to do with my baby. I have caught her giving my 11 mo. old coffee, she's telling my baby to say bad words, she does this weird thing where she sucks my babies fingers for fun? I told her to stop all of that and she'll just laugh at me and call me sensitive. I've tried to be nice about it but today I told her I'm my daughters mother and she has to respect what I want for my baby, period. She just laughed at my face and mocked me then walked away. 
I can leave, but this is my house. I can't kick her out bc she's old and she's like a package that comes with my mom. 
I have asked my mom to speak to her but all she says is ""she's old. just ignore her"" but my grandma keeps doing/teaching/giving things to my baby that i don't agree with. 
How else can I tell her to stop!?",4,1736650383.0,family,9,1.0,False
1hzczrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1hzczrh/overly_attached_coworker_or_am_being_mean/,Overly Attached Coworker or am being mean ? ,"I (25F) started at this company about two years where I met a coworker (37F) and we share half our clients together so we had to work together frequently. When we first met I was very friendly bc I had no reason not to be (and I knew we’d be working together a lot) and wanted to have a good relationship with her because she was very knowledgeable and helpful. She invited me out to lunch and wanted to get to know me. We shared a few things in common like interest in books, baking, and crafts. She very quickly started wanting to meet together often and work on all our projects together, although it wasn’t necessary. This kind of bothered me at first since she was very pushy about it and I preferred working alone. She started to invite me and other coworkers out to social events. the first time we hung out outside of work, she talked about not having many friends. At dinner she shared that she tried to end her life about 10 months ago, and that she was in an extremely unhappy  marriage. I was kinda surprised she was so open with everyone since we had really just met. I felt very sorry for her. As the night went on she shared more and more details to me about her unhappy marriage and her lack of friendships. After this she became very clingy to me. She wanted to hangout socially every chance she got, she wanted to go on trips with me, she wanted me to meet her kids and insisted I come over to her house to work all the time. I didn’t always say yes bc I’m the kind of person who takes a while to become close with someone. And when we did hangout all she talked about was her husband and his lack of any interest in their marriage. I have a very happy marriage with my husband and she always seemed jealous of it, and made me feel like I could never talk about it with her. She also made weird comments like she was the girl version of my husband. They have some similar interest but she is not like him at all btw. One time while hanging out at a bar I made a simple comment on how me and my husband agreed on the idea of in the future fostering children and she started to cry and said “when I grow up I want to have a relationship like you guys do” this made me really uncomfortable. She also started sending me reels on Instagram stating I’m the most important person in her life and she doesn’t know what she’d do without me. As I got to know her more I realized the more and more we really don’t have in common. We are very different types of people. I didn’t know what to do since she depended on me so much. She shared very very deep and dark secrets with me randomly and I didn’t know what to say. She does see a therapist and I told her to talk to her about these things and she did and her therapist would tell her similar things I did. She also started coming to my house and bringing her kids while we were supposed to be working, which annoyed me bc then I spent the time basically catering to her kids. She would buy me gifts all the time and go extremely out of her way for me, which I felt bad about. There have been a lot of incidents of her doing things like this throughout my time working with her. I honestly felt like she would start stalking me or something. I personally never felt that close to her and felt like she didn’t know me as a person at all. Our difference in age felt very noticeable and I felt like she couldn’t really relate to me and never felt like I could talk about my life bc she’d become upset with her life. I am also not someone who needs to be with my friends all the time like her. I like staying home with my husband bc we are great friends. I recently left this job because of her and she said she spent weeks crying after I told her I was leaving. She said we’d have to meet weekly for coffee dates, mind you I don’t even do this with my closest friends or family! She also said she was terrified of never seeing me again. I feel bad about that because since I quit I haven’t seen her. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to be her friend and feeling uncomfortable? I don’t know how to move forward bc she continues to text me, I don’t always reply and I feel bad about it. Am I terrible for not wanting to be her friend?

1hzcy7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1hzcy7z/31f4mcaliforniaanywhere_a_connection_a_feeling_a/,"31[F4M]California/Anywhere - A connection, a feeling, a conversation…","Good morning/day/afternoon/evening! (That should cover my greeting bases) I’m Kristen, I’m 31 and I’m here for a good time, probably not a long time, but who knows. I’m throwing out a wide net to find a connection, a friendship or a conversation that makes me feel something. Anything. Just a glimmer of hope a twinge of excitement. At this point I’d settle for stellar conversation that fizzles in a few days, but every so often we come back to each other for a quick hello check in conversation until we don’t. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 
•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to 3 already this year if you include warped tour 4. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. 

FAQ: 
What do I look like? I’m 5’6ish and I’m on the thicker/chubby side. I’m not degrading myself I am describing myself. Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH I’ve include some with and without makeup as well as full body. 

What don’t you like? I don’t like anime or video games. You can but I don’t. I have a huge thing about people trying to peacock and people being critics just to hear themselves talk. 

Whats my schedule like? I work in customer relations M-F and I get up incredibly early and go to bed early. I’m perfect for an east coaster due to this. But also anyone who actually cares about sleep or at the very least my sleep because I stay up for nobody. My day is usually ~4am-8pm during the week. 

What is my type? I’ve quite honestly dated a melting pot of men. I’m attracted typically to style first, kindness second, looks third. But looks still matter in regard to attraction. I’d like l see a picture sooner than later. I don’t have a specific type but mustaches and beards tend to be prevalent in the pool of men I’ll be seeing in hell. 

Can we move off reddit? With time I’m open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I’m not having a Snapstreak with you. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don’t want to put too many perimeters as to what I’m looking for because I’m flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

Mom (gently): Riley…	Riley…	Riley, time for school

Riley (moaning): Ughhhhhh

*Riley woke up with a boiling head. She wakes up uncharacteristically slow and paced. Mom is used to seeing Riley waking up full of energy.*

Mom: Honey, are you alright? 

Riley (moaning): Ughhhhhh

*Mom places her hand on Riley’s forehead, feeling the heat on her forehead*

Mom: You’re burning up! I’ll get the thermometer

*Mom walks down the hall. Zoom into Mom’s mind*

Mom’s Fear: This can’t be chicken pox!? She’s only 6!

Mom’s Joy: She caught it when she was 3. It only happens once.

Mom’s Disgust: Are we staying or is Bill gonna deal with her?! 

Mom’s Anger: I’ll tell you one thing that’s for sure: I am NOT cleaning up more snot. If she’s gonna make a mess, SHE’S gonna clean it.

Mom’s Sadness: Now where did we put the thermometer?!

*Mom reaches the right bin*

Mom’s Disgust: No! NO! NO! It was in the left bin! 

Mom’s Anger: NO the other left! NEXT to the peptobismol and cough syrup.

*Mom hears Riley cough. She finds the Infrared thermometer and the cough infers her to get the cough syrup, too. Mom rushes back to Riley’s room.*

Mom: Honey?

As Riley sneezes and the pain washes over her, the camera zooms into Headquarters. Inside, everything is in chaos—lights flashing red, the temperature gauge on the wall spiking into the ""Too Hot"" zone.

**Disgust**: (fanning herself dramatically) *WHY?!?? IS??? IT… SO… HOT… IN HERE???*

**Joy**: (wiping her forehead, trying to stay cheerful) Oh, come on. It can’t be that hoo… (pauses as she suddenly feels the heat) Oh boy. Yep. You’re right.

**Disgust**: (sarcastic, gesturing at her dress) What are we going to do, Joy? This dress is *not* made to sweat in. Do you know how long it takes to steam wrinkles out of this?

**Fear**: (panicking as he checks the dials) Oh no, oh no, oh no! We’re completely fried! What if we stay like this forever?!

**Anger**: (marching over to the control panel) Forget it! I’ll FIX the temperature with my *bare hands*! (slams a fist on the console, causing a small spark) There! Problem solved! ... Wait. WHAT THE? Why isn’t it working?!

**Joy**: (stepping in front of Anger, waving her arms) Okay, okay, everyone CALM DOWN! We just need to work together and figure this out.

**Sadness**: (sighing, holding a tissue) What’s the point? Riley feels awful. (sniffles) We should just sit here and let her cry.

**Joy**: (spinning around, exasperated) Sadness! No crying! That’ll only make her feel worse. Remember what happened last time? (points to a memory orb of Riley sobbing after scraping her knee)

**Fear**: (eyes wide) She couldn’t breathe for, like, *five minutes*! We can’t handle that again!

**Disgust**: (rolling her eyes, crossing her arms) Ugh, great, so we’re overheating *and* we have to keep it together? This day just keeps getting better. 

**Joy**: (turning back to the group with a determined smile) Look I know this is new, but we’ve been through worse. Remember her first day of school? (she points to a glowing memory orb of Riley smiling at her desk) We can do this!

**Sadness**: (looking at the orb, perking up slightly) Yeah… I mean, it wasn’t so bad once she made it through lunch.

**Anger**: (grumbling) I still don’t see how eating carrot sticks counts as a victory.

**Disgust**: (shrugs) Well, at least it wasn’t the cafeteria mystery meat.

**Joy**: (clapping her hands, rallying the group) See? We’ve got this! Riley’s sick, but Mom’s here to take care of her. We just have to keep her calm and comfy. Agreed?

(The group exchanges reluctant glances before nodding. Joy steps up to the controls with a small smile, but she hesitates, glancing over her shoulder.)

**Joy**: (nervously) ...Does anyone know how to make being sick fun?

**Sadness**: (gently placing a hand on Joy’s shoulder) Maybe it’s not about making it fun. Maybe we just need to help her get through it.

**Joy**: Alrighty! 

***Zoom out to Riley and Mom.***

*Mom crouches next to Riley, brushing a stray hair from her face.*

***Mom****: Riley, where are you feeling pain?****Riley****: (sniffling heavily) My tummy hurts and my head hurts and… and… Mr. Nose is… (sniffles loudly) soooo stuffy!*

*Mom tries to stifle a chuckle at the nickname “Mr. Nose” and gently presses a tissue into Riley’s hand.*

***Mom****: (calmly) Do you think you’re well enough to go to school? Or maybe… you should just stay home today?*

*Riley’s face lights up faintly, despite her flushed cheeks. Her body sags into the couch in a way that screams “please let me stay.”*

***Zoom into Riley’s mind:***

*Joy bursts into action, bouncing from one end of Headquarters to the other like a firework. She’s holding confetti in her hands, which she throws into the air, spinning and cheering.*

***Joy****: NO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!! No school! No school! No school! No school! No school!*

*She flips across the room like a gymnast, grabbing the microphone on the console and shouting:*

***Joy****: What do we do first?! I’ve got it! We’ll start by watching TV… then play on Dad’s computer… and THEN… (gasps dramatically) play with Bing Bong in the garden!*

*She pauses for a moment, tapping her chin thoughtfully.*

***Joy****: SCRATCH THAT! Ohhh, even better idea! POOL PARTY WITH BING BONG AND MERMAID UNICORN!!!*

*Disgust looks up from the corner where she’s been halfheartedly flipping through a magazine, raising one eyebrow.*

***Disgust****: (dryly) Because nothing says “being sick” like cannonballing into a pool while coughing up your lungs. Classy, Joy.*

*Fear, meanwhile, is pacing frantically in a circle, clutching his clipboard.*

***Fear****: Wait, wait, wait—what if Dad doesn’t let us do any of that? What if he makes us stay in bed all day with no TV?!*

*Joy skids to a halt in front of Fear, placing her hands on his trembling shoulders.*

***Joy****: (reassuring) Relax, Fear. It’s Dad. He always lets us bend the rules when Mom’s not home. Remember the time we had waffles for dinner?*

*Fear stops pacing, momentarily distracted by the memory.*

***Fear****: (tilting his head) That… was pretty awesome.*

***Anger****: (pounding his fist on the console) And we can FINALLY get rid of the monster! I’m telling you, he’s been creeping out of that closet every night like he owns the place.*

***Disgust****: (wrinkling her nose) Ugh, and he smells like dirty socks dipped in old milk. Someone has to do something about that.*

***Joy****: (brightly) Okay, okay, let’s add that to the list: TV, pool party, waffles, and monster vanquishing. Sound good?*

*The emotions exchange nods, rallying behind Joy’s plan.*

***Zoom back out to Riley’s parents:***

*Mom stands near the door, pulling on her coat as she glances back at Dad, who’s holding a mug of coffee and looking way too relaxed about the day ahead.*

***Mom****: (pointing a finger at him) Okay, I’ve just called the school to let them know Riley’s absent. You sure you can handle her on your own today?*

*Dad flashes a confident grin, leaning against the kitchen counter.*

***Dad****: (casually) We’ll be fine, honey.*

*Mom narrows her eyes slightly, unconvinced, but then checks her watch and sighs.*

***Mom****: (grabbing her bag) Oh, gotta run. LOVE YOU!*

*She blows a kiss and heads out the door, leaving Dad alone with Riley.*

***Zoom into Dad’s mind:***

***Dad’s Joy****: (stretching lazily) Alright, team, looks like we’ve got this under control. One sick kid, one day at home… no problem.*

*Dad’s Disgust groans, setting down his donut.*

***Dad’s Disgust****: Thanks for the image, Fear.* 

***Dad’s Sadness****: (frowning) Poor kid… I hate seeing her like this. Remember when she had that bad dream about the clown? She looked so scared…*

*The room goes quiet for a moment, the emotions all reflecting on Riley as a little girl. Finally, Dad’s Joy sits up and claps his hands together.*

***Dad’s Joy****: Alright, let’s not overthink this. Step one: Keep Riley comfy. Step two: Keep Riley entertained. Step three: Avoid a meltdown. Easy peasy.*

*He leans back again with a self-satisfied grin as Dad takes a long sip of coffee in the real world.*

***Zoom out to Riley and Dad:***

*Dad steps into the living room, where Riley is curled up on the couch with her favorite blanket.*

***Dad****: Alright, kiddo. What do you want to do first? TV? Board games?*

*Riley sniffles, her big eyes peeking over the edge of the blanket.*

***Riley****: Can we… have waffles?*

The seller instructed me to do things like drinking black coffee, eating pineapple and unripe papaya, inserting primrose vaginally and taking it orally, and drinking beer consecutively.

I felt really hesitant about those preparations.

Returning player here. Returned to the game in the Christmas week. Managed to get some levels (192 to 370) and some gear. However I'm not sure what I should do or get now to improve the character, especially on the gold bullion vendor. I run a unarmed/autoaxe build, and my gear is the following:

Usual stuff: shock gauntlet with Vamp/SS/STR/Fencer

Bosses: Poison auto axe with Vamp/PA/STR/Viper. Not using pounder yet cause it's expensive.

Armors: complete thorn armor set, all with overeater/STR/Arms Keeper/Bruiser.

Character def is around 500-700 with perks, can't remember now. Not focusing on rad resistance because I'll become a ghoul when it comes and I have a crapton of radaway to places where rad is high.

Legendary perks: STR, agi, luk. 
Will max legendary int/taking one for the team as soon as I reach 150 on the score board. Last legendary slot is with legendary endurance for the lack of better options.

Things I bought with gold bullion already are:
Thorn armor set

Gauntlet

Weight bench

Chemist backpack mod

Radstag food farm camp item

Company tea

Coffee machine (atom shop actually)


With the exception of raids and nuke bosses, all content in the game can be done solo.

What should i aim for now? I was thinking about the cryo freezer but it doesn't seem that useful because of the thru hiker and good with Sault perks, makes food weight nothing and almost never spoil. Is there a very good item for gold bullion that I'm missing currently?

1hzcsbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1hzcsbm/experiances_with_exemptions_for_rto/,Experiances with exemptions for RTO? ,"Throwaway because I know my coworkers are on here and trying to give enough detail to add context to my questions. 

Company I'm at (Tech/Engineering) announced RTO 5 days starting in June ""with exemptions being case by case"" and that ""granting remote exceptions will be rare"". 

Prior to the announcement my manager pulled me into a huddle with my 2nd line and told me it was coming but my performance is good and I could continue hybrid. Had a unrelated call with my third line after the announcement and he reiterated that I was exempt, just keep doing what I'm doing. I've heard a few other what I'd consider ""good"" employees mention they had similar chats with their 1st lines -- making me think they're trying to reduce headcount but by giving these exceptions so the key people stay. 

Our CEO is openly very anti WFH and reluctantly let it happen for covid because it was that or no work. After covid he only allowed hybrid because the rest of the industry was and it became a huge recruiting tool, productivity went up, our stock took off. Super easy for management to track who is working and performing based on job type and output (engineering on remote servers with user activity logging built in). Now that a couple big players in our industry (mainly AWS) are pushing RTO he's all about it again and apparently drawing a line in the sand. Prior to covid my group was an acquisition for the company and had been doing hybrid since around 2010 or so and when we were acquired no one said anything about continuing it or not and no one forced us to do 5 days a week even though the parent company did. We have multiple sites and people WFH when they or their kids are sick so even with 5 days RTO zoom hybrid meetings will still be needed to function. 

CEO briefly mentioned in his last few calls frustration with non-compliance for current hybrid policy of three days in but stopped short of demanding it -- just they've been looking at badging and it's been very low for all sites. Most people (including managers) at my site do what we did prior to covid: 2 days in office for group work, team lunches and meetings and leave the other three for primarily focused individual execution and small project meetings. Some people coffee badge and a few people have gone full remote but neither of those are very common. Our stock has been going bananas last couple years (and still is) because we've been crushing customer execution targets so lower and mid management has been letting what works for people go as long as the work gets done and the numbers stay up.  Sounds like that's coming to an end for most of us even though 2024 was by far the best year we've ever had and a decent LTR forecast going into 2025.

So I have a verbal exemption to keep doing what works for me now but because the CEO is so opposed to WFH and hybrid I'm skeptical of how sanctioned my exception is although I know my 1st, 2nd and 3rd lines are ok with it (CEO is my 4th line) as long as the work stays consistent. The wording of his announcement seemed to highlight full remote more than hybrid. I've also heard of a bunch of people getting exemptions so I'm not sure if that's ""rare"" enough for our CEO. 

Just got a performance bonus for working above and beyond to help a customer out, have been told numbers look good likely getting a promotion this cycle. I really like my job, they seemingly like me in return, and my 1st and 2nd lines are the best managers I've ever had. In an ideal world I'd stay put. However, given the opposition to WFH at the top I'm wondering if I'm putting too much stock in past performance value to the company and if I'd be foolish to waste this next 5 months assuming my exemption is going to hold up or I should start putting irons in the fire now. 

Mid career specialized engineer so hard but not impossible to replace me but also harder for me to quickly find a comparable job especially with the tightening of remote positions industry wide. Engineering jobs have been fleeing my state so not a lot of options left up here so a move to a new company and hybrid would likely involve uprooting and moving. 

Reality is I can't go to 5 days and core hours with a 1-2hr commute each way and make daycare pickup time and can't gamble on getting fired for insubordination because I'm the primary breadwinner and I've got mouths to feed at home and a home I'd like to keep. Took this job a decade ago for the flexibility. Get to actually see my kids  during the week and took a lot of evening stress off my wife having me there vs me commuting full time and walking in at or after dinner most nights. 

Has anyone had experience with performance based exemptions to RTO like this and how did it go 6mo to a year or two in? 

Did you get anything in writing? 

Was it pushed from the top or were your immediate/middle managers pushing for it? 

Did high performers get to stay remote or eventually called in? 

Did those that had to go in start to resent you and start cutting you out of key conversations or did it become highlighted  in employee surveys or similar and put pressure for everyone to be back? 

I've seen on the news tech companies forcing RTO but wondering how many have exemptions like this in place and how well it's held up or if all the CEOs are just waiting to see what the others do.  ",3,1736649496.0,remotework,3,0.8,False

When I turned 40, I experienced my first ocular migraine, which was scary AF but kinda trippy. 

In December, I woke up with a headache (I do have OSA and wear a CPAP religiously). I went to work that day, and the headache continued to progressively worsen. I had not had caffeine that morning, so I chalked it up to caffeine withdrawal. By that afternoon, the pain and pressure were almost unbearable, so I got a coffee, thinking that would relieve it. Within 15 minutes, I was vomiting and I was having the worst headache of my life. 

Last night, the same thing happened. I was at work and developed a severe headache; after a few hours, I was violently ill. I had to call in to work today because I was still vomiting this morning. I still have the headache—it has varied in its intensity, but it has not gone away. I tried Excedrin Migraine, but it hasn’t helped much. I can feel the pressure building up in my head, and I’m afraid I’m going to start vomiting again. 

What’s worse is that I’ve had to call in for sick days, and I am on the path to disciplinary action due to calling in; even leaving work early due to illness is a strike against me.

Automated coffee makers and smart ovens also provide convenience by allowing users to control them remotely, providing the ultimate in culinary innovation.

- **Blenders:** Essential for smoothies and sauces, high-powered blenders can crush ice and blend even the toughest ingredients with ease.
- **Spiralizers:** These handy tools transform vegetables like zucchini into healthy ""noodles,"" perfect for low-carb dishes.
- **Mandolines:** For evenly sliced fruits and vegetables, a mandoline is a must-have, offering precision and speed in the kitchen.
- **Food Processors:** Ideal for chopping, slicing, and mixing, a good food processor can significantly cut down preparation time.

On the dramatic side of it (justified at the time, rejection after rejection) I asked myself most weeks, will I ever work in my field again. Not news here but it's a terrible terrible market and has been for years. On the lighter side I found myself whether delusional of not, telling family and friends when they enquired how I was going - that I'm just going through the motions and tackling one day at a time, rolling with the punches, as they were punches one after the next after the next. 

I wanted to post this as a reminder to those that are finding it really tough at the moment and to those that are losing and have lost faith to try and stay above water, the darkness and hopelessness will come to pass. 

These are my take aways from my own journey, much of it would have been posted before but I hope some of it helps / resonates and ultimately I want to say we feel the pain you do and hopelessness that you're going through. 

You aren't alone - this is a beautiful community and I have found much solace in reddit over the last year+ for providing light hearted perspectives as well as particularly this sub that the world is very fucked and from the sub perspective/s, there are many horror stories, some hilarious, others atrocious. 

Some of these lessons are obvious, some may need reminding:

***** Market / Realities / Money *****

1 - this job market is truly fucked (it's not you, it's global, every market) you are not alone. 

2 - if you spend all day every day thinking about how bad it is and your lack of role it will crush you, you have to take a break so you don't overwhelm yourself because it is very hard otherwise. I've gone through bouts of depression, it is normal but don't sit in it for too long. Get out and get some fresh air or sunshine (VD) or even see a mate, break up the darkness in any way you can so it's not constant. Being out among people, even sitting in a cafe or in a park does help. 

3 - if you can, get a part time job, hospitality is a good and honest industry (I went back to making coffee). Whilst it's not related to my formal qualifications, it has given me some walking around money and you're around people - this was probably the single biggest thing that kept me above water mentally for my year of hell. Breaking up your corp applications (if applicable) with some other maybe non related work helps you take your mind of the endless self worth internal thought track and puts some space between the mental gymnastics of actually doing an application and working. 

   There are many people who think just because they went to university and got a degree in x means they never again have to drop back into a services industry or work that shit dead end job to make ends meet, should times get tough. Do what you need to do to get by and fuck anyone that looks down on you or judges you for this, I dealt with this bullshit from folks within my friendship group and community and I don't have time for those people anymore, kicking me when I'm down was brutal and it really fucking hurt, that speaks to their character, not mine. For me the industry I fell back to was hospitality, for you it could be something else. It was one of the first things I did at the start of my now 14 month search which  I complimented with attempted consistent applications (not always successful but I tried). 

   The people that think this approach is beneath them are the ones that fall the hardest should their turn ever come and they're down and out, no this was not ideal but if you have the ability to walk and carry things or even another skill in a seperate industry - use these skills. Many people just can't face up to it but I needed money and my family came first, so I put my ego aside. I realise securing this other job is not a given and I'm grateful that I couls, I take nothing for granted anymore. You have to fight for everything. 

   Through this job I developed a few really nice friendships and as someone in their thirties, the older you get the harder it is to make friends (reality). This was a nice silver lining for me, now I've got a few buddies I can have a beer with that I didn't have before, who know me well now, that in itself is a big deal for me. 

***** Small Goals / Recruiters / Research *****

4 - small goals of applications / cv tweaks or LI bio refreshes each week, every other week is good - whatever it is - small steps but consistent ones as is most practical, a few at a time do help. Don't try and do everything all at once, you'll see failure, you'll go into a hole and that isn't what will help.

5 - recruiters are in my experience helpful sometimes but don't rely on someone else to drive finding you a role. Recruiters can help, but frequently unhelpful and have a universal habit of ghosting, there is very little decency anymore, there should be some if there is an engagement between you and them but that's not the world we live in. When you do get ghosted, tell them to fuck off on your head, then move on. 

   I've spent far too much time being angry at other people for doing this, when if I think about it, I was nothing more than a possible fill to a position, one in a long line of candidates on their screen, just a number. Recruiters serve an input output function. If I view them as transactional which they are, I don't get as angry when they treat me this way, it's just the nature of the beast and the industry

6 - do your own research, your own cross check of roles, is it on LI = yes, is it on the employers site = No - probably a fake add or them trying to harvest data or salary check the market for how low they can actually put the salary, there's been lots of discussion of this in the states and it's hard to deal with so be stringent, vet and if it looks suss, move on. 

***** LinkedIn / Applying / Cover Letters *****

7 - if you find a role on LI, my opinion is don't apply on LinkedIn. Find the real job and apply on the company website, you'll get lost in the noise and your application won't be reviewed if you do it though LI. Given how many people throw applications at job ads, I would be surprised if it was looked at by a human but a recruiter can comment further. 

   Tweak your cv before you submit, if it doesn't align to the role, try and make it align without straight up lying. If you lie on your cv, you will get caught out eventually, it's what the multi round interview process is partly about, not just what's on the paper but who is the person, do they know what they claim to, do they fit the role etc

8 - apply widely (within reason). Not one job here, one job there. It won't work. It is a numbers game and you really do need to pump those numbers. It's the only way.

9 - cover letters are contentious - I would say if you have a role that you're made for, you'll know if it's the one - write a cover letter, one page and tell them why you. That plus a cv (resume), I would hope helps elevate you in the pile of cvs. 

   This has been hit and miss, again one for recruiters. I will ask my HR rep if mine made a difference, I think it did but will confirm and update thread. 

***** Key Words / Simplicity / LinkedIn Hell *****

10 - key words - no one is looking at your cv just off you hitting submit unless the hiring manager gets it directly and maybe you have a connection to them / you've LI-mailed them / already have a thread with them. Your cv goes through internal scanning (keyword matching etc), which I'm told frequently doesn't work as it's intended, resulting in people getting binned or overlooked that are a good match. 

   Look at the job ad, then if you have cross over skills but they aren't mentioned on your cv pull some of those words into your cv. You don't need to be fancy about it. Just have a section of ""Key Skills"" then start writing those seperate by a comma or forward slash - that's it. Make it easier for the scanners. 

11 - simplicity -  if a person were to read your cv and can't then at a bare minimum tell you what you do or have accomplished / achieved - how is a hiring manager supposed to know and apply it to their open role? I've spoken to many people about this and they all say the same thing. 

KISS will never get old: Keep It Simple Stupid

   Dont overestimate a hiring manager or recruiters ability to read your cv and know what you do - make it easy to understand. 

12 - be kind to yourself, you're going through in many respects - a traumatic experience. Treat yourself with care and actually take care of yourself, eat right, get proper sleep, temper the use of bad social media (reddit isn't included BUT reddit can be bad as with too much of anything can be). 

13 - turn off all LinkedIn notifications and unfollow people, this is a huge one - I personally could not handle all the self congratulatory, narcissistic, self ejaculation, masturbation horseshit aka the necessary hellscape that is LinkedIn over the last year. 

   It was eating my soul because I had to use it for role searching, so I tapped out of all of it 6 months or so ago. I had a rule of not looking at the LinkedIn feed AND ONLY using the job search / role search function / its power search to find hiring managers to connect and ping about applications I submitted. 

   I unfollowed pretty much my entire community - this was a self protection thing, I couldn't handle seeing other people's shit whether it was another person who landed or whatever, the platform sucked my motivation and self worth so I put a stop to it. I highly highly recommend if you're feeling like shit you do the same. I won't go back, there is no point just like all social media, it sucks enough of my time and for what gain, really? 

   Use it sparingly, if you can, then just get on with the job you eventually land and get the fuck off it (there are some roles where that isn't possible as your role is to live on LinkedIn. That isn't the case for me and I am glad, I just don't have the capacity for it and I know many feel the same way. 

**

These are some of my lessons learned and I hope they help you on your journey. This is the first real post I've done to reddit, if this should also go into another sub please let me know where to cross post if that's the right term? 

And most importantly, I would appreciate your feedback and input from your own experience, do you have crossover do these points resonate? Do you disagree, why? Are there things I've missed, no doubt!  

Tldr: vitamin D, family, friends, a side job outside your formal role search, baby steps that are consistent, cv tweaks, don't be too hard on yourself, this is a terrible environment but one step at a time Internet friends, one step at a time. ",5,1736648664.0,recruitinghell,1,1.0,False
1hzci1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hzci1v/totally_friendzoned_or_am_i/,"Totally friendzoned, or am I?","Hello,

So I have this friend I would like to get thoughts on...

Backstory:
We met around a year ago through a university project. Right off the bat we clicked super well, I had never felt so comfortable around a guy before, especially so fast. Didn't take long until we started spending long hours at school together almost on a daily basis. He would always initiate, drive me home, buy me coffee, always come to the gym when I said I would go, take me home again etc. Our connection grew quite deep - and then I found out he had a girl... of course. By that time I had managed to develop feelings, obviously, looking at the treatment he was giving me. Then my inner struggles began, doing everything in my power to overcome these immoral feelings I shouldn't have - multiple times I tried to cut contact but it always lead back to the same place, plus we had shared projects so it was almost impossible. From his side nothing changed either. 

Fast forward to this fall and I had managed to find peace in me, realizing I'm happy to have him as friend and all I want is for him to be happy, whomever with.

We still share a strong friendship and he is still acting the same way as before, even wanting to join the boxing club I'm going to... He also agreed to help me with bringing a new sofa to my place, which took 6hrs, a lot of driving, carrying and it was all at night lol.

I had a short period when I was dating this other guy, but (suprise suprise) it didn't work out as the emotional connection wasn't there.

This guy has never talked about his relationship with me, but a few days ago he learned I had broken things off with the guy I was dating. It was then when I learned he is really struggling in his relationship too. We haven't much hanged out outside of things related to school, but when I asked what's wrong he said it was so personal he would rather talk about it in real life so we are about to have a talk about it at a cafe now.

So probably you can sense the confusion I'm having here. He is a very outgoing person and I wonder if I'm overthinking the whole situation and if he is just being extremely friendly? Then again he is not having that kind of a friendship with anyone else I know.

It has been a messed up situation for way too long now and it is making me feel terrible as a person, but I really cannot put into words the way we care about each other. And booy have I tried to get over this thing. 

I know it raises judgement, and I guess the convo we're going to have when he's back in town might give some clarity, but I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts on this.

People around me are of course certain he has some kind of feelings, but could it be that it is truly just a strong friendship he sees in this?",1,1736648573.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

(pls help),"hi!! so i (20F) matched with this man (24M) who we’ll call Apple almost about 2 months ago. within the first week of talking, he asked me out on a date, which we ended up doing about a week later. the date went really well!! we had coffee, opened up, and i felt like the chemistry was there. as the date ended, we ended up kissing and held hands as he walked me to my car. he kept asking me for another date afterwards, which i agreed to, but would need to be in about a week and a half since i was going on vacation next week. we planned on a date and time, but no place. as he invited me, i expected him to pick a place. as the days got closer to the date we agreed on, he would text less and less, and eventually didn’t even text me like 2 days before the date. finally, he reached out a couple hours before the time we agreed on and asked me to recommend somewhere to eat since he’s “new to the area”. i recommended a place and we met up there. this date was really good as well, but it ended with no kiss; just a long awkward hug at the end. he apologized later for being “cold” towards the end of the date because i had no jacket on and he didn’t want me freezing while saying goodbye. after that date, he asked me out on another date, but this would be dinner and a movie at his place. i let him know that i’m not comfortable hanging out at his place YET since I barely know him, but i am more than happy to have dinner out and/or watch a movie at a movie theatre with him. he simply reacted to the message and didn’t respond. the following days, he stops replying, gets drier and drier, and eventually left me on delivered. all until my birthday came up, and he reached out saying happy birthday and asking me what i did. i left him on delivered since he had basically ghosted me. the following days i posted that i went out for coffee, which he replied to jokingly saying “isn’t that where we went?”. i simply reacted to both the birthday wishes and the other reply with a very dry haha yes and thank you. i actually ended up going on a spontaneous trip with one of my close friends to his hometown, which he obviously replied to my instagram story about. it’s important to note that he was consistently giving me dry replies to ALL my messages, yet liking all of my social media activity, and viewing everything the second i posted. as dumb and self-absorbed as it sounds, i was getting mixed signals and i have never been rejected romantically; everything bothered my ego. it was eating me alive; the confusion would make me think about him every second of my days. i ended up confiding in one of my close friends who advised me to simply ask him to meet up and get the closure i need. i did that :)! i asked him out for coffee before my trip, and he agreed to it right away. we, again, agreed on a date and time, but i let him know to pick a place. AGAIN, he stops talking to me after that and only responds the night before our arranged coffee. he simply says “would you like to go to ____ garden/park??” (not mentioning the name in case he’s reading this you prick). i kindly let him know that there’s currently construction in the area, and they’re closed. and again; throw the ball in his court to pick a place. he simply reacts to the message and doesn’t respond; ever. this was back in december. he still likes EVERYTHING on my social media, and views every story the minute i post, and has recently replied to one of them. i simply mirrored his behavior and reacted without responding. everything is screaming red flags, but it’s eating me alive. i don’t know whether to confront him and ask him for clarity/closure; a simple “hey im not feeling this connection anymore” would be MORE THAN ENOUGH, or to just block. or should i just hook up with him and move on (lol jk but not kidding!) pls help im begging i’ve done everything to stop thinking about him

(i forgot to mention this earlier, but in between the period when he stopped talking to me, he randomly asked me what i was up to one night, to which i replied that i had plans and that’s it. he said “that’s too bad, i was gonna ask you out for dinner or a movie if you’re down”. and i said no thank you; i have plans. he ignored me :))",1,1736648403.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
