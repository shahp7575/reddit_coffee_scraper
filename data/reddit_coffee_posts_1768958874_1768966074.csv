Last Friday, the Rural Municipality of Gimli announced that Chudd would be suspended from all mayoral duties from Jan. 16 to Jan. 22, but provided limited details.

“I feel like there are a lot of things going on here that I’ve questioned and never got answers for,” Gimli resident Debbie Fakes told CTV News on Monday.

Fakes has lived in Gimli for the last nine years and said it’s hard to find out if the sanctions fit the allegation.

“We don’t know what he has done, and we don’t know who came up with this week thing,” she said.

“Everybody is assuming all kinds of different things. If we definitely knew, people would know. But because of (the withholding of information), people are saying, ‘Could be this, could be that,’” said Daphne Markusson. “It’s kind of upsetting that we don’t really know what circumstance happened.

The Chief Administrative Officer of the RM of Gimli, DJ Sigmurdson, was not available for an interview but responded to CTV News via email.

“No details about complainants or complaints can be disclosed under provincial confidentiality rules,” Sigmurdson said in part.

CTV News asked which provincial law requires the confidentiality and was told it was “Manitoba’s Council Members’ Codes of Conduct Regulation,” under The Municipal Act.

“(The regulation) requires investigator reports, evidence, and findings to remain confidential except for what Council is permitted to disclose. This protects complainants, witnesses, and the integrity of the process.”",0,1768965665.0,Winnipeg,0,0.5,False
1qimolk,https://i.redd.it/2yxpl7oxemeg1.png,"Yes, We Use Plastic in Our Bags - And Here’s Why We Still Consider It Sustainable","This might sound contradictory coming from a sustainable brand, but here it is:

We use plastic in our bags.  
Specifically, in the inner lining.

And it’s a conscious choice.

The lining in every MaLeeMa bag is made from **recycled PET bottles** plastic that already exists in the system and would otherwise end up in landfills or oceans.

A lot of people ask:  
*Why not cotton or other natural fabrics instead?*

Because our bags are designed for **real life**, not just aesthetics.

Think:

* Office commutes
* Airports and travel
* Rainy days
* Coffee spills in cafés
* Laptops, documents, daily essentials

For these use cases, the lining needs to be **water resistant and protective**.  
Cotton and many natural fabrics simply can’t offer that level of performance without heavy chemical treatment.

Recycled plastic can.

So yes, we use plastic but it’s:

* **Recycled**, not virgin
* **Repurposed**, not newly produced
* **Intentional**, not mindless

To us, sustainability isn’t black and white.  
It’s not about eliminating every material it’s about **using materials responsibly, transparently, and for the right reasons**.

We focus on performance, longevity, and reducing net impact.  
And we believe that intentional choices matter more than perfect labels.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qimksi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qimksi/why_introverts_are_hot_and_how_to_make_it_work/,Why INTROVERTS Are Hot (And How to Make It WORK for You): The Psychology That Actually Works,"Everyone thinks introverts are doomed in the dating world. That they're too quiet, too boring, too ""in their head"" to compete with charismatic extroverts who light up every room.

But here's what I found after studying human psychology, reading everything from Susan Cain's research to Matthew Hussey's dating advice: introverts have a secret weapon most people completely miss. And once you understand how to leverage your natural traits (whether you're introverted or not), you become magnetic.

This isn't about faking extroversion or ""just putting yourself out there more."" It's about understanding what actually makes people attractive on a psychological level. And spoiler: it's not loudness.

**1. Deep presence beats surface level charm every single time**

Introverts naturally excel at one thing extroverts often struggle with: being fully present with someone. While the loud guy at the party is scanning the room for his next conversation, introverts lock in. They make whoever they're talking to feel like the only person in the world.

Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that perceived attentiveness is one of the strongest predictors of romantic attraction. People don't remember what you said as much as how you made them feel. And feeling truly seen? That's addictive.

I started using the Ash app (relationship coach/mental health tool) to work on my listening skills and honestly, the difference was wild. It taught me to ask better follow up questions instead of just waiting for my turn to talk. Game changer for conversations.

The trick is to practice active listening. Repeat back what they said in your own words. Ask ""what was that like for you?"" instead of immediately sharing your own story. This builds insane levels of connection fast.

**2. Selective social energy reads as high value**

Here's something most people get backwards: being selectively social actually makes you more attractive, not less. When introverts carefully choose who they spend time with, it signals discernment. It says ""my time and energy are valuable.""

Cal Newport talks about this in ""Digital Minimalism"" (not specifically about dating but the principle applies). He's a Georgetown professor who's written multiple bestsellers on focus and intentionality. The book destroys the myth that you need to be everywhere, doing everything, to be successful or attractive. It's about quality over quantity.

When you're not desperately seeking validation from everyone, people notice. They want to be in your inner circle. Scarcity principle at work.

I'm not saying become a hermit. But being the person who shows up to fewer things but is fully engaged when they do? That's powerful. People start wondering what you're doing when you're not there.

**3. Thoughtfulness is underrated and insanely sexy**

Introverts process internally before speaking. This means when they do share something, it's usually more substantive. They remember little details. They send the perfect meme three days after a conversation because something reminded them of you.

Esther Perel (legendary couples therapist, her podcast "" [Where Should We Begin?] (https://www.estherperel.com/podcast) "" is absolutely insane if you want to understand relationship dynamics) talks about how eroticism comes from anticipation and thoughtfulness, not just spontaneity. The person who remembers you mentioned your presentation on Tuesday and texts to ask how it went? That's attractive.

Use the Finch app if you struggle with follow through on habits. I use it to remind myself to check in with people, send that article I mentioned, basically be more intentional instead of just reactive. Sounds robotic but it actually helps you become more genuinely thoughtful.

Small gestures compound. Bring their favorite coffee without being asked. Reference something they said weeks ago. These things create emotional imprints.

**4. Mystery and depth keep people curious**

Extroverts often give everything away immediately. Introverts naturally maintain some mystery because they don't overshare. And psychologically, humans are drawn to what they don't fully understand yet.

Robert Greene's "" [The Art of Seduction](https://powerseductionandwar.com/the-art-of-seduction/) "" breaks this down perfectly (yes it's a bit manipulative if used wrong, but the psychology is solid). Greene spent years researching historical seducers and found that maintaining intrigue is crucial. You don't need to be an open book on date one. Let people discover layers over time.

This doesn't mean playing games or being deliberately withholding. It means not anxiety dumping your entire life story because you're nervous. Not explaining every joke. Not filling every silence.

Comfortable silence is actually one of the most intimate things you can share with someone. If you can sit quietly together without it being weird, that's a green flag.

**5. Independence is magnetic**

Introverts recharge alone. They have rich internal worlds. Hobbies they genuinely enjoy doing solo. And nothing is more attractive than someone who has a full life that you'd be lucky to become part of, rather than someone who needs you to complete them.

[Attached](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/303069/attached-by-amir-levine-md-and-rachel-sf-heller-ma/) by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (this book is a must read if you've ever struggled with relationship anxiety or picking the wrong people) explains attachment theory in the most accessible way. Secure attachment, the healthy kind, comes from being whole on your own first. Introverts often naturally develop this because they're comfortable with themselves.

The most attractive thing you can do is genuinely enjoy your own company. Have passions. Read books. Take yourself to movies. When someone enters your life, they should add to it, not complete it.

I use Insight Timer for meditation (has thousands of free guided sessions, way better than Headspace imo) to get comfortable with just being alone with my thoughts. Sounds basic but it builds that core of self sufficiency that people find compelling.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI learning app that creates personalized audio content from books, expert talks, and research papers tailored to your specific goals. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts, it's particularly useful for diving deeper into psychology and relationship topics.

You can customize everything, from a quick 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with detailed examples. The voice options are genuinely addictive (I use the smoky, sarcastic one during workouts). It also builds an adaptive learning plan based on what you're actually trying to improve, whether that's social skills or understanding attachment theory better. The personalized approach makes complex psychology concepts way easier to digest and actually apply.

**How to actually leverage this**

Stop apologizing for being quiet. Reframe it. You're observant. Thoughtful. Intentional.

In dating specifically, suggest date activities that play to your strengths. Coffee shop conversations over loud bars. Museum walks. Bookstore browsing. Places where depth of conversation matters more than high energy performance.

Work on your one on one skills instead of trying to be the life of the party. Get insanely good at making one person feel special. That's how relationships actually form anyway.

And look, some situations require you to be more outgoing. Job interviews, networking events, meeting your partner's friends. That's fine. You can adapt temporarily. But stop thinking you need to fundamentally change your personality to be attractive.

The right people will be drawn to exactly what you already are. Your job is just to present it confidently instead of apologetically.",1,1768965332.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False
1qimkqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoSlim/comments/1qimkqh/can_i_lose_weight_without_exercising/,Can I Lose Weight Without Exercising?,"**Yes, you can lose weight without exercising. Weight loss happens when you eat fewer calories than your body burns, and your body burns most calories just existing, not moving. Exercise accounts for only 5-15% of daily calorie burn for most people.**

I lost my first 40 pounds in my twenties eating differently, not running on treadmills. That experience got me obsessed with nutrition, led me to get NASM certified, and shaped how I work with hundreds of clients today. Most of them have jobs, kids, injuries, or just hate the gym. They still lose weight.

## Why Does Weight Loss Happen Without Exercise?

**Weight loss occurs because your body needs energy to function and takes that energy from stored fat when you don't eat enough. Your heart, brain, liver, and kidneys burn roughly 80% of your daily calories without you lifting a finger. Exercise adds surprisingly little to this equation.**

Your body runs a 24/7 operation. Breathing, pumping blood, regulating temperature, digesting food, repairing cells. This is your Basal Metabolic Rate, and for a 180-pound person, that's around 1,800 calories daily just lying in bed.

Add basic movement like walking to the fridge, typing, showering, and you burn another 200-400 calories. This is called NEAT, Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis.

A typical gym session burns 200-400 calories. That's roughly the same as one bagel with cream cheese. The math becomes obvious: controlling what goes into your mouth has far more leverage than controlling what happens in the gym.

## How Much Weight Can You Realistically Lose Without Working Out?

**You can lose 1-2 pounds per week without any exercise by maintaining a 500-1000 calorie daily deficit through food alone. Over a year, that's 50-100 pounds of pure fat loss, assuming you stay consistent.**

The 500-calorie deficit rule works because one pound of fat stores about 3,500 calories. Cut 500 daily, lose a pound weekly. Simple arithmetic.

I've had clients drop 60+ pounds over eight months without stepping into a gym once. One woman, a night-shift nurse with three kids, lost 73 pounds in eleven months. Her exercise was walking hospital hallways during shifts.

The catch? Consistency beats intensity. A moderate deficit you maintain for months outperforms an aggressive deficit you abandon after two weeks. This is where most people fail, and honestly, it's why I started recommending [**a specific metabolic support supplement**](https://fat-loss-switch.pages.dev)🚀 to my clients. The first few weeks of any calorie deficit feel brutal, and having something that takes the edge off cravings makes the difference between quitting and pushing through.

## What Actually Controls Your Weight If Not Exercise?

**Your weight is controlled by energy balance, hormones, and your food environment. Calories determine the direction of the scale, hormones affect hunger and storage patterns, and your environment decides how easy or hard sticking to a plan becomes.**

### Calorie Balance

Eat less than you burn, you lose weight. Eat more, you gain. No supplement, food combination, or meal timing overrides this. Keto works because people eat fewer calories. Intermittent fasting works because people eat fewer calories. Carnivore works because people eat fewer calories.

The diet itself is just a vehicle for calorie reduction.

### Hormonal Influence

Insulin, leptin, ghrelin, cortisol. These hormones regulate hunger, fullness, and where your body stores fat. Chronic stress spikes cortisol, which promotes belly fat storage. Poor sleep tanks leptin, making you feel hungry even when you've eaten enough.

You don't need to measure hormones. You need to sleep 7-8 hours and manage stress. The hormones follow.

### Food Environment

If cookies sit on your counter, you eat cookies. If vegetables fill your fridge, you eat vegetables. Your willpower is limited. Your environment is controllable.

I tell every client: don't fight cravings with discipline. Fight them with distance. Keep trigger foods out of arm's reach, ideally out of the house entirely.

## How Do I Create a Calorie Deficit Without Hitting the Gym?

**Create a calorie deficit by tracking your intake, eating more protein, filling half your plate with vegetables, drinking water before meals, and eliminating liquid calories. These five changes alone produce a 500+ calorie daily reduction for most people.**

### Track Everything for Two Weeks

Before changing anything, log what you eat using MyFitnessPal or Cronometer. Most people underestimate intake by 30-50%. That ""healthy salad"" with dressing, croutons, and cheese hits 900 calories. That handful of almonds repeated four times a day adds 600 calories.

Awareness alone creates change. Clients often drop 3-5 pounds just from tracking, no intentional restriction.

### Protein at Every Meal

Protein keeps you full longer than carbs or fat. It also requires more energy to digest, burning about 20-30% of its calories just processing it. That's called the thermic effect of food.

Aim for 30 grams of protein per meal. That's roughly a chicken breast, a cup of Greek yogurt, or four eggs. Hit this target and hunger becomes manageable.

### Vegetables Fill Volume

Vegetables are basically free food. A pound of broccoli has 150 calories. A pound of pasta has 1,600. Fill half your plate with non-starchy vegetables and you physically cannot overeat.

Spinach, peppers, zucchini, cauliflower, green beans, asparagus. These are your weapons against hunger.

### Pre-Meal Hydration

Drinking 16 ounces of water 30 minutes before meals reduces calorie intake by roughly 75 calories per meal. That's 225 fewer calories daily from a free, zero-effort habit.

Thirst often masks as hunger. Before reaching for food, drink water and wait 15 minutes.

### Eliminate Liquid Calories

Soda, juice, fancy coffee drinks, alcohol. These add hundreds of calories with zero satiety. A grande mocha from Starbucks has 360 calories. A can of Coke has 140. Three beers at dinner add 450.

Switch to water, black coffee, unsweetened tea. This single change creates enough deficit for many people to lose weight without touching anything else.

## What Should I Eat to Lose Weight Without Exercise?

**Eat whole, single-ingredient foods: lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. These foods are naturally lower in calories, higher in nutrients, and nearly impossible to overeat compared to processed alternatives.**

Processed food engineers design products to override your satiety signals. They combine fat, sugar, and salt in ratios that trigger dopamine and keep you eating past fullness. Whole foods don't have this problem.

Here's a sample day at roughly 1,600 calories:

Breakfast: Three scrambled eggs with spinach and tomatoes. Black coffee. Around 350 calories.

Lunch: Large salad with grilled chicken, cucumber, bell peppers, olive oil, and vinegar. Around 450 calories.

Dinner: Baked salmon with roasted broccoli and a small sweet potato. Around 550 calories.

Snack: Greek yogurt with berries. Around 200 calories.

Notice what's missing: no bread, no pasta, no rice, no chips. These aren't evil foods, but they're easy to overeat and don't keep you full. When you're not exercising, every calorie counts more.

## Will I Lose Muscle If I Don't Exercise?

**You will lose some muscle without exercise, typically 20-25% of total weight lost comes from lean mass instead of fat. Eating adequate protein (0.7-1 gram per pound of body weight) minimizes this loss but doesn't eliminate it entirely.**

This matters more for some people than others. If you're 100 pounds overweight, losing some muscle while dropping 60 pounds of fat is a worthwhile trade. If you're 15 pounds overweight and want to look toned, muscle preservation becomes more relevant.

The protein recommendation isn't arbitrary. Research consistently shows that high-protein diets during weight loss preserve significantly more muscle than low-protein diets. A 200-pound person should aim for 140-200 grams of protein daily.

If muscle preservation matters to you, consider adding resistance training two to three times weekly. You don't need a gym. Pushups, squats, lunges, and planks at home maintain most muscle mass during a deficit.

## How Fast Will I See Results Without Working Out?

**You'll see scale results within the first week and visible body changes within three to four weeks. Water weight drops quickly in days one through seven, then fat loss follows at roughly one to two pounds per week.**

The first week is deceptive. You might lose 4-7 pounds, mostly water and glycogen. This isn't fat loss, but it's motivating.

Real fat loss shows up by week three. Clothes fit differently. Your face looks leaner. The number on the scale keeps moving downward, just slower than that initial drop.

This is the danger zone where many people quit. They expect week one results to continue and feel discouraged when they ""only"" lose one pound in week four. One pound per week is 52 pounds per year. That's excellent progress.

I've seen this pattern enough that I now prepare clients upfront. The scale will lie to you some days. Water retention from sodium, hormonal fluctuations, bowel movements. Your weight fluctuates 2-5 pounds daily. Focus on the weekly average, not daily numbers.

For clients struggling with this plateau frustration, I typically suggest [**the same fat-loss support I use myself**](https://fat-loss-switch.pages.dev)🚀. It helps maintain momentum when early motivation fades, and the clients using it report fewer cravings and more consistent weekly drops.

## Who Should Lose Weight Without Exercise?

**People with injuries, mobility limitations, extreme time constraints, or exercise-related anxiety should absolutely lose weight through diet alone. Weight loss through food restriction is medically valid and often more sustainable than forcing unwanted exercise.**

Exercise has benefits beyond calorie burn: mood improvement, cardiovascular health, strength, bone density. But these benefits don't require weight loss as a prerequisite. Lose the weight first through diet, then add movement when your body feels ready.

I work with clients who have:

Chronic back pain that makes gym work impossible. Severe obesity where joint stress from exercise causes injury. Demanding careers leaving zero time for structured workouts. Past trauma associated with gyms or fitness culture.

None of these situations prevent weight loss. They just change the approach.

## Common Mistakes When Losing Weight Without Exercise

**The biggest mistakes are cutting calories too aggressively, relying on motivation instead of systems, eating ""healthy"" foods without tracking portions, and expecting linear progress. Each mistake leads to the same result: quitting before reaching the goal.**

### Aggressive Restriction

Eating 1,000 calories when your body needs 2,200 works for about ten days. Then your hunger hormones revolt, your energy crashes, and you binge. Moderate deficits of 500-750 calories daily are sustainable. Extreme deficits are not.

### Motivation Dependency

Motivation fades. Everyone starts strong on Monday. The question is what happens Thursday night when you're tired and pizza sounds good.

Build systems: meal prep on Sundays, keep no junk in the house, order groceries online to avoid impulse purchases. Systems work when motivation doesn't.

### Portion Distortion

A tablespoon of olive oil has 120 calories. Most people pour three tablespoons and call it ""one."" Peanut butter, nuts, cheese, avocado. These are healthy foods with massive calorie density. Eyeballing portions leads to unintentional overeating.

Measure everything for at least two weeks. Use a food scale. You'll recalibrate your portion perception and learn what actual serving sizes look like.

### Expecting Perfection

You will have bad days. You will eat pizza at a birthday party. You will drink too much at a wedding. This doesn't ruin anything unless you let one bad day become a bad week.

One 3,000-calorie day in a month of 1,600-calorie days barely registers mathematically. The problem is psychological. People feel guilty, decide they've ""ruined it,"" and abandon the plan entirely.

Progress requires persistence, not perfection.

## Does Losing Weight Without Exercise Work Long-Term?

**Yes, dietary weight loss maintains long-term when you transition to maintenance calories slowly and build sustainable eating habits during the loss phase. People who lose weight through diet alone keep it off at the same rates as those who exercise, provided they don't return to old eating patterns.**

The National Weight Control Registry tracks people who've lost 30+ pounds and kept it off for years. Their common traits: weighing themselves regularly, eating breakfast, watching portion sizes, staying physically active. Notice that structured exercise isn't mandatory. General physical activity like walking and daily movement appears frequently.

Your body adapts to lower weight by burning fewer calories. A 150-pound person burns less than a 200-pound person doing identical activities. When you reach your goal weight, you can't return to previous eating quantities. Your new normal requires new portions.

This adjustment feels unfair. It's simply biology. Accept it, plan for it, and weight maintenance becomes straightforward.

---

Losing weight without exercising is completely achievable and sometimes the smartest approach. Diet controls the scale. Exercise provides other benefits but isn't required for fat loss.

What makes the difference is having the right support, especially in those first brutal weeks. That's exactly why I recommend [**this metabolic support supplement**](https://fat-loss-switch.pages.dev)🚀 to everyone serious about losing weight. Clients who use it see their scale move faster, experience fewer cravings, and actually stick with the program long enough to hit their goals.

Here's what to remember:

- Weight loss requires a calorie deficit, not exercise
- Your body burns 80%+ of calories through basic functions
- Protein, vegetables, and water are your primary tools
- Track food intake to expose hidden calories
- Expect 1-2 pounds of fat loss weekly after initial water weight drop
- Build systems instead of relying on motivation
- Moderate deficits beat aggressive restriction every time

1qimfhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qimfhj/limping_in_isolation/,Limping In Isolation,"**Part One**

Alone, gasping through each morsel of air heavy with the taste of iron. I must keep moving, I can feel it approaching. The broken bones and ripped flesh are an afterthought; there is almost nothing left. The burden to express the pain has gone, I need not whimper or cry for all of the misery. With only fear and necessity remaining, I keep limping forward desperately. Eventually, my vision begins to tunnel inward, and I collapse, perceiving the last image of the tall grass and my outstretched, mangled hand reaching towards anything. As the darkness envelopes what's left of my vision, I see a blurry, small black animal trotting over; it’s my cat Milo. He lets out a soft meow and licks my face. Everything fades into a deep darkness, void of anything that ever was or could be.

Suddenly, I jolt upward with my hands reaching outward as if to attempt to grasp at reality. I’m covered in sweat, violently shaking, my heart is still racing, and fear lingers from that terrible place I keep dreaming about. I finally calm down and look around, I’m in my room in my bed, there is nothing to fear. My cat Milo, sitting beside me on the nightstand, meows curiously while staring at me. Positioning myself at the edge of the bed, I stare at the door while hunched over in exhaustion. Eventually, I look back at Milo, who is patiently staring back, and he lets out a soft meow again. “Hey buddy, sorry about that, I’ve gotta get that under control before I see Amber next time”, he lifts his chin in agreement as I scratch his neck. “There’s something wrong with me, buddy, but we will figure it out, and everything will be okay”, he meows as he jumps to the floor, slowly motioning towards the door as if to say it’s time for food. Before I can work up the motivation to stand, I hear a door open outside, followed by a loud stretching yawn, “You talking to your cat again, you gay homo?” Brian asks mockingly through the door. I chuckle for a second, then respond, “Hey fuck you, guy.” I hear a brief laugh followed by the squeak of the faucet and water splashing in the sink. I finally mustered the courage to get up and behave as a normal “well-adjusted” 23-year-old man should.

I stagger through the door half-awake, Brian asks, “So are you talking to that cat because it’s the closest thing you’ll ever get to pussy?” while padding his face with a towel and side eyeing me with a shit-eating grin. laughing, I respond, “As if you can talk, at least I have Amber, who was the last girl who even responded to you?” “If I recall… Actually, I don’t recall, I’m starting to think you’re batting for another team”,  “But don’t you worry, I’ll still love and accept you.” He looks down, shaking his head before closing the door. I make my way to the kitchen and look for what morsels of leftover takeout might be lying around. I know there’s not a damn thing in the cupboards, and don’t even bother looking. As I open the fridge, I’m hit with the whiff of repeated procrastination and close it immediately. Brian might be a bad roommate, but honestly, so am I, so it works out, and we get along pretty well. We met our freshman year at NDSU and instantly hit it off because of our mutual passion for drinking and not planning for the future. We both dropped out after one semester. He worked through several jobs while living in his parents' basement and eventually found his niche in construction. I had not found any niche and started at the local grocery store, where I have continued to work for the last five years, but eventually Brian was enough of an adult to take on the task of subleasing an apartment, and we’ve been back to hanging out every day. Eventually, I accept there is nothing but a shitty attempt at making our fridge cultivate a new ecosystem, so I throw a K-Cup in the coffee maker and roll a joint.   
  
With my coffee and joint, I sit outside staring blankly at the trash and slush-covered road, thinking about the burden of dissociation I’ve been experiencing after my recurring nightmare. I’m interrupted by the flap of the cat door opening and Milo staring up at me, disappointed. I hurry over, still lit joint in my mouth, to the kitchen and dump some kibble into one of his little bowls and pour some bottled water into the other. I hear the shower suddenly turn off, followed by the rampant sniffing noises similar to a police K-9. Brian opens the door, poking his head out, and kindly asks for once, “Hey, you mind sharing that?” I tilt my head back, smirking, “Of course you fucking burnout, but put your clothes on first, you druggie hippie”.  Even if this isn’t what I thought life would be, it could be worse; it’s not even bad, honestly, we just don’t really envision ending up where we do in life. When my mother was alive, she had such high aspirations for me; she saw my test scores and exclaimed all of the amazing things I would do in life. She would boast that I would be the one to go to college and have the success our broken family never achieved. Then I was motivated, I felt love and hope to bring joy and better things into our lives. However, after I left her and Milo for college in that broken-down apartment we called home, she passed unexpectedly. 

As

Her body was never recovered, and all they found were her tattered clothes and blood in the woods. The police think it was a bear because of how brutal the scene appeared to be. She seemed to have fled for quite a while before she perished. They believe it was caused by a psychotic episode; it was too cold for her to be wearing that dress wandering out there, and she would have never done anything like that. The homeless person outside the gas station said she walked by, pleading for me, asking where I was before running off desperately. I was all she had, and I left her like that. It’s probably why I’ve been having these dreams ever since. Milo could have starved to death alone in that apartment, but thankfully, he managed to knock the bag with his food over and fat by the time the police found him. While my mom was suffering, he was lounging and living like a king. Part of me resents that, but he’s all I have left of our broken family. While blankly staring down at him, chomping away happily, lost in thought, I’m brought back to reality by the harsh burn of the joint on my fingers. Brian walks out disappointed at the morsel I’ve left him, and looks at me like a sad puppy. I sarcastically raise the rest to him, and he rolls his eyes before burning himself repeatedly trying to get the last of it. Eventually, the burns got to be too much, and he put it out in the sink, “thanks,” he says sarcastically while coughing and spitting the ash from the burnt filter. I just reach into my backpack and raise the bag by my head, smirking at him, “One more before work?” 

I stroll confidently into Sal’s Grocery, reeking so badly that an old lady lurches from me into her husband while walking by. “Have a great day, ma’am, thanks for stopping by Sal’s, where half price sounds just right!” I gleefully exclaim as I nod to her like an asshole. She just shakes her head and mutters while walking off, and her husband just closes his eyes and smirks while also shaking his head. Part of me wishes I were a better person, but the other part of me that supercedes that whole narrative really doesn’t give a fuck. I smile peacefully with half-closed eyelids and float past my manager, Dave, who just looks at me like “really”. While walking to the break room to clock in, I see Amber holding two different pineapples, explaining something to a customer. I catch her sight and give her a wink with a smirk, and she looks away, blushing, before regaining her composure and continuing to explain some bullshit about pineapples. I walk past my edgy, scary coworker and greet him with forced optimism, “Hey Edgar, what up man!” He stops pushing his cart stares blankly at the ground for a moment, with his hoody on and the black eye liner he was pretty scary and I really didn’t want him to come kill everyone that works and shops here. “Good afternoon, James, did you do what I asked…” He mutters, still staring blankly at the ground. I tried to force some bullshit to appease him,m but just kept fumbling over what to say, “Um… I-I”. “STOP,” he yells as he suddenly puts his hand up. He stares deeply through me now, his finger glove inches from my face. “Do you know how important this is… That Led Zeppelin album, when listened to during a full moon, will change you forever”. He then gets uncomfortably close and whispers, “Change you forever” in a way that feels loud. “I, yeah, man, I listened to it… the whole thing… it was crazy… how the vibe changed for me when those… riffs hit.” He made a growling noise then said “do not attempt to appease me mortal… the reckoning will come soon…” then hunched over his cart to the frozen section. I stood stunned for a moment. That’s our employee of the month. He growls at people and scares everyone, but he’s also been here a long time and shows more work ethic; he’ll probably be the new assistant manager somehow. Our last one showed up drunk for the fourth time and started balling at a customer about them eating meat. I noticed the time on the wall, it’s exactly 9:00, and I need to clock in, so I hurried to the break room and almost knocked Delores over on my way. I frantically apologized and clocked in at exactly 9:59. God, I hope Edgar doesn’t kill us.

Part Two

A few months have passed, and honestly, I feel better. Things are going well with Amber, but my car broke down suddenly, and it was inevitable. Completely fucked the engine, and I just left it on the side of the road where it broke. I live walking distance away from work, so life goes on. Because of this, Amber has been picking me up and dropping me off, and the rides together have brought us close; she finally started coming over to the house. I begged Brian to be a normal sentient human being for once, and he begrudgingly agreed, but he’s been behaving when she’s around. Life isn’t perfect, but it seems like it’s getting better. The recurring dream hasn’t stopped; it’s actually been happening more often, but thankfully, it hasn’t happened when I’m sleeping next to Amber. Milo has been good and healthy, too. He seems to like Amber, but she seems to keep her distance from him. She claims to like cats, but I don’t really believe her.   


This morning, Amber quickly texted me saying she couldn’t drive me out of nowhere. I quickly threw on my uniform and basically ran to work. It’s February now, so it was miserable, but at least I wasn’t drenched in sweat. I walked in and noticed my manager grimace when he saw me. I didn’t really pay it any mind and continued to clock in. I noticed Amber on my way, but she quickly looked away after glancing at me, in a different way than usual. I felt a deep pain briefly, and  I was starting to worry. After getting to the break room, I clocked in three minutes late. Edgar was sitting hunched up like a gerbil there, quickly eating Takis in the corner. He took our five-minute breaks very seriously. While staring blankly at the table, he muttered, “James… The dark one looms… It intends to take you.” Confused and amused, I just said, “Yeah… thanks for the warning, buddy.” Before walking off, as odd as he was, I didn't feel endangered around him anymore. I made my way to the produce section looking for Amber. I saw Rebecca, another produce worker, and awkwardly asked, “Hey, have you seen Amber? I kind of want to talk to her if she’s around”. She looked condescendingly up at me and said, “James give her space, to be honest, I don’t even know what her deal is today, but that girl needs room to breathe.” before popping her gum and continuing to stare. “Alrighty,” I grimaced and walked away.

On the schedule today, I was working in the frozen section with Edgar. I expected another casual day of intriguing anecdotes from the morbid oddball, like usual. Instead, today something was different, when I walked into the freezer room, something felt off. There was a chill beyond cold; it just felt odd. I closed the door behind me as I went inside and looked at all the boxes, wondering where Edgar was before pulling my phone out to text him. I heard a shuffle behind me, and from the dark corner of the freezer Edgar emerged from behind with his head hanging down, just enough so he could still barely see me while staring up. He was blocking the door, and I felt a tinge of uncertainty. “Envious they are… They will never feast…” He said coarsely with a deep, toothy smile across his face. “Um, Edgar, you’re kind of freaking me out, man.” “He just continued to stare, rolling his hanging head from side to side while smiling. I heard a familiar clicking of the company-issued razor blade come from inside his pocket. He then started shaking with excitement, almost vibrating with fleeting anticipation while pulling out the knife from his pocket, allowing his arms to dangle by his sides. He rolled his head back, staring upward. “E-Easy man, what are you doing, look I don’t know wha-”. He cut me off, “I AM THEM, AND WE ARE THEY. WHY DO WE STARVE WITHOUT SALVATION?” he yelled. I backed up against the wall of the freezer, and he started slowly staggering towards me while clawing at his neck and chest with his free hand. I felt fear and dread deep within me. This dude was going to kill me; he finally lost it. Then I remembered something: this five-foot-tall little dork only eats Takis and doesn’t do anything physical. I cocked back my fist, and for the first time, I threw it as hard as I could. 

He instantly crumpled to the ground, crying, quickly putting the razor blade back in his pocket. His nose basically exploded, and in a weird way, I felt bad, all of that, and he kind of just folded like damp newspaper on the sidewalk. “HOW DARE YOU?” he screamed in a shrill tone, “THY VILE PEON NOT DARE TOUCH ME WITH HIS APE HANDS”. I just stood there blankly, watching him explode. My manager walked in, guided by Dolores, who stood behind, worried. They saw Edgar on the ground, who was crying now, then Edgar said, “HE STRUCK ME UNPROVOKED, HE STRUCK ME UNPROVOKED” and just kept repeating it over and over. The manager said nothing, just staring at him until he finally stopped, then looked at me with anger and disappointment. Then he just turned away and said, “Leave, or I’m calling the police, you’re fired.” I tried stammering to defend myself, but he just said, “Don’t,” sharply and walked out. Dolores walked over to Edgar and started coddling him, glancing at me with disappointment occasionally. It felt surreal. I just lost my job for defending myself from a psycho. I just dropped my apron and walked home. 

I sat alone while Brian was at work, Amber wasn’t responding to my messages, and I felt empty. Milo was still beside me,e but I finally started getting somewhere in my life, and it hurt so much to lose these things I thought I didn’t care about. Eventually, I felt myself dozing off in the chair. The dream was different this time; this time, it wasn’t me shambling in fear. I stood there watching my mother in a snow-covered clearing. She looked so broken and alone, her knee was bruised purple, and there were cuts all over her body; it looked like she had run through the trees blindly in the night. Tears streamed down my face as I saw her desperately trying to go somewhere; one of her eyes was shut and bleeding, but she kept moving like she had somewhere to be. Then she spoke, and my whole world fell. “James, please.” “James, I’m sorry.” “I’m so sorry, sweetie, James.” “Please, James.” ""Please, I’m sorry, James”. Then she collapsed, but she kept pleading. I fell to my knees, tears pouring out as I tried to reassure her or help her or do anything. It felt like a force wall was between us. As I reached out to her, I could never touch her. Eventually, I just collapsed next to my pleading mother, bringing my knees to my chest. This empty world was so cruel and hateful. Why could anything let this happen to someone as pure as her? The snow came down around me, and she and I wept, begging for anything to help. Finally, when something came, I heard the soft trot of a small animal on the snow. Milo came over and went to my mother this time, and licked her face. Then again, and again, until finally he bit down. He started tearing into her eyes. I stared mortified, unable to do anything, she just kept pleading for me, “James,” “I’m so sorry, James,” “James, please,” “Please”. I could feel my vision going black, and my body started to contract and shake. I tried to scream, but could only let out slight whimpers as I lay there shaking in deep pain. Suddenly, I woke up to my cat sitting on my chest staring at me closely. I felt deep dread, and my body was impossibly exhausted. I tried to push him away, but could barely manage the strength to move my arm. I barely manage to mutter “Get off”. It just stared blankly, and I turned my head to the side to look away. I could still feel him staring.

**Part Three**

It’s been two weeks since I got fired and had a seizure. Brian eventually came home and brought me tothe  E.R. I begged him not to, but he insisted and told me his parents would cover the bill. I was just lying there, paralyzed in my sweat and piss until Brian ran in and pushed the cat off of me when he saw I was struggling to breathe. It hissed at him angrilyand then ran out the open door. He then carried me in his arms all the way to the hospital five blocks away. Hehe was there when I finally fully recovered. I was severely dehydrated, and part of my face and arm were unable to move. The doctor insisted this wouldn’t persist for more than a week and reassured me, despite my concern that I would be okay. I told Brian everything that happened from the dreams I’ve been having to the worst one of them all, which I just experienced. I could tell he felt so badly, but couldn’t do anything to help. I didn’t know what to do with myself; my phone was destroyed after being covered in piss during the episode. I felt so unsure of everything and myself; I didn’t know what I was capable of or if I even cared, but I felt afraid. A deep fear that caused me to shut down, eyes darting around the room in anticipation of something horrible happening. I was running low on money already, despite Brian's insistence on his parents' help. I paid for the hospital visit and insisted I had been saving for years. I have refused to leave the house since the incident and genuinely feared what people thought of me or must have heard. 

Then I heard a formal distinct \**knock knock\** from the door, I flinched and steadied myself. I slowly approached the door and attempted to peer through the hole. Then, as I was about to look again, \**knock knock*\* but louder, I flinched, almost falling back. Finally, I tried looking again. It was a bald middle-aged man with tired eyes who stared blankly at the door. I slowly opened it and stammered, “H-hello”. He paused, looking at my disheveled, unkept appearance briefly, then blankly said, “You little fucking junkie prick”. “Huh? Wai-” He threw the door open, sending me falling on my back. He lunged on top of me and grabbed me by my neck. Holding up a fist and screaming in my face, “I OUGHTA FUCKING KILL YOU!. His grip tightened around my neck, and I pleaded, “Pl-please, sir, who are you?. “WHO THE FUCK AM I?” “YOU MOTHERFUCKER” and he struck me in the face, nearly knocking me unconscious. I felt my nose leaking something warm all over my face and neck as he let go of me, and my head hit the floor. “HOW FUCKING DARE YOU!?” He screamed. I just lay there empty, unable to do anything, staring up at the ceiling as he paced around breathing heavily. “Little fucker.” he muttered. “My son almost died because of what you got him into, he was such a good fucking kid”. I didn’t have the motivation to do anything but look at him with an empty, pleading look of confusion. “He told me about you, you fucking OD’d and wanted us to cover the bill?” “Remember that you junkie fucking prick?” “Well guess who finally got caught on his way to work, they pulled the company truck over and he’s got all these pills so now he’s in jail right fucking now while you’re here high as a kite.” “fucking hippie”. I finally worked up the courage to speak again, “B-Brian?” “Wow, there we fucking go, you remembered his fucking name, EAT SHIT!” “Good luck on your rent, you fuckwad junkie hippie retard fuck, I looked into it, and you never had him sign anything, he’s moving back home”. He spat at the ground and slammed the door as he left. I lay there and brought my knees to my chest. “What the fuck?”

Later, I learned Brian was addicted to painkillers the whole time, and that’s how he got through 60+ hours a week of manual labor, and why he always managed to be poorer than me somehow as a grocer. I had no idea what was going on; I  didn’t know much about his family or even him in that manner. Looking back, as much as I appreciated him, we never did more than joke around and give each other shit. I can’t even blame his dad for blaming me; I’d blame me too. Inevitability came knocking later that week in the form of a notice to vacate the premises due to failure to pay rent. I guess Mr. Kim didn’t believe I was capable of continuing our agreement alone after a week. Honestly, he was right, I am nothing, there is nothing, I can’t think of anything left. I didn’t have many possessions anyway, so I just blankly went to my room and grabbed a blanket. I walked out the door and went down the street. There was an alley next to the nearby laundromat, and I huddled for whatever warmth I could alone the entire day. I sat there shivering with a 1000-yard stare at the brick wall, thinking about nothing but being overwhelmed by everything at once. I kept hearing murmurs and people talking as they walked by; some snickered, some were disgusted, and others had genuine malice in their voices. I paid as little attention as possible and just stared ahead. I could feel my stomach yearning for food, but I had no desire to do anything and just kept staring until I finally nodded off again. 

Thankfully, this time I didn’t dream, but I felt something wake me up, but I didn’t really notice anything around me until I looked across the street. Then I locked eyes with another homeless man, who was staring at me with so much malice and hate that it seethed from him. He reminded me of Brian's dad. I realized at that moment I had something left, fear of pain, I didn’t want to suffer anymore. I quickly got to my feet and started trying my best to move down the street. My stomach hurt, and the thunderfuck for a fist Brian's dad had brought down on me still pulsed with pain. I glanced behind me, and he was sprinting with an upright posture, eyes still locked on me, head not moving at all. I dropped my blanket and ran as fast as I could. There was a young guy about my age. I tried to plead with him, but he shoved me to the ground hard and muttered “fucking junkie”. I scrambled to my feet, then ran past the end of the street to the hiking trail, deeper and deeper until I realized it was all black around me. I was lost and couldn’t see. I paused and stood there, not making a noise, listening for anyone or anything else. I collapsed, my breathing started to grow more and more rapid, and I realized I was breaking down. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my lighter, finally bringing something into this void. I stared at the flame and steadied my breath. Eventually, calming down back to the emptiness I’ve come to know so well. I didn’t care that the lighter burnt my fingers; it was the last semblance of warmth and light I had. I appreciated every moment of it up until it finally sputtered out, and I just sat there on the side of the trail. I knew I would succumb to the cold eventually. Deep down, I wanted to. Then I heard a soft \**meow*\* ahead of me. 

**Part Four**

I knew it was Milo, but I didn’t feel warmth or hope. I felt fear, and I sat there as still as I could. Then again \**Meow*\* but a little raspier and deeper. Then again, \**Meow*\* deeper and raspier than before. Repeatedly, it meowed over and over until finally it sounded demonic and not like anything else I had heard. I was paralyzed in fear, staring ahead blankly. Eye’s wide with terror, I felt a tear stream down my face, finally I degraded down to my deepest core beyond everything, I pleaded “Mom” “Mom please” “Mo-”. Then it started mimicking back, but in my mother's voice, “James,” “James, please,” “James”. My ears were ringing. I needed to get away, I needed this to stop. I turned around and leapt over the wooden fence through the woods. Darting through the woods as fast as I could, thorns were tearing at my clothes, ripping at my flesh, but it didn’t matter. I could hear her distantly, “James… James Please… Help”. I screamed, clawing at my head and ears while running. Suddenly, I felt my foot hit something too solid, and I tumbled forward into a tree. I tried to stand but felt my left leg snap entirely, and the bone pierced through my skin. I collapsed and was about to just lie there waiting to die. Then I heard it in the distance, but getting closer, “James… Please”. I forced myself on one leg and started limping. I desperately needed to get away.

I limped as long as I could until finally the trees seemed to end, and I found a clearing lit by moonlight. The full moon shined brighter than I had ever seen it. I couldn’t hear the voice anymore, but I didn’t stop. I tried with everything I had left to keep moving as far away from that voice as I could. My adrenaline ran out, and I collapsed. I started dragging myself across the ground, pulling at the tall grass desperately like a snail that was slowly bleeding out. A weak morsel of life desperate to succumb in any way to escape this, deep down, I’ve always felt this way about myself; this was just the true manifestation of it. I pulled and dragged myself as far as I could until my body gave out. Then I just stared through the tall grass in the moonlight, swaying with the cold wind as my vision started to fade into black. Tunneling inward, I felt it approaching, the inevitability of life that some fear and some yearn for. I wanted it desperately and closed my eyes, hoping to bring it closer. Then I heard Milo’s soft \**Meow*\* and I felt horror deep within me. I heard the little trot through the grass and felt his warm breath. He nudged his head against me as if asking me to look at him. I kept my eyes closed and refused to look, “P-please k-kill me,” I begged. Then I heard harsh cracking and popping, the breath went from warm and small to hot and forced with liquid spraying throughout. It let out heaving noises like nothing I’ve heard, creating an unholy symphony that painted the picture of an abomination. Eventually, it stopped and heard a deep bellowing call from it that shook the earth below me. I felt the rapid hot breathing again close to me, then it said, “**Look at me.”**

I forced my eyes closed, more desperate not look. It repeated “**LOOK AT ME,**” and I lay there in agony, slowly dying. In that moment, the one thing I wanted was for my mother's fate not have been this bad. I cried through my shut eyelids, begging for answers or a semblance of reassurance. Nothing came. I waited but refused to look, then I felt the bony appendages drag across my face towards my eyes. It was trying to pry them open. I tried to pull away, but it grabbed me and raised me into the air, holding me tight with an impossibly thin hand. I reached for my eyelids to claw them out, as it repeated for a final time, “**Look at me**”. I would do anything not look at it, and I started dragging my nail into my eye when I felt it. The hope I had longed for all these years, the reassurance of anything remotely close to my mother's peace, and the satisfaction of my own existence. I finally opened them with one eye bleeding and looked at the thing that had taken everything from the beautiful soul that was my mother. It was a devourer, to be feared, beyond any comprehension of possibility to isolate and consume. Though I felt something when I looked at it, this frail, disgusting husk of life looked weak, it was desperate, and it ultimately looked pathetic. It was smiling at me, gleeful. I finally looked at it, but the smile faded into scorn when I saw I wasn’t afraid. It grasped me tightly and threw me to the ground. I rolled, flailing, and felt sharp pain all over my body. Everything felt broken, and I could barely move my neck and right arm. It lowered itself to me, the thin, frail deer with human hands and feet. And grabbed my right arm, I was desperately trying to move and put it off cleanly at the wrist with immense force. “AAAGGGHHH,” I gurgled through blood filling my lungs. It grabbed me again, raising me to its face to look at it, smiling again. This time, blood leaking out of nearly every orifice I smiled back.

I felt pain and terror throughout my life; this was nothing new and nothing to fear at all. It was inevitable, its face twisted in rage, and it brought me as close to its face as it could to stare deep into me. I knew I was going to die, but for my mother and this life, whatever people could have cared for me if not for this force of malediction, I would resist. With the last remnants of life remaining, I plunged the bone sticking out of my right arm directly into its eye socket. I forced it into deeper thinking of everything it had done over and over again. “FUCK YOU,” I screamed rabidly while it whaled in agony for the first time in its miserable existence. It sounded as pitiful as it looked. It tried to pull me away with its inhuman strength, but I forced my arm deeper, ravaging its skull repeatedly until I could see its motor skills shutting down. It was shaking violently with rapid breathing, and I didn’t stop. I kept forcing my arm through anything inside. Until it dropped, still attempting to grasp me, trying to speak, giving off an immense hatred that I answered back with the same hate. I used my arm in its skull to pull me towards its frail neck and chewed like a wild animal repeatedly. Ripping off anything I could, even after it showed no sign of life. I gnawed and thrashed through it, sending blood everywhere. It felt warm, and it was the only true justice I’d ever known in my life. Then life faded away, and I felt myself drifting off with my arm in its skull and my head burrowed in the neck cavity I had created. Everything faded away until there was truly nothing; it was a peace and calm beyond any I had known. Stillness. Emptiness. End.

**Part Five**

In the distance of this stillness beyond the body, I saw a light; it reminded me of who I was and wanted to be. It approached as I did. I saw my lounging mother on a beach. I was standing with my ankles in the water; there was nothing wrong with me anymore. She looked so happy and pure. Behind her, I saw the house where she always wanted the waves to crash peacefully. Seagulls chirped with glee, and the island rang with a harmony I had yet to witness in my existence. My mother turned and noticed me. “JAMES! she exclaimed, waiving her hand in excitement. She spilled her drink and ran through the sand. She yelled again behind her, “James, look!”, and a man approached from the house. His jaw dropped, and he ran over, as fast as he could, somehow not spilling his drink. I knew him, and I didn’t even have to think about it anymore. That was my father, who got strung out on drugs and went missing some time after I was born. As they ran over, I saw tears in their eyes with an immense pride coursing through them. Everything was perfect. Then I heard sobbing in the distance behind me.

I turned and saw a woman leaning over someone wrapped in bandages with a morsel of a pulse. She was pleading for someone, “James, please. Edgar confessed. Please, James, wake up.” “I’m so sorry… I love you”. I looked back to my parents, and they had already stopped running. They stood there still beaming with pride and love greater than any I had felt in my life, but I knew and so did they. They just stood there smiling, and my mother was screaming how she loved me, trying to embarrass me in a place where shame didn’t exist. I smiled back, but I knew I had to go back; I wasn’t going to let someone plead for me again alone. As I turned back towards the sobbing woman walking away, I heard my father yell, “See you soon, son!” and they both waved, smiling. I walked towards the women with every ounce of strength I had left back into the darkness, away from the place I hoped to end up, but deep down, I know where I’m headed, and I won’t be alone this time.

She walks/skates around LA and Venice Beach all day talking and ranting about random stuff and hanging out with random people. She speaks really well though and even though none of her stuff makes any sense whatsoever, it clearly makes sense to her. I'm not sure if she's on any drugs but she's clearly mentally ill. She's gorgeous too so there's that. She is an interesting case study. We've only seen in a small glimpse of Britney's life, and from what I've seen of Daisy's they have some parallels. How do these people who are so mentally unwell take care of themselves? We never see them eating, engaging in any self-care, doing normal things like taking care of their children, shopping for themselves,, etc. They almost never sit still enough to enjoy a cop of coffee or marvel at a beautiful sky or delight in anything at all really.

Any advice whether learning or receipe guide would be great.

   Tldr:how good should a barista be at hot bar around the 3 month mark.

  

Hey guys so im a green bean and im about to reach the 3rd month mark of my hiring date. Ive been doing pretty good so far with most positions but ive been struggling with hot bar so i wanted some advice.In my opinion i think im doing ok but I just have a horrible trainer and needed some reference to how well i should be doing at hot bar for my current time as a barista.

I wanted to explain the situation about my training first. so overall the training for my first 2 weeks was good and the trainer for it was amazing but when it came to cold bar is where it began.my shift lead has been training me on cold bar decently early on and when I didnt instantly pick it up he got a little helicoptery. He would constantly quiz me mid drink which was distracting but i got the idea. what i didnt understand is that he said he would, as a test, lie to me about the recipe and say that i had to learn when he was lying. Example -him""hey that actually gets 4 pumps for that drink"". me-""o ok"" and then I'd do the extra pumps and he would get mad that i didnt know he was lying and I had to relearn cold bar because I could only remember his lie recipes. luckily it wasnt that hard because I kinda knew cold bar drinks as they are simple and its all ive ordered from Starbucks.

Hot bar is where the big problem is. It started normal with me being assigned a bar to share with a veteran and it went great, then once I got a rough idea they allowed me to use a tablet to quick search recipes for mobie order bar and do some simple drive thru orders early morning. being able to use the tablet only lasted 2 shifts (i think a solid 3 hours total since i wasnt only on bar) and after i was told I couldn't use the tablet anymore. I was told to simply ask the neighbor barista any questions and believe me I did because I hadn't gotten the receipts down.It took like 5 drink questions for the barista to obviously become annoyed and my lead to take me off bar. He pulled me to the side and asked how I learned best. I asked him for some more tablet time as i hadnt gotten the rythmn down yet and constantly seeing the receipe in my mind wiuld help me. He told me that no one learned that way and the tablet was off limits. Fast forward a couple weeks and I had a decent idea of hot bar, not enough to do drive but I could make do with mobile orders.Then I an order came in that I wasn't familiar with. A café misto. Admittedly I had learned it but I had only made it twice the whole time so I asked my fellow barista how to make it. she explained thats its half coffee from the vertica and half milk.It was a venti so I kinda guess with the vertica what would fill it half way. My lead found out, pulled me to the side and said ""look dude I've tried but im kinda done with this, you know how to make a misto, youve done it before"" I told him that it was once and  like a month ago and that I didnt even know there was a misto button on the vertica. He put me on warming station and went on break and proceeded to not talk to me the whole shift. I haven't done bar since which was 2 weeks ago. 

I feel so bad about not knowing bar fully even though i know its not fully my fault but i just wanted to know on average how good should i barista be at hot bar before the 3 month mark.",3,1768964662.0,starbucks,3,1.0,False

This year, my wife got really sick while pregnant, and we were in the process of moving, so I stopped working out and focused on the move.

Right after that, my first daughter was born kn October… then Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. The lack of time/sleep coupled with the holidays led me to eating a lot of quick and unhealthy meals via door dash or whatever, and a LOT of snacking on sweets. I weighed in on New Year’s Eve at 192. 

Starting New Year’s Day I have not snacked on anything. My wife and I made a commitment to cook more and are limiting ordering out to two meals per week. Aside from meals, the only thing I have is a protein shake with whey protein, ice, milk, a banana, and peanut butter. Lunch is yogurt and a kind granola bar almost every day. Breakfast smallest always 3 eggs and one piece of toast. I drink coffee with a splash of milk or water.

measuring our mornings in headlines,

we’ve never been but somehow feel responsible for.

Everything is urgent.

Everything is broken.

Everything wants a piece of us.

People are shouting past each other,

armed with opinions instead of listening,

drawing lines in the dirt and calling them truth,

forgetting there are real hearts

standing on both sides.

Some days it feels like caring is a liability,

like if you let yourself feel it all,

you’ll drown.

So we joke, we numb out,

we pretend we’re fine

while the weight quietly settles in our chests.

And still—

people love.

They make coffee for each other.

They hold doors.

They check in at 2 a.m.

They cry alone and show up anyway.

The chaos is real,

but so is the fact that we’re still here,

still choosing softness in a hard world,

still trying to be decent

when being cruel would be easier.

Maybe connection isn’t fixing everything.

Maybe it’s sitting in the mess together

and saying, yeah… I feel it too.

the noise dims,

the world steadies,

and we remember we’re not crazy—

we’re just human,

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

1qim39g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Citrus/comments/1qim39g/both_preserved_meyer_lemons_and_meyer_lemon/,Both Preserved Meyer Lemons and Meyer Lemon Marmalade turned out well -- what to do with an abundance of ripe (yellow) Bearrs limes?,"I've preserved and made marmalade from Meyer's lemons with success.   Ever since moving a couple of older Bearrs from root-bound pots to a large container they've gone gangbusters.    I'll freeze some juice (we drink a lot of Margaritas) and zest, but wondering about preserving them, and making marmalade - for the latter I have a bunch of Meyers I can add to the mix.   

I use preserved lemons in tangines etc, wondering what I'd do with preserved limes, any other cuisines or dishes?  

I have been a fan of marmalade since I was a kid so it's great to have enough for the year and to give away a bunch as well.   Never did lime marmalade but given ripe limes are mellower than unripe/green ones wonder if them alone is enough.   Anything to make the lime marmalade more interesting?  Jalepeños or other peppers?   Some chutney-like Mexican-ish concoction?  

I also make my own orange liqueur (again for Margies - orange peel steeped in vodka for a while, coffee-paper-filtered a few times, brandy and simple syrup added) and would consider something along the same lines, lemon/lime-a-cello but suitable for the cocktails.  

Anything else?  Again looking for long term storage.

1qilylu,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1qilylu/i_just_sharted_the_bed_with_my_boyfriend_sleeping/,I just sharted the bed with my boyfriend sleeping next to me. What to I do to avoid him finding out??,"So I'm in bed with my boyfriend sound asleep next to me, I'm scrolling on my phone and I feel I need to let a fart out. I've been a bit gassy tonight so I've been silently letting them out to avoid my stomach hurting but I don't need to poop yet. Or so I thought. I let one out then suddenly it turned into a watery shart without. any. warning. Immediately, I turned on my side to try to avoid more of it getting on the sheets and snuck out of bed and into the hall bathroom to wipe my ass. I dampened a dark towel I found on the floor and quietly walked back into the bedroom to try to clean up the shit spot and cover it up. I'm nowl laying back down frozen sitting on top of the towel hoping he wont smell it or notice anything unusual when he wakes up. He has to leave for work in the morning instead of working from home so I'm going to use that as my chance to clean everything but oh my god what do I do now. Do I get back up and keep on trying to rub the towel over the spot to clean it more or leave it there and lay on it all night to avoid him waking up with me moving around? Luckily he's a pretty deep sleeper so I could attempt again to sneakily clean it more. HELP. What would you do in this situation??

Update #1: just sprayed perfume on the towel and on the shart spot and around the bed. He's still sound asleep. Going to say I spilled wine on the sheets if he asks why I'm lying on a towel in the AM

Update #2: he's up and on his phone and drinking coffee. I asked him how he slept and he said he slept good. I personally can't smell any poopy smell so I don't think he can either. I think I'm in the clear and will be able to clean it without detection

Update #3: he just left for work and didn't seem suspicious at all. Now stripping the sheets and throwing them in the washer to get rid of the evidence 🙏🏼.

FINAL UPDATE: : the washer did its duty and the sheets are back on the bed, with no trace a silent struggle ever occurred. Luckily, the mattress underneath was left mostly unscathed aside from a small spot that was easy to clean. All is well!!!!!!  Was this post necessary? In hindsight, no, but I really just wanted a lil advice on how to approach the situation discreetly, as I didn't wanna disturb my boyfriend. Was NOT expecting this to blow up the way it did nor did I think it would amuse so many people but glad it gave some of you a laugh. I have made an appt with my doctor to see if it's something deeper health related as many of you suggested.

Thanks for the awards and advice friends!! May the rest of your weeks be shart free <3

LAST ANS FINAL UPDATE YALL: I just came clean to him about it and told him about me posting about it on Reddit. He found it funny and said he probably would've tried to clean it up quietly as well if he could. I read him some of the comments and we go a good laugh out of it.",2,1768963679.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
1qilycy,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1qilycy/nighttime_urination/,Nighttime urination,"Been through hell and back the last 4 months.  Multiple kidney stones (uric acid - yay lucky me!), four stents, one diy-removable stent, three general anesthesia surgeries, multiple UTIs, three bouts of sepsis, two week-long stays in ICU while pressors were administered to try and raise BP (see sepsis), twenty days in rehab after the first ICU stay, ten days in rehab after the second ICU stay, three ER visits, one bout of C-Diff along from the sepsis antibiotics, COVID  (thanks re-hab) at the same time as C-Diff, two ambulance rides and more fun than any one person deserves.

So, retired male with T2 diabetes with history of left kidney stones.  Currently on Tamsulosin (Flomax) and Hydrochlorothiazide (BP/diuretic) among several other.  I take the Hydrochlorothiazide in the morning and Flomax at lunch.

With uric acid stones one of the major treatments is to dilute the urine so it's less acidic by drinking large amounts of water.  My urologist told me to drink 3.5 liters per day with the aim of producing 2.5 liters of urine.  Our town water tastes like chlorine so we drink bottled water.  I average about three 16.9 ounces of water along with a 20 ounce coffee.  I usually add MIO water flavoring to my water. I'm willing to do almost anything to avoid more stones.

Since I started drinking so much water I find myself getting up every hour if not 45 minutes to urinate.  Needless to say I'm exhausted.  I then find myself falling asleep all day long.  I do try to cut the amount of water I drink after 8pm and usually go to bed at 11-12 at night.  I make multiple trips to the bathroom during the day but seem to be able to go two or more hours then.

Any tricks to get more sleep?  (It's not prostate as my PSA (just checked) was almost zero). What does everyone else do?  I tried keeping a urinal but that wasn't really any better.

1qilv7i,https://i.redd.it/uxdj2v3m6meg1.jpeg,Please help me save my african violet. It was a gift from a friend.,"Hi all, 

I am begging for any ideas of how to try to save this african violet. It was gifted to me years ago, and in the last few years has been looked after by a relative. 

It is summer in Australia, and a few weeks ago we had some very hot 40C degree (104F) days (used aircon inside but it was still hot). They said during this time it looked sad/like this, and the soil felt bone dry, so they watered it (in the saucer at the bottom of course). I worry they may have watered it too much. It was watered last week too. 

I found it today like this, and the soil today feels moist. They have now put it today on the coffee cup you see here in case it helps 'drain' it better - pot has holes in the bottom. 

I notice the outside leaves feel dry, and most are brown, but there are some green leaves in the middle. It is kept in a shady spot inside but now I wonder if there has been too little sunlight for it. 

If there is absolutely ANYTHING I can do, please suggest it. I am willing to try anything to revive it.... besides, I like a challenge. It has looked very wilted and sad before but has always stayed alive after, 6 years since I received it at this point. Throwing it out is not an option. I will be repotting it tonight but don't know what else to do. 

Thank you so much in advance.

1qilsxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1qilsxl/solo_trip_to_epic_review/,Solo Trip to Epic Review,"I'm a big theme park fan, and have been wanting to check out Epic since it opened, so I took a few days off for a spontaneous 4 day solo trip! I stayed at Helios, got the park-to-park ticket (had to pop over to Studios to say hi to ET), and purchased Express. I just got back yesterday, and have some (ok, a lot of) thoughts. I was able to do all the attractions except Fyre Drill (it was like 40 degrees outside, y'all), and tried a whole lot of the food. And I think I have some hot takes.

First though, I want to say that one of the absolute best parts of Epic Universe was the team members. Universal is clearly putting their best people over there, and it really seems like they are having a great time and enjoying themselves. I love that they call you ""traveler"" in Celestial Park, ""viking"" in Berk, etc., and it feels like they're really committing to it, not just following the script. The worker at the confectionery shop got super hyped talking about the macarons. The hostess at The Atlantic told me this whole story about their founder, Captain Fernando.  Their attitude and energy really made it special, even when it was super busy (and I'm sure quite stressful).

Secondly, here are my thoughts on all of the lands:

**Isle of Berk**

I don't have too much of an attachment to this IP, but the land was beautiful; they really nailed the aesthetic. Based on the Youtube videos I watched, I expected to see some characters around the land (I didn't see any roaming characters over my 4 days), and more movement (all of the dragons around the land were static except for the babies fighting over the fish at the land entrance).

*Attractions*

The Untrainable Dragon: This show was so good! The singing, dancing, and puppetry(?) was impressive, I loved the costumes and sets (great use of screens here IMO), and OMG >!Toothless flying over the audience was a jaw-dropping magical moment. !<The dialogue was not great, and the acting was mostly just shouting (Gobber) or whining (Hiccup) at the audience, but 1. it's for kids, and 2. the show is more about the spectacle anyway, so it didn't really bother me.

Hiccup's Wing Gliders: I was excited for this one, and I liked it, but wasn't blown away. I would have liked at least one of the following: 1. more to look at, 2. more of a plot, 3. more thrills. It also went down multiple times throughout my trip.

Dragon Racer's Rally: I almost didn't ride this one because it doesn't have Express, and the wait time was consistently 45 minutes or more. BUT, on my very last night in the park, after being down for most of the day, it reopened around 9pm with a 15 minute wait, and I hopped in line. I really liked the aesthetic of the wings and the tactile aspect of controlling them. However, I didn't really get the hang of how to make them tilt/roll, so I was basically just going with the flow of the ride. It was over really fast!

*Dining*

Mead Hall: I got the Nordic fries here, and I liked the seasoning (I think it was mostly dill, salt, maybe a little sugar?), but the fries themselves were too thick and potato-y for my preference (it's gotta be at least a little crispy to be worth the calories imo). I also wish they would have come with a dipping sauce other than ketchup. I think a mayo or yogurt-based sauce would have complemented the dill seasoning better. I mostly wanted to come here for the vibes, but it was actually quite dark and dingy-feeling, and you couldn't really see the decor. I probably wouldn't go back to this one; it looks better in pictures and the menu wasn't really inspiring to me.

Spit Fyre Grill: I was so excited to try the PB&J mac and cheese cone, but it was maybe the worst thing I ate at Epic. The bread cone was completely saturated in oil. Like soaked. The mac and cheese itself was inoffensive, as was the pork. I had to toss this one after a few bites.

**Ministry of Magic**

https://preview.redd.it/a1n1iqoe2meg1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a656e1d3647d90050bd47dfbbe84a376b2c7cc45

Again, this land was beautiful. Everywhere you look, you find something charming to catch your eye. The window displays (both those with magical elements and without) are so intricate that you could easily spend an hour just taking them in. I did see a few characters here and there (some wizard/witch students ran down the street, looking like they were on their way to get up to some shenanigans, and a trio of jazz musicians played a few songs). There was also a guy in 1920s getup leaning in a doorway and looking nefarious, but I'm not sure if he was a character or just a spiffy dresser with a scowl. I was too shy to engage.

*Attractions*

BATM: The queue is a 10/10 but the ride was so underwhelming. It also made me quite ill, and I'm not usually prone to motion sickness. It was A LOT of screens, and at times projections on 3D sets (I think?), but I wouldn't say the visuals were great. It also moved pretty fast and it was hard to focus on them. And the plot was simultaneously simplistic and nonsensical. I'm still not entirely sure >!how Umbridge escaped (how did Yaxley end up in the elevator with her?) OR how she was caught again. But yeah, that's basically the whole thing, she escapes custody, tries to get a time turner, fails to do so, and then is caught again. !<Also I feel like there wasn't a need to do the whole floo/time turner thing to end up at the UK ministry in the 90s, they could have done a really cool ride based in the French ministry (maybe with Grindlewald), or something awesome with going into Newt's briefcase and encountering all of his fantastic beasts. Speaking of...

Le Cirque Arcanus: This one was a bit disappointing. The queue was intriguing, and the preshow was a really exciting setup. When >!the demiguise came out of the briefcase!<, I gasped. I was ready to be amazed. For the main show, the visuals were amazing start to finish >!(except for Newt, he looked pretty bad on the screen and did not blend with the practical sets), !<the magical creatures were truly stunning. But the acting from the main girl was so terrible that it really took me out, and the conflict/climax was super rushed and completely unsatisfying. I don't mind if a theme park show is goofy or childish, but come on >!Newt just popped up out of nowhere and hit him with ""expelliarmus,"" and the girl just...pushes him into the closet?

Le Cafe de l'air de la Sirene: Needlessly long name. Gorgeous restaurant. I got pumpkin juice (I LOVE pumpkin juice, it's a 1000/10, must get, just the best), hot butterbeer (too sweet to finish, but it's a classic that hits just right for the first like, 3 sips), and the Parisian crepe, which had turkey, brie, apples, mornay sauce, and an egg. I enjoyed the crepe, but most of the ingredients were quite bland, like someone only added half a flavor packet to everything. The turkey was super flavorful and delicious, but after a few bites I started noticing the texture from the apple and brie, but very very little flavor. I thought maybe the turkey was just overshadowing them, so I had a bite of them on their own, and they were still very bland. Just a hint of apple flavor was present, and absolutely no brie flavor. I know brie is a mild cheese, but this brie really had no taste. Same with the mornay sauce. Even the egg didn't really taste very eggy. I still enjoyed it, but that was super weird. I also love that the restaurant is huge; it can accommodate soooo many parties but doesn't feel crowded.

Le Gobelet Noir: This one was so good! Too bad it closes at 6, because I would have liked to have gone back to try a few more things, but I kept missing it. When I did make it, I had the shaved beef sandwich with a side salad (I wasn't trying to mess with those thick fries again), and it was probably my favorite thing I ate at Epic. I will say that this sandwich came with butterkase cheese and German mustard, but honestly I couldn't taste either of them (I promise, I'm not the kind of person that needs everything to be overseasoned, I don't mind subtle flavors, but these were just nonexistent). I didn't mind too much because the corned beef and the toasty bread were delicious. The vibes were also fantastic. There were a few different small-ish rooms, so even though it was a fairly large space, it still felt cozy, with lightly spooky decor.

**Dark Universe**

My cold, black, goth heart was so perfectly at home in this land. Especially when it was cold, cloudy, and windy this weekend. Frankenstein's manor was just gorgeous. I loved the burning windmill. The fog coming out of the ground was \*chef's kiss.\* I do wish there was more areas to just wander around and take in the atmosphere. I think it would be awesome to create some spaces kind of like Knockturn Alley, where it's constantly dark, and you can walk down the alley, look into shop windows with some creepy stuff going on, maybe have a few smaller themed specialty shops (like maybe a pie shop that's kind of like Mrs. Lovett's from Sweeney Todd, maybe an occult/magic shop where you can get talismans and tarot cards and crystal balls, maybe a ""rare book shop"" that doesn't actually sell anything, but it's like a place you can stop in, enjoy the ambience, sit in an armchair, maybe have a meet and greet or a storyteller read from the ancient texts, etc)

*Attractions*

Monsters Unchained: I've only heard rave reviews for this ride, and I love horror/monsters, so I was ready to love this one. But I kind of didn't. The visuals on the queue and the ride were a delight, but the preshow and the ride just didn't make any sense. What even was the experiment? She wanted Dracula under her control, but what does that mean, is it like mind control? Is it just that she has physically contained him? Also, how does he escape? How do all the other monsters escape? I guess >!they kill him by reflecting sunlight with a mirror, but where is the sunlight coming from? And also, all of the other monsters are still out of their cages, right? So it's not even resolved. !<And who are we? Igor calls us ""lab rats,"" and then makes a comment like ""oh don't worry, you're definitely not the experiment..."" sooooo are they trying to experiment on us? What are they doing to us? I rode this a bunch of times, and asked team members to clarify what's going on, but I'm still unclear. They said to pay close attention to the preshow, and the dialogue in the ride, but that made me more confused.

Here's one way the story could have gone: Dr. Victoria is trying to clear her family's name and improve her reputation by opening her house/lab to the public, to show them that she's actually doing a public service by containing these monsters. She shares this information with us during the preshow, Igor maybe does a little demonstration to show us how she keeps these monsters contained in their cells with no risk to the public, and then directs one of her lab assistants (it would be cool if this was a live performer, but it could also be a video/projection) to take us on the tour. Once Dr. Victoria and Igor are gone, the lab assistant reveals that she's actually one of Dracula's familiars and we're going to help her set him free. Once we're down in the catacombs, she lets out a bunch of the lesser monsters (perhaps blaming it on Igor not locking them up correctly), creating a distraction because Dr. Victoria and Igor have to focus on making sure they don't kill us, and the familiar now has an opening to set Dracula free. We have a lot of close calls with all of the loose monsters. Finally, Dracula's free, and he's like oh, thank you familiar for bringing me all these delicious humans to feast on! And the familiar is like no no, these are my friends, they helped set you free, you can't eat them, but he doesn't care, he lunges for us. Frankenstein jumps in at this point to save us, and the familiar gets us out of there in the nick of time. But, the damage is done, all the monsters have been released. And they're all lurking around the village of Darkmoor! Watch out, you may just run into one of them out in the shadows...

Curse of the Werewolf: This was actually so fun, but so short! And really not themed at all. I saw someone on Youtube (I can't remember who) suggest that this should be an indoor coaster, so it can always take place in a dark forest. I think this would be great, and you could also add some visuals and sounds to make it feel like you're being chased by werewolves.

*Dining*

Das Stakehouse: I had the lobotocotta, a brain-shaped panna cotta covered in raspberry ""blood,"" which was so fun, and super delicious. The decor was fun here, but like Mead Hall, it looked better in pictures/videos. There was also a long wait for a table, but that could have been because it was raining when I went.

Burning Blade Tavern: I didn't like this one. Again, it looks much better on camera. I wanted to enjoy the atmosphere with a little beverage, but there is very little seating, and very little to look at (like, a couple of Halloween mask-looking ""monster heads"" hung up behind the bar and that's it). I got the My Only Weakness cocktail on the bartender's recommendation, and it was kind of sickly sweet, and not really themed at all. I think this place would be awesome if there were a lot of dark corners to sit in, booths, stools at the bar, lots of decor (weapons, wanted posters, souvenirs from monster kills, how to protect yourself against monsters or how to identify monsters posters, etc), themed drinks in themed cups/mugs (I don't want to take home a souvenir mug, but I looooove drinking out of a themed cup and then giving it back when I'm done). I honestly wouldn't mind the fact that the cocktail wasn't the best if I was drinking it out of a skull or dragon egg or something. It would be even better if there was a bit of theater when the drinks are delivered (like a blowtorch to finish it off, or a zap of electricity to ""activate"" it, etc), or a story behind each one (this one is an antidote to werewolf bites, this one gives you immunity to mind-readers). I also wouldn't mind if they kept the bar as is, but added on a reservations-only speakeasy in the basement or attic or back room where they do the cool stuff I mentioned. Maybe in the speakeasy there could also be a show that you could watch while drinking your beverages...like an it's a meeting of the guild of monster hunters or something. You can chat casually with the local monster hunters for a little bit, then someone starts the meeting and does a monologue about how the guild came about or something, and then someone interrupts because oh no, we just got word that someone here tonight is secretly a vampire or werewolf or something, and we have to figure out who it is, and it's like a murder mystery dinner but cocktails and snacks.

**Super Nintendo**

This land was so fun and nostalgic! There was so much movement everywhere, bright colors, energizing music, and interactivity all over the place. I actually visited the Super Nintendo Land in Hollywood (and this was pretty much identical, plus the Yoshi ride), and got a power up band while I was there, but I forgot to bring it with me this time :( And I refused to buy another one, so I didn't do any of the little games. But just having all of the games happening all around really added to the atmosphere. I do think it is a huge fumble to not have a rainbow road rollercoaster! I'm sure I'm not the first one to suggest that, but dude it's right there.

*Attractions*

Mario Kart: This one didn't blow my mind, but I don't really love video game rides in general. The visuals in the queue and on the ride were really great, you totally felt like you were inside the game. I like the idea of the augmented reality, but I felt like it was kind of distracting from the practical sets, which I found a lot more charming.

Yoshi's Adventure: Such a cute ride, and a fun way to view the land. The queue was also super cute. I wouldn't say this was super amazing, but I enjoyed it and would ride again!

Mine Cart Madness: My favorite Nintendo ride, but I definitely don't think it warrants the near constand 150+ minute wait time! I went on after 9pm with Express almost every night, and it was always a walk on. The ride was a bit jerky, but that makes sense for the theming. The queue could be more interesting, but like I said, that wasn't an issue with Express.

*Dining*

I actually didn't eat anything in this land. I was going to pop into Toad's for the question box tiramisu, but the line was super long so I bailed. I did eat a bunch of stuff at the Hollywood location, and enjoyed all of it!

**Celestial Park**

https://preview.redd.it/eab67ypn2meg1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb9da69a5e66a8ff5d2f8906ad2e44805424bc81

Literally the best thing about Epic is Celestial Park at nighttime. The lights, the music, the sparkles, the water features all came together, inspiring a sense of wonder and awe in me that really brought me back to how theme parks used to make me feel when I was a child. I do wish there were more attractions in Celestial Park (I've heard people suggest a Captain Cacao dark ride, I would also love a planetarium-style show), and I also think the visuals are a bit underwhelming in the daytime. Also, you can very clearly see buildings and sets from the other lands from inside Celestial Park. I know people aren't as picky about sightlines these days, but this is pretty egregious. It totally ruins the idea that you're traveling through a portal to another place. Also, they had live bands playing pop songs in this band shell in the middle of Celestial Park, but they were also playing the theme music for the land at the same time, and both were super loud and super clashy. I like the idea of live music, but I would prefer if it was themed to the land in some way rather than Earth pop songs, and it's just so weird that they're playing the land theme music at the same time in the same place at the same volume.

*Attractions*

Constellation Carousel: Um, is this my favorite ride in the park?? The vibes are stellar (pun intended), the visuals are stunning, and the music is gorgeous. They also have a variety of different songs that you can get while you ride, so you're not going crazy listening to the same song over and over while you're in line. At nighttime, this ride goes hard. It's amazing. And the costumes that the team members wear at the carousel are elite. I would buy that shirt. And maybe the pants. Definitely the boots.

Stardust Racers: Ok, THIS is actually my favorite ride in the park! Definitely my favorite coaster at Universal. It was great both during the day and at night, but watching this one at night is amazing. It really does look like shooting stars whooshing through the sky. This is also a long coaster, it's definitely a satisfying ride. It was down for almost a whole day of my trip, but I was able to ride it a bunch of times while it was running, because the wait time was never very long.

D*ining*

Oak and Star: I got the bruleed mango bread and I am still upset. There was not a whisper of mango or mango flavor to be found. This was a piece of plain sponge cake, with toasted coconut (which added texture but weirdly no coconut flavor) on top, and some cream and fruit (strawberry and pineapple, no mango!) on the side. It wasn't bad, but I would not have ordered it if I had known that's what it was. I did like the atmosphere here but it didn't make up for the false advertising of the menu.

Meteor Astropub: I fell victim to false advertising here as well. I ordered the gochujang beer-battered fish and chips with a kimchi remoulade sauce. There was not even a suggestion of gochujang anywhere in this dish. The remoulade kind of had a slight whiff of cabbage flavor, but no kimchi. The fish itself was  pretty good, but a little bit overdone. The chips were the same fries as everywhere else in the park. There is also really no theming on the inside. I wouldn't go back here.

The Atlantic: The menu here wasn't too enticing to me (who the heck is ordering a $50 half pound lobster roll??), but I really wanted to try it because of the gorgeous atmosphere, and because I like to have a sit down reservation every day to have a designated time and place to rest and refuel in a climate controlled space. I ordered the tuna tartare, and I enjoyed it, but it was VERY salty. It's a good thing that it was a small portion, because I don't think I could have had another bite of that salt bomb. I also got the ""el pulpo"" for dessert, which is (allegedly) cheesecake shaped like octopus tentacles with pistachio sponge cake. On paper, I should have loved this dessert: I love cheesecake, I love pistachio, and I love novelty/aesthetically fun foods. However, this was completely tasteless. The cheesecake literally tasted like nothing, it wasn't even sweet. The pistachio cake did have a bit of pistachio flavor, but the texture was kind of off-putting. I loved the ambiance so much though that I came back the next day just to sit at the bar with a glass of wine.

Pizza Moon: I was surprised by how much I liked this! I got the pizza lunare, mostly for the novelty of the purple ube crust, but it turned out to be actually delicious. The crust was bright purple, but it didn't have a super ube taste, just a slightly earthy undertone. The texture of the crust was also a great combination of crispy and chewy. The mix of ricotta, panchetta, and confit garlic was divine. I took half of it back to my room at Helios, and it was also great as a cold midnight snack! The atmosphere here is also delightful. I would go back to just have a beer and watch the 2D cutouts of vaudevillians with pizza ingredients swing from the ceiling.

The Blue Dragon: This was probably my favorite restaurant in the park because of the combination of being able to make a reservation (I love the certainty of knowing that a table will be ready for me), the gorgeous visuals, the fantastic service, and the solid food. I loved the neon signs all over the walls and ceiling. It felt calm, quiet, and comfortable. I came here at the very end of the night, and I had been eating all day, so I wasn't able to order a ton here, but I ended up getting the soup dumplings at the server's suggestion. These weren't like out of this world or anything, but they were yummy, comforting, and familiar. A perfect way to end a chilly day.

Frosty Moon: I love soft serve, and I'm always excited when you can order soft serve flavors other than vanilla and chocolate! I tried the cheesecake flavor, and I have to say, I was underwhelmed. It had a slightly tangy aftertaste, but the initial flavor just kind of tasted like ice, it wasn't even creamy, and it definitely wasn't cheesecake-y. It looked adorable with the gold star sprinkles, though!

Star Siu Bao: I got two things from this stand: the tteokbokki skewer, and the kimchi bao. The skewers are in contention with the mac and cheese cone for the worst thing I ate at epic. This one may have been my fault though, I just skimmed the menu, saw tteokbokki skewer, and ordered it without reading the description too closely, assuming that I've had tteokbokki skewers before, so I knew generally what I was getting. Whelp. There were two plain rice cakes on the skewer, in between three fat pieces of hot dog, and wrapped in a thick cheese skirt. I like rice cakes (although I feel like they should have had sauce on them), I like hot dogs, and I like cheese skirts, but these three things did NOT go together well at all. It was gross. The kimchi bao on the other hand, was the bomb. The bao buns were soft and fluffy, and they had crispy chicken and pickled veggies in a sweet and sour sauce. I could not find any kimchi. But I loved it anyway!

**Helios Grand Hotel**

I absolutely loved staying here. It was SO convenient to wake up and walk straight into the park, and even more convenient to be able to pop back to the room to grab an extra layer when it got cold, or to drop off merch I bought, or to have a quick lie down when I got tired. All of the team members here were totally welcoming and helpful. It was expensive as hell though!

I also LOVED Bar Helios! I sat at the window and had an amazing view of the park at night. Both cocktails I tried (the Athenian Milk Punch and the Clash of the Titans) were so fantastic, complex, and surprising. I also tried the amazing patatas bravas (I think they stole all the crispiness from the park fries to use on these potatoes), and the very OK savory tuna cannoli (ironic that the cannoli shell was actually sweet, and the tuna was neutral, soooo I wouldn't really call it savory lol).

**Overall Thoughts**

Highlights

* The team members
* The visuals!!!
* Stardust Racers and Constellation Carousel
* Nighttime
* The Blue Dragon
* Pizza Moon
* The Untrainable Dragon

Nitpicks

* A lot of the food being bland
* The lack of attention to sightlines
* Nonsensical, confusing, or overly simplistic plots of some rides and shows
* Would have liked to see more characters/streetmasphere
* Lack of iced coffee or cold brew!!!
* Editing to add one more: it does bother me that the Celestians worship the Greek gods when they're not Greek, or even from Earth. And also it's weird that the portal is called the ""Chronos"" when Chronos is the god of time. Seems like it might make more sense to call it something related to Hermes, the god of travelers.

Here’s my current setup and how I use each card:

**Chase Freedom (12,757 points) - oldest credit card probably 13+ years old**

– Used only for Amazon purchases

– Mainly to keep Amazon spending separate for budgeting and tracking

– I know this isn’t always optimal for points, but it helps me understand my Amazon spend

**Chase Freedom Unlimited (28,885 points)**

– Day-to-day spending

– Groceries, shopping, kids activities, miscellaneous expenses

**Chase Sapphire Preferred (358,143 points)**

– Regular dining/ coffee

– Smaller travel expenses like gas and tolls

**Chase Ink Business Unlimited (128,872 points)**

– All business expenses that allow a credit card instead of ACH payment

– Chosen mainly for the 0% APR for 12 months

– Recently opened, haven’t fully optimized yet

– Travel at least once a month for business for a few days which entails flight + hotel + car rental

**Capital One Venture X (490,517 points)**

– Major personal travel (flights, hotels, car rentals)

– Large life expenses (car tires, furniture, kids’ school/swimming, utilities, etc.)

– More expensive dinners / eating out

**For points strategy:**

– I usually pool all personal Chase points into the Sapphire Preferred for Ultimate Rewards

– I haven’t redeemed yet, just accumulating

– I recently got the Ink Business card and plan to pool those points as well

**Preferences / notes:**

– No strong airline or hotel brand loyalty

– I usually book whatever is most convenient and cost-effective

1qilrde,https://thesciencesurvey.com/features/2026/01/07/the-forest-is-losing-its-roots-how-chain-stores-are-reshaping-forest-hills/,The Forest is Losing Its Roots: How Chain Stores Are Reshaping Forest Hills,"This article touches on something I keep seeing—more chains that everyone complains about but they're always full. If we don't want more chains, we need to stop spending our money there, it's that simple. 

For those who don't want to click:

>A deeper dive into the changing retail environment in Forest Hills, where it seems that chains are taking over and pushing smaller retailers out.

>Despite being a part of the city that “never sleeps,” Forest Hills, a smaller neighborhood in Queens, is almost the exact opposite. Inside the suburb of Forest Hills, life is quiet, peaceful, and serene. The rustling of leaves under one’s feet and the song of birds in the trees above them are often the only sounds around. Trees and Tudor-style architecture line each street, creating a unique, almost pastoral atmosphere within the bustling city of New York. Another unique aspect of Forest Hills is that even the less residential, retail-focused streets exhibit the same kind of small-town vibe. Forest Hills is home to a diverse retail environment featuring a plethora of smaller, mom-and-pop businesses, unlike other places in New York City where only larger, chain corporations exist. Small businesses like cozy cafes, artisanal bakeries, and locally-owned boutiques are what make up Forest Hills’ distinct personality and charm. However, the storefront diversity that has been such a defining feature of Forest Hills is rapidly deteriorating.

>Over the past year alone, fast-food restaurants and chain coffee shops have been popping up all over the main retail street in Forest Hills, Austin Street. Places such as Chick-fil-A, Sweetgreen, and Raising Cane may seem like appealing new lunch spots, but their openings often displace or even shut down smaller businesses and restaurants. As rents increase and landlords prefer tenants with more financial stability, many beloved local spots are being pushed out. In January of 2023, the local marketplace on Austin Street, Cheese of the World, closed down after 65 years in business. Just soon after, the storefront was taken over by SoBol, a chain açaí bowl and smoothie shop, in February of last year. To many Forest Hills residents, the shutting down of small businesses diminishes the appeal of their neighborhood. Due to the skyrocketing number of corporate retailers, to many residents, Austin Street is beginning to feel less like an escape from the dominance of chains and more like an extension of it.

>In the past few years, the commercial landscape of Forest Hills has undergone a noticeable transformation. Global bakery chains such as Paris Baguette and Tous les Jours have opened stores, directly competing with longtime small businesses in the neighborhood like La Boulangerie and Martha’s Bakery. Coffee chains such as Gregory’s Coffee and Moka & Co have come in, putting pressure on local cafes like Red Pipe and Pink Forest. New fast food restaurants like Raising Cane, 7th Street Burger, and Chick-fil-A challenge existing local restaurants like Station House and Dirty Pierre’s. When chains like those previously mentioned enter the neighborhood, the difficult competition they bring creates an existential threat for small businesses. John Angelis, the son of Nick, founder of the local institution, Nick’s Pizza on Austin Street, shared a recent example of this impact. “A few weeks ago, when the Chick-Fil-A opened, we were slower for lunch for a few days,” he said, reflecting on how quickly customer traffic can shift. While fluctuations in customer traffic may be temporary, they give residents insight into the deeper problem: the recent appearance of so many new chains is a danger to the existence of many small businesses in Forest Hills.

>In general, small businesses struggle to stay afloat. They put large amounts of  money back into their enterprise and they tend to have extremely thin profit margins. Unexpected slow periods and sudden rent hikes can be devastating for these stores. In a sample of small businesses in New York City, [nearly 1 in every 4 report that they plan to or may close within the next year](https://www.anhd.org/report/state-storefronts-2023-beyond-recovery/). In Forest Hills, the struggles local businesses face are being exacerbated. The increase in chain stores has made it considerably more difficult for small businesses to stay alive. In Council District 29, where Forest Hills lies, rent has increased by [8.3% between 2019 and 2022](https://www.anhd.org/report/change-nyc-storefront-rents-2019-2022/). This number may seem insignificant, but to many local businesses it’s the difference between staying open or closing.

>However, an increase in rent due to the presence of chains isn’t the only thing that could drive a small business to closure. François Danielo, the owner of the French bakery on Austin Street, La Boulangerie de François, has a different idea as to why small businesses aren’t able to survive in general. As a small business owner himself, he’s had plenty of firsthand experience dealing with the multitude of complications that small businesses face. Danielo says that small businesses are almost constantly in a “survival mode,” especially when the city is constantly imposing complicated forms to fill out, regulations to meet, and expensive fees to pay. He said that the city government, despite its good intentions, doesn’t fully understand the burden it is putting on small businesses. Oftentimes, larger corporations like chains are better equipped to deal with government regulations because they have lawyers on staff who are trained and hired specifically to deal with these issues. Small businesses, on the other hand, have no lawyers to deal with these regulations, forcing the business owners themselves to have to take care of them, sacrificing precious time that otherwise would be dedicated to running their business and focusing on making it more profitable.

>Danielo mentioned that he purchased a char broiler, a cooking appliance similar to a grill, with the intention of expanding his business to offer more lunch options. After he installed it, he was approached by the Department of Environmental Protection who were seeking to examine the sustainability of his char broiler. He exclaimed that “they came with a three page form asking me to fill up to explain what my char broiler does, the brand, if I have an emission control device.” He then said that, “They really don’t make it easy. If you have a big business, you have lawyers, you don’t even do that yourself.” Instead of the char broiler expanding his offerings, it ended up taking focus away, not just from his menu, but from his business as a whole. In François Danielo’s experience, chains aren’t the sole factor pushing local businesses to termination, unreasonable and excessive rules set in place by the city government also nudge small businesses closer to closure.

>Nevertheless, the owner of La Boulangerie’s opinion is one of many small businesses’ experiences with the impact of chains. Other businesses, like Shai’s Salon, have faced enormous rent increases due to the increasing presence of chain stores in Forest Hills, so much so that they were forced to move to a different location in the neighborhood where the rents were cheaper–unsurprisingly, a street with less chain competition. Shai Asayag, the owner of the salon, told me that in the beginning of their 25 year lease, when they were located near Austin Street, their rent started off at $2,500. Each year of their lease, the rent increased by 4%. After 25 years, the rent reached a price of around $8,000, more than three times the original rent. When Asayag went to renew the lease, the landlord asked for almost double the rent, a price that the salon could simply not afford. Heartbreakingly, Asayag was forced to move his salon to a street with more affordable rent. Asayag said that now, it is “much harder” for small businesses to survive on Austin Street because “a lot of the big chains are coming and they have big money.” He also reflected on how they are “ruinous for small businesses” and that “it’s impossible to make your business” when there are so many larger businesses coming in.

>While these new and seemingly exciting chains may appeal to others, most residents of Forest Hills don’t approve of them. Jessica Santos, longtime supporter and hostess of 5 Burro Cafe on Austin street, as well as a Forest Hills native, noted that “it has been kind of frustrating seeing the same stores over and over again, and watching Forest Hills lose that diversity.” The general consensus among residents is that chain corporations are destroying the diverse retail environment that is a defining feature of Forest Hills.

>Ultimately, the struggles faced by mom and pop businesses in Forest Hills reflect a larger issue infiltrating the entire city of New York. All across the city, name-brand stores are popping up, pushing out native businesses. Residents across the city are at a crossroads between preserving character, or giving into convenience. Without meaningful support from residents, not only do many small businesses face the prospect of closure, but the neighborhood of Forest Hills, along with the city as a whole, risk fading into the façade of corporate monotony.",27,1768963138.0,ForestHills,3,0.97,False

I was really looking forward to it.    
  
My dad had been all alone in the house for a week while my mom and younger sisters were in Europe.  My mom had even sent their dog to a dog-sitter for the week!

On Saturday morning my dad asked me for a favor - I drove 52 miles round trip to pick him up after he dropped off his car at the tire shop. Then we went to a breakfast at a place he chose - that neither of us has been to before.

At breakfast, my dad was increasingly uncomfortable.  He wasn't happy with the unhealthy menu, he didn't like the coffee, the service was slow and awkward.  He was probably feeling lonely in the empty house.  Then he began criticizing my lack of a career.   
  
And look, he's not wrong to be disappointed in my lack of adult success.  I took 10 years to finish college and haven't managed to get a traditional job since graduating 5 years ago.  I'm overweight (working on it) and have long hair and a beard (intentional) - he can't stand any of it.  

Anyway, my dad asked what my plans were for making more money this year. I said honestly that if I knew, I'd have done it already, and asked if we could move on. He ignored this and asked if I wanted him to pay for therapy, and if I'd ""given up on ever having a job."" I said no to both and again asked to change the subject.

He kept going - asked if I wanted to be a lawyer, suggested I'd need to cut my hair, asked if I'd talked to anyone about ""this.""  Then he brought up paying for me to go to therapy, again. At this point, I told him he was crossing a line that would be relationship-ending with a friend. He ignored me and continued.

I stood up and said ""I'm going, and I'm not going to the rodeo tonight."" As I was leaving, he asked ""Aren't you going to drive me home?"" I'd forgotten I was his ride, but I was already walking out, so I said ""are you kidding?"" and left.

Important context: We had this EXACT conversation 2 months ago where I told him that suggesting I need therapy when I'm not asking for it is a personal attack I'm not okay with - and he promised to stop bringing it up.  I've actually been to a good amount of therapy over the years - so I'm not opposed to the idea on principle.  But there's a difference between going to therapy and being told you need it.  

He later texted asking if he should resell the rodeo tickets. I explained I'd asked him to stop at least 3 times and that he couldn't have expected me to sit through more. He responded: ""I don't know why you set lines. The person who sets lines in the sand is often hostile."" Then immediately asked if I could drive him to pick up my mom's car.

AITA? I feel bad about missing the evening I was looking forward to, but I don't think I should have to sit through being told I need therapy and have ""given up on life"" after explicitly asking someone to stop - even if that person is my dad.",2,1768962923.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.63,False

So I'm in bed with my boyfriend sound asleep next to me, I'm scrolling on my phone and I feel I need to let a fart out. I've been a bit gassy tonight so I've been silently letting them out to avoid my stomach hurting but I don't need to poop yet. Or so I thought. I let one out then suddenly it turned into a watery shart without. any. warning. Immediately, I turned on my side to try to avoid more of it getting on the sheets and snuck out of bed and into the hall bathroom to wipe my ass. I dampened a dark towel I found on the floor and quietly walked back into the bedroom to try to clean up the shit spot and cover it up. I'm nowl laying back down frozen sitting on top of the towel hoping he wont smell it or notice anything unusual when he wakes up. He has to leave for work in the morning instead of working from home so I'm going to use that as my chance to clean everything but oh my god what do I do now. Do I get back up and keep on trying to rub the towel over the spot to clean it more or leave it there and lay on it all night to avoid him waking up with me moving around? Luckily he's a pretty deep sleeper so I could attempt again to sneakily clean it more. HELP. What would you do in this situation??

Update #1: just sprayed perfume on the towel and on the shart spot and around the bed. He's still sound asleep. Going to say I spilled wine on the sheets if he asks why I'm lying on a towel in the AM

Update #2: he's up and on his phone and drinking coffee. I asked him how he slept and he said he slept good. I personally can't smell any poopy smell so I don't think he can either. I think I'm in the clear and will be able to clean it without detection

Update #3: he just left for work and didn't seem suspicious at all. Now stripping the sheets and throwing them in the washer to get rid of the evidence 🙏🏼.

FINAL UPDATE: : the washer did its duty and the sheets are back on the bed, with no trace a silent struggle ever occurred. Luckily, the mattress underneath was left mostly unscathed aside from a small spot that was easy to clean. All is well!!!!!!  Was this post necessary? In hindsight, no, but I really just wanted a lil advice on how to approach the situation discreetly, as I didn't wanna disturb my boyfriend. Was NOT expecting this to blow up the way it did nor did I think it would amuse so many people but glad it gave some of you a laugh. I have made an appt with my doctor to see if it's something deeper health related as many of you suggested.

Thanks for the awards and advice friends!! May the rest of your weeks be shart free <3

LAST ANS FINAL UPDATE YALL: I just came clean to him about it and told him about me posting about it on Reddit. He found it funny and said he probably would've tried to clean it up quietly as well if he could. I read him some of the comments and we go a good laugh out of it.",0,1768962915.0,whatdoIdo,4,0.4,False

It’s been absolutely horrible for me, i struggle to get to school or work on time, I don’t have as much time to get my chores/homework done and I spend less time with my partner (early sleeper/early riser).

I realize that the two major contributors as to why I sleep in so much is: a) i take my sleeping/depression medication too late at night, b) I get stressed out thinking about the things I need to get done that day. The medication time was an easier fix, I just got into the habit of remembering to take my meds earlier in the evening. But my bigger issues is the morning stress. 

If I wake up before my partner, my dog will immediately start barking for a walk. Like for however long it takes for me to get ready. My dog doesn’t understand it’s difficult for me to walk her if I didn’t pee or eat beforehand so she will bark almost nonstop until i get out the door. I can’t really do much about it honestly, because she is herding/barky breed, so this is what she’s built for. I don’t mind walking her because once we are out the door she’s very quiet and relaxed so the walk is pretty peaceful, but getting to that point is so overstimulating.

If I wake up after my partner, they are so gracious and they will have already walked the dog by the time I usually get up (I am so thankful). But afterwards, they will tell me what chores i need to do, complain about what I forgot to do the day before, ask me questions about stressful things, etc. It overwhelming to hear in the morning, but I know it needs to be done and honestly they are trying to offload the mental load of managing that stuff for us. 

I think the stress about dealing with all of that stuff first thing in the morning is so stressful, I just unconsciously try to sleep through it all. Even if I go to bed early/take my beds early, etc I will sleep in that many extra hours to avoid all of that. I feel a lot of guilt about this because the two beings I loved most in this world feel like my source of stress in the morning. My partner is SO kind and supportive - they were the one who pushed me to get an ADHD diagnosis and get help for what ended up being depression - but I know the weight of supporting me as a partner is a lot because of how dysregulated I am. I also suspect they also have undiagnosed ADHD, though more “high-functioning”, so I’m sure the stress of managing the both of us is so much. I want to take more of the load off of them but i feel like I’m stuck in this weird paradox.

I woke up at 9am this morning refreshed for the first time in a LONG time, and I tried really hard to make the morning low-stress as I’m trying to get ready for school but my partner and I ended up in a bit of an argument over I mistake I made dealing with bills. It’s not really an argument I guess, because I felt so guilty and they were really upset because they asked me to help them deal with it. But it screwed up my entire morning trying to deal with it. I didn’t have time to study for a quiz like I planned, I didn’t have time to pack a lunch and I don’t have money to buy a lunch, I forgot to take my meds and the cherry on top is that I forgot about my very fancy coffee I made. It threw me off the whole day because I felt so terrible.

I feel like I’m always battling myself and I feel so awful about not being able to take care of myself or my partner. I don’t even know how to bring something like that argument up because I feel like I’m just trying to offload ANY mental stress onto my partner or make them deal with their struggles alone.

On November 13, 2018, residents of Enschede, Netherlands, called the police to report a woman in extreme distress. But what was really concerning was what she was saying. The woman was running down the streets and screaming, ""My husband's been murdered, my husband's been murdered!"" When the first officers arrived, they managed to speak to the woman, and she told them that she found two bodies in a commercial building at the intersection of Van Leeuwenhoekstraat and Snelliusstraat. The building she directed them to was one the police knew well.

The building was a commercial structure with both businesses and residences, and the current landlords have lived there since 2017. One of the businesses was a garden supply store, and the other was a restaurant. The building was located in a neighbourhood with a decades-long reputation for disadvantage.

The police had long suspected the businesses it contained of being fronts, while one store was registered with the Chamber of Commerce as a wholesaler of garden supplies, and while that was what any customers who walked in would see, the mayor of Enschede suspected otherwise and, on many occasions, tried to have the business closed. But his efforts were unsuccessful because they posed no threat to public safety, so he had no cause to close them down. 

The mayor was not alone in his suspicions; various neighbours also felt that something wasn't right and often reported that large, expensive cars, valued at around 40-50,000, drove back and forth from the building in the dead of night. One time in 2017, a Mercedes was even found on fire not far from the building. 

On June 20, 2018, during an inspection of the building, 17 kilograms of dried cannabis buds were seized by the police, and they placed two men under arrest on drug charges. They were 43-year-old Tuan Nguyen and 34-year-old Artur Sargsyan. Nguyen had a prior arrest on his record from several years prior for operating a cannabis farm in Potsweg.

Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant, owned the growshop, having purchased it from Artur in April 2018. He had been operating it ever since. He moved to the Netherlands with his wife and daughter.

[Tuan Nguyen](https://preview.redd.it/ydsdb5mqcleg1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc6a9828f553d2998aa6d088b3983b3a15314382)

Meanwhile, Artur, an Armenian immigrant, helped Nguyen run the store even though he was no longer the owner. Artur had a residence 15 kilometres away in Hengelo, but he chose to live in an apartment above one of the building's restaurants. Artur had a child and was expecting another in four months.

[Artur Sargsyan](https://preview.redd.it/wgummstucleg1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d811cc73a42315da526dd8f959c8043c799680c)

Both Artur and Nguyen were released pending trial. Eventually, the police cleared Artur of suspicion, but the charges were only dropped on December 7, after the incident had already occurred. In October, the police conducted a surprise inspection of the building but found no grounds to arrest Nguyen for a second time. 

The responding officers entered the grow shop through the back door. As soon as the police opened the door, they saw Artur's body lying on the floor before the officers even stepped inside. Artur was lying on his back with a large pool of blood at his head. After the police stepped inside, they looked to their left and found a second body. This body, belonging to a Middle Eastern man, was also on the floor, lying on his stomach in another puddle of blood.

The police left the building and called for back-up, which arrived in droves. Several police cars, officers and forensic personnel arrived at the building. Several reporters also showed up, and a police helicopter was circling above Enschede.

The police and forensic personnel confirmed that both Artur and the other victim had been executed by a single gunshot each, and their working theory was that it was likely a drug-related murder. The police assumed it was just a double murder, but tragically, a second search of the building would show them that wasn't the case. 

Next to the kitchen was a work/storage area. In this room, the police found the dead body of an elderly European man. The police had entered this room during their first search, but they didn't see the body, as it was hidden behind 4 tall white boxes, all placed next to one another. The man was found lying in a puddle of his own blood, and his right arm was raised under his chin, suggesting he tried to protect himself from the gunshot.

Then a fourth body was found in the grow shop itself. This body was hidden behind a counter and near a large water tank. He was lying on his side in a pool of blood, and the evidence indicated he was likely trying to run away when the killer fired the murder weapon. This body belonged to Nguyen.

[A diagram of the crime scene](https://preview.redd.it/2r6abw2duleg1.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=51c580c397db4a78d3c959ac74526b02ee166efa)

The police quickly identified the other two bodies. The Middle Eastern man was of Syrian descent, 27-year-old Maijkel Akfidan. 

[Maijkel Akfidan](https://preview.redd.it/ic2dzgvbdleg1.png?width=194&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f67aa09483b09563e3f6bcde75949fcbf0d717)

Maijkel, who was only a week away from his 28th birthday, was a married father with two daughters at his home in Hengelo. In Hengelo, Maijkel ran a Mexican restaurant with his brother. Maijkel was loved and respected by his local community, so much so that at his funeral, all of the mourners were unable to fit inside the church.

Maijkel was in the shop that day because he was a friend of Artur's, since Artur's apartment was above one of his Mexican restaurants and Artur was a regular customer. Maijkel had no prior criminal history, no interactions with the police, and he didn't know Nguyen. The police concluded that Maijkel had no involvement in any of Nguyen's suspected criminal activities and had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The wrong place at the wrong time was also the situation the final victim found himself in. The white man found hidden behind the boxes was a local Dutchman, 62-year-old Max Klaassen. 

[Max Klaassen.](https://preview.redd.it/slmlyra7dleg1.png?width=191&format=png&auto=webp&s=2872f24a00889b009825c311d9470e02db4faee4)

Max, together with his business partner, ran a company in Huissen that sold plant nutrition and artificial fertilizers to clients working in the agricultural and horticultural industry. Max went to Enschede to deliver a shipment to Nguyen's Garden Supply Shop. Max was simply there as part of his job and was unaware that Nguyen's store was likely a front. Like Maijkel, he had no prior criminal history, and the police concluded that he was both uninvolved and unaware of Nguyen's activities.

All four of the murders were very cold-blooded. All of them had been shot in the head and at very close range, with the closest shot being fired from an estimated 10 centimetres.

The quadruple homicide came as a shock to Enschede, with the city's mayor stating at a press conference that the murderers were a ""low point"" for the city. And on top of that, it was the biggest loss of life the city had experienced in a single incident since 2000, when a fireworks depot exploded, killing 23 people, including four firefighters. It was the largest explosion the Netherlands had seen since World War 2. It was also the first quadruple homicide the Netherlands had seen since 1998, with the case being referred to as ""Kwartetmoord.""

In response to the murders, a team of approximately 80 detectives was assembled and assigned specifically to this case, with them all working around the clock so the investigation would be constantly ongoing 24/7. This made it the largest police investigation the Twente region had seen since the aforementioned fireworks disaster from 2000.

The same evening the bodies were found, the police made their first arrests. Two men in Dordrecht were arrested for the murders, but they were released only a few days later after the police ruled them out. The only reason the police suspected these two was that they had visited the grow shop and left shortly before the murders, and were seen having a conversation with Nguyen.

The police placed the time of death at around 2:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. They reached this conclusion around then, when the neighbours reported hearing several loud bangs, which they at the time believed were fireworks, followed by a car driving away. 

The police went door to door, questioning locals about whether they had seen anything suspicious during those hours. The police also canvassed for CCTV and Dashcam footage in the area at the same time.

Through these efforts, the police came across three witnesses. They told the police that after the estimated time of death, two men parked a car outside the building and went inside the shop. If the witnesses were correct about when this happened, Nguyen and Maijkel's bodies would've been the first thing the two saw. But instead, the witnesses said they calmly left the store smiling and looking satisfied with themselves. The two then got back in their car and drove away. Other witnesses also reported seeing an older man with a fedora and two younger men who appeared to be twin brothers.

Aside from these witnesses, all the forensic evidence the police found inside the building pointed to multiple killers. 10 bullets had been fired, and after comparing the casings of all 10, they were all fired from different weapons. The police also found three different pairs of footprints in the victim's blood.

And lastly, there was DNA galore. The police found DNA on a cartridge casing and a disconnected cable from a security camera. The police also caught the three killers on CCTV and were able to identify all three of them as 57-year-old Camil A. 

[Camil A](https://preview.redd.it/0ipv42vrtleg1.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf25d649e262dff2aa3564ff76b4a6d20af2880a)

And his sons, 32-year-old Dejan A. and 30-year-old Denis A., Denis's DNA was also in the system from a prior conviction. 

Camil was born in Yugoslavia and during the Yugoslav wars, served as a captain in the Serbian military and, allegedly, the Serb Volunteer Guard. In 1992, he immigrated to Germany, supposedly so he could avoid taking part in many of the war crimes and massacres that were taking place in the region at the time. In 1993, he left Germany to settle in the Netherlands, where he married and had four children. 

His son, Dejan, also had a military background, having once left the Netherlands to serve in the French Foreign Legion. Dejan's DNA was in the system from a domestic violence incident against his girlfriend back in 2010. Outside of crime and the military, Dejan worked a series of odd jobs and occasionally played professional soccer.

Denis seemed to have the cleanest history of the three. He attended a vocational college but never finished, and he made a living delivering newspapers. Denis had dreams of being a rapper and was regularly seen at nightclubs in the area. 

While Camil supposedly wanted to avoid being a war criminal, just being a criminal in general was perfectly fine by him. The family was involved in the cannabis trade and at both of their houses, grew a total of 2,000 plants. One of the homes they rented from the housing association was converted into a farm, costing 25,000 Euros in damages. They even demolished some of the walls to make room for more plants.

The three were also known to be violent with anyone who opposed them and would not handle a dispute diplomatically. In 2017, Camil and Dejan were arrested and appeared before a court in Almelo on charges of burglary and cannabis trafficking. Camil was found not guilty, but Dejan was convicted, though his sentence was only 200 hours of community service. Community service that he regularly failed to attend.

Afterward, the housing association evicted them from their homes, and they had to live in an apartment in Hengelo. In addition, the family was in severe debt due to the loss of their illegal trade, legal fees and the debt they were now in to the housing association for converting one of their homes into a weed farm. So the three needed a plan to get more money. And that was exactly what they did. 

On November 7, only a week before the murders, two armed men entered a car dealership in Hengelo. The four employees were held at gunpoint and locked in the office. They were held hostage for hours while the two men discharged their firearms and threatened to cut off one of their fingers to scare them into compliance. The two made off with 450 Euros.

The shell casings left behind at the dealership matched those found at the grow shop. In addition, the two gunmen were caught on the dealership's CCTV, but by the time they were able to view the footage, the murders had already happened. Either way, the footage showed that Camil and Dejan were the culprits in this incident. 

CCTV footage from their apartment building in Hengelo showed the two leaving around midday, visiting a furniture store, and then making their way to the growshop. Half an hour after the murders, the CCTV cameras recorded them returning to their apartment wearing different clothes and carrying bags to and from their vehicle, a vehicle the cameras also showed Dejan cleaning. 

In addition, the police tracked their activities after they finished the murders and saw them casually driving to the housing association to pay off their debt and also drove to Brabant to ""enjoy life"" and have a fun night in the city. 

[Camil and Dejan leaving the housing association's office after paying off their debt.](https://preview.redd.it/ypsv0ttusleg1.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4be50b6cfc91104f51ac73da40a111710287cf5)

Instead of arresting them immideately, the police placed the family under surveillance. Over 40 plain-clothed police officers were involved in surveilling the family, and once their surveillance showed that they were planning ""retaliatory attacks,"" they knew it was time to make their move.   

On November 26, Camil and Dejan were pulled over and arrested near the village of Enter. At the time of their arrest, they were driving on the A1 highway toward Enschede. Denis was arrested at their apartment on November 27. When the police arrested Denis, they found a firearm on his person, although testing showed that it was not one of the murder weapons. According to Denis, the gun was quite old, and he planned to sell it to a museum. 

After their arrests, the police seized their vehicle and found bloodstains inside that Dejan had missed during his cleaning. DNA from the blood was identified as belonging to Nguyen. The police also took the family's footwear to compare with the shoe prints found in some of the victim's blood, which were also a match. A search of Denis's car also turned up trace amounts of gunpowder and a bullet casing. With that, the police caught their murderers, but they still wanted to know one thing: where did the guns come from?

The only statements the three made were to deny any involvement in the murders before exercising their right to remain silent so they wouldn't get that answer from them.

On January 22, 2019, the police arrested two men from the village of Sint Willebrord, 71-year-old Arie van D. and his 32-year-old son, Dennis van D. The two were already serving a 24-month and a 15-month sentence, respectively, for supplying illegal firearms to a lawyer, and now they were suspected of providing Camil, Dejan and Denis with them as well. 

Leading up to the murders, Dejan was looking for an AK-47 and contacted someone to hook him up with someone who could provide them with some illegal firearms. The person he spoke to was his girlfriend, Zizi W., who then connected them with Arie and Dennis. She ended up divulging this information to two undercover police officers. 

One of the first defences raised was the possibility that the murders were actually revenge carried out by Mexican drug cartels. A Mexican national named Cristian Morena Sanchez and his twin sister's 4-year-old daughter were both murdered in March 2018. Their dismembered body parts were then found along the Twente Canal near Hengelo. 

At the time of his murder, Cristian was in possession of 100 kilos of cocaine and 100 kilos of heroin, which went missing after his murder. Nguyen soon bought the stolen heroin, which was the true motive of his murder. The culprit would've been Cristian's sister, who was out for revenge, and one of Nguyen's friends betrayed him by saying he, along with ""some Vietnamese"", murdered her brother and daughter. 

The prosecution dismissed this theory outright. Its origin came from a journalist who posted about it on his website. Not only did the prosecution dismiss any possibility of Cristian's murder being connected to the quadruple homicide in Enschede, but they also said that Cristian just didn't exist, there were no records of it happening, and there was no mention of the case predating May 2019, when it was first brought up.

Their trial began in full on September 15, 2020, before the Almelo Court. Camil, Dejan and Denis once again exercised their right to remain silent throughout the proceedings. The prosecution admitted that though they couldn't determine exactly who had fired which shot and therefore who killed whom, but stated that they were all equally responsible.

[A courtroom sketch of the three during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/0izcwl23uleg1.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf276fb63ba7747c76372617abfab5b919194a88)

The prosecution added that there was no evidence that any of the three knew the victims prior to the murders as an aggravating factor. As for why they might've targeted Nguyen and his business specifically? Nguyen regularly kept thousands of Euros at home so he could always pay for any deliveries exclusively in cash, and Camil was likely aware of this; since he had several deliveries scheduled for that day, he likely had thousands of Euros on hand.  

While the defendants themselves said nothing, their lawyers argued that there was no evidence against them. Dejan's lawyer said that their DNA at the scene doesn't prove they were the killers, and he proposed another suspect. Nguyen had a public argument with a coffee shop owner in Enschede, during which the cafe owner threatened Nguyen. He argued that this was the real cause of the murders and criticized the police for not investigating him thoroughly enough. 

Camil's lawyer went a step further and not only said his client wasn't guilty, but denied that it was even a murder case, instead referring to it as a ""highly escalated incident"". He also denied that the three had any weapons and said that if they were to be convicted of anything, it should be manslaughter instead of murder. 

When Camil broke his silence for the first time, it was too accuse the police of corruption and argued that they planted his son's DNA on the shell casings. The judge seemed quite furious at the idea of corruption happening in his court and told Camil, ""If you're talking about possible corruption, then I also want names and numbers."" Instead of providing them, Camil refused to speak any further on the subject. 

The most noteworthy example of Camil exercising that right at every opportunity came from this interaction with the judge. For context, he had previously declared he and his son were innocent and that he would testify to that fact, to which the judge said, ""Why don't you do it then?"" Camil replied with ""I'll do it when the time is right."" The judge asked what the right time would be, to which Camil said, ""That's up to you."" Without missing a beat, the judge responded, ""Well, then I say, now is the time,"" followed by Camil saying, ""Right to remain silent, right to remain silent,"" before saying no further. 

On November 6, 2020, the court returned its verdict and found Camil, Dejan and Denis guilty of the triple murders of Tuan Nguyen, Artur Sargsyan, Maijkel Akfidan, and Max Klaassen. On top of being ordered to pay 877,000 Euros in damages to the relatives, the four were given a life sentence. Unlike most countries in Western Europe, the Netherlands actually has a real, full-life-without-parole sentence on the books, commutable only by a royal pardon, and this was the sentence the father-and-son trio were slapped with.  

At the same time, Zizi, Arie and Dennis were also on trial for their roles in the murders. Dennis and Arie also invoked their right to remain silent, but Dennis broke his silence to declare his fascination with weapons to the court before immideately invoking his right once again. 

When interviewed by the police, Arie told them, ""What my son did is terrible. I hope it will come to light,"" followed by saying he was afraid his son would see him as a ""traitor"". When this statement was brought up during the trial, Dennis said that his elderly father had dementia and was incapable of making any statements. In court, Arie also stated that he couldn't understand his statements when they were read out by the prosecution. In addition, he also suffered from partial deafness, having long had problems with hearing clearly.

Dennis van D. was found guilty of arms trafficking and given a sentence of 11 months imprisonment; his father was acquitted due to a lack of any concrete evidence that he took part in selling the weapons to Camil, Dejan and Denis. Meanwhile, Zizi was given a 14-month sentence. Zizi was given the higher sentence as she showed no remorse over what the guns she helped them obtain were used for, and continued to support Dejan.

The prosecution tried charging them with being accomplices to the murders, but all three were acquitted on that charge, as no evidence could be produced proving they knew the murders were going to happen.

Immediately, the three announced their intention to appeal their sentences. While Denis remained silent, Camil and Dejan said they were ready to speak, and Camil had his story ready. And it began with a confession that he did know the victims after all.

Three days before the murders, Camil said he met Artur at a market in Hengelo. The two had known each other for years, and according to him, Artur was in trouble. He had supplied known criminals with a bunch of weapons, but the guns were defective, and he was given only a few days' warning to fix the situation. 

As Camil was an ex-soldier who fought in the wars that led to Yugoslavia's dissolution, Artur figured he could help him out. He gave him the defective weapons and asked him to take them home and fix them, as he'd have experience in such matters. He took the firearms back home, examined and repaired them, and met up with Artur two days later. 

Dejan delivered the weapons and ammunition to the store, and Artur would ask for more ammunition. So that evening, Dejan returned to the shop only to see Nguyen being beaten by several unknown men. Dejan scared the attackers off and dropped Nguyen off at the hospital, which explained why the police found his blood in his car.

The remaining firearms were due to be delivered the next day, but when Camil, Dejan and Denis arrived at the shop, nobody was there. So they went out to eat before deciding to check back in. 

[CCTV footage of the three entering a McDonalds prior to the murders. \(This part of the story was verified\)](https://preview.redd.it/9mrzqxerhleg1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed90fae92e87963d51744c742c5c23cec8faf58)

According to Camil, he saw two men and two women leave the shop and drive away in a black car. 

Dejan and Denis both approached him and told him that ""something terrible"" had happened. When he went to investigate, he saw Nguyen and Maijkel's dead bodies. As the three had a bunch of dubiously sourced firearms in their possession at the time, they didn't report the murders to the police and instead went back home. 

When they got home, Denis went to the gym while Camil and Dejan drove to Brabant. Camil had a date with his mistress scheduled there while Dejan wanted to visit his cousin, who knew someone who could take the weapons off their hands. On the way, they picked up Zizi. 

While Dejan and Zizi were having a meal, Camil encountered three Albanians in the parking lot. The Albanians needed weapons for some unknown purpose, so Camil decided to sell them off to them for 5,000 Euros, which he said was the source of the money they used to suddenly pay off their debts and enjoy themselves in Brabant. 

On August 13, 2022, Camil was found dead in his cell at Veenhuizen prison at the age of 61. According to the autopsy, the cause of death was a heart attack. 

In their father's absence, Dejan and now even Denis made their own statements. 

According to Denis, drove from his hometown of Nijverdal to Hengelo to register a black Volkswagen Golf in his name, something he often did with the temporary cars he drove. Camil asked him to accompany him and his brother to Enschede. On the way, Dejan told him they needed to stop at the grow shop. 

Camil and Dejan went to the shop to speak with Artur. He wasn't in at the moment, but he'd be back later. The three waited for an hour, but Artur still hadn't turned up. But they stayed, enjoying coffee while Max arrived to deliver the fertilizer. Finally, Artur arrived with Maijkel, with Camil and Artur shaking hands before taking a seat in the office. 

Denis left the car and stayed in the office with Max, striking up a conversation with him and Maijkel, while Camil and Dejan spoke with Artur and Nguyen. Then, Denis heard his father screaming, followed by two large bangs. He tried to flee, but then Nguyen ran into the office, wounded and being chased by Camil, shouting in Serbian that he wanted to shoot everyone in the head before doing just that to Nguyen. Dejan then entered the office and did the same to Maijkel and Max. 

Camil then ordered his two sons to look for money, but they only found some in Nguyen's pockets. He then saw Dejan pulling the cable from a security camera, so he did the same to another camera, explaining how some of his DNA had gotten on the cable.  

Lastly, Denis said that he pressured both of his sons and intimidated them into compliance. He accused Camil of intimidating them after the murder and occasionally pointing a gun at them while they were disposing of some evidence, such as the CCTV cameras, on his orders. Additionally, on the drive home, the only words Camil said to both of them were ""Listen, shut up."" Upon getting home, he ordered them to change their clothes and to never speak of murders.

According to Denis, in the 13 days between the murder and his arrest, he only saw his father once when he visited him for his girlfriend's birthday.

Dejan's lawyer said he could not use this statement in evidence, as Denis's relatives said he made it rather than Denis himself having it during a conversation with the police or the court (though Denis never denied making it). Regardless, many were unconvinced, and the prosecution believed Denis was just exploiting his father's death to make a statement exonerating him and shifting all the blame onto his father without Camil being around to dispute it. 

The two made another statement this time in open court, with Dejan denying being one of the shooters. He said that they went to the shop to deliver Artur's weapons when Nguyen called Camil a ""dirty dog,"" which angered him greatly. Something Denis and Dejan said wasn't uncommon, and that their father would lash out at any perceived insult. 

This prompted Camil to shoot Nguyen dead and then kill the other three to eliminate any witnesses. Dejan and Denis denied carrying any guns and said their father dual-wielded two pistols and that he alone fired all of the shots. He added that his father was ambidextrous to explain how he still managed to land all but one of the shots.

When asked why they were suddenly so talkative now when at their last trial they opted to be silent at every oppertunity, Dejan said their last lawyers instructed them to do that, he stated, ""That silence was a game played by my previous lawyers."" and added that he now knew that ""talking gets you further"".

On February 28, 2025, the Court of Appeal in Zwolle reached its decision. They argued that Camil and Dejan's new story, as well as Camil's story prior to his death, were not credible and upheld the brothers' life sentences.

1qilftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qilftm/for_my_12th_birthday_my_dad_surprised_me_with_two/,"For my 12th birthday, my dad surprised me with two real life mermaids.","I (21f) have just escaped my parents, after finding something horrifying in my dad’s beach house. 

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid whether that was TV shows, movies, books.

Any marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss, also known as the deep end of our neighbor’s pool. 

Mom said I didn’t realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool. 

So there I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom’s retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor’s patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn’t go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut... 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. 

I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands…. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*“Okay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don’t you try fake water?”*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids’ games about solving puzzles underwaterand immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids, beautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn’t, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation, the squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he’d always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn’t swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. 

Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But… neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother’s room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don’t think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead... 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn’t get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that “Harvey loves the water!” made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out. Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn’t understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving. Did such a thing exist? I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy before feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I couldn't control.

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, “It wasn't his fault.” 

“But it *was* my dad’s fault,” I told her, leaning forward in my chair. “He killed my brother.”

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag, it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. “Well, maybe you should forgive him.”

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

“It was an accident, Sadie,” Mom said. “Your father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.” She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. “Harvey asked him to take him out during a storm.”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. “But you said—”

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom’s eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. “Do you want to get takeout tonight?”

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad’s fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids’ stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey’s death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. “Grieving is an individual emotion!” Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother’s death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears..

Mom definitely wasn't over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, “How's school?” 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something– someone– normal. 

I found ‘normal’ in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, “Happy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!”

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. Dad’s new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, “Just give it a little more time,” I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad’s place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father’s house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  But running away seemed childish—even for a soon to be twelve year old. I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad’s mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

“Sadie?” Dad’s voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home– stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom’s house. 

Dad’s was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad’s voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. “I'm in the basement, sweetie!”

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself attracted to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises on the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad’s house were yet to be renovated. Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. 

My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. 

Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, “Happy 12th birthday!”

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad’s words, my gaze glued to the glass..

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. “I asked my friends for a favour,” he said. “They specialise in marine research, and…well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.” Dad’s grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. 

I don't know what I was expecting. 

Was it a new species of fish? 

“They're shy.” Dad hummed. “Just stay there, and they'll come over to you.”

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *“They?”*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass—a beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her waist was rugged, carved into her flesh.

Gills. This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn’t* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. “The male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.”

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

“Uh-huh.” I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. “They're yours, Sadie,” Dad murmured into my hair. “I have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.”

“Mermaids.” I said. 

Dad nodded. “Well, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,” he chuckled, “They are mermaids.”

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and  narrow features, told me he belonged in the ocean. 

I had dreamed of being able to breathe underwater, and this boy didn't need air to breathe, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. “We haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.” Dad’s eyes were wide. “It's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.”

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

“What do you think you're going to call them?” Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. “They don't have names?”

He shrugged, and then Dad’s expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here– and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. “They were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.”

I met the girl’s eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy’s hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

“Falan.” I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. “The male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,” he said, “His paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.”

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

“Aira.”

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. “I think she likes her name,” he said, heading to the door. “Elle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.”

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have “the talk” but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me.

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too– or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, “Oh, wow, it's a weird device with a light. I've already seen one.”

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pokémon. I think it was the bright colours, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pokémon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was him who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad’s beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I came to them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide.

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so why was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. 

He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

“You want me to open the tank?” I said, motioning upwards. 

“Sadie.” 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. “I know they're pretty to look at, Sadie, but they're also dangerous.” 

He nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. “These beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.” 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad’s basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira’s eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from my new college campus every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit. 

I headed back to Dad’s beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid’s eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

“Hey.” I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, “Nice try.”

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

“Where's Falan?” I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter– which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle’s, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother’s clothes. 

But he was dead. He died when I was nine years old. I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. 

I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold.

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. Two college ID’s. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were fucking HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. I don't even remember standing up. With the ID tag in my hands, I strode over to the tank, pressing Aira’s identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

“It's okay,” I told her calmly. “Where's Falan?”

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

“Matthew.” I corrected, quickly. “Where is Matthew?”

Before she could respond, my father’s voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira’s head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father’s footsteps following. I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind a large Amazon package. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy’s legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. “It's okay,” he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. “Once your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.”

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. 

Dad carried the boy up a ladder to the surface. I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. 

“It's okay,” he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, “I know it will hurt, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.” I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy’s throat, slicing it open, and dumping him in the water. 

The boy sank, sharp red exploding around him, tainting the water. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught him, cradling the boy in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The boy jolted suddenly in Aira’s arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flew from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities. 

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and pinned to the wall. 

I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human man cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act.

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan’s body jolted, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

His body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't.

His body was cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso.

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin.

Gills. 

When I felt the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. There's no sign of Mom or Dad. The only thing I have right is Mom’s stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me.

We started talking because we studied together in the library. I always called her my “study partner.”

When the weather was good, we’d go out for lunch, coffee, and just talk. After we finished school, we stayed in touch. It’s been almost 3 years now.

In that time, we’ve done a lot together: go-karting, tree-top trekking, waterfalls, restaurants, trips, etc. We spend real time together, but we never talked about what we actually are.

Just to be clear, this isn’t a money thing. We usually split everything. We both have decent cars. Sometimes I pick her up, sometimes she picks me up. So there’s no “using” going on, which honestly makes this situation even more confusing.

We’re both around 20. It’s starting to bother me mentally because I don’t want to keep doing couple-type activities without clarity.

I also don’t really believe in dating just for fun at this age. I’m not getting married anytime soon (maybe 5+ years), so I don’t see the point of playing games.

We’re seeing each other this week and I want clarity: are we dating or just friends?

If you were me, when and how would you bring it up in person so it’s clear but not awkward? And how would you handle it if the answer is “just friends” vs “dating”?",4,1768962126.0,SomaliRelationships,10,0.83,False

In 2022, I met my WW. It was love at first sight. I jokingly told him “we’re gonna get married someday”. He liked that and thought it was funny. We did long distance, but our relationship escalated fast. After 2 months as his girlfriend, I noticed some inconsistencies. I did a little digging and found out he was married which was not disclosed to me. I confronted him and blocked him. After a couple weeks, we got back in contact and he told me that they were already separated when we had met, she cheated on him, they had all these problems and the marriage was over, etc etc. He told me that if I give him the chance, he will prove his love for me. So I did.

He did not miss a beat. He showed me the divorce papers within weeks. He called me every single night on FaceTime NEVER missed a night. Most nights we fell asleep together. Most importantly, he taught me how to feel safe. He spent months reassuring me and making me feel safe enough to conquer my avoidance and shutting down which was always a problem for me. He started making the 7.5 hour drive to me on weekends and our chemistry flourished. It was the happiest time of my life. I was graduating college and he told me to come live with him, so I did. I had never lived well with a partner, but with him? It was perfect. I still struggled with avoidance and shutting down occasionally, and when he told me it made the relationship feel strained for him, I sought therapy immediately. I told my therapist “I want to be better so my relationship can flourish. So our children can be in this safe and and happy home”.

In the middle of 2023, I was blindsided. I got a message from a woman on Facebook telling me she was also his girlfriend. They had been talking for 3 months and dating for 2 weeks. I don’t know how she found me. It was CRUSHING. We broke up, but I was stuck there in his house with nowhere to go. I didn’t know what to do…. So I contacted his ex wife. We had coffee and She explained that he had been a serial cheater their entire 7 years. She said after meeting me he blindsided her with divorce papers. It was terrible.

After confronting him (this all happened over the time span of about a month) he admitted that this was a problem he had. He suggested he try therapy too, and that he believed it was something he could change for our relationship. I believed him and went back.

Since then it has been a ROLLERCOASTER. I have come to learn so much about him and I think he’s beyond saving. There have been so many instances I find out something new or there is a new woman that comes up. Despite that… the nature of our relationship didn’t change as much as you would expect it to. We laugh all the time, we go camping,  and dream of a family. We picked out an engagement ring. He supported me while I worked for my dream job. He bought me a brand new car when I totaled mine and felt lost. He made me a part of his family and included me with his friends. But he wouldn’t stop seeking out other women. We tried therapy, sex addicts anonymous meetings, podcasts, books, everything. He either lies about the time he spends doing these things or it doesn’t work for him.

The breaking point came on Christmas Eve. The night before, I asked if we could spend time together doing Christmas stuff. He told me that he couldn’t because he had plans with his friend “B”. I thought this was weird because he hung out with “B” the night before and they don’t usually see each other often. When they had hung out the night before, WP told me where they were going, what they were doing, and even invited me. But this night was different. I got no info. Just “going out with B”. I knew what this meant. I knew this pattern. I cried myself to sleep.

The next morning was Christmas Eve. WP told me he couldn’t wait to spend the day with me and all the Christmas things we could do. I told him “no”. I told him “I don’t want to cry on anymore holidays. I don’t want to be treated this way anymore”. And I left. I still think of his face, sitting by our tree with all of our gifts wrapped. I left.

Within 2 weeks he had a new girlfriend. This made me reach out. Why wasn’t I enough? Was all of this a game to you? He told me to go away, he doesn’t want to deal with this anymore. He would make my car payment for me and that would be it.  I went to the house on Sunday to get my things and he was there. He looked flustered when he saw me, and told me he had to go to work. In the 3 + years we were together, he never worked a Sunday. I asked if we could talk, I thought I at least deserve a conversation, But he left and I packed my things, said goodbye to our shared cat, and we haven’t spoken since. I feel like I’m being eaten alive.

When I left, I figured he would do what he does: date and sleep with anyone he pleases. But I figured it would get boring for him, he would feel the regret of the cheating, and seek actual help. But now that he is going into the cycle again, I am realizing that might be far fetched and walking away this time is actually the end.",1,1768962124.0,survivinginfidelity,4,0.67,False

Just got my (first) blood tests back and I'm a bit surprised by some of the results given my lifestyle. Looking for input on what might be going on and whether I should adjust my approach.

**About me:**

* 30s male, pretty lean (visible abs, people generally think I look fit), not sure about exact BF%
* Lift 4x/week (Stronger by Science Hypertrophy program, recently doing supersets + 20 min bike after)
* Hot vinyasa yoga 2-3x/week (fairly intense)
* Occasional Norwegian 4x4 on the rower for VO2 max
* Diet is very consistent, mostly home-cooked: yogurt + eggs for breakfast, big salad for lunch with chicken, roasted chicken or other meat with vegetables and sweet potatoes for dinner, salmon 1-2x / week.
* Don't drink much (1-2 drinks / week max, usually). More recently not drinking at all. Sometimes this goes up during travel.
* Sleep is generally quite good I think. In bed for 8 hrs / night. Whoop usually logs 7-7.5 hours of sleep.

**Current supplements:**

* Creatine
* Vitamin D (10,000 IU/day)
* Fish oil (Nordic Naturals)
* Magnesium glycinate + glycine at night
* Theanine
* Occasional multivitamin
* Coffee in the morning

**Results that surprised me:**

|Marker|My Result|Target Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Glucose|98 mg/dL|75-86|
|Homocysteine|11.2 umol/L|4-8|
|ApoB|61 mg/dL|≤60|
|LDL-P|1013 nmol/L|≤935|
|Vitamin B12|439 pg/mL|700-930|
|Vitamin D|45 ng/mL|50-80|
|Free Testosterone|76.8 pg/mL|100-200|
|Bioavailable T|157.9 ng/dL|175-250|
|SHBG|47 nmol/L|20-40|
|Cortisol|20.9 mcg/dL|10-18|
|Prolactin|16.4 ng/mL|4-10|
|eGFR|84|≥95|
|Uric Acid|6.2 mg/dL|3.5-5|
|BUN|20 mg/dL|10-16|
|Creatinine|1.17 mg/dL|0.74-1.05|
|Ferritin|132 ng/mL|60-120|

**My main concerns:**

1. **Glucose at 98** – This seems high for someone eating clean with no processed foods or sugar. Could this be a dawn phenomenon thing? Should I get a CGM to investigate?
2. **Homocysteine at 11.2** – This one really surprised me. I eat eggs daily and take fish oil. Is this pointing to a methylation issue? Should I add methylated B vitamins?
3. **ApoB/LDL-P slightly elevated** – Not terrible but higher than I'd expect. Worth addressing or noise?
4. **Low testosterone markers with high SHBG, cortisol, and prolactin** – This pattern concerns me. Could the high cortisol be driving SHBG up and lowering free T? I do train pretty hard. Is this overtraining, or something else?
5. **B12 is low despite eating eggs/meat daily** – Absorption issue?
6. **Kidney markers (eGFR, BUN, creatinine, uric acid)** – I know creatine can affect these. Should I be concerned or is this expected?

**Questions:**

* Is 20-30 min of moderate cardio post-lifting enough, or should I be adding dedicated longer zone 2 sessions for metabolic health?
* Any obvious supplement additions? Thinking methylated B-complex for the homocysteine/B12, maybe bumping vitamin D. But I already take 10k IU.
* Should I be worried about the testosterone/cortisol pattern, or is this just reflecting high training stress?

If you’re 24–38, have a decent mic (or just use your phone), and think it’d be cool to have someone occasionally drop a 30-second–2-minute voice message into your chat when the mood hits, say hi. Tell me the last song you hummed to yourself so I know what vibe you’re on.

No need to be super talkative. No need to reply right away. Just someone who won’t think it’s weird when a voice note from a stranger pops up at 3 a.m. saying “I just saw the moon and it looked fake.”

1qilb3u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qilb3u,Anko Teaches Japanese #4: Katakana,"We have already reviewed Hiragana, so let's get onto the second writing system of Japanese: Katakana.

Lesson #4: Katakana

Katakana is fortunately, incredibly easy to learn once you know hiragana, as it consists of the same rules and amount of characters as hiragana. Just like in hiragana; katakana is divided into several columns and rows, representing the different vocal and consonant combinations each symbol creates.

It does from rows of A-I-U-E-O for vowels, and columns for vowel-K-S-T-N-H-M-Y-R-W. So then the combination of say, I + K would be KI (キ).

Just like in hiragana, you can make extra sounds by adding Dakuon and Handakuon at the top right of the symbols: K into G, S into Z, T indo D, H into B and P.

For example: デ = DE, プ = PU, ツ = TSU

You may have noticed. Just like in hiragana, some of these symbols make different sounds than expected. Instead of シ making ""SI"", it creates a ""SHI"" sound (pronounced she), フ is ""FU"" instead of ""FU"" (Pronounced Foo). Refer to the chart I provided for guidance on these exceptions.

Also just like with hiragana, you can combine symbols to make new sounds, by adding a small kana at the right of the symbol you wish to combine with.

For example: キャ = KI + YA = KYA.

You may also repeat consonants by adding a small ツ (TSU) symbol before the consonant you wish to repeat, just like you would do in hiragana.

Example: アッタ = A + ツ (Repetition of T) + TA = ATTA.

However, there is one new rule to katakana that does not apply to hiragana. And that is the way you elongate a vowel sound. In hiragana, you simply add a symbol of the vocal you wish to repeat, but in katakana, you must add a new symbol after the vowel you wish to repeat called Chōonpu, it takes the form of a horizontal like (ー).

For example: マー = MA + ー (Repetition of the last vowel) = MAA

So then that begs the question, what is katakana actually used for? What makes it different than hiragana and when do I know which to use? The answer is easy.

Hiragana is for Japanese words, whilst Katakana is used for words that are adapted into Japanese from other languages, basically meaning that Katakana is used to write non Japanese words. But then that brings the issue of there not being certain sounds that exist in hiragana or katakana, such as the letter L. That is accounted for, and solved by using the closest sound possible, take the following word:

チョコレート = CHOKOREETO = Chocolate (Pronounced Cho-co-re-to)

Its romanized version (the English transcript) uses a K instead of a C, and R instead of an L because these aren't available to us. A lot of Japanese words come from English like this, so if you know English already, you'll already know some Japanese words:

コーヒ = KOOHI = Coffee (Pronounced: ""Ko-hee"")

アイスクリーム = AISUKURIIMU = Ice Cream (Pronounced Eyes-soo-coo-ree-moo)

ケーキ = KEEKI = Cake (Pronounced Ke-key)

It might be a lot to take in one single lesson, so just be aware that katakana basically works the same way as hiragana, with different symbols and an added rule.",14,1768961936.0,nokotan,1,1.0,False

Title: I Woke Up and the Weekend Was Erased. That's Not the Worst Part.

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.
I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.
The calendar widget said Thursday.
I remember thinking,
“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”
I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:
“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”
He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.
“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”
He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing.
Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.
They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).
“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.
“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.
Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?
I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”
She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”
The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.
“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”
She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.
The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.
The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.
I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.
I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone. Please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

Log 2:
Title: UPDATE: The guy who DM'd me says the week used to be 14 days long.

I finally got a DM from a guy who knows what I'm talking about.

After my last post, while I was spiraling, a user named Adam reached out. He told me he understands exactly what my situation is. He knows that you know—and I know—that there used to be a Friday, a Saturday, and a Sunday.

But the issue is what he said next. I don't know how to process it.

He said originally, a week was not seven days like I remember. He said a week was 14 days.
He listed them out, but my brain can barely hold onto the names. They sounded ancient, but followed the same pattern we are used to.

He said: Meriday, Falday, Lorday... I think I’m messing up the order. But there were 7 more on top of what I remember.

If I say ""Friday, Saturday, Sunday"" to my coworkers, they look at me like I’m insane. Now Adam is saying something that sounds just as crazy to me. My instinct is to tell him, ""Hey man, don't make things up.""

But he might be right.

I mean, look at me. I’m the only one who remembers the 7-day week. Maybe I just don't remember the original 14 days. Maybe I’m just as amnesiac as the people who forgot the weekend. I feel like I have to believe him. Otherwise, how could he be the only one who validates the existence of the weekend?

I saw some of you in the comments mentioning ""Lorday."" Adam confirmed that was one of the original 14 days. So that kind of validates his story. But here is the scary part: to me, right now, it is Wednesday. But Adam said for him, it was Meriday.

The timeline is no longer a single line for everyone. Things are deeply messed up.

Adam told me something else. Just like I realized everyone around me has lost the concept of church, God, and prayer, Adam remembers a concept called Ecarg (I think that’s the term he used).
He said Ecarg was basically the privilege not to work.

He said he used to have that for the 14-day repeating cycle. He didn't have to work. It was paradise. But then suddenly, he lost it. He said it was because of a tree.

I don't know what that means, but he said after the tree incident, he lost the Ecarg. He lost the 14 days of rest. The week shattered into seven days. He was forced to labor for five, and only rest for two. I had questions but he went offline.

And now... now it’s happening again.

The privilege not to work is being deleted entirely.

Adam went from 14 days of rest to 2.
I went from 2 days of rest to 0.

""No privilege not to work is given anymore.""

I don't know how to interpret this, but yesterday I was worried about Friday not coming. Now I'm worried about losing Wednesday and Thursday.

What if the five-minute break I take is going to go away? What if we only have Monday? What if I have to work 24/7 non-stop? What if even Monday is gone?

I'm terrified…

Today is Thursday... please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

Log 3:
[UPDATE] 12:00. I couldn't do it.

Guys, it’s almost midnight. I was watching the clock, waiting for the miracle.

Adam messaged me one last time. He sounded desperate, like he was seeing something I couldn't. He told me the whole story again. It was again about the tree, and how he messed up with the tree. How he got scammed by a voice like oil.

So what the heck did happen with the tree?

He said he didn't know it was that much expensive, and how that one ""bite"" put him in this debt.

Debt of what?
Debt of labor, he said.

But then why me too?

Adam said he didn't know but instead,
He told me about the guy who took the shift.

The one who worked through the hell of it to clear our balance. Adam said it was all over, that the bill was zero.
He asked me, ""Can you believe this?""

I looked at my phone. I looked at the empty streets and the grey sky. I thought about all the Monday-to-Thursday distress, the endless grind, the exhaustion. What Adam told me was a crazy story. I tried to be logical .. It did not make any sense.

I typed back: ""No….""

Too good to be true is usually a scam.

That was it.

Then, the clock jumped.

Monday. No Miracle.

In the morning, my work alarm will start blaring through the speakers.

My phone is buzzing now. A text from my boss: “Tomorrow, we have a lot to catch up on. Don’t be late.”

The heavy, greasy weight of the debt slammed back onto my chest, twice as heavy as before. I looked out the window, thick and grey fog, hiding everything.

I’m sitting here in the dark, gripping the steering wheel. I don't know what I am missing here.
I have to go. Monday's starting.

Everything started normally. Got up. Made coffee. Took a shower. Same monotonous routine. At eight o’clock, I droned into the kitchen, hair damp and robe loose. I needed to make my husband's lunch for work. 

Coffee in his thermos. Apples sliced with lemon juice. Then, the sandwich. Ham and cheese, his favorite. 

I laid the bread out, slapped the cheddar across it. I reached for the package of ham. 

I opened it, and the sweet smell welcomed me. My hand moved on its own. Two fingers stroking the deli. 

I wasn’t in my kitchen anymore. 

I was thirteen years old, a remote shook in my hand. My kid sister is beside me, hands over her mouth. 

Ocean sounds lilted around the basement of our childhood home, coming from the staticky TV. 

It was the only light in the space, demanding all our attention like moths to flame. 

On the screen, our father stood beside a massage table. 

His strong, hairy hands were drenched in body oil as they rubbed our Christmas ham. 

The sugar glaze mixed with oil and leaked across the massage table. He looked into the camera and licked it off his fingers. 

I couldn’t stand to watch, but I couldn’t look away. 

Our gaze snapped away when the door to the basement opened, and the shape of our father appeared at the top of the stairs. 

“TURN IT OFF!” 

I blinked, and I was back in my kitchen, rubbing a slice of ham between my hands, weeping into it. 

I pulled myself together, laid it reverently on top of the cheese, and closed my husband's sandwich. ",1,1768961524.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I was mainly seeking something for insomnia but I was also going through a difficult period so my mood presented as depressive during my visit. I experience depressive episodes but personally mine can be sufficiently managed by lifestyle improvements, healthy diet and exercise, and better management of my high stress career. I need to follow through on those things but which I have historically failed to do but I have many more good days then bad and all that when it comes to depression. 

I mainly need something to help with sleep. I have always slept poorly and recently got to a period where I was getting 3-4 hours a night of intermittent sleep over the course of a month or so and when I don’t get halfway decent sleep it has a huge negative impact on other areas of my life. I am a currently clean addict for reference and while I prefer to have no pysch meds in my system I needed better sleep.

I started taking 15 mg of Mirtazapane before bed on January 7th and it helped me with sleep dramatically. I struggled greatly with grogginess in the mornings but once I was up moving and had coffee this would pass. On Sunday January 18th I was rushing out of home and put on a pair of boots I’ve had for years and noticed they felt much tighter than usual. I was in a hurry and assumed the socks I wore were too think and went about my day. 4-5 hours later mid movie I had to take my boots off as I was experiencing pain in my feet. Sometimes on airplanes my feet swell and the shoes I was wearing before the flight would feel too tight during the flight this was a similar experience. I could barely put my boots back on after the movie. Got home, examined my feet, my wife and I both agreed they looked swollen. Due to a combination of this swelling and brain fog associated with the grogginess I decided too stop taking the medication as I had a pysch visit for the next day. My first night off the drug I slept the same as if I was taking it it but the next  2/3 nights without the drug my insomnia slowly started returning. On the 19th, 1.5 days after taking the drug for the last time I went to the gym with the intention of doing cardio. I felt extreme soreness in my calves and had trouble even walking now I am on my third or fourth full day without taking the medication and on my walk to work this morning, which is approximately a mile the entire time my calves felt as if I had done extreme exercise the prior day and were incredibly sore and there remained significant pressure in my calves more than my feet, but my feet remain swollen. My psych believes that I am prone to side effects of most drugs and have had issues with a variety of antidepressant type medication in the past such as Zoloft my question for this group is Ken there be anything done to eliminate the swelling and water retention of this medication because while it has worked for my insomnia, and my mood has felt fine the entire time taking it the water retention in my and swelling in my calves and feet is a symptom that is not sustainable for me personally, has anyone experienced something similar and have they found a solution to continue taking the drug while also eliminating this particular symptom I have avoided eating and heavily salted foods although I have increased my sugar intake dramatically during the period of time I’ve been on the medication. If there is no solution to fix the swelling and calves and feet while continuing to take the drug, how long after stopping the medication can I expect the swelling and water retention in my calves and feet to go away?

My brother in law has a 15 mg script for PTSD / Insomnia and he uses it on an ad needed basis whenever he doesn’t sleep well for 2 to 3 nights in a row is that a viable used case for this medication? 

TLDR: in short, I was prescribed and had been taking 15 mg of this medication nightly largely for insomnia and it has been effective for insomnia despite leaving me groggy in the morning and that is a side effect I can live with, but it is caused painful, swelling, and fluid retention in my calves and feet, which is an unsustainable side effectfor me personally is there a way to eliminate the swelling in my calves and feet while continuing to take the medication? if not, how long after stopping the medication should I expect my calves and feet to return to normal?

So I'm sitting in my dorm at like 11 PM, eating my third pack of ramen this week, looking at my bank account. $47. Rent's due in 6 days.

I had a campus library job that paid $12/hour but only gave me 8 hours a week. The math wasn't mathing. I needed money but didn't have time for another ""real"" job between classes and assignments.

My roommate kept telling me about online surveys. I ignored her because it sounded like MLM BS. Then she literally showed me her PayPal - $87 cashout from one week. That's when I actually paid attention.

# What I Actually Did

After trying a few sketchy sites, I landed on SurveyJunkie. It's US-only which sucks if you're international, but as an American student it worked perfectly.

**Here's my exact process:**

1. **Signed up** \- took 2 minutes
2. **Filled out my profile COMPLETELY** \- this is important, don't skip. Took like 10 minutes but it affects what surveys you get
3. **Did surveys during dead time** \- between classes, before bed, during boring Zoom lectures (don't tell my professors lol)
4. **Cashed out through PayPal** once I hit $25

**The math:** 100 points = $1. Most surveys are 50-200 points and take 10-20 minutes. A 100-point survey that takes 10 minutes = $6/hour. Not amazing but you're literally doing it from bed.

# What Actually Worked

**Morning sessions hit different.** I noticed better surveys drop around 8-10 AM on weekdays. Started doing 3-5 surveys with my coffee and that alone got me $10-15.

**Track your points.** I kept a note on my phone. Seeing progress kept me motivated even when I only made $8 that day.

**Use dead time only.** Waiting for class? Survey. Can't sleep? Survey. Commercial break? Survey. Never felt like ""work"" this way.

**Be consistent with your answers.** These platforms track you. If you say you don't have a car then claim you drive a BMW, you'll get flagged. Just be honest.

**Student demographics = better pay.** Surveys targeting college students or young adults paid better and I qualified more often.

# The Real Talk

You won't get rich. You won't replace a job. But I made $400-600 per semester doing this in spare time. That's textbooks. That's groceries. That's not calling my parents asking for money again.

Some days I made $30. Some days $8. Some days I got disqualified from everything and made $0. It's inconsistent but it's flexible.

# The Downsides Nobody Tells You

* You WILL get disqualified from surveys after answering screening questions. It's annoying but normal
* Some days have zero good surveys available
* You need to hit $5 minimum to cash out (I always waited til $25)
* Takes time to build up - first $25 took me like a week, now I can do it in 2-3 days
* Only works if you're in the US and 18+

# Should You Try It?

If you're a US student who:

* Has pockets of free time throughout the day
* Needs extra cash but can't commit to a rigid work schedule
* Already wastes time on your phone anyway
* Is okay with $20-30/week not $2000/week

Then yeah, try it for a week and see.

I've been using it for 3 months now. It's not life-changing but it's gas money, pizza money, emergency fund money. Better than stressing over every coffee purchase.",2,1768961354.0,SideHustleGold,1,0.75,False

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qil0gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qil0gq/whats_your_go_to_roaster_for_whole_bean/,What’s your go to roaster for whole bean?,"I’ve been through a couple of roasters.   Pre covid, myself and a ton of other people loved Vermont Coffee company.   Post covid they really have gone down in quality.   I tried a couple of different roasters and I used to really like vivid in Burlington but the price and shipping (and time waiting) was not desirable.

You can use the wicking effect of paper to separate out the liquid components of ink into separate colors.

Put a line of ink across the paper, then suspend it in water so the paper end gets wet but not deep enough to get the ink in the water. The water will gradually wick up the paper and separate into colors.

This is Lamy Black ink, it's deep black, but you can see it separates out to blue, black, and at the top it is starting to separate out yellow!

This was a HUGE step for me. I’ve been in a situationship for 6 years (I know, I know). I haven’t been on a date in over 4 years because everyone on hinge seems both uninteresting and unattractive to me. I decided to take a big step and follow through with a date. Friends, mom, therapist so proud of me lol. 

Coffee date set for 11am. I texted him beforehand to meet me outside of the coffee shop. I purposely get there at 11:02 because I wanted him to be there first. 

He’s waiting outside and I greet him with a hug saying so nice to meet you! We walk in and he tells me he already bought his coffee and then I notice it in his hand. I was like oh okay!! I go to order mine and he’s standing super far away from me so I pay for it. First red flag he asked me on the date and maybe times have changed but I really thought the guy should be paying? And it was just a $5 iced latte. Whatever noted - continue with sitting down. 

We talk for an hour go over the basics education, career, family etc. Casual banter I really thought it was going well, we have things in common.  He initiates leaving and we get up to go. As we’re walking out he opens the door and walks out first. Didn’t like that either - why not hold the door open for me? 

As I’m hugging him goodbye he says let’s get dinner soon! He texts me when he gets home and I respond to a few messages and then get ready to go watch football with some friends which I told him about during the date. I text him back when I get home later that evening to continue the conversation we had going. No texts since then - Saturday night. It’s now Tuesday night. 

I can chalk up the not paying and holding the door open for me as being nervous and/or just not paying attention. Did it bother me yes but would I give him another chance also yes. 

My question is should I text him again since it’s been 4 days? In my mind I think the guy needs to be more into the girl for it to work. Him not answering me for 4 days is telling me he’s not interested. Is double texting looking desperate? Or am I overthinking this whole thing? 

I really was looking forward to another date. And while selfish I think a big part of me feeling unlikable right now is because I haven’t heard from him and would feel more satisfaction (and sort of a winning feeling) if he answered me. ",0,1768961056.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

This is the first chapter of my 80,000 word novel that nobody has read and probably never will read. 

  
**CHAPTER 1**

""K-O! Fatality!"" the man in full camouflage shouted, startling a bird out of Mrs. Harrison’s magnolia tree.

He wasn’t doing yoga. It wasn’t tai chi. It looked like a cross between martial arts, interpretive dance, and professional wrestling sewn together by a drunk seamstress. He dropped into a crouch, one hand sweeping low as if pulling up grass. Then he rose with a sudden elbow strike at an imaginary foe, settling into a wobbly fighting stance.    

“Finish him!” The man’s elbow struck the air before he rolled to the ground and made snow angels in the grass.

Sean Perkins stared through his living room window at the lawn across the street. The man launched another flurry of awkward punches at the air that reminded Sean of someone swatting bees, then capped it with a kick that clipped Mrs. Harrison's garden gnome. The gnome lost its hat.

""Janice!"" Sean called out, never looking away. ""Did you see this?""

""Busy!""  Her voice came from the kitchen, where she was checking orders for her online craft shop.

""There's a guy in camouflage doing karate.""

""If he's in camouflage, how do you know what he's doing?”

Sean squinted at the figure. His wife had a point. ""Just... come look."" 

Janice padded into the room, hair tousled, her oversized T-shirt making her look younger than their mortgage said she was. She looked out the window. Her expression shifted from curiosity to alarm.  ""Who is he?""

""I was hoping you'd know.""

""You should go talk to him.""

Sean nearly choked. ""Why me?""

""You're the man.""

Sean rotated one degree at a time while his eyes remained locked out the window. ""I am a smart man who knows not to approach strangers doing karate.""

“That's Tank,"" a third voice announced.

They both jumped. Their twelve-year-old son, Zach, had silently materialized, with a Capri Sun straw hanging from his mouth

Janice’s gaze flicked between the window and her son. “How do you know?”

“He asked if I was a kid or a little person.”

Sean’s pulse ticked. “You talked to him?”

“Yeah.” Zach pointed across the street. “He lives there.”

Janice frowned. ""What about Mrs. Harrison?""

""She's still there. Tank's her son.""

Sean groaned. Mrs. Harrison had been the model neighbor: hedges trimmed with protractor precision, front porch swept to a mirror shine, never a whisper of a loud party. The idea that she had produced this was like discovering your Prius gave birth to a monster truck.

Janice folded her arms. ""We should introduce ourselves.""

""I don't want to.""

""Sean, you have no friends.""

He blinked. ""You're my friend.""

""I'm your wife.""

""See? Remember our vows. You promised to be my 'best friend forever'.""

Janice rolled her eyes. “C'mon, I'll bake a pie.”

“Good idea.” Sean leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the window. “A sugar coma might slow him down.”

Zach snorted juice up his nose. Janice cracked a reluctant grin. Sean gave Zach a wink and smiled like he just won “Dad of the Year”. He turned back to the window. Tank was now saluting the mailbox,  then dropped into push-ups while shouting cadence to himself.

Zach took another sip of his Capri Sun. “Tank said he can teach me survival moves, like how to eat tree bark.”

Sean spun. “You are not eating bark.”

“He said it's keto.” Zach squeezed the empty Capri Sun pouch until it crackled.

Sean slowly shook his head. “I need more coffee.”

\#

An hour later, Sean and Janice crossed the street with Janice balancing a fresh apple pie. Tank was still at it. He was drenched in sweat, his camouflage shirt clinging to his chest, but his energy hadn't dipped an ounce. If anything, he was faster. He paused mid-high-kick when they approached.

""Hi, we're the Perkins from across the street,"" Janice smiled.

Tank stared at them, while Sean looked for an exit.

""You already met our son, Zach,"" Sean said. ""I'm Sean. This is my wife, Janice.""

Tank's hand dipped into his pocket and pulled out a yellow electronic gadget. He swept it over them. Beep. Sweep. Beep. Even the pie got a scan.

""What is that?"" Sean asked.

""You ain't never seen a Geiger counter before?""

Sean hesitated. He had seen them in movies involving nuclear meltdowns, but he'd never considered one necessary to assess baked goods. ""Sure, but not in the wild,"" he said.

Janice soldiered on. ""We brought you a pie.""

Tank stared at her. ""Any shellfish in this?""

""No, it's apple,"" Janice said.

""I can't have shellfish.""

""Allergies?"" Sean asked.

""No. They dump chemicals in the ocean. Same with vegetables.""

Sean tilted his head. ""So... you don't eat vegetables?”

""Of course not. Genetically engineered by government scientists. They want us all weak so they can control us."" He spat the word ""scientists.""

Janice leaned in. ""So what do you eat?""

""M-R-Es. Meals Ready to Eat. Battle-tested.""

Sean frowned. ""Wait... you won't eat vegetables because they're altered by the government, but you will eat rations made by the government?""

Tank gave a low growl. ""Don't be silly. I get them from Amazon."" His eyes narrowed. ""What about you two? Why aren't you at work? It's Friday. Normal people work Fridays.""

Sean bristled. ""I'm a writer.""

Tank perked up. ""What kind?""

""Tech manuals.""

Tank's interest sharpened. ""Tech manuals? Like for drones? Microchips? Brain implants that the government uses to turn us into zombies?""

Sean sighed. ""No, mostly computer components... like how not to plug them in upside down.""

""Sounds boring.""

Finally, agreement. ""Oh, it is.""

Janice slid in. ""I run an online crafts store.""

Tank's face dropped. ""Crafts.""

Sean, grasping for civility, asked, ""So what do you do?""

Tank straightened. ""I was in the Army. Now I just stay sharp and ready.""

“Ready for…?""

""You never know, that's why it's important to be ready.""

Sean's head throbbed. ""Of course.""

He made a pivot toward home. ""Well, we'll let you get back to your... karate.""

Tank shook his head. ""It's called Tank-Quan-Doh.""

Sean froze. ""Excuse me?""

""Tank-Quan-Doh. Karate's for amateurs. What I do is a combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Tibetan yoga, and Mortal Kombat.""

Sean's vision glitched, the world freezing like a corrupted hard drive. ""The video game?""

Tank nodded. ""Changed my life.""

Janice tried to redirect. ""Oh, I almost forgot, how's your mom doing?""

""She's been sick. The chemtrails got her.""

""Kim Trails? Wasn't she on Sex and the City?"" Sean said, looking pleased with himself.

“No, that's Kim Catr... “Janice started to say before her voice tailed off. She stared at Sean and his silly little grin and shook her head. “Just because you're a dad doesn't mean you should be telling their jokes.”

After a moment of awkward silence, she said, “Well, we better get back. My brother's coming to stay.""

""Two days Janice. Tommy is only staying for two days,"" Sean said, mostly for himself.

""Your brother?"" Tank asked. ""Is he cool?""

""No,"" Sean said.

“Yes, he's cool."" Janice said, glaring. ""He's an inventor.""

""Stupid inventions,"" Sean muttered.

Janice elbowed him, smile fixed. ""He's creative.""

Tank nodded with approval. ""Good. We'll need him when things go down.""

Sean grimaced. Things were already going down.

\#

As they walked back across the street, Sean glanced at his crabgrass, cracked walkway, rusting bicycle. Not pretty, but predictable. That was what he loved about the suburbs. Mow the grass, it grows back. Wait for July, it gets hot. Wait for December, it gets cold. A reliable operating system. No glitches, no surprises. Definitely no paramilitary yoga.

""What an idiot,"" he said once Tank was out of earshot.

Janice raised an eyebrow. ""You're just jealous.""

Sean stopped mid-step. ""What? That's ridiculous.""

""You're threatened by him.""

""No, I'm not."" His voice rose half an octave. ""Threatened by that? A man who scans pies for radiation? Please... “. They walked in silence for a few seconds. “I am not threatened,"" he repeated.

""You're jealous,"" she insisted.

""I just... "" Sean cut himself off, regrouped. ""I just happen to get all of my moves from Street Fighter. It's a way more respectable franchise.""

That cracked her. Janice burst into genuine laughter.

""All of them, huh?"" she asked.

""Every single one,"" he said, making a slow, exaggerated Hadouken motion with his hands. ""Fireball.""

Janice watched his hands cut through the air. “Don’t pull anything,” she said. Inside, she set the pie plate in the sink and checked her phone. An email notification glowed: new order issue, urgent.

Sean flopped on the couch. “We’re doomed.”

Zach entered munching Goldfish crackers from the box. “Tank says we’re prepared.”

\#

That evening, Sean found Janice at the kitchen table, surrounded by small decorative boxes, ribbon spools, and custom name tags written in careful calligraphy.

“What’s all this?”

“Mrs. Donovan’s book club favors. She’s hosting next week and wants personalized gifts for everyone.” Janice tied a small bow with practiced efficiency, already tired in a way sleep never fixed.

“That’s nice of you,” Sean said, still thinking about the strange new neighbor.

“It’s not nice. It’s business. She’s paying me.” Janice attached a name tag to a completed box. “Julie asked if I could make custom table runners too. Word’s getting around.”

“Who’s Julie?”

Janice looked up. “Chen. Julie Chen. Three houses down? We have coffee together.”

“Oh. Right.” Sean grabbed a beer from the fridge. “Hey, when's your brother coming?”

“Oh, you know Tommy.”

Sean took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. He knew all about Tommy Time. Tommy's version of ""I'll be there at six"" could mean anything from 4 PM to next Thursday, depending on what shiny object had distracted him along the way.

Janice set down the ribbon. ""The HOA sent another letter, threatening fines. They say my business violates zoning laws.”

Sean chuckled. “Zoning laws? That’s ridiculous.” Then he shook his head, “Don't worry, I'll handle it.”

“Sean, I was thinking…” Janice started, but he was already drifting toward the garage, muttering about keeping an eye on the street. She looked at the half-finished boxes spread across the table, then went back to work.

\#

Late that night, long after Sean and Zach were asleep and Janice had retreated back to the kitchen table, a loud bang shook the house and the picture frames rattled on the wall. A shuffling sound followed, like someone dragging a filing cabinet up a staircase. Sean ran downstairs and saw Tommy standing in the living room.

His duffel bag bulged like it had been packed during an emergency evacuation, or possibly a police raid. Knowing Tommy, it contained both a camping stove and a George Foreman grill. His hair defied gravity, his clothes looked like they'd been lumped in that bag since 2008, and he had a permanent worry-free grin that reminded Sean that Tommy never paid rent.

""Hey guys! Sorry I'm late,” Tommy said. “I couldn't remember the address.”

Janice appeared from the kitchen and asked, “Why didn't you call?”

“Took my phone apart for a battery project and couldn’t reassemble the screen.” Tommy stepped inside, dropping the bag with a metallic clatter. “Thanks for letting me crash here. I’m between places.”

Sean muttered, ""Aren't you always?""

Tommy either didn't hear or chose to interpret it as encouragement. ""So it's cool if I surf the couch for a few months?""  

Sean's stomach dropped like he'd missed the last step on a dark staircase.  ""What?!""

""Of course, you're family,"" Janice said without hesitation.

""Yay!"" Zach shouted from down the hall woken by the noise and thrilled by the prospect of chaos. Tommy was his favorite relative because he treated twelve-year-olds as peers.

Sean started to protest and remind her that they agreed that he can stay for two days, but Janice gave him a look that said, “*If you want to argue, you can join Tommy on the couch*.” So he just let out a deep breath and went back to bed.",2,1768960805.0,writingfeedback,7,1.0,False

My doctor increased my dose from 75 mg to 112.5 mg and told me to book a follow up in 6 weeks to reassess. I am now in my 6th week of taking the 112.5 mg, and honestly I feel amazing. The increase in dose has substantially helped with my depressive symptoms. However, the side effects with this increase are making me question if I want to remain on this dose. My side effects with the increase are:

\- Brain fog, I can feel the sharpness I used to have has decreased in the past month. I am making silly small mistakes at work that I haven't before.

\-A constant state of nervous excitement. The best way I can describe is that I've had 3 cups of coffee at once, and I am not energized but just jittery. Not in the physical sense but more so mentally. 

\- Insomnia

Honestly, the insomnia and brain fog are tolerable but the constant state of jitteriness/nervous excitement is extremely bothersome and I truly do not know if that is something I am okay with continuing to feel.

1qikq6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/HungryArtists/comments/1qikq6r/hiring_narrative_tshirt_illustration_academic/,"[HIRING] Narrative T-shirt illustration (academic humor, surreal)","Hi! I’m looking to commission a **single illustration for a T-shirt**.  
The piece is humorous but concept-driven, with a clear narrative and symbolic elements.

**Concept (high level):**  
A sleep-deprived scientist at a cluttered desk is startled by his own wake-up alarm after working through the night, spilling coffee in the process, which startles the cat. The text at the top reads **“I just wanted to have some fun(ding)”**.

**Details to include:**  
These elements are important to the concept, but their exact visual treatment is open to discussion.

1. There’s a laptop on the desk. One screen subtly shows the **Nerpa logo** (Nerpa is the name of a project; the logo is attached).
2. The scientist hallucinates a **nerpa seal**.
3. The scientist wears a hoodie. Under the hoodie, a T-shirt is partly visible with the text **“I just wanted to have some fun(ding)”** (a hint of recursion).
4. There’s a small **sound-effect cue near “(ding)”**, visually linking the text to the alarm.

**Note on subtlety:**  
All details except for the hallucinated seal are meant to be subtle, and it’s fine if they’re missed at first glance.

**Design flexibility:**  
I’m open to adjusting the design if the composition I have in mind proves too cluttered. Whatever design we agree on should tell a coherent story, with details that bear symbolic meaning.

**References:**  
Please find attached AI sketches as a **very rough reference** for ideas and composition — they are not meant to be copied.

**Budget:**  
€100–200, depending on experience and style.

1qikguc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qikguc,"One Year In: Abuse of Power, On Repeat","One year ago, Donald Trump took office. “I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.” And then, approximately 1,500 people were pardoned.

I made a commitment that I would do everything I could to deliver for California, and I am very proud of all that I’ve been able to accomplish. But I also made a commitment that I would stand up to Donald Trump any time he abused his power, sought to undermine our democracy, or tried to divide this country.

And that has been a tall task.

These are the people that Donald Trump pardoned — people he celebrated because they showed loyalty to him. And in Trump’s world, nothing else matters.

We need to remind this administration that a state may be blue or red, but it contains millions of people who are both blue and red.

Donald Trump has made his choice. Elon Musk has made his choice. What will we choose?

The president pressuring his attorney general to go after you, saying, “We have to act now.” Look — I’m not going to be intimidated by anything he says or anything he does. If I were, I wouldn’t be on your show.

If it helps pay for his billionaire tax cuts, it’s all the same to him. He does not care.

Someone has to stand up to this abuse of power. Someone has to defend our country and its people. Someone has to fight back.

I have, and I always will.

Because this fight isn’t over. It’s just beginning. And I won’t back down.

There's a certain magic in grinding whole coffee beans – the release of an intoxicating aroma, the promise of a perfectly brewed cup. While the convenience of services like Amazon is undeniable for many household goods, when it comes to truly exceptional coffee, the story runs much deeper than a next-day delivery. The best coffee isn't just about the bean; it's about the journey from farm to roaster, and crucially, the moment it hits your grinder.

At Intelligentsia, we pioneered **Direct Trade**, building over two decades of relationships with farmers who grow coffee of unparalleled quality. We pay significantly above Fair Trade prices not out of obligation, but because exceptional coffee demands it. Generic beans, often roasted days or weeks before purchase and then warehoused, simply cannot compete with coffee that is **Roast-to-Order**. Your beans are roasted with meticulous care and shipped immediately, ensuring they arrive at their absolute peak for your enjoyment. This commitment to freshness is the bedrock of superior flavor.

Why does this matter for your daily brew?

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our Roast-to-Order model guarantees you're experiencing coffee at its aromatic and flavorful zenith, something impossible with mass-produced, shelf-stable beans.
*   **Ethical & Sustainable Sourcing:** Through Direct Trade, we ensure farmers are compensated fairly and empowered to invest in their farms, leading to consistently higher quality crops.
*   **Exceptional Flavor Clarity:** From the legendary **Black Cat Espresso** with its syrupy body and notes of dark chocolate to vibrant single origins showcasing bright acidity and nuanced fruit notes, our meticulous sourcing and roasting unlock the true potential of each bean.

Elevate your coffee ritual beyond the expected. Explore our curated selection of **Direct Trade Single Origins** or discover the ultimate convenience with an **Intelligentsia Subscription**, featuring always-free shipping. Experience the difference that passion, ethics, and unparalleled freshness make.

It’s been a little over a year since my last version of this rework concept. I think it’s time to revisit the man himself.



Below, I’ve outlined some conceptual power changes that I think would help give The Trapper more consistency and lethality, while also serving to promote more varied playstyles and slightly diminish some of his most oppressive territorial strategies.



I’ve included adjustments and reworks to many existing add-ons, while also adding few new ones and retiring some now defunct ones. A concerted effort is being made to help remove the RNG aspect of Trapper’s power, relating directly to trap Escape attempts, while aiming to buff the Escape and Rescue times to increase the power’s consistency.

[**Trapper Update Concepts - v1.5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadByDaylightKillers/comments/1hokjvf/update_concepts_for_the_trapper/)

\_\_\_

# Power Changes

* The visibility of Bear Traps is now limited based on the Survivor’s proximity to the trap. From 0-8 meters, traps are fully visible. From 8-16 meters, traps are partially invisible, similar to The Wraith’s Cloak effect. From greater than 16 meters away, traps are fully invisible.
* Setting a Bear Trap is now 30% faster.
* When looking at any Bear Trap, a cursor will appear above it. Pressing the *Secondary Power button* will mark that Bear Trap, highlighting it in yellow. The Trapper can mark up to two traps at a time.
* When The Trapper is carrying no traps, the auras of lockers within 36 meters are revealed to him. Searching a locker will cause any marked Bear Traps to be picked up. This interaction takes 3 seconds.
* While a Survivor is caught in a Bear Trap, The Trapper will no longer see their aura. Instead, The Trapper receives Killer Instinct on the trapped Survivor. Killer Instinct will linger for an additional 3 seconds after the Survivor Escapes the trap.
* While a Survivor is caught in a Bear Trap, The Trapper can press the *Secondary Power button* while looking at that trap to create a Hunting Path which leads from The Trapper’s current location to that trap, similar to The Houndmaster’s Search Path.
* While moving along the Hunting Path, The Trapper will move at 6m/s as long as he is not in chase or transporting a body.
* The Hunting Path will fade over the course of 4 seconds once the Survivor Escapes the trap, or The Trapper comes within 8 meters of the trap that triggered it.
* Bear Traps cannot be placed within 8 meters of a hooked Survivor.
* When hooking a Survivor, Bear Traps within 8 meters of the hook will be automatically picked up. If this would increase the number of carried traps over the maximum, instead, the difference over the maximum will be placed randomly on the map in the disarmed state.
* Attempting to Escape from a Bear Trap no longer has a chance of failure.
* Escaping from a Bear Trap now takes 8 seconds.
* While a Survivor is caught in a Bear Trap, they are faced with continuous Escape skill checks, borrowed directly from Wiggle skill checks, but without Great success zones. Successfully hitting Escape skill checks will progress the Survivor’s Escape bar, while failing to hit them will cause it to regress at an equal rate.
* While a Survivor is caught in a Bear Trap, another Survivor may lend them aid by performing the Assist Escape interaction. Doing so will increase the trapped Survivor’s Escape progression speed by 100%. Assist Escape interactions can be canceled at any time.
* Survivors who Escape from a Bear Trap suffer from a 5% Hindered status effect for 8 seconds.
* Disarming a Bear Trap now takes 4 seconds.
* When attempting to Disarm a Bear Trap, the Survivor is faced with continuous difficult skill checks. Failing any of these skill checks will result in failing the attempt, requiring them to start over. Failing to Disarm a trap will not notify The Trapper.
* While a Disarm attempt is in progress, Bear Traps will now still affect any Survivor walking into them as normal, cancelling the Disarm attempt in the process.
* The Trapper is now immune to blinds while in the Setting portion of his Trap-Setting animation. Blind attempts during the Crouching and Standing portions of this animation will still affect him.

* Bear Traps inflict Mangled and Hemorrhage on trapped Survivors for 90 seconds.

**Heavy Spring Arms**

*A set of extra-power spring arms that deliver a punishingly brutal trap closure.*

* Increases the duration of the Hindered effect on survivors who Escape from a Bear Trap by 2 seconds.

\_\_\_

# Very Rare

* Bear Traps within 8 meters of a hooked Survivor will still be picked up.
* Allows for the transportation of up to 10 Bear Traps.

\_\_\_

# Ultra Rare

**Bloody Coil**

*Part sticky, part slippery, this grim liquid makes handling the traps’ springs more dangerous.*

* When a Bear Trap is disarmed by a survivor, the bloody coils exact their price. If that survivor was healthy, they become injured. If they were injured, they are inflicted with Deep Wound.
* Bloody Coil gains a visible debuff icon that is shown to any Survivor attempting a Disarm interaction.

**Iridescent Stone**

*Traps sharpened with the sickly gleaming stone seem to gain a life of their own.*

* Every 30 seconds, one closed Bear Trap, chosen at random, becomes set
* When gathering traps from a locker, all marked traps snap before being picked up, causing any survivors within 16 meters of them to scream and reveal their locations.",4,1768959273.0,DeadByDaylightKillers,1,0.83,False

I remember when I was a kid my dad took me out back of the Colosseum and I ended up getting a bunch of signatures from both the Pens and Oilers. Do they still allow this? I was hoping to give the same experience to my son. 

I got a Lemieux and Coffee signature so this was a few years ago now. lol",5,1768959126.0,EdmontonOilers,5,0.78,False
1qik842,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingstomyself/comments/1qik842/some_days/,Some days.,"Some days I just want to pack a bag and disappear. No more me, no more them, no more of this. 

Some days I can take on the world and’s all the weight of it like it’s a feather. All the things get done and there’s maybe some time to spare. 

Still some other days, most days to be honest, I am on autopilot. I get up, make the same cup of coffee, check the same things on my phone, go to work or don’t, etc. and some things get done while others wait. 

I guess it’s the same for most people, but then again most people have some variance in their days at some point. It seems when I try to change things up or take any amount of time for myself, it’s an issue. This didn’t get done, that appointment was missed because I wasn’t there with my trusty Maps to lead the way. Some simple task was neglected because I wasn’t there to do it. 

So if I just shut up and do what needs to get done, it’s all fine and well. But if I deviate from the day to day, all hell breaks loose because the people who are dependent on me, are too dependent on me and the hell that breaks loose is entirely my fault. 

But I’m so….. burned….. out. My cup is empty, it’s been empty for so long there are cobwebs in it. What another good one? I have no spoons left, I’m in spoon debt as heavy as most people’s mortgages. 

And I still have to go to work tomorrow. And before that drink the same cup of coffee. ",1,1768959087.0,writingstomyself,0,1.0,False

Our months of effort has now culminated in this final moment, thank you mods for supporting us, and the community from all over the world. we received 100 applications from fellow daoists.
