Have you ever met someone who was sunshine in human form? Someone who was poetry encapsulated in a person? Someone whose voice flowed with a cadence that the heavens would be jealous of? Someone so gentle that even the soft breeze on a summer‚Äôs day felt harsh? 

I have. I met someone once who I was destined to miss forever, someone whose nature was sweeter than anything I have yet to taste. They radiated warmth in every way imaginable, from the glow of their skin, the way they spoke to me; to the sparkle in their eyes. Eyes a deep rich mahogany brown, eyes that put the most perfect cup of coffee in the morning to shame. 
I met someone who spoke to me so gently that even a goodbye whispered from their lips felt like a prayer. 

I find myself sitting in the sand, staring off into the horizon thinking of them often. The sand heated from the sun, yet cold in comparison to the warmth of who they are. I watch the waves dance along the shore, the water kissing the sand, destined to leave and return again. I wonder if that has been our destiny as well, to live as if we are the ocean and the land. Always a delicate dance between hellos and goodbyes. 

I met someone who was sunshine in human form, but I am simply the moon, forever changing, waiting for the day we meet again. Waiting for an eclipse, so for another fleeting moment I can feel your warmth. ",1,1734898185.0,letters,1,1.0,False

1hk6jdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hk6jdu/is_this_going_anywhere_need_some_insight/,Is this going anywhere? Need some insight,"Hi all, 23F, I'm starting graduate school in 4 months, moving three hours away. A distant coworker/friend from a job in undergrad (we talked, just not much) reached out to say hi about a month ago. We briefly chatted over text and agreed to get breakfast. Since then we have pretty much met every weekend, coffee and then at a park. They text, ask how my day has been etc. Nothing has been explicitly stated to be a date. They too, are starting graduate school in a few months and they may not end up living anywhere near me. Like. What is the end goal here? I genuinely afraid I'm being immature or naive by not taking action to set boundaries or clarify things-I just have no idea how to navigate this.

I'm just a bit confused, I've never been in a relationship. Hell I can count the number of male friends I've had on one hand, and even then, I never hung out with those male friends alone. And its not like I've been swept off my feet or anything. i think they are nice and intelligent. I don't know... I recently read the Defining Decade, and one of the biggest things was that there is never a right time, that by the time 'youre ready to date', or have kids, or anything, the opportune time will have passed. I feel like dating is something I should be doing at my age I guess-so I say yes to activities and hanging out. I don't hate it. I don't love it either. Like I'm just going through the motions. And like i've said, I'm not even sure if these are dates or the guy doesn't want to put a label on anything.

Sorry this is a ramble, is anyone else my age feeling this confusion and disconnect? What is the mature and respectful way to move forward? I appreciate his time, I don't mind the company, attraction is a foreign concept to me, one I've never felt towards someone in earnest so I don't want to dismiss that idea that could happen here.

So my partner and I met in college. We started as friends w benefits. When he moved back home after graduating, he decided he wanted to be with me. I had told him 6-8 months before he committed that I had feelings for him. In this time, I was cleaning/cooking for him and taking him on dates (dinners/coffee). We did not live together. I fully admit I was doing too much at this point in time and feel as though this created the dynamic we have now. 

Now yall‚Ä¶ a lot was said in this time that made me feel like I was inadequate, crazy, and like I had to change to be good enough for him to be with me. So I did. I didn‚Äôt join the military like I wanted to, didn‚Äôt travel out of the country, stopped going out with my friends to parties and ultimately dropped out of college to move to a different city with him because he didn‚Äôt want to move back and wait for me to finish my degree. I shouldve had more of a spine, but I didn‚Äôt, and was just happy he finally wanted to be with me. 

So now we live together. We have for 6 months. In this time, the only chores he will do (and this is inconsistent) are the dishes and the laundry. Everything else is on me. As a result, I don‚Äôt cook as much as I used to. I don‚Äôt play video games anymore or go out with friends anymore. I work 40-60 hours a week (blue collar work). He works 32 hours, working in a clinic. I‚Äôve been asking him since we moved in together to pick up more of the household work. I told him I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to remind him to clean or build a chore chart each week for him. His suggestion is the chore chart. 

It all kind of came to a head this morning though. We are hosting for my family for Christmas. His is invited but they don‚Äôt want to come (this is also a cause of stress, they do not think I am good enough for him and literally won‚Äôt even look at me, better yet talk to me). Since we are hosting, I have been decorating and cleaning and planning everything. He doesn‚Äôt help. I snapped at him and told him I‚Äôm not his mom and I‚Äôm tired of having to beg him to do simple things around the house. I told him it isn‚Äôt my responsibility to micromanage him. He told me that because of his anxiety he doesn‚Äôt want to do something in case I want to do it‚Ä¶. I really didn‚Äôt know what to say to that. I just kind of stared at him and said they‚Äôre chores and I have been asking for help. He got mad at me and told me he feels like I don‚Äôt speak to him respectfully. I was definitely heated this morning so I apologized and told him I don‚Äôt mean to speak to him poorly. I also told him that I feel like I‚Äôm being pushed to this point, where I snap and am angry, because I feel ignored. I feel like I am crying to someone who is deaf, because nothing changes.

Before him and I got together, I would go hiking and go out pretty regularly. I liked exploring and experiencing new things. He knew that and it was one of the things he found attractive about me. I‚Äôve been asking him to take me on dates (I‚Äôm the only one planning dates and taking us out places). He keeps telling me he will, but he doesn‚Äôt. I told him I‚Äôm not expecting anything extravagant (he literally could take me to a fucking Applebees and id be happy).
He tells me he agrees with me and I deserve to be treated better. He keeps breaking up with me and taking it back. 

I just feel so lost and he‚Äôs making me feel like everything here is my fault. Of course it takes two for a relationship to get this way but I don‚Äôt like being yelled at and hearing him hit things around the house because I‚Äôm asking to be treated better.

Am I asking for too much?? I just wanna be with someone who will show that they appreciate me and take me out and help out. I want someone who has an active role in our home and our relationship and I don‚Äôt feel that with him. He makes fun of me for having no hobbies and no direction in life right now but this is literally why I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I feel like all of my energy gets sucked into taking care of him, working, and arguments. I‚Äôve started leaning more heavily into substances due to the stresses of this relationship and I‚Äôm just worried. I know this isn‚Äôt good or a good place to be but I‚Äôm so confused on what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to get out or if I even want to. He makes me feel better than anyone else and worse than everyone at the same time. The original agreement we had was that if we broke up he would move out, but every time we have broken up he has refused to leave.",0,1734897966.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

We got there at the end of their coffee hour, talked to some people, and saw the inside of the church a bit. Here are some similarities and differences I noticed:

Similarities: similar inside layout, with benches in rows. They had about 20-30 rows front to back of the cogeneration, so it's a similar size to mine. There was a real organ, and the pastor had a stand she talked from. Really nice people, same coffee and donuts.

Differences: female pastor. Afaik, they cannot be pastors, so that interested me a bit. We talked for a bit, she was extremely nice and welcoming. As for the inside of the church: there were 2 floors, main bottom floor, and a little balcony with more seats and a music tech platform. They had 2 places where the pastor and her assistant stood and talked from. There was no altar, so the choir stood where the altar would have typically been. No icons or statues. There was also a piano and parts of a drum set. Different music- more modern and not like our regular worship music. 

Overall, I liked how nice the people were, however I wouldn't go back there for worship. ",1,1734897809.0,OrthodoxChristianity,0,0.67,False

1hk6dlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hk6dlr/my_3_month_review_of_the_kitchenaid_kf8/,My 3 Month Review of the Kitchenaid KF8,"So it's been 3 months since I purchased my KF8 and thought I would follow up on my initial review. The price I paid at the time was $1,439 USD due to a Kitchenaid sale and Bloomingdales running a 20% off sale on top of that. It was the cheapest I've seen that machine for ever at the time and the Friends and Family pricing people are getting now was not around yet. But is important to know I did not pay the retail price of 2K.

When I first got the machine, before turning it on I opened the bypass chute. Then when powering the machine on, it would not complete the startup process telling me the bypass door needed to be closed even though it was. When I called Kitchenaid, they had told me there would be no way to get the machine working and can send me a new, warranty replacement machine. The process was simple. They shipped the replacement the same day and told me to send them back the broken one after I receive the return label. I thought that was great service that they didn't need to wait to receive the broken machine back first. I also stressed I never got to actually try the machine so can I have time to test it and if I'm not satisfied, could I send back the warranty machine to them so I can return the broken machine to Bloomingdales for a refund. They said no problem.

One thing I noticed was the machine that came from Kitchenaid had a note inside saying it was tested at the factory and might have some coffee grounds still present but the machine is 100% a new product. That actually made me feel good that this one would work and was tested.

I wanted the KF8 over the other models because I liked the option for the additional strength adjustments and also if I were to use plant based mik in the future, the option was there. The KF8 at the time was also cheaper than the KF7 when I purchased it after the sale price.

The machine claims 40 recipes. That is deceiving. It's more like half of that. They consider the same drink made with dairy milk or plant based milk two drinks. For me, a cappuccino no matter which milk is used should be considered a one drink recipe but it's not. But that's something to know if you are looking where the missing drinks are.

Sound level of the machine was not a concern for me. While it's not super loud, it's also not silent where it wouldn't wake someone sleeping next to it, but that wasn't going to effect my decision either way. It is said to be quieter than other machines though.

As for looks. It's boxy. I think it has more of an older, industrial look to it over something more modern. I don't think it's the prettiest machine. I got the stainless steel version as that was all Bloomingdales was selling but I think the other colors add more character. Either way, looks was not a deciding factor in choosing a machine. It was going to be the drink quality the machine delivered. The KF8 is heavy, it's metal and feels and looks well constructed. It has wheels in the back bottom so you can easily slide the machine in and out if you needed to.

Let's get milk temps out of the way. Drinks with frothed milk, milk dispenses between 135¬∞-140¬∞ F. That would be for latte mocciato's and cappuccinos. Temp is perfect if you want a hotter drink. For other milk drinks, milk dispenses at around 120¬∞ F. Those drinks will be warm. Black coffee drinks are hot and espresso temp is fine.

So how are the drinks? Well, there this a a lot of customization available and you will want to play with that for each drink. After using the machine for a while I've realized using the highest strength doesn't necessarily mean the best tasting drink. When I would use my semi-auto machine, I would pull a shot with 16-17 grams of coffee with an output of 35-40 grams. I would add that to around 10-12oz of milk for a latte or cappuccino. So why would I use 30 grams of coffee when doing a dual drink with total output of milk around 9-10oz on my KF8. I'm not lookikg for a drink overpowered by coffee, I'm looking for a drink with good balance and flavor in the overall cup. So just putting it out there, don't think you need to always use the strongest strength. An example of my flat white recipe is a dual drink with 1.2 oz espresso shot on strength 3 and milk at 4.5oz. Body on medium and temp on high.

So after dialing in drinks, I really started to enjoy the machine more. I usually only make dual drinks because the max size for single drinks are just too small. I am also someone who likes black drip/pourover coffee and I will say I do enjoy the black coffee recipe. Also, if you want that lighter drip quality in your cup, try lowering the strength of this drink too. It will still pack a lot of flavor but give you more of a drip profile over an espresso profile of flavor and strength. I use freshly roasted light to medium roast beans but if you are someone who just uses dark roast beans and want that burnt flavor of coffee, then I would not follow my tips. LOL ... Straight espresso is nice and balanced. Good flavor. Great crema when using fresh roasted beans.

Having a removable bean hopper is game changer! I have a second hopper loaded with decaf for the wife at night but when I get a new bean I want to try. I just pop out the hopper, spill it back into the bag. Add the new bean to the hopper and run the purge feature to remove any of the old bean left in the grinder. This feature really separates the Kitchenaid machine from other superauto's.

As far as cleaning. I make about 3-4 dual drinks daily on average. I needed to deep clean the milk once so far. Did a descale once and cleaned the brew unit 2x with a tablet. While I do remove and rinse the brew unit once ever week or two, there is nowhere where it says this needs to be done weekly. The only time the machine actually tells you to rinse the brew unit is during the brew unit cleaning process. I guess if Jura tells you their brew unit never needs to be cleaned, cleaning the Kitchenaid brew unit ever few weeks might be just fine. Like I said, no where in the instructions does it say weekly cleaning is required. I think sometimes we just base it off other machines requirements.

The drip tray and puck tray are large. It holds a lot of pucks and waste water in it so you don't need to empty it after 2 or 3 drinks. Water tank is a nice size and can be filled without taking the tank out of the machine. Can just use a cup to pour water in.

My machine is on every day and I have it set for 8 hours before powering off. Have had no issues. The screen is a nice quality. Good graphics and easy to navigate. Profiles are great. You can add names and then save the drinks to their profiles. Milk cleaning is easy. Push the tube into the drip tray and click start. The froth quality is good. No complaints there.

Overall, I'm very happy with the machine. I think the price I paid also plays into the value of the machine vs. other machines at the same price range. Now to see if it stands the test of time.",2,1734897670.0,superautomatic,0,0.75,False

   * Given V67 info should be up by EmojiBlitzerGurl in early Jan, I'll probably take an hour and set up such reminder for Feb. and March, too.  Those are not time intensive to make, can be scheduled in advance, and I think can be super helpful to folks!
* On Reddit: I've got the individual event discussion posts set for thru the Survival Game Jam Event

ü§î **But don't get your hopes up, as this does NOT mean my other extensive post types will continue by me in 2025!   I didn't want you all to see a few posts in January and think I've changed my mind on retiring!**

üö´üó£ Last, as part of my retirement process, I intend to shut off all messaging methods/capabilities and notices, on all forums.  That includes direct messaging options, notifications after being tagged in posts, etc.  This is part of a broader transition off of social media platforms and a return to the real, live, outside world üå±üåè instead of the online world üåê.  I may even archive or delete profiles on some platforms.

* Given the upcoming holidays, I might just go ahead and do that before December 31st!

I've been putting this at the end of my retirement announcement posts to take a moment to say I've really been humbled and appreciative of the community coffee donations since I made this virtual tip jar (at some of your suggesting!) in January 2023. Your thanks is much appreciated and, for the record, my coffee budget is quite large and the overall thanks received hasn't exceeded my annual coffee expenses. So it really can all be attributed to actual coffee!

My symptoms have always been mainly the constant feeling of needing to pee and soreness post-urination. Two cytoscopies showed a lot of vessels (an inflamed bladder) but no Hunner‚Äôs lesions.

The main things that help me are solifenacin which is a muscle relaxant (have been on it for a year) and valium intravaginally, also AZO.

I get flareups from coffee, stress, sex and orgasms in general. Not sensitive to diet overall.

I have recently started pelvic floor therapy. I had two visits for now and it‚Äôs been mainly focused on deep breathing, meditation and overall relaxation etc. I have kegels as my homework which I‚Äôm unsure if thats safe. The main issue I want to resolve is post-sex flares yet she has not done ANY internal examination. And overall I feel like its too vague of an approach, about relaxing the whole pelvic floor rather than pinpointing specific muscles that spasm. She did not mention wands or dry needling or any of the other things I see on this forum that seem to help.

She claimed she knows IC but would all of this signal that I should search for someone else? Or should I specifically ask her for internal examination and a more in-depth approach?",1,1734897636.0,PelvicFloor,1,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôve ever considered enhancing your smile, you‚Äôve likely encountered the term ‚Äúdentist teeth whitening before and after.‚Äù Teeth whitening treatments by dental professionals can bring dramatic changes to your teeth and overall appearance. Seeing the transformation through images can be truly inspiring, and for many, it can lead to a boost in confidence and self-esteem.

Many people struggle with tooth discoloration due to various factors. These can include age, food and drink consumption (like coffee or wine), tobacco use, or even certain medications. It‚Äôs understandable to want a whiter, brighter smile, and professional whitening services offer a solution that is often much more effective than over-the-counter options.

Before considering teeth whitening, it‚Äôs crucial to understand your current dental condition. A dentist will evaluate the health of your gums and teeth to determine if you‚Äôre a good candidate for the procedure. This initial assessment is a vital step in ensuring your results will be both safe and effective.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Here's what you can generally expect during a dentist teeth whitening session:

1. **Consultation:** Your dentist will discuss your goals and explain the different options available. This may include in-office whitening or at-home kits.
2. **Preparation:** The dentist will clean your teeth to remove plaque and debris. This step ensures that the whitening agent can work effectively.
3. **Whitening:** A whitening gel or solution is applied to your teeth. In-office treatments may also involve a special light that activates the whitening agent for faster results.
4. **Aftercare:** Post-treatment care instructions are provided. This can include avoiding certain foods and beverages to maintain your new smile.

Now let‚Äôs explore the ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù aspect that captures most people's attention. Many dental practices showcase successful transformations to highlight the effectiveness of their teeth whitening services. These images serve as real-life proof of what you can expect.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Typically, you might see stark contrasts between the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù images. The ‚Äúbefore‚Äù pictures often show stained, dull, or yellowed teeth, while the ‚Äúafter‚Äù images reveal bright, white teeth that look healthy and vibrant. The difference can be as remarkable as several shades, and viewing these transformations can provide motivation for anyone considering the procedure.

Engaging with these images also helps prospective patients visualize their potential results. It‚Äôs essential to note that individual results may vary. Factors such as the initial shade of your teeth and your overall oral health play a role in the final outcome.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
To maintain your newly whitened smile, consider the following tips:

- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day and flossing regularly.
- Avoid foods and drinks known to cause staining, including coffee, red wine, and certain sauces.
- Quit smoking or using tobacco products, as they contribute significantly to discoloration.
- Consider using whitening toothpaste for additional maintenance.

Another interesting point to consider is how whitening treatments can positively impact your professional and personal life. Many individuals report feeling more confident in social settings and workplace interactions. With a brighter smile, you may find yourself smiling more often, which can be contagious!

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Furthermore, the confidence boost from a whiter smile can extend beyond personal interactions. Many people believe that an attractive smile enhances perceived professionalism and trustworthiness. This perception can be a game-changer in job interviews or important business meetings.

However, it‚Äôs important to have realistic expectations when considering dentist teeth whitening. While many patients experience incredible results, some may experience temporary sensitivity after treatment. This is normal and can usually be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
The impact of dentist teeth whitening before and after is profound. Witnessing genuine transformations can motivate you to pursue this effective cosmetic dental option. With professional guidance, you can achieve a brighter smile that not only changes the color of your teeth but also enhances your confidence and outlook on life. So, if you‚Äôre considering teeth whitening, take that step and reveal the smile you‚Äôve always wanted.

Understanding the Science Behind Dentist Teeth Whitening Treatments
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular treatment among those looking to enhance their smiles. If you've ever wondered about the process, it‚Äôs essential to understand what happens during professional whitening treatments performed by dentists. This knowledge not only helps you make informed decisions but can also enhance your overall dental health. Let‚Äôs delve into the science behind dentist teeth whitening treatments.

### The Basics of Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening primarily works by using bleaching agents that penetrate the enamel, the outer layer of your teeth. The most common agent used is hydrogen peroxide, which breaks down stains and discoloration into smaller, less visible particles. Here‚Äôs how the process typically unfolds:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Preparation:** Before the procedure, your dentist will evaluate your dental health to rule out any issues, such as cavities or gum disease.
- **Cleaning:** A thorough cleaning of your teeth ensures that there are no plaque or tartar buildup which can affect the whitening process.
- **Application:** The dentist applies a protective gel to your gums to minimize sensitivity and then applies the whitening solution.
- **Activation:** Some treatments use light or laser to enhance the whitening effect, accelerating the breakdown of stains.
- **Rinse:** After the treatment duration, usually 30 to 60 minutes, the dentist will rinse your mouth and check the results.

### Understanding Stains and Discoloration

Teeth can become stained for a variety of reasons. Understanding these factors can clarify why professional whitening treatments are effective:

- **Intrinsic Stains:** These originate from within the tooth, often due to aging, genetics, or exposure to certain medications like tetracycline.
- **Extrinsic Stains:** These are surface stains caused by external factors such as smoking, food, and drinks like coffee or red wine.

Professional treatments focus on breaking down both intrinsic and extrinsic stains, leading to a more even and brighter appearance.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### The Role of Concentration

The concentration of hydrogen peroxide used during professional whitening is significantly higher than what you find in at-home kits. This is crucial for effective results. Here‚Äôs a look at the concentration levels:

- **In-Office Treatments:** Dentists typically use concentrations ranging from 25% to 40% hydrogen peroxide.
- **At-Home Kits:** Over-the-counter products usually have only 3% to 10% peroxide, which may lead to gradual results.

This difference in concentration is why many homeowners find professional treatments more effective for achieving noticeable results in a shorter time frame.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Post-Treatment Care

After your whitening session, it‚Äôs essential to follow some care guidelines to maintain your newly brightened smile:

- **Avoid Certain Foods:** For at least 48 hours, steer clear of staining substances like coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco.
- **Use a Straw:** If you do consume staining drinks, use a straw to minimize contact with your teeth.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing will help keep discoloration at bay.

### Potential Side Effects

While professional whitening is generally safe, some individuals may experience side effects. Understanding these can help you manage expectations:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Tooth Sensitivity:** Some people may feel temporary sensitivity after treatment, which usually resolves within a few days.
- **Gum Irritation:** If the whitening agent comes into contact with gums, irritation can occur, though it is often mild.

It's a good practice to discuss any concerns with your dentist prior to treatment.

### Choosing the Right Approach

Ultimately, the most suitable whitening method depends on individual needs and the condition of your teeth. Consulting with a dentist allows for a personalized approach tailored to achieving the best results safely.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Understanding the science behind dentist teeth whitening treatments not only sheds light on how effective these procedures can be but also emphasizes the need for proper care afterward. A brighter smile awaits, just one professional treatment away!

### Conclusion

Dentist teeth whitening treatments can truly transform a smile, as evidenced by numerous before and after cases. The real-life transformations people experience highlight not just the aesthetic benefits but also the confidence boost that comes with a brighter smile. Whether it's for a special occasion or simply to enhance daily life, these treatments are designed to deliver noticeable results that can uplift one's appearance and self-esteem.

Understanding the science behind these treatments further illuminates their effectiveness. Professional whitening usually involves stronger bleaching agents compared to over-the-counter options, allowing for deeper and more immediate results. Dentists also tailor the application based on individual needs, ensuring both safety and maximum effectiveness.

Have been pulling great shots with this machine and an Encore for years, Virtuoso+ had been performing fine as well. Recently purchased some beans while traveling which, once I tried them at home, I started to suspect they were stale. Flavor wasn't great, water was flowing a little fast.

After a week or so of using them up, shots started spraying so severely that I was lucky if half the pull landed in the cup, very little crema. Pucks were stuck tightly in the filter as if they didn't pressurize properly and spread moisture evenly, had to be removed with a spoon. Examined the grind and noticed it definitely looked much more coarse than usual on the same setting.

Things I've done as part of general maintenance and diagnosis:

- set grinder to zero to get as fine as possible
- switched to another bag of beans marked three weeks old
- reseated upper burr and checked alignment
- cleaning cycle in both machines (vinegar, urnex)
- cleaned inside of shower in the group head, which had a thin layer of coffee buildup
- replaced group head gasket
- adjusted grinder calibration screw to finest setting

Video of the grind and shot, this was the last attempt before adjusting the calibration, which also didn't solve it, although these steps got the puck dense and even enough to release properly.

Since I have started going, there has been this one guy who works there (lets call him D) who has always been really friendly to me. At first I thought he was just being nice because I was a regular, but then I realised that some of the stuff he did seemed a little flirtatious. For example, I always hear him say to his co workers how he wants to specifically make my drink, and he always brings it to me (instead of normally leaving it at the side and shouting the order number). He also tries to obviously make eye contact with me, and my friends have noticed him look at me whenever he walks past. He also tries to always say goodbye to me whenever I leave (I thought this was normal but he never does it to my friends who go there more than I do). He also sometimes upgrades my drink size for free and will let me know about it too. I really cant tell if hes just being nice to me or actually likes me.

Backstory: 
My best friend (M26) and I (F26) have been friends for a few years. We initially started off as friends and then turned into fwb. I developed feelings, he never liked me back, eventually he started dating someone else. 

They broke up and we resumed our fwb situation, but it wasn‚Äôt consistent. I moved away for work and we just hooked up when I came back for the holidays. 

Now: I‚Äôm back for the holidays and I met their very cute friends at a party (M28). He‚Äôs charming, polite and we vibed so well. He made a move and I said I need to have a convo with my best friend (didn‚Äôt mention why). The cute guys said that they spoke about it a few months earlier when I saw my profile and said ‚Äúgo for it‚Äù. I still said let‚Äôs leave it here and meet up later in the week over coffee or something. 

My best friend has been seeing people over the past few months because obviously we aren‚Äôt exclusive or anything. I asked him if it was cool if I met the cute guy and initially he acted very nonchalant about it and said - ‚Äúdo what you gotta do, don‚Äôt involved me, it‚Äôs cool. ‚Äú

Today: we‚Äôve been having an argument over text and he‚Äôs been making snarky comments the situation. I texted him to meet with him and see his family before I leave and he made a remark about why don‚Äôt I spend time with his cute friend instead. And it‚Äôs been this kind of comments the whole day. 

I continued to ask him to tell me if it‚Äôs making him uncomfortable and I would back off. He just says not to involve him but I obviously care about his feelings. I don‚Äôt want to just hook up with his friend, I‚Äôm genuinely interested in getting to know him and I‚Äôd like to date him in the future. 

Is this morally wrong of me? Am I breaking the bro code? If we dated, I‚Äôd get it - but we never did. Someone please tell me how to navigate this. I don‚Äôt want to lose my best friend but this isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs been weird about things like this. ",1,1734896733.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I feel so weak and pained and scared and sad. I can‚Äôt hold it together and I don‚Äôt know how anyone does this. I keep thinking I may not live. That my life is shortened. Everything is gone. I‚Äôm stage 3 and so so so scared. Christmas is ruined. And I‚Äôve only just recently been diagnosed with only one chemotherapy under my belt. I have at least seven more before surgery. I‚Äôm already so overwhelmed.

I‚Äôve always been terrified of needles and blood draws and injections. My chemo is spread out over 21 days but even now I‚Äôm losing sleep over getting my next blood draw. I almost passed out last time.

I just want to feel like myself again. Wake up and not hurt. Jump out of bed and start my coffee and enjoy my day. Not be painful or sad or scared.

You might drink to help you fall asleep but you invariably wake up 3 hours later and can't go back, or you black out and sleep for 8 hours but wake up not feeling rested. Sometimes during binges something even worse happens, when you're constantly on the verge of falling asleep, having those absurd thoughts right before fully entering sleep, and then you wake up with a jolt. Hours upon hours of that loop, never fully falling asleep. 

BUT, I wanna share something else. This year I've been feeling drowsy every day around 3 or 4 pm. No matter what I did (light lunches, lots of coffee, walking after lunch, even on days where I had slept 8 9 hours the night before), drowsy every day. I also feel very sleepy at night, it's almost impossible to stay awake past 10 pm (where I live we're used to going to bed pretty late, midnight on a weekday).

I recently went to a neurologist and did a sleep study test, and it turns out my sleep cycles are completely screwed. The doc showed me the graph, and I barely got any REM sleep, even though I usually sleep several hours a night. It's never deep sleep. This year I've gone without drinking several long stretches (1, 2 and 3 months) and I still had this problem, it didn't get fixed by itself, no matter how much or well I think I sleep. So he gave me 2 types of medication, a heavy dose of melatonin for the night and armodafinil for the morning, which I have to take daily for a couple months. He said it depends on the person but it might take two or three months for the sleep cycles to rearrange. He said this is usually caused by stress or emotional related issues, or it could be the stress of long periods of time of unfitful sleep, such as alcohol related.

So, if any of you still has sleep problems, even now being sober or during sober stints, you might wanna get this checked out. As with so many other health related issues, it might still be affected by alcohol even long after quitting drinking. Like I mentioned, at one point I hadn't drunk for three months, three months of what I thought was really good sleep, and still suffered from this.",13,1734896023.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

(Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I am a college kid who goes to ECSU (Eastern) so running shows frequently isnt in my cards just yet, but we have a fantastic show coming up January 4th! A ton of planning and love has been put into it so far so this is our lineup!

We have 5 awesome pro wrestling matches coming including a 25+ person rumble with some crazy stars including Grims Toy Show on Youtube (1.3+ Million on Youtube) Along with the five matches we have a TAG TEAM DEATHMATCH between rivals who have been battling each other for YEARS, a true battle of ideologies. We also have a WORLD title match that has 3 WORLD titles on the line!

Alongside the wrestling we also have 2 comedians coming for sets, vendors for old wrestling figures, a coffee truck and more!

I would absolutely love to see people there January 4th, a Saturday at 4PM! We are at 662 Coe Avenue East Haven CT behind the buildings in the warehouse (don't worry we have heat)!

1hk5s83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kochi/comments/1hk5s83/demanding_money_in_the_name_of_christmas_carol/,Demanding Money in the name of Christmas Carol.,"Being born and brought up in Kochi, Christmas Carol was an integral part of growing up. Me and my friends would literally wait for Christmas to arrive to go for Carol. It was so much fun and everyone in the neighbourhood used to enjoy it. We always made sure not to hurt or disturb anyone. Even though we used to get money, we made sure that they are giving wholeheartedly and they also become part of our fun. 

Now coming to the situation, me and my friend were coming back home in his car when we noticed a group of young lads blocking the road and demanding money from people in the name of Christmas Carol. They were literally dancing in the middle of the road causing public nuisance and can clearly tell most of them were high. Well, we kind off let it go as this is once in a year occasion and cherished our childhood memories. They were not letting anyone pass until they were given money. But still, we saw it as fun and google payed them the amount and left. 
We then stopped at a coffee shop (small outdoor chayakkada) for tea. After few minutes, these guys came to the shop and started demanding money from the customers. They were all playing loud music and were dancing disturbingly while people were having food. Then one of the guy came and asked my friend for money and then he left when we informed him that we already paid. Now, another guy came, who was not at all in his sense and started demanding money. We decided to keep quiet and enjoy our tea and thats when he said to my friend that ""Ninte adutha varsham mudinju pokum (your next year will be doomed"". He didn't stop there and went on to tell his friend that ""Avanu cash thannal entha. Tharathavare O*kki vidanam"". He then came back and again said same thing. I was literally angry but since we were out numbered we decided to keep ourselves calm and not to cause a scene. 

These type of events not only put bad image to Kochi but also to the innocence of Christmas Carol. We could clearly see now many people actually don't entertain christmas carols anymore compared to back in the days. How do you guys see Christmas Carol and what you guys would have done in such a scenario ? ",6,1734895932.0,Kochi,3,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Christmas is almost here and I've got essentially 8 days of me, myself, all the beige foods in the world and some alcohol, join me?

so anyway, about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows. I'm a terrible flirt so apologies in advance.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

    Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon

(Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

[https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9](https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9)

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I've dubbed this the ""Title Project"" - going around from band subreddit to band subreddit to determine whether or not a given artist's song has its title in the lyrics.

[Don't read too much into the color choice, a song with its title not sung isn't of worse quality.](https://preview.redd.it/rrzqcxem9g8e1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=362a93dc65b889ed658648f43abe296b4a93f21e)

Curiously, most of the abstract song titles are from *The Party Scene* and other pre-major label releases from the band. Although, there is a small handful of ""red songs,"" yet none from *Future Hearts* onwards.

With the exception of [Radiohead](https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/1fon9k8/does_the_radiohead_song_have_its_title_in_the/), I'm fairly certain that All Time Low has the highest number of songs with multiple titles that I've covered so far. They really enjoy their parentheses! A couple of songs kind of threw me for a loop, I encountered some new situations I'd never had to consider before while doing these.

""Old Scars / Future Hearts"" is a song I'd consider to have two titles, denoted by the /. However, I equally could have thought of it as one title, which would've rendered it yellow as opposed to purple. I think viewing the song as having two titles is fair, seeing as if they wanted it to be read as ""Old Scars and Future Hearts,"" they could have used ""and"" or ""&.""

""January Gloom (Seasons, Pt. 1)"" had me asking whether or not the ""part 1"" should be considered a part of the ""Seasons"" title. I ultimately decided that no, it doesn't. I applied the reasoning in this manner as thus far, I don't consider parts of the title that denote a version or edition of the song to be a part of its actual title. This is why I don't include ""(Demo)"" or similar things while doing these.

Anyways, enjoy the spreadsheet. Be sure to correct me on any mistakes I might've made!",8,1734895455.0,alltimelow,2,1.0,False

But she does beg me for her ""breakfast"" in the morning when I'm making my own, or making coffee. If she doesn't get at least something, she pouts and is grumpy for the rest of the day. I had been giving her maybe 1 of the Temptations Purree tubes in the morning, and she snarfs that down.

What I'm asking, ""What should I look for in cat treats so it doesn't mess up her diet?"" I have no problem moving into human food sources for her.

Additionally, she has arthritis, but it doesn't slow her down too much, she'll still jump nearly 3 feet vertically to get up on my bed (I have a cat stairs that should arrive today).  
Edit: Partial Thought. I'd like something to help with this too, if possible.

I have a poke bowl place where I can get high quality raw fish, I was thinking I could steam some of the salmon chunks, add a little water or something, then blenderize that for a Christmas treat.

1hk5kua,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/1hk5kua/icarus_ai_solutions_icrs_could_soon_see_gains_of/,Icarus AI Solutions ($ICRS) could soon see gains of 300% by January (DD Inside)üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"**Not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before you invest.**

Icarus AI Solutions ($ICRS) had a a recent run up this week,¬†**from $0.84 on Monday to $1.68 at close of trading Friday**, after they were¬†**awarded a $63 million contract from the US army**¬†to strengthen their supply chain resilience levels. They specialise in AI-powered decision making software as a service (SAAS) alongside a subsidiary operation developing quantum cryptography solutions.

* **Market Cap - $84.23 Mil**
* **Current Price - $1.68**
* **52-Week Range - $0.10‚Äì1.6**

**1. Recent Developments**

* Recently awarded a¬†**$63 million contact from the US army**¬†to strengthen their supply chain resilience levels.
* Reported net profit of $0.2 EPS in their latest earnings report, achieving profitability for the first time in 18 years.
* Partnerships and Acquisitions:¬†**Potential acquisition rumours**¬†abound that one of the magnificent 7 may acquire them.

**2. History**

* Originally founded by Earnest Graham in 2006 as a textile manufacturer in San Francisco, just like Berkshire Hathaway. $ICRS was created to meet the growing demand of clown costumes, as San Francisco was undergoing a boom in Circus-related corporate events at the time.
* The company pivoted to¬†**developing AI based solutions**¬†when clowns were heavily scapegoated during the 2008 financial crisis and demand fell.
* After Earnest Graham's passing from an unfortunate bout of death, current C.E.O Dr Craig Kent took over in 2015 and increased R&D by $20 mil using non convertible notes.

**3. Detailed Financial Analysis**

* Until recently the company has historically struggled to achieve profitability due to a¬†**heavy focus on cutting edge Research and Development,**¬†as well as ongoing issues with rising lunch costs. However they have started to have larger contracts trickling in, with the largest one being a¬†**$63 million contract from the US army**,¬†**as well as a coverted $20 dollar contract with an anonymous fast food outlet in August 2024.**¬†Although speculation is rampant on the identity of the restaurant, the general consensus is that the first letter of the restaurant chain begins with one of the 26 letters of the alphabet, one of the main reasons the company has recently been given a price target rating of $3-4 next year by price analysts.
* Gross margin has started to rise over the last quarter, driven primarily up by strong sales from VoIP and SaaS. They expect revenues to double once they conclude the R&D stage of their quantum cryptography research.
* Markets:¬†**Operates primarily in North America and Europe**¬†(Excluding Luxemburg), as the the C.E.O Dr Craig Kent has been banned from numerous countries due to his¬†**bold, mission driven approach**¬†to starting bar fights at multiple airport lounges. Unfortunately Dr Kent is under house arrest, but turning lemons into lemonade has encouraged a healthy WFH culture with employees, regardless of forced confinement.¬†**Employee satisfaction is up**¬†to double digits, with staff morale at an all time high in the last quarter.

**4. Growth Drivers for next 5 years.**

**a. AI-Driven Decision Making**

* As more and more businesses look to outsource human intelligence to machines, the demand for¬†**high-level autonomous decision making**¬†is set to boom by $800 billion by 2030AD. Recent successes of Palantir and [BigBear.AI](http://BigBear.AI) have shown that investors have a keen interest in this area, and all signs show that this demand will accelerate over the next 5 years, aside from 2027.
* **A high level partnership with NASA in 2023**¬†to optimise their vending machines has allowed the appliances to make decisions that can override the employees request to have a beverage in exchange for revenue. This has resulted in a 57% reduction in coffee payouts over the last financial year,¬†**saving NASA a whopping $2 million over the last year**. Although employees have started to speak to their unions about being denied a product they paid money for and were¬†*entitled*¬†to coffee after the purchase, $ICRS was able to outsource the dissenting individuals's functions and roles to their¬†**machine learning software,**¬†saving NASA even more money.

**b. Quantum Cryptography**

* Although it's in its early stages of development,¬†**quantum cryptography is set to modernise the IoT and blockchain industries.**
* Strong emphasis on numbers and math.
* Demand set to skyrocket in the next 10 years, depending on if people finally understand what quantum cryptography is actually about.
* Will allow your password to be in two places at once, as well as being simultaneously strong and weak.

**5. Potential Risks**

* Stock is highly volatile due to heavy short selling, as well as heavy dilution over the last year.
* $ICRS has only recently achieved profitability recently, which means they may not have as much cash on hand in case of events.
* As the company is entirely fictitious, it is harder to acquire larger amounts of capital to support their¬†**cutting edge research and scalable AI solutions.**
* The C.E.O is set to depart at the end of next year, so their successor will need to know how to scale up 10x to achieve profitability.

In summary, $ICRS is¬†**ready to take off next year**. To the moon? No, to the sun.¬†**With projected gains of 300% by January**, $ICRS is fully capable of becoming a surprise competitor to Palantir and BigBear.AI.

1hk5jnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/1hk5jnd/seeking_adviceto_leave_or_not/,Seeking Advice--to Leave or Not? ,"Hello all, I'm seeking some godly advice. My wife and I are not Reformed, although I have some Reformed leanings, but I see a lot of theologically mature discussions in this sub and feel like I can come here for as sound advice as you can get from strangers. 

We go to a non-denominational church that my wife started going to before we were married and while I lived out of state. I started attending with her when I got back a little over a year ago, and we just got married by the church in the fall. 

Unfortunately in that time I've noticed a lot of what I see as seeker sensitivity in this church. Some of it I can be OK with. A concert-like worship experience, a coffee bar, an excited pastor, topical sermon series. However I feel like much of it is either watered down or bad theology. My biggest example of this is our worship set--often singing songs like See a Victory, Do It Again, Raise a Hallelujah... Stuff that seems to border on Word of Faith theology. But the church has great community and is full of people that I would say genuinely love Christ. There are even some occasional nuggets of gold in some of the sermons for more mature Believers. 

Today, however, really bothered me. First, the band played that classic Christmas hymn Jingle Bell Rock in the worship set. Then the sermon was on Isaiah 9:6 and the Gospel was presented around Jesus being ""Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace"" in our lives and chaos and circumstances. Sin was mentioned, but not emphasized, just about needing forgiveness to not be separated from God and to receive eternal life. The word ""repent"" was not used. 

We've prayed about leaving for some time now, but circumstances haven't been favorable. As I mentioned, we just got married there in the fall. I was also recently asked to join the band and am scheduled to play in the coming weeks. Additionally the church just took a huge offering to pay for down payment and renovations on a building the church is purchasing to move to. 

Do you think these things are worth talking to the pastor about, or even leaving the church? I want to be humble in this, knowing I haven't got everything figured out. It just sets off a lot of alarm bells. Even though they have the primary things right, I feel like there's a lot of secondary stuff that could lead the new Believers (that is, most of the church) astray. And as a husband, I know I am responsible for the spiritual health of my family. So any advice is appreciated. 

Thank you in advance, and have a blessed Christmas.

1hk5i2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hk5i2j,"Information about the histamine-estrogen cycle, in case this is of any help to you","I‚Äôd recommend researching the histamine-estrogen cycle if you‚Äôve noticed that antihistamines help during your luteal phase. I asked ChatGPT to explain why MCAS could cause PMDD and it‚Äôs says that if your body is fighting histamine overload it has a harder time processing excess hormones, which furthers the cycle. So essentially, reduce liver strain + hold back histamines + improve estrogen methylation and the cycle in theory should straighten itself out. I did not do any fact checking but a lot of advice it‚Äôs given corroborates with things I‚Äôve seen recommended here as well. Take with a grain of salt.

Even if you don‚Äôt have MCAS your liver could possibly be overloaded from toxic products (detergents, fragrances, skincare, medications), bad food (leftovers, uncleaned coffee pot/cookware/utensils, improper processing in factories especially for nuts and beans), bad water (rusty or moldy pipes), or bad air (mold or chemical scents). 

I am going to focus on this and track my menstrual cycle for the next few months and report back. I‚Äôve already noticed that my hirsutism (no mustache), cramps (absolutely 0 cramps), vestibuldynia (still a problem if provoked), and breast tenderness (0 breast swelling) during luteal has improved this month since taking tampons (pretty damn toxic) out of the equation and remembering to take antihistamines after ovulation. Still have nerve pain, brain fog, and fight or flight episodes on the first days of my luteal phase and my goal is to fix that completely. I still remember how my PMS used to be (just fatigue, mild irritability and some tenderness) so I will see if I can return to that. I am currently living in an old house with a room that‚Äôs been compromised by mold so I am doing the best I can to mitigate the problems and recover from extended exposure.

I‚Äôve noticed that eating or drinking certain things might affect them for a couple of days like drinking coffee or green tea. These will make them go away for a couple days but after 4-7 days, they‚Äôll be back full swing..


I guess my question is to those that had issues with erections after SSRIs. Did they eventually come back? And if so, did your libido eventually come back as well..

Our life is finite. The most limited resource is time. I am 30 now. My father died at 45.

I completed all the main life quests. I have wife and my lovely little son. I have education, some sort of successful career. I have some basic things for comfort - a flat, a car, etc. I have some savings I don't have to work for food.

The main question is - what next?

Up to a certain period of time we walk along a large well-known road, but then it ends abruptly.

How to understand where to go next? At the same time, the life timer is ticking, and time can end at any moment. 

I think there are two options here:

1) Philosophy of humility. try to find comfort in what you have and learn to appreciate life as it is etc.

2) Find a wall (passion) and break through it with your head.

To be honest, for some time I tried to convince myself of the first option. But the more I tried, the more I realized that it was all nonsense.  I have ambitions I don't want to end up like an ordinary NPC. But I also understand that I don't stand out in any way. 

I spent 10 years pursuing a career in IT before I realized I wasn't into it. I quit my job and want to find a new passion. I like coffee so I'm going to open my coffeeshop. But I'm not sure about it.

my best friend (16f) is super sweet, but she doesn‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ get it, if that makes sense? like, she‚Äôs nice and all, but sometimes i feel like she‚Äôs just coasting through life without thinking about the bigger picture. for example, the other day she posted on her insta story about how excited she was to get a pumpkin spice latte from starbucks. i was honestly shocked because i thought we both agreed that starbucks is super problematic (labor exploitation, palestine, union-busting, etc). so i texted her and was like, ‚Äúhey, maybe you should think twice before promoting companies like that.‚Äù

she didn‚Äôt respond right away, and when she did, she said something like, ‚Äúi just wanted a latte. it‚Äôs not that deep.‚Äù which‚Ä¶ wow. it *is* that deep? i tried explaining to her how every purchase we make is a vote for the kind of world we want to live in, but she just kept saying things like ‚Äúokay but i‚Äôm not going to feel bad for wanting coffee.‚Äù i even offered to send her a list of better local cafes, but she said those are too expensive.

then things got worse. yesterday, she showed up to school wearing a jacket from SHEIN.

long story short, she ended up storming off and hasn‚Äôt been answering my texts since. a couple of our mutual friends are saying i was too harsh and that i need to let people live their lives, but like‚Ä¶ is it really that hard to just *try* to be a better person? i‚Äôm not asking her to change everything about her life, just to be a little more conscious about her choices.

1hk58q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1hk58q9/lost_my_cuddle_friend/,Lost my cuddle friend,"m30 here. For a bit of background, I had a decent number of friends growing up. However, due to mental health issues in HS that led to stunted social development, along with some other unsavory personality and behavioral traits on my part that stemmed from undiagnosed ADHD and trauma, by the age of 22 I'd lost contact with all of them, with a few short-lived resurgences here and there that amounted to nothing. 

Since then, things were tough socially. I did have some good online friends and some short-lived work acquaintanceships, and a few dates that never went anywhere, but otherwise I was pretty socially isolated and lonely. 

This past summer I finally made my first irl friend since splitting from that group 8 years ago, on a site called CuddleComfort, where, essentially, people look for platonic cuddle buddies. 

She was younger than me at 22, so I always let her be the proactive one in our friendship. She was the one to suggest meeting for coffee for the first time, she initiated holding hands first, she invited me to cuddle in her bed first. I know that some might criticize me for the age gap, but believe me when I say there wasn't much of a maturity gap. If anything, we complimented each other in several ways, and it felt like a healthy, balanced dynamic. I was the only one who drove, but she was better with directions, and we both showed each other around our respective neighborhoods - that sort of thing.  

We had a decent amount in common, from ADHD and barren social lives, to some overlap in music taste (we both liked going to concerts) to interest in Japanese anime/games, to tastes in food, to intense adoration for cute animals, and appreciation for long walks and adventures. 

Over the course of the summer, we went to a rock concert together, cooked together and for each other, cuddled and played video games, watched anime and movies together, began to learn to massage each other since she had chronic pain and I wanted to help, went on walking adventures around our city together, met each other's pets/humans and all got along, and more. We hung out maybe 10 times, and we always seemed to have fun. I know I always did. We always shared long, genuine hugs before we parted.

Everything was going well until this past fall semester started. In the past, she had mentioned having fairly severe mental health issues which were often exacerbated by school, so I can't say it was a complete shock, but as the weeks after the first day of school piled up, she seemed to become more and more distant and I got more and more anxious. Plans to hang out got canceled, I became the only person to reach out first, and her responses got shorter. I know I should have seen all of this coming and backed off, but I can be bad at taking hints sometimes without the other person being direct.

After two weeks in a row of her being sick (I was always sympathetic and understanding) I simply asked her if she'd like to hang out sometime soon, with the caveat that I assumed she was busy with school and work and that if she didn't have the time or energy that I'd totally understand and that there was no pressure. Maybe this message wasn't ideal but I trusted her to just say ""no"" if she wasn't able to or was still sick. But I do look back and fear that I was coming across as too pushy and that maybe I just should have asked how she was doing or left her alone instead. Anyway, she never replied to that, and 3 months later, I still haven't heard from her. 

I am self-aware of the fact that I have attachment issues stemming from the aforementioned loss of all my friends - anxious attachment to be exact, and I believe that she is more on the avoidant side because a lot of those pieces just seem to fit together. So there was definitely some paranoia and separation anxiety on my part, without which I may have been more able to just give her space (even though she never asked for it). Though, in my defense, this was partially exacerbated by the fact that we had a lot of plans for October. We were going to go to a concert together, go to my cabin for a weekend, I was going to volunteer to have her practice some dental work on me for her schooling, and she also invited me to her graduation party which I assume will take place sometime soon. Towards the end, in addition to wanting to see her, I really just wanted to get together and talk to her about these plans and if she was still able to make them, but we never had that chance. I could have asked over text but it seemed like the kind of thing that would be better to discuss in person. 

I reached out twice more, once to ask if we were still doing the dental thing (I had talked to my dentist about it and everything) and once, a few weeks ago just to say hi and show her a cute sticker I found that reminded me of her. But nothing. 

The uncertainty of whether or not I'll ever hear from her again has been weighing on me heavily, and kind of driving me crazy. So I've been trying to just accept that things are over, but this has been leading to some pretty intense grief. And I can't help but wonder if I was a bad friend towards the end at a time when she was probably struggling. ""Maybe if I had just asked her how she was doing instead of asking her to meet up, she would have felt more seen"". That kind of thing. 

I don't know what kind of feedback I'm looking for, but I just wanted to share this story to get it off of my chest and maybe help someone who's gone/going through something similar. Thank you for reading. ",2,1734894409.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

>[$25 budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22%2425%20budget%22)

>Going to a Christmas party with some friends of friends. They requested to bring a $25 gift for a gift exchange and said make it something nice. I‚Äôm not normally someone who re-gifts, but I have recently received a small charcoal grill and a panini press from work and don‚Äôt have use for either. They are both at least $25. Would that work or are either a bad idea or what should I bring instead?

While re-gifting can work, it depends on the context and the quality of the items. Here‚Äôs a breakdown and additional suggestions:

# Re-Gifting the Grill or Panini Press

* **Small Charcoal Grill**: If it‚Äôs new, in great condition, and comes with all its parts, this could work for someone who enjoys cooking or outdoor activities. Wrap it nicely with a bow and perhaps include a note like, ‚ÄúFor grilling up great memories!‚Äù
* **Panini Press**: Similarly, if it‚Äôs new and well-packaged, it could be a great gift for someone who enjoys cooking or loves sandwiches. You could even attach a recipe card for gourmet paninis to make it feel thoughtful.

**Caution**: If you‚Äôre unsure whether the crowd would appreciate these items, or if they look too obviously re-gifted, consider these $25 alternatives:

*  **Market Cap - $84.23 Mil**
* **Current Price - $1.68**
* **52-Week Range - $0.10‚Äì1.6**

**1. Recent Developments**

* Recently awarded a **$63 million contact from the US army** to strengthen their supply chain resilience levels.
* Reported net profit of $0.2 EPS in their latest earnings report, achieving profitability for the first time in 18 years. 
* Partnerships and Acquisitions: **Potential acquisition rumours** abound that one of the magnificent 7 may acquire them.

**2. History**

* Originally founded by Earnest Graham in 2006 as a textile manufacturer in San Francisco, just like Berkshire Hathaway. $ICRS was created to meet the growing demand of clown costumes, as San Francisco was undergoing a boom in Circus-related corporate events at the time.
* The company pivoted to **developing AI based solutions** when clowns were heavily scapegoated during the 2008 financial crisis and demand fell.
* After Earnest Graham's passing from an unfortunate bout of death, current C.E.O Dr Craig Kent took over in 2015 and increased R&D by $20 mil using non convertible notes.

**3. Detailed Financial Analysis**

* Until recently the company has historically struggled to achieve profitability due to a **heavy focus on cutting edge Research and Development,** as well as ongoing issues with rising lunch costs. However they have started to have larger contracts trickling in, with the largest one being a **$63 million contract from the US army**, **as well as a coverted $20 dollar contract with an anonymous fast food outlet in August 2024.** Although speculation is rampant on the identity of the restaurant, the general consensus is that the first letter of the restaurant chain begins with one of the 26 letters of the alphabet, one of the main reasons the company has recently been given a price target rating of $3-4 next year by price analysts.
* Gross margin has started to rise over the last quarter, driven primarily up by strong sales from VoIP and SaaS. They expect revenues to double once they conclude the R&D stage of their quantum cryptography research.
* Markets: **Operates primarily in North America and Europe** (Excluding Luxemburg), as the the C.E.O Dr Craig Kent has been banned from numerous countries due to his **bold, mission driven approach** to starting bar fights at multiple airport lounges. Unfortunately Dr Kent is under house arrest, but turning lemons into lemonade has encouraged a healthy WFH culture with employees, regardless of forced confinement. **Employee satisfaction is up** to double digits, with staff morale at an all time high in the last quarter.

**4. Growth Drivers for next 5 years.**

**a. AI-Driven Decision Making**

*  As more and more businesses look to outsource human intelligence to machines, the demand for **high-level autonomous decision making** is set to boom by $800 billion by 2030AD. Recent successes of Palantir and BigBear.AI have shown that investors have a keen interest in this area, and all signs show that this demand will accelerate over the next 5 years, aside from 2027.
* **A high level partnership with NASA in 2023** to optimise their vending machines has allowed the appliances to make decisions that can override the employees request to have a beverage in exchange for revenue. This has resulted in a 57% reduction in coffee payouts over the last financial year, **saving NASA a whopping $2 million over the last year**. Although employees have started to speak to their unions about being denied a product they paid money for and were *entitled* to coffee after the purchase, $ICRS was able to outsource the dissenting individuals's functions and roles to their **machine learning software,** saving NASA even more money.

**b. Quantum Cryptography**

* Although it's in its early stages of development, **quantum cryptography is set to modernise the IoT and blockchain industries.**
* Strong emphasis on numbers and math.
* Demand set to skyrocket in the next 10 years, depending on if people finally understand what quantum cryptography is actually about.
* Will allow your password to be in two places at once, as well as being simultaneously strong and weak.

  
**5. Potential Risks**

* Stock is highly volatile due to heavy short selling, as well as heavy dilution over the last year.
* $ICRS has only recently achieved profitability recently, which means they may not have as much cash on hand in case of events.
* As the company is entirely fictitious, it is harder to acquire larger amounts of capital to support their **cutting edge research and scalable AI solutions.**
* The C.E.O is set to depart at the end of next year, so their successor will need to know how to scale up 10x to achieve profitability.

  
In summary, $ICRS is **ready to take off next year**. To the moon? No, to the sun. **With projected gains of 300% by January**, $ICRS is fully capable of becoming a surprise competitor to Palantir and BigBear.AI.

  
Please do your own due diligence. Hope you all make money!

I have been trying Tinder, had a few matches, but each one faded out quite quickly. I was losing hope and ready to erase it. At this moment, a girl matched me, and she was everything I could have expected, and the type of person I know who I would got along with well. It seemed we were in for the same type of things, as we matched under the category serious relationships, and we both had long term on our profiles. 

For two weeks we would message late every night, she would always ask about my day, me, my passions and vice versa. She often initiated the messages and would say how she wanted to leave Tinder and had a bad time with ghosting, just like me, and to take things slow, without expectations. She said that she only commits and discusses to one guy at a time.

I had plans for a date, but she surprised me asking before I could. This coffee date went well, we laughed, we smiled at each other, she got close to me, I stroked her shoulder while saying goodbye. She also would talk how much her side job of waitress was a burden because of another colleague, and that going to the restaurant without telling her would be a relieving surprise. (We are in Europe, so she didn't earn any more money from it) So I ate there, everything went well, she served me, we talked a bit about Christmas and our family reunions and she stroked my arm goodbye. 

Meanwhile her messages stopped and she would respond nicely but evasively.

Then today she told me she decided it was not a good idea to continue because during those moments she was feeling not at ease and that I ""imposed her a closeness she did not agree and wanted"" and that this was a red flag because she clearly told me that she wanted no expectations too soon. Sorry but her being excited about visiting things together or learn things together, saying that she would accept any proposition to hangout, aren't expectations? She told me that the stroke I did was a red flag, while I could have said the same about the arm stroke in her logic. But no her arm stroke is because she is welcoming and I did not read the room, while mine was obviously an extremely intimate act I guess.

The final joke was that when I told her that I may have been clumsy while she did not react about it, and that looking for serious relationships, a first little error during the first date should be excused if she was interested and that some dates are necesary to know more someone, she answered that her instinct does not need time to know and that she had never told me she was looking for a long term relationship, let alone romantic and that I have never asked her and imposed her my expectations. On Tinder. Under the serious relationships tab. With long term on her profile.

Because of the massive fight we had, where she was racist and then denying the fact that she was. And then treating my friend who had nothing to do with the situation like absolute crap. So I got angry and upset at this behavior. 

But she keeps blaming me for her reaction, which has been to send me spreadsheets with reimbursements I was supposed to pay her, and then demanded I giver her the coffee table back that she said I could have. 

And she keeps acting like she is justified in all her actions, but really, she's the one in the wrong. She can't admit it, though. Which is so sad to me. Because what sort of example is that to set for your child? That you can never be wrong and they have to apologize to you for your behavior? I don't have kids and never will, but if I was a parent, I would never treat my child like that. If you're a parent, you signed up to love and support your kid forever, not on terms and conditions.
 
It just shows me that they never really supported me in the first place, if I was never allowed to question their authority or call them out on bigoted behavior. But they pretend to be so progressive, even though it's just lip service, clearly. It's scary to see how quickly this managed to be destroyed when any parent who is emotionally mature would have handled this situation with grace and care. Like, ""Thank you for correcting me on something I was unaware of, I'm sorry I caused you pain. I will do better in the future."" Like, it's not hard. 

I guess now I'm just grieving the loss of this relationship I thought I would continue to have as I got older. It doesn't erase all the good times. But it's the present situation that I can't look past. 

I used to look up to her as a role model, and it's embarrassing now because she's never going to be the role model I imagined. And the radio silence since I told them to give me space is nice but also. It's like they just don't care. And now other family members are aware of the situation but nobody is asking me if I'm ok. Like the lack of compassion is hurtful. 

I think maybe they're all used to my mom and I being so close, and once I refused to play this part, they don't know what to do. 

She will keep saying she's the victim, as if I was the one abusing her. But the power dynamic here shows that is not true.",2,1734894242.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

Let's face it, coffee is the lifeblood of many. That rich aroma, the comforting warmth, and that invigorating jolt ‚Äì it's a ritual, a necessity, an addiction even. But there's a dark side to our beloved brew, a less-than-pleasant consequence that can put a damper on even the most caffeinated conversations: coffee breath. We're going to delve into the bitter truth about coffee and bad breath, exploring the science behind the stink, offering practical solutions, and ultimately, helping you enjoy your coffee without sacrificing your social life. This isn't just about quick fixes; it's about understanding the root causes and equipping you with the knowledge to combat the coffee breath monster once and for all. We'll be looking at everything from oral hygiene to dietary changes, debunking myths, and offering tips and tricks you can implement right now. So, grab your mug, settle in, and let's get to the bottom of this aromatic enigma.

Coffee and Bad Breath: Unmasking the Culprit
--------------------------------------------

We all know that coffee can stain our teeth, but why does it also leave our breath smelling less than fresh? The answer lies in a complex interplay of factors, starting with the coffee itself. Coffee beans contain sulfur compounds, which, when roasted, contribute to that characteristically rich aroma. Those same sulfur compounds, however, also interact with bacteria in your mouth, leading to the release of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the primary culprits behind bad breath. Think of it this way: coffee beans are like a delicious but sneaky double agent, delivering both the delightful aroma and the ingredients for a breath assault.

### The Science Behind the Stink

Now, let's dig a little deeper into the nitty-gritty science. Coffee's acidity also plays a significant role in bad breath. A lower pH in your mouth creates an ideal breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria. These bacteria thrive in acidic environments, breaking down food particles and releasing those pesky VSCs. It's like creating a microscopic stink bomb in your mouth with every sip. Furthermore, coffee's drying effect on the mouth exacerbates the problem. Saliva acts as a natural cleanser, washing away bacteria and food debris. Reduced saliva flow means less cleaning action, allowing bacteria to linger and multiply, intensifying the bad breath.

- **Key takeaways:** Coffee's sulfur compounds, acidity, and drying effects all contribute to bad breath.

Coffee and Bad Breath: Taming the Beast
---------------------------------------

So, how do we combat this coffee-induced halitosis? Luckily, there are several effective strategies to keep your breath fresh, even after your morning cup (or three).

### Hydration is Key

One of the simplest and most effective solutions is to stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps to wash away odor-causing bacteria and counteract coffee's drying effect. Think of it like rinsing out a coffee mug ‚Äì the more water, the cleaner it gets. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, especially after your coffee fix.

### Oral Hygiene Hacks

Maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial. Brushing your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing daily removes food particles and plaque, minimizing the breeding ground for bacteria. And don't forget your tongue! The surface of your tongue can harbor a significant amount of bacteria, so give it a good scrub with a tongue scraper or your toothbrush. It might sound a bit gross, but trust me, it makes a world of difference.

- **Pro Tip:** Keep a travel-sized toothbrush and toothpaste handy for a quick refresh after your coffee break.

Coffee and Bad Breath: Beyond the Basics
----------------------------------------

While hydration and oral hygiene are essential, there are other strategies that can further enhance your breath-freshening efforts.

### Chew on This: Sugar-Free Gum and Mints

Chewing sugar-free gum or sucking on sugar-free mints can stimulate saliva production, helping to wash away bacteria and neutralize bad breath. Opt for xylitol-sweetened varieties, as xylitol has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain bacteria.

### Dietary Adjustments: What You Eat Matters

Surprisingly, your diet plays a significant role in your breath freshness. Certain foods, like onions and garlic, are notorious for causing bad breath. Limiting your intake of these odoriferous culprits can make a noticeable difference. Incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet can also help, as their high water content contributes to saliva production.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Coffee and Bad Breath: Debunking the Myths
------------------------------------------

There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding bad breath, so let's clear up a few common myths.

### Myth 1: Mouthwash is a Cure-All

While mouthwash can temporarily mask bad breath, it doesn't address the underlying cause. Think of it like putting a band-aid on a broken bone ‚Äì it might cover the problem for a bit, but it won‚Äôt fix it. In some cases, alcohol-based mouthwashes can even worsen bad breath by drying out your mouth.

### Myth 2: Stronger Coffee Means Stronger Breath

The strength of your coffee doesn't directly correlate with the intensity of your breath. While darker roasts might contain more sulfur compounds, it's ultimately the interaction of those compounds with bacteria and your individual oral hygiene that determines the outcome.

- **Fact:** The best way to combat coffee breath is to address the underlying causes: bacteria and dry mouth.

Coffee and Bad Breath: The Long-Term Solution
---------------------------------------------

Ultimately, the most effective long-term solution for coffee breath is a combination of consistent oral hygiene, proper hydration, and a healthy diet. Think of it like a three-legged stool ‚Äì if one leg is weak, the whole thing becomes unstable. By addressing all three aspects, you can enjoy your daily coffee ritual without worrying about offending your colleagues, friends, or, well, anyone within sniffing distance.

### Listen to Your Body

Pay attention to any changes in your breath. Persistent bad breath can sometimes indicate underlying health issues, so it‚Äôs always a good idea to consult with your dentist or doctor if you have concerns. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment options.

### Don't Ditch the Coffee, Ditch the Breath!

Remember, you don‚Äôt have to choose between your beloved coffee and fresh breath. By implementing these simple strategies, you can have your coffee and breathe easy too! What could be better than that?

----------

Looking for guidance, advice, reassurance, anything","I‚Äôve been with my bf for 3 years. He‚Äôs increasingly had a drinking problem. He‚Äôs an alcoholic. The past four days he‚Äôs really been trying to get sober, he‚Äôs withdrawing right now, symptoms aren‚Äôt that bad he says. Everything just feels different. 

I‚Äôve been at work all these days as I work 12hr shifts and pulling OT because I support us both. When I come home he‚Äôs quiet, doesn‚Äôt talk much (he‚Äôs very talkative), lays on the couch watching tv, doesn‚Äôt start conversation with me or make witty banter like he usually does. He doesn‚Äôt touch me when we sleep, he usually does. He doesn‚Äôt wake up in the morning with me to make my coffee while I get ready for work (something he chose to do lol). I‚Äôm used to him feeling needy and asking for reassurance all the time so him being quiet is so‚Ä¶.off putting. 

Rationally, it‚Äôs him changing because he‚Äôs withdrawing and he‚Äôs just trying to make it through the day. 
I have abandonment issues and now my brain is telling me he‚Äôs leaving me. I, myself, have thought about leaving because if he continues to drink, that‚Äôs not someone I want to marry. It‚Äôs so different when I feel like he‚Äôs leaving me, or like he‚Äôs falling out of love with me. 

I feel incredibly selfish thinking this but I can‚Äôt help it. 

On top of everything, I‚Äôm getting an infection and can‚Äôt take time off work to get antibiotics -because I need the money- and it‚Äôs making me resent him because he doesn‚Äôt work. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to feel like I am taken care of too. I take care of everyone in my life, I take care of people at my job as a hospice nurse. When is it my turn to have someone love me and want to be with me? Why can‚Äôt my bf see that alcohol is ruining us? Why am I not enough for him?

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",7,1734893589.0,abovethenormnews,1,1.0,False

1hk4rpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1hk4rpt/working_mama_feeling_lost/,Working mama feeling lost,"I know this is only adjacently related to being a working mom, but this sub will have good advice.

I'm ending the year in a bit of a mess. My husband's work has finally tipped me over the edge. He is a Civil Engineer in consulting. He is a Section Manager, and so he has 50 staff or so. The hours are nuts. Yesterday, he finished a project where he worked 6 weeks straight. No days off.

For context, I'm a VP at a tech company. So I also have a big demanding career. I earn slightly more than him, but once his paid overtime is counted he earns a lot more. We have two kids: 7 and 11. I'm 42, he's 45.

We had a giant argument yesterday (which was Saturday). He had told me Friday was the last day he'd be working on this 6 week project. Saturday we had plans to go to a Christmas market (I planned it but he agreed). Saturday comes and he says ""I only need 3 more hours to work and then I'll be done"". Four hours go by. I go into his office to remind him we need to leave and we get into a huge argument about his work and just... everything. I leave crying with the kids to go to the market. He doesn't come.

Once I get home (8pm), he's still working. I put the kids to bed and we talk. I ask for marriage counseling he says no he doesn't want to. He says that his work project is finished now and we are almost finished with our home renovation project (the other area he's been spending his time) and so therefore the problem is solved (i.e. no need for marriage counseling). It's not from my perspective. 

We've been together for 25 years and married for 15. We have a pretty harmonious relationship. He's OK at division of labor (i would say 55/45 split) but I do most of the ""management"" tasks and he executes. His work hours have always been an issue but I have mostly tried to focus on the good in the relationship. He's the guy that my friends say ""wow what a great husband"". He's coaching sports teams, and doing 100% of drop offs, and 50% of pick ups, making half the dinners, and doing all the dishes while I put the kids to bed. So there's a lot to love. I enjoy spending time with him and we have always had a great, fun friendship and romantic connection.

However...however. I'm starting to realize that the harmony in our relationship might be due to me minimizing my needs. He is a good partner at executing but it's me behind the scenes coordinating, putting kid pick ups on his calendar, and reminding him it's time to pick up the kids when he's immersed in his work. I also don't feel he puts effort into our relationship. I do all of the emotional labor like initiating conversations, check ins with him, remembering our anniversary and planning date nights. 

He tries to meet my emotional needs, in his way. Like this morning after our argument, he came down and said a nice good morning. He made coffee for me and brought me the mug. I was planning the Christmas menu and he participated in that, agreed to what he would make, and we put together a list of things to do and split them up. He took the kids to their 10am activity and will pick them up afterwards. But he'll never be the guy who expresses his love with words.

I've lay in bed this morning and decided 2025 is going to be the year to try to see if this relationship can evolve to better meet my needs. Right now I plan to reintroduce the idea of marriage counseling in a couple of months. Maybe I'll go to marriage counseling by myself. (I've been in individual counseling already about 4 times over my life). Other ideas I have are to focus on myself more. If I need to work late, I'll tell him ""I'm working late tonight, please deal with the kids"". I can commit to a weekend solo trip this year and already have a girls trip planned in February. I want to learn tennis this year. I'm going to do that.

**What keeps you from writing?**

Time and schedule are of course our go-to excuses. We need more of both. Yet these factors may be controllable to a degree. Can you change your schedule or create more time? Can you get up an hour earlier? Stay up a couple of hours later? Change your shifts? Use your lunch break? You can find more strategies right [here](https://coverageink.com/how-to-get-those-pages-done/).

**Establish your no-fly zone.** Kids are notorious for not respecting boundaries. They don‚Äôt give a whit if you‚Äôre trying to be creative ‚Äì far more important that they show you how they‚Äôve not quite-figured out how to do a handstand. This is where you need to lay down the law and establish your **Do Not Disturb Time.** During those hours, mommy or daddy is not to be interrupted. Period.

And if peace cannot be found at home, go to the library or the coffee shop. You may need to be a bit militant about this. But one way or another, claim your space and stick to your guns.

**Are you staring at a blank page? Having a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to write‚Äù moment?** Make a new folder on your desktop titled IDEAS. Whenever you come across something that interests you‚Äìa saying, news story, interesting person or situation, a fun logline‚Äìput it in there. When you need inspiration, look at your folder.¬†

**Are you working on a script but can‚Äôt find a way forward?** Maybe you have to go back to basics and revisit your outline. Is your structure solid? Your protagonist the master of their own actions and actively pursuing a goal? (Lookin‚Äô at you, *Killers of the Flower Moon.*) Your plot logic solid? Do you know your characters well enough? Do you need to do more research on this world?

Once I was working on a TV pilot with a great, quirky lawyer protagonist ‚Äì but had no idea how he could plausibly win his very guilty-seeming client‚Äôs freedom. It took several weeks of research, but I found an amazing true event that worked perfectly. Dropped it in and boom, the whole thing came together. Without that research ‚Äì nope.

**Allow yourself to write shit.** Do you write something and then immediately delete it? Or don‚Äôt write at all because you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve got a killer idea yet? The ‚Äúvomit draft‚Äù is your friend. Just get words on paper in any way, shape or form. Worry about sculpting them into something cogent later.

Remember, this is only a draft. There will be many, many more. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect right off the bat. No script ever is. Allow yourself to create the sandbox you will then get to play in. The more you spew, the more your brain will look at the puzzle pieces and see what connects, and what doesn‚Äôt. And the best part is, by allowing yourself to be bad, you‚Äôre jump-starting the creative process, and all the hesitation and self-doubt may just blow away, replaced with a newfound rush of creative electricity.

I couldn‚Äôt gain access onto the road, as someone was parked over the lowered curb, so; we had to go back, cross at the lights, walk up the path on the left hand side & cross at the lights again (opposite Castle Gardens). NGL, the place was absolutely packed with people, so I had to manoeuvre my chair very carefully & I had to keep my eyes glued to the path to ensure I wouldn‚Äôt run over someone‚Äôs foot. At one point, a child (barely old enough to walk & no eyes watching) almost walked into the back side of my wheelchair. My sister was a bit frustrated, adding that if she got hurt, her family might‚Äôve tried to blame me. Regardless, it wasn‚Äôt my fault, as I don‚Äôt exactly have rear/side-view mirrors to help see what‚Äôs behind me. Anyway, we decided not to stay very long, as it was very overwhelming for me. Being autistic, it‚Äôs difficult to cope with the extremely large crowds & the noise levels are often so bad; I‚Äôm forced to play my ‚Äúfave Apple Music playlist‚Äù through my headphones (via iPad), in order to keep me from stressing or having an anxiety attack. We stayed there long enough to get some nice pictures, but my sister saw I was getting very tensed up & decided it was time for us to leave there. I did agree to let her get one more video, but not before she had me park in a quieter spot just outside the fence, where I could sit quietly for a few moments (to have a little vape & drink from a small bottle of Coca-Cola my sister purchased earlier). Once she‚Äôd finished recording her video, we headed straight for Bow Street Mall again. My sister & niece had a quick browse in 2-3 shops at the entrance, then I suggested going to Costa Coffee. Since I had ¬£50, I decided to pay for my niece & sister to order whatever they wanted (as well as getting myself a hot chocolate, topped with thick cream, caramel & festive red/green sprinkles). My sister got a regular hot chocolate to warm up (with cream & a little gingerbread biscuit), but my niece fancied a cool drink with caramel & ice-cream, plus a sweet treat (a brownie or something similar); which I was happy to pay for, as I rarely get to spoil my nieces & nephews like this. When I got the change, I had about ¬£34-something & since I knew my niece wanted to do some more shopping, I gave her the change I had, leaving me with exactly ¬£30. At first, she didn‚Äôt want to accept it, but I told her how I regret not being able to do stuff like this with her very often (as I‚Äôm mostly bed-bound, only going out in the wheelchair once or twice every 2-3 months) & that I certainly won‚Äôt miss ¬£4. To see her little face light up (first with an üò≤ & then the biggest smile, followed by a hug & lots of thank-you‚Äôs) was the best Christmas gift she could‚Äôve given me, plus she was thanking me for the early Christmas present I‚Äôd given her just before we left for our night on the town; a hardback illustrated copy of ‚ÄúThe Secret Garden‚Äù, a cute little notepad with a fancy pen & a very nice colouring book that is based on ‚ÄúThe Wizard Of Oz‚Äù (which tells the whole gist of the story, with lines on every page alongside the images to colour, so it‚Äôll be a beautiful little storybook once every page has been coloured). Anyway, once we finished up our drinks, we continued to shop for a little while. My niece got some stuff from Primark, as she had to do a ‚ÄúSecret Santa‚Äù with some of her school friends & at first I browsed with my sister, but then decided to park myself outside the shop until they were finished (to be fair, I was getting a bit lightheaded from circling around the aisles & I also wanted to avoid an anxiety attack). When they did come out & then decided to browse Dunnes Stores next, I decided to go into ‚ÄúSweetie Miller‚Äù & hopefully find a couple things that I might like to take home, plus I love to look at all the plushies (whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquishmallows‚Äù or ‚ÄúTy Beanie Boos‚Äù, I have a soft spot for those adorable plushies). I managed to find one book I liked, a pack of Tayto Curry Chips (from my childhood), Walker‚Äôs ‚Äúsausage & ketchup sandwich‚Äù flavour (50p, plus I was curious about how it would taste), KP Mini Chips with Salt & Vinegar flavour, cola-flavoured ‚ÄúBig Baby Pop‚Äù (also from my childhood), English creamy toffees & a couple of Nestl√© Toffee Crisp bars ‚Ä¶ & for once, I resisted the temptation of buying another plushie! LOL. My niece & sister found me there, so after my sister grabbed a fresh can of Boost energy drink from the cooler in Sweetie Miller & paid for it, we went for the car-park & then headed home. My little chihuahua was so glad to see me home & my mum was especially glad that I had such a good time. By that point, I was already feeling sore, so I got changed, got into bed & my mum gave me all my meds. Finished the night with a good movie on Prime Video, tucking myself & my little chi under the blankets, then had some of the goodies I bought. I‚Äôd say that night out turned out quite nicely! üòäüíñüéÑüôå",132,1734892325.0,northernireland,23,0.98,False

**Story so Far:**

* *The Whales battle a Lifebane Titan*
* *The mice intercept giant insects known as ""crystoliths"" trying to capitalize on the distraction. Seeing their numbers, the mice get straight to business and engage in chemical and guerrilla warfare,*

\_\_\_

‚Äú*Ninety-Six, Twelve, Eight.*‚Äù the little imp in the background hissed, as if taunting Aymon of his stolen memories.

‚ÄúSilence imp!‚Äù Aymon cried ‚ÄúStop speaking in numbers!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs helping us, Aymon.‚Äù Gwen said ‚ÄúAnd the longer you take to remember, the bigger the price we must pay to the imp.‚Äù

""What about Shihno?"" Philia probed, Gwen rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThe Scroll was in Shihno! I gave it to you! What happened?‚Äù

""Your grace... I don't think he even remembers properly!"" Gwen mock-protested.

""But we did!"" The elf protested.""You were there! Her grace was there! We..."" he paused to clutch his head. ""We were to assassinate the nobles of Freid and pin it to Veles. That was your...""

‚Äú*Twenty-two, Forty-Two, Six-Hundred Fifty-Seven.*‚Äù The imp growled in the background.

""No more of this weird kobold medicine. Gwen."" Philia said with surprising calmness. ""Whatever they did to him to Freid, ensured he can no longer tell us about the Scroll of Temblor...""

""No! I do remember! I can...!"" Aymon said, standing up. He felt a hand grab his from behind.

He almost stumbled as he realized he was looking down a cliff somewhere in the Eastern Elion-Nosco badlands. Somehow he was standing.

""Aymon! What's gotten into you?"" Philia shouted in surprise. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt read the Scroll of Temblor if you‚Äôre dead!‚Äù

""Y-your grace! Pardon me!"" Aymon apologized, quickly backing away.

¬†

He looked around, unsure of his surroundings. Why was he here again?

""You passed out."" Gwen said ""You did it, you launched the Satellites into the air!""

*Satellites! Oh right! That's what Philia called those artifacts that would destroy Elion-Nosco.* He used his telekinesis to send the whole accursed lot high into the air, the ordeal had knocked him out.

*I should have been lying down then,* he thought to himself. *Why was I walking around?*

Philia and Gwen huddled together, looking at a gray tile, it was rather large, like the ones one would see on a patio, they were looking at it like one would read a book.

""There we go! Houston, we've entered orbit!"" Philia cried happily, jumping up and down and giddy like the young girl she was.

""One small step for Terragalia, One giant step for me! ME!!!!"" Philia laughed, continuing to hop around happily. ""Who won the space race? Me! Nyahahahaha!""

Aymon staggered over to see the side of the tile that Gwen was looking at, maybe it had some kind of strange riddle carved into it, or some enigmatic carving.

It took him several seconds to realize he was looking at a vantage point from high above the sky, the vantage point continued to climb and climb. He saw the red and tan soil of the badlands, steadily falling away to reveal vast expanses of green wilderness, blue rivers and grey cities, he saw the land continue to shrink until the ocean surrounded everything.

And then the ocean gave away and the world curved around, revealing a sphere that floated listlessly in a vast abyss.

Gwen's legs buckled at the sight of the world shrinking beneath them, the elf and the ciltran sat down to prevent themselves from falling over but their limbs were shaking.

""This... this...is the world?"" Gwen said in disbelief and fright.

Philia continued to laugh and skip around, not bothering to look. ""It sure is, Gwen!""

Aymon looked up at Philia with dread. ""Wh-what are you?""

Philia stopped her childish celebration and looked at Gwen curiously. ""What's wrong with Aymon?""

Gwen composed herself. ""I think the drugs are starting to wear off. A lot quicker than I expected but that's the thing with elves.""

""Oh, right."" Philia, relaxing visibly. ""I'm guessing it's going to take a while to remember everything... I'm Philia Elion-Nosco.""

""I remember that!"" Aymon said, gritting his teeth as his head started pounding with pain. ""I'm your assistant, assigned to protect you! What drugs are you talking...unghhh...""

""Do you remember that thing I once said about me being reborn from another realm?"" Philia said, calmly pacing around with her hands behind her back.

Aymon laughed as he rubbed his head. ""Yes..."" despite the headaches he found it funny that despite acting very mature for someone very young, Philia still had childish fantasies.

""Humor me on this,"" Philia said as she continued to pace in circles ""Back in my old world, we‚Äôve sent beyond the sky observers like those satellites, so we know what our world looks like from the outside. As a matter of fact, it‚Äôs common knowledge. Children younger than me know of it as fact. Also, we‚Äôve long sent people to the moon, and we have probed even more distant planets beyond that dark abyss.‚Äù

The two listened to her in silence. Her tone didn‚Äôt look like she was lying.

‚ÄúWe call it outer space‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not a pleasant realm to be in. It‚Äôs so cold, no air to breathe, and without the air this planet shields itself with‚Ä¶ why the very rays of the sun would mutilate your body, like a mortal standing before the presence of a God.‚Äù

Philia lightly kicked away a rock that was in her path and continued pacing in circles with a playful childish gait.

‚ÄúNow here‚Äôs something more pertinent, we had something called MK-Ultra, it was a method where they would rewrite someone's memories and even their personality, it had a lot of possible uses... for example, it allowed you to assist me in my little projects while keeping the whole thing secret from Raldia... even though you had to regularly report to him personally.""

Aymon sat up straight. How did she know?

""Because you told me."" Philia said, as if divining his thoughts. ""To be honest, I originally planned to make you just tell Raldia one inane report after another. But..."" Philia tapped her temple ""You were also quite a brilliant mage... most people were under the impression I wanted to learn as much magic and become a wizard, but in reality, my interest in the matter wasn't that deep.""

Philia paused to let the words sink in, brainwashing? Philia seems to imply that she had put him under some spell that had been tampering with his mind. If his mind was being tampered with some foul magic, then surely Raldia would have known. He goes to visit him regularly of course, as matter of fact. Even if the Old Palace was pitch black, all he needed to do was climb the Rose staircase three stories up, take the west wing and turn right on the third corridor five rooms down‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶into Philia‚Äôs bedroom.

The King‚Äôs chamber, or that of anyone important wasn‚Äôt in the Old Palace.

Eyes wide with panic, Aymon looked back up at Philia.

""I decided to put your skills as a wizard to better use. Today, you've launched my Satellites into orbit, now free of most of this world's gravity, they will ceaselessly patrol the heavens above.""

Aymon felt something wrong with that statement.

""Patrol for what?""

""A bird's eye in the sky."" Philia explained. ""One of them's a spy satellite, so now I have a vast unblinking eye surveying all that is in this world, the others? Well, to simplify it... after I bring a few more things into this world, I can communicate with others no matter where they are. All thanks to you.""

Aymon blinked, these artifacts she was talking about seemed too good to be true. She said she had tampered with his mind, was she planning to monopolize the power of these artifacts for herself?

*Aymon, you fool!* He chastised himself. *What have you done? Why did you let Philia-*

‚ÄúJust a little more, work with me!‚Äù Philia said as they both channeled their mana. He and Philia unleashed a torrent of their mana into the portal. Aymon once again nearly lost his balance, but righted himself as he continued to channel his mana into the spell.

‚ÄúCome on, Aymon!‚Äù Philia yelled, ‚ÄúThe Scroll of Temblor is in one of them!‚Äù

The elf shook his head and yelled, he didn't know what was occupying his thoughts earlier. The portal was opening, the ‚ÄúSatellites‚Äù that Philia warned him about were now visible from the dark chamber of some unknown banal temple.

Slowly, with his telekinesis he carefully lifted all twenty of these horrible artifacts, out of their sanctuary and into the sunlight, out here in the badlands.

Even if they failed, Philia told him, Elion-Nosco will have plenty of time to prepare and stem the damage.

Suddenly, the whole chamber was flushed in a crimson light and a piercing shriek from some unknown creature echoed within.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to unleash the fiends in them!‚Äù Philia shouted, ‚ÄúWe must take them out into the sunlight where they can‚Äôt harm anyone!‚Äù

The portal collapsed on itself with a loud crack of lightning, the impact shoving them backwards.

The elf, panting, quickly got up and helped Philia to her feet. The little princess casually dusted herself, ignoring the now dead men she had used to brunt the massive cost of summoning the satellites.

Their faces looked familiar, but Aymon‚Äôs sudden onset of a headache occupied his thoughts. Were these men bandits? When did he subdue them? Why did they have the royal livery of Elion-No-

‚Äú\[Yeah, Baby!\]‚Äù Philia exclaimed in an unknown language; though his interpretation spell translated it without issue, the princess raised her fists as she observed the huge metal objects in front of her. Basking in the sunlight, he could now see these ‚ÄúSatellites‚Äù clearly. They were a jumble of odd shapes, like odd decorative trinkets artisans would do to show off their ability to cut, mold, and weld metals back together. Some even had decorative frescoes over it, with Philia ogling the image of a human. There was an almost religious reverence as she suddenly knelt and prostrated herself before the image.

‚Äú\[Woohoo! Alright, let‚Äôs take these babies into orbit!\]‚Äù Philia said excitedly, padding over to their luggage and taking out rejuvenation potions. ‚ÄúDrink, Aymon! We got a job to do!‚Äù

¬†

The elf snapped himself out of his reverie. In horror he realized that he had pulled those accursed artifacts from Philia‚Äôs old world. He glanced at the bound, dead bodies that were sacrificed to enact her vile ambitions.

""What about Freid?"" Aymon cried in panic. ""Why did we waste time over some useless artifacts!? We need to stop...""

""We stopped them, Aymon."" Philia replied, grinning. ""We massacred a gathering of nobles, poisoned the air of the city and pinned the blame to Veles.""

""That was three years ago!"" Aymon protested ""We were there with Cro-NNNGH!"" he paused as he was racked with headaches again. He could hear the screams of the citizens as the vile mist mercilessly poisoned their bodies with no hope for a cure, he felt the heat of the flames that were spreading everywhere.

The voice of the imp was in his ear, taunting him with his vile incantations

‚Äú*Eight, Sixty-Nine, Seven Hundred Seventy Four‚Ä¶*‚Äù

A firm arm hooked around his, he was lying on cold hard cobblestone. His ribs still aching as he fumbled his roll in order to avoid a fireball.

""*\[C'mon! Get up!* ***Get up!****\]*"" Crotad roared through his gas mask as he pulled up Aymon. The elf shook his head. The dark streets of Shihno was lit up with rampant fires and green poison mist suffused and reflected the light everywhere. The orc quickly picked him up and threw him into the wagon.

""*\[Hold on tight!\]*"" yelled the wagon driver. The two steeds reared up defiantly and shot across the streets of Shihno.

Gwen peeked out and quickly darted back in.

""*\[They've closed the ga-\]*"" she shrieked in panic as another explosion rocked the city. The wagon lurched and bumped along but continued to run, past the blown-up gates and taking them out of Shihno.

...

Philia halted the wagon some distance away, content that the darkness would shield them from view.

""What are we waiting for?"" Crotad asked. ""Shouldn't we head back to Elion-Nosc-""

Gwen yelled in fright as Philia shot the orc in the head.

""We need to make a message."" Philia said flatly. Together, she and the sorian driver dragged the orc's body onto the grass and took off all his gear. Philia reached into her bag and dropped a Velesian badge near the man.

""The patrols will be coming to this area soon. When they find Cory's body, Freid will knock on Veles' door with swords."" Philia explained, motioning for everyone to hop back into the wagon.

¬†

""W-why!?"" Aymon demanded, suddenly finding himself back atop the bluffs in Eastern Elion-Nosco. ""Why'd you kill Cro-I mean Cory?""

""Oh you do remember now, even his actual name."" Philia remarked, looking pretty impressed. ""He was a Velesian spy of course. He thought he could deceive us, well, you guys did, not me.""

""You don't know that!"" Aymon said. He tried to get up but his head was aching. ""Are... are you going to kill me too?""

""No."" Philia shrugged her shoulders. ""Unless you're a Velesian spy, last I checked, the only one you're spying on is me under Raldia's orders. Unless you have other masters you‚Äôre whispering secrets to‚Ä¶""

""I'm... I'm of Elion-Nosco!"" Aymon snapped. ""If we've already stopped Freid... then why are we here?""

""To launch the satellites."" Philia said.

""How are we here?"" Aymon asked, ""We should be in the capital while war is still going on!""

""King Raldia has yet to learn of our successful mission."" Philia told him. ""Also I needed to hunt down the last of his spies who were sent to assassinate me in case our mission failed. I manipulated you to use your magic to track them down. It's been about two days since we attacked Shihno.""

Aymon felt his stomach twist into a knot.

""What else..."" he began ""What else have you made me do?""

Philia furrowed her eyebrows. ""I'm only ten, Aymon! Not enough years for us to go on adventures worth a hundred episodes! MK Ultra takes time to work, and I just needed you to get those satellites up without you asking too many questions.""

There was an awkward pause, that can't be right. He could remember... things. Just like that memory where he... Something felt wrong. It should be something he could recall, he had just pulled it out of the shelves of his mind but now in his mind's eye his hand grasped nothing.

He tried to recall the recent thing they were talking about, the... what was it again? He and Philia were dancing in a ballroom of course! In Veles!

¬†

Philia looked at Gwen as Aymon stared blankly.

""What's going on, Miss Philia?"" the maid asked worriedly. ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt said anything besides asking you what else he has done.‚Äù

""Withdrawal symptoms."" The little girl said flatly, straightening up as she got some water boiling. ""His brain is all fried. Welp, time to put him out of his misery."" With that, Philia pulled her pistol and shot the elf clean between the eyes.

Gwen watched as the little girl coldly executed someone she had known for years. Her stomach turned, she had to look away.

""Fortunately, since we just did something extremely difficult and foolhardy, Aymon's death won't be met with suspicion. As a matter of fact..."" Philia laughed, twirling the pistol with her index finger ""...let's just say old pointy-ears used himself as a shield to protect me, sounds like a good idea, what do you think Gwen?""

The maid nervously nodded, her hands shaking. ""M-maybe we shouldn't do this Emm-Kay Ultra anymore... i-it sounds like it's too dangerous.""

""Yup."" Philia said, effortlessly holstering her pistol without looking, ""I can't remember how many times I have to remind myself to say the magic words to help stir his mind back on track. I need something easier and less random, I mean..."" the girl wiggled her arms around to indicate a jumble, ""...what was I thinking using '**Scroll of Temblor**' as his magic word? I mean if people overhear it, it just begs to be asked all sorts of awkward questions. I need something easier to work with, you know? Something you can say casually and people will just outright dismiss it.""

""Are you...going to kill me one day too? Miss Philia?"" the maid sniffled.

Philia quickly padded over and gave her maid a hug.

""I'll protect you.""

\_\_\_

**The Present Day:**

""Okay so if I understand correctly..."" Zefir paused ""...Philia drugged and did some MK Ultra on this guy Aymon, and because he's such a good wizard, she decided to use him to launch some satellites.""

""Precisely."" Gwen nodded ""We were at war with Freid at the time, so Philia took the opportunity to stop the invasion by pinning the blame on Veles. ‚Äú

Gwen paused to help herself to her cup of coffee ‚ÄúThe idea was that Veles was using this incoming invasion to steal back some disputed artifacts. Freid held them and according to their history, it was gifted to them, not Veles, who incidentally believes it to be the other way around.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo in other words, they would buy Elion-Nosco‚Äôs excuse that they had nothing to do with that attack, and Veles had a motive and opportunity to strike unexpectedly.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly, Miss Philia wasn‚Äôt given an army to march down to the border with Freid. So the Freidians had no reason to blame the Elion-Noscoites since there wasn‚Äôt an army camping outside of their country. It was just a small group. Aymon was trained in firearms and tactics of your world through the MK Ultra program, as well as to forget them when needed. I'm not sure of exactly how it worked but to put it succinctly, Aymon was becoming more and more unstable, in the end, even if she spared his life then, he would have just simply snapped one day.""

""Still..."" Zefir remarked, scowling ""To think that just four of you managed to sneak into a city and gun everyone down. Why the dramatics? Why not just detonate the bombs from a distance? According to the story, all one needed to pin the blame on this country was to leave Cory with a Velesian badge.""

Gwen's eyes widened as if a lightbulb went off in her head. ""Oh right, I only gave you the plausible memory that Aymond had. You see...""

\_\_\_\_

**Shihno City, Freid, Several Years Ago:**

""You with me still, Pointy-Ears?"" Philia asked, lightly pushing Aymond who was having an episode of his mind blanking out.

""Y-yes your grace!"" The elf said, steadying himself against one of the pole racks that stood in this vast cloakroom, like army of attentive valets.

Philia smiled, patting his hand reassuringly. ""Don't worry about it, we will find that Scroll of Temblor before morning.""

""Heh, about time we do."" Cory said, stuffing the Velesian relics in his bag. ""You sure you want me to hold on to this?""

Philia held up her hands and shrugged her shoulders. ""Unless we have someone who can item box, you're the only one who can carry it.""

""They're waking up, King Fish!"" Gwen said, pointing her gun at the stirring butlers.

""Maid One, no."" Philia said, pulling a knife from belt. ""Guns are too loud. Help us out, Allen."" she added, referring to Cory's codename during this operation.

""With pleasure, boss. Pointy-Ears, watch the door."" Cory said, drawing his knife.

As the butlers lay bleeding out, the squad quickly changed into their black hazmat suits. There was a collective chuckle as Gwen remarked everyone now looked like ant-eaters. Philia took from one bag a huge amount of thermite, rigged to a bomb that would explode in a few minutes.

""Once I press this switch, it's time to strike."" Philia warned. ""Check weapons.""

Quickly and efficiently the three of them checked their guns were in working order.

""Let's go then."" Philia said, activating the timer for the bomb.

The four of them swiftly moved along the dimly-lit corridors of the mansion, the muffled sounds from the party concealed their footsteps on the plush carpet, blending seamlessly with the typical cacophony of a large assembly.

Gwen pressed her ear to the double doors that led to the ballroom.

""Are you sure we have to shoot our way out of here, King Fish?"" Gwen asked. ""Won't it be much better if we just let the bomb and nerve gas do the killing?""

""No, they need to see us."" Philia said, tightening her gas mask. ""Otherwise, this will be mistaken for a cone hat party trick gone wrong. This is \[Terrorism\], it needs a face.""

""Terrorism?"" The rest echoed, parroting as best as they can the word Philia said in English.

Philia walked to the door, ignoring their confusion, she checked that a round was in the chamber of her gun.

""Ready?"" Cory said excitedly.

‚ÄúReady.‚Äù Gwen exclaimed quietly.

‚ÄúReady.‚Äù Aymon nodded.

""S'nami Bog..."" Philia said cryptically, turning to her team. ""\[Remember, No Noscoan‚Ä¶\]""

Cory kicked the doors open, and together they opened fire on the unsuspecting guests.

‚Ä¶

""What are we waiting for?"" Cory asked. ""Shouldn't we head back to Elion-No-""

Gwen yelled in fright as Philia shot the orc. Arcs of lightning from her gun caused him to seize up and collapse to the ground.

""We need to make a message."" Philia said flatly, reeling in the taser. Together, she and the sorian driver dragged the orc onto the grass.

‚ÄúAlmost a shame we can‚Äôt take those relics, boss.‚Äù The Sorian driver said as they laid the orc on the ground.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre worth more in enemy hands than ours.‚Äù Philia explained as they removed all the modern equipment off of Cory. ‚ÄúTo this day there would be many nobles in Veles who would pay good money to have those returned to their country.‚Äù

The sorian grinned, his chuckle like an alligator‚Äôs bellow as his scales flashed the color of amusement. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite a lot of people to implicate.‚Äù

‚ÄúA lot‚Ä¶‚Äù Philia replied. She pulled the knapsack that contained the relics, opened it slightly so they were visible, then clenched the orc‚Äôs fingers around the pack straps. The orc‚Äôs fingers flexed lightly in response.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Philia lied, quickly taking out smelling salts and waving them over Cory‚Äôs nose. ‚ÄúHe was Velesian, and he thought he could deceive us, now, Freid will knock on Veles‚Äô door, with swords.‚Äù

As they finished throwing in the last of Cory‚Äôs equipment, Philia noticed that Aymond had gone pale again.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with the elf?‚Äù The driver asked.

Philia quickly jumped back inside. ‚ÄúI think some of the poison gas got to him,‚Äùshe lied. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll make it.‚Äù

\_\_\_

**Autumnhollow, Present Day:**

Zefir sat back on his chair, the Whales were still napping quietly.

""It's a little hard to believe we've got Philia working with people from kingdoms her family was at war with.""

""It's too late to worry about that now..."" Gwen sighed ""She's announced her identity ever since we joined Ingrid. Kinu and Kvaris don't bear any enmity with her because Amaduscia by that time had long retired, also, Freid's conflict with Elion-Nosco was diverted towards Veles which to this day is widely believed to have been done by overzealous actors.""

""Third parties, got it."" Zefir said.

""As you say."" Gwen continued ""If it's of any relief, that act of Miss Philia's saved more lives because Veles was willing to deal and make compromises, and thus smooth out misunderstandings. By that time, sufficient forces had built up on the border that coming into a full-blown conflict was deemed ill-advised. An armistice was signed and since then, Elion-Nosco has been mired with the same territories with no new conquests for years.""

Zefir sighed ""I hope the Enthana girls don't think too badly of her.""

Gwen's expression was troubled as well ""I hope so too as well.""

**Elion-Nosco Palace, Several Years Ago, Days after:**

Gwen waited nervously outside the council chamber as Philia gave her debriefing to the King and his ministers. As she sat on a divan and looked out the window, she could hear past the chirping of birds bits and pieces of Philia‚Äôs report.

‚ÄúYes, Shihno‚Äôs burned to the ground. My mercenaries took care of that, the war with Freid and the opportunity to sneak in and take their holy relics was an opportunity they could not afford to miss‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, yes. Aymon and Cory were Velesian spies all along, fortunately Freid did us a favor by eliminating them, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about angering Veles, since we didn‚Äôt execute them ourselves. I believe the Velesian throne will be satisfied using their deaths as a pretext for further conflict with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe invasion‚Äôs finished, we don‚Äôt need to send as many people to the southern border since Freid will be busy focusing on their other neighbor.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you could say that Veles is now relying on us to keep Freid restricted to just posturing and making threats. They can‚Äôt fight two enemies at once. Now, Veles will owe us a favor.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Lord Father, of course, I‚Äôll keep the maesters informed.‚Äù

\_\_\_

**Velesian Palace, a few hours later:**

The King of Veles sighed and stretched after finishing the day‚Äôs work at his desk. Letters were signed and agreements sealed. Replies were made, people bowed and scraped as they were introduced to his room to favors and petitions while ministers came to give news both good and bad, and sometimes causing the king to call over an aide to take back something he had written.

Today was a less frantic day, and he was looking forward to a few days of putting his royal status to good use by enjoying himself in the countryside. One more letter came up for the king to read, and this was delivered to him personally by the Prime Minister himself.

The King sighed but decided to take a few minutes to read, it was rather short, only one page. The Prime Minister was quiet as he handed the letter over, letting him know that whatever questions that would arise after reading were either too obvious or had no answers forthcoming.

¬†

*Cory‚Äôs accomplished his mission, the Sigil of the Dove and Icon of Saint Erythren should be on their way back to Velesian soil.*

*With these holy relics restored, the Order of The Holy Fire and the Wings of Light will see a revival in Veles, these churches will now owe your kingdom debt they can never repay.*

*The ones that have been restored to Freid are fake, there will be quite an uproar in the days to come once the spell wears off.*

*That said, these two are only half of the relics that once graced Veles. The other half are probably still somewhere in Freid.*

*Shihno has been severely devastated, the severity of the attack, the ineffectual attempt to halt it, and the attribution to Veles means we will minimize deaths because not only out of fear of the power of the attack, but they know your kingdom always has an ear for Reason.*

*It‚Äôll be difficult, but I‚Äôm sure you can convince them that your throne had nothing to do with this attack, and was probably motivated by miscreants here in Elion-Nosco.*

*Incidentally, I‚Äôve also taken the liberty of pilfering from Shihno something interesting, it‚Äôs a revolutionary advancement that I think all kingdoms regardless of outlook would benefit from. We have ‚ÄúPointy-Ears‚Äù to thank for that, he helped uncover the secret to Freid‚Äôs once-exclusive magic.*

*As for me, Elion-Nosco thinks I had Velesian-speaking mercenaries carry out the assault, financed by a few hard-liners in your kingdom.*

*They still haven‚Äôt figured out that I‚Äôve been undermining their attempts to gain new territories.*

*The Elion-Nosco war with Freid will bogged down soon, and the war-hawks promoting this idea will be finished. It also seems those in power are promoting me to a higher position. I expect in the coming years we‚Äôll have better opportunities working together to keep the peace.*

*The enemy of your enemy,*

*King Fish*

1hk4ggi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NMMNG/comments/1hk4ggi/nmmng_in_philly/,NMMNG in Philly,"Hello fellow Philadelphians, 

First of all , I have to ask , if there is any change a ""physical"" group exists in philly. As i understand and as expected its hard to maintain an in-person group , but still worth to check. 

Then if not , I wanted to ask , if there is any interest from at least a couple people to meet up and create a safe place and try to scale it to make a group. You see guys , I ve been in this city and country for a little less than 2 years. Now , I m still trying to figure out if me being a Nice Guy is the reason i havent been able to make any real friends but damn i dont feel like i have any one with whom i feel safe. 

Maybe its too soon , i do see some progress on me being  more comfortable expressing my feelings , so maybe eventually i will be able to open up to my friends from home. I read the book a few months ago and didnt do anything about it , but now its my 2nd time , i m taking it seriously and i m finally understanding what it says. 

If anyone is interested let‚Äôs grab a cup of coffee and see how we can help each other , after all thats what Dr. Robert ""preaches"".",1,1734892168.0,NMMNG,0,1.0,False

So long story short I can get matches on tinder and women will ask to hook up with them or even just to meet up for coffee etc. I however have insane social anxiety (womp,womp). 
This women I matched with on tinder has been asking me  to hook up with her and I will always respond with and excuse. I just know I'm trash at sex and I'm too socially inept to take that first leap to get better. I don't even remember the last time I had a conversation with a women that wasn't over text. My life is amazing except for this one area where I can't seem to conquer my anxiety.

1hk4fsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TapTitans2/comments/1hk4fsf/clan_recruitment_y5k7y/,[Clan Recruitment - y5k7y],"**üì¢ Join the Hay Happers (Rank 17)! An Alpha Legion Clan!**  
**Clan Code:** y5k7y
**Our Average Damage:** 170M, *Top 25 hitters:* **220M**
**Open Slots:** At least 1
**Discord Contacts:** Gondulf (h2\_myself), hordan9643, ayrisvashu

**Who We Are:**

Welcome to **Hay Happers**, where the sun always shines, the Titans always fall, and the laughs are as common as the kills. We‚Äôre a top-tier clan in Tap Titans 2, perpetually hanging out in the Master Tier, **ranked between 11th and 13th, and our clan's average damage is 170M per hit.** like clockwork (we're consistent, okay?). Will you be the member that pushes us into the glorious top 10? We are part of the prestigious [**Alpha Legion**](https://discord.gg/tt2) alliance, where competition is fierce, but camaraderie is fiercer. üåü

Our clan is built on the principles of teamwork, fun, and a relentless pursuit of improvement. We're so data-driven, our raid bot makes Siri look like a pocket calculator. üìä Speaking of raids, **our top 25 hitters average a whopping 210M damage per hit.** Not too shabby, eh? Our bot is so good at its job, it might as well be sentient (don‚Äôt worry, it only uses its powers for good). The bot tracks everything you do during raids, from what cards you roll to how much damage you dealt before you even know it yourself. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant, minus the coffee runs.

**What We‚Äôre Looking For:**

We‚Äôre currently on the hunt for some fresh blood‚Äîerr, *dedicated players*‚Äîto join our ranks. Here‚Äôs the deal:

* **Raid Level:** 800+ (1000+ preferred)
* **Total Card Levels:** 1250+ (1400+ preferred)
* **Necrobear Level:** 100+ preferred
* **Damage Expectations:** Consistent 6/6 hits per cycle (excluding Kill Cycle) and collection of all 6 daily morale.
* **Consistency:** We like our attacks like we like our coffee‚Äîstrong, consistent, and absolutely necessary.

If you‚Äôve got what it takes to hit the damage numbers we‚Äôre pulling (our top 15 hitters average 250m per hit, btw), you‚Äôll fit right in. But don‚Äôt worry‚Äîif you‚Äôre still working your way up, we‚Äôre more than willing to help you get there as long as you‚Äôre putting in the effort.

**Why You‚Äôll Love Us:**

* **Friendly Vibes:** We might be competitive, but we‚Äôre also friendly and understanding. But here's the real tea: we're all about that work-life-Tap Titans balance. Miss an attack? We won't send you to the titan timeout corner. Forget to collect morale? We'll only judge you a little (kidding!). üòâ Just don‚Äôt make it a habit, and we‚Äôll get along fine.
* **Expert Knowledge:** Between our seasoned veterans and our all-seeing bot, you‚Äôll have access to an ocean of knowledge that‚Äôll help you optimize your gameplay.
* **Community:** Being part of Alpha Legion means you‚Äôll get to hang out with some of the best TT2 players around. We‚Äôve got a shared Discord, where we swap stories, strategies, and the occasional meme.
* **Data-Driven Raiding:** With our bot at the helm, our raids are efficient, strategic, and a little bit terrifying in their precision. We call out attacks on Discord, but don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit‚Äôs not the military. You only have to call hits that might cause overkill.

Here's a sneak peak at the fancy bot

*Processing img 58dy2i30poid1...*

**How to Join:**

Interested? We thought so. üßê To apply, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/tt2. Post screenshots of your player stats, raid stats, and recent raid damage in the ‚Å†applications channel, and ping Gondulf (h2\_myself) to get started.

We‚Äôre excited to see what you‚Äôve got. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned vet or an up-and-coming Titan slayer, Hay Happers is where you‚Äôll find your new home. See you on the battlefield! üó°Ô∏è Blow the dust off this ancient tome and read more about our clan culture [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/HH-myself/comments/tqcbbd/mytt2clan_y5k7y_hi_we_are_hay_happers/)!

**TL;DR:**  
Join Hay Happers, a top-tier Alpha Legion clan, for epic raids, friendly vibes, and a bot that‚Äôs smarter than all of us. We‚Äôre looking for players with Raid Level 800+, Total Card Levels 1300+, and Necrobear Level 100+. If you‚Äôre down for some serious Titan slaying, hop into our Discord and let‚Äôs chat!",4,1734892115.0,TapTitans2,5,0.84,False

So I'm not sure what to think about this but it's been bugging me since I woke up. Yesterday I made a post on the bird app saying that I had several fics queued up to post over the holidays and an update for a longer fix I've been posting too. I mentioned if anyone wanted to be notified when they go up to subscribe to my profiles on AO3 and linked them (one is for smut and the other is gen fic). 

Today I woke up to a couple comments from my moots I've interacted with before (so I know it's not bots) saying they liked the two new fics and read them this morning. Then they said they couldn't wait for an update on the other fic...

Only I haven't posted anything new just yet üòï 

I've also had this happen before where someone commented that they read a fic almost immediately after I posted it, like I'm talking less than 5 min after I updated with a 5000 word chapter that had some serious exposition to chew on. Left a comment like ""omg I loved this"" but it would be impossible unless they're reading 1000 words a min (and actually understanding it too)

After today, I'm starting to wonder if these people are actually reading my work or what the angle is here. 

I also noticed no one ever comments on specific stuff in my fic anymore either, it's just a bunch of ""that was good!"" ""Great stuff"" etc whereas before, I used to get super in depth comments on my fics with favorite parts and quotes pulled so I know the reader actually enjoyed what I wrote (which is so gratifying to receive as a writer!)

Has anyone experienced this before? It's making me doubt if I have readers at all tbh or if I'm just a content farm for them. Maybe I'm just overthinking before I've finished my coffee?

* Big and simple kettle that only brings water to a boil. No temp controls.
* Descaled and cleaned

Both brewers have been used and cleaned as thoroughly as I can manage. I soaked them in a baking soda bath and then scrubbed them with hot soapy water. Smaller pieces, like the silicone parts and the Espro P3 basket filters, have also gone through my ultrasonic cleaner. Please be aware that some of the silicone pieces are slightly stained from coffee. I tried my best to remove as much of the stains as possible without damaging the parts.

Shipping is **NOT** included with the price. I use Pirate Ship to find the lowest price I can, so if you would like to find out the cost of shipping before buying just let me know and I'll get that figured out. If you would like any extra shipping insurance, please let me know and I can add that on. Purchasing multiple items will be shipped together and likely reduce cost of shipping.

1hk4bea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmaWaterwaysCruises/comments/1hk4bea/romantic_danube/,Romantic Danube,"I just returned from AmaWaterways' Romantic Danube cruise, and I‚Äôm still buzzing with excitement! This 7-night journey took us from Budapest to Vilshofen, and it was truly a dream come true. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my experience:

Itinerary Highlights
Budapest, Hungary: The cruise started with an evening sail through Budapest. Seeing the Parliament building and Chain Bridge lit up was magical. We also did a city tour, stopping at Buda Castle and Fisherman‚Äôs Bastion.
Bratislava, Slovakia: I joined the walking tour through the charming Old Town, and we even had time for coffee at a local caf√©.
Vienna, Austria: Vienna is a highlight on any Danube cruise. AmaWaterways organized a fantastic city tour, including St. Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral and a special concert at a Viennese palace.
Wachau Valley, Austria: We sailed through the Wachau Valley, and the scenery was breathtaking‚Äîvineyards, castles, and quaint villages. The stop in D√ºrnstein included a hike up to the castle ruins where Richard the Lionheart was once held.
Passau, Germany: This picturesque town is where the Danube, Inn, and Ilz rivers meet. I joined the guided walking tour, but some guests opted for a bike ride along the river.
Onboard Experience
The AmaLea was stunning! The ship‚Äôs design was modern yet cozy, with plenty of spots to relax and take in the views. Highlights onboard included:

Dining: Every meal was exceptional. The highlight for me was the Chef‚Äôs Table, where they prepared a multi-course meal paired with local wines.
Activities: Yoga classes, a wine-tasting session, and live music performances in the lounge made the journey even more enjoyable.
Service: The crew was incredible‚Äîalways attentive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile.
Excursions
AmaWaterways offers excursions for every activity level. I loved the variety‚Äîwalking tours, bike rides, and even wine tastings in the Wachau Valley. The local guides were passionate and made each destination come alive with their stories.

Who Should Go?
This cruise is perfect for anyone looking for a mix of relaxation, culture, and history. Whether you‚Äôre a foodie, a history buff, or someone who just loves scenic travel, the Danube has something for everyone.

I asked husband (possibly around 5 times) if it was OK to serve her there (he had been on night duty) and showed him the sippy cup. He kept saying yes, so I served my daughter all of the milk left. When I approach them to hand her over her sippy cup, he looks at me wided-eyed and says: you can't give her that, the milk in there has been out for a while. Yes, I did get angry because there was no milk left and I told him I literally asked you about 5 times. He kept on throwing the blame back at me, saying: you didn't show me the cup, I saw you take another cup, which is all BS of course. In the end I got quite angry because he could not accept it was his fault and this could have all been avoided if he had simply gotten off the couch and actually looked at what I was showing him. He said I was crazy for getting so angry over some milk. Our daughter of course started crying because she got no milk. 

Our kid got stressed from our arguing and started misbehaving. She climbed on the table, and then ran to the room to jump on the bed. As I was taking her off, she kept on trying to jump back so at a point I raised my voice telling her no. My husband came running in to ""rescue"" her, said that he could already see I was going to have ""one of my days"" and that he would go out all day with his daughter and leave me alone as they shouldn't have to deal with that. This pissed me off so much for many reasons. I am not a mentally unstable person who is sometimes constantly pissed off simply because. I also found it incredibly hypocritical from his part to make that comment when he is much harsher with our daughter than I am (I do call him out when I believe he is crossing a line, respectfully and never undermining his parenting or making him feel crazy). I told him this which just led to more arguing. He stood by what he said, which only hurt more. 

At this point, I am starting to question many things. I am the breadwinner, and I am thinking that he is still with me only because he depends financially on me. If just from this argument he literally wanted to take his daughter and run away, I think he would totally leave if he had the financial means. We had also just agreed on trying for a second kid, and I am now questioning everything since I am not even sure why is he with me if he thinks I am this crazy person who has ""days"". I am 41 so I do not have much time to try, but am wondering if this is the right decision, or if maybe we should consider a separation. Thank you for any advice you can provide.

It‚Äôs been one month and a half since my boyfriend(M39) and I(F27) have broken up. We were together for 2 years, living in the same apartment and working for our own business in consulting. 
The main reasons we broke up were:
For me: in the beginning of our relationship he kept meeting and talking  with other women (no sex, but going out for coffees and flirting with them). Then once we moved in together and ended long distance, he didn‚Äôt talk or meet with anyone but I started to realise that his ex, whom he remained friends with, was extremely present in his life, they would talk daily, they would still use the nicknames since they were together, she would try to hold his hand, hug him tightly and touch his face and hair. They have broken up 4 years ago but continued this blurred lines. I was extremely uncomfortable and I had multiple discussions with both of them about how this is not ok for me and it‚Äôs a lack of respect. He never really got my point and tried each and every time to change my way of thinking about their relationship. And from this point onwards, we started having a lot of fights about this, reaching a point where we took a 2 weeks break when I was going away for a work trip. We decided and promised not to meet or talk with anyone during this time and focus on resting and making our relationship work once I come back. He met with 3 women during this break. 
For him: he told me the reason he wants to break up is because he got very tired to be with someone who is second guessing his intentions and who doesn‚Äôt trust him. He only admitted he met with all these women on the same day I decided to go into no contact with him. He also doesn‚Äôt want to accept my point that his relationship with his ex is lacking boundaries and said that his ex is non-negotiable. 

Rationally, I know that I should just move on with my life and heal from all this, but emotionally I really wish and hope he will change and maybe become more mature. Is it possible for men his age to realise these things and change?

*P.S. all the women he would always flirt and talk with were young women, from 20-25 years old. ",1,1734891376.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1hk46lf,https://i.redd.it/ctbklmzryf8e1.jpeg,Kimpton Grand Roatan Review,"Hi Everyone!

Here‚Äôs a quick review of our recent stay at the Kimpton Roatan! I‚Äôve broken it down into point form for simplicity:
	‚Ä¢	Our stay: We spent 6 days in total as Diamond Elite members, using 255,000 points. We booked a 5-night stay and a 1-night stay to maximize our confirmable suite upgrades, and they allowed us to apply one upgrade for the entire stay.
	‚Ä¢	The room: We stayed in the Grand Roatan Ocean View Suite, which was absolutely stunning! It was perfect for us. We had to request a coffee machine (it‚Äôs one of the items you might need to ask for), and the room was cleaned twice daily‚Äîfantastic service!
	‚Ä¢	The gym: As runners, we loved using their gym every morning‚Äîit‚Äôs a beautiful space! The only downside was the air conditioning, which wasn‚Äôt very effective.
	‚Ä¢	Laundry: Hotel laundry service was pricey (around $300), so we opted for a local service called Beach Laundry, which only charged $10 USD for a significant amount of laundry.
	‚Ä¢	Breakfast: We chose the complimentary daily breakfast benefit as Diamond Elites, and it was excellent‚Äîdefinitely worth it!
	‚Ä¢	Groceries and snacks: There‚Äôs a small grocery store about a 10-minute walk up the beach where we grabbed snacks and affordable alcohol.
	‚Ä¢	Water taxis and snorkeling: Taking the water taxi from the beach to West Bay might feel a bit sketchy at first, but it‚Äôs very safe. Don‚Äôt miss Sundowners for rum cake! If you‚Äôre into snorkeling, bring your own gear (we picked some up in West Bay) to explore the incredible reef right off the hotel‚Äôs coast.
	‚Ä¢	Island tours: We booked a local tour with Steve Hutton, a resident of Roatan for 25 years. He was fantastic and gave us a very authentic, personal experience. We visited the mangroves, a hidden bar on stilts over the ocean (called Rick‚Äôs, complete with a pet monkey), and even a local brewery. Highly recommend him‚ÄîPM me for his contact or check out Steve‚Äôs Paddle Shack.
	‚Ä¢	Getting around: It can be tricky to get out of West Bay/West End, so having a reliable local guide like Steve is invaluable.
	‚Ä¢	Airport transport: We used Kimpton‚Äôs pickup/drop-off service, which costs $55 USD each way per room.
	‚Ä¢	Weather: It rained a little each day, but it was always warm and sunny overall‚Äîno complaints!
	‚Ä¢	Comparison to SeaFire: While we loved Kimpton SeaFire, the two properties are very different. Roatan offers an authentic jungle experience in a developing region, whereas Grand Cayman has a completely different vibe. It really depends on what you‚Äôre looking for.

That‚Äôs it for now‚Äîfeel free to ask me any questions! I‚Äôll do my best to help!

** I  almost forgot! The cocktail hour from 5-6 PM every day was fantastic. We met some amazing people there, and a group of us even ended up doing the Chef‚Äôs Table together‚Äîit was absolutely incredible!

I also applied $580 USD worth of meal/drink vouchers to our checkout. I couldn‚Äôt process them through the app, but the front desk added them for me, which was super helpful.

We had a spa day, and the facility was stunning‚Äîcomplete with plunge pools, snacks, teas, steam rooms, etc. You could easily spend an entire day there! However, I had one negative experience. I‚Äôm not big on massages but wanted to use the steam rooms and plunge pools. A day pass costs $155 USD, and the spa front desk clerk mentioned that for $165 USD, I could get a massage and the day pass, so I went with that option. My wife and I both checked in, enjoyed the facilities, and had our massages. But when we checked out, we were charged $225 USD each because we had couples massage (in the same room) instead of individual massages in individual rooms (LOL???). I found this really misleading and was quite upset‚Äîit was the only negative experience of our entire trip.

Lastly, mosquitoes weren‚Äôt too bad if you wore repellent. The only time I got bitten was on a day I didn‚Äôt use much. Don‚Äôt forget to bring your own repellent and sunscreen, as both are incredibly expensive there. Unlike Kimpton SeaFire, sunscreen isn‚Äôt readily available around the pool.",6,1734891375.0,ihghotelsresorts,0,1.0,False

Hang in there!","I've been lurking for many months.  I just wanted y'all to know that I feel your pain.  I was prescribed Olanzapine at 20mg for my first and only manic episode.  My ward shrinker wanted me to ensure I could pay for the prescription, basically for life, as a condition of getting sprung from the grippy sock gulag.

My new head shrinker man was nice enough to show me videos of TD.  Until then I never honestly looked into side effects.  I was so traumatized from the mania and hospitalization that all I wanted was to never have to go through that again.

Funny thing was, I knew days into mania that something was up.  I wasn't sleeping more than 3 hours a night and still had tons of energy.  Even though I had just quit cannabis and started a Keto diet, I knew something was wrong.  My family insisted they didn't think I was manic.  My Mom is BP1, so it's not like we didn't know anything about it.

My shrinker, who I had seen once before via Zoom for ""uncontrollable rage"" and suicide ideation, was too busy to see me when I went back to the clinic.  I was referred to local walk-in clinics or Emerg.  I talked to my walk-in GP, who didn't want to see me in person, and complained of ""hypomania and insomnia"", the same things I put on my Psych intake form.  He prescribed 25mg of Seroquel.  Supposedly I was to follow-up with my shrink.

Well, as many of you likely know, 25mg of Seroquel ain't taking anyone out of mania.  Two ""wellness checks"" with the RCMP, and I end up going to the hospital.  Because the officer says ""she's going that way anyway"".  It saved me the walk.  Which, trust me, I had the energy for.

She asks me while parked at the back of the hospital if I consent with something to do with Section 14 of the Mental Health Act.  At this point, I'm done fighting, I'm done with walking miles a day and hanging out with buskers and homeless people.  I knew better, but I said ""yes"".

So, I basically committed myself.  They were too busy to see me, but I ""had to be hospitalized"".  Hello, Bipolar I diagnosis.  Did I have to be hospitalized, or did they need to see me in a timely fashion, in person, and prescribe me the medication I needed to come out of mania?

Being lied to to get me to admit myself added insult to injury.  They'll only see you if they can incarcerate you.

So it was one week in the HOA.  I was given Booty Juice and put in isolation at one point for the crime of singing O' Canada in the shower.  They wouldn't allow me to calm down and sit by myself.  It was ""lay down on your stomach"" while they pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in each cheek.  Quality, compassionate care.

Then one week in the normal ward.  Day passes.  Eventually allowed to leave the place.  Gee, thanks for everything.

I was on Olanzapine for around 8 months.  I tapered down to 5 mg over a couple months.  It sucked.  Then to 2.5 over a month.  That was rough.  Anxiety out of nowhere, anhedonia, panic attacks, loss of confidence.

This is after the months of anhedonia, sexual side effects, general blankness and disinterest when on that poison.

I took multiple weeks off work, first as sick days, then on short term disability, to deal with it all.

I had to get a gradual return to work plan.  A full week at work was overwhelming.  I started at 2 days for 2 weeks and worked up from there, one day at a time.

I got Gabapentin to kind of help as a cross-taper for anxiety and insomnia.  It didn't really work for anxiety for me that well, but it helped a bit for sleep.  Sleep is King.  I take it every week or two if I feel like I need an especially good sleep due to work conditions.  I seem to get a bit of an emotional boost they day after taking it.  I'm able to work long hours without tiring or becoming grumpy.  But it's not so enjoyable that it feels addicting, to me.

For months this has been my morning routine:  Wake up around the same time everyday.  If I wake up too early, I go back to bed, and basically meditate.  Just try to breathe relatively deeply, especially on the exhale, and pay attention to the process.  I made. deal with myself, I may be a partial insomniac, but I'm going to become a freaking Zen master with all the meditation I get in.  It's been a huge help.

After I wake up, I say the Lord's Prayer.  Make my bed.  Drink coffee under a HappyLight Duo SAD lamp while I read Marcus Aurelius ""Meditations"" with my sweet kitty on my lap.  Then I go for a quick walk up a steep nearby hill, if I have time.  Have a shower, full cold at the end, but only if I feel like I'm tired or I need it.  Get dressed and off to work.

I'm not sure if any of you appreciate all that, but I was getting to this main point.  I'M BASICALLY BACK AT BASELINE.  If not better.  I feel healthy.  I get goosebumps.  My sex drive is back.  I'm no longer anxious.  I have a role in my little community.  I follow Stoic principles.  I reach out to my family and friends often.  I feel like my life has value.  I'm here to help others.  Like we all are.

At the end of the day, ""We're all just walking each other home.""

Hang in there.

Your suffering has created a depth to your character that you may not recognize yet.  You are stronger than you know.  Your pain has meaning.  YOU ARE NOT FORSAKEN.

You are not alone.  God loves you.  I love you.  Strangers love you.

An important spiritual symbol is the dot within the circle.  You are the dot.  You seem small from a distance.  But you are your own universe.  The circle is God.  You are always with God.  You are safe.  Find your center.  Listen to your inner voice.  Follow God.

TLDR:  AP's suck.  Time heals.  I've been through a type of hell, and came out the other side.

Follow me.  Hope is a direction.  Look towards the light.  And start walking.  One foot in front of the other.  Time is meaningless.  Direction is everything.

 My girlfriend loves coffee. Especially iced coffee. We went to Dunkin Donuts a lot. Probably too much at times. She would do mobile orders for us. I got so used to going up to the drive-thru and saying mobile order for Christine. That sticks with me now when I go to Dunkin. I love the drink and food I may be getting there but I also feel sad. 

She became comfortable farting in front of me. I know that‚Äôs a big thing for women. Some couples have been together for years and they don‚Äôt fart each other. She did it once in my car by accident and got embarrassed. I laughed. It was funny and cute. It didn‚Äôt bother me or annoy me at all. It never did when she did. I would ask if she had to fart because I would love when she did. It was a thing we had. I‚Äôve never been a guy bothered by a woman farting. 

She also let me sit on her lap a few times when she was on the toilet. I know that may sound weird. It was like a sexy and kinky thing we did. I would kiss her. That‚Äôs obviously a very vulnerable place for anyone. But we didn‚Äôt make each other feel weird. I‚Äôve never done that with any other woman ever. I‚Äôve never felt that comfortable with another woman like that. We were going the bathroom in front of each other and it became normal. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd lose that. 

We also started writing sexy stories for each other. Something I‚Äôve never done with another girl. Stories with us in them in various situations doing different things. I love writing, so I loved doing it. A lot of fantasy went into it. She loved what I wrote. And what she would write was really hot. I don‚Äôt know how many women will do this and enjoy writing. That‚Äôs not something easy to find.

Her and I had so many inside jokes that we would always laugh about. We had nicknames for each other. Even sweetheart has stuck with me. Other girls I‚Äôve been with haven‚Äôt called me that. Her and I would call each other that. It meant a lot to me.
