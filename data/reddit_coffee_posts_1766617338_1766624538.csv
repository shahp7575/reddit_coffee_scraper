1pv1rbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1pv1rbq/seeking_advice_on_pursuing_a_woman_intentionally/,Seeking advice on pursuing a woman intentionally and respectfully as an Orthodox Christian,"Hello everyone,

I’m looking for some guidance from an Orthodox Christian perspective.

I recently met a woman through mutual friends at a graduation gathering. We had a really good, thoughtful conversation about faith, church history, and our shared cultural background. Since then, we’ve exchanged a few respectful messages, and everything has been calm, friendly, and faith-centered. She is Orthodox (and so am I), and I’m trying to approach this with seriousness and restraint, not casually.

My intention is not to rush or to treat this like modern dating culture, but rather to discern properly and respectfully. I would like to ask her out for coffee simply to get to know her better, but I want to do this in a way that is appropriate, clear, and not overwhelming.

My questions are:

* How does one properly pursue a woman in an Orthodox Christian way without rushing or being passive?
* At what point is it appropriate to express interest beyond friendship, while still honoring discernment?
* How do you balance clarity of intention with patience and sobriety?

I want to move forward with integrity, respect her boundaries, and keep Christ at the center of this process. Any advice from those with experience or spiritual insight would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",1,1766624355.0,OrthodoxChristianity,1,1.0,False

2. Area rug is 8x10 to give you some size reference of the room. I will be getting a new, brighter one.
3. 100% thinking a light-med tan paint for the walls to brighten it up.

5. TV stand is going. It's too tall so I'll get a lower one. Maybe a lighter wood one? Getting a 75"" TV which is what is there currently.
6. What kind of chair should I get with the couch? I was thinking a Wall Hugger recliner, but I don't want it to be too big. Plus I wouldn't have any room for a coffee table with a recliner kicked out.
7. Corner bookshelf is going, and I may just have a side table and/or fake plant where it is.

1pv1p3u,https://i.redd.it/pcwljywk099g1.jpeg,BBANGYA order problems,"Hey, for some context I’m a baby STAY (started to be a stay in July) who has so far bought the physical album for KARMA.

So I preordered DO IT it ver in around October with BBANGYA, a small business based in England.

The thing is, when my package came on Saturday I opened it and was so confused until I realised it was definitely the PLVE version, I checked my order and confirmed that I ordered the right one and that the right amount of money was taken out of my account.

I was/am devastated (I’m a teen so £27 is a lot of money) and I didn’t even get the proper version. The PLVE version has so much less than the IT ver.

So I immediately emailed the BBANGYA email address I found on their website with evidence (a pic of my order and order number, the actual stuff I got and the bank statement) but I haven’t got a reply yet and it’s been about a week.

I’m wondering what to do, should I chase them? Or just wait because I’m really hoping they can exchange it for the right version cause I really want it and don’t have the money to buy another album (no pocket money left :<.   )

I’ve attached everything I got in the package 

Thanks for your help!

It is i, the Speranza ninja. We had a group of 6 people, going around activating the antennas on hidden bunker.

Once we were making our way to the bunker, i mentioned to you, that i had no ammo, no heals, no items, that my inventory was fully empty. I placed my trust in you, as i had before, and as i was planning to do in the future.

""I think we can find meds over here"" you said. There was a singular bandage, and i felt true joy. Finally i could get out of being injured, and walk alongside my fellow raiders valiantly. Then i felt it. The dagger in my back. Or rather, the throbbing pain of a heavy bullet powered by true betrayal. You had lured me away from the company. As my raider flair hit the roof, i turned to you. ""You are worse than the robots,"" i said.

This said, i have no enemies. I will never find enemies in fellow raiders. I truly hope, that you find the light in this grim world, where we all sacrifice blood, sweat, and tears to merely make it another day. Us, the raiders, have a shared responsibility; a shared enemy. The ARC. I hope, that one day, you find that calling, that motivation, to keep on fighting against the arc, and to stop the mindless killing of fellow raiders, for absolutely no gain.

Now, i'm going to go grab a cup of *coffee.*

1pv1o02,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pv1o02/i_miss_everything_and_feel_guilty_about_it/,"I miss everything, and feel guilty about it.","I’m writing this out to hopefully make peace with it, as I’m struggling a lot as of late.  It’s Christmas Eve and I’m alone at this bar trying to make sense of it all.

I (36 M) ended things with my girlfriend (33 F) of 2.5 years about 6 weeks ago.  I was sure I was doing the right thing.  Our relationship started off long distance (we reunited after a 9 year absence), and seemed like something out of a movie.  We fell in love all over again, and I can honestly say I planned to spend my life with this person.  

After about a year and a half of being apart, we finally made the move to get her up to my city.  She was adamant that it was the right decision, as I had offered multiple times to move down to her in Texas, but she wanted a new start and my career here was doing well.  I started noticing the red flags pretty quickly on…

I have to be straightforward and say that she has personally been through a lot of trauma, and this is her first major major relationship.  Talking falling in love and planning the future, etc.  She’d also never lived anywhere outside of her home city (Austin), whereas I’ve moved around a bit, and now live in NYC.  So I knew right away that there were bound to be struggles.  We had already experienced some long distance drama:  pregnancy scare, miscommunications, small tiffs here and there, but what stood out the most was her anger.  She would get defensive over things that genuinely confused me, and when I would try to understand why, as patiently and gently as I could, I would get pushback and frustration and sometimes blowups that really made me feel anxious (I’ve been through a very angry relationship before and vowed never to let someone’s anger get the best of me), and when I tried to express how things were making me feel, her response would inevitably be “well you made me react that way, so it’s your fault.”  

Fast forward to the move in, and I was hoping the lack of distance would help our communication and right some of these wrongs.  I went back and forth for so long, trying to predict what she would want, trying to care for her, first directly, and then slowly, indirectly, because she told me she felt pressure from me to fix things, and it was making her feel smothered in a way.  So I backed off, but remained present, doing little things, picking up after her, making her coffee in the mornings, doing the laundry every week because going outside to the laundromat made her anxious.  I got her a job with my restaurant company, and now works in the neighborhood we live in.  But it didn’t matter.  She seemed miserable.  I would simultaneously feel like I was doing too much or never enough, depending on her reactions.  I would try to check in once in awhile, see how she was feeling this big move, hoping to provide me with some insight.  She would always brush it off and get defensive.  She said multiple times how much she hated her job, didn’t care for this city, hated the cold… I felt like I was failing to provide her with a proper landing pad here.   I paid for half of the move and drove her and her plants and cats up to NYC.  I thought I was going all the right things, setting her up for success here.  I would visit her constantly at work, trying to make her feel like she wasn’t alone.  But I started noticing things…

She had her ways of showing love of course, by cooking, cleaning, spending time with me, but the thing was, she never knew how to communicate the things she wanted.  And asking was out of the question, so slowly but surely, long standing frustrations she had about the relationship began to surface, things we had either worked out or whole new things I had no idea was bothering her, and always when she was angry.  Explosive.  I would be blindsided.  Things like “you didn’t try hard enough to make a case for moving to Austin”, and accuse me of creating issues when I wanted to address something that bothered me.  So, I would try to address the things that bothered her, and silently kept how I felt inside.  I was getting exhausted.  

The big blow came when the couples therapist I had hired for us effectively ended our sessions due to feeling uncomfortable when my ex lashed out to her when she was being asked questions.  She cussed out the therapist, and that was it.  End of session, end of therapy.  And nothing from her.  No apology, no trying to find another therapist (aside from suggesting her own again, which I was very hesitant about), and what I finally realized:  no accountability.  

Throughout the entire relationship, I hardly ever received an apology, even when I felt I deserved one.  The fight would end, her mean words that she said would linger, and I would be hesitant to even try to talk about what just happened for fear of sparking her anger again.  So very little got resolved.  We would just “move on”.  I tried wholeheartedly to forgive her every time this would happen, and then also forget so as to not to hold it against her.  I was quick to apologize, because I hated fighting, I never wanted to hurt her in any way, especially in my words, and I wanted resolution more than anything.  I know we are all human and inevitably react in human ways, but not taking accountability when you do shitty things is hard to reconcile with.

Towards the end, I definitely acted out.  I knew where it was going, and I knew I couldn’t keep doing this.  I gave warnings, saying I wasn’t happy, saying this isn’t normal for us or for couples, and that I’m thinking time away from each other might help (at this point, she had “ended” the relationship several times when she was angry, and then would take it back the next day or day after).  Nothing worked.  Things got worse.  I went out several weekends in a row after work and would get drunk until 3 am.  She would feel neglected.  I was trying to work up the courage to do what I knew I had to do, but was dragging my feet.  When I finally pulled the trigger, she pulled out all the stops and did literally everything she could to stop me from ending it.  But not through begging, pleading, compromising, or listening to my actual grievances, which she would not accept as actual grievances.  She used anger, and guilt-tripping, saying I was a horrible person for considering leaving her after everything, leaving her in this city, and abandoning her.  I agreed to wait a bit and think about things, but when I confirmed, she doubled down.  

I honestly thought she would’ve moved back home - that’s what she threatened so many times before.  I had offered everything in my power to set her up after she moved out.  I would pay for half the move back, I would do the move myself, I would do anything in my power to make sure she wasn’t doing this alone, that I wasn’t abandoning her.  I still loved her so much, and still do.  She stayed in NYC and moved about a 20 minute walk away, and still works across the street from our original apartment.  We have seen each other several times, moving stuff, generally getting together to catch up, offering her company so she isn’t alone.  

So here I am, still genuinely believing I’m a piece of shit, writing this out to remind me of what all happened (and this is only the surface) so that I’m not grieving the relationship so hard.  But I am.  I feel the weight and pain of this relationship in my chest, wracking my brain over and over again as to what I could’ve done to save it.  And because I was the one who ended it, I feel guilty for even feeling this way, and missing her.  I feel like I don’t deserve it.  I want her to be happy, but I’m so scared I’ll never get to see her get better, that someone else will get the best part of her, that she will find happiness that I couldn’t give her.  I feel like I failed.  And I want to be with her again, which feels so antithetical to everything I just experienced over the last two years.  It makes no rational sense, but that’s what my heart says.

Now that it’s over, my friends and family who were there for me think I’m so much better now, that I was being taken advantages of, despite liking her as a person, knew she was flawed.  I’ve been through heartbreak before, but this one feels like the final one.  The one that ends all my hope of finding someone I can be partners with.  All of our dreams, experiences, and hopes are gone, and I have no idea how to move forward.  I just miss my best friend, my lover, and partner.

If anyone else has gone through something like this, know you are not alone, and that sometimes protecting yourself from hurtful people is something that takes courage and will inevitably lead to a better life.  At least that’s what they say.  To everyone out there going through heartbreak on Christmas Eve, know you are not alone, and that I’m cheers-ing my drink to y’all.  Wherever you are out there, we still have tomorrow, and each other.  Sláinte, and merry holidays to you all.  Thanks for hearing my story.

First it started with the supervisor. She started by nitpicking the everyday normal things I did at work, such as the way I waited for the phone to ring twice before answering (to make sure the manager didn't answer in the office first.) She even berated me for cleaning the coffee machine ""too soon"". Then she got on my case for leaving to finish cleaning the restrooms I had left half-cleaned to cover for her while she stepped outside. 

She claimed I should have checked out the singular customer we had in the store first before walking away, even though she was also at the front counter and had a till assigned to her. When I told her she was also there and capable of helping the customer she told me it didn't matter. I asked her what was preventing her from helping the customer? I had an unfinished task I needed to get back to. That's when she started saying things like ""If you want to have a hostile workplace I'm fine with that."" And ""If you want to have it out then come have it out.""

Now ever since I try to work amicably with her but there is a noticeable difference in how she speaks to me and how she speaks to everyone else. I try to make an attempt to tell her that I am going to be in the kitchen for a little bit because I was asked to help out back there and her response is ""Bye"" in the tone of ""Bye, Felicia!""

She tells me I always wait until she has to go on break to start doing something so I started waiting until she's had her break before I start on my tasks. She then started pushing her breaks until the end of my shift but not communicating that with me so I'm waiting for her to take her break which she doesn't do and I end up not getting stuff done.

Now I've noticed another coworker who used to be amicable with me is now giving me the cold shoulder and I don't know what I did to offend him. We worked one shift together and he was friendly and talkative. He was also very helpful and kept insisting on doing everything (I assumed it was because I worked a double that day and had already been there 9 hours). I still didn't let him do *everything*.

We aren't a big store, we have less than 10 people working there. If we were a bigger supermarket I could easily ignore it, but these are people that I see and work with almost every day so it's frustrating being met with attitude nearly every day.",1,1766623711.0,RantsFromRetail,2,1.0,False

1pv1iul,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pv1iul/dulagal/,Dulagal,"I’ve been pretty much all around Australia. Take my word for it, the best way to see this country is by car. There’s just so many little hidden secrets and pockets of  paradise you miss if you try to do it all by bus or train, or simply jetting between the major cities.

My memories of road tripping Australia are for the most part positive. Sure there’s been some ups and downs along the way. But that’s life isn’t it? You just keep pushing forward. And that’s what I did.

There’s one notable stopover that still stands out though. An event which very nearly convinced me to pack in my adventurous spirit for good. I’ll recount this as best I can.

It was sometime around late September, a few years ago now, and I was headed from Barrage Bay up to Narooma. It’s a gorgeous coastal drive for the most part, aside from a little detour inland as you pass Wallaga Lake.

The best part of road tripping is the impulsivity, especially when you’re driving a fully equipped camper van like me. You can pull in just about anywhere for a break, as long as the area you’re pulling up at isn’t illegal for camping and what not… and so I did, as I came around the bending roads of that beautiful lakeside drive.

I found a picture perfect spot to camp out for the night. Remote, peaceful… just the way I liked it. I set up my camp, got a hot pot of coffee going, and kicked back in the deck chair soaking up the sun.

I got there right on sunset, so it was absolutely ideal. September can be a little warmer, but in the early mornings and creeping into the evenings that time of year, you won’t find better weather down under.

I was gazing out over those crystal clear blue waters, when I heard someone speak…

*“ungwarr ananyi”…*

Needless to say, this startled me. There was no one around, well there certainly hadn't been a moment ago anyway.

*“ungwarr ananyi”…*

Again! That same voice. That’s when I realised, there was no one around. I was hearing the voice in my head. Bloody hell, I must be out of it, I thought. It had been a long drive. 

***“ungwarr ananyi!!”***

Louder this time. And sending shockwaves through my head. Every time it spoke out, it was like the kick of a bass drum reverberating from the inside out of my brain. It hurt...

And this is when shit got real bizarre. Three kids came tearing out from the bush, breaking the tree line right behind my camper. They were shouting at me and pointing to the road, screaming “Go! Go! Leave now!”.

These kids were clearly Indigenous. Don’t get the wrong idea I don’t mean some stereotypical image of Indigenous Australian tribes living deep in the bush. They were just some local kids from a nearby camp. They sure seemed to know something I didn’t though. And it didn’t sound good.

I decided I’d best heed their advice. This, coupled with that weird voice was giving me a bad feeling. I packed up my stuff and scrambled back inside my camper. I strapped into the drivers seat, turned the engine over and flicked on the high beams. As I did so, the yellow beams of light shot straight into the dark bushland ahead, and illuminated something massive.

It was huge. I shit you not, 12 feet at the bare minimum. It had an almost spider like appearance, its arms and legs stuck straight out to the sides. Its face was pale white. I'm sure you're familiar with the Slenderman, right? The face on this thing was like him, but with a nasty scowl, his eyes beady and shimmering red. And its body... it was just like this shadowy, globby mass. In my head, the same voice from before, but it said nothing, just a low growl…

***“grrrrrrrrrr……..”***

The kids start bashing and kicking my camper now, but not like they meant me harm or anything, like they were urging me to leave. They screamed something out at me, a word I’ll never forget. “Dulagal! Dulagal!”, they shouted, over and over.

Again, that voice from before, but MUCH louder this time, echoed through my head.

*“ungwarr ananyi!!”*

I watched, as this thing slowly, yet deliberately, pivoted on its right foot, and then began walking sideways towards my car. No, really, it just kind of toppled from one stumpy leg to the other, blundering sideways toward my van. All the while, that pale white face was fixed on me... its angry expression contorting further and further as it got closer. That was it. I was out. I stepped on the pedal and floored it off down the highway.

As I sped off down the road, I caught glimpses of this abomination in my rearview mirror, wobbling sideways, step by step down the highway, following my car. Thankfully, it did not appear capable of picking up the kind of speed necessary to close the gap, and I watched as it slowly disappeared into the darkness of the night.

That was my first and last time to have ever witnessed anything in my travels I would call otherworldly. I did not need to look very far for answers as to what I bore witness to that dark September night. A simple search for a single word those kids shouted at me would turn up everything I needed to know…

“Dulagal”.

As I read the words from Google’s top result, the horror that I had encountered that night all fell into place…

*“The Dulagal is a large spider like creature of Aboriginal dreamings. It is said to have bright red eyes and it stalks Mount Gulaga. It is said that on dark nights, one might catch a glimpse of him, walking sideways across the planes”.*

Where I was camped was a straight shot south from Mount Gulaga. So, it fits. Why this thing was down by the lakeside when he’s said to stalk the mountain, I don’t know. Maybe he sees all this land surrounding the mountain as his territory. Maybe he was on the hunt. I don’t know.

This search did lead me to look into another phrase I heard that night. Those words which reverberated inside my mind over and over. This is of the Gooniyandi language, and it loosely translates into “please… go”.

What I can’t figure out is whether this voice in my head was the Dulagal, or something else. A protector spirit perhaps. This… Dulagal thing… it did not appear to have my best interests in mind. No, more than that, everything about its demeanour that night, looked as though it meant me harm.

The actions of the kids, too. They were frantically urging me to get out. Like they knew if I stayed there, something bad was gonna happen. If it weren’t for them, maybe it would have. But nah, I don’t reckon it was that Dulagal talking to me that night. He woulda been quite happy to sneak right up on me.

Still to this day I can’t shake the image of that awkward, sideways walk, as he lumbered out [from those trees...](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1pp85ru/my_stories/)",1,1766623555.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

My favorite coffee of the year I have to say was the Special Lot coffee from Liquid Dream. It was only 12 grams, and it was a gift from a shop owner in Cologne (Track One Coffee). It was one of five coffees that was included in a subscriber box. He deserves a massive shout-out! He makes amazing coffee, go visit if you are able to.

The species set from AMOC was a wild cupping experience, and I would love to try something like that again if a roaster has it available.

But our main character frequently dissociates. He sees people that arent there, talks to people he's imagining, even confuses real people with fake ones. He's not schizophrenic, he's Anti-Social Personality Disorder and on the ADHD spectrum. 

As the story progresses he get's more insane. He accidentally does things in real life that he thinks he's imagining. 

This is where the coffee gets thrown at each other. 

Our main character gets horribly injured. He's comatosed and 90% of the 2nd to last issue in the story takes place in the real world. Other characters making it work without our main. But there are 3 Coma Sequences. Each ammounting to 6 pages. In the beginning, middle and end.  

The final one is our main character being dragged to the bottom of the sea by people he loved or hurt. 

Dream sequences are typically a waste of time. But when done right they can illustrate someones mental state, or subconcious feelings. They can amplify a story by showing the audience what someones actually thinking. In this case, it's someone whos spent a lifetime running from their problems. Boarding a ship to escape. A ship that ultimately leads them into the danger.

Original recipe was from ChefSteps. Their recipe isn't 100% traditional, and is instead designed to get great results in 1-2 days.

(Paywall) [https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/classic-panettone-in-one-day](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/classic-panettone-in-one-day)

**Ingredients**

The recipe for the chocolate panettone

* 350g King Arthur organic bread flour
* 10g Central Milling vital wheat gluten (to boost the protein content of the flour, ideally you'd use 14%+ protein flour)
* 120g 1:1:0.5 fed sourdough starter (I fed 5-6 hours ahead and waited for it to triple in size)
* 10g Active dry yeast
* 180g Buttermilk
* 120g Egg yolk
* 82g Unsalted butter, soft
* 80g Sugar
* 10g Kosher salt
* 2g Vanilla bean seeds (from 5 pods)

  
Chocolate paste

* 18g Cocoa powder
* 18g Unsalted butter, soft
* 10g Sugar
* 10-13g Buttermilk
* 0.35g Salt
* 1g Espresso powder

  
Mixins

* 75g Dark chocolate chips
* 75g Milk chocolate chips
* 75g Dried tart cherry, soaked overnight in luxardo maraschino liqueur (or whisky, brandy, rum)

Topping

* Pearl sugar
* Egg wash

  
**Instructions**

*Watch the video I linked or buy a subscription to ChefSteps. I will summarize and show modification for chocolate version. This probably works to modify any panettone recipe.*

*\* marks the new steps*

1. Make starter base
2. \* Make chocolate paste by mixing the paste ingredients. Add 1-3 g butter milk if it's not loose enough.
3. Follow the first few mixing steps, adding the yolks, then the sugar, salt, and vanilla.
4. \* Mix in the chocolate paste in 3 additions, making sure it's fully incorporated between every addition
5. Follow the next mixing step for adding butter
6. \* Mix in the cherries and chocolate chips like the recipe suggests. The chocolate chips are quite hard to incorporate because they're oily, this took a long time and require pausing to fold the dough on itself a few times. 10-15min
7. \* Bulk ferment - the written recipe gives instructions to do this in the fridge overnight. Do this to make the time management easier. Remove from fridge 1 hour before stretch and fold. I had mine in the fridge about 13-15 hours.
8. Stretch and fold
9. Put in mold and proof (I proofed 4.5 hours at 80F, next time I will plan 1-2 more hours to complete the proof)
10. Bake
11. Flip and then cool 4 hours minimum
12. Serve

**Mascarpone cream**

We stopped in Milan for our honeymoon and had the best panettone ever served with mascarpone cream, and it was divine.

Ingredients, measured by weight

* 2 part heavy cream
* 2 part mascarpone
* 1 part icing sugar 
* Vanilla extract, didn't measure, put whatever you feel
* Optional: other flavorings.

Steps

1. Make loose whipped cream with everything except mascarpone.
2. Add mascarpone and whip until it just thickens a bit (not too much because it might split.
3. Ideally the consistency is loose enough that you can easily dip the light bread in it. If it's too thick, you can eat it with a spoon instead.

For the chocolate panettone, I just did vanilla extract as the flavor. For the more traditional one I made last week with cherries and orange, I added the zest of an orange.

  
Panettone is delicious with tea, coffee, digestive, cocktail.

What I noticed was that if I took my dose on an empty stomach, it was sorta Russian roulette on whether it'd have me sorta shaky and twitchy ""internally"", regardless of whether it was the 10mg or 20mg dose. If you're experiencing this, obviously bring it up with the doctor, but I found it was only a ""Sometimes"" thing. My doses were a LOT smoother when I had something to eat, and not stuff like cake or smth, because that would actually make my side effects WORSE, but something with a good amount of protein and carbs.

I should probably start by saying that this is my first time ever posting something like this, so please bear with me. I’m not even sure this is the right place to post, and this will likely turn into a long rant.

So, i'm a 28 yo man, and about six months ago I broke up with my now ex-girlfriend (29F) of two years. I was actually planning on proposing to her this winter. To make things even more complicated, we still work at the same company. Saying the breakup was hard doesn’t even begin to cover it, but this will be relevant later, so I’ll leave it there for now.

The six months that followed were brutal. I lost interest in everything I used to enjoy, drowned my emotions in food, gained a lot of weight, and barely slept, maybe two hours a night on average. It was rough.

Eventually, things started to improve, or at least I thought they were. I felt like I was finally healing.

I began spending more time with my team at work. We’d have lunch together, take breaks, and just hang out more as a group. Within this team, there was one girl who stood out. She wasn’t my usual type, and at first I didn’t even find her particularly attractive (not saying she wasn't beautiful), but there was something different about her. Her energy felt different.

Let’s call her Julia (29F).

Julia and I started talking casually, with no expectations or hidden intentions. We’d have lunch together, tease each other, share inside jokes. She laughed at my terrible, and I mean *terrible* jokes. She’d ask what I was ordering and I’d order for her. She started coming by my desk to smell my perfumes, sometimes spraying some on herself. I’d always tell her when I got a new one. She’d ask me to open the caps of her drinks when she couldn’t. Our eyes would meet across the office and we’d smile at each other. She’d make heart shapes with her hands in my direction. I’d help her with work when she needed it. I genuinely thought we were building a solid friendship.

Somewhere along the way, I started developing a crush on her. A big one. I don’t think I made it obvious, but I knew it wasn’t a good idea. I told myself I wouldn’t act on it, but I couldn’t stop how I felt, and we started talking more and more.

One day, Julia wasn’t feeling well and ended up getting sick. The next day, I brought her some chocolate. She thought it was sweet and appreciated the gesture.

What I didn’t account for was the fact that I still work with my ex. She saw all of this and started telling people there was something going on between Julia and me. They weren’t close, but they got along and sat next to each other in our open-space office.

Julia eventually heard the gossip and confronted me about it, asking if I knew anything, which I didn’t. I apologized for what she’d been put through and told her I’d understand if she wanted some distance. She dismissed that almost immediately.

At the same time, Julia was having a hard time at work. Despite her efforts, she wasn’t meeting her deadlines and was even considering quitting. We made a deal: if she stuck it out a bit longer, I’d take her out for sushi. She agreed, and we sealed it with a pinky promise.

When the day of our unofficial date came, I had shaved, showered, and was getting ready when she texted me saying she had to cancel because her sister, who lives abroad, had come to visit. She asked if we could reschedule. I was disappointed because I’d been looking forward to it, but I told her it was completely fine and that we could do it another time.

A couple of weeks later, things were still going well. Julia had changed departments, but we stayed in close contact. Since her birthday was coming up, I decided to properly invite her out to dinner. This happened while we were having lunch with a colleague, let’s call her Cynthia (26F). I also mentioned that Cynthia was welcome to join us if she wanted. I didn’t want to make things awkward, and since Julia and Cynthia were close, I thought it might ease the situation.

Cynthia looked at Julia with a knowing smile and said, “I mean, you’re the one he’s asking out.” That kind of smile, you know, the one that suggests there might be something more. They both laughed, and Julia accepted the invitation.

We planned to go out the following Friday, right after work. I made reservations at a new, upscale restaurant that I knew she’d like, it fit her vibe perfectly. I also got her a gift. She loves tea and coffee, so I bought a cute coffee mug with a heart-hands design, the same gesture she often made toward me. It came as a pair, so I kept the other one, thinking we’d match.

Cynthia decided to come along, so after work we headed to the restaurant. Everything was great : the food, the music, the atmosphere. Julia told me I’d really nailed it with the choice. We talked, joked, and laughed all night. It felt easy and natural.

At one point, Julia received a text and showed it to Cynthia, who immediately said, “Oh my god, look at the time : it means he’s thinking about you.” That caught me off guard, but I brushed it off.

Before we left, I gave Julia her gift. She loved it, and her reaction genuinely made me happy.

I paid the bill, and we left. I dropped Cynthia off first, then Julia. We talked and joked a bit more, nothing suggestive, just casual conversation. When I dropped her off, she thanked me again and said she’d had a wonderful time. I asked her to text me when she got home, which she did. We said goodnight, and she asked me to text her when I got home as well.

The next morning, she sent me a picture of the mug filled with coffee, saying she loved it and thanking me again, i sent her a pic of me using mine.

On Sunday, since Julia had only recently moved back to the country, Cynthia took her to another city to explore, something they did most weekends. Coincidentally, I was planning to go to the same city that day to check out a phone store I’d mentioned to Julia. We were supposed to see each other there, but our schedules didn’t line up, and she had an appointment she couldn’t miss. Still, we stayed in touch throughout the day.

Later that evening, I went to the beach to clear my head and picked out a few nice-looking rocks I thought she’d like, she’s into that kind of thing, as well as a seashell she could use to decorate her new apartment. I sent her a picture of the beach but didn’t mention the gift.

Monday is when everything shifted.

Julia came into work visibly upset. When I asked what was wrong, she brushed it off, saying she hadn’t slept well and felt strange because the “energies were shifting.” I told her I’d also slept badly and felt off, which was true, even if I don’t really believe in that sort of thing.

I asked her to come by my desk when she had a moment because I had something for her, I was trying to cheer her up. She stopped by briefly, but I didn’t get the chance to give her the rocks and shell.

After that, we barely spoke. That day turned into a week. Her energy towards me completely changed. She felt distant, avoided eye contact, and when she did look at me, it felt cold. We didn’t hang out. We exchanged maybe four texts all week. Even Cynthia started acting strangely.

It felt like Julia suddenly stopped seeing me altogether, and that hurt more than I expected.

Eventually, I asked her directly if everything was okay between us. She replied, “Why wouldn’t it be?” and asked what I meant. I told her I felt like something had been off since her birthday.

She said she was completely done with the company and relieved it was her last week before going on holiday for Christmas and New Year’s. She asked again what felt off. I told her it probably made sense, that maybe I was just picking up on a weird vibe on my end.

But her messages were short and disengaged. She left me on delivered, then replied the next morning with a dry “Morning, all right, have a good day.” I answered, and she left me on read.

I keep asking myself what I did wrong.

This hurt far more deeply than I expected. It reopened wounds I thought were healing from my breakup. I cried the entire weekend, and I still don’t fully understand why. Why does this hurt so much?

When I talked to a close friend about it, he told me it probably wasn’t about *her* specifically. It could have been anyone. He said I was craving attention and affection, and she gave me that. I got attached too quickly, and because I was still healing, the pain felt amplified.

Part 1

Wind battered relentlessly on the exterior of red pickup as is it barreled down the long stretch of highway. Two young men occupy the front seats. The driver has a stocky frame, and sits at-the-ready. While the passenger is slouches towards his side of the vehicle, staring at the river beside them.



""How long?"" Asked the passenger, followed by a wheezing cough.



Foul stenches filled the inside of the cabin; An unsavory mix of saliva, sweat, and used cannabis. The driver let off the gas for a moment and released his left hand from the worn wheel of the vehicle. He began to quickly roll down the window, letting out a similar cough in the process.



""About 9, wanna take over?"" He takes a moment to inhale a long breath as small pellets of hail infiltrate the interior, followed by a strong gust of icy wind.



""Of course Bro! Let's just st-"", Yelled Passenger, before he could finish, Driver rolled up the window. ""You could've left that open, it's cool.""



""I'm all right now; just wanted a little fresh air."" Driver scratched at a section of razor burn high up on his cheekbone. ""We'll swap at the next gas station, hopefully somewhere with coffee.""



""Sounds good.""



They continued on for several silent miles, until Driver spotted an AM/PM.



Driver hopped out of the truck and clutched his baseball cap as another hard gust of air shoved past. He wore a burgundy sweater, dirty size 14 hiking boots, and a pair of dark-grey cargo-style pants with large pockets, all bulging slightly. His rear pockets appeared empty while his wallet and cellphone sat in his left and right front pockets, respectively. With a plain-looking leather belt holding it in place.



Letting out a large groan, he stretched then looked behind the front seats as Passenger leapt out of the vehicle. ""Yo, Theo!""



Theo let out a similar groan as he stretched his legs and began touching his toes, his uncouth dirty-blonde hair falling to just a couple inches above the ground. He wore an oversized hoodie stuffed with a sandwich-sized bag of marijuana, a small glass pipe, paperclip, and an empty Bic lighter. Baggy blue jeans sat crooked on this thin waist in absence of a belt. Clunky size 12 shoes desperately clung to his feet, adorned with worn soles and beat up toe-boxes.



""What's up?!"" He shouted beneath the truck.



The direction of the sound made Driver jump momentarily. He scanned his surroundings and saw a large dumpster alongside the station. ""Let's toss this shit before we head out; getting ripe in there.""



""Copy that. The usual?"" Asked Theo.



Driver nodded.



The pair split up as soon as they entered the establishment, Theo went straight for snacks and necessities, while the driver went for coffee. He seemed displeased with the coffee selection. First tried the Maxwell House, but winced at as he did so. Next he went for the Folgers, but noted that the grounds in its reservoir were completely full, while the dispenser and subsequent tray beneath, remained covered in dust, untouched.



""You must be the un-popular one,"" he muttered to himself. Looking over to the third option, he continued muttering, ""that just leaves you.""



He topped off his own vessel with some creamers then unloaded ten into Passenger's cup. The steam seemed to feel good on the driver's face, so he opted to forego the lid on his own drink. He capped off the passenger's coffee, pocketed an extra handful of creamers, and started walking towards the counter.



The two men head towards the cashier. She must have been around 50 years old. A short woman, with hair that fell to her shoulders. Theo gingerly rested a pile in front of the woman: Two bags of peach rings, two bags of butter-toffee peanuts, two bags of southwest trail mix. A bottle of Ibuprofen, a six pack of Coronas, a new lighter, a small bag of Teriyaki flavored beef jerky, and a tall can of Sour Cream and Onion Pringles. ""Hey, do you guys have a restroom?"" Asked Theo.



She nodded and turned to grab a key with a large toilet scrubber attached by a length of paracord.

""Just down the hall,"" she pointed down a short hallway. ""Door on the right. That towel things likes to jam, be nice to it.""



""Sounds good, I'll be right back for that,"" Theo nodded, and made a brisk walk down the hall, loudly shutting the door behind him. ""Didn't mean to do that!"" He yelled.



The cashier gave a soft chuckle, ""where're you boys headed?"" Her voice sounded calm but frail, as if she had been shedding tears not too long ago. A stark contrast from her hands that raced across the surface of the table, grabbing, scanning and bagging items.



The driver grabbed the Ibuprofen and sat it back on the shelf before she could scan it, ""We're on our way to Glacier National Park right now; trying to visit all of them on this trip.""



""Oh my gosh, what a trip! Are you sure this will be enough for you two?"" Asked the woman in a sincere tone.



""We'll be passing through Spokane in a few hours. We can stock up again there.""



""Fair enough, I.D?"" She held out her free hand.



The driver quickly pulled a card out of his wallet and handed it to her. She froze, her voice choked, ""I-I'm sorry I just need your drivers license."" She handed it back, he looked down at the piece of plastic and apologized.



""Sorry ma'am, my mistake."" He pulled his drivers license out and handed it to the woman, he waited a moment as she inspected it, slowly. ""You okay?""



She looked up from the card and wiped one of her eyes. ""Y-yes,"" She composed herself, ""That'll be $25.97.""



The bathroom door creaks loudly as it swings open, grabbing the cashier and driver's attention



Theo walks out patting his hands on his hoodie and pants, noticing the receipt in the driver's hand he shouts from across the mini-mart, ""What the hell man? Thought I was getting this one.""



""You are."" Driver turned his attention to the cashier, ""Can I also get $50 on pump 2?""



""Of course, dear."" She said warmly.



""Oh so it's like that?"" Theo said sarcastically, as he handed the woman a crumpled $50 bill out of his hoodie. She looked down at the bill with a minor look of disgust before swiping it with a pen to confirm its legitimacy.



""Should be good to go now, here's the receipt."" She starts handing the receipt to Theo, but he refuses.



""Sorry ma'am, I don't wanna leave a paper trail."" Said Theo after grabbing a bag and his coffee then walking out of the automatic double-doors. She rolled her eyes and threw the receipt into a small trash can behind the counter. Driver followed behind, shortly after exchanging a smile with the cashier and also grabbing his coffee and a bag.



As Driver was about to leave, she ran around the counter. She firmly wrapped her thin arms around Drivers waist and buried her face into the small of his back, sobbing. The driver was stunned, all he could do was turn around to see the woman's face.



""I'm so sorry."" She sobbed, stepping away. ""M-my son was, he. He was. They sent him t-""



""It's okay, what was his name?"" Asked Driver in a soft tone.



Theo looked back at them through the storefront's windows, from the pump stall. Once he got the driver's attention he mouthed 'what the fuck?' and gestured at a imaginary watch on his wrist. The driver nodded.



""I oughta get going ma'am, I'm sorry about your son.""



""Please,"" she wiped her eyes one last time, ""just be careful,""



""I will."" The driver walked out of the mini-mart with a waving gesture towards the old woman.



""What the hell was that about?"" Theo squinted at the driver as he approached.



""Her son was National Guard; killed during the Liberty Collapse. His name was George... we sort of look a like, I guess.""



""Damn."" Theo looked down then gave a half-hearted chuckle hopping back into the truck. As he begun to adjust his seat he asked, ""Do you think he knew Briarwood? ""



""How the hell should I know?"" Said Driver, as he round the back of the vehicle and began adjusting the passenger seat. ""If they did,"" he grunted as he pulled up on the seats lever, ""It wouldn't have been for long, Briar only transferred last Spring.""



""Oh yeah, good point."" Said Theo as he slowly buckled himself in. He gripped the steering wheel with his left hand then gestured with the other towards Driver who handed him a small set of keys. After switching on the ignition, he grabs the gear shift but hesitates. ""Hey Nik?""



""What's up man?"" Asked Nik with a raised eyebrow.



""Do you ever get the urge to get back out there?""



Nik faced towards windshield, and spoke clearly. ""Every day.""



The two men continue their journey for a couple hours before Theo begins to cough.



""Oh shit, we totally forgot to dump all this"" Theo gestured with his thumb at the mound of trash in the back seats. ""There's a Safeway in Spokane, we can just unload there.""



""Sounds good... we should've taken that last exit though."" Said Nik as he rolled down his window. He sat staring at the swollen Spokane River, watching the churning waters eat up vegetation along the banks, rising diligently.



""No dude, it says right here on th-""



In an instant, a large portion of the road in front of them is swallowed whole.



""Fuck!"" Screams Theo, in a panic he slams on the breaks and veers the car to the right, slightly off the highway. Upon leaving the paved road, the passenger-side tires lurch downward as more of the foundation slips away. Theo starts backing up, but the tires find no purchase on the asphalt.

The truck begins to slip further into the river while Theo easily climbs out. As he does so, the weight distribution is thrown off; Nik's side is sent further down. Theo sprints to the bed, grabs ahold and squats down; Slightly altering the course of the careening pickup. Nik scrambles out of his seatbelt, crawls over the center console and falls on top of the remaining road. Letting out a loud grunt as he fell onto his right shoulder. As Nik falls, so does the vehicle; Forcing Theo to lose his grip, slicing open his palms and sending him backwards, slamming the back of his head on the unkempt portion of the road.



Nik dusts himself off as the Lariat is eaten by the ravenous current, ""I'm sorry,"" he whispers to himself.



To his right he sees Theo, unconscious. Turning him over to inspect his injuries, Nik let's out a sigh of relief and scoops him up off the ground, as if carrying an infant. As the rain grew more intense and pieces of the highway continued to unravel, Nik's only choice was to venture in to the woods.



He goes on for what must have felt hours for him, until coming across my clearing. In the center sits a large wooden door, marking the entry. Drawing closer, he is able to see the neatly chip-carved geometry of this piece. Undulating curves rippled across it's deep, somber-hued surface, as if it were being seen through murky red water. Hoisting Theo onto the other shoulder, he grabbed hold of the handle. The bronze casting coils elegantly into the hand, urging him to open the door and cross unto my threshold. As he opens the door they both fall; The ground beneath them was suddenly almost a meter below where it had just sat. Nik cradled Theo's head and began to turn them both sideways as they hit the wet cobblestones, hard. Crawling over to Theo, Nik turned him on to his side, then he too went unconscious. All that remained was the buzzing sound of traffic, and strange, unfamiliar voices flying by the men as they sat curled up on the streets of Moscow.

There was a comfortable but unremarkable colonial-style house on a tree-lined plot of land, on a quiet street, at the edge of a quiet suburb.

The lawn was green without being lush, trimmed often enough that it never drew a comment or complaint from neighbors.  The trees and shrubs near the house, too, were trimmed and shaped in a way that suggested routine maintenance and not dramatic upheaval.  The siding had been painted within the last few years, the color chosen from a narrow band of safe neutrals that aged well and never looked out of place.  The house had been built to last, but not to impress.  Its proportions were familiar, its angles expected, its presence reassuring precisely because it offered nothing surprising.

Inside, the air was cool and still, conditioned just enough to take the edge off the early summer’s warmth.  The faint smell of clean fabric and coffee hung in the living room, neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just present.  Mid-afternoon sunlight filtered in through the windows, softened by blinds that had been adjusted once years ago and then left alone.  A few dust motes drifted lazily in the light, visible only when the sun caught them just right.

A man was sitting on a couch in the sunken living room, his weight settled into the cushions in a way that suggested he had been there for some time.  He was average in every way that mattered and some that didn’t: average height, average build, average posture.  Middle-aged, but not dramatically so—his hair graying a little at the temples, his face carrying the faint lines of habitual expressions rather than stress or anger.  He wore jeans and a soft T-shirt, the sort that had been washed enough times to lose any stiffness, and socks instead of shoes, his feet resting flat on the carpet.  One arm lay draped along the back of the couch, the other resting loosely in his lap.

He wasn’t doing anything in particular. There was nothing he was waiting for, nothing that needed to happen next.  The day had settled into that quiet, unremarkable middle space where time passed without requiring attention.  His breathing was slow and even. Every so often he shifted his weight slightly, more out of habit than discomfort.

The television was on, a cable sports network.  He was watching baseball, or something like it.  The screen showed a game, but not a live one.  There was no sense of shared time, no awareness that events were unfolding elsewhere in the same moment.  It was a highlight reel, edited down to a tight, efficient two hours—a condensation with the pauses, delays, and dull stretches removed.  Pitch after pitch, hit after hit, the game reduced to its useful components.  The announcers spoke with practiced enthusiasm, their voices polished and steady, untroubled by uncertainty.

He looked at the screen, only half-interested. His eyes followed the ball when it mattered and drifted when it didn’t.  He had already seen some of these plays before—he knew that, even if he couldn’t remember exactly when.  The familiarity didn’t bother him.  Baseball was good for that; it offered repetition without demand, variation within strict limits.  The rules rarely changed. The outcomes did, but they didn’t require participation.

A runner slid into second.  The shortstop scooped the ball cleanly and pivoted, throwing to first in one smooth motion.  The announcer’s voice lifted as the double play completed, a neat, efficient ending to the inning.  The man on the couch watched it happen, registered it, felt the small, automatic satisfaction of closure.

The broadcast cut to a commercial.

The sound changed, the rhythm breaking into something brighter and louder.  He barely noticed.  He let the noise wash over him, his attention drifting further now that nothing on the screen required it.  The light in the room hadn’t changed.  The house was quiet in the way it always was at that hour, insulated from the street and from urgency.  Empty except for him, his belongings, and the things that made a house a home—even for one unremarkable person.

Then his phone rang.

It was ringtone-like, distinct but not especially noteworthy.  A hypnotic, simplistic melody of sorts, just a few notes repeating themselves.

He sat up quickly and grabbed the phone off the table.  He recognized the number.  He knew what it was going to be before he saw it, but he confirmed it anyway.

He answered, but didn’t raise the phone to his ear. He waited a few seconds—no sound from the phone—then pressed the end-call button.

He dialed another, different number from memory.  As he did so, he stood from the couch and went to the small study off of the living room.  There, as the phone rang, he searched the pencil drawer.  He found the small printed card, slightly larger than a business card, the one with two columns of numbers on it in black and red.

The line rang a few more times, then clicked as it was answered.  A generic, forgettable, banal melody of four notes played.  Not like the ringtone, but equally bland.  A jingle, something that plays at the end of a commercial.

A recorded voice followed.  A man’s, neutral, accent-less, friendly but devoid of emotion— an automated announcement at an airport, or the kind used for corporate customer service lines.

“Welcome to Bright Hill,” the recorded voice said. “Enter your subscriber number now.”

The man scanned the card in his hand, counting down the column of numbers on the left. He stopped his thumb on the sixth one and dialed the numbers verbatim into the phone.

A click from the other end, then the recorded voice again.  “Enter your password now.”

The man’s thumb traced across to the other column of numbers, and he dialed that one into the phone, then pressed the pound key.

A few soft clicks, a pause, more clicks.

An automated voice came from the other end.  Primitive-sounding by modern standards, it was mechanical and slightly stilted, the cadence unmistakably machine-like.

“This message is for personnel in the following operational tiers.  Adam Three.  Boy Two…Boy Three.  Charles One…Charles Two…Charles Three.  David Three…David Four.”

There was a brief pause before the voice continued.

“If you are not in one of the preceding operational tiers, hang up now and contact your first line supervisor.”",1,1766621706.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False
1pv0z7k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pv0z7k,Uselessness of Merits and candleberries grind after wipe,"So, right before the wipe, I was grinding for 5 mil (stopped at 3 mil to avoid burnout, lol), and I ended up completing the Xmas battle pass. That gave me a ton of candleberries — but I couldn’t spend them on the Flickering Flames project because I was stuck needing a single coffee pot. Then the wipe happened, and I lost a bunch of candleberries that I could’ve used on the final stage of the project.

Another thing: completing project stages gives Merit points for the battle pass, which feels pointless if your BP is already finished. I get that the BP and the project are meant to be completed together. Ideally, you get around 180/260 berries from hitting 12,000 BP points, and about 10,000/16,000 points from completing the project itself — so some grinding is expected.

And yeah, before anyone says it: “stop min-maxing and just enjoy the game” — I do. This isn’t a complaint. My main point is that the event runs until January 11th, which is plenty of time to finish everything, especially with the winter holidays. Once both are done, any extra Merits just become useless.

At first, I thought maybe extra Merits could be converted into seeds, but honestly, why not candleberries instead? That way, busy players wouldn’t need to grind berries as much, and players who already finished the project could recycle them into seeds or sell them. Feels like a win-win.

She asked my name for the order, turns out I have a weakness for pretty girls saying my name. 

I mindlessly checked my email on my phone while I listened in to the workers conversation. She was talking about wanting to travel on some historic trails. A trail I've been learning more about recently.

As my order was up I chimed in to the conversation, some tidbit turned in to a joke. We talked briefly about my horse riding experience before I had to leave for work. 

I got about halfway down the block before turning around. I could only feel my heart pounding as I opened the door as was greeted to her smile. I said I wanted to leave my number for her.

He went ahead and suggested a Starbucks that was 25min from where I live. I'm all for coffee dates and I appreciate he picked a spot closer to me but something about a chain Starbucks as a halfway meeting point given our age (we're both in our 30s) and he has a stable engineering job gave me the ick.

Chapter 1

Time doesn’t pass in this place it accumulates. I don’t know how long I was confined to the parking lot. A thousand years. Maybe even a million. I eventually learned the secret language of shopping carts. I understood the unique wobble of every rusted wheel. I can easily recognize the specific shriek of a misaligned frame. I knew them better than I had ever known my own self. I’m mad to admit how I got here. I shouldn’t have carelessly left that shopping cart in that open parking spot. But I am in hell, and rounding up shopping carts is my punishment.

My punishment is brutally simple and entirely eternal. I was tasked with gathering carts from an endless lot that stretched toward a shimmering horizon of heat. My job was to connect them into long trains, then push them into the corrals. I would nest them perfectly until they formed an orderly monument to my own meticulous diligence.

Then the wind would inevitably come. It was never a natural breeze but always a personal insult to my work. A targeted supernatural gust that would tear through the lot with malicious intent. It would lift my perfectly gathered carts and scatter them like spilled coins across the pavement. They would roll into drainage ditches. Get wedged between curbs and up onto sidewalks. They’d careen into the pristine sides of classic cars I couldn’t physically touch. And then I would simply start again.

I performed this mindless task until the words “shopping cart” lost all meaning. I continued until my own name felt like it belonged to someone else. I was no longer Gary, the man who died from a gas station taquito. Instead I was a mindless automaton whose only purpose was to push, pull, and gather. My hope was a fossilized husk and my anger had been slowly scoured away by the sandpaper of repetition. My punishment has turned my original feelings of defeat into a smooth, hard core of pure unadulterated resentment.

Today I was pushing a train of about fifty carts when a particularly strong gust of wind struck the convoy. The cart at the very front suddenly broke free from the train. It did not simply roll but rocketed across the asphalt. At dangerous speeds it slammed head first into the driver's side door of a pristine, 1970s Lincoln Continental.

The sharp crunch of metal echoed across the silent lot. It was a violent sound. All i could do was sigh in irritation.

Something inside me stirred. That hard and smooth core of resentment finally fractured under the pressure.

I immediately released the handle of the remaining train and did not even bother to watch as the rest of the carts scattered across the pavement. I simply did not care anymore. I turned my back on the entire scene and started walking. As I walked away from the lot a small bricked building lined with windows shimmered into existence directly ahead of me. The beige waiting room from my initial arrival peering at me through the windows. Everything appearing like a mirage of purgatorial bureaucracy.

I pushed through the door of the building and marched straight up to the counter where Barry, my demon probational worker, was standing. He wasn’t technically my enlisted policing authority. He was however, the first and only human-like entity I’ve had to deal with. He processed me into hell and lead me to my assignment in the very beginning. I remember having to grab a ticket and sit in his small beige waiting room occupied by no one besides me and wait several hundreds of years to be called.

""Is there a problem with your designated station?"" he mumbled while misting a single sad looking leaf, not even looking up

""I need to speak with a manager right now,"" I said, my voice filled with desperation and anger.

Barry finally looked at me. His dull gray eyes widening with genuine surprise. ""A manager. Sir, the system is the system. The cart gathering assignment is a Level Three Damnation, which is completely non-negotiable.""

""I honestly do not care about the carts anymore,"" I said, leaning my entire body over the counter. ""I want to file a formal complaint about the wind. It is aggressive and it feels personal. I am certain that this kind of treatment is against some type of union regulation down here.""

Barry could only stare at me, his mouth hanging slightly agape. He had processed the screams of the damned for an eternity to come. But a formal complaint about the weather was more than likely something entirely new to him.

""I do not believe we actually have a form for that particular issue,"" he stammered.

""Then get me someone who is responsible for creating the forms,"" I demanded with sudden force. ""Right now!""

He blinked once and then slowly and deliberately picked up the telephone and pressed a single button. He spoke into the receiver in a hushed reverent tone. After a moment he hung up the phone and looked back at me. There was a flicker of something that might have been genuine fear visible in his eyes. ""He will see you now.""

A door behind the counter swung open revealing a long hallway that smelled faintly of burnt coffee and profound regret. I did not hesitate for even a second. It was finally time for me to demand my performance review.

Chapter Two

The deeper I walked down the hallway the more closed in I felt. It was long and gray. It had low ceilings that made the space feel oppressive, as if the building itself was stressed from being in Hell. The door at the end was black with a single polished brass handle that felt cold to the touch. I figured that if since I survived an eternity of shopping carts then a bureaucratic meeting could not be worse.

I pushed the door open and stepped into an office.

It was not the throne of fire and shadow I had expected. It was no simpler than a corner office. A large mahogany desk sat in front of a panoramic window that did not look out upon lakes of fire but upon a sea of clouds under a blood red sky. The walls were lined with binders labeled things like ""Q4 Torment Projections"" and ""Union Negotiations (Pitchfork Local 666)."" Behind the desk was a man in an impeccably tailored suit rubbing his temples. The nameplate on the desk said L. SATAN, CEO.

He was on the phone. His voice choppy with the kind of irritation only a person dealing with terrible customer service can create. ""No, I understand the extended warranty is very comprehensive, but I'm telling you, the toaster is damned! It's a flaw, not a feature!... Yes, I'll hold."" He slammed the phone down, the crack echoing in the quiet office. He glared at me. ""What.""

I stood my ground. ""My punishment. The shopping carts. It's not a suitable fit.""

He raised an eyebrow. A flicker of amusement crossed his face. ""Not a suitable fit. Gary, you left a cart in a handicapped spot. The paperwork alone caused a demonic clerk to take a three day stress leave. It's a perfect fit.""

""The wind is personal,"" I said, the words feeling foolish as soon as they left my mouth. ""And it's repetitive. There is no room for growth if I’m expected to learn something here.""

Satan leaned back in his chair. A predatory smile spreading across his face. ""Growth. I see."" He steepled his fingers. ""You're not a screamer. I like that. The screamers are so dreadfully predictable. But you... you're an interesting kind of sinner. You’re the mundane kind. You think your sin was small. So your punishment should be small. You don't understand. Hell isn't about the magnitude of the sin, Gary. It's about the theme. Your theme is carelessness. A small and insidious carelessness that frays the edges of civilization.""

He snapped his fingers. A shimmering document appeared on his desk. ""So I'm going to offer you a deal. A chance at a lateral transfer. Let’s call it the Gauntlet of Minor Annoyances. You need to successfully navigate nine circles of my personal hell. Each one themed around a different brand of carelessness. Beat them all and I'll find you a more specialized position. Something with a little more variety. Fail, and you get a thousand years in the 'Reply-All' mines. Do we have a deal, Gary?""

I looked at the document then at his smiling face. A thousand years of Reply-All emails. I would take the these circles.

""Deal,"" I said.

""Excellent,"" Satan said, clapping his hands together. ""Let's begin with the fundamentals, shall we?""

The office dissolved. The mahogany desk and the view of the clouds vanished. Everything replaced by the cold echoing space of a massive underground chamber. Before me was an escalator. It descended into a deeper darkness. Its metal steps endlessly disappearing into the gloom carrying passengers cramped between the handrails. The passengers boarding formed a line that snaked throughout the chamber shuffling slowly with the escalators speed. Damned souls. All of them waiting in line, zoned out, and going down.

""Circle One,"" Satan's voice echoed around me, though he was nowhere to be seen. ""The Escalator of Eternal Stillness. The rules are simple. Stand on the right, walk on the left. Your task is to get to the bottom. Without pushing. Without losing your temper.""

“I’m confused,” I said, my face twisted with a weird disappointment. “How is this task considered careless?”

Satans laugh felt annoyed. “The people you see before you are damned because they occasionally, if not once, had blocked the left side of an escalator in their lifetime.”

I walked towards the escalator and peered down into the darkness. The escalator being swallowed into it. “I don’t get it.”

“Look,” Satan said sighing. I could feel him getting irritated with me. “It’s not your culture but it is for others. You do not block the left side of an escalator.”

I didn’t respond. It didn’t matter. I need to get through these circles. I took a deep breath and stepped towards the escalator. ""Excuse me,"" I said politely to the first person blocking my path. He didn't move. He didn't even blink. I tried to squeeze past him but he shifted just enough to block me completely. This was not a test of strength. It was a test of will. 

Before the escalators next passenger boarded I quickly jumped on. I quickly looked back. Not one eye staring me down angrily. I then began the slow agonizing decent. I said ""excuse me"" a hundred times. A thousand. Each time I was met with a vacant stare or an annoyed sigh. It was as if I were the one being unreasonable. I weaved and bobbed. A fish swimming upstream against a current of pure apathy. The climb down felt like it took years. My frustration built. A hot knot in my stomach started to form. I wanted to scream. I wanted to shove them all off into the the abyss.

But then I remembered the wind. The endless, pointless, infuriating wind. This was no different. It was just another kind of obstacle. My anger cooled. I stopped fighting it. I became a patient shadow. I began to slip through the cracks of their inattention. Finally, after what felt like an age, I reached the bottom step and stepped onto solid ground.

The world shimmered and faded. I was standing once again in the beige waiting room. The sign above the counter changed from ""PLEASE WAIT"" to ""CIRCLE ONE: COMPLETE."" Barry looked up from his ficus plant and gave me a single nod. It felt like respect. I had passed the first test. Eight more circles of hell to go.

Chapter Three

The beige of the waiting room faded and was replaced by the cold scent of concrete and dust. I was standing in the middle of a multi level parking garage that stretched upward and downward into an impenetrable gloom. The low hum of fluorescent lights overhead was the only sound. Row after row of cars stretched out before me. They were a monument to poor decisions.

""Circle Two,"" Satan's voice echoed through the cavernous space. ""The Parking Lot of Spatial Entropy. Your task is simple, Gary. Find one legal parking spot. Then park in it.""

Before I raised a question about how I could park a car when I didn’t have one, I heard a noise behind me. I turned to look to see a vehicle idling. I knew it was for me. A 1997 Geo Tracker, very tiny and compact. I got in, put it in drive and began my journey to find this open parking space to park in.

The first level was a disaster. Every spot was taken. Whoever had parked these vehicles did so very carelessly. A luxury sedan was parked so crookedly it was taking up two prime spots near an elevator. A compact car space was home to a lifted diesel truck. A motorcycle was parked diagonally across the last available spot at one end giving the illusion from a distance it was free. I drove on and on and on and on. The first level was just the beginning, it just kept getting worse on each level.

The 2,563rd level was the worse one. It was a sea of oversized trucks and SUVs. Each one parked over the white lines like a defiant statement of personal territory. I circled the level once, then twice just in case. The frustration was familiar. It created a dull and throbbing headache behind my eyes. This was just like the shopping cart lot. All of this a different flavor of the same pointless task.

Before I continued to the next level the Geo Tracker caught something and violently jerked itself towards what I hit. I frantically got out to see what it was and the shock on my face quickly turned to irritation. A hitch on the back of a truck sticking nearly half way out into the driving path. I somehow missed it the first time around. I kicked at it and just got back into my vehicle. Feeling nearly defeated I lowered my head onto the steering wheel to take a breather. But when I looked up I saw it. On the far end of the level tucked between a Tahoe and a pillar was a single empty rectangle of painted lines. A perfect spot. The hope inside had flexed. I drove toward it.

As I got closer the smile on my face turned into a look of confusion. Sitting right in the middle of the beautiful empty spot, was a single, lonely shopping cart.

It was one of my carts.

I stopped the car. A signature move from the architect of my misery. I could feel Satan's laughter in the humming of the lights. I could get angry. I could curse the cart, the spot, and the entire system. But I had learned something on the escalator and in this place. Anger was a fuel they wanted you to burn.

I put the car in park, got out, and walked to the cart. I gripped its cold familiar handle. I did not slam it into the pillar. I did not kick it. I pushed it, calmly and methodically, all the way to the nearest collection corral of my mind. As long as it wasn’t in my spot, I didn’t care where the cart would go. I let go and watched the cart take off down the ramp of the parking garage and turned quickly to not take responsibility for whatever it may hit.

I walked back to my car, got in, and parked without incident. The moment the engine shut off the world dissolved again.

This time the air was filled with the harsh buzzing light of a supermarket. I stood before a single solitary self checkout machine. A conveyor belt held a week's worth of groceries. There was milk, bread, a bag of avocados, a frozen pizza, a single crumpled coupon for fifty cents off yogurt. The list went on.

""Circle Three,"" Satan's voice announced, now sounding like he was enjoying himself immensely. ""The Self Checkout Aisle of Technological Despair. Complete your order. And try not to break anything.""

I picked up the first item. A carton of milk. I scanned it. Beep. I placed it in the bagging area.

""Unexpected item in the bagging area,"" the machine's cheerful and robotic voice chirped.

I removed the milk. I scanned it again. Beep. I placed it gently in the bag.

""Unexpected item in the bagging area.""

I looked at the bagging area on my right. I saw the flashing red light. I took a deep breath. I lifted the milk and set it down again. Harder this time.

""Unexpected item in the bagging area. Please wait for assistance.""

A small light on top of the machine began to flash. A moment later a demon in a blue vest materialized beside me. It was Barry, looking even more weary than before.

""Problem?"" he sighed.

""The scale,"" I said, keeping my voice even. ""It's not reading the item.""

""Did you try turning it off and on again?"" he asked, not looking at me.

""It's a scale,"" I said.

He sighed again. He pulled out a device and tapped a sequence of buttons on his screen, and vanished. I figured he must’ve done something at least. So I tried again. This time the milk scanned and i was given acknowledgment through the screen in front of me. I moved on to the bread. Then the cereal. Then the can of soup. Each item was a small victory. But each item had their own difficulty scanning. Some barcodes too faded or ripped, leaving me to manually enter them on the screen that had a mind of its own.

I finally got to the crumpled coupon. I held its barcode to the scanner. Nothing happened. I smoothed it out against the conveyor belt. Nothing. I tried entering the code manually.

""Invalid coupon,"" the machine declared.

I could feel the anger rising again. I wanted to pick up the can of soup and hurl it through the scanner screen. But I didn't. I was a professional now. I simply placed the useless coupon on the register and left it there. A small white flag of surrender. I paid for my groceries with a card that materialized in my hand, gathered my bags, and waited.

The world shimmered and I was back in the waiting room. The sign now read: ""CIRCLE TWO AND THREE: COMPLETE."" Barry gave me another nod. This one seemed to carry genuine sympathy. He knew what I had just endured. I had passed another test. The gauntlet was wearing me down but I was still standing.

Chapter Four

The waiting room dissolved not into the familiar soul crushing landscape of corporate purgatory. I was standing in the entrance to a vast, open plan office. The air was thick with the low electric hum of computers and the scent of stale coffee. The space was a sea of identical grey cubicles.  Stretching far out to a horizon of flickering fluorescent lights.

""Circle Four,"" Satan's voice echoed through the cavernous room. ""The Open Plan Office of Sensory Assault. Your task is simple. Sit at your designated terminal and complete the data entry assignment on the screen. You are not allowed to leave your cubicle for any reason.""

I found my station. A grey desk, a grey chair, and a glowing monitor displaying a spreadsheet filled with nonsensical numbers. My task was to transpose them from one column to another. work designed to melt the brain. I had just started typing when the assault began.

It started with a sound. A rhythmic clicking snip-snip-snip from the cubicle to my right. I risked a glance. A demon in a short sleeved shirt was casually clipping his fingernails over his keyboard. Sending tiny yellowed shards flying onto the floor. I turned back to my screen, focusing on the numbers. Snip-snip-snip. My blood grew hot.

Then came the smell. An invisible wave of odor. Very warm and very fishy. It rolled in from the direction of the breakroom. Someone was microwaving salmon for lunch. At 9:30 in the morning. The smell was so potent I could almost taste it. It clung to the back of my throat making it hard to breathe. My fingers slipped on the keys.

""Alright team, let's circle back and touch base.""

A new demon, this one in a slightly nicer suit, was walking through the aisles. He must’ve been the floor manager. He stopped by my cubicle and peered at my screen.

""Hey Gary, just wanted to check in and make sure we're all on the same page moving forward,"" he said, using a string of words that meant nothing at all. ""Let's leverage our core competencies to really synergize this workflow. We need to be proactive, not reactive. Let's touch base again after lunch to circle back on our action items.""

He clapped me on the shoulder, a gesture that was both familiar and deeply unsettling, and moved on. The nail clipping started again. The fish smell seemed to intensify. The hum of the fluorescent lights began to sound like a swarm of angry insects. The numbers on my screen swam before my eyes. This was not a single annoyance. It was a symphony of them all playing at once. And more came. To my left, the cubicle owner came back in from break, “Can’t believe it rained today.” I could smell him, and all the residue of cigarette smoke that mixed into his clothing from the wet outside air. And all the telephones ringing, never ending. I never picked up mine. But Sharron did, and she had a lot to say loudly. Then a power surge came through. None of my work was saved.

I closed my eyes. I pictured the escalator. I pictured the parking lot. I pictured the endless, pointless wind. This was the same. It was just noise. It was just a different kind of cart to be gathered. The power restored and I took a deep fish and cigarette scented breath and went back to my typing. I did not look up again. I did not react. I just typed.

I was nearly finished when the manager came back out onto the floor. “Alright everybody, let’s do this team workshop meeting.” I frantically typed and entered numbers. The lights dimmed a bit quickly catching my attention and I knew another power surge was imminent. “Let’s go Gary.” I took a quick glance at the manager and back to my screen. He Looked impatient. The fluorescent lighting started going out further down the office and started traveling in my direction. I could hear the electrical hums fizzing out as computers turned off with the lights above them. I wouldn’t spend another minute in this office. When the last number was entered, the world dissolved.

I was now standing in a quiet, dimly lit restaurant. A single table was set for two. A woman was already sitting there looking at the menu with an expression of intense concentration.

""Circle Five,"" Satan's voice announced, now with a theatrical flair. ""The Dinner Table of Dietary Inquisition. Your task is to enjoy a three course meal with your dining companion. Bon appétit.""

The evening was a masterclass in misery. For the appetizer she ordered the tomato soup, then sent it back because it was ""too soupy."" For the main course she ordered the steak well done. When it arrived she cut into it. She declared it ""a little pink for well done,"" and sent it back to be cooked again. While we waited she took out her phone and began showing me photos of her cat. Each one accompanied by a detailed backstory. The second steak arrived grey and tough as leather. She cut it, chewed a single piece, and declared it acceptable.

I ate my own meal in silence. The food tasting like ash in my mouth. For dessert she ordered the chocolate lava cake. When it arrived she spent the next fifteen minutes taking pictures of it from every conceivable angle. Adjusting the lighting with her phone's flash. She even got up to get a better angle from above, all while my melted ice cream formed a puddle on my plate. I never complained. I never sighed. I just nodded and smiled. I was the perfect dining companion.

She kept talking about how unsatisfied she was with the food and how the server was terrible at her job. When we were finished and the server came back with the bill, things escalated. My terrible date requested the manager. The server pleaded that he was out and she could help instead. My date wouldn’t take that for an answer and started to verbally assault the server.

The server stepped back and mumbled, “I’ll actually go get my manager.”

My date looked at me, her eyes on fire with rage and delight. I looked back and watched the server talk to a demon in uniform so tall his head touched the ceiling. I quickly turned back to my date, “I got a better idea.” I held out my hand and gestured for her to grab it. Once she grabbed my hand I quickly got up and bolted to the entrance of the restaurant. I held her hand tightly.

Immediately when my foot touched outside I was back in the waiting room. The sign now read: ""CIRCLES FOUR AND FIVE: COMPLETE."" Barry looked up from his ficus giving me a slow weary salute and went back to his watering. I was halfway through the gauntlet. This was starting to feel routine. I can do this.

Chapter Five

The familiar beige of the waiting room faded again. This time it was replaced by the scent of artificial butter and sticky floors. I was standing inside the entrance to a grand movie theatre. But it felt wrong. The velvet ropes were frayed, the carpet was a maze of dated patterns, and the air tasted stale.

""Circle Six,"" Satan's voice boomed through the empty lobby now with the dramatic flair of a movie trailer narrator. ""The Movie Theater of Disrespect. The film is about to start. Enjoy the show.""

I walked around to find only one auditorium that had a display sign for a movie. Upon entering, it was packed and very dark. I found my seat. A perfectly centered spot about halfway back. The only seat available and it was wet in some spots and broken. Just as the iconic opening scene of a classic film I vaguely recognized began to flicker to life, I felt it. A sharp rhythmic thump against the back of my chair. I glanced back. A lanky teenager. He noticed me staring and I quickly turned away. The teenager started kicking my chair with the unconscious rhythmic motion of a nervous habit. I tried to focus on the screen.

Then came the light. A few rows down, a woman was holding her phone up, the brightness turned all the way up, scrolling through social media. The blue white glow was a beacon of distraction in the dark theater pulling my eyes away from the film again and again.

But the worst was the sound. A group of people a few rows down were not watching the movie. They were having a loud and animated conversation about their cousin's baby shower.

I could feel the anger. A hot prickling sensation under my skin. I wanted to turn around and shout. I wanted to snatch the phone and hurl it into the aisle. I wanted to stand up and tell them to shut up. But I didn't. I had learned my lesson. I closed my eyes. I focused on the sound of the film, the dialogue, the musical score. I let the kicking become a background drumbeat. I let the glowing phone be a distant star. I let the conversation be the wind. I just watched the movie.

Then the baby came. It cried and cried. A man several seats over from me took hours to open a pack of candy. Twisting and pulling the plastic making the crinkle noise drown out everything else. People were getting up and moving around. Popcorn rained down on me from nowhere and a man a few rows behind me developed a cough one would need to go to the doctor’s office for.

When the credits finally rolled, the world dissolved.

I was now standing on a bustling city sidewalk. The sun beating down. The air filled with the cacophony of traffic, music, and a thousand overlapping conversations. This was different. This was chaos in motion.

""Circle Seven,"" Satan's voice declared, now sounding like a stressed out city planner. ""The Gauntlet of Spatial Unawareness. Your destination is the coffee shop at the end of the third block. Do not touch anyone.""

I started walking. The first challenge came immediately. A group of friends all elbow locked bustled toward me. All standing side by side staring at me as if me standing there was an inconvenience for them. They were not going to break their formation. I ducked towards the road narrowly avoiding oncoming vehicles. “Watch where you’re goin’,” one of them barked back at me. I steadied myself and kept walking down the side walk.

I navigated the human tide of onlookers who couldn’t watch where they were going. One guy on a bike just assumed i knew he was coming up from behind me. Eventually I walked into a plaza. A family of five, spread out like a human net, was moving at a glacial pace, looking up at the buildings with wide eyed wonder. Every attempt I made to pass them meant they changed course to the direction I was going. A man in a fanny pack was walking backwards. He was taking a video of everything, completely oblivious to the fact that I was directly in his path. I dodged and weaved.

Finally, I was coming up on the end of the third block. The tall buildings vanished. The people surrounding me blurred away into nothingness. But my path was still there in front of me with the coffee shop now in sight. With each step I took, more of the city disappeared and in its place pieces of what looked to be like shelves came into existence beside me. A ceiling with buzzing overhead lighting creeped down above. When I was forced to stop walking I realized I was inside a grocery store again. The path was now a grocery aisle. Two women had stopped their carts dead in the center of it, standing nose-to-nose talking to each other. I had to stop walking. Their carts formed a perfect impassable wall. I stood there staring at them. I thought to myself how it was possible that they couldn’t see me. I looked back down the aisle assuming there might be another way around. Just darkness and a line of people had formed behind me anyways. I turned to face the two women and I cleared my throat. Nothing. I waited a full minute. Then I cleared my throat again but a little louder this time.

One of them turned and glared at me as if I had just asked to borrow her kidney. “Can’t you see we’re trying to have a conversation?” I gestured to the hoard of people behind me who, like me, were also trying to get by. Begrudgingly she moved her cart an inch and immediately went back to talking to the other woman. I squeezed through the gap and walked the last ten feet to the door of the coffee shop.

The world shimmered, and I was back in the waiting room. The sign now read: ""CIRCLES SIX AND SEVEN: COMPLETE."" Barry looked up from his ficus plant. He gave me a single slow nod, and went back to his work. Only two circles remained. The end was in sight.

Chapter Six

The beige waiting room melted away. This time reforming into the small familiar entryway of my own house. The scent of pine cleaner and roast turkey hung in the air. Muffled voices, cheerful and sharp, drifted from the dining room. This was the eighth circle. I could feel it. This one felt personal.

""Circle Eight,"" Satan's voice whispered, sounding positively gleeful. ""The Festive Dinner of Unwelcome Intrusions. Go on. Your family is waiting.""

I took a deep breath and walked into the dining room. The table was set with my wife's good china. A perfectly roasted turkey sat steaming in the center. And there they were. My in-laws. My father-in-law, a man whose face was permanently set to disappointed. He was already carving the turkey. My mother-in-law was rearranging the cranberry sauce on its serving dish. This is Hell. 

""Gary, there you are,"" my father-in-law said, not looking up from the bird. ""You're late. Did you see what those people in city council are trying to do with the zoning laws? It's a disgrace. Handing over the neighborhood to the... well, you know.""

My test began. ""Oh really,"" I said, my voice a masterclass in non committal neutrality as I took my seat. ""I haven't been following the news.""

""Everyone's a victim these days,"" my mother-in-law chimed in, her voice dripping with syrupy condescension. ""No one wants to work for anything anymore.""

I passed the potatoes. I smiled. I was a fortress of polite deflection.

DING DONG.

The doorbell rang. Jarring and loud in the small dining room.

""Are you expecting someone?"" my mother-in-law asked, her tone instantly suspicious.

""No,"" I said, getting up. ""I'll get it.""

I opened the door to a young man with a blindingly white smile and a clipboard. ""Good evening, sir! Do you have five minutes to hear how you can save thousands on your energy bills with solar?""

""Not now,"" I said, trying to close the door. He wedged his foot in the doorjamb.

""It's a zero down financing opportunity!"" he chirped.

I finally pushed the door shut and returned to the table. The conversation had moved on to a new, even more offensive topic involving immigration statistics that were clearly made up. I had just managed to serve myself a slice of turkey when the doorbell rang again.

This time, it was a woman in a modest dress holding a pamphlet. ""Hello! I was just in the neighborhood and felt the spirit move me to ask if you have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal lord and savior?""

""I'm busy,"" I said, my voice tight. I closed the door. My father-in-law was now loudly complaining about the war on Christmas.

The doorbell became a relentless metronomic torture. A pair of teenagers trying to sell magazine subscriptions. A child raising money for a school trip. Another solar panel salesman from a different but more aggressive company. Each time I had to excuse myself from the politically charged dinner table, paste on a polite smile, and fend off the intruder. Each time I returned, the racial and political tension at the table had ratcheted up another notch. My turkey was now cold. My potatoes were congealing.

Finally, after the fifth interruption, I sat back down. My mother-in-law looked at me. ""You know, Gary, if you just made more money, we wouldn't have to live in a neighborhood where they come to the door.""

I opened my mouth to reply, but I stopped myself. To avoid failing, I’ve held back everything so far. I couldn’t break now. I closed my eyes tight, and then opened them.

I was back in the waiting room. The air was cold. The fluorescent lights hummed their mournful tune. A ticket was in my hand. There was a number on it that read 8,888,888,888-B. I remember this ticket. I’ve held one previously before, when I first arrived in hell. The sign above the counter read: ""ADJUDICATIONS - PLEASE WAIT TO BE CALLED."" And Barry, looking more ancient and tired than ever, was slowly yet deliberately watering a drooping ficus plant.

""Circle Nine,"" Satan's voice was now a soft weary sigh. ""The Final Circle. The Waiting Room of Forever Waiting. Your task is to wait. For your number to be called. Without complaint. Without despair. Without getting up.""

I sat down. I looked at my number. I looked at the sign, which currently read: ""NOW SERVING: 1."" A clock on the wall started ticking, but the second hand was moving backward. I looked at Barry. He looked at me. There was no malice in his eyes. Only a shared understanding. I leaned back in the uncomfortable plastic chair. I closed my eyes. I had learned the ultimate lesson of hell. It wasn't the carts. It wasn't the wind. It wasn't the door to door salesmen or the racist in-laws. It was the wait. The endless, pointless, bureaucratic wait. And I was finally, truly, at peace. And for the first time in Hell, I went to sleep.

Chapter Seven

I woke up in a cold sweat. I do not know how long I sat sleeping in that chair. The clock on the wall continued its slow mocking journey backward. The number on the sign remained a defiant ""1."" I had transcended anger, passed through frustration, and arrived at a state of pure, empty calm. I was a being made of beige patience and fluorescent light. I was waiting.

And then, it happened.

A soft DING echoed through the room. The flickering sign above the counter changed. ""NOW SERVING: 8,888,888,888-B.""

It was my number.

I rose from the plastic chair and walked to the counter. Each step a quiet affirmation of my victory. Barry looked up from his ficus with a single, almost imperceptible smile touching his lips. He gestured toward the black door at the end of the hall. The one I had entered what felt like a lifetime ago.

I followed the hall. I pushed the door open and stepped back into Satan's office. He was standing by the window looking out at the sea of clouds under the blood red sky. He turned as I entered. A slow genuine smile spreading across his face.

""Gary,"" he said, his voice filled with something that sounded remarkably like respect. ""I am... impressed. Truly. No one has ever made it through the final waiting room without trying to strangle Barry with his own ficus plant. You have a profound, dare I say, almost pathological capacity for tolerating nonsense.""

He walked around his desk and sat down. ""A deal is a deal. You beat the Gauntlet of Minor Annoyances. You have earned your reward. A more suitable position.""

My dead heart gave a familiar weary thud. I braced myself for another clever torment.

""Follow me,"" Satan said now standing and walking toward a door I had not noticed before.

He led me out of his office and down a short plain hallway. He stopped at a simple gray door with a small window in it. Through the window I could see a vast silent room filled with hundreds of identical gray cubicles. The only sound was a faint, rhythmic thump... scrape... thump... scrape.

""Behold,"" Satan said with pride, ""the Help Desk for the Damned.""

I looked inside confused. Cubicles, an infinite amount, a demon in each one. ""What do they do?""

""They're the first line of defense,"" Satan explained. ""When a newly arrived soul has a problem with their torment. Be it a pitchfork is the wrong temperature or their fire isn't hot enough. Maybe their screaming roommate is too loud. They call here. And my staff,"" he gestured vaguely to the room of miserable-looking demons, ""is supposed to help them. Frankly, they're useless. They have no empathy. They're demons for hell's sake.""

Satan turned to me, his eyes gleaming. ""But you. You're different. You've just completed the Gauntlet. You understand. You know the nuances of annoyance. You've walked a mile in their inconveniently parked shoes. I'm promoting you. You're the new Floor Supervisor.""

My heart sank. ""My job is to... supervise them?""

""No,"" Satan said grinning. ""Your job is to train them. Your first case is in there waiting right now.""

He pushed me through the door. A small partitioned desk was waiting for me equipped with a headset. Sitting on the other side of the desk was a hulking demon named Gorgoth. He was trying to sharpen a long crooked knife on a stapler.

""Gorgoth here is our newest hire,"" Satan said. ""He's a bit rough around the edges. Your job is to teach him how to handle a customer service call with empathy and efficiency. Let's listen in on your first training module.""

Before I could protest Satan placed the headset on my head and clicked a button. A voice, panicked and whiny, crackled through the speaker.

""Hello? Yes, I just got here and well, my eternal torment is supposed to be being forced to listen to Nickelback on a loop, right? But it's the live version. From 'The State' tour. The sound quality is just awful! Can you switch me to the studio version? Please?""

I closed my eyes. I could feel Gorgoth's hot rancid breath on my neck.

Gorgoth leaned into the microphone, his voice a gravelly roar. ""CEASE YOUR WHINING, MORTAL! YOUR EARS SHALL BLEED AND YOU SHALL ENJOY IT!""

""No, no, no!"" I hissed, snatching the mic. I turned to the demon. ""Okay, Gorgoth, first rule. We don't tell them to enjoy it. We validate their frustration. It makes them more compliant.""

I clicked the mic back on and adopted a tone of weary practiced sympathy. ""Yes, sir. I understand completely. The live version has a very different energy, and frankly, the mixing is just not there. I'm putting in a priority ticket to have you transferred to the 'Silver Side Up' cycle. Can I do anything else for you today?""

I looked at Gorgoth who was staring at me with a look of profound demonic confusion.

""See?"" I said, the life draining from my eyes. ""You kill them with kindness. It's much more efficient in the long run.""

Satan patted me on the shoulder from the doorway. ""You're a natural, Gary. Keep up the good work.""

I looked at the endless sea of cubicles filled with untrained demons. The hulking clueless demon breathing awkwardly beside me brought me back into focus. I look back at him and noticed the blinking light of the next incoming call. I had conquered hell itself only to be put in charge of customer service. I was no longer just a sinner in hell. I was a manager.

1pv0r8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pv0r8f/fellow_crimmus_ruiner/,fellow Crimmus ruiner!,"Hi all! Long-time reader, first-time poster. I want to thank everyone for being so vulnerable, funny, supportive, and snarky on this forum. It has given me a lot of strength and energy over the past several months while I started my recovery from a narcissistic family dynamic. I know this will be a life-long process, with peaks and valleys. For reference, I am a 38-year-old woman, married, no kids, social worker (something else my MAGA mom hates!), living on the West Coast for the past almost eleven years. Everyone in my family of origin live on the East Coast. My parents have visited me a total of 2 times over the past almost eleven years, and my sister and brother-in-law maybe 4. Guess who is always spending their money and vacation time to have ""family time""? I have a wonderful therapist, and am practicing the ""taking up space"" thing here. :)

The world has always revolved around my mother. Her father died when she was young and she always reported how she felt like she was born to the wrong family. I wasn't there, I can't confirm whether she experienced emotional abuse or not, but the lore that I was brought up with was that my grandmother and aunt were horrible to her. My father is an absolute control freak. His parents split when he was young and my grandmother once told me that ""he always needed someone to take care of, and \[my\] mom was the perfect candidate."" I was raised with my parents' relationship being set as the absolute highest soulmate standard to achieve, and as an adult I have realized so. much. crazy. shit. about their dynamic. My mother has always told me that I am ""\[her\] mirror,"" that I am basically the only person who understands her and her ""quirks."" My father has used claims of him being able to connect with ""the other side"" and ""knowing things"" as a control tactic since I was young. My parents call his otherworldly connection ""The Night People"" and they are not to be discounted. I wonder if The Night People are okay with his longstanding sexual inappropriateness towards me and his instance of physical abuse towards my sister, both of which he flatout denies, if not undercuts the severity and traumatic nature of.

My sister and I were always told by our father growing up to ""not bother Mom"" (she never worked, and was an aspiring writer, until she mysteriously gave it up when I was in my late teens because ""no one understood \[her\]"" and wouldn't make her famous and rich) and to come to him with any ""issues."" God forbid I have any needs or desires or wishes that would tip my mother over the edge. Asking to not have M&Ms for an after-school snack because they made me itchy and I wanted an orange? Wanting to take cello lessons? Having a friend over after school? Being shown how to use a tampon? Forget it! I was also always accused of ""wanting a parade"" for my birthday, let alone have any special recognition for any big milestone like entering my teens or graduating from high school, although she would - and does - brag brag brag about my accomplishments to anyone who would listen. Of course, the common refrain was that women were always jealous of her, that's why none of the other mothers at the school got along with her. My mother had exactly one friend when I was a child, the mother of a good friend of mine, and their friendship mysteriously shriveled up and died after the friend renovated their house and bought a convertible. From a young age, I was acutely aware of my parents' financial issues and my mother's angst about the house that we lived in. There was always anxiety about whether or not we were going to move, with For Sale signs coming up and down from the lawn every few months. I never invited friends over, mostly because I was embarrassed about my mother and because there was no room for us to do anything. Despite the stories of my mother's upbringing, my maternal grandmother and aunt were always involved in our lives from the time I was born until I was 16, when my mother went no-contact with them. My aunt in particular was always a refuge for me and my sister. I never got to say goodbye to my grandmother, who died in 2012, which haunts me. I have since gotten back in touch with my aunt. :)

When my mother was going through menopause, I was in my early 20s and starting my first career. I came home to help caretake one day, because my father didn't like to leave her home alone. Later that evening, my mother had an inexplicable meltdown, telling me about her aborted plan to commit s\*icide at a nearby hotel in order for my sister and I to get life insurance money to help with our student loan debts (we are both first-generation college students who went to private colleges, and never received any type of financial acumen from our parents - the private colleges, especially mine - a borderline Ivy, were feathers in my mother's cap that she loved, and continues to love, to brag about). My father was sitting on the couch, unresponsive. Both begged me to never tell my sister.

My parents ultimately ""lost"" (abandoned) my childhood home to the bank in 2015 (I didn't get to say a proper goodbye to it until last year, when my husband and I drove past it on the way to a large family gathering) and moved a state away from my father's job. My father called me a few months later to ""talk down"" my mother, who was having a meltdown over having made ""the wrong choice"" about their new house, which was filled with cockroaches. When I took off from work to visit them and help with finding a new place, my father made a horrible anti-Semitic remark about the realtor who kept calling him, which I got upset about because I have a Jewish husband and mother-in-law, not to mention many Jewish friends. He never apologized, even after I explained why his comment upset me. My mother then came into the room, hysterical, saying that my father said that because he was ""exhausted"" and ""stressed"" and that the realtor ""was going to kill \[her\] with all of the phone calls."" It didn't occur to me at the time to inquire why they didn't just ask the realtor to... stop calling?

This past summer, I visited my parents for a week without my husband. We had been going through a rough patch, and I thought some parental nurturing would be helpful. Hah! My mother loved this, of course - my oversharing at the time was just the ammo she needed to continue to brainwash me into believing that she and my father know what's best for me (cue The Night People), that I need to leave him and move back to the East Coast, preferably within driving distance of them. When I flew in, my parents told me that my sister was coming into town by train the next afternoon: would I be open to driving with my mom to the train station (btw, my mother hasn't driven in almost 18 years - couldn't tell you why, she's perfectly healthy) around noon the next day to pick her up? Of course.

In my jet-lagged haze, I woke up the next day around 11:30am, in a bit of a panic, knowing that my mother and I would have to leave for the train station soon. Imagine my surprise when I went downstairs to see my mother, that she was nowhere to be found! I went outside and saw her sitting in the driver's seat of the car. I yelled ""Mom! Mom!"" and knocked on the window, and she ignored me. After a few seconds, she turned, and told me that she was going to drive to the train station because I had slept in. What?! I told her to not do that, to get out of the car, and to let me drive. After some passive-aggressive hemming and hawing, she ultimately relented, and for about the next 30 minutes as I drove on the highway, had to listen to her say that I (me) needed coffee, although I was perfectly fine, albeit grumpy. I asked her why she didn't just wake me up, to which she had no response. I told her, ""Mom, if something had happened to you, I never would have heard them end of it."" That shut her up nicely. I recounted the scenario to my sister the next day, who told me that our mother told her about it and that she had apologized. LOL.

There is classic triangulation and sister wound, by the way, in case you couldn't tell. :D

Christmas has always been hellacious, although as a child it was masqueraded as this beautiful, magical time. I always wondered why none of my friends' families - or even my cousins - didn't also open a mountain of gifts for up to 16 hours between four people, sequestered inside the house, not seeing family or friends, often receiving total garbage that wasn't requested, watching A Christmas Story on an endless loop in the background competing with The Chieftains blasting on a stereo (we're not even Irish), being absolutely physically and emotionally drained by the end. I have been experiencing chronic pain for the past six months, for which I am under a doctor's great care and that my mother is aware of. Despite this, my husband and I booked tickets for Christmas in late October. I have been in therapy for quite some time, and when my therapist reframed my lack of desire to go to Christmas anymore as a choice that I could make, my world blew right open. For reference, my husband's father passed away on 12/27/2020 after a long illness, so Christmas for us since that year has always been a somber recollection of a traumatic hospice experience. When I told my mother this in 2021, she responded, ""Well, my father was dying around Christmas, too, and you don't see me making a big deal about it."" My mother has confided in me about a lot of contempt and jealousy that she feels towards my husband and mother-in-law, both of whom I have the most healing and beautiful relationships with, although she'll love-bomb my husband to his face then talk shit about him behind his back, just as she does with me, my father, and sister. She's in disbelief that I have friends as an adult, because as she likes to recount, I was ""a freak"" in high school.

Earlier this month, I called my mother to tell her that my chronic pain had flared and that I didn't think it would be a good idea for me to fly in a middle seat for 6+ hours this year. She was shocked. She said ""Well, you're gonna do what you're gonna do,"" refused to accommodate my request to figure out logistics for gifts and a Zoom Christmas, then sent me a very long text about five hours later (\~11pm her time) that told me that she and my father were sitting in silence, shocked; that my sister called her crying (I had talked to her after I called my mother; my sister reported being sad but understanding); asking me if I was sure that I didn't want to come; encouraging me to let her know if there was some other reason; offering to upgrade us to First Class for my comfort. I used my BIFF skills, and of course this wasn't good enough. Cue about a week of silent treatment, ended by a phone call in the middle of a workday. I always put my personal phone on Do Not Disturb, as I have a very busy day job, which almost anyone who actually calls me on a regular basis would know (guess who is always initiating texts and phone calls?). Her 1.5-minute long voicemail was certifiable. Her passive-aggressiveness, off the charts. ""Your phone went straight to voicemail, I don't know what that's about."" ""I don't know what's going on with you."" ""I guess you'll call me back when you want to.""

I told her recently that my husband and I could do a Zoom gathering for an hour. She countered via text that an hour ""wasn't much time,"" asked again if there was another reason for us not coming, including if we were ""annoyed"" by them (but ""didn't want to make a federal case out of it""), and asking if we should unwrap gifts together or separately. That was four days ago, and my husband and I decided to not respond. It's just not worth the time. We'll join the Zoom link at the time we offered tomorrow, and see what happens.

The relationship is built on power dynamics, restraint, and trust, with heat woven throughout the story rather than saved for the end. Dark-romance adjacent in tone, but grounded in clear, intentional consent and emotional realism. One-on-one romance only; no love triangles, no reverse harem.

**Short Excerpt:**

The bell over the door jingled as they stepped inside, a wash of warm air carrying the scent of fried onions and fresh coffee. Vivienne hesitated, hugging her coat closer, but Christopher didn’t miss a beat. He nodded at the hostess like he’d been there a hundred times—which, apparently, he had—and steered her toward a booth in the corner.

“You trust me?” he asked, sliding into his side of the booth.

She arched a brow. “That depends.”

“On?”

“On what you’re asking me to trust you with.”

“Dinner,” he said simply. “That’s all.”

When the waitress came over, pad in hand, he didn’t hesitate. “The lady will have the patty melt, extra pickles, curly fries instead of regular. And she’ll need a chocolate shake—trust me.” Then he looked up at Vivienne, almost daring her to contradict him.

**Content Warnings:**

This manuscript contains explicit, open-door sexual content, dominance themes, and adult language. All sexual interactions are fully consensual. No sexual violence, no non-consent, no love triangles.

**Type of feedback requested:**

I’m looking for **reader-experience feedback**, not line edits. In particular:

* Emotional engagement and chemistry
* Pacing and escalation into the first explicit scene
* Whether the buildup makes the payoff feel earned
* Any moments that pulled you out or felt unintentionally off

Grammar or wording notes aren’t needed unless something caused confusion though you are welcome to share any you come across.

**Timeline**

Ideal feedback window is **3–4 weeks for the full manuscript**.

Because pacing matters, the beta will be shared in **stages**:

* Chapters 1–5 first
* Chapters 6–7 (first explicit scene) next
* Remaining chapters shared after initial feedback/interest

Beta links will be shared privately through StoryOrigin after initial contact. This is a standard beta/ARC platform and is free to readers.

**Critique Swap**

I’m open to critique swaps for contemporary romance or adjacent genres with adult characters. High-heat content is fine.

**Interested?**

If this sounds like your kind of read, please comment or DM with:

* A sentence about your romance reading preferences
* Confirmation you’re comfortable with explicit content

Thanks so much!

We met for the rescheduled date and it went really well: lots of laughing/giggling, deep conversation (she initiated past relationships talk, repeatedly said “if I had a boyfriend…” stuff, called herself traditional, offered to cook Korean food for me). Flirty moments (let me get close for her to smell my perfume, giggled when I paid for our coffee) She asked about my faith (I’m Muslim) and said she didn’t mind. Ended with mutual “I had a really good time!!”

Post date she texted cute random stuff late at night (shared photos/stories) and also texted first from her Christmas trip. 

Then replies got short, no questions back, and full silence for over a week now (last message was a polite but low effort reply to a playful joke I made) I also didn’t reach out to her in a week but as she didn’t ask questions back I don’t want to always carry the conversation . 

I’m confused because the interest seemed genuine and strong. I’m good looking (get stares, etc.), treated her well, no red flags from me after the early mistake.

Why the sudden fade? Was the initial interest real or just post date high? Or maybe the trip + time apart just killing momentum?

I should probably start by saying that this is my first time ever posting something like this, so please bear with me. I’m not even sure this is the right place to post, and this will likely turn into a long rant.



So, i'm a 28 yo man, and about six months ago I broke up with my now ex-girlfriend (29F) of two years. I was actually planning on proposing to her this winter. To make things even more complicated, we still work at the same company. Saying the breakup was hard doesn’t even begin to cover it, but this will be relevant later, so I’ll leave it there for now.

The six months that followed were brutal. I lost interest in everything I used to enjoy, drowned my emotions in food, gained a lot of weight, and barely slept, maybe two hours a night on average. It was rough.

Eventually, things started to improve, or at least I thought they were. I felt like I was finally healing.

I began spending more time with my team at work. We’d have lunch together, take breaks, and just hang out more as a group. Within this team, there was one girl who stood out. She wasn’t my usual type, and at first I didn’t even find her particularly attractive (not saying she wasn't beautiful), but there was something different about her. Her energy felt different.

Let’s call her Julia.

Julia and I started talking casually, with no expectations or hidden intentions. We’d have lunch together, tease each other, share inside jokes. She laughed at my terrible, and I mean \*terrible\* jokes. She’d ask what I was ordering and I’d order for her. She started coming by my desk to smell my perfumes, sometimes spraying some on herself. I’d always tell her when I got a new one. She’d ask me to open the caps of her drinks when she couldn’t. Our eyes would meet across the office and we’d smile at each other. She’d make heart shapes with her hands in my direction. I’d help her with work when she needed it. I genuinely thought we were building a solid friendship.

Somewhere along the way, I started developing a crush on her. A big one. I don’t think I made it obvious, but I knew it wasn’t a good idea. I told myself I wouldn’t act on it, but I couldn’t stop how I felt, and we started talking more and more.

One day, Julia wasn’t feeling well and ended up getting sick. The next day, I brought her some chocolate. She thought it was sweet and appreciated the gesture.

What I didn’t account for was the fact that I still work with my ex. She saw all of this and started telling people there was something going on between Julia and me. They weren’t close, but they got along and sat next to each other in our open-space office.

Julia eventually heard the gossip and confronted me about it, asking if I knew anything, which I didn’t. I apologized for what she’d been put through and told her I’d understand if she wanted some distance. She dismissed that almost immediately.

At the same time, Julia was having a hard time at work. Despite her efforts, she wasn’t meeting her deadlines and was even considering quitting. We made a deal: if she stuck it out a bit longer, I’d take her out for sushi. She agreed, and we sealed it with a pinky promise.

When the day of our unofficial date came, I had shaved, showered, and was getting ready when she texted me saying she had to cancel because her sister, who lives abroad, had come to visit. She asked if we could reschedule. I was disappointed because I’d been looking forward to it, but I told her it was completely fine and that we could do it another time.

A couple of weeks later, things were still going well. Julia had changed departments, but we stayed in close contact. Since her birthday was coming up, I decided to properly invite her out to dinner. This happened while we were having lunch with a colleague, let’s call her Cynthia. I also mentioned that Cynthia was welcome to join us if she wanted. I didn’t want to make things awkward, and since Julia and Cynthia were close, I thought it might ease the situation.

Cynthia looked at Julia with a knowing smile and said, “I mean, you’re the one he’s asking out.” That kind of smile, you know, the one that suggests there might be something more. They both laughed, and Julia accepted the invitation.

We planned to go out the following Friday, right after work. I made reservations at a new, upscale restaurant that I knew she’d like, it fit her vibe perfectly. I also got her a gift. She loves tea and coffee, so I bought a cute coffee mug with a heart-hands design, the same gesture she often made toward me. It came as a pair, so I kept the other one, thinking we’d match.

Cynthia decided to come along, so after work we headed to the restaurant. Everything was great : the food, the music, the atmosphere. Julia told me I’d really nailed it with the choice. We talked, joked, and laughed all night. It felt easy and natural.

At one point, Julia received a text and showed it to Cynthia, who immediately said, “Oh my god, look at the time : it means he’s thinking about you.” That caught me off guard, but I brushed it off.

Before we left, I gave Julia her gift. She loved it, and her reaction genuinely made me happy.

I paid the bill, and we left. I dropped Cynthia off first, then Julia. We talked and joked a bit more, nothing suggestive, just casual conversation. When I dropped her off, she thanked me again and said she’d had a wonderful time. I asked her to text me when she got home, which she did. We said goodnight, and she asked me to text her when I got home as well.

The next morning, she sent me a picture of the mug filled with coffee, saying she loved it and thanking me again, i sent her a pic of me using mine.

On Sunday, since Julia had only recently moved back to the country, Cynthia took her to another city to explore, something they did most weekends. Coincidentally, I was planning to go to the same city that day to check out a phone store I’d mentioned to Julia. We were supposed to see each other there, but our schedules didn’t line up, and she had an appointment she couldn’t miss. Still, we stayed in touch throughout the day.

Later that evening, I went to the beach to clear my head and picked out a few nice-looking rocks I thought she’d like, she’s into that kind of thing, as well as a seashell she could use to decorate her new apartment. I sent her a picture of the beach but didn’t mention the gift.

Monday is when everything shifted.

Julia came into work visibly upset. When I asked what was wrong, she brushed it off, saying she hadn’t slept well and felt strange because the “energies were shifting.” I told her I’d also slept badly and felt off, which was true, even if I don’t really believe in that sort of thing.

I asked her to come by my desk when she had a moment because I had something for her, I was trying to cheer her up. She stopped by briefly, but I didn’t get the chance to give her the rocks and shell.

After that, we barely spoke. That day turned into a week. Her energy towards me completely changed. She felt distant, avoided eye contact, and when she did look at me, it felt cold. We didn’t hang out. We exchanged maybe four texts all week. Even Cynthia started acting strangely.

It felt like Julia suddenly stopped seeing me altogether, and that hurt more than I expected.

Eventually, I asked her directly if everything was okay between us. She replied, “Why wouldn’t it be?” and asked what I meant. I told her I felt like something had been off since her birthday.

She said she was completely done with the company and relieved it was her last week before going on holiday for Christmas and New Year’s. She asked again what felt off. I told her it probably made sense, that maybe I was just picking up on a weird vibe on my end.

But her messages were short and disengaged. She left me on delivered, then replied the next morning with a dry “Morning, all right, have a good day.” I answered, and she left me on read.

I keep asking myself what I did wrong.

This hurt far more deeply than I expected. It reopened wounds I thought were healing from my breakup. I cried the entire weekend, and I still don’t fully understand why. Why does this hurt so much?

When I talked to a close friend about it, he told me it probably wasn’t about \*her\* specifically. It could have been anyone. He said I was craving attention and affection, and she gave me that. I got attached too quickly, and because I was still healing, the pain felt amplified.

What can I do? What should I do? Please help me understand why this broke me to my core.",1,1766620313.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False

1pv0ihb,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1pv0ihb/remember_the_reddit_coffee_exchange_im_bringing/,Remember the Reddit Coffee Exchange? I'm bringing it back.,"A few years ago, I took part in the Reddit coffee gift exchanges a couple of times. For those who weren't around - it was a yearly thing where coffee nerds would get matched with a stranger somewhere in the world and send each other bags from local roasters. Fresh, whole bean, single origin stuff. People would include handwritten notes, postcards, sometimes local snacks. I still follow a few people on Instagram that I met through those exchanges.

It was genuinely one of my favourite things on the internet. Then it just... stopped. The organisers moved on, the subreddit went quiet, and that was that.

I'm a software engineer, and I've been building a platform to bring it back properly. Monthly exchanges instead of yearly. You can choose national-only if you don't want surprise international postage costs. There's a reputation system so people who ghost get filtered out over time. Badges and achievements for the people who consistently send great stuff.

I'm calling it Coffee Pals (working title, open to suggestions). It's not a subscription service or a business trying to sell you coffee - you buy from your local roaster and send it to another human being. The platform just handles the matching and community stuff.

I'm launching a small beta in January to test everything works before opening it up fully. Looking for people who'd be interested in being part of that first exchange and giving feedback on what works and what doesn't.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, I've got a waitlist at [https://coffeepals.io ](https://coffeepals.io/)\- or just drop a comment if you have questions, memories of the old exchanges, or suggestions for features you'd want to see.

1pv0hka,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pv0hka/the_tube/,The tube,"He was the night custodian at the physics lab, which meant two things. Nobody noticed him, and nobody explained anything to him. He pushed his mop past whiteboards full of equations that looked like angry spiders and emptied trash cans stuffed with coffee cups and printouts labeled DO NOT SHARE.

That was how he met the tube machine.

It looked harmless enough. A long stainless steel cylinder bolted to the floor, faintly humming, like a subway tunnel that had learned to breathe. The physicists called it the Temporal Displacement Conduit, which meant nothing to him. To him it was just the tube.

One night, around 2 a.m., a postdoc named Evan waved him over.

“Hey man,” Evan said. “We need a favor.”

That should have been his cue to keep mopping.

Instead, he stopped.

They told him they needed a live human test. They said all the simulations looked good. They said the risk was minimal. They said it would only be a few seconds. They said he would make history.

They did not say he would never come back.

He stepped into the tube wearing his janitor badge, work boots, and a hoodie with a faded PlayStation logo. There was a bright white flash, a pressure like his ears popping, and then nothing.

When he woke up, the lab was gone.

So was the year.

It was the 2940s. Nobody was very specific about which exact year, because apparently that stopped mattering sometime around the collapse of standardized calendars. What mattered was that Earth still existed, people still existed, and everything he recognized was extinct.

There was no Google. No fast food. No iPhone. No PlayStation 5.

No PlayStation at all.

He learned this slowly, which somehow made it worse.

The future was clean and quiet. Food came from nutrient synthesizers that tasted fine but had no personality. No grease. No mystery. No regret. Transportation was instant. Entertainment was immersive neural experiences that everyone else loved and he hated.

He missed holding a controller. He missed button mash panic. He missed rage quitting. He missed knowing that if he was sad enough, he could drive to a drive through and order something terrible for his body and feel better for twelve minutes.

He told people about 2025. They listened politely, the way you listen to someone describing a dream. They nodded when he explained phones you had to hold. They smiled when he talked about apps. They asked if fast food was a religious ritual.

Eventually, he met Louise.

Louise was a historian. Not the kind who memorized dates, but the kind who studied extinct emotions. Nostalgia. Longing. Anticipation. She was fascinated by him, not because he was from the past, but because he missed it.

Most people in the 2940s did not miss anything. Everything was optimized. Everything was available. Desire had been streamlined.

Louise liked that he wanted things he could not have.

They got married in a small ceremony overlooking a city that floated quietly above the ground. Louise wore simple clothes that adjusted color with her mood. He wore a suit printed by a machine that asked him if he preferred “formal” or “historic.” He chose historic, even though he had no idea what that meant anymore.

Louise loved him. Truly. Patiently. She listened when he talked about pizza places that stayed open too late. She let him describe the joy of a perfectly timed fast food fry. She held his hand when he talked about turning on his PS5 after a long day and knowing exactly what was waiting for him.

At night, while Louise slept, he lay awake and imagined the soft blue glow of a loading screen. He imagined the weight of an iPhone in his hand. He imagined typing questions into Google just to see what would come back.

Sometimes he dreamed of the tube.

In the dream, he was back in the lab. The floor smelled like disinfectant. The mop bucket was right where he left it. Someone was calling his name.

He always woke up before he could answer.

The future had given him everything except the one thing he wanted.

No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

1pv07he,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1pv07he/i_went_to_a_dozen_sacramento_area_coffee_cafes_so/,I went to a dozen Sacramento area coffee cafes so you don't have to...,"...but you'll want to. I'm here in Sac on a family holiday trip, and I've been touring the cafes. Up front, I'll post this disclaimer: I'm fairly deep down the rabbithole of specialty coffee, I've been doing it for over three years, I've got a lot of carefully curated gear, and I've drank a lot of good and bad coffee along the way. I've honed my skills to where I rarely get coffee out that's better than what I can make at home (be it pourover or espresso). Unless a cafe is associated with an outstanding local roaster, I often prefer beans from established domestic or international roasters such as DAK, Sey, Native, La Cabra, and others.

When evaluating a cafe for MY personal tastes (which is what this list is about), my number one criteria is: How good is your espresso? Not latte, not iced coffee, not <some crazy sugar bomb of a drink that is barely coffee adjacent>. Straight espresso, in a little cup, preferably with some sparkling water. Some of the cafes below, I'll be honest, looked at me like I had three heads when I asked for this, and that's always a bad sign. It means they customarily pour the espresso into the above-mentioned drinks where it can hide, not shine.

So, with that, here's my list thus far. I still have two days and a few more places to visit, but this is what I've encountered thus far, in reverse order of preference. Another disclaimer: I really tried to curate this list such that there wouldn't be any absolute stinkers, and to be clear, none of the cafes below were like that. They're all far better than standard mass market big chain cafes.

12. Forever by 18 Grams - This place was one of the ones that looked at me like I had three heads when I asked for espresso. I was offered an Americano, latte etc. but in fairness, when I clarified, I was served an espresso straight up with no water etc. It was a fairly basic house espresso blend that, while still far better than anything one would get at Starbucks or Dutch Bros etc, was not what I'd call specialty coffee.

11. Seasons Coffee Roasters - The cafe itself is quaint and beautiful. The decor is very nice, and the staff are also very nice. But they only serve one bean as espresso, and it was again a very plain cup that really needs milk and sweetener.

10. Pachamama (20th Street)- Some will probably bristle at this local favorite being so far down the list, and while the cafe itself is very nice, the espresso I sampled didn't wow me. It was well made, not bitter or sour, but it just didn't impress. Most of their bagged coffees were from Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, Brazil etc, countries that I don't usually associate with the higher end of specialty coffee (such as Panama, Ethiopia, Colombia, etc). Again, though very nice cafe vibe and experience.

9. Camellia - This cafe had a very cool setup and vibe. It was positively bustling on a Sunday morning, and for good reason: the espresso here was their Ethereal Blend featuring notes of dark chocolate, berries and chewy caramel, and the cup had all of that, getting even better as it cooled. This was actually my first cafe visited among this list, and it was a great start.

8. Milka - Situated in a very classic repurposed home on G Street, the space is warm if sparse, and the staff was very nice. The usual house espresso blend wasn't on the bar for espresso today, but a nice Colombian gave some subtle fruity notes against a background of roastiness. A good but not great cup.

7. Cora - Serving Sey coffee (a NYC based roaster ranked at number 4 on Roastful's Top 50 Roasters in 2024), this place definitely cares about cup quality and their product. Sey roasts fairly light, so the typical 1:2 ratio is usually going to produce a sour cup, so Cora was pulling closer to 1:4 (about 17:70 in the cup I received). It wasn't as strong as a typical espresso as a result, but was fruity and delicious with a lingering pleasant acidity. A nice cup.

6. Immortal - A goth inspired vegan cafe, this one had a very dark but awesome vibe going on, and the coffee, a washed process Jhoan Vergara Colombia by Perc Roasters in Savannah, GA, was a delight to drink. I chatted with the baristas about some of the other bags on the shelf, but this was the only one available for shots. Very, very nice.

5. Anchor & Tree - This cafe and The Mill were very close in terms of coffee quality for the local roasters, and the washed Ethiopian Acacia I selected from a number of possibilities (they'll pull espresso with any bean they have on hand) was delicious if a very slight bit bitter. The cafe is an active roastery in addition, with the bags of green and eco-friendly Bellwether roasters on full display right on the floor. This place had it all, decor, vibe, great barista chat, and wonderful coffee.

4. The Mill - The runner up for best local roaster on my tour so far, this place was a nice, clean, attractive cafe, but not overly themed or furnished. They clearly put their money into the product, because the Colombian pink bourbon shot I had was a knockout in the cup. The barista and I had a lengthy chat about all things specialty coffee, culminating in him offering a sample of a coffee that they had on the shelf, that was so tasty, I purchased a bag to take home. Truly a great coffee experience.

3. Burnside - This place... has to be seen to be believed. It has a futuristic decor and a vibe that is like nothing else. I had a length chat with Bob, the barista, about some very deep and esoteric specialty coffee topics. They brew coffees from specialty roasters around the world, focusing on those that are really doing advanced techniques such as carbonic masceration, thermal shock, co-ferments and other processing, resulting in some really ""far out"" brews, such as the Apple Pie I had, a Christmas themed co-ferment from Brandywine Roasters in Wilmington, DE, with notes of caramel apple pie, baking sice, and brown sugar. If one could drink the holidays as an espresso, this would be it.

2. Mast - The number one local roaster of the ones I've sampled, I had their Suite 7 ""house blend"" and an Ethiopia Yirgacheffe natural anaerobic, in separate shots, and both were phenomenal. The blend featured brown sugar sweetness with a toasty graham cracker finish, and the Ethiopian combined florality, jammy fruit, and chocolate notes, all in one delicious cup that was simply outstanding. The cafe itself is definitely a bit on the modern industrialist side, but is well lit and inviting. If you're just going to visit one place to see what local roasters can do, this should be towards the top of your list.

1\\. Scorpio - By a decent margin, this was my favorite cafe of the dozen. In the heart of the action on 16th Street, this modestly sized cafe was jam packed with customers on my two visits over as many days, and for good reason. At the time of my visit, they were pulling The Alchemist from DAK, and Jorge Rojas El Jardin from Regalia Coffee in NYC. The DAK was a Rwandan sourced experimental anaerobic red bourbon, featuring tropical fruit and cacao nibs, it was almost the best coffee of this whole tour... until I got to that El Jardin. Another pink bourbon, this time a Colombian washed process bean, the tasting notes included raspberry compote, winey, and cherry candy. The flavor was very intense, and to my delight, the winey note was VERY forward and lasting on the palate, and was without a doubt the top coffee of this trip so far. I was very sad to find they they didn't have any bags for sale, I would have jumped on that. I also bought a Cafec Deep 27 dripper for some small dose pourover experiments and a box of DAK steeped coffee bags that I'll be auditioning for a cruise we're taking in April (those of you specialty coffee drinkers that have suffered through what they serve on cruises as ""coffee"" will probably understand why). If you could visit only one coffee-focused cafe in Sacramento, this is THE place.

Any and all comments welcome, and I'm sure I'll be branded a snob or any number of other things, but coffee is my hobby and I'm into it in a big way, unapologetically. :)

Is this normal or am I being clingy?","Hi everyone, first of all, sorry for my terrible English, but I will do my best to write in a comprehensible way.

As the title says, I had a FWB for 4 months.   
When we first met, I asked him to tell me if he was having fun with someone else because I’ve been having issues with my immune system, and I’m afraid of catching diseases. Just to be clear, I didn’t forbid him, but I asked him to be honest with me because that way, I would stop having fun with him. Especially because he asked me multiple times not to use protection – and I always refused – which made me think he wasn’t using protection with others either. Obviously, he used the excuse that he only asked me because he knows I’m a “good girl” who doesn’t sleep around, but I didn’t believe him.

A month passed, and I noticed we weren’t doing anything together (not even grabbing a coffee) other than just having fun and taking a walk. He responded by saying that he couldn’t be seen with me for cultural and religious reasons .  
Whenever I suggested spending a weekend in the nearby city ( where nobody knows us since it's quite big), he would always refuse. I let it slide because he was struggling financially - this, I thought ,was the actual reason for not wanting to go there- but was still consistent, texting me all day, and always wanting to hang out.

This continued until October, when he no longer had his own apartment and started living with his brother, which meant no more sex. I noticed he was slowly distancing himself, taking hours to respond, and even standing me up three times ( after HE asked me out) at the last minute. When I confronted him about it, he replied : ""Who are you, the police, to force me to hang out if I don’t want to?"" Or ""You’re neither my mom nor my wife."" Things kept getting worse, and he started using stupid excuses not to see me, like ""it’s cold outside,"" or "" i struggle financially , I need a new job and an apartment"" or even ""I caught a cold"" but then he would go to the nearby city (the same city where he never went to with me) to meet up with a ""collegue"" almost everyday.

In the meantime, he kept me entertained with phrases like 'I want to see you, but I don’t have a place' and things like that, until I directly asked if he was seeing someone else and told him to stop making excuses and lying. He got pissed off and confirmed that he was sleeping with a girl he had slept with already two years ago, saying that it's his life and I should mind my own business. Also adding that he has too many issues to think about, let alone this kind of nonsense and that he's even considering suicide as the only resolution.

I don't know if I can express my thoughts correctly, but what pissed me off the most is the disrespect towards me and my free time, in addition to lies and guilt tripping me with his struggles... I do have serious issues too but I don't mistreat people around me.

So, the question is: Am I overreacting for expecting honesty and accountability from a FWB? I never had one, so I don't know the dynamics but I thought that mutual respect was included.",2,1766619105.0,AIO,2,0.75,False

I[27F] have been with mu husband [33M] for 4 years, we recently had a beautiful daughter. I love him with all my heart and we are very happy. Before anyone jumps into conclusions, there are no forms of cheating in any way. We are in a healthy marriage, we respect and love each other, we go on dates, we travel, we have long talks about all kinds of stuff, silly or important, we share our passwords, iPads, laptops, and locations. No sketchy behaviors whatsoever. I need to mention that my husband is not the type of guys who shares everything he’s thinking of or bothering him, and at first this used to bother me because I couldn’t figure out what’s wrong with him, but later I understood how he thinks and things were going well because after he calms down he will come and tell me what was on him mind. Recently we moved from the country we used to live into another country, so lots is happening and he’s doing lots of thinking. I know he is tired, he did most of the packing because I was taking care of the baby. I appreciate everything he’s doing for us. I almost never worry about anything in our lives. I stopped working when I had the baby, we’re doing really well because he worked so hard for a long time. The only issue is that when he thinks a lot he tends to ignore me a little, he’s still so cute, grabs food and coffee and helps around the house. He’s not so physical with me he kisses and hugs but only little, but this is how I knew him from the beginning, unlike me I show so many feelings, love and care I love kissing, hugging and snuggling, and he never rejects me. But recently, I started to feel my he’s becoming a bit cold, we’re not having intimacy as frequently as before. I’m the kind of person that loves to have small talks at bed before going to sleep, and usually this is the time when we have intimacy. Lately, when we go to bed he will always say that he is so tired and wants to sleep right away. He initiate intimacy during other times, but when I try to cuddle with him or ask for some attention, he says tomorrow during the day and he sleeps. This thing is bothering me a lot because as much as I understands him and respect his boundaries and emotions, I need his attention and love. I don’t know if something is wrong or it’s only the moving phase. I know my emotions are valid, but I also don’t think he’s doing it on purpose. He is my best friend, he supports me and listens to all my BS, I cry on his shoulder and being next to him makes me feel safe. He is the best father I’ve ever seen. I need some advice on how to make him feel that I need him and his attention more, I love him to be more physical. Some days I wake up knowing that he is the best man I can be with, but something small is missing, and I don’t want that to become a bigger problem later.

(*Opening credits*)

(*Abe and Gandhi walk down a street lined with identical houses*)

**Abe:** Gandhi, this year is going to be different. I'm taller I've got slightly bigger sideburns...

**Gandhi:** I spent all summer on my high fives and my finger snaps (*demonstrates*). I finally I have the acceptance I've so craved! (*Joan comes up behind them*) Joan of Arc! On top! (*Holds up his hand*)

**Joan:** Don't touch me, Gandhi. (*walks on, leaving Gandhi standing on his own with his hand still raised*)

**Gandhi:** Too slow! (*points*)

(*Abe and Joan walk together*)

**Abe:** Welcome back, Joan.

(*Gandhi pops up between them and stares at Joan's breasts*)

**Gandhi:** You got breasts.

**Joan:** Jeez Abe, you grew like, a foot.

**Gandhi:** You grew like, a pair of breasts.

**Abe:** Luckily the extra height doesn't feel that awkward-- (*Walks into a low hanging branch and falls down*) Dinger! (*Joan and Gandhi continue walking, and Abe stands up a few seconds later*) I'm up.

**Joan:** I wish I'd seen you more over the summer but, (*rolling her eyes*) I was at camp.

**Gandhi:** Was it breast camp?

**Joan:** (*annoyed*) Okay, you get one more.

(*The three clones arrive at Clone High and stop to look at it*)

**Abe:** Well, brand new year, same old faces.

(*JFK and Julius Caesar stand together. Marilyn Monroe walks past*)

**Marilyn Monroe**: (*seductively*) Hiya, Kennedy.

**JFK:** (*To Caesar. JFK speaks in a loud monotone*) I invaded her Bay of Pigs. If you catch my meaning.

(*Elsewhere, the Elvis twins stand together. One of them is overweight and has stubble, the other does not*)

**Skinny Elvis:** Oh yeah. Steamed vegetables. What'd mama make for you?

**Fat Elvis:** Nine fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, and a thermos full of tranquillisers, thankyouverymuch. (*Downs the tranquillisers and falls down happily*) I have left the building.

**Abe:** Man, one of the Elvis twins really let himself go.

**Joan:** (*sighs*) Hasn't anyone here grown at all? (*Gandhi stares at Joan's breasts again. After a second, Joan punches him and he goes down*) You were thinkin' it.

**Gandhi:** (*strained*) I know.

  
(*Students walk through the hallways of the school. Abe and Joan are soon visible*)

**Joan:** You know Abe, I've been thinking, I'm gonna date a lot more this year.

(*Cleopatra walks past on her way to her locker. She opens it as Abe and Joan look at her*)

**Abe:** Uh-huh, yeah, I wanna date Cleopatra. She's attractive, smart, athletic, good looking, she's hot, photogenic, she takes pride in her appearance... (*Cleo closes her locker*) I guess what I'm trying to say is, I admire her commitment to community service.

**Joan:** You don't think dating an old friend would be better? (*sounding steadily more pathetic*) You know, maybe someone that... you know, you take for granted...

**Abe:** Nah, I like Cleo.

**Joan:** But Abe, think about it. Like an old friend, you know--

**Abe:** Nope. Cleo. *Only* Cleo.

(*Joan backs away as Cleo comes up behind Abe*)

**Cleo:** Hi Abe. (*Abe stands there opened mouthed*) Are those longer sideburns?

(*Abe turns to look at Cleo and attempts to speak, but it comes out breathy and unintelligible. Then he grins. He learns against a nearby trophy cabinet, and his hand goes through the glass, knocking down the trophies. A drop of his blood falls onto the floor*)

**Joan:** Abe. I think you're bleeding.

**Abe:** (*strained*) Not. Now.

**Joan:** Fine. (*walks away*) I'll go wait for you by the gauze.

**Gandhi:** (*offscreen*) Cleopatra, comin' at ya! (*Runs into frame and holds up his hand*) Yow!

**Cleo:** Do I know you?

**Gandhi:** Gandhi. We had every class together last year? (*no response*) I gave you one of my kidneys? (*Lifts up his shirt. The scene changes to inside his body. He has only one kidney*)

**Gandhi's remaining kidney:** I miss him.

**Gandhi:** (*dismayed*) I was your foster brother for ten years until you convinced our parents I wasn't good enough for your image and you had me transferred to another home?

**Cleo:** Benji?

**Gandhi:** Gandhi.

**Cleo:** (*falsely sincere*) Oh, that's so great for you. Anyway, Abe, (*Abe hasn't moved*) JFK's having a party Friday. I hope I see you there. (*walks away. As soon as she's gone, Abe regains his powers of speech*)

**Abe:** Hey, Cleo. Why yes, these are longer sideburns.

  
(*A classroom. Mr Sheepman is only seen from behind*)

**Mr Sheepman:** The first day of school's always awkward, and just to let you know, I can relate. You see I'm not just your kindly history teacher, (*Is fully visible. He looks something like an anthropomorphic sheep*) I'm also the... first mostly human clone. Spliced in a little sheep DNA. (*embarrassed*) Which is fine, with me.

**Abe:** You can't even tell, Mr Sheepman.

(*Mr Sheepman takes a bite out of his desk*)

**Mr Sheepman:** Thank you! Before you leave, we have an announcement from Miss Of Arc.

(*Joan comes to the front of the class and recalls what Abe said earlier*)

**Abe:** I admire her commitment to community service.

**Joan:** Now, I know I don't have to tell you how committed I am to community service. (*The students stare at her*) That's why I'm starting a teen crisis hot line, and I'm looking for volunteers. (*Before she can finish the last word, everyone gasps and runs away*)

(*Gandhi has his leg halfway out a window*)

**Abe:** Dude, that's a three story drop!

**Gandhi:** I don't care, I'm goin' for it. (*Jumps out the window and takes a second or two to land*) Oh my god, I can see my bone!

  
(*Scudworth's door, which soon fades into a picture of Abe and Joan seen through a periscope, then Scudworth using the periscope*)

**Scudworth:** Oh young, unsuspecting clones. Little do they know, (*gleeful*) I control them! (*Lets go of the periscope. He is wearing a paper hat*) The greatest minds the world has ever known! (*crazily*) For what, is more powerful, than a high school PRINCIPAL!! (*He lifts his arms in a cackling pose as the last word echoes*)

**Shadowy Figure:** (*offscreen. He speaks briskly*) Doctor Scudworth. (*Scudworth squeaks and freezes. The Shadowy Figure comes through the door*) Sorry to disturb you, but there's growing concern among the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures that you may be... (*in casual tone*) completely insane.

**Scudworth:** (*gripping his desk*) BLASPHEMY! (*opens a drawer, takes off his paper hat, and puts it in among a lot of others*)

**Shadowy Figure:** Yeah, well, you do have a robot butler named Mr Butlertron.

**Mr Butlertron:** (*coming in with a tray. He has a standard robotic voice that usually lowers in pitch at the end of a setence*) Anyone for scones?

**Scudworth:** (*taking one*) Why, creating a mechanical British servant is no more eccentric than that tie you're wearing.

(*The Shadowy Figure looks down, then rolls his eyes. He isn't wearing a tie. Mr Butlertron offers him the tray*)

**Mr Butlertron:** Coffee, Wesley?

**Scudworth:** He calls everyone Wesley. (*Clasps hands affectionately*) Don't know why.

**Shadowy Figure:** Yeah, that's fascinating. But we're paying you to monitor these clones as closely as possible, so if you want to keep your job, you can either write a report proving you know what it's like to be a student at Clone High,

**Scudworth:** I'll do no such thing!

**Shadowy Figure:** Or I'm to kill you.

**Scudworth:** (*Starts typing*) I'll title it, ""What's It's Like To Be A Teenage Clone"" colon, (*presses the colon button and poses*) ""A Rope Of Sand"".

**Mr Butlertron:** Good title. It draws the reader in without giving too much away... Wesley.

  
(*Abe washes his hands in the bathroom. JFK approaches, pointing his finger menacingly*)

**JFK:** Lincoln! I got dibs on that Cleopatra broad, so back off! She's numbers one and two, on my list, of 150 women to bang this year! (*Glares at Abe. Gandhi runs in*)

**Gandhi:** What cha doing in here, buddy, making a... Lincoln log? (*slaps Abe on the back and yells. JFK winces*) What's up, Fitzy baby, party at your place on Friday, right? Rocking!

**Abe:** Yeah, pysched for the rager, j-JFK. Dawg.

**JFK:** I will see you there. And by will, I mean won't! (*He walks out laughing, then comes back in*) 'Cause you're not invited. I, uh, wasn't sure if I was clear earlier. So, uh, you're not. Invited, that is. (*He leaves and comes back in again*) To my party! (*He closes, and immediately opens the door*) Forgot to wash my hands! (*Washes his hands*)

  
(*Establishing shot: The Grassy Knoll Diner. The flag outside is always at half mast. Cleo and JFK share a milkshake in one booth, and Abe, Joan and Gandhi sit in another. Booth, that is. I wasn't sure if I was clear earlier*)

**Abe:** We've gotta get to that party.

**Gandhi:** Dude, we're never going to get invited, sitting here, surrounded by geeks.

**Joan:** (*controlled*) They're not geeks, Gandhi. They're just delightfully eccentric.

(*George Washington Carver pops up from the booth next to them*)

**Carver:** Hello, cohorts. It is I, George Washington Carver. (*Holds up a jar with a peanut*) And I spent my summer bioengineering this anthropomorphic peanut.

**Peanie:** Hi ho, guv'ner. I'd shake your hands, but you know. (*waves his arms*) Peanut arms!

(*Carver grins at them*)

**Joan:** All right, they're geeks, but we have better things to do than worry about who or what we're seen with.

**Abe:** (*Standing up*) No, Gandhi's right. This isn't about who we hang out with. This is about not having to put your hand on your own buttock and pretend it's a woman's breast. (*Joan and Gandhi look at each other*) All I'm sayin' is, a girl is interested in me, and I'm not going to ignore it.

**Joan:** (*Also standing up*) Abe, I want you.

**Abe:** (*subdued*) You want me to what?

**Joan:** Um, um.

**Abe:** (*subdued*) Forget what you were going to say? Happens to me all the time. (*loud*) Well! I'm off! (*He turns to go, and Gandhi stands in his path and looks at him. Obviously he understood what Joan was trying to say*) What?

  
**Abe:** (*Approaching JFK and Cleo's booth*) Kennedy, I have a proposition for you.

**JFK:** (*Poking Abe in the chest*) Mark my words, Lincoln, you and your friends are uh, not coming to that party!

**Abe:** I'll get the beer.

**JFK:** Be there at eight!

(*He and Cleo walk away. Gandhi runs up*)

**Gandhi:** (*pumping his arms*) SHAZAAM! We're in! Any ideas on how to get the beer?

**Abe:** Nope.

(*Ghandi lowers his arms*)

  
(*Gym class*)

**Elanor Roosevelt:** (*An old woman*) It's time for the presidential fitness test! Where we make you even more insecure about your bodies, by checking you while you perform arbitrary physical tasks!

**Abe:** I can't believe we got Elanor Roosevelt as a gym teacher.

**Joan:** (*distracted*) Yeah, he's great. You know Abe, tonight I finally have a night off from the hotline? Which is, community service. So I was thinking we could like, you know, carpool to JFK's party, you know, save gas...

(*Elanor Roosevelt suddenly leans into frame angrily*)

**Elanor Roosevelt:** Like talkin', Of Arc? Well, you can talk your tight little buns into principal Scudworth's office! (*Joan walks off*) Slowly... (*Stares at Joan, who's offscreen*) Oh yeah.

(*Cleo approaches Abe, who chokes again*)

**Cleo:** (*seductively*) Hey, stud. I'm so glad you're getting the beer tonight. I just love underage drinking.

**Abe:** (*strained*) I know? (*Cleo leaves*) Okay, how the hell am I gonna get that beer?

**Gandhi:** Easy. Tell them they heard you wrong. What you said was ""I'll get the *beards*"".

**Abe:** That makes no sense.

**Gandhi:** Yeah, but if you think about it, it would still be a pretty sweet party.

(*Gandhi fantasises about a party in which everyone is wearing beards*)

**Guy:** This is the best party ever, thanks Gandhi!

(*Gandhi, who is with a bearded girl in a bikini, gives a thumbs up. Back in reality, Gandhi grins and Abe glares*)

  
(*Abe and Genghis Khan outside the International House of Beer. The entire sequence has the sound of a ticking clock in the background*)

**Abe:** Okay, Ghengis Khan. If the clerk asks if you're over twenty-one, say yes, got it?

(*Genghis nods. The next scene is inside*)

**Clerk:** You over twenty-one?

(*Genghis says nothing. The next scene is at the Gas n Save n Guzzle n Such*)

**Abe:** Okay. He used a very tricky line of questioning. Let's practice again. Are you over twenty-one?

**Genghis:** (*nods*) Yes.

(*Inside the petrol station*)

**Another clerk:** You over twenty-one?

**Genghis:** No.

(*In another place that sells beer, Genghis Khan has a sign on him reading ""I AM 21"". Abe and Gandhi are standing behind him*)

**Third clerk:** So I guess you're twenty-one.

**Genghis:** I am twenty-one. (*He walks away with a huge keg of beer, then comes back*) I'm not twenty-one!

  
(*Establishing shot: Scudworth's door. Joan is tied to a chair in front of his desk*)

**Scudworth:** Miss Of Arc! I'll overlook your little gym class disruption if you'll help me with a report I'm writing. Tell me your likes and dislikes!

**Joan:** (*annoyed*) Well... I dislike being tied to a chair.

**Scudworth:** Good! (*Types*) I'll use a big font, futz with the margins... and I'll be home in time for Jay Leeno!

**Joan:** (*sniggers*) You would like Leno.

**Scudworth:** (*stands and points*) How dare you insult that big chinned everyman and his various African-American bandleaders! Perhaps you'll learn some respect spending the rest of the afternoon in my DEATH MAZE!

(*He presses a button and laughs crazily as Joan is sucked up into a tube*)

**Scudworth:** Oh, this is useless. I need to observe the teenagers in their element. I will be Diane Fossy, and they the gorillas. (*dramatic*) But where, can I find, the mist?

(*The PA crackles*)

**JFK:** (*Over PA*) Attention students. JFK will be having a huge kegger night. STUDENTS ONLY! (*quickly*) That is all.

(*Scudworth raises an eyebrow*)

  
(*In a classroom, Mr Sheepman and Gandhi are sitting at a table labeled ""TEEN CRISIS HOTLINE"". Mr Sheepman is on the phone, and Gandhi has his feet on the table*)

**Mr Sheepman:** You seem to have this compulsion to ""nail"" Cleo. Whaddaya think drives this desire to act overly macho?

(*JFK is on the other side of the phone*)

**JFK:** Well uh, it's my foster parents. You uh, know that show ""My Two Dads""? It's uh, like that but more gay!

(*Pan to JFK's gay foster dads, Wally and Carl*)

**Wally:** Mm, look how nice he looks in the dockers we bought him.

**JFK:** Daaaad!

**Carl:** (*annoyed*) What, you're too good to be gay like your old man?!

**Wally:** Carl, it is not his fault. Baby was born that way.

  
(*Back in the classroom, Joan falls from the roof*)

**Gandhi:** Death maze, huh?

**Mr Sheepman:** Oh, I was in the maze once. It was hot. You know, I'm hot now. I think I'll take my shirt off. (*He grabs a razor and shears off the wool on his stomach. Joan and Gandhi stare at him*) Ah! Ready for the weekend!

**Joan:** Gandhi, I think it's really big of you to skip the party and work the hotline tonight.

(*Gandhi is halfway out the window*)

**Gandhi:** Uh, of course. (*sadly*) Sure, I buckled under the pressure of living up to the original Gandhi and became a non stop... party machine, but damnit, I still care. (*He lifts up his palms and dilates his pupils to show sincerity*) So... Joan? You can count on me.

  
(*Cut to the party. Gandhi is on his phone and yelling to be heard over the music*)

**Gandhi:** Uh no, no, I'm not at a party, we're just really busy here at the teen hotline! (*He yells as a couple of girls walk past.*) Susie, Kelly, do me a favour and make out! (*He laughs, then puts the phone back to his ear*) So, you're depressed.

(*Abe arrives*)

**Abe:** Hey everybody, it's me, Abe!

(*A group of students respond unenthusiastically*)

**Abe:** Hey everybody, it's a keg of beer!

**Group of Students:** (*Happily*) Abe!

  
(*Abe and Gandhi stand on a balcony with some beers*)

**Abe:** Hey, I thought you had to work the hotline tonight.

**Gandhi:** No man, I just forwarded the calls to my cell phone! (*Speaks into it*) Look, I'll talk to you when you can stop *crying*. (*hangs up and drinks the beer*)

**Abe:** You're not afraid of Joan catching and ultimately killing you?

**Gandhi:** (*drops the beer and speaks sarcastically*) Oh, uh, I'm scared. Well I think I'll just jump of this balcony in case  
she-- (*sees something inside*) Oh my God! (*He jumps off the balcony*)

(*Joan comes out*)

**Joan:** Well congratulations, Abe. The people were clamouring to make asses of themselves, and you gave them the means to do it.

(*Julius Caesar, Nostradamus, Genghis Khan and someone else drink beer*)

**Abe:** Not exactly. I... uh, I could only get non-alcoholic beer. (*Joan looks at him*) They're going to be able to tell.

(*Julius Caesar, Nostradamus, Genghis Khan and someone else are naked*)

**Nostradamus:** I'm a pony.

**Joan:** You'll be fine.

**Abe:** Joan, do you ever like someone so much you're afraid you're gonna blurt out something stupid?

**Joan:** I have a rash on my back.

  
(*The shadows of Scudworth and Mr Butlertron are seen on JFK's front door*)

**Mr Butlertron:** Are you sure this is the best way to do research? Won't they be able to tell we're not students?

**Scudworth:** You underestimate me, my metal friend. (*They go inside. Scudworth is wearing a backwards baseball cap, a shirt and baggy pants and Mr B is more or less the same*) Whassup, fellow students? (*raising his hands*) *Raise* the *roof*! Raise it!

(*The students stare at him. Scudworth kicks Mr Butlertron without looking at him*)

**Mr Butlertron:** (*raising his pincers*) Where are my bitches?

  
(*Vincent Van Gough is in his room on the phone*)

**Van Gough:** Sometimes I just turn the lights off in my room and cry.

**Gandhi:** (*Holding back laughter*) I'm sorry uh, Van Gough, could you speak up?

(*Gandhi is holding the phone up and a bunch of students are listening*)

**Van Gough:** The only way I can... cling to my sanity is that nobody knows how... lonely I truely am.

**Gandhi:** (*sniggering*) He's sad.

(*Everyone laughs*)

**Some Guy:** Hilarious!

**Van Gough:** Hey. Am I on speakerphone?

**Gandhi:** (*To the party in general*) Hey, would Gandhi put somebody on speakerphone?

**Clones:** No!

(*Van Gough is annoyed*)

**Van Gough:** Jesus Gandhi, how could you?

**Gandhi:** Hey man, Gandhi's anti-violence, not anti-comedy. (*closes the phone*) Whew. Feels good to help people.

  
(*Joan sits on a swing all alone. Mr Butlertron approaches her*)

**Mr Butlertron:** Want to talk about it?

**Joan:** You wouldn't understand.

**Mr Butlertron:** Maybe you should tell Abe how you really feeeeeeel.

(*Joan looks up*)

**Joan:** What good would that do? (*Looks down again*)

**Mr Butlertron:** Maybe he just thinks you don't think he doesn't want to not ruin the friendship.

**Joan:** You make it sound so simple. (*cheering up*) Maybe one of us just needs to make the first move.

**Mr Butlertron:** Maybe that one of us... is yoouu.

(*Joan hugs him*)

**Joan:** Thanks, Mr B. (*Mr B's antenna goes up*) I love you.

**Mr Butlertron:** Don't mention it... Wesley.

  
(*Cleo has her arm around Abe*)

**Cleo:** You know Abe, maybe it's the beer talking. (*drinks beer*)

**Abe:** I doubt it.

**Cleo:** It's just... I always saw you as this honest guy, but now I'm seeing you as a cool guy who just happens to be honest. Doesn't that blow your mind?

**Abe:** That's me. Cool, honest Abe.

**Cleo:** (*Pulls Abe towards her so that their noses are touching*) Oh, Abe. It's like there's a tin can phone from your brain to my heart.

(*Joan walks back to the party purposefully. Cleo and Abe lean in close to each other. Joan gasps. Abe and Cleo kiss messily. The camera pans up to an above ground swimming pool, where Gandhi is standing on a boat and posing.*)

**JFK:** (*randomly popping out of the boat with a girl*) That no good cheating tramp! (*To Gandhi*) Hey, get off my dinghy! (*The girl he is with stands up*) Not you. (*Walks up to Abe and Cleo*) What do you think you are uh, doing?

**Abe:** Look Kennedy, we kissed. And I don't wanna exaggerate the importance of it, but (*menacing*) we're gonna be together forever.

**JFK:** Come on, she's drunk! She also kissed the talking peanut!

**Peanie:** Right here on me left nut! (*points*)

**JFK:** So uh, who's it gonna be?

**Abe:** Cleo, I care about you. And every moment we spend together makes me want to know you more.

**JFK:** (*lifts up his shirt*) My abs are so firm you can grate cheese on 'em!

**Cleo:** It's so hard to choose. (*puts a hand to her forehead*) I need some time to be alone! (*runs away. Abe and JFK glare at each other*)

**JFK:** (*taking some nachos and offering them to Abe*) Nacho?



(*Gandhi sits on the keg of beer and Joan watches him*)

**Gandhi:** (*on the phone*) Oh man, that does suck. (*Amused*) If that were me, I would totally kill myself. Hello? (*Shrugs, hangs up, and squirts some beer into his mouth. Then he notices Joan*) Hey Joan, cool stun gun! (*Joan zaps him with the stun gun*) Wait, I can-- (*Joan zaps him again*) Ow! I'm forwarding-- (*and again*) Oo! Egg whites only. (*Falls down, dropping the phone. Joan grabs it*)

**Joan:** (*Into phone*) Teen Crisis Hotline, we're here because we care. (*Zaps Gandhi again*)

  
(*A blindfolded Genghis Khan hits Scudworth, who's tied up and hanging from the roof like a pinata*)

**Scudworth:** Not a pinata! It's me! Your memorable school chum, Cloney McStudent!

**Genghis:** Pinata! (*Whacks Scudworth again*)

  
(*Joan is still on the phone*)

**Joan:** Uh-huh. Well, choosing between a jerk who's good for your image and a nice sensitive guy is not really much of a problem... (*She looks in a window and notices that it's Cleopatra she's on the phone to*)

**Cleo:** What should I do?

(*Joan gasps*)

**Joan:** (*panicked*) Go for the jerk! Ooh, and sleep with him right away, it's never too early for your first time. Oh and also, don't floss your teeth.

**Cleo:** (*writing*) Hmm. You do have to make sacrifices to be the best.

(*Joan looks over at Abe, who is sitting on the ladder to the pool looking depressed. She sighs*)

**Joan:** (*under her breath*) Dammit. (*aloud, reluctantly*) You know what? Go with the nicer guy. (*Goes to hang up, then remembers something*) And, flossing keeps gums healthy and removes plaque from hard to brush areas.

(*Joan hangs up and Gandhi comes out from behind the keg*)

**Gandhi:** (*Points at Joan*) Whew! Did you just screw yourself! Whoa! (*Joan takes his belt*) You know, even if these pants do fall off, I'm still wearing boxers. (*Joan holds out some boxers. Gandhi's pants fall off. He looks down*) Ah, good thing there was no one around to see that.

(*Gandhi walks off and the camera pans to a pair of eyes in the bushes. It's Vincent Van Gough*)

**Van Gough:** (*sinister*) Oh yes. No one indeed.

  
(*Cleo stands between JFK and Abe*)

**Cleo:** After consulting, a random person on the telephone, I've come to a decision. (*points at Abe*) I choose you.

**JFK:** (*frustrated*) Oh! Dammit. (*He leaves*)

**Cleo:** Abe.

(*Abe falls between the rungs of the ladder*)

**Abe:** (*squeaky*) Happy.

(*Shot of George Washington Carver with Peanie on his shoulder*)

**Peanie:** Sorry my dear boy, salty seconds! (*laughs*)

(*JFK offers a beer to Joan*)

**JFK:** Wanna beer?

**Joan:** Sure. Maybe pretending to be drunk will ease the pain. (*They drink*)

**JFK:** So uh, are you uh, drunk enough yet to sleep with me? (*Joan doesn't react for a second, then she kicks him in the head and he goes down*) Bobby! (*After another second, JFK sits up*) Answer the question!

  
(*A police car shows up and the clones run around in panic. Cleo pulls Abe into the bushes*)

**Abe:** Dinger!

(*The sheriff gets out of the car*)

**Sheriff:** Well, well, well. If it isn't my old friend. Underage drinking. So we meet again. How are you, underage drinking? Besides illegal? (*He pours a cup of beer onto the ground. Gandhi pops in from the top of the frame and lands on the car*)

**Gandhi:** (*Drunkenly*) Underage drinking? Shame on all of you! Shaaame! (*Points at Sheriff*) Back to you, Kojack.

**Sheriff:** (*grabbing Gandhi*) This kid's not sober, is he? (*Points*) And none of you are twenty-one, are you? (*Holds up a pot sticker*) And these pot stickers aren't made with real crab, are they? (*Takes a bite*) I stand corrected. (*To Joan*) You! You're holding a beer, get in. Get in! (*Joan gets in*) Well that's two, which is all we can fit in the squad car. The rest of you are free to go.

**Cleo:** (*With her arm in Abe's*) Come on Abe. Leave your friends behind, and come back to my soundproofed basement.

(*Joan looks at Abe from the police car. Cleo leads Abe away and the sheriff carries Gandhi into the car. Abe pulls out of Cleo's grip and steps over the hedge separating them from the road*)

**Abe:** Let. Them. Go.

**Sheriff:** Son. If we don't enforce the drinking age, then the excitement of sneaking around to get wasted might disappear forever. Do you want that on your shoulders, pal?

**Abe:** (*reluctant*) It's... non alcoholic beer.

(*The partygoers gasp*)

**Gandhi:** (*points*) I knew it!

**Abe:** I guess I was just looking for what all of us are. (*Looks at Cleo and JFK*) Acceptance.

**Sheriff:** (*fake coughs*) Loser!

(*The others laugh at Abe. Abe looks down.*)

**JFK:** (laughing) He coughed!

**Sheriff:** (High fiving an associate) I am so funny. (Laughs)

  
(*Clone high, the next day. A heavily injured Scudworth kicks open the door of his office with the leg that isn't in a cast. He turns on the light*)

**Shadowy Figure:** (*offscreen*) Where's my report?

(*Scudworth yells in surprise and jumps backwards. Mr B catches him*)

**Scudworth:** Shadowy Figure! It's actually a funny story. I was working on it, and I tried to email it to myself, but then my roommate--

**Shadowy Figure:** That *is* a funny story. Mr Butlertron. Lower the shades and lay down a tarp. (*Mr Butlertron goes to comply*)

**Scudworth:** Okay! I spent an entire weekend among the teenagers! I was humiliated, degraded, judged. (*rocks in the fetal position*) I felt so alone. (*Stops rocking and looks at the Shadowy Figure. He's gone*) Where'd he go?

**Mr Butlertron:** I guess you proved to him you understand what it feels like to be a teenager... and a pinata.

**Scudworth:** (*Coming out of his office*) Well from now on, I'll be more sensitive to the awkwardness and the emotional insecurity of today's youth! (*slamming a locker door on a boy's head*) Out of my way, fatty! (*To a girl*) You too, bad skin. (*The girl sobs*)

  
(*Abe, Gandhi and Joan walk to school*)

**Abe:** Well, I'm not gonna let this get me down. (*He is knocked down by the same tree branch as before*) Dinger! (*He stands up*) I'm up!

**Gandhi:** Look, right now you're a loser, a big one, but soon someone else will make an even bigger ass of themselves, and everyone else will forget about what a big big big big loser you are.

(*He hears laughter and sees a mural, which everyone is pointing and laughing at. It's Van Gough's Starry Night painting, with words up the top reading ""TEEN CRISIS HOTLINE"", naked Gandhi, and a speech bubble reading ""NO PROBLEM TOO* ***SMALL****!"" Van Gough stands at the bottom sniggering. Joan waves*)

1puzz3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1puzz3p/2_weeks_post_op_update/,2 weeks post op update!,"hi. 2 weeks post op. went back to work for 2 days (i teach) and it went ok! towards the end of the day my stomach would start to ache near my bellybutton. after i got my surgery there was a big lump near my bellybutton. its gotten progressively smaller as ive healed but its still there. im not lifting anything over 20 lbs as i heal. it feels like irritated skin almost like my waistband keeps rubbing against it. the pain feels like rubbing my skin raw in a way. it happens with a lot of movement or standing for a long time which i do as i teach. 
been trying different foods and drinks. tried caffeine in diet coke and that was fine. tried coffee with some 2% milk and it wasnt. i keep having bad reactions to 2% milk even though i have less than the serving size (so less than 5 grams of fat). i ate goldfish and that was good though. i had goldfish way over the serving size so not low fat at all and it didnt bother me at all. im curious if the milk fat is too much for me. ive been having issues with an acidic stomach and needing to take prilosec to stop the aching. my safe foods have become fresh fruits and veggies and veggie sushi. 
still testing and seeing what i can have. makes me nervous. my family is going on vacation to a very food-touristy area and im afraid of eating there and not having access to a toilet. it almost makes me want to stay behind. i also dont want to miss out. i wish my body would recover more quickly and i wouldnt have to be afraid to eat. it doesnt hurt or anything, i just tend to need to have to use the bathroom after. 
i have been getting phantom pains though like some in my right shoulder or an occasional ache in my chest or back. way better than it was before the surgery though.

I'm 46 years old from a little bit of everywhere, currently finishing up my second Master's Degree (an MBA) in New Orleans and hoping to relocate to the New Jersey / New York area for my PhD starting in the fall.

A lazy Catholic, but that's not a requirement for you. I like board games, video games, trivia, books (over 100 books in my Goodreads this year), movies (especially horror and sci-fi), and restaurants and cozy bars.

I am neurodivergent in all the best ways, am tactfully sarcastic with just a touch of self-deprecating humor. I'm neither a night owl or a morning person. I've got a few good hours in me between say 11:00AM and 8:30PM, otherwise coffee is love, coffee is life. But we handle business!

I walk with a bit of a swagger thanks to a bad knee. It doesn't slow me down much, though, and I stay busy.

Games I'm playing:

* Borderlands 4
* Diablo IV
* Enshrouded
* No Man's Sky

Games I would LOVE to play:

* A good MMO
* Couch co-op
* Fun/silly brain break games
* Board games like Catan (seriously, teach me!) 
* D&D with a fun group

What I am looking for:

I'm open to friendship or dating, but I'd like something lasting with a special woman. Someone who can be my peace when the world gets rough. Someone loyal and protective, and willing to put in the work. I have dreams, goals, and aspirations and I am working hard to achieve them, and I'm looking for someone with their own. ""Ride or die"" gets thrown around a lot, but that's definitely the vibe I'm hoping for.

If this sounds like you, I'd love to hear from you. Find me on Discord!

Of course my teacher noticing that I had become detached proceeded to intervene. They had me tested assuming I must have some kind of disability. All they came away with was that I had an ""anti-social personality"" (not the disorder) but they put me in special ed anyway. I started to be pulled out of class with the other special needs kids.

Regardless of if this was the right call or not which I think could be debated, I don't blame these adults for anything. I gave them reason to be concerned after all. Don't know if I was just having some kind of tantrum or what. Or maybe I have Aspergers and they missed it. I've had a doctor suggest that and it certainly lines up with some of my behavior.

Being in this new category affected how I was viewed by my classmates as well as my own self esteem. I still managed to maintain friendships. Some of which were made before I detached and others even after (people still talked to me). My classroom behavior remained the same year after year. I didn't speak beyond saying the bare minimum.

My grades were average. At the beginning of middle school I actually began to excel for a brief period of time. I managed to use this to get myself out of special ed. It didn't really matter because the damage was done concerning the way I was perceived. Of course I suppose I could have shocked everyone and started talking all the time one day, but as a kid I just kept following the same old patterns that were comfortable to me.

Essentially everyone aside from those in my friend group went on believing I had a disability and treating me accordingly. It began to not really bother me over time and middle school was probably the best years of my life. I reflect fondly on school dances, trips to amusements parks, sleepovers etc with my pals. Dating was out of the question but I looked at it as an exciting thing for the future. Most kids weren't doing it yet anyway.

Everything changed on the last day of 8th grade. You see, I had been engaging in another more subtle self-sabotage mission for a couple of years. At the lunch table I had been telling inappropriate jokes on a routine basis. Most of my friend group seemed to find it funny but one kid took issue with the things I was saying. His parents were police officers and he was a little more of a tightly wound type.

He reported me to the guidance counselors office. I received a stern talking to by a mustached man. I ran to the lunch table the next day talking about it and wondering who reported me. Of course this lead to the gossip spreading around my school. On top of being mysterious and a little scary, I had now also gained a reputation as disgusting.

My friends stopped hanging out with me at this point, presumably not wanting to be associated with me. They did prank call me from a sleepover together to make fun of me no longer having any friends. High school started off pretty miserable. I now sat alone at lunch everyday and got bullied by seniors as the low man on totem pole.

In a way high school aside from grade 9 still seems ideal to me now. I managed to pick up a one off friend here and there. We would go to a fair or to the casino. Eventually I was invited back into my middle school friend group and I joined a film club with them in which we would produce little sketches.

Then I graduated in 2018. This is when things became 100% cooked for me. I went to a small college an hour from home. My ability to connect with people was non-existent. I was already in the habit of barely talking and this didn't change. Again, my continued self sabotage. Started having panic attacks in 2021 and dropped out of physical school.

I started living at home finishing my degree very slowly, only completing it last May after 7 whole years. All this time having very little interaction with the outside world. I started a YouTube channel in 2023 and had a scant few people enjoy my videos at least. I have a shred of charm in front of a camera but not enough to earn any kind of a real following.

I majored in political science though I am not going into the field. Instead I will be working at a coffee shop my parents who work in the restaurant industry are starting. It will just be me and an older woman who doesn't speak English very well. I will be dealing with customers all day, and am just hoping I will be able to rely on my NPC script to get me through the it.

I know i'm still just a kid but I can't help but think the rest of my life sounds grime. It goes without saying but i've never been in a relationship. I haven't had any friends for 7 years now and will be dealing with whatever hell people want to give me in a customer service position. I bused tables in high school so I know how that goes a bit. I have an overbearing father and am really sick of living at home as well.

All in all it's probably exactly what I deserve, but the victim side of me wants to say I didn't do enough to earn this form of eternal damnation. Maybe I should take accountability for myself and join some kind of adult club. It sounds like painful exposure therapy for my social anxiety. Plus I feel like a 12 year old in any adult space. So i'm probably not going to force myself to do such a thing anytime soon.

I guess this is just a long tale of squandered potential. If you've read this far I appreciate it. Definitely leave me a comment because you're probably the only one.

**TITLE:** Christmas Cafe Confession

**SUMMARY:** You're a barista working on Christmas Eve when your regular customer—the one who orders the same latte every single day—nervously asks to buy you a drink. After months of silent pining, she finally works up the courage to tell you everything from her heart.

**TAGS:** \[F4F\] \[Confession\] \[Coffee Shop Romance\] \[Christmas Eve\] \[Nervous\] \[Heartfelt\] \[First Date\] \[Sweet\] \[Emotional\] \[Happy Ending\] \[Holiday Romance\] \[Slow Burn\] \[Long Ramble-y Monologue\]

**WORD COUNT:** \~2800 words.

\[START\]

*(Soft Christmas music playing in background, café ambiance, coffee machine humming, gentle chatter, door chime jingling.)*

**Speaker:**  
*(Footsteps approaching counter.)*  
Hi! Um, the usual, please. Medium latte with—

**Listener:**  
Oat milk and a half pump of vanilla?

**Speaker:**  
*(Laughs nervously.)*  
Yeah. You... you remember.  
*(Pause, softer.)*  
You always remember.

**Listener:**  
Of course. Four months of the same order? I'd be a pretty bad barista if I forgot.

**Speaker:**  
*(Warm laugh.)*  
Still. It's nice. Makes me feel... I don't know, seen, I guess?  
*(Clears throat awkwardly.)*  
That probably sounds ridiculous.

*(Espresso machine whirring, milk steaming.)*

The decorations look beautiful, by the way.  
Did you do all this yourself? The garland, the lights, that tree in the corner?

**Listener:**  
*(Slightly distracted, working.)*  
Mmhmm. Me and the team stayed late last week.

**Speaker:**  
It really shows. It feels so cozy in here.  
Like... like the kind of place you'd see in a movie, you know?  
Where something magical happens on Christmas Eve.

*(Nervous laugh, pause.)*

Actually, um... speaking of Christmas Eve...  
Can I ask you something? And you can totally say no—  
Actually, you know what, this is stupid. Never mind.

**Listener:**  
What is it?

**Speaker:**  
*(Taking a breath.)*  
Okay. Okay, I'm just going to say it.  
Can I... can I buy you a drink?

*(Pause. Espresso machine stops.)*

**Listener:**  
You want to buy me a drink?

**Speaker:**  
*(Rushing, embarrassed.)*  
I know! I know how it sounds.  
""Can I buy you a drink at the place where you literally work?""  
It's absurd. I didn't think this through.

I just meant—maybe you could take a break?  
Just for a few minutes?  
And we could sit down together?

*(Mumbling.)*  
God, I sound like an idiot right now.

**Listener:**  
*(Chuckle.)*  
You don't sound like an idiot.

**Speaker:**  
I don't?

**Listener:**  
No. I think it's sweet.  
Let me just finish making this, and then... yeah. Let's sit down.

**Speaker:**  
*(Shocked.)*  
Wait—really? You'll actually—

**Listener:**  
Hey Marcus, can you cover the register for a bit?

**Speaker:**  
*(Breathless.)*  
Oh my god, you're serious.  
Okay. Um, I'll—I'll grab that table by the window?  
The one with the view of the street?

**Listener:**  
Perfect. Give me two minutes.

*(Footsteps, chair scraping against floor, sitting down.)*

**Speaker:**  
*(Muttering to self, nervous breathing.)*  
Oh my god. Okay. This is happening.  
She said yes.  
Don't mess this up. Don't be weird.

*(Deep breath, trying to calm down.)*

Just... be yourself. You can do this.  
You've been planning this for weeks.  
Four months of coming here every single day, and this is it.  
This is your chance.

*(Footsteps approaching, two mugs being set down gently on table.)*

**Listener:**  
Here we go. Gingerbread latte for you—on the house.

**Speaker:**  
Gingerbread latte? Oh, you didn't have to—I already have my usual latte…

**Listener:**  
Holiday special. Everyone gets one free today.

**Speaker:**  
*(Soft laugh.)*  
Well, thank you.

*(Sipping, genuine reaction.)*  
Oh wow. This is... this is incredible.  
What's in this? It tastes like Christmas.

**Listener:**  
Espresso, steamed milk, gingerbread syrup, a little cinnamon and nutmeg.

**Speaker:**  
It's perfect.

*(Pause, gathering courage.)*  
Everything you make is perfect, honestly.  
I don't think I've ever had a bad drink here.  
Not once in four months.

**Listener:**  
I'm glad you like it.

**Speaker:**  
Like it? I'm obsessed with it.  
*(Nervous laugh.)*  
Sorry, that probably sounds like I'm trying too hard.  
I just—I really mean it.  
This place has kind of become... essential to my daily routine, you know?

*(Pause, watching the street outside.)*

I love this table. You can see everyone walking by with their shopping bags.  
That couple across the street just stopped to look at the window display.  
Everyone looks so happy.

*(Turning attention back.)*

So, um... can I ask you something?  
Do you work here full-time?  
Or do you just cover shifts sometimes?

**Listener:**  
I work here every day, actually. I own the café.

**Speaker:**  
*(Choking slightly on drink, coughing.)*  
I'm sorry—what?

**Listener:**  
I own it.

**Speaker:**  
*(Disbelief.)*  
You \*own\* this place?  
This whole café?

**Listener:**  
The whole thing.

**Speaker:**  
But you're—you're always behind the counter.  
Making drinks, taking orders, wiping down tables.  
I just assumed you were... I mean, I thought you were one of the baristas.

**Listener:**  
I am. I'm just also the owner.

**Speaker:**  
*(Still processing.)*  
That's—wow.  
I don't even know what to say.  
That's actually incredible.

***Merry Christmas Eve!*** 

Not going to lie, today mentally has been one of my hardest days in recovery. Work was stressful asf. I am very stressed for tomorrow. Food indecision was hell. I feel overstimulated to say the least. Things then got worse when dad decided to drink his feelings (yet again) and he got pretty aggressive which just ruined what was supposed to be an evening of us watching movies together. Instead he had to go to bed otherwise he would have done something stupid. This left me so stressed and sad and I got SO overwhelmed making my chocolate plate, it took me 45 minutes to choose something. I had actually decided a NOMO reindeer but didn't like the taste. Then I was thinking of sticking with something I had before, but decided on the crispy rolls, which then weren't great so my head is going wild!! I don't know what has set my head off so badly tonight, am I tired from work? am I not eating enough? has dad set me off? is this just part of recovery?

Regarding tomorrow, we are going to my sisters in the morning for breakfast which will be a massive change in routine but determined to try enjoy it! Then me and dad will come home and we have a neighbour over and then I will probably just cook myself my dinner (we do have turkey steaks) so gonna do somewhat of a dinner that I can tolerate but is still Christmassy. I am dreading the day though to be completely transparent, after tonight I am so upset with my dad, he has just ruined it. I don't want to do dinner with him, but I suppose at least I will get to have breakfast at my sisters. I would love to hear what you all get up to and would love to see some uploads of all the amazing food! 

In terms of hunger, things are so random. This morning I woke up super nauseous, not hungry. This lasted most of the day. Then I got really hungry after dinner but then now I feel nauseous again. It is all VERY up and down.

Typing this out tonight has ***really*** helped me and my anxiety. It has helped me see I am not alone, I have all you cheering me on and tomorrow I can just do my best and checkin with you all throughout the day! It has also made me rationalise my stupid brain - yes the crispy rolls and my lunch weren't great today but it is okay! I can have something new tomorrow, I keep feeling like this is the last time I can eat but it is not. It has also made me confident I CAN do breakfast at my sister's tomorrow, miss my oats and have a pastry and nothing bad will happen. It is one day (I will probably just have my porridge later lol)! Hope you all are well and have a great day tomorrow!",8,1766618093.0,recoveryplates,5,0.84,False

Hi everyone! I, 26F, am considering applying to the Conservation Corps. I‘m needing a life change, preferably something that is outside, doing manual labor, and away from home for a temporary period. I currently work full time in the service industry and my apartment lease ends in July. I’m hoping to dedicate 3-6 months to the corps, with a preference for California.  

I’m mostly looking for guidance on the interviewing process, overall timeline, and general experiences anybody had as an applicant and participant. Being 26, I definitely need more information in order to plan out my life financially. I don’t expect to make any money while in the corps, just would like to be able to pay my car insurance and other bills in the meantime. 

For the application, I wouldn’t be able to put any educational info on there, since I am a college dropout (ty covid). Any leadership and outdoor experience I have is from being the scouts over ten years ago. It’s relevant in that I‘ve done backpacking trips and outdoor labor, along with working as a camp counselor, but I’m reluctant to put 10+ year old info on an application. I’m in a specialized managerial position at the moment (director of education at a coffee roastery), but not sure how well that works on an application.   


For the timeline of the application, if anyone has some info on how long the process took, how many steps there are, and how long between getting a “yes” and placement in a position. Wondering if it would be possible to begin my application now, but then delay placement by a couple of months if accepted (just to get everything squared away and lined up ok).  

Any info or advice is appreciated! Thank you so much :)",2,1766618093.0,ConservationCorps,0,1.0,False

Appreciate any feedback or if anyone else has experienced something similar to the following:

*I was in the car about to park in some plaza when I saw several (maybe four or five) spheres with a thick ring around them floating in the air, they all moved in unison until all of a sudden it became one big one hovering there, and as a I rushed to try to take a photo of it, which I thought I did, I looked at my phone when it started to scramble.*

*All of a sudden, I was jolted awake inside a coffee shop in that plaza, sitting at a table with a notebook in front of me. I knew I had blacked out for a while, and when I woke up in the dream, there was a guy sitting near me and he said that I had been asleep/out of it for a while. I was shaking, trying to catch my breath, trying to process what had just happened, as I felt I had been somewhere else against my will. I looked down at my notepad and there were some things written down and from the little that I can remember, on the top right corner there were two lines of four letter sequences, like different codes or something. Then further down the page, there were four lines written out and the only two that I can vaguely remember was talking about if X doesn't happen by X time they need to shift or pivot, and the other was that 'they needed more people.' I wish I could remember the rest but it's like I scanned it once in the dream and then it became fuzzy.*

*As I looked around me, I felt like my senses were heightened and for some reason I was drawn towards this older man that I did not know, and I dropped down near his feet and just threw my head in my hands and wept over what had just happened, I was more shaken even though I had no recollection of what had just happened, and when I woke up for real, tears were coming down my face and I just kept saying out loud 'I want to understand, help me understand.'*

Curious if anyone has any further insight. I clearly came back with 'information' and what happened while I was blacked out is quite literally blacked out of my mind, so I don't know everything that happened, but it seems like I was taken for a while. I'm not sure how this translates to the reality of this happening in our awake dimension beyond the dream dimension, or if it even matters.

At the lunch table I had been telling inappropriate jokes on a routine basis. Most of my friend group seemed to find it funny but one kid took issue with the things I was saying. His parents were police officers and he was a little more of a tightly wound type.

He reported me to the guidance counselors office. I received a stern talking to by a mustached man. I ran to the lunch table the next day talking about it and wondering who reported me. Of course this lead to the gossip spreading around my school. On top of being mysterious and a little scary, I had now also gained a reputation as disgusting.

My friends stopped hanging out with me at this point, presumably not wanting to be associated with me. They did prank call me from a sleepover together to make fun of me no longer having any friends. High school started off pretty miserable. I now sat alone at lunch everyday and got bullied by seniors as the low man on totem pole.

In a way high school aside from grade 9 still seems ideal to me now. I managed to pick up a one off friend here and there. We would go to a fair or to the casino. Eventually I was invited back into my middle school friend group and I joined a film club with them in which we would produce little sketches.

Then I graduated in 2018. This is when things became 100% cooked for me. I went to a small college an hour from home. My ability to connect with people was non-existent. I was already in the habit of barely talking and this didn't change. Again, my continued self sabotage. Started having panic attacks in 2021 and dropped out of physical school.

I started living at home finishing my degree very slowly, only completing it last May after 7 whole years. All this time having very little interaction with the outside world. I started a YouTube channel in 2023 and had a scant few people enjoy my videos at least. I have a shred of charm in front of a camera but not enough to earn any kind of a real following.

I majored in political science though I am not going into the field. Instead I will be working at a coffee shop my parents who work in the restaurant industry are starting. It will just be me and an older woman who doesn't speak English very well. I will be dealing with customers all day, and am just hoping I will be able to rely on my NPC script to get me through the it.

I know i'm still just a kid but I can't help but think the rest of my life sounds grime. It goes without saying but i've never been in a relationship. I haven't had any friends for 7 years now and will be dealing with whatever hell people want to give me in a customer service position. I bused tables in high school so I know how that goes a bit. I have an overbearing father and am really sick of living at home as well.

All in all it's probably exactly what I deserve, but the victim side of me wants to say I didn't do enough to earn this form of eternal damnation. Maybe I should take accountability for myself and join some kind of adult club. It sounds like painful exposure therapy for my social anxiety. Plus I feel like a 12 year old in any adult space. So i'm probably not going to force myself to do such a thing anytime soon.

I guess this is just a long tale of squandered potential. If you've read this far I appreciate it. Definitely leave me a comment because you're probably the only one. Tell me what you think I should do, where you think I went wrong, what you think might be wrong with me, whatever comes to mind.",2,1766618022.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

Context:
There's this guy I've met here from reddit, we moved to TG and eventually IG (main accounts namin).

Nagkita na kami in person quite a couple of times na. To grab a coffee, go for a run, for dinner etc. He always says the right words, gentleman, mabait sa ibang tao (he would often greet or smile and nod sa mga guards, servers and other people sa places na pinupuntahan namin)

He constantly messages me din and updates me kahit di ko naman nirerequire and di naman sya nahingi ng kapalit na need ko din mag update back. 

We constantly chat each other lately and napansin ko he is now using the ""we"" pronoun when talking about future plans. 
Example: ""ang cute netong outfit para sa dog natin (pertaining to his pet dog) or;
He would ask ""do you think need ko na irepaint ang house natin?"" (He lives alone) and;
""Ipapacarwash ko mamaya ang car natin""

Lastly, ilang beses nya natatanong if pasok ba sya sa standard ng lalaki na ipapakilala ko sa family ko sa future or if I want to meet his mom (his only family).

While I admit na nakakakilig, I am not believing any sweet words na sinasabi nya. Deep down, I have this gut feeling na he's too good to be true kaya lagi ako napapaisip ano yung red flag/toxic behavior nya or if may sabit ba sya.

Until then, I don't think I can make patol sa sweet efforts nya.

Previous Attempts: Ilang beses ko na sya tinatanong ng mga questions na to and he would answer:
1. Single ka ba - Oo daw because 2 jobs already keeps him busy (He have 2, yes)

2. Pero have you tried dating dati? (Impossible pag hindi kasi ampogi naman nya) - Yes daw, after he moved on from his ex, nakipag date sya pero it's either di sya bet ng babae, or di nya bet ang babae, or the vibe doesn't click. (Mind you, di nya pinipintasan ang ex nya or other girls he previously dated)

3. What are your intentions sakin? - He likes how we instantly vibed daw and proceeds to telling me the list of all my traits (and my kaitsurahan) na he likes

I have also stalked his soc meds and puro work and family posts lang andun like posts of his work achievement and pics of him, his dog and his mom.

Praning lang ba ako or I've dated too many asshats that a rare sighting of a gentleman confused me?",5,1766617405.0,adviceph,21,0.78,False
