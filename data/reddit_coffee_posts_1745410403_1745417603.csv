Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I've been tinkering in my workshop and designed a 3D-printed kit that finally makes the beautiful (but sometimes finicky) Hummingbird by Canal Portafilter play nicely with the Barista Hustle Auto Comb.

For those who've experienced the struggle of the handle not quite locking in right ‚Äì this is for you!   
My kit includes:

* A modified foot for enhanced clearance (should work with most tricky handles).
* A standard-style matching foot.
* A thicker, easier-to-grip thumb knob.

A local shop has been using this daily in production, and it's holding up great.   
They were a huge help and inspiration while prototyping.  
  
I've just listed it on Etsy and wanted to share it with the community that might find it useful.

Also, I'm curious ‚Äì what other pain points have you encountered with your coffee gear?

**Thanks to the amazing people on** r/espresso **and Youtube I** **have just had a moment of enlightenment. My very first shot pulled on my BDB using the DF54 grinder was a true 'hallelujah' moment vs the coffee beans I asked my local coffee shop to grind for me. The grinder immediately made a mind-boggling difference to my shot quality.**

**FULL STORY**

After owning a Siemens EQ.6 S700 Superauto for the last 5 years I had a moment of self-awareness a month ago where I realized I was drinking coffee that tasted like complete crap vs a coffee shop. I made a promise to myself to change that and then started researching on this sub and Youtube. My research here and on Yutube led me first to considering the Sage/Breville Touch Impress for the semi-auto convenience, and then yet more research led me to the BDB for a more customizable experience, which I found locally for 750 EUR (a returned item with full 24 month warranty). For the grinder, my research here and on Youtube led me to the DF54 as being the best in its class, so I ordered it.

However, as it would take 1.5 weeks for the DF54 to arrive, I went to a local coffee shop and asked them to finely grind me some espresso beans. I took their grind home and found that it was coarse as hell and the machine took only 10 secs to pull a shot. I returned to the shop and they put the beans through again and it was a bit finer but still took only 15 secs. Despite my several hours of research on how to dial in espresso, the best shot I pulled with it was a mere shadow of what I imagined my espresso could and should taste like.

Then today the DF54 arrived and I immediately set it up at the grind setting of 15.5 (thanks Reddit), ground the 18g of beans (only 0.1g retention and I noticed they were much finer than the aforementioned coffee shop efforts) and pulled a shot. Holy \*\*\*\*! I used 10 seconds preinfusion and then let it rip... what came out was 30 seconds of a viscous chocolately stream of liquid gold with a crema to die for. I took a sip and I was assaulted with notes of chocolate, wood and nutmeg. This is it, this was what I was hoping for, and with my first shot using the grinder!

Now in addition to further improving the quality of even that delicious espresso, I need to learn how to steam milk. I am excited at what the next days will bring. :D",1,1745417291.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Has anyone gone through the same thing?","Hi, I'm just looking for some answers. I'm 14 years old and female and have no known medical conditions, I have gotten my adenoids removed when I was younger and have hearing loss due to fluid in my left ear, just to let you know as much about me as I can. I can get 12 hours sleep and still be exhausted. If I walk for like 5 minutes or less I feel like I need to stop, my feet ache (not my shoes) I usually lean on my mothers shoulder or link someone's arm to keep going, in public at least. In school I just battle through and I don't have to walk far there anyway. It's not that I'm super unhealthy either. I have arfid so I don't always get proper nutrition but even if I eat a plate full of vegetables I still have so little energy. I'm young also and am on my screen a lot but I also read and write too, maybe do art once and a while so I have breaks. Doing those things doesn't give a noticeable difference. Idk, I have the most energy when I'm at school, even though I wake up earlier. I think it's because I know I have to get up and participate in class. On the weekends I can barely wake up. And I don't really do anything, just stay in bed because everything else would take too much out of me. I don't drink coffee but even when I do, I've never noticed having more energy. I eat a lot of sugar but I'm not obese, I'm in the normal to slightly overweight range. Probably around 65kg ish, maybe more and I'm 5 foot 5 inches. I know it's not my iron levels, I got bloods done last year and it was in the normal range but something else in my blood made it so I was prescribed tablets, I don't still take them and am not sure of the name, I have the box somewhere if you want to know. I took them consistently for months with no change. And I was low in vitamin d as my energy made it so I didn't leave the house much. I never really took the tablets consistently but I'm assuming it wouldn't make much difference either. It could possibly be my mental health because I've always had issues. I have mood swings and get ticked off easily, I have anxiety. I'm not sure about depression but I took the little question thing in the health app that told me I likely do have it. I took it again this year and it said I was better than before but still likely have it. I also could be neurodivergent and I hide how I feel till it bursts, I think ocd, my brother thinks autism. Idk. I've been seeing a councillor (several different ones) and it helps but my energy hasn't really improved so I'm inclined to think it could be medical. I should add I was walking through some hallways the past few days (they weren't too narrow but sort of were) and I felt dizzy, I never really had that symptom before. My period was consistent for over a year but then 2 cycles lasted 45 days and I missed my period for 3 months, I spotted for a few days during that time and I finally got it last week. And there's no chance I was pregnant or anything like that. I was wondering if that could have anything to do with it all. I exercise every now and again and until recently used to dance twice a week (took a 6 month break, bc burnout). I just want some answers, if anyone can tell me anything. When ever we travel my family tells me in one way or another I ruin the trip by not being able to or wanting to do much, constantly complaining I'm tired and not getting up in time for breakfast sometimes. Please if anyone can tell me what it could be I could ask my doctor about it. I got my blood taken to see if I have ovarian cysts as I missed my periods, they tested for other stuff too I think so I'll let you know when I hear back. If you need any other information I'll let you know. I was just wondering if it could be a rare condition or even non obvious symptoms of something more sinister (I'm a bit of a hypochondriac). This has all gone on for years. The mood swings probably most my life, I think it's probably separate from whatevers going on but maybe contributes.

1k5zz81,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1k5zz81/she_seemed_genuinely_interested_then_bailed_on/,"She seemed genuinely interested, then bailed on our first meeting and ghosted me. I‚Äôm confused and don‚Äôt know what to make of it. How do they do it after months of putting in genuine efforts? So difficult to let go, or should I try to confront her on a call?","*Long Post Warning! But I would really really appreciate the help. Thanks in advance!*

I (27M) matched with a girl (25F) on Instagram in 2023. We connected over music and slowly started chatting. Nothing intense at first ‚Äî just occasional convos. I was laid off in early 2024 and figuring out my next steps, while she was in Chennai for college.

In July 2024, I went to a music concert in Kolkata. She gave me her number and was genuinely excited to get the videos. That really kickstarted things. By December, we were talking regularly ‚Äî sending random cute photos (flowers, coffee, outfits, playlists), sharing little details about our lives. Nothing romantic officially, but it was sometimes flirty and mostly emotionally warm.

I moved to Bangalore for a new job while she got an internship in Gurgaon. We finally planned to meet in April 2025, when I‚Äôd be returning from Kashmir (family trip) via Delhi. I told her I‚Äôd stop in Gurgaon just to see her, and she seemed super excited ‚Äî helped pick the lunch spot, suggested we explore Delhi together, and even split the concert tickets for an artist we both adored (Rishabh Rikhiram Sharma's show on April 6th).

She was actually the one who first suggested staying the night in Delhi, probably get some drinks too ‚Äî said we could spend the day together exploring and head back to Gurgaon the next night. But later she told me it would be too expensive for her to split the hotel in Delhi. So I made the call to book a hotel in Gurgaon for just myself instead ‚Äî close to her PG, just so she'd feel safer, closer to home, and not have to travel far after work. I would just have to drop her off to her PG everyday post dinner that's literally it, which I obviously offered to do. Drinks were off the table now because of the expenses and nothing else was discussed.

I didn't have any friends/family in Gurgaon. I was taking WFH, so I kept my evenings flexible for casual dinner meetups nearby. I didn‚Äôt ask her to split the hotel cost at all ‚Äî told her I‚Äôd gotten a discount and was staying alone either way.

One memory that stuck with me ‚Äî I once told her I liked the idea of sharing a cigarette with someone I‚Äôm into, even though I don‚Äôt smoke and I knew she did. She said she‚Äôd love to share one with me someday. Small moment, but meaningful in the way you hope mutual feelings are. Assumed these are personal and people don't go about sharing these everyday.

Anyways, the concert was in April and the 3 months since January passed flawlessly over texts and calls.

I was nearing the end of my Kashmir trip now and she texted that her work has been really stressful lately and she couldn't take leave on the Monday (while I had already taken the leave). So that plan was off but Sundaying with her was still on. She mentioned that ""Lunch to show is a lot of time but okay"" - This kind of felt off as if it's another stress to add on top of her work stress. She also said that having dinner during workdays would not be possible as well because of her work lately.

Then one day prior, she texted that she would come from her relatives' directly, and there was no need for me to pick her up. Okay fine. I texted her to have something before we could meet directly in Delhi, because my hotel check in was around 12pm and I would freshen up and reach by 2pm. This was on Saturday evening around 6pm. No replies post that. My message was not even seen. Meanwhile, I was on a train from Jammu to Delhi.

It was the D-day. Reached Delhi by morning 7am. Reached hotel by 10am. Waited 2 hours in the reception to just check in. Then Checked in. Was trimming my beard and getting ready. Texted her that I would be leaving in another 15 mins and her text came in that she's not doing well since last night. No heads-up, no calls. She just said she fell really sick and couldn't inform earlier. I did see her viewing my stories at around 8:30am in the morning. Again, felt really off and I asked directly whether our evening plan was still on at least?

She said it wasn't, because she would be going to the doctor's. I kind of guessed this was going to happen. I sent her a long text explaining why the circumstances are such that I am having trust issues now. I told her gently that I felt hurt, and it seemed like she was avoiding me. I wasn‚Äôt rude ‚Äî just honest about how much effort I‚Äôd put in to make this happen. She left me on read. I felt so upset. I had nothing to do all day, no friends in Gurgaon/Delhi.

I ended up going to the concert alone and it was honestly heartbreaking. Everything there reminded me of her.

That night turned into one of the worst of my life. My phone died around 10:15 pm after the show. Couldn‚Äôt book a cab. Walked nearly 6-7 km alone across unfamiliar streets in Delhi. I asked people for help and was ignored multiple times ‚Äî even saw a woman in a parked car roll up her window when I approached just to ask for a phone charger. I eventually reached a hospital, where a kind security guard helped me charge my phone. I offered to buy him a cold drink in return, and he walked me another 20 minutes through a sketchy area. He casually pointed to one street and said it‚Äôs known as ‚ÄúChakku Para‚Äù (Knife Street) because of frequent stabbings. That hit me hard.

I finally reached my hotel at 3:30 am. Next morning, booked a flight and came back to Bangalore.

I messaged her once more that week, just to ask if she was okay and apologize if I‚Äôd said anything wrong. She left it on seen. A week later, she unfollowed me on social media ‚Äî no blocks, no words, just disappeared.

Hasn't blocked me on Whatsapp. Literally everyone around me is asking me not to call her/ping her, not confront her, she's not worth it, etc. and I have been able to control myself.

I genuinely don‚Äôt know what did I do wrong. Did she get cold feet? Was I too much? Or was it just never serious for her and I failed to read the signs? I had no hidden agenda ‚Äî I just wanted to meet someone I cared about and see where it could go.

I know I should forget about her, but I‚Äôm struggling to understand how someone can just detach like that after months of what felt like genuine connection. And coming to think of it, we started talking 2 years ago. Not even sure whether she would want a straight confrontation, after leaving everything on read. Not a single reply till date!

We didn‚Äôt have any mutual friends, so I get that it‚Äôs hard to judge someone without meeting. But that‚Äôs exactly why I planned the trip ‚Äî just to meet and see where things could go. I come from a good background, work as an SDE2 at a reputable company, earn well, pay for everything myself, and live responsibly. Her profile seemed genuine too, so I know she wasn‚Äôt fake. I‚Äôm just left wondering what went wrong ‚Äî and how she could suddenly disappear like that. Sending her photos of our BLR society garden and she replying that she's gonna invite herself over seems so fake and empty now. Still feel terrible about buying a rather costly attar for her from Srinager as a souvenir. All those emotional investment feels so useless...

In all honesty I was probably drinking more than that before I knew I was pregnant (TWW and like 4 weeks 5 days when I took the test- then nothing since).

I read so many excuses on reddit from young people about why they do not have friends or do not socialise much. I can't afford to buy a house, I don't have money for socialising, etc. They appear to be locked into an image of socialising that is about spending lots of money, or having parties at your own house.

When I was young I lived in a room that was so shitty I never had people back. And I still have very little money. But I go round friends for a coffee, go out a walk with friends, drink in the park, nurse a ¬£2 weatherspoons pint most of the night, go skinny dipping, play board games at friends houses, etc etc. Making friends and socialising has never relied on owning your own house or having much money.

## Five Scholars, One Ancient Mystery, and Zero Filter

**Authors' Note:** *The following is a fictional dialogue between five scholars with different perspectives on religious history. While historical citations are accurate, many of the connections and theories presented are speculative and do not represent mainstream academic consensus. This dialogue is presented as an exercise in historical imagination rather than established scholarship. Reader discretion‚Äîand a sense of humor‚Äîis advised.*

### PARTICIPANTS:

**Dr. Eliza Cohen** - *Professor of Comparative Religious Studies at Oxford University, known for her uncompromising approach to textual analysis and inability to suffer fools*

**Dr. Ahmed Rahman** - *Professor of Ancient Near Eastern History at the University of Chicago, renowned for his brilliant cross-cultural analyses and theatrical lecture style*

**Dr. Michael Thornton** - *Professor of Classical Studies at Princeton University, expert in Roman law who never misses an opportunity to mention his rowing days at Cambridge*

**Dr. Sofia Vasiliev** - *Professor of Biblical Archaeology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose excavation discoveries are matched only by her devastating critiques of pseudoarchaeology*

**Dr. James Washington** - *Professor of Religious Anthropology at UC Berkeley, former evangelical who now approaches religious origin stories with both personal insight and academic skepticism*

---

### DIALOGUE TRANSCRIPT
*Recorded at the International Symposium on Religious Evolution in the Ancient Mediterranean, with an open bar that proved to be a questionable decision by the organizers*

**MODERATOR:** Welcome to our panel on ""Religious Evolution in Antiquity: Fact, Fiction, and the Academically Fantastico."" I'm your moderator, and I'll be trying to prevent our distinguished scholars from committing academic homicide today. Let's begin with opening remarks.

**DR. COHEN:** *adjusting glasses* Thank you. While I appreciate the creative title of this panel, I should note that ""academically fantastico"" is not a methodological category I recognize. I specialize in Second Temple Judaism and early Christian communities, and I approach these subjects with rigorous textual analysis, not‚Äî

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *interrupting* ‚ÄîNot fun? Come on, Eliza, even Dead Sea Scrolls scholars are allowed to have personalities. Mine emerged sometime after tenure.

**DR. COHEN:** *with a thin smile* As I was saying before James decided to demonstrate why tenure shouldn't be guaranteed... Christianity emerged from Judaism, not as an externally engineered reformation project. The historical evidence simply doesn't support conspiracy theories about Roman-designed religions, no matter how many paperbacks they sell at airports.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *leaning forward dramatically* But the narrative patterns! The symbolic resonances! The absolutely fabulous parallels between cultural mythologies! *gestures expansively* While I agree with Dr. Cohen's assessment‚Äîhistorically speaking‚ÄîI find these patterns across civilizations utterly fascinating, even when they're separated by centuries.

**DR. THORNTON:** *straightening his bow tie* As someone who rowed for Cambridge‚Äî

**DR. VASILIEV:** *rolls eyes* Drink every time Michael mentions Cambridge. We'll all be unconscious before we discuss the Gospels.

**DR. THORNTON:** *clears throat* As I was saying, from a legal history perspective, Roman governance was remarkably adaptable. They couldn't care less what god you worshipped as long as you paid taxes and didn't start rebellions. Their religious tolerance was entirely pragmatic, much like my college rowing strategy‚Äî

**DR. VASILIEV:** *pretends to take a drink*

**DR. THORNTON:** *sighs* The point is, Rome wasn't in the business of engineering religions.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** Unless you count deifying emperors, which was basically the ancient equivalent of celebrity worship. ""This month in Roman Vogue: Augustus' top ten divine fashion moments!""

**MODERATOR:** Perhaps we could focus on the relationship between early Christianity and Judaism?

**DR. COHEN:** Gladly. Jesus was a Jew who lived and died as a Jew. As E.P. Sanders writes, ""Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew, and died as a Jew"" (Sanders, 1992, p.18). The earliest Jesus-followers attended Temple, observed Torah, and considered themselves part of Judaism. The break was gradual, complicated, and often painful‚Äîrather like academic department meetings.

**DR. VASILIEV:** *nods vigorously* The archaeological evidence supports this completely. Early Christian material culture is indistinguishable from Jewish material culture of the period. No separate ""Christian"" artifacts appear until much later. It's like trying to separate hipsters from artists in Brooklyn‚Äîtheoretically different groups, but they shop at the same places.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *enthusiastically* If I may offer a purely hypothetical thought experiment‚Äîand I stress this is speculative‚Äîreligious movements often simplify ritual systems when adapting to new contexts. It's like religious evolution through cultural natural selection! Complex temple sacrifices become symbolic meals. Elaborate purity laws become moral principles. The core adapts while peripheral elements fall away!

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *sipping coffee* Christianity didn't emerge pre-packaged as a ""Judaism Lite"" for Roman consumption. Having grown up evangelical before becoming a scholar, I can tell you firsthand that religious transformation is messy, personal, and rarely follows a master plan. Trust me, my parents still send me salvation pamphlets with my birthday cards.

**DR. THORNTON:** And from a governance perspective‚Äî

**DR. VASILIEV:** *whispers* Cambridge in three, two, one...

**DR. THORNTON:** *glaring at Vasiliev* As Mary Beard writes in *SPQR*, ""The Romans were generally tolerant of other religions... but they drew the line at practices that seemed to undermine the Roman social and political order"" (Beard, 2015, p.519). They were pragmatists, not theologians. Rather like university administrators.

**MODERATOR:** Let's discuss the symbolic parallels between Jewish sacrificial rituals and Christian narratives.

**DR. COHEN:** *sits up straighter* The Day of Atonement ritual with two goats‚Äîone sacrificed and one bearing sins into the wilderness‚Äîhas interesting parallels with Christian soteriology. Jacob Milgrom's monumental work on Leviticus explains how ""the scapegoat ritual symbolically removes the impurity caused by sin"" (Milgrom, 1991, p.1082). Early Christians, steeped in Jewish symbolism, naturally found meaning in these parallels.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *eyes lighting up* Symbolic transference across cultural boundaries is my jam! But suggesting Jesus and Barabbas were deliberately positioned as ritual parallels to these goats is like claiming Shakespeare wrote his plays as encoded stock tips. Creative, but utterly unhistorical.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *laughs* As my grandmother would say, ""That dog won't hunt."" Particularly since‚Äîlet me check my notes‚Äîoh yes, Islam emerged some six centuries after Christianity, making any claim about ""pre-written Islamic tribal practices"" influencing Christianity approximately as plausible as claiming Abraham Lincoln was influenced by Twitter.

**DR. VASILIEV:** *emphatically* And don't get me started on the ""Book of the Cow"" business. The Quranic Surah Al-Baqarah comes centuries later and has absolutely nothing to do with the golden calf in Exodus. This is what happens when people play historical connect-the-dots while blindfolded and spinning.

**DR. THORNTON:** The release of Barabbas is itself historically questionable. As Raymond Brown notes in his exhaustive *The Death of the Messiah*, ""There is no evidence for such a practice in contemporary Roman or Jewish sources"" (Brown, 1994, p.814). Romans weren't known for their prisoner release programs. More for their ""find creative ways to execute prisoners"" programs.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *thoughtfully* Though it's worth noting that Gospel narratives weren't primarily concerned with historical documentation as we understand it. They were theological texts written to communities facing specific challenges. Reading them as journalistic accounts misses their purpose.

**DR. COHEN:** Exactly. And regarding crucifixion terminology, the Greek *stauroo* unambiguously refers to crucifixion, not simply ""hanging from a tree."" While Deuteronomy uses tree imagery for execution, and Paul makes this connection in Galatians 3:13, this is theological interpretation, not mistranslation.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *gesturing excitedly* Linguistic precision matters enormously! You can't just play mix-and-match with terms across languages and centuries. It's like claiming ""butterfly"" and ""flutter by"" prove some ancient conspiracy because they sound similar. Language doesn't work that way!

**DR. VASILIEV:** *dryly* Unless you're writing bestselling conspiracy fiction, in which case anything goes. I once had a student claim that ""archaeology"" translates to ""fake bones"" in ancient Greek. It doesn't.

**MODERATOR:** Let's move to social dimensions like literacy and class structures.

**DR. COHEN:** Literacy rates in antiquity were abysmal by modern standards. Catherine Hezser estimates perhaps 3% of the population in Roman Palestine could read (Hezser, 2001, p.496). This created obvious power dynamics around who controlled texts and their interpretation.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *nodding* Which is why oral tradition was so crucial. Most people encountered sacred texts through hearing, not reading. Think religious podcasts before podcasts existed. The memory techniques were impressive‚Äîunlike my students who can't remember when office hours are despite sixteen reminder emails.

**DR. RAHMAN:** From a comparative perspective, this pattern of elite textual control appears across civilizations. The Latin phrase *ipsa scientia potestas est*‚Äî""knowledge itself is power""‚Äîwasn't invented for cute classroom posters. It was lived reality.

**DR. THORNTON:** Legal proceedings reflected these literacy disparities. Most people needed advocates who understood the system. When John's Gospel describes private conversations between Jesus and Pilate, it suggests something similar to what Romans called *cognitio extra ordinem*‚Äîless formal proceedings where magistrates had significant discretion.

**DR. VASILIEV:** *with passion* This is precisely why archaeological evidence is so crucial! Material culture captures aspects of life that texts‚Äîwritten by elites‚Äîoften overlook. Ordinary people left behind pottery, tools, and burial goods, not philosophical treatises.

**DR. COHEN:** Speaking of material evidence, the Gospel genealogies tracing Jesus to the tribe of Judah fulfill messianic expectations from texts like Genesis 49:10. However, suggestions that Jesus functioned like Joseph in uniting tribal lineages lacks any textual support whatsoever.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *with amusement* It's fascinating how people construct elaborate theories while ignoring simpler explanations. Occam's razor gets very dull in these discussions.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *theatrical sigh* But speculation is so tempting! Humans love pattern-finding‚Äîit's how our brains work. The challenge is distinguishing meaningful patterns from coincidental ones. I specialize in legitimate cross-cultural connections, but even I have to constantly check myself against seeing significance where there's mere coincidence.

**DR. THORNTON:** Rome did maintain multiple jurisdictional levels‚Äîlocal, provincial, imperial‚Äîwhich bears some structural similarity to modern federal systems. Anthony Birley documents this layered approach extensively (Birley, 2000). But direct influence on modern American federalism? That requires much more evidence than mere structural similarity.

**DR. VASILIEV:** *taps table for emphasis* Structure alone proves nothing. Humans independently develop similar systems for managing complexity. It's convergent cultural evolution, not evidence of direct transmission.

**MODERATOR:** As we approach our conclusion, let's address some of the more creative interpretations of these traditions.

**DR. COHEN:** *sighs deeply* The ""Holy Grail as bloodline"" concept popularized in fiction like ""The Da Vinci Code"" originated in the 20th century, not antiquity. Richard Barber's definitive work shows how grail legends evolved through medieval romance literature (Barber, 2004). It's historical fanfiction masquerading as hidden truth.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *with a laugh* As someone who studies how religious communities form their identities, I find these modern mythologies fascinating. They tell us more about contemporary anxieties than ancient realities. People want secret knowledge, hidden histories that make them special. It's spirituality with a side of exclusivity.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *enthusiastically* From a comparative mythology perspective, sacred objects often accumulate meanings across contexts. That's legitimate cultural evolution! But suggesting secret bloodlines requires evidence, not just creative connecting of unrelated dots.

**DR. THORNTON:** Regarding crucifixion practices, Roman procedures are well-documented. Martin Hengel's work shows how beating beforehand was standard (Hengel, 1977). But claims about bodies being deliberately ""beaten beyond recognition"" to hide identity? Pure speculation without primary source support.

**DR. VASILIEV:** *passionately* And this is where archaeological evidence becomes crucial! Physical remains tell us what actually happened, not what people centuries later imagined might have happened. The evidence for Roman crucifixion aligns with Gospel accounts in general terms, but provides no support for elaborate conspiracy theories.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *thoughtfully* These speculative reconstructions reveal how uncomfortable we are with historical ambiguity. We want certainty where sources provide only fragments. We want comprehensive explanations where evidence offers only glimpses.

**DR. COHEN:** *nodding* And as scholars, our job is to resist that temptation‚Äîto acknowledge gaps in our knowledge rather than filling them with unfounded speculation.

**DR. RAHMAN:** Though I would add that hypothetical thinking can be valuable when clearly labeled as such. It stimulates new questions and research directions. The danger comes when speculation is presented as established fact.

**DR. THORNTON:** *straightening papers* As I tell my students at Princeton‚Äîwho, unlike my Cambridge rowing teammates, occasionally listen‚Äîhistorical method requires discipline. Speculation without evidence isn't scholarship; it's creative writing.

**DR. VASILIEV:** *smiling* And some of us enjoy creative writing! Just not when it's masquerading as history. Save it for your novel, which‚Äîunlike your academic work‚Äîmight actually make money.

**MODERATOR:** *looking relieved* Any final thoughts before we conclude this remarkably civil discussion?

**DR. COHEN:** Serious historical inquiry distinguishes between evidence-based conclusions and speculative hypotheses. The relationship between Judaism and early Christianity deserves rigorous analysis, not sensationalist theories.

**DR. RAHMAN:** *dramatically* The past is complex enough without our embellishments! The actual patterns of religious development across cultures are more fascinating than any conspiracy theory.

**DR. WASHINGTON:** *with a smile* And remember that religious traditions are living communities, not just historical artifacts. How people find meaning in these stories matters, even as we pursue historical accuracy.

**DR. THORNTON:** Understanding political and legal contexts adds important dimensions to religious history. But as Marc Bloch warned about ""the mania for making judgments,"" we must avoid imposing modern sensibilities on ancient contexts (Bloch, 1953, p.140).

**DR. VASILIEV:** *raising coffee cup* And let's toast to evidence-based scholarship that's still passionate, engaging, and occasionally humorous. History doesn't have to be dry to be accurate!

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for this spirited discussion that somehow avoided academic bloodshed. The cash bar is now open, which I suspect will lead to even more ""spirited"" discussions.

1k5zmsl,https://i.redd.it/orcntvgaalwe1.jpeg,Please help me with my lounge/dining layout!,"Floor plan of my lounge/dining attached. The photo cuts off just before the kitchen island begins. Next to the small diagonal wall is the hallway entrance.

Currently, my TV and stand are in the far corner, between the window and sliding door, angled diagonally. I have two 2-seater couches forming a sort of L-shape (like a half-diamond) facing the TV, with a coffee table in the middle, creating a defined square ‚Äúlounge‚Äù zone.

In the top-right corner near the kitchen, I‚Äôve placed my large square dining table, but it feels a bit cramped next to the island.

To the left of the front door, I have a tall bookshelf facing diagonally and a short/wide bookshelf along the wall beside it, with a giant beanbag in front of them. This forms a cozy reading corner, but it feels a little awkward being right at the entrance.

What I‚Äôm thinking of doing:
‚Ä¢ Move the bookshelves and beanbag to the far corner where the TV and couches are now.
	
‚Ä¢ Then center the TV under the heat pump (on the wall between the window and hallway).
	
‚Ä¢ Position the couches facing each other, perpendicular to the TV (rather than angled), with the coffee table in between. That way the couches create more of a balanced conversation space, and the TV is still viewable.

‚Ä¢ This could open up access to the sliding door, make the reading nook more buried into the room, and free up space near the dining area, so I can move the dining table a bit away from the kitchen island. 

Wondering everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this plan? Thoughts on having the couches face each other rather than the TV? I‚Äôm telling myself it‚Äôll be fine because if we want to watch tv we can just sit in an angle or lay down - but if anyone has tried this and hated it i‚Äôd love to know! Im hesitant to L shape the couches if they‚Äôre closer to the middle of the room because it feels like one of them would impede too much on the direct walking space from the front door. I‚Äôm also not used to having the main sitting area be so close to the door, feels like I would feel on edge or somehow exposed? Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated!

I know Reddit‚Äôs not always the easiest place to find something real, but figured I‚Äôd put this out there for the people looking for a bit more than the standard experience with these things.



I‚Äôm 28, based in the UK. Not expecting immediate replies; life gets busy. But it‚Äôd be great to find something that flows. Something genuine, and maybe even something we actually look forward to. Low-key rare these days, I feel.



I read a lot. Mostly fiction, especially after work when I just wanna switch off and drift into another world. Keep meaning to get back into reading history, but I‚Äôve been saying that for ages now. Still waiting on it to happen. üòÄ

That said, I‚Äôm as enamoured with Sabaton as ever, so my interest in history is still alive and kicking. If you‚Äôre into unique genre interpretations, interested in history, or just like great music, I‚Äôd thoroughly recommend them.



Currently working through a bit of a guilty pleasure read. If you‚Äôre curious, feel free to ask. I might tell you, if you ask nicely. Or take a guess if you‚Äôre feeling bold. Got one of your own? Book, film, playlist?



I got into running pretty impulsively and now I seem to have joined the running cult. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta. But I‚Äôm most definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. My feed is mostly race clips, questionable running tips, and scenic routes I‚Äôd love to try, ideally ones that end with good coffee.



I‚Äôve said a fair bit about me, but honestly love getting to know people, the small things, the deep things, the random in-between bits that make someone them. I genuinely enjoy listening and learning about people beyond the surface. That‚Äôs the kind of connection I‚Äôm most drawn to.



If you‚Äôre into books, running, voice notes, late-night tangents, the kind of chats that start off light and, before you know it, end somewhere unexpectedly lovely, or you‚Äôre up for building a connection with someone equally invested in doing so, say hi. I‚Äôm always up for proper conversation, whether it leads to a solid friendship or something with a bit of spark.



If you‚Äôve got a book or series that will completely consume me, or running tips which don‚Äôt involve building a shoe rotation worth the moon, I‚Äôm all ears.

Getting your small business noticed doesn't always mean shouting the loudest or spending the most. Often, the most impactful connections happen right in your own neighborhood. For small businesses, focusing your marketing efforts locally isn't just a suggestion; it's frequently the smartest path to steady growth. Think about it ‚Äì your most likely customers are the people living, working, and playing nearby. Effective **small business marketing** taps into this local pulse.

Connecting with your nearby audience builds something more lasting than just a quick sale; it builds community and loyalty. People genuinely like supporting businesses they feel connected to, places that are part of their daily lives. What‚Äôs great is that many powerful **local marketing tactics** don't demand giant budgets. With some focused effort, you can make a real difference, drawing in customers and becoming a valued local presence. Let‚Äôs look at 21 practical ways to do just that.

# Build and Optimize Local Business Listings

Before customers can choose you, they need to find you online, accurately. This is where **local business listings** are absolutely fundamental. Consider these your essential online signposts. Making sure your information is correct and consistent across key platforms is step one for successful **small business marketing**.

Focus on the main players first: Google Business Profile, Yelp, and Bing Places for Business. Setting up profiles here is usually free and incredibly beneficial. The name of the game is consistency. Your business name, address, phone number (often called NAP), website, and opening hours must match *exactly* everywhere online. Small differences can confuse search engines and customers alike.

Here‚Äôs how to get it right:

* Find your business on these sites. If a listing exists, claim it as yours. If not, create one.
* Fill out every section possible. Add photos, a detailed description of what you do, services offered, payment types accepted ‚Äì everything. More information helps customers and search engines.
* Keep everything current. Change your hours? Add a new service? Update your listings right away. An outdated listing leads to frustrated potential customers.

Well-managed **local business listings** dramatically boost your online visibility, making it simpler for local searchers to find you exactly when they need what you offer.

# Focus on Local SEO

Search Engine Optimization might sound like a big, complex thing, but **local SEO** boils down to helping people in your specific geographic area find your business when they search online. Think about searches like ""coffee shop near me"" or ""best plumber in \[Your Town\]."" **Local SEO** helps your business appear in those results. For any modern **small business marketing** plan, this is non-negotiable.

Here are practical steps for **local SEO**:

* Supercharge Your Google Business Profile: This is your local powerhouse. Complete every section, encourage **customer reviews**, add photos often, answer questions in the Q&A feature, and post updates. Google likes active profiles.
* Use Location-Based Keywords Naturally: Sprinkle your city, neighborhood, or service area into your website's content. Think page titles, headings, service descriptions. Examples: ""Downtown \[Your City\] bookstore"" or ""Emergency roof repair in \[Your County\].""
* Build Local Links: Get links pointing to your website from other respected local sources. This could be the Chamber of Commerce, neighborhood associations, local bloggers, or event pages where you're a sponsor. These local signals prove your relevance to the area.
* Make Sure Your Website Works on Phones: A lot of local searches happen on the go. Your site needs to load fast and look good on mobile screens.

Good **local SEO** improves your ranking in local search results, including Google Maps, guiding nearby customers straight to your door or website.

# Leverage Customer Reviews

Your reputation in the local community is gold. **Customer reviews** are today's word-of-mouth, and they heavily influence potential customers. Most people check online reviews before trying a new local spot or service. Positive feedback builds immense trust and shows others that your business is reliable and offers value.

Getting more **customer reviews** doesn't mean begging. It's about making it straightforward for happy clients to share their thoughts. Try these approaches:

* Just Ask: When a customer seems pleased, simply ask if they‚Äôd consider leaving a review. You can mention it at the point of sale, in a follow-up email, or even with a small sign.
* Provide Direct Links: Make it incredibly simple. Add links to your Google, Yelp, or other relevant review site profiles on your website, in your email signature, or even on receipts.
* Respond to All Reviews: Keep an eye on your review pages and respond to feedback ‚Äì positive and negative. Thank people for good reviews. Address negative reviews calmly and politely. Acknowledge the issue, apologize if needed, and offer to resolve it offline. Your public responses show you care.

Actively managing and encouraging **customer reviews** is a low-cost, high-impact **local marketing tactic** to build credibility and attract discerning local customers.

# Invest in Local Advertising

While building your online presence organically takes time, paid **local advertising** can give you an immediate visibility boost and reach a precisely targeted audience. Online ad platforms let you target based on location, interests, and online behavior, making your ad budget work much harder than traditional, broader advertising methods.

Consider these effective **local advertising** options:

* Social Media Ads: Facebook and Instagram offer amazing targeting. Show ads only to people within a specific radius of your shop, target users interested in things related to your business (like ""gardening"" if you own a nursery), or even reach people near specific life events.
* Google Ads (Local Campaigns): Google lets you run campaigns focused on driving in-store visits or local actions like phone calls or map direction requests. You target specific areas, appearing when locals search for relevant terms. You only pay when someone actually clicks your ad.
* Geotargeted Display Ads: These are visual banner ads shown on websites and apps, but *only* to users located within a geographic area you define. This helps build local brand awareness.

Make your ad messages relevant. Speak to the local audience, maybe reference local points of interest or offer deals exclusive to residents. Smart **local advertising** puts your message right in front of the people most likely to buy from you.

# Create Hyper-Targeted Local Content Marketing

Content marketing isn't just for big national brands. **Local content marketing** means creating useful, interesting content specifically for people in your community. Instead of writing about general topics, you focus on things relevant to local life. This establishes you as a helpful resource, boosts your **local SEO**, and creates a stronger bond with potential customers.

What kind of local content can you create?

* Blog posts about upcoming local festivals, farmers' market tips, or neighborhood guides.
* Interviews with other local business owners or community leaders.
* Guides specific to your area, like ""Best Hiking Trails near \[Your Town\]"" (if you sell outdoor gear) or ""Tips for Starting a Community Garden in \[Your City\]"" (if you own a garden center).
* Stories featuring local customers (get their permission!) or highlighting community projects your business supports.
* Behind-the-scenes looks at your business, introducing your team (who are probably locals too!) or sharing your origin story.

Use storytelling that connects with the local spirit. When your content reflects and celebrates your area, it naturally attracts people who care about the community, making your **small business marketing** feel more authentic and effective. Sprinkle in local keywords to help people find it via search!

# Use Social Media for Local Engagement

Social media is fantastic for small businesses, not just to post announcements, but to genuinely connect with the local community. It's where conversations are already happening. Being an active participant builds relationships and makes your business more visible and approachable. Facebook, Instagram, and even platforms like Twitter or Nextdoor can be great for local connection.

Here's how to use social media effectively locally:

* Join Relevant Local Groups: Find Facebook groups for your town, neighborhood activities, or shared interests. Participate by offering helpful advice or sharing interesting local news (not just constant self-promotion). Become a known, helpful voice.
* Run Fun Local Contests: Offer prizes that appeal specifically to locals, like a gift basket from your shop or tickets to a community theatre show. Encourage sharing and tagging friends for wider reach.
* Use Location Features: Always tag your business location in posts (geotagging). Use popular local hashtags (#YourCityName #YourNeighborhood #\[YourCity\]Events) so people searching for local content can find you.
* Interact Quickly: Respond to comments and direct messages personally and without long delays. Ask questions in your posts to get conversations started. Share photos customers tag you in (ask permission!).
* Showcase Your Community Involvement: Post photos if your team volunteers locally or if you're participating in a town event.

Genuine interaction shows you're invested in the community beyond just sales. It helps build a loyal following that translates into real business.

# Collaborate with Other Local Businesses

Teaming up with other non-competing local businesses is a really smart **small business marketing** move. By sharing audiences and resources, you can reach more potential customers, build goodwill, and strengthen the local economy together. It‚Äôs all about mutual support.

Ideas for local collaborations:

* Host a Joint Event: Partner with a complementary business for a workshop, customer appreciation night, or seasonal sale. A boutique and a salon could host a ""Style Night Out.""
* Offer a Joint Promotion: Create a package deal. A local brewery and a pizza place could offer a discount when items from both are purchased together.
* Cross-Promote Each Other: Simply agree to recommend each other. Keep a stack of their business cards at your counter and vice-versa. Feature each other on social media or in email newsletters.
* Bundle Products or Services: A bookstore and a cafe could offer a ""Book & Brew"" combo.
* Share Costs: Maybe you can split the cost of an ad in the local paper or share a booth at a community fair.

Look for businesses whose customers might also be interested in what you offer, but who aren't direct competitors. These local partnerships expand your reach through trusted introductions.

# Host Community Events

Bringing people together in person is a wonderful way to build your brand and connect with locals on a deeper level. Hosting events ‚Äì small or large ‚Äì lets people experience your business's personality, meet you and your team, and feel more connected. It positions you as an active community hub.

Event ideas to consider:

* Workshops or Classes: Share your knowledge. A craft store could host a knitting circle, a tech shop could offer a smartphone basics class for seniors.
* Customer Appreciation Gatherings: An informal open house with some snacks and maybe a special discount can go a long way in thanking loyal patrons.
* Charity Events: Partner with a local non-profit to host a donation drive or fundraiser. It shows you care and attracts people who support that cause.
* Pop-Ups: If you're mainly online or want to test a new location, set up a temporary shop in a shared space or another business.
* Seasonal Celebrations: Host a small back-to-school event, a holiday craft fair, or a summer sidewalk sale.

Don't forget to promote your event! Announce it on your **local business listings** (Google has an events feature!), social media, email, in-store signs, and reach out to local community calendars. That face-to-face interaction builds lasting loyalty.

# Engage with Local Influencers

You don't need celebrity endorsements. Partnering with *local* influencers ‚Äì people with a trusted voice and engaged following right in your area ‚Äì can be very effective. These could be local bloggers, popular Instagrammers known for covering your town, community figures, or simply well-regarded residents.

How to work with local influencers:

* Find the Right Fit: Look for people whose audience matches yours and whose content aligns with your brand's vibe. Micro-influencers (with smaller, highly engaged local followings) are often perfect. Check local hashtags or see who your target customers follow.
* Build a Relationship First: Follow them, interact with their posts genuinely. Understand their style before pitching a collaboration.
* Offer Something of Value: Maybe send a product for review, offer a free service, pay for a sponsored post featuring your business, or invite them to an exclusive preview event.
* Be Clear: Outline expectations for the collaboration. Make sure they know about proper disclosure rules (like using #ad).
* See What Happens: Track engagement on their posts, use special discount codes to measure referrals, and ask new customers how they heard about you.

Authentic partnerships with local voices can introduce your business to a relevant audience in a trustworthy way, boosting your **small business marketing** efforts.

# Run Local Promotions and Discounts

Special offers exclusively for locals are a tried-and-true way to drive visits, encourage quick purchases, and reward loyalty. These promotions make residents feel appreciated and give them a clear reason to choose you over less community-focused options.

Local promotion ideas:

* Neighborhood Discount: Offer a small percentage off for customers showing proof of residence in a specific zip code.
* Local Loyalty Card: A simple ""buy 10 get 1 free"" punch card or a digital version works wonders for repeat business.
* ""Local Heroes"" Offer: A standing discount for local teachers, first responders, or military personnel shows community support.
* Tie-in with Local Events: Offer a discount to anyone showing a ticket stub from the local high school play that weekend.
* Partner Discount: Arrange reciprocal discounts with another local business.

Promote these offers clearly! Use **local advertising** (like geo-targeted social ads), post them on social media, highlight them in emails, use in-store signage, and add them to the ""Offers"" section of your Google Business Profile. These incentives directly encourage local shopping.

# Sponsor Local Events or Organizations

Putting your business name on a local Little League team's jerseys, sponsoring a school fun run, or supporting a community arts festival is a great way to increase visibility and show you're invested in the area. Sponsorship associates your brand with positive local activities.

Tips for effective sponsorship:

* Choose Wisely: Pick opportunities that align with your brand values and the interests of your target customers. A pet store might sponsor the local animal shelter's adoption event.
* Know What You Get: Understand the visibility offered ‚Äì logo placement, mentions, booth space, etc.
* Start Where You're Comfortable: You don't have to sponsor the biggest event. Supporting a smaller neighborhood gathering can still provide excellent targeted exposure.
* Activate Your Sponsorship: Promote the fact that you're a sponsor on your own channels. Attend the event if possible. Maybe offer a special discount related to the sponsorship.
* Build the Relationship: Treat it as more than just a transaction. Connect with the organization you're supporting.

Local sponsorships build recognition and goodwill, showing everyone you're a committed part of the community fabric.

# Optimize for Voice Search

How people search is changing, with voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant becoming more popular for finding local information. People ask things like, ""Hey Siri, find an open pizza place near me."" Making sure your business information is accessible via voice search is an increasingly important part of **local SEO**.

How to optimize for voice:

* Use Conversational Language: People ask questions naturally. Structure some website content (like an FAQ page) to directly answer common questions (""What are your hours on Sunday?"").
* Nail Your **Local Business Listings**: Voice assistants pull heavily from Google Business Profile, Yelp, etc., for address, hours, and phone number. Accuracy here is vital (see point #2).
* Think Long-Tail Keywords: Voice searches are often longer questions. Include these natural phrases in your website text.
* Encourage **Customer Reviews**: Voice search often favors highly-rated businesses. Good reviews help!
* Ensure Your Site is Fast: Quick answers are preferred in voice search. A fast-loading, mobile-friendly website is necessary.

Optimizing for voice makes it easier for customers using this technology to find you quickly when they need local products or services.

# Use Geotargeted Email Marketing

Email is still a fantastic way to keep in touch with customers. For local businesses, making it location-specific makes it even better. Segmenting your email list by where subscribers live lets you send super-relevant messages, offers, and news.

Tips for geotargeted emails:

* Collect Location Info (With Permission): Add an optional city/zip code field to your signup form. Explain you'll use it for local specials.
* Segment Your Audience: Use your email software to group subscribers by area (e.g., specific towns, within X miles of your store).
* Send Localized Content: Feature promotions for a specific branch, announce participation in a local event, share news relevant only to that area, or highlight local customer stories.
* Combine Data: Mix location with purchase history for even more personalized offers.

Generic emails get ignored. Geotargeted ones feel personal and valuable, strengthening local connections and prompting action. It‚Äôs a smart **local marketing tactic** for nurturing relationships.

# Place Signage and Flyers Strategically

Don't forget the power of physical marketing in your local area. Good signs, visible banners, and informative flyers placed in the right spots can grab attention effectively.

Ideas for physical marketing:

* Clear Storefront Signage: Your main sign needs to be easily read. Consider window displays or sidewalk A-frames too.
* Flyer Distribution: Ask permission to leave flyers at complementary local businesses, community centers, libraries, or coffee shops. Make them look good and easy to read.
* Event Banners: If sponsoring or participating in an event, use banners for visibility.
* Vehicle Branding: If you have company vehicles, wraps or magnets turn them into moving ads around town.

These materials should look consistent with your online branding. While digital reach is wide, physical marketing provides tangible local reminders of your business.

# Engage with Local Media

Getting mentioned in the local newspaper, on a local radio show, or featured on a popular town blog can lend serious credibility to your small business. Earned media coverage often feels more trustworthy to locals than paid ads.

How to connect with local media:

* Know Your Outlets: Identify local papers, stations, or blogs that cover business or community news relevant to you. Find specific reporter names if possible.
* Have a Real Story: Media need newsworthy angles, not just ads. Think grand openings, unique events, major milestones, significant charity partnerships, or relevant expert commentary.
* Craft a Clear Pitch: Write a brief email or press release explaining the story and its local relevance. Get straight to the point.
* Build Connections: Follow local journalists online. Offer yourself as a source for future stories in your area of expertise.
* Be Ready to Respond: If they contact you, reply quickly and be helpful.

Positive local press can significantly elevate your reputation and reach many people in the community.

# Create Location-Specific Landing Pages

If you serve multiple towns or have several locations, create separate pages on your website for each one. This is great for **local SEO** and makes things much clearer for customers.

Why dedicated pages help:

* Boosts **Local SEO**: Optimize each page for keywords specific to that location (e.g., ""Hair salon \[Town Name\]"").
* Better Experience: Visitors find the right address, local phone number, hours, and services for *their* location instantly.
* Tailored Content: Feature local staff photos, testimonials from nearby customers, or mentions of local involvement for that specific area.
* More Conversions: Relevant info leads to more calls, direction requests, or form fills.

Make sure each page has unique content beyond just the city name. Include a map, specific contact details, and perhaps local reviews. These pages improve visibility in location-specific searches.

# Offer Local Delivery or Pickup Options

Making it easy for locals to get your products is a huge plus. Offering delivery within a certain radius or convenient curbside pickup can attract more business and offer a level of service some competitors might lack.

Benefits of delivery/pickup:

* Supreme Convenience: Caters to busy people, those with limited mobility, or anyone who just prefers it.
* Stand Out: Differentiates you from businesses requiring in-person shopping only.
* Wider Local Reach: Serve customers in your delivery zone who might not visit otherwise.
* Attracts Seekers: Some customers specifically look for businesses offering these options.

How to promote it:

* Be Clear: Define delivery zones, fees, or pickup procedures.
* Promote Everywhere: Mention it on your website header, product pages, **local business listings**, social media, emails, and in **local advertising**.
* Make it Work Smoothly: Train staff on the process for a good experience.

Convenience is king. Offering these options makes it easier for locals to choose you.

# Monitor Local Competitors

Knowing what other local businesses in your field are doing is smart **small business marketing**. It helps you spot trends, identify opportunities, understand what local customers value, and find ways to make your own business stand out.

Things to observe:

* Their Online Activity: Check their website, social media, and **local business listings**. What are they posting? How are they interacting?
* **Local SEO** Performance: How do they rank for key local search terms?
* **Customer Reviews**: Read their reviews. What do people love? What are the common complaints? This reveals customer priorities.
* Offers and Pricing: Are they running local specials? How do their prices compare?
* **Local Advertising**: Do you see their ads online locally? What's their message?
* Community Presence: Are they involved in local sponsorships or events?

Use this info to sharpen your own strategy. Maybe you see a service gap you can fill or a way to offer better value. Staying aware of the local competition helps you compete effectively.

# Use Geofencing Technology

Geofencing creates a virtual boundary around a real-world location. When someone with a smartphone enters or leaves that zone, it can trigger an action, like sending them a targeted mobile ad (if they've opted into location services/ads). It‚Äôs a sophisticated way to reach people *exactly* when they are nearby.

Examples:

* A cafe could send a ""Coffee break?"" notification to people walking past during morning commute hours.
* A retail shop could target users near a competitor's store with a special offer.
* A service business could target ads to homeowners in a neighborhood where they're currently working.

This type of **local advertising** is hyper-precise and timely, potentially driving immediate foot traffic. It usually involves working with a specialized ad platform but offers unmatched location targeting.

# Encourage Word-of-Mouth Referrals

Even with all the tech, a personal recommendation from a friend or neighbor is incredibly powerful. Happy customers telling others about your business is perhaps the best form of **local marketing tactic** there is. Actively encouraging these referrals is key.

Ways to foster word-of-mouth:

* Deliver Amazing Experiences: Happy customers are the starting point. Consistently provide great service and quality.
* Gently Ask: Ask loyal customers if they know anyone who could use your services.
* Start a Referral Program: Offer a small reward (discount, gift) to both the referrer and the new customer. Keep it simple.
* Make Sharing Simple: Have easily shareable info like a digital card or referral link.
* Amplify Online Buzz: Positive online reviews and active social engagement can spark offline conversations.

Nurturing word-of-mouth relies on excellent customer experiences and making it rewarding for people to spread the word.

# Closing Thoughts

Growing your small business locally is achievable through consistent, focused effort using the right **local marketing tactics**. From optimizing your digital footprint with accurate **local business listings** and smart **local SEO**, to building real-world connections via community engagement and excellent **customer reviews**, each strategy helps you connect with your neighbors.

Don't try to do everything at once. Build a strong foundation, perhaps starting with your online listings and asking for reviews, then add other approaches like **local content marketing** or targeted **local advertising**. The heart of successful **small business marketing** lies in truly knowing, serving, and connecting with your local audience. Engage consistently, provide value, and watch your community presence grow.

1k5zcan,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1k5zcan/i_just_realized_my_teenage_therapist_wanted_to/,I just realized my teenage therapist wanted to sleep with me.,"I saw a male therapist for years as a teenager that really helped me through a bad time. Eventually he told me he had to stop seeing me because he cared about me too much and thought I would benefit from a female therapist. We hugged in the parking lot after our last session.

I looked him up a few years later as an adult and emailed him asking if I could be his patient again. He saw me once at his new practice, for free. 

I emailed him after that asking to be a patient and he said he wasn‚Äôt able to but would love to see me personally for a coffee. 

 Just now putting all the pieces together and I feel like I‚Äôve been punched in the gut. I remembered the one time as a teen I was wearing a lacy tank top and he commented on me having my bra showing and I realized how strange that is now and then it all kind of came together in my head. I told my therapist friend and she advised that no, this doesn‚Äôt sound normal. 

I held this man in very high regard. I even thought I might invite him to my wedding if I ever got married. So to realize now he was likely attracted to me as a teenager and then was trying to pursue me as an adult is‚Ä¶ rough. ",0,1745415355.0,therapy,2,0.5,False

Jason had insisted on giving Vai and Trandrai three days to plan and prepare the party they wanted to throw him, and he figured that was the right call.  The fire crackled merrily in the ring of stones casting a flickering orange light across the faces of his companions as they watched the pale flames dancing within.  A thick cut of meat turned on a wooden spit beside the fire under the attentive care of Vincent, who claimed to actually be decent at this kind of cooking, and from the care the man took in basting the roast with its own drippings, Jason could believe it.  That, and the smell wafting over to where he sat was as enchanting as the flames of the fire.  Jason found an easy smile at rest on his face as he stretched his hands toward the warmth to look over the other children.  Vai had an anticipatory joy in her very being, right down to her fidgeting, bouncing posture, whereas Trandrai had a more even excitement, Cadet wore curiosity in his peering glances at the other children, and Isis-Magdalene's sanguine visage betrayed a pensive melancholy held at bay by the feel of the moment.   
 
This, this was a little slice of normal.  A little piece of the good life dragged into the wild by the will of civilized people, a reminder that they were on their way to home and victory.  At least, that's what Jason thought about it. 
 
There had been chatter, mainly about how the fire was built, why Jason had chosen the stones he had, the methods that Vincent was employing in his cooking, and some gentle prodding by Vai and Trandrai toward Isis-Magdaline about how she liked her sewing machine and what she'd been working on.  Chatter which fell silent as twilight faded, and the stars shone in the night sky above them as if everyone understood that something was happening.  However, Cadet broke the silence by asking, ""So how do Terrans celebrate their hatch day?"" 
 
Jason sniggered a little before he answered lightly, ""Well, lots of different ways.  Some people throw big parties with games and entertainment and lots of presents, some people have a nice dinner with just a few friends and family, and all sorts of different things in between.  Usually there's cake though."" 
 
""Oh,"" Cadet said brightly, ""I guess that makes sense.  Back in Greatest of Cities all Other Cities are Less Good other kids did a lot of different things, so Terrans are kind of like us that way, huh?"" 
 
""Terrans aren't as crazy as our general reputation would have you believe,"" Vincent gruffly gruunted. 
 
""Solo pirate hunter,"" Trandrai pointed out to a round of giggling at the old man's exasperated expense. 
 
""Well, back on Manatee Paradise, the Terrans I knew were all normal.  Like, I mean, none of my friends went on crazy adventures fighting pirates or finding treasures or discovering lost ruins or anything, except in games,"" Vai helpfully pointed out, ""not even any of the grown-ups did things like that.  Well, maybe if they were veterans they'd done something."" 
 
""We do have a reputation, and maybe we deserve a little of it,"" Jason said pensively, ""I hope  deserve the nice parts of it."" 
 
""Is it not a tradition amongst Terrans to give the one being celebrated gifts upon the birthday?"" Isis-Magdalene asked quietly. 
 
""Aye, it is,"" Jason answered, ""but traditions sometimes have to bend to reality."" 
 
""As for that,"" Vincent said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a hunting knife in a worn leather sheath and a carved deer horn scale handle, ""I think... Chief you should get a birthday present.  I know that your family follows some Star Sailor traditions despite being Terrans... and uh... as I understand things Halfway is an important birthday..."" Vincent gulped, took a deep breath and extended the knife's handle toward Jason and said, ""I let you borrow this a couple of times, but now I want you to have it.  My friend forged the blade from an old leaf spring, my wife stitched that sheath herself, and Cal took down the buck I carved those scales from.  It was Cal's knife, and now-"" 
 
Jason took the knife as whatever Vincent had wanted to say caught in his throat, and he himself had to choke out, ""Thank... thank you, Uncle Vincent.  This is... this is something to be responsible for..."" 
 
""Would that I had such a thing to give,"" Isis-Magdalene somberly sighed, ""yet from the diligent labors of one Trandrai I did make this for you, and should you permit it, I shall stitch it upon your coat.""  Jason swallowed the lump in his throat and clutched Cal's old knife to his chest as he looked up to see a swatch of dark fabric in the girl's cupped sanguine hands, held out to him like an offering.   In the flickering firelight beneath the stars, Jason could see three downward pale blue chevrons nested together, with a shallow arch across the legs of the top chevron all stitched to the dark blue, nearly black swatch with white thread.  ""I first wished to use a yellow, to more closely match Terran naval traditions, but Trandrai told me such was not appropriate."" 
 
Jason reached out with trembling hands and plucked the Chief's rank insignia from her cupped hands and gently drew it close to himself, and managed against all odds to choke out thickly, ""Thank you."" 
 
""I didn't get you anything,"" Cadet blurted out, the beginnings of anger and self-reproach tinging his voice, 
 
""I thought you said you figured it out,"" Jason laughed, mainly to keep a grateful sob from escaping his chest as he flung an arm around the other boy and drew him into an embrace.  Trandrai soon found herself in Jason's startlingly strong embrace on his other side as he said, ""Just being with family after all that's happened is more than I could ask for.  Thank you, all of you."" 
 
Jason was too busy hugging his cousins to fend off his uncle's hand ruffling his hair as the old man said to him, ""Well, there's still a dinner to share."" 
 
""And cake!"" Vai interjected as she flung her diminutive form into Jason's middle and wrapped her short arms as far around him as they could go, ""Tran and I made you a cake."" 
 
""We couldn't find a good substitute for candles though,"" Trandrai admitted, ""I did consider twigs, but Via thought they might ruin the taste of the frosting we managed to make. 
 
Jason relinquished his embrace on his two cousins, one from traditional and the other adopted of his volition, and gave Vai a hug saying, ""Aye, a meal and cake.  And songs and stories and whatever else that's fun that we can think up under the stars!""  and with that, he began singing ""*Lost, lost, the boys they lost it all, lost, lost world and hearth and kin, lost, lost they heard the call, lost, lost the Lost Boys fought to win.  Through it all, they weren't brought low, and now no matter where we should go, we boys who follow after all do know, those before faced a greater foe.  Lost, lost, boys bore the weight of men, lost, lost, they sought not comfort and care, lost, lost, the wished to join the battle that'd began, lost, lost, despite that they'd all seen beyond their share.  Through it all, they weren't brought low, and now no matter where we should go, we boys who follow after all do know, those before faced a greater foe.  Lost, lost, wounded brothers thought safe behind, lost, lost, those who knew better did commit the sin, lost, lost, the Lost Boys did as must be done where fallen brothers were found, lost, lost, then their wrath did begin.  Through it all, they weren't brought low, and now no matter where we should go, we boys who follow after all do know, those before faced a greater foe.  Lost, lost, 'twas more than ought be done, lost, lost, though victory was theirs still they paid, lost, lost, though no more had died of them there were none, lost, lost, until home again their youngest one made. Through it all, they weren't brought low, and now no matter where we should go, we boys who follow after all do know, those before faced a greater foe.*"" 
 
That was hardly the end of the songs, and for the most part, they leaned more toward sailing than martial.  ""Santiana,"" in Quebequa of course, and *Roll my Bully Boys, Roll,* and of course, *The Cumberland's Crew* featured, but so too did *Hearts Among the Stars,* *The Tides Shall Bring Us Together Once Again,* and an old stand-by, *I Sail for I am a Sailor.*  Then, of course, *Happy Birthday,* which was accompanied with a leaning cake made of layered pancakes. 
 
All-in-all, by the time, Jason found himself in his bed, despite not being quite able to recall folding it down and making it up, he thought that the party had been a roaring success.  Not in the least because his own spirits had been lifted beyond what he'd dared hope for. 
 
Vincent finished tucking in the George boy with a sigh.  He thought to himself about the perils of light and joy, as a wash of old memories long suppressed of birthday parties and late-night tuck-ins, and long chats by the wood-burner while winter howled outside.  No hooch to chase the memories away, and despite the sorrow they brought, he wasn't sure he'd want to anyway.  Somehow, the old memories and the pining for what could have been, what was taken away, mingled with the pleasure and joy of the day to make what was new all the more poignant. Sometimes, there's enough light to see by, after all, and sometimes pain isn't the worst thing in the world. 
 
Before slumber dragged Vincent into dreams troubled by grief and joy both, he said a prayer for the children in his care, or at least he mumbled something prayer-like.  Chief in his thoughts were to keep the George boy's childhood intact by some divine miracle despite all the poor kid had seen and done.  Not far behind was to keep the whole lot of them safe, and after that was to keep the ship that the kids loved from harm.  After all that, he wondered if God could spare a little help for himself, mainly to not let Cadet down. 
 
Vincent awoke early in the morning, by his ship's clock anyway, by the alien planet's sun, it was late in the morning, nearly noon.  What passed for noon on such a planet, anyway.  It didn't matter much to him, what mattered to Vincent was dragging himself through his hygiene routine to get to the prize of coffee in the galley, where no doubt, the kids were already up and active.  Children, as he knew well, had little to no regard for the simple pleasure of sleeping late.  Then again, the boys didn't exactly have their own room to laze abed in. 
 
Whatever the reason, Vincent was grateful to have the table to sit at, and a mug of steaming black coffee waiting for him as he took his seat.  While the kids didn't exactly give him peace and quiet, meaning they discussed their opinions on various media as if he wasn't there, none of them interfered with the coffee's work in bringing Vincent around to full wakefulness.  Then again, Vincent couldn‚Äôt follow what in the name of goodness they were talking about even then.  He found himself complaining in his own head about kids these days, and rebuked himself as sounding like an old man.  Which he retorted to himself that he was an old man, and at that moment he decided that holding a silent argument in his own mind wouldn't be a fruitful use of his time.  ""This place seems pretty sparse,"" Vincent began abruptly, ""but I think we'd better try to find any supplies while we can.  I'd like to try for another two week trip through hyper."" 
 
""Alright,"" the George boy said, ""You got a plan?"" 
 
""Yeah, I'll take Cadet and Tran out toward the woods, and you can go along the river with Vai and Isis-Magdalene along the river, and we meet up again by sunset.  Maybe we wait for the sun to come up and try again."" 
 
""Sounds good to me,"" Jason said. 
 
So one gearing up later, and Vincent crossed the open green with Trandrai following closely behind, and Cadet soaring in wide looping circles above.  His companions didn't mind the quiet and were too far away to talk, respectively, so Vincent put some effort into *listening* for strange or unusual sounds.  Wind across the turf, the squealing buzz of something like insects.  Nothing much in the way of potential prey. 
 
Still, when they stepped below the twisting and windswept branches of the woods, and Cadet was forced to take short, gliding flights between branches overhead, he could hear nothing besides the wind in the branches and the calls of creatures too small for the crew to consider game.  The hours went by, and the sun began to dip low in the alien sky.  Life was good. 
 
The broad, placid river gently lapped the banks as Jason walked along it and scanned the rolling horizon from below.  Vai was alternately below and skimming the surface of the water, collecting a native freshwater mollusk while occasionally bemoaning the lack of any vertebrate fish swimming in that particular river.  Isis-Magdalene had insisted on carrying the collected shellfish in a tote that they'd found aboard *The Long Way,* and had the good sense to wear a dress that looked to be made out of some kind of durable fabric.  Jason figured that baby steps toward sense were good enough, seeing as how trousers would've made more sense on account of how she still had to daintily pick her way across the pebbly river bank to keep from tripping.  Leaving aristocrats and how they made even less sense than regular girls aside for the moment, Jason adjusted the strap of the RNI surplus shotgun on his shoulder and checked the sky. 
 
A half moment of thought later, and Jason nodded to himself and called to Vai when she surfaced for breath, ""Hey, come here for a sec!""  He waited there feeling Isis-Magdalene's eyes on him.  He didn't much like that.  He tried to put that feeling aside as he told Vai, ""Let's just see what's around this next bend, then start heading back.  It's getting late."" 
 
""Okay, Chief,"" the young girl agreed cheerily before twisting in a summersaulting dive to rocket off just beneath the water's surface. 
 
""You carry this well,"" Isis-Magdalene said seriously. 
 
""I don't know what you mean,"" Jason said as he strode along the stream. 
 
""I mean... she has an expectation of you, such an expectation I am being trained to carry.""  At that, Jason looked over his shoulder to raise a skeptical eyebrow at Isis-Magdalene that she met by saying, ""I do not mean that you are like our people's nobility as you might see them.  I speak only of how she expects you to decide things, and decide them well.  You carry this weight well."" 
 
""I do my best,"" Jason muttered, and tried to shrug the complement away. 
 
The pebbles ground against each other underfoot as a silence fell between the pair until she said, ""You dislike my words."" 
 
Jason shifted the weight of the shotgun on its strap again before he said, ""I'm not very good with... you know..."" 
 
""Compliments?  Why not?"" 
 
""Dunno, they just make me... feel weird,"" Jason said before mentally kicking himself, ""Sorry if I came off as rude."" 
 
""I took no offense,"" the girl reassured him, ""and if you also take no offense, I would ask a question of you."" 
 
""Shoot,"" Jason said absently as he peered ahead at the opposite river bank in the sweeping bend to the left ahead.  There was something odd about how the turf was lumpy. 
 
""You do not do as I was instructed.  You do not remain aloof, you do not order things done to show that you know how to give good commands.  Yet you have this trust, how is this?"" 
 
""That's one way to get respect.  Another is to be there, to ask questions, to help out, to recognize where folks are better than I am.  I don't want to be apart and above my friends."" 
 
Isis-Magdalene seemed to think that over for a while before she said, ""I see.  Your people do not expect you to be remote, so you may be with them.  I envy this."" 
 
""Well, you're with my people for the minute,"" Jason told her as he started to suspect... something, ""no need to try to hold yourself above.  I guess a lot of regular folks would see this as an insulting condescension in your circles."" 
 
""Indeed,"" she told him, ""It is refreshing to speak so frankly with one not nobly born."" 
 
""The sea is so wide you can never behold all that's in it,"" Jason muttered before he realized what it was he'd suspected, and concluded that he was correct.  Those green lumps in the side of the hill were structures of some kind, and a flash of furtive movement told him that whatever built them hid within.  ""Vai!"" he called as loudly as he could manage, and when her head broke the surface he snapped, ""back to the ship!  Now!"" 
 
Jason spun on his heels and began to trot back upstream, and noted that Vai had wasted no time in utilizing her powerful rudder tail to zip ahead of him toward *The Long Way* leaving a splashing wake trailing behind her.  ""What have you seen?"" Isis-Magdalene said as she did her level best to keep up with Jason. 
 
""Structures,"" Jason said, ""maybe it's instinctual animal building, or maybe they're people.  Either way, they hid in the structures when they noticed us.  Not a good sign.  I saw at least two dozen before we got around the bend, and if they're all grouped together like that... it's just a danger I'd rather not expose ourselves to."" 
 
""You are mighty in wisdom indeed,"" the girl panted as she stumbled over the hem of her dress, and muscles clattered from the bag to the pebbles below. 
 
Then, Jason's heart sank into his belly as he saw the tell-tale streaks of multiple landing craft burn their lines across the sky.  ""Sorry about this,"" Jason said as Cal's old hunting knife leapt into his hand, and he seized a handful of her dress to cut a long slit in it, ""but this dress is in your way.  We need to run."" 
 
""My dress!"" the girl cried in distress as Jason sheathed the knife again to take her by the hand as she gasped, ""Run?!  I have not the- uuk!"" 
 
Jason half-pulled and half-dragged her along the river bank as he took the long, loping strides of a heavyworlder on a lightworld.  ""Focus,"" he said between strides, ""on, breathing.  I, won't, let, you, fall."" 
 
They ran.  They ran as the burning streaks of entry faded in the sky.  They ran as Jason started to draw some conclusions in his mind.  They ran as the high pitched whine of landing craft engines filled the air, and they ran as growing black specs came into view.  Despite all their efforts, they hadn't made it back to *The Long Way.*  Jason let out a string of disjointed curses in every language he knew as he veered away from the river and redoubled his effort to a sprinting run toward a collection of low, purple-leafed bushes.  
 
Vincent arrived at *The Long Way* to find Vai standing at the loading ramp and casting worried glances toward the river.  ""Where's Jason and Isis-Magdalene?"" He asked though his labored panting and let Trandrai slide from his back. 
 
Via slapped the dirt with her still damp tail nervously and said, ""He told me to get back to the ship, so I did.  I think they're on their way here, but they have to run..."" 
 
""Cadet!"" Vincent called skyward, ""Get inside and get *The Long Way* ready for takeoff! 
 
The boy took a looping dive that ended in a run directly up the landing ramp ahead of Vincent, who went directly to his armory. ""What are we going to do?"" Trandrai asked through a shaky voice. 
 
""You're going to take this,"" Vincent said as he shoved his carbine into her arms and started grabbing pistols, his tomahawk, and even a couple of grenades for his own use.  ""And guard *The Long Way,*"" he continued, ""while I go out and get them."" 
 
Tears ran down Isis-Magdalene's sanguine cheeks from her tightly pressed eyes as she cowered beneath the slender branches of the low patch of shrubs.  Her breath came in shallow, panicked shudders, and she couldn‚Äôt make herself be quiet.  Jason crouched on his haunches and peered through the violet leaves with cold, angry eyes at the shambling grub hosts making their way to their hiding place.  ""They shall take me again, they shall take me again, they shall take me again,"" Isis-Magdalene began to whisper as she shivered and shuddered beside him. 
 
With the surety that came from simple honesty, Jason told her, ""No, they won't.  I already promised.""  Seeing no other choice, Jason rose and took aim.

An ode, really, to *Arnold‚Äôs Pump Club* newsletter.

I subscribed almost by accident. I was hoping to pick up a couple of workout tips, but honestly, I didn‚Äôt have much faith. First, because I‚Äôm not a gym fanatic, and second, because I didn‚Äôt expect someone as famous as Arnold to offer anything truly useful for free.

But I was wrong. Very wrong.

The newsletter, created by Arnold along with Adam and Daniel , is full of interesting, science-backed content about health, exercise, and nutrition. But more than that, it consistently delivers positive, motivational messages. without falling into toxic positivity. It fights against misinformation, encourages people to take care of themselves, and somehow feels grounded, personal, and honest.

Sure, sometimes they‚Äôll promote a product or service. But after a year and a half of reading their newsletters, I can tell you: it‚Äôs more than worth it.

The fitness content is great.  
But the real gold is the mindset.

It‚Äôs about keeping motivation alive, not just for your body, but for your goals, your routines, and your life. These aren‚Äôt grand epiphanies or revolutionary ideas. They're often simple truths, common sense, the kind of things we forget when everything feels dark. The kind of reminders that can keep you going when you're on the edge of burnout.

And that brings me to my own story.

I‚Äôve been developing a video game solo in my spare time for nearly three years now. I‚Äôve poured about 90% of my free time into it. it‚Äôs something I love deeply. But here‚Äôs something that everyone in the game dev community knows: nobody really cares about your game.

It‚Äôs something we read online constantly. ‚ÄúYour game is yours, don‚Äôt expect the world to care.‚Äù And we *accept* that going in. But there‚Äôs a difference between *knowing* it and *feeling* it. When you've put your heart into something, and it‚Äôs met with silence or indifference ‚Äî it still hurts. Even when you're prepared.

It‚Äôs tough.

You begin to question everything. Whether it was worth it. Whether you should keep going. Whether you're just wasting your time. And in those moments, where there‚Äôs no light at the beginning of the tunnel, and no light at the end, something as seemingly small as a message from Arnold, Adam, or Daniel can actually make a difference.

A few well-placed words in a newsletter reminded me:  
Keep going.  
Because you started for a reason. And that reason still matters.

I know this might sound like a cheesy self-help book, or one of those feel-good slogans on a coffee mug. But these messages feel real. They‚Äôre grounded. Maybe because Arnold *has* ‚Äúbeaten the game,‚Äù and now he‚Äôs genuinely trying to help others level up their own lives.

So to Arnold, Adam, and Daniel:  
Thank you.

Your words have helped me stay in the fight, not just for my health, but for something I care deeply about. Even if no one ever plays my game, even if it never becomes anything, I‚Äôll know I finished it. And part of that is because of you.

I truly hope this message somehow finds its way to your eyes or ears someday.

You‚Äôre doing something that matters.

I‚Äôm 28, based in the UK. Not expecting immediate replies; life gets busy. But it‚Äôd be great to find something that flows. Something genuine, and maybe even something we actually look forward to. Low-key rare these days, I feel.

Currently working through a bit of a guilty pleasure read. If you‚Äôre curious, feel free to ask. I might tell you, if you ask nicely. Or take a guess if you‚Äôre feeling bold. Got one of your own? Book, film, playlist?



I got into running pretty impulsively and now I seem to have joined the running cult. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta. But I‚Äôm most definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. My feed is mostly race clips, questionable running tips, and scenic routes I‚Äôd love to try, ideally ones that end with good coffee.



I‚Äôve said a fair bit about me, but honestly love getting to know people, the small things, the deep things, the random in-between bits that make someone them. I genuinely enjoy listening and learning about people beyond the surface. That‚Äôs the kind of connection I‚Äôm most drawn to.



If you‚Äôre into books, running, voice notes/calls, or you're up for building a connection with someone equally invested in doing so, say hi. I‚Äôm always up for great connections and chats.



If you‚Äôve got a book or series that will completely consume me, or running tips which don‚Äôt involve building a shoe rotation worth the moon, I‚Äôm all ears.

I've kind of never really known what ""I wanted to be"". So when it came to crunch time, I just asked a friend who I thought was smarter than me, what would they do, if they weren't in the career they had. 

They said ""welding"".

I'm a 38M and after doing my apprenticeship, I stayed in the trade for a few more years (in various roles including including the peak ""workshop/operations manager"") before finally moving in to sales.

My sales journey is a whole other story, but this is already going to be a long one, so I'll stay on track.

 First, some background info.

I have always managed to become a very influential individual (although others would describe it as just being way too outspoken) within the companies I have worked for. Now I dont mean ""influencer"" in the way most know it these days, I just mean I've always had thoughts on selling more via brand awareness.

It just so happens to be, that every company I've worked for in my industry (metal manufacturing) didn't really have a ""marketing team"".

Let me explain, I live in Australia and whilst there are MANY international companies with subsidiaries here, it's often the case that ""marketing"" is done by Head Office, which is generally on the otherside of the  globe. Now, I have no place telling you lot that catering the marketing to the demographic of each country is beneficial, but when it comes to Aussies, man we're different.

So how do these companies execute targeted marketing in Australia? Well, they either just don't (and use whatever it done overseas) OR they leave it to the sales directors to figure out. And this is where my little story finally crosses in to Marketing. 

(Please hang in there as I really need your guidance)

Throughout the various companies I've worked in since I've been in sales (approx 8 years) I have (almost in order)

- determined the visual layout of a new outlet/branch (aus owned company)
- put together various ""company portfolios"" some that have turned in to the hard copy coffee table book.
- been the sole organiser and contact for the companies involvement in sponsorships including the Formula 1 and V8 super cars and a couple of music festivals, and lastly key contact for articles published in Industry relevant magazines, virtual and physical.

This was before I got in to sales management at a French multi national company I worked for in which I had the following titles
- Sales manager

- Specific market manager NEAPAC (Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand) this role I had to do market research and advise on a go to market strategy to the country heads, including budget and calculated ROI.

- Sales method manager - APAC (12 countries) in this role I was part of a strategic team that travelled to all of the countries with the purpose of learning how things work there and help create a marketing strategy. 

I guess the best way to put it was I was the ""subject matter expert"" for my sector. But rather than just being another SME, I ended up suggesting ideas that were accepted by all and all of a sudden I was the equivalent of the guy that ""knows computers"" so everyone goes to them for I.T help, except it was for Marketing.

I ended up suggesting that we take one of the existing products and rename it to something specific, just to hit a certain demographic globally. After manually trying to turn wheels, it finally was accepted and everything I thought of, from the name, artwork, to the type of video marketing, social media strategy, this was all given to the marketing team at head office.

It genuinely yielded excellent results across all 70 countries we had presence in. It resulted in 367% growth in sales on that rebranded product, from the previous year.

The last company I worked for I was the Business Manager, reporting in to the board. At this time I had the resource of a 4 person marketing team that was a shared service between the business I managed and a sister company that was also owned by the group. I got a REAL insight in to marketing here as they reported in to me and I could ask whatever question I wanted.

I ended up requesting to change the website layout, discovered all the marketing features hubspot has to offer and pumped the marketing team with heaps of ideas that all essentially worked out well!

Now here I am, taking a step back. In a regional sales manager role, working at my literal dream company. To give you an example, if it were cars, it's the same as me working for Lamborghini.

Now yet again, in a weird place where there's only marketing from Europe Headquarters. Not only that, but the sales team are basically incharge of local marketing. We can do whatever we want, so long as we stick to the brand guidelines (which I've read at every company I've worked for and have been fascinated with)

Upper management have zero idea what they're doing. The MD hired a marketing manager who was a 19 year old woman who had zero marketing studies and only experience was that she worked at a real estate agency previously and helped out with marketing.

Once she realised we were the ""Lamborghini"" of our product/industry she freaked it and bailed.

We currently pay this mid to late 50s lady a lump sum per year to assist with our marketing. ALL she does is sends elms and sometimes posts on our socials. The posts are out of touch, our dated and kind of miss the mark.

I'm finding myself absolutley losing my marbles at every opportunity missed wirh marketing. I'm constantly throwing out ideas, but not just that, I come up with full execution plans including budgets and timeliness for each of these ideas, even though most of them don't go anywhere with this company, because of this lady.

Now look, I understand the above is probably nothing to write home about, the success have been flukes and I really have no fucking idea what I'm actually doing with marketing but man... there's a passion there burning hotter than the sun's surface. I am constantly running ideas for friends businesses that result in success. I hyper analyse all the marketing around me. I walk in to businesses or think about brands I see and develop marketing strategies in my spare time just because I am curious.

My questions for you all.
- Should I do a marketing degree? How up to date is the curriculum? I'm perplexed as to how it keeps up with the ever so changing climate? How lucrative can marketing be?

My other more important question is for all of you, do you really feel you're making a difference? Is marketing really what I believe it to be, or have I put it on this magical pedastool? 

TL:DR - I've had very high level management jobs, but I'm thinking about throwing it all aside and diving in to marketing.

P.S - Yes, I fucking love Mad Men. I even watched the entire series of Workin Mom's, just because one of the man characters runs a marketing agency and you get to see how some of it goes down.

I'm 27, she's 29 and for context, she dropped out of college and moved to a very small town (literally about 1.5k people) with her boyfriend. 

Every single time in the past 4 years she's come over to visit (*every single time*) we *have* to go out and get shitfaced or else it's not a proper hangout.

I've partied from 15 years old until I was 24. I'm done, I don't want to get shitfaced anymore, my body can't handle alcohol no more, I'm tired for 2 days after and I get acid reflux for like days after. I just hate it. I've grown hobbies over the years and revisited old interests I had and I enjoy going out - but for a cup of coffee or some cocktails not to get hammered in a club and not remember anything. 

I've tried explaining this to her but she just refuses to listen, mainly because she misses me and wants to revisit the 'old days'. She has no hobbies or interests outside of drinking and going out for parties and honestly, that's fine by me, but I'm beginning to grow frustrated it's all we do togheter and I get a gnawing pit in my stomach every time she comes to visit because of this.

I've tried suggesting going for cocktails, to wine and paint nights, to movies, hiking, trivia nights...she just says 'yeah good idea, look there's an event coming up next month wanna go?'

I'm frustrated because we never do anything I ever want to do and I feel like we're not even spending quality time togheter downing tequila shots. 

Last year I actually refused to go out because it was pouring outside, we got into a fight and she started getting ready and putting her makeup on saying 'I'm going alone, you can either join me or not, I don't care.' I felt bad because I didn't want to spend our 2 days together fighting. 

I think she's grown to see me as boring also, because she finds all my hobbies boring and basically rolls her eyes when I talk about them (I like cozy gaming, hiking, local festivals, drawing...) which has also made me not talk about those things in front of her anymore. 

I love her and we do sometimes have fun but I've actually grown closer to my other friends over the years, more than with her.

I don't want to end the friendship but I'm so lost on how to approach this anymore and I feel like there's no other way than for me to suck it up if I want to have her in my life still.",1,1745413890.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",0,1745413739.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

1k5ynmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1k5ynmu/so_its_really_just_more_shopper_communication_now/,So its really just more shopper communication now?,"With all the panicking and worrying about this update. So, I know there are certain stores that don't sync their stock with Instacart system, or always change their brands, that I simply don't want to ever accept batches from anymore. Not a problem, I can get plenty of batches elsewhere. That's the free market, they can improve their systems to match those of the stores that are pleasant and rating safe to shop at if they want Instacart shoppers to take their orders. That's not my problem, it's Kroger Costco BJs or Walgreens problem.

And ugh Family Dollar, I actually haven't seen an order from there in a while because, I would guess, customers gave up and started going there themselves because Instacart shoppers would never take the orders.

But, from what I'm seeing is, this will basically just be more chatting from us, and more work for Instacart support resolving metric disputes that we can prove with those chats? Like, it's still instacart policy that customers have 10 minutes to respond right? That's when you say can't find customer, that's when you do the refund or replacement if you tell them that without a response you will do the refund or replacement. 

So my guess would be, you HAVE to ask about a ridiculous replacement where you know they will want a refund. Wait in the store for 11 minutes after the chat, even if there are just a few items in the order and it should take you 1-2 minutes to shop. Then the second minute 11 hits, you hit the checkout button and lock in your refunds and replacements? And then you dispute whatever impact that had on your metrics? So this basically just adds 11 minutes, plus the time to dispute, to every order, slightly lowering your hourly rate?

Like, if someone wants a potted basil plant I'm not getting them a shaker of powdered dried basil, I don't care what the app says I know the customer will not like that. If someone wants fancy cherry flavored coffee, I'm not getting them instant Folgers without their express approval in chat, I don't care what the app says.

But now you have to, HAVE to, replace and get the replacement backed by ratings protection even if it is not a good replacement. Because since it is backed by rating protection, it can't hurt your metrics. Refunding would hurt your metrics. Refunding as much as used to be normal will definitely get you deactivated eventually. And if the customer doesn't like it you just get a newer lower tip, but they can't give you wrong item or lower your rating for it? So you allow the customer to be dissatisfied, in order to keep your ratings up and protect your access to future batches, because Instacart IS satisfied.

So it seems to me like, it's not actually hard to play the game. It took us a few days of having bad metrics for stupid reasons, but we have figured out what they want us to do now. By giving the customer the standard 10 minutes to respond, even in cases where you know what the response will be (and I do know what the response will be, I'm a 4.95 diamond cart and had 1 disliked replacement ever). You lower your hourly rate but cover your butt with support. Who you also have to talk to much more often, also lowering your hourly rate.

Customer approved refunds aren't supposed to hurt you, like if the customer says never mind or just refund it, but currently they do and that's a glitch that will hopefully be fixed? 

We know how to keep our ratings up and metrics high now, and it's not hard. If anything it's easier than before. But we also know the experience of our customers, and their approval of what we are doing, will actually be worse.

Even though Instacart's metric system will keep our rating artificially high as we do the exact opposite of what the customer wants, because it makes Instacart more money. There is no way in heck anyone who actually is an instacart shopper honestly things our customers want us to be doing this. Instacart doesn't care if a customer paid for a block of cheddar cheese, and got a tub of cheddar cheese flavored chip dip, because that replacement was backed by ratings protection so the customer can't complain. But if this happens enough the customer will stop using Instacart! They can't rate me poorly, but if they stop using Instacart I still make less money because I just never get another batch from them.",1,1745413487.0,InstacartShoppers,0,1.0,False

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",1,1745413437.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Not because I couldn‚Äôt. But because‚Ä¶ part of me wanted to know how far this went. What it really was.

I smashed the recorder.

I took it outside behind the motel, found a chunk of concrete, and pounded it until plastic and wires scattered like dead bugs. Then I dumped the pieces in a dumpster and drove until the motel disappeared behind me.

But I should‚Äôve known better.

You don‚Äôt kill something like that.

You just make it mad.

That night, I stopped at a gas station off the highway. I went in to grab coffee, try to feel human again. When I came back out‚Ä¶

The recorder was sitting in my passenger seat.

Fully intact.

One new file.

REC007.wav

This one had no sound. Just silence. Ten minutes of pure, deafening nothing. But then, at the very end, a single word:

‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù

I threw it out the window while driving 80 miles an hour. I didn‚Äôt care where it landed.

But the next morning, it was in my motel drawer. Waiting. Its red light blinking like it had been watching me sleep.

That‚Äôs when I realized it didn‚Äôt need the recorder anymore. It had me. I was the vessel now.

That night, I dreamt in audio files.

Not memories‚Äîrecordings.

People screaming.

Pleading.

And whispering my name.

They weren‚Äôt just trapped in the recorder. They were collecting.

Then I heard a new voice‚Äîfaint, but unmistakably mine‚Äîsaying:

‚ÄúIf you find this, I‚Äôm already gone.‚Äù

1k5ymi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/I_DONT_LIKE/comments/1k5ymi8/i_dont_like_how_unnatural_life_has_become/,I don't like how unnatural life has become,"Firstly, I don't like how we have to depent on coffee to wake us up first thing in the morning. But when night falls we have to have special rituals in order to fall asleep easily, instead of simply relying on our circadian rhythm. Some of us even have to take pills to fall asleep either because we are too stressed or we don't get enough sunlight. 

Secondly, I don't like how much white sugar is in pretty much everything we consume. It's not the type of sugar that's meant for us to eat. It's mainly produced by plants to protect themselves from getting eaten by insects (as far as I know, feel free to correct me here if I made a mistake). Our main source of sweets should be fruits (and some vegetables). That's pretty much all the sugar we need. 

And thirdly, I don't like how much our lives have evolved around technology and staring at our screens. I'm not just talking about smartphones, I'm talking about TV, laptops, tablets etc. Most likely another reason why so many of us have sleep problems, not to mention depression, anxiety and so on. We are inside closed spaces all the time 'cause of this and have so many problems with mental health, creating/doing new hobbies and forming relationship with one another, not to mention forming a community.

1k5yltb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1k5yltb/family_history_research/,Family History Research,"Alright, let‚Äôs jump into the wonderful world of genealogy and family trees! Helping families trace their ancestry and design custom family trees is like playing detective, historian, and artist all rolled into one. It‚Äôs about connecting the dots between the past and the present, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt love a good family story? It‚Äôs like the original Netflix documentary, except you get to be the star!

First off, let‚Äôs talk about tracing genealogy. This process often starts with some basic questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? And, most importantly, why does Aunt Edna keep insisting we‚Äôre descendants of royalty? The truth might not always be regal, but every discovery invites a deeper understanding of who we are. By digging into historical records, census data, and even the occasional dusty old family photo, we can uncover those fascinating tales. And when you unearth a relative who survived a major historical event or migrated across the ocean for a chance at a better life, that‚Äôs where the magic really happens. These stories become the connective tissue of a family‚Äîbringing generations together in a tapestry of shared experiences.

Then comes the fun part: designing custom family trees. This is where creativity takes the front seat. A family tree isn‚Äôt just a boring list of names and dates; it‚Äôs an artwork that captures the essence of your family story. Imagine a beautifully illustrated tree with branches stretching out into the past, adorned with fun facts about each ancestor. You could include quirky details like ‚ÄúGreat-Grandpa Joe‚Äôs legendary meatball recipe‚Äù alongside his birth date. Now that‚Äôs a family tree that would make anyone proud to hang on their wall!

Now, how do we get the word out to those history buffs and family history enthusiasts online? Ah, the grand marketing strategy! This is all about meeting people where they are. Social media is your best friend here. A post showing a stunning family tree design might catch someone‚Äôs eye while they‚Äôre scrolling through their feed like a virtual shepherd leading them to the greener pastures of their own ancestry. 

Consider starting a blog or a YouTube channel where you share tips on genealogy research, design ideas, and even emotional stories that come from tracing one‚Äôs family roots. Let‚Äôs be honest: everyone loves a good ‚ÄúI found my long-lost cousin‚Äù story. Plus, think about hosting webinars or virtual workshops! Invite your audience to join the journey of discovering their lineage in real time. Use humor, personal anecdotes, and engaging visuals‚Äîin short, bring the same energy and authenticity to this new venture as you would when chatting with your best friend over coffee.

Lastly, don‚Äôt forget to tap into the power of community. Online forums and groups dedicated to genealogy are filled with individuals who are not only eager to learn but to share their own experiences. By building a space for interaction‚Äîmaybe even starting an online challenge like ‚ÄúShare Your Most Surprising Ancestor‚Äù you‚Äôll draw in an enthusiastic crowd ready to connect. Create a sense of belonging, and those family tree designs will be in high demand!

So, to wrap it up, helping families trace their genealogy and create beautifully customized family trees is not just about history; it‚Äôs about weaving connections, celebrating life stories, and building a community. It‚Äôs an invitation for everyone to say yes to their family‚Äôs journey‚Äîand perhaps, just like God‚Äôs invitation to us, it can stir something deep within the heart. Let‚Äôs help others discover their stories because, after all, everyone has a tale waiting to be told!",1,1745413348.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Looking for Ideas,"Hey all, I'm looking for some creative input and insight. I live in a house in a densely populated neighborhood in a large city that used to be a corner store back in the 80s/90s, serving the peeps around here. It was converted into a residence years ago, but I've been thinking of adding some value to the neighborhood and turning the first floor into a business again.

 context:

It's a corner property in a walkable neighborhood 

Two apartment buildings (one just opened, another coming soon) are within 2-3 blocks

I'd ideally live upstairs (3 rooms: bedroom, guest room, office), and run the business downstairs

There's also a large basement that could work well for storage. There is access to the basement from the street in the double doors built in the concrete.  

I'm open to ideas: modern takes on a corner store, coffee shop, specialty retail, community space, etc. I want it to be something that genuinely serves and connects with the people moving into the area and longtime residents alike.

What kind of business would you open in a space like this, especially in a neighborhood seeing an influx of new residents?

I currently work from home during the week doing admin computer stuff and do about 25-30 hours of kitchen work on the side just to keep some extra skills in my back pocket. 

I used to work at an Italian ice/ice cream spot that was walk up/window only and I always loved something like that because it reduces the need for walk-in accomodations. ",1,1745413128.0,Entrepreneur,3,1.0,False

1k5ygsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1k5ygsp/antimatter_universe_created_during_big_bang/,Antimatter Universe Created During Big Bang?,"I've had maybe a hairbrained theory on the creation of the universe for a while. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that the big bang is the most accepted origion for our universe. I always see arguments against saying how can everything be created from nothing all at once and I've always thought what if the BigBang is just the start of a cycle. 

Prior to the big bang, gravity eventually slowed all outward acceleration and began pulling the universe back towards a central point collapsing in on itself over unknown lengths of times, until essentially all matter is getting compressed together like a blackhole which then collapses on itself and goes some kind of supernova blowing all matter back out as a new big bang.

The second part to this idea is that (again correct me if I'm wrong) we don't see antimatter planets or stars or anything outside very small quantities of antimatter atoms floating about.

It's ridiculous to think newton's laws might apply to the entirety of the creation of the universe but for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. What if when the big bang explodes outwards it creates our universe out one half and an antimatter universe out the other? Like an entire mirror galaxy, the bizarro world?

I Finally Found Out Why.,"So I (26M) moved into a small, quiet neighborhood a few months ago. Everyone here is super friendly ‚Äî the kind of place where people still bring you welcome cookies and wave from their porches. But there was one thing I couldn‚Äôt figure out.

Every Sunday morning, like clockwork, someone would leave a fresh loaf of homemade bread at each doorstep. Always warm, wrapped in cloth, with a little note that just said, ‚ÄúHave a peaceful day.‚Äù

No signature. No hint of who it was.

Naturally, the neighbors started calling the anonymous giver ""The Bread Angel."" Some thought it was a nice old lady with a secret recipe. Others said it was a local bakery worker who didn‚Äôt want the credit. One guy even thought it was a marketing ploy for a new bakery. But no one ever saw it happen. It was always just... there.

I got curious. Last Sunday, I woke up at 5am, made coffee, and waited. Around 5:45, I saw a figure moving down the street quietly, placing something on each step.

It was Mr. Harris ‚Äî the retired schoolteacher who lives at the end of the street. He‚Äôs in his 70s, super quiet, always wearing a sweater no matter the weather.

I didn‚Äôt want to startle him, so I waited until later that afternoon and casually dropped by with a thank-you note and some jam I made (trying to return the kindness, you know?). He chuckled and said, ‚ÄúWell, I figured if I was going to be up baking anyway, I might as well share. It‚Äôs good to remind people that someone‚Äôs thinking of them.‚Äù

He told me he started it a few years ago during a rough winter, just to lift spirits, and it became his weekly habit.

Now a few of us have taken up the tradition ‚Äî not just with bread, but sometimes muffins, flowers, or little handwritten notes.

Hey fellow language learners! üëã

I‚Äôve always dreamed of becoming a polyglot ‚Äî not just learning languages, but actually living with them every day. But like many of you, I used to start strong and then‚Ä¶ drop off after a week. Motivation fades. Life gets busy. You know the drill.

Recently, I decided to approach things differently.

üìò I‚Äôve been reading *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, and started building systems instead of relying on motivation. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now:

üïí Daily habit:

* 7.5 min of **French**
* 7.5 min of **Italian**
* One chapter a day from Atomic Habits (to keep improving the habit system itself)
* ‚òï A small coffee + chocolate right after = reward and good vibes üòÑ

üéØ My goals are small, but they‚Äôre **consistent**. I track them and connect them to specific triggers (e.g. after waking up, after prayer, or after using the bathroom ‚Äî yep, even that works üòÖ).

üí° Biggest lesson so far?  
It‚Äôs not about doing more ‚Äî it‚Äôs about doing it **daily**. Repetition builds fluency more than cramming ever will.

If you‚Äôre struggling to stay consistent, try connecting your habit to something you already do. And make it enjoyable ‚Äî you‚Äôll be surprised how your brain starts craving it.

If you're on a similar path, I‚Äôd love to hear:

* What languages are you learning?
* What tricks help *you* stay consistent?

Let‚Äôs support each other and build that polyglot lifestyle ‚Äî one small win at a time üß©üåç

<div>### Blending Rustic Charm with Urban Edge

Embracing **Tuscan industrial decor** means fusing the warm, earthy aesthetics of Tuscan design with the raw, utilitarian feel of industrial style. This unique combination creates inviting spaces that balance rugged metal elements with natural stone, warm wood finishes, and rich terracotta hues. The key is to harmonize the warmth of Tuscan materials like travertine and aged oak with industrial staples such as exposed brick, iron fixtures, and metal piping.

### Key Elements That Define Tuscan Industrial Spaces

- **Natural textures:** Rough plaster walls, reclaimed wood beams, and stone flooring enhance authenticity.
- **Metal accents:** Wrought iron chandeliers, steel furniture frames, and industrial lighting fixtures provide contrast.
- **Earth tones:** Warm terracotta, muted ochre, olive greens, and deep browns create a cozy ambiance.
- **Open layouts:** Spacious interiors with high ceilings showcase structural elements like exposed ducts and wooden trusses.
 
### Incorporating Furniture and Decor

Choosing the right furnishings is essential to achieving the perfect Tuscan industrial look. Opt for distressed leather sofas paired with iron-framed coffee tables and rustic wood shelving. Decorative accessories such as vintage pottery, wrought iron candle holders, and handwoven textiles add character and depth. Mixing these elements offers a refined yet lived-in appeal that appeals to those seeking both elegance and edge.

Ultimately, **Tuscan industrial decor** offers a timeless style that marries tradition with modernity‚Äîideal for homeowners and designers looking to create spaces rich in texture, warmth, and architectural interest.

This morning, I sat out on the porch with a cup of coffee, the dog snoozing at my feet, and just enough peace to feel like I might be getting away with something. The sun was rising slow over the hills like it had all the time in the world, and I figured, if that old sun can show up every single day without complaining, maybe we can too.

See, the sun doesn‚Äôt get up because it wants to. It gets up because that‚Äôs what it does. Day after day, shine or storm. No round of applause, no pat on the back, just good old-fashioned dependability.

And I reckon that‚Äôs a pretty good way to live.

There‚Äôll be days, kiddo, when your bones feel heavy, or your heart does. Days when you‚Äôd rather stay curled up and let the world spin without you. But showing up anyway, that‚Äôs how you grow into someone folks can count on. That‚Äôs how you earn the kind of respect that doesn‚Äôt need to shout.

Not every sunrise is spectacular. Some are foggy, some are plain. But they‚Äôre all proof that a new day‚Äôs here, and you‚Äôre still in it.

Also, brush your teeth. Your breath could etch glass.

That‚Äôs all for now, Whistlebritches. Remember, the world‚Äôs a better place when you show up, so keep showing up.

**What did all these coins have in common? Was it some secret strategy? A paid KOL?**

**The answer is simple, all they had was a community. A relentless, unstoppable community who did not take no for an answer. Day after day, week after week, month after month they plugged away working hard and not selling, to push their coin to the top. There is no magic solution‚Ä¶..**

Kendu understands this and that‚Äôs why we just work, work , work. Chads/Chadettes are logging in daily, smashing tweets, Reddit posts, Instagram posts, IRL shilling and whatever else. We know that with enough hard work anything is possible and if you have been in crypto long enough, you will have realised that we are not work shy!

The game is simple, Kendu is everywhere and it has been proven time and time again that community determines the value of a meme coin. All the signs are there, Kendu is my only play and it is going to the tens of billions. Kendu‚Äôs social media dominance rivals the very best on Twitter and we have completely taken over the vast majority of crypto subreddits with our engagement through the roof. On social media we are without a doubt one of the front runners, but that‚Äôs not even our biggest strength... Our biggest strength is IRL. What Kendu is doing IRL is unprecedented and will set the standard for many cycles to come. Yes, at first glance these claims may sound preposterous, but if you do a bit of research, you will see that I have a point.

¬†Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

Kendu is currently sitting at a market cap around 10 million with an ATH of 283 million, we have around 18k holders and are on 3 chains:Ethereum(native), Solana and BASE. We are over a year old, have survived multiple, brutal redistributions. We have appeared on a Coinbase advert and have achieved 50k Certik votes(only other coin to do this is Pepe).

After 10 years I'm going back, but I need  some final tips related to locations and the upcoming national holidays

Please note that I already searched a lot on this sub and I also used blogs/chatgpt to organize the trip, but it's always better to ask humans to get better recommendations or making mistakes :)

**CONTEXT:**

I'm 42yo and my girlfriend is 35yo
In Thailand 2015 I visited Bangkok, Koh Phangan, Koh Lanta, Krabi, and briefly Phuket  (including some amazing 4 islands tour in Andaman). It will be my GF first visit to Thailand. 

 I heard that the weather might be considerable worst in Andaman, so we thought about spending time in the North & Gulf of Thailand instead.

**ITINERARY PLANNED:**

3rd to 4th May - Bangkok (2 full days)
5th May - Early flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai 
67th to 7th May - Chiang Mai (2 full days)
8th Travelling from Chiang Mai to somewhere in the 'Gulf of Thailand'. I suppose we might not be able to arrive in the same day
9th to 13th - 'Gulf of Thailand'
14th May - Coming back to Bangkok
15th -  Bangkok (last full day)

**I NEED YOUR HELP/OPINION:**

**1- National Holidays on the 4th, 5th, 11th and 12th**
 We really don't know how that will impact Bangkok and Chiang Mai in terms of availability of activities, restaurants and coffee shops. Initially we thought about moving to Chiang Mai on 4th May but we thought that spending 2 national holidays in Chiang Mai wouldn't be a good idea.

**2- We are a bit unsure about whether going to Koh Phangan/Samui or Koh Chang/Mak/Kood.**

2a - We won't go partying,  we won't do scuba diving, and we really don't mind not doing snorkelling (we get sick easily). 

2b - We prefer to be around locals to learn about their culture, etcetera. But we are ok if there are tourists too, we aren't the 'funny' tourists that want everyone to be local except ourselves, lol. As long as it's not an area full of tourists drinking and partying we are fine.

2c - We'd like to have enjoy some white sand with pristine water beaches. Just for reference, on my 2015 visit I liked Chaloklum Beach in Koh Phangan, and I was truly amazed with Koh Kradan in Andaman Sea.

2d -We also would like to have restaurants and coffee shop options (local ones is fine). My girlfriend would also like to do Yoga if there is some nice place. We aren't hippies btw, she just likes doing yoga, pilates and all that stuff.

I still play on the official servers, maintaining multiple accounts (2 of them paid). I have 4  accounts with fully trained characters in all slots. My main account has access to all in game content and a lot of add  ons and other slot expansions like stables and housing.

I still run vendors although they have not been stocked in a little while as I've been away from the game trying to build our Youtube channel, our website, all our socials, upload content and play/stream some other games.

Ultima Online has always been the game I come back to, a place to chat with old friends at West Brit Bank, talk to members of TWT, LNR, UWF and other guilds still active since the early days...

Shout out to Tatiana who always puts out a beautiful tavern/coffee shop at West Brit bank and players like myself are still able to gather, share stories and have a few treats and goodies made by her own hand.

If you used to play Ultima Online, if you play now, if you don't play but are curious about this game... I invite you into the world, to explore, to do anything you want. This is the most open game you will ever find. 

Please drop a comment below and share some of your own Ultima Online memories and experiences. This is one of the most Legendary games that has ever been created. We can't go back in time to the 1990's when this game originally released but it still gives me a lot of happy experiences and moments.

This is the story of how I finally found clarity, broke free, and experienced life for the first time.

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever opened up about any of this‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand honestly, never in my life did I imagine putting my real name to something like this. But after carrying it for so long, it felt like the right time to stop hiding from it.

For most of my life, I thought I was broken‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääanxious, obsessive, lost inside my own head. The only word I ever really had for it was that I felt stuck.

A few weeks ago, everything changed.

Have you ever had a moment where your body went into pure survival mode‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand your mind never fully came back?
My anxiety began almost immediately after my grandfather died. I was 11 years old. When he passed, something inside me broke‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it wasn‚Äôt until I had a near-choking experience that I felt like I completely lost control of my mind. Even though I didn‚Äôt fully choke, I was overwhelmed with fear and was terrified.

My dad was cutting the grass, and my mom was grocery shopping so I was alone in the house. Somehow I managed to pull the food out of my throat‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand almost immediately after I caught my breath, my dad walked through the door.
That moment triggered something deeper. It was like my brain flipped into permanent survival mode‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it never flipped back.

Little did I know that single incident would lead to what became internal hell for over 20 years.

I became afraid to eat. Legitimately afraid. And it wasn‚Äôt just when I was sitting down to eat‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI would think about it over, and over, and over again. It got to a point where it was all I thought about. My brain was stuck in a constant ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù loop. It lasted for months‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the loop wasn‚Äôt just two or three times a day here and there. It was all the time, and my mind was running at a million miles an hour, every second of the day.

It made focusing on anything almost impossible. It felt like I was drowning in my own mind. I was completely stuck. And that‚Äôs what I started calling these obsessive thoughts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbeing ‚Äústuck.‚Äù
One thing led to another. The obsessive thoughts began to spiral. It wasn‚Äôt just about being afraid to eat anymore. Anything that had the slightest emotional impact on me could set me off.
I remember being in school once and we were on the topic of cancer. My teacher said something along the lines of: ‚ÄúOne day you could wake up and have a brain tumor.‚Äù That one comment sent me into a year-long spiral‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot just scared that I had a brain tumor, but absolutely convinced that I did.

It wasn‚Äôt off and on‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was constant. It was my only thought, all the time. I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything else because I was essentially holding my brain hostage‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääliterally every second of the day. Every headache, every feeling, every weird thought‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI was sure it meant something was wrong.

It hijacked my entire life. And that‚Äôs just one example.

It didn‚Äôt stop after that. Every few weeks or months, there was a new obsession‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa new fear, a new worst-case scenario‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand my brain would lock onto it like it was life or death.
That cycle went on for over 20 years.
The fears would shift, but the spiral was always there.
My brain never gave me a break.

This wasn‚Äôt something that just happened to me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was who I was. A kid stuck inside his own head, fighting battles nobody else could even see.

What still amazes me is this:

I can‚Äôt believe nobody outside of my family ever noticed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat least not that I knew of.

Not really.
Not fully.

I got so good at hiding it that even the people closest to me only ever saw the surface‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe jokes, the distractions, the small pieces I let them see.
But underneath it all, I was drowning.
And somehow, nobody realized just how deep it went.

My parents were the only ones who ever tried to understand. They saw me suffer, lash out, scream, cry‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätell them I felt like I was going insane. They felt helpless.
I would try to explain how it felt like having different songs stuck in my head at all times. All day, every day.
The only time I got a break was when I fell asleep.
Then I woke up‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärinse, repeat.

I was convinced everyone was judging me all the time.
In reality, I was just insecure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause these obsessive thoughts were so much a part of me, I couldn‚Äôt understand how people couldn‚Äôt see it.

It felt like it had to be obvious.
It felt like I was broadcasting it somehow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven when I wasn‚Äôt. From everyone else‚Äôs perspective I was just a normal kid.
But the truth is, I carried it alone.

My parents did everything they could. I remember them spending thousands trying to help me‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätherapists, psychiatrists, whatever they thought might help. They even tried hypnotherapy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause by that point, I was so terrified to eat that I would go days without eating anything at all.

Eventually, they brought me to a psychiatrist‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho didn‚Äôt figure out what was actually wrong. They just threw me on antidepressants like Paxil, Effexor, and Celexa. I was still just a kid. And when I tried to come off those meds, the withdrawal was so brutal doctors compared it to heroin detox.
The meds didn‚Äôt fix me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey either numbed me, made me angry, or made me feel unhealthily invincible where all I wanted to do was fight. It wasn‚Äôt strength‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was instability. I wasn‚Äôt myself anymore.

There were also teachers I had in school who didn‚Äôt know what to make of it. Some would sit me in the back of the classroom with headphones, while the teacher wore a mic so their voice could go directly into my ears. That‚Äôs how bad my focus was.
And it wasn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt trying‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was because my mind was trapped. I was stuck in nonstop loops of fear and obsession, and anything that required real thought or attention felt impossible.

At school, I got good at hiding it. One of the biggest ways I survived was humor. Cracking jokes, making people laugh‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit became my crutch. It made me feel normal. It made me feel like, at least for a few minutes, I belonged.
Making people laugh wasn‚Äôt just a habit‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was a vice that kept me going. But underneath it all, I was stuck. Living in survival mode while everyone else just lived.
I didn‚Äôt even realize it at the time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut looking back, that‚Äôs exactly what it was.

Talking to people, especially new people, was pure anxiety. While trying to have a conversation, I‚Äôd be overthinking every single word. And job interviews? Imagine trying to make a strong impression while an entirely separate conversation is happening inside your own head. It was like someone was talking directly into both of my ears while I was trying desperately to concentrate.

It was absolutely bizarre‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it was my normal. It‚Äôs all I ever knew.

My best friend saw more of it than anyone outside of my family‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut even he didn‚Äôt know the full extent. Most people didn‚Äôt.
The obsessive thoughts never fully went away. They consumed me. They were the last thing I thought about before I fell asleep, and the first thing I thought about when I woke up.
Some obsessions would take over for days, even months at a time‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälooping and spiraling until I didn‚Äôt even remember what it felt like to think about anything else.

The eating issues calmed down around 16. But the anxiety just shifted to other things.

In my twenties, it came in waves instead of being constant. That felt like an improvement‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it was still hell.
It‚Äôs actually a big part of why I left college the first time. 
Mentally, I was overwhelmed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand underneath that was a lot of frustration and anger at myself. Frustrated that I needed medication just to halfway function‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand even at that, it felt like I was only operating at a fraction of who I knew I was supposed to be.

I eventually went back later and finished. But at the time, I wasn‚Äôt ready.

For most of my life, I just accepted this as normal. I figured that‚Äôs just who I was‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääanxious, obsessive, broken.
It destroyed my confidence in ways I didn‚Äôt even realize until recently. It wasn‚Äôt just feeling like I wasn‚Äôt good enough‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI genuinely believed it. Even in the smallest moments‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconversations, schoolwork, anything‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI lived with impostor syndrome.

People around me would tell me I was smart, successful, even impressive sometimes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I couldn‚Äôt feel any of it. Internally, I was a mess‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand no amount of praise could convince me otherwise. It was as simple as that.

Until about a 6 months ago.

I reached out to an old therapist I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. I explained everything.

The first thing she asked me was: ‚ÄúHave you ever been evaluated for ADHD?‚Äù

I was confused‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause it‚Äôs not like I was hyper. I always assumed ADHD meant bouncing off the walls, and no one had ever even mentioned it before.

My entire life, I had been treated for anxiety and OCD‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämedicated with antidepressants in one form or another‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut no one ever looked deeper.

Looking back now, it‚Äôs clear those diagnoses were real, but they were rooted in undiagnosed ADHD the whole time.
That‚Äôs when she told me: ‚ÄúI would bet anything you have inattentive-type ADHD. You should get evaluated.‚Äù
It took me a few months to act on it. I don‚Äôt know if it was fear, doubt, or just exhaustion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I sat with it for a while.
Eventually, I made an appointment with my doctor. After a few more months of conversations, I finally got prescribed Adderall XR.

Honestly, I thought I was going to be a nervous wreck on it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially because I‚Äôve always been sensitive to caffeine. Even a little coffee would make my heart race and give me anxiety.
I expected Adderall to do the same thing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust worse.

But it didn‚Äôt.
It brought a calm I‚Äôve never experienced before.

For the first time in my life, my brain was quiet.
It‚Äôs only been about 20 days‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it‚Äôs like a light switch flipped.
After twenty years, it feels like my brain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich had been dormant my whole life‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfinally turned on.

I can stay present.
I can focus on one thought at a time.
I can actually absorb what I hear and read instead of it bouncing off me.

I‚Äôm not spinning off into worst-case scenarios every minute.
It‚Äôs the weirdest, most incredible feeling I‚Äôve ever experienced.
And the crazy part is‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI always knew there was more in me. But my brain wouldn‚Äôt let me get to it.
Now, for the first time, it feels like I‚Äôm actually seeing what life is supposed to feel like.

Honestly, what I‚Äôm sharing here barely scratches the surface. I could go on for hours about the different obsessions, the different fears, the different ways my brain convinced me I was in danger when I wasn‚Äôt.

This might feel long‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut compared to what I actually lived, it‚Äôs just a glimpse.

I don‚Äôt even know where I stand right now with my anxiety and OCD. It‚Äôs like they disappeared overnight. Right now, I‚Äôm obsessing more over this new normal‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause it‚Äôs completely foreign to me. And honestly? I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs temporary.
It feels too good to be true.

I‚Äôve even tried to obsess over things I normally would (crazy right?)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I can‚Äôt. I can just move on.
It‚Äôs completely insane to me.

Another thing I can‚Äôt ignore:
I just feel like I‚Äôve leveled up intellectually overnight. It‚Äôs like the dormant part of my brain unlocked and became a sponge for information.

Everything I‚Äôm told, I remember.
It‚Äôs not a photographic memory‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it‚Äôs like I finally have full access to who I‚Äôve always been underneath.
But because it‚Äôs only been about 20 days, and I‚Äôm still adjusting to the medication, I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic.

Any anxiety I do have now is more physical than anything else. Like, sometimes my heart will race‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand a few weeks ago, that would have sent me into a full-blown internal meltdown. On the outside, no one would‚Äôve known. Like I said I‚Äôve gotten good at masking it.

But inside, it would‚Äôve been pure chaos.

The other day it happened.
I looked at my Apple Watch, my heart rate was elevated, but I literally said to myself:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù

Twenty-one days ago, that moment would have unraveled me internally.

I also know there‚Äôs a lot of stigma around Adderall.
I‚Äôm not here to say it was my miracle drug.
I‚Äôm still taking antidepressants too (Prozac)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthough now, for the first time, I actually have hope that I can eventually get off them. Because even while being on them before, I would still spiral constantly.

Doctor‚Äôs have told me, and I‚Äôm doing my best to believe it, that that reality is Adderall didn‚Äôt change who I am‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit gave me access to who I‚Äôve always been.
I fought too hard for this clarity to ever feel weak for using the right tools.

I‚Äôm not masking anything.
I‚Äôm finally living without chains.
And that‚Äôs more than I ever thought was possible.

For the first time in my life, I‚Äôm unstuck.
I‚Äôm still figuring all of this out.
But for the first time, I‚Äôm not trapped inside my own head.
And for now, that‚Äôs enough.

The crazy part is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven writing all of this down is something I don‚Äôt think I could have done a month ago.
For so long, my mind was too overwhelmed, too scattered, too stuck to organize anything like this.

The fact that I‚Äôm even able to share this now is proof that something real has changed.

I don‚Äôt know who needs to read this. I just know I needed to share it.

I‚Äôm not sure what sharing this will really do‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut after carrying it alone for so long, I‚Äôm finally ready to share it.

How does one maintain the assumption that you already have what you want/are getting what you want instantly, when literally everything in 3d (even basic awareness) goes against it?

Long ver.:

(It's early morning forgive me if my thoughts seem jumbled.)

So I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea of the law of assumption.

Like, how does one control every assumption you have throughout the day and night? Micromanaging your thoughts to make sure every single one aligns with what you want to manifest?

And what about the 3D/current reality? Like literally everything in your world is telling you ""You don't have what you want."" Like yeah sure if I want body changes or something I can avoid looking at mirrors and ignoring what people say but ultimately I am constantly feeling my own body and am constantly aware of what it is (because it's my body), and no amount of going ""No my body is this way, is going to remove that awareness of my body.

Like, I hear that you can manifest literally anything instantly, but isn't the mere act of manifesting or even thinking of manifesting simply just affirming that you don't have it yet?

What about time? I can tell myself I already have what I want, but then I don't immediately have it. And this just reinforces the idea that manifesting takes time.

I just feel completely overwhelmed and confused by the idea of LOA. I get it's supposed to be simple but everything is telling me it's not, and it's just leading me to being more confused.

Idk if anything I'm saying makes sense, I need coffee, if someone can help I would greatly appreciate it.

1k5y2nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k5y2nt/does_the_secura_french_press_coffee_maker_offer/,Does the Secura French Press Coffee Maker Offer the Best Brew Experience Review?,"Secura SFP-34DS French Press Coffee Maker has become quite the staple in my kitchen lately. With its high-quality 304-grade stainless steel construction and practical design, it boasts a level of durability that sets it apart from most other coffee makers. I never realized how much I needed this coffee press until I started using it daily. But let me dive into the details, as this product has its share of standout features and a couple of quirks too.

**Build Quality and Design**

One of the very first things I noticed when unboxing the Secura SFP-34DS was its sleek and durable stainless steel design. Unlike glass French presses, this one feels robust, and there‚Äôs no anxiety about accidentally cracking it or typical wear and tear. Both the interior and exterior are made of 18/8 (304-grade) stainless steel, which means it‚Äôs not only strong but also resistant to rust and corrosion. 

The decision to include a cool-touch handle and knob is just brilliant. Even after brewing piping hot coffee, the handle feels safe to grip. The finish is smooth, and though subtle fingerprints do show up occasionally, a quick wipe keeps it shining. For me, durability and ease of cleaning are massive positives when investing in kitchen tools. Oh, and yes, it‚Äôs dishwasher safe, which makes life all the more convenient.

**Exceptional Coffee Quality**

Taste is what truly matters in the end, and this coffee press excels here. The three-layered stainless steel filter structure ensures not even the tiniest coffee grounds sneak into your cup. I‚Äôm someone who can‚Äôt handle the thought of gritty coffee dregs ruining my experience, so this feature hit home. Whether I‚Äôm going for a classic French roast or experimenting with lighter blends, this press delivers a consistently rich and bodied flavor.

A delightful surprise was the inclusion of extra stainless steel screens. I tried stacking two filters as suggested, and it really did provide an even smoother brew. The ability to tinker with filters gave me room to customize the texture and strength of my coffee based on my mood.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**

Using this coffee maker felt straightforward from the start. Its 34-ounce (1 liter) capacity is perfect for my caffeine needs, on mornings when I need that first kick of energy or when hosting a few friends over for brunch. In terms of cleaning, it‚Äôs better than expected. Disassembling the filter is a breeze‚Äîjust two minutes, and it‚Äôs ready for the dishwasher. This alone makes it perfect for chaotic weekday mornings when I'm juggling between coffee prep and work emails.

[Check Secura SFP-34DS price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00je36glq/)

**Positives**

- Durable 304-grade stainless steel build that outlasts glass alternatives.
- Triple-layered filter system for grit-free, full-bodied coffee.
- Cool-touch handle and knob for safe pouring.
- Extra filters for customization.
- Dishwasher safe and easy to clean.

**Critiques**

- Minor fingerprints can be a nuisance if you're meticulous about appearances.
- The steel construction, while durable, absorbs heat quickly, so pre-warming is essential before brewing.
- Limited aesthetic variety‚Äîit would‚Äôve been nice to see more color or finish options.

**Product Comparisons**

Having previously used glass French presses, I can confidently say this press holds a significant edge in durability. For instance, comparison with Bodum Chambord French Press shows this one doesn‚Äôt break when accidentally knocked over, though the latter may flaunt a vintage aesthetic. Another competitor, Frieling‚Äôs Double-Wall French Press, comes close in terms of performance but is priced noticeably higher, making the Secura press seem like the smarter purchase. The trade-off with the Secura is that it doesn‚Äôt retain heat as effectively as Frieling‚Äôs double-wall insulating design, though adding an insulated cover or cozy solves this to some extent.

**Worth Every Penny**

While I often find myself skeptical about whether premium kitchen items are worth the investment, this product delivers considering its features and durability. Over the weeks I‚Äôve used it, I feel confident recommending it for coffee lovers who value robust flavors and sturdy equipment. The convenience of being dishwasher safe combined with the reliable filtration system makes its price justified compared to similar products on the market.

1k5y2ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1k5y2ee/how_to_self_train_to_make_some_actually_good/,How to self train to make some actually good coffee?,"Hi All!
I‚Äôm taking a break from life for the next couple of years, moved to a more rural area, and I‚Äôve taken on a part time job at a small cafe that‚Äôs just recently opened‚Äîthe only job that was going in the area.

The owner‚Äôs standards for making coffee starts and finishes at ‚Äòpush roughly the buttons that gets the result the cheat sheet says looks right‚Äô. I got half a shift‚Äôs worth of training on how everything works and that‚Äôs been it. I was lone working after one and a half weeks.

Just to set the scene of what kind of work environment it is, I‚Äôve had to make numerous suggestions for how to organise things and display things just to get sales going. Like actually putting prices and labels by pastries in their displays so people don‚Äôt have to ask a dozen questions just to know what‚Äôs on offer, not pricing their cheapest drinks as the milk heavy drinks that use whipped cream, not pricing all their cold cans regardless of size the exact same price. After a week of working there, and a month of it being open, I asked how often the machine was cleaned and who last did it. The answer? Not sure and can‚Äôt remember. Turns out they didn‚Äôt know how to do it, and one employee had done it maybe once or twice.

Frankly, to keep this job I absolutely am not expected to do any training or make coffees any better than the standards they‚Äôve already set. But now I‚Äôve been here a few weeks and I‚Äôve got my feet under me, my professional pride is stinging. I don‚Äôt drink coffee, I‚Äôm a hot chocolate person, so I can‚Äôt tell just by taste what makes a good vs bad one. I‚Äôve worked in cafes in the past, but they had barely higher standards and I was a teenager at the time so I didn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm not going to get any better by asking anyone I work with, because I‚Äôve somehow landed myself position as one of the two head baristas. 

Now if I may be so bold, i can fairly confidently claim this cafe currently sells the nicest hot chocolates in town thanks to me. But I don‚Äôt know where to start on self teaching to raise my personal standards of the coffee I‚Äôm making. I‚Äôm looking for online resources that might explain all the ins and outs that I can use a guide to teach myself these things as best as possible for how to make a really good latte, cappuccino, espresso, flat white, etc. From milk temp, to art, to the science behind getting the coffee beans to do their thing properly?

Also any advice on where and how to start improving would be very helpful. I‚Äôm sick of wincing internally every time I hand over a coffee, because I‚Äôve got zero clue as to how bad it is. I just know it can be better.",6,1745411760.0,barista,2,0.87,False

\- 5 ounces water

\- heated water to boiling, mixed in gelatin, stirred until dissolved, removed from heat, slowly added the lemon juice while stirring, refrigerated overnight

\- removed from refrigerator, gave a very gentle stir, poured the mixture through a metal coffee filter. Mixture passed through with ease until the filter started to clog, then greatly slowed down. What did go through was not clarified. I re-ran the entire mixture through the filter.

Result: mixture is still lemon juice colored and cloudy

\- I then froze the mixture solid and placed it out to thaw

1k5xq0k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5xq0k,"First time fast, my experience.","hello there, I wanted to share here my experience in my first ever fast. The original motivation behind this was weight loss. I was on shift and having a hard time breathing while wearing my plate Carrier when I came across a post of someone losing weight via fasting.
I found this interesting as before I usually had times where I worked out and lost weight, but would then gain it all back and then some. The lowest I ever saw was 235lbs during the pandemic when I was training for corrections. Few years later and I'm sitting at 300lbs and miserable. 
After seeing that post I decided to just dive right in, no prep, no nothing, just a dream. Straight water fasting with some sparkling water. 

Day 0: first half was not too difficult as I still had some food in me, but once past the 12hr mark did the hunger pangs start to hit, and it was brutal. I like to eat a lot, but usually whole foods, no junk food or pop, and this came back to bite me.

Day 1: getting past the initial 24hrs was a mental challenge and required a lot of self discipline. This was not easy and rolling hunger pangs came and went. By now I lost the food weight and most of the water weight, and found myself feeling light and could breathe easier. Working midnights, I sleep through most of the day so the hunger didn't bother me as much.

Day 2: oh boy was this day crazy. While the hunger became muted my cravings and desire for food shot through the roof. I started negotiating with myself to just eat some food and try again later, order delivery, devour a whole cheesecake(I really love cheesecakes). Thankfully I bought some packs of sparkling water and this really help take the edge off enough to stay in control. I sometimes found myself mindlessly swiping to Uber eats before catching myself. 
Did some more reading on the subreddit wiki and learned more about keeping electrolytes which explained some of my symptoms (completely forgot about this)
Also something I discovered and saved myself from disaster is DO NOT TRUST A FART, IT IS A LIE. thankfully got home in time.

Day 3: decided to end my fast this day as I felt it was a good first time mile stone and next time properly gear up and do my research for the next one. To break fast, I had some broth and then an hour later light scrambled eggs with a small coffee. Thanks to you guys I learned the broth tip. What was interesting is my body felt like it refused to eat and getting that first bite was difficult, but good lord did it taste amazing. After reading others stories I get it now. 

Results: In total I lost 4.6 pounds. After getting past the hunger, fatigue, and into autophagy I started to feel great. Mind was much clearer(after some electrolytes/snake juice/taste awful), and the world has a noticeable increase in vibrancy(probably placebo or something idk). All in all it was definitely worth it. Feels like I got a full reset. 

Question for y'all. I'm wanting to do Keto/fasting moving forward. Any tips/advice on what foods to eat, stuff to prep before beginning a fast? I've read a lot of different opinions, but I want to hear yours.

## Key Features Analysis

The landscape of type C power banks is diverse, with models boasting a ‚Å£wide range of specifications ‚Å¢and‚Äå capabilities.Understanding‚Å£ these key ‚Äãfeatures is ‚Å§essential‚Å§ for ‚Å£selecting the power bank that best suits your needs. From capacity and charging speed to safety features and port options, we will analyze the most meaningful aspects to consider.

**Capacity:** The capacity of‚Å£ a power bank, measured in milliampere-hours‚Å¢ (mAh), dictates how many times it can recharge your devices. A higher ‚ÄåmAh rating translates to more charging cycles,making it suitable for extended trips or heavy usage.

**Ports and Compatibility:** the number and types of ports on a power bank determine‚Äå its versatility and compatibility‚Å§ with different ‚Äãdevices. Common port configurations include USB-C, USB-A,‚Å¢ and occasionally micro-USB.

Consider the number and type of ports available. A versatile power bank should offer at least‚Äå one USB-C port for charging newer devices and one or two USB-A ports for older‚Äã devices or accessories. Make sure that all ports‚Å§ provide the appropriate amperage for the devices you will be charging. Consider ‚Å¢whether you‚Äç need‚Äå multiple simultaneous‚Äç outputs, as some models split power between multiple connected devices.

Think about where you'll ‚Å§primarily be carrying the power bank and choose ‚Äãa‚Å£ size‚Å£ and weight that suit your needs. ‚Å£Slim and lightweight models are ideal for daily carry, while larger, higher-capacity models may be preferable for travel or‚Å£ situations where ‚Å£maximum power is required.

**Durability and Build Quality:** The ‚Å¢build quality ‚Å¢of a power‚Äå bank significantly impacts its ‚Å¢longevity and ability to withstand ‚Äãdaily wear and tear.‚Å£ Look for‚Å¢ power banks constructed ‚Å¢from durable materials with robust housings that can‚Å£ withstand accidental drops and impacts.

Durability is ‚Å§very important for long-term reliability. High-quality power‚Å¢ banks often feature robust casings constructed from durable materials like aluminum or reinforced plastic which can withstand accidental drops. Additionally, look for models with solid port connections and well-assembled‚Äå components.
