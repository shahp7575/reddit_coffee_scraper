Hey. Partially Pink Hair Girl here and my hair has really faded and isn’t that pink but I don’t like my hair today so we’re not even going to talk about it. Have I gone to 7 different sites pertaining to my issues about my hair and talked to four people repeatedly about it today alone. Yes. Sometimes when I’m stressed my brain decides I should pick something like hair and focus all my energy on that until I’m afraid I’ll just wake up one day and all my hair will be missing, having escaped into the night. Let’s not talk about hair. Did I say that already?

I’m your queen of chaos, I wear unhinged liked a gown, yet sometimes those things come in hot all at once and my brain is like what? and chaos is like surprise! and unhinged is like surprise motherfkr! and my brain elbows me in the ribs even though it doesn’t have elbows and is like did we invite these guys and I’m like oh don’t mind them they just come and go as they please, all while I sit in a ball on my bed, staring at a spot on the bedspread, forgetting that breathing is somewhat a conscious action. That last part is kinda poetic, isn’t it? 

Speaking of, I have to write a poem so I can work on with someone on Wednesday and I’m trying to think of what it should be about and I’m not sure? Like right now, I’m going through idk some kind of grief before grief? Is that a thing? What’s the word for the grief you feel when you know a huge loss is awaiting you and you’ll be crushed by grief once it hits? Your guess is as good as mine. Oh yeah, but before I was talking about grief I was talking about poetry which led me to say I’m feeling this pre-grief and that winds me in a circle back to poetry writing because I’ve been asking myself some existential questions (possibly to be put in a poem), one being why do bad things happen to good people? My coworker gave me an answer that has given me some surprising peace: the same reason good things happen to bad people. We got way into that, all the way to how people perceive their actions as good and bad so what qualifies as good and bad but then we had to actually do our job since we were at work so we couldn’t talk about it anymore. I don’t know how to write a poem about that though. Not yet. 

Yesterday was really cool because I drank coffee in a place that I can’t describe because then you might guess where I live and hunt me down and cut me into little pieces and like no thanks pass on that. But it was fun and it was a nice work day to though busy throughout. But today was a “family day” and many of us know that those days aren’t always great. I think the reason that I feel like I’m on the verge of a breakdown  rn (don’t worry, I’m not. This is a common feeling I have) is being around my mom for more than 2 hours. That’ll definitely do it. Lol one time when I first started talking to my therapist and she was getting to know me, I was just kind of trying to figure out how to explain my mom so I was throwing details at her and a what I thought was random but wasn’t detail was that my mom likes to watch people be in pain and that I could tell she likes watching me in pain especially. I was like LOL you know moms and she was like partially pink hair girl (can you imagine if I made her call me that? She’d either turn me in to the crazy police or she’d make me come more often and I’d end up paying for her next house or a really swanky car or something). Um oh yeah but she was like partially pink hair girl, that’s kind of sadistic in a way, don’t you think? And me being the Einstein that I am, literally was just like oh I guess, I never really thought of it before now. So yeah, it was family day. 

Some of you might be disappointed that I’m not being very bubbly and I’m sorry but also this is free content? And I’m not pretty enough to have an OnlyFans so sit down shut up and enjoy the show. I mean, tonight you get to witness the crazy in my head taking a walk out in light of day where anyone can see him (notice that crazy is personified as a “he.” Jeez, I wonder why….the answer is that some of you guys suck a$$, especially yesterday so come at me.). Ok I’m thinking of my hair again but just stay with me because now I’m thinking what if it’s my only good feature and this whole time people have been lying to me about my t!ts being ok too? No. Do not ask to see them. Should I take that part out? I’m going to leave it there. As a test to the humanity of the male species. I swear, if one of you asks for a pic, I will Liam Neeson your a$$: I will find you, and I….you get the picture. 

This post is sooooooo long and I hope none of you read it ever because then it’s like hiding my unhinged chaos in plain sight. Ok, so I need to think of a poem topic (I don’t write sonnets so don’t you dare message me randomly and suggest it or tell me to rhyme), unwind before bed because there’s no way I can sleep and also lately I’ve been confusing whether what I’m remembering actually happened or was a dream. Maybe I’ll hang out on Reddit (but stay away from the hair Reddits)(ohhhhh can anyone tell me some wholesome fun subreddits or subs or idk whatever the frick you say), I’ve been trying to read *My Year of Rest and Relaxation* (OMG I just realized the irony), or maybe I’ll paint my nails. Or I could clean my room. Actually no cleaning. Does organizing a drawer count? I could watch a cool movie. *She’s So Lovely* is the best movie of all time and also the trailer is horrible so don’t watch that, just watch the movie and turn it off if you don’t like it (but if you do that we can’t be friends anymore).



Cool, so thanks for probably not reading. A nice skim would be cool. Regardless, I’m gonna go. 

All the love left in my black heart,

Partially Pink Hair Girl </3

Does anyone do this anymore? Where's the romance in sharing the small, messy details of life gone?

I want to hear about your apocalyptic morning at work—the incompetent boss, the chaotic coworkers—and remind you how strong, beautiful, and intelligent you are, assuring you that things will get better.

I want to hear your same coffee-or-tea jokes every morning, laugh like it's the first time, and cheer you on through new projects or victories at work. I want to know the guilty-pleasure songs you blast when things are tough and the euphoric soundtracks for when life feels unstoppable.

Imagine us sharing a palette and canvas, sipping wine with names we can’t pronounce, or lying awake beneath the stars as you share your deepest fears and wildest dreams. I want to know what terrifies you, what fills you with wonder, and what foods make your heart skip a beat so I can secretly master them after a dozen failed attempts.

I want to laugh with you over my absurd plant collection—too many, I know—and have you water them when I forget. To humor my random bursts of passion and tolerate the unnecessary things I impulsively buy, even as I rant about capitalism while paying for expedited shipping.

Let’s wrap up a Friday night cocooned in warm blankets, cool jazz playing softly in the background. Or maybe we’ll share quiet weekends indoors after an active week, balancing life between movement and stillness.

Life isn’t always easy, and vulnerability is part of the journey. On hard days, I want to bury my head in your arms and feel the comfort of being understood. And I want to offer you the same.

About me: I’m a 30M living in a tier-3 tourist city where I’ve recently opened my own restaurant. I’m taller than average with brown skin, dark brown eyes, and an active lifestyle. I do smoke daily but am trying to quit. 420 friendly.

I’m looking for someone around my age who enjoys balancing an active lifestyle with quiet moments at home. While I’m not opposed to relocating for the right person, I’d love to connect deeply first and see where things go—whether it leads to a relationship, marriage, or simply a meaningful bond.

If any of this resonates with you, send me a message about the title of this post and, most importantly, tell me how your day has been. I’d love to hear it.

1gu19fx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gu19fx,first perfume/collection review from me,"Newbie premium perfume collector here. 3 months, 7 perfumes, I’ve got Golden juice, I’ve got blue juice, I’ve got pink juice, I’ve got yellow juice, I’ve got car juice, I’ve got Indian juice, and I’ve got black juice 🤣🤣.


Started 3 months ago when i came across this page slamming bella vita. Started using my dad’s random perfumes at childhood, then graduated to Amazon bestseller Bella vita 4-gift pack perfumes when my sister bought another bella vita gift pack and i fell in love with the perfumes. My 4x20ml-gift pack lasted 2 whole years, and I was considering buying their female gift pack (yeah m a guy, but my sister bought that pack recently and I loved 3 of the 4), when i came across this sub criticizing them. I had understood that most of the criticisms were baseless as most people either hate/love the smells, ones that stood out were for sillage and longevity. Coincidently my sister bought another perfume, Jaguar classic Gold, for her husband, she also told me she tested Jaguar classic black and i would go crazy for it since it smells like a new luxurious car. And so i had to buy it (sensing a pattern here?xD) even if it took my life. Couldn’t find any testers at shops or malls, so i decided to get a partial from this sub. And from there, 3 months later, here we are. 7 different scents in 3 months, should i stop already? 😆
Btw notes are taken from the internet, I’m too inexperienced yet to identify them on my own 

1. Denim Aftershave Original:
Freshest summer wear scent I’ve smelt ever!
I use it as an aftershave and Cologne. Dad used this since before i existed, love the smell. Heavy Boozy citrus, with a blast of pleasant alcohol, as it is a aftershave afterall.
9.3/10

Notes: Woody Aromatic fragrance for men. Top notes are Clary Sage, Bergamot and Petitgrain; middle note is Olibanum; base notes are Vetiver, Cedar and Amber.

(I wanna purchase the edt version, couldn’t find it in India, anyone help me out?☹️)

2. Jaguar Classic Black:
Fresh morning summer scent.
Global sensation. Smells really professional, first spray gives you a blast of spicy pepper, evoking a seductive nature. And the pepperiness lingers. Smells like the only perfume Harvey specter from Suits would wear. It would be an absolute shame to wear this perfume with casual clothing.
9/10

Notes: Top notes are Granny Smith apple, Bitter Orange and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Tea, Sea water, Geranium, Cardamom and Nutmeg; base notes are White Musk, Virginia Cedar, Vetiver, Sandalwood, Tonka Bean and oak moss.

3. Nautica Blue Ambition:
Apparently a sauvage clone, can’t vouch for it tho.
Blue summer frag. Fresh out of the shower vibe. Marine and Sea side feeling notes. Gives hotel premium detergent smell. Can be a bit slightly nauseous if the weather is extremely hot. Can be worn everyday spring and summer morning and evening.
6.89/10

Notes: Top notes are Bergamot and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Pine, Seaweed and Clearwood; base notes are White Amber, Cashmere Wood and oak moss.

4. Skinn Steele:
Winter/fall perfume, evening date choice fo sho.
First perfume that made me understand the difference between Amazon juice and premium juice. Heavy, Woody, Coffee and Vanilla are very much present. Kind of smells like Middle Eastern Oudy perfumes. Reminds me of my dad in my childhood (chill out he’s still alive). Can definitely overwhelm others near you.
7.8925/10

Notes: Top Notes Bergamot and Pink Grapefruit Essences, and Green Rhubarb
Middle Notes Pink Pepper, Pimento, Nutmeg, and Geranium
Base Notes Musk, Vanilla, Praline and Roasted tonka beans.

5. Kenneth Cole Black:
Weather neutral i feel. Newest one in da club (partial tho).
Kinda dont like, kinda like it. First time smelling it reminded me literally plain lemon pickle. Giving it some time, it feels like semi formal, semi casual smell. Now reminds me of the air freshener on Emirates Airlines flights. New york vibes literally, however anyone else who has ever tasted lemon pickle will think you spill pickle on you.
5.2/10

Notes: Top notes are Mandarin Orange, Water Mint, Ginger and Basil; middle notes are Lotus, Incense, Cedar, Nutmeg and Exotic Woods; base notes are Musk, Violet Leaf, Suede and Amber.

6. Victory Glowing Crystal:
Weather neutral, time neutral, women frag, but loved by me❤️🥹
From the bottle, looks like a Versace Bright crystal clone, can’t confirm tho.
Got it from my friend who got tired of it in a swap. More of a body mist than edp.
First time i sprayed it on my wrist, i fell in love with it, kept on smelling it for hours until it completely faded. Smells floral, with a barely noticeable fruitiness. It smells like what my crush would wear on a weekend evening at a mall😍😘. It’s only available in the US and other countries tho. Found a 99% similar frag, Fastrack Beat for her (absolutely no pun intended lmao), fruitiness is more pronounced.
6.79/10 (not joking, accidentally sprayed it straight into my eye while trying to decide the rating😭)

Notes: Top Notes: Bergamot, Pear, Pink Pepper. The fragrance opens with a sparkling blend of bergamot, enhanced by the juicy sweetness of pear and the subtle spiciness of pink pepper, creating a vibrant and inviting introduction.
 Heart Notes: Jasmine, Orange Blossom, Rose. At the heart, a bouquet of jasmine, orange blossom, and rose unfolds, adding a floral elegance and depth to the fragrance.
 Base Notes: Patchouli, Vanilla, Musk
The base notes feature a warm and sensual blend of patchouli, vanilla, and musk, providing a smooth and lingering finish that enhances the fragrance's allure.

7. Clone of Paco Rabbane One Million Lucky from roadside perfume vendor:
Fall, spring and winter perfume, although i have no idea if it smells like the original.
Was deciding between this and Tom Ford Oud Wood clone, thought i made the wrong choice first, but fell in love. Smells somewhere between royal and elegant.
Projection and longevity is cray cray for a clone, got 2.5/5.5(1meter). 450rs for 30ml 50% conc. I ******* LOVE IT VFM AF.
7.8/10

Notes of the original One million lucky:

Top notes are Plum, Ozonic notes, Grapefruit and Bergamot; middle notes are Hazelnut, Honey, Cedar, Cashmere Wood, Orange Blossom and Jasmine; base notes are Amberwood, Patchouli, Vetiver and Oakmoss.
Definitely seems very similar to the clone.

I read so many posts here and I feel very introverted (and weird) in comparison, which adds up to me always feeling like an outcast LOL 
I hate travelling, I'm not outdoorsy, music isn't important to me either. I'm introverted, have ADHD, going out and walking for *fun* sounds like a chore - I'm a healthy weight, okay! and I love gloomy weather. I just want to stay inside, browse reddit, have nice coffee with desserts, watch fun shit on YouTube, and play some video games on my steamdeck or switch. 🍰🎮✨

I don't think I'm negative in general, but life sucks and it's a struggle so I want to keep THAT sentiment real lmao Get out with your optimism, this wold is rotten. 

I want to complain, to hate, send memes, laugh and wallow together. Oh right. Im looking for a friend (friends?) to vibe with day to day. Tell me what you're eating, send me pics, or tell me what video you're watching or what you're doing at the moment. Tell me how you're feeling, too. Tell me about your bitch of a boss or enemy and I'll HATE them too. 💅

If your intentions aren't genuine, or you're just using me as a device to ease your boredom while you're at work, or just ""like to talk to new people"" as if it were a hobby (freak), then please don't message me. IM NOT A TOY.
I have so many people just stop giving a shit within the hour, and I'm the one only showing ANY interest. Fuck me for trying to make a connection and like, screw you for wasting my time👿💢
it feels mean. Idk. Anyway. If I don't sound Hella annoying to you, then llet's see if we vibe, let us gossip like regirock girlypops. 💖
I'd prefer female friends, but I know they're scarce ;-;
I'm selective but at least I won't waste your time 💛

Shit I like and about me, if that helps: 
•Video games (Indie games, Pokémon, Zelda, Ace Attorney, Kingdom Hearts, Bloodborne, Digimon, Fallout, Cult of the Lamb, Hollow Knight)

•Watching Tiktoks, Anime (I'm more selective these days), J dramas, movies (marvel movies!), BIG into YouTube drama rn. Mr Beast sucks 

•Horror and creepy shit, including horror games. Shout out to Nick Crowley and Puppet Combo games

•I do art things occasionally when my ADHD brain isn't ruining my life 

•Cooking, but specially eating and trying new things 

•I live in the UK

•Being an ally to the blahja people 🏳️‍⚧️

1gu1470,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gu1470/in_plain_sight/,In Plain Sight.,"I noticed that everyone in the coffee shop stared at me quietly as I grabbed my morning coffee.



The barista didn’t acknowledge it either. After he gave me my drink, he stared at me as I left the building.



I went into the subway, heading to work, and the people in there were staring, too. I sat across from a man who would not look away. I asked him to please stop and told him that it was making me uncomfortable.



He stood up.



I didn’t know what to do, so I moved next to a couple a few seats away. The first man walked over and stood above me, staring down. He smiled a little too wide. The smell of his cologne invading my nostrils was way too astringent. The couple stopped talking and sat on either side of me, linking arms behind my back.



I squirmed out of the way as they laughed. My heart was beating fast as I rushed to the next car.



The first person I sat across from said, “I saw you run away.” as he giggled a soft laugh. “That was pretty funny. You’re such a fucking pussy, aren’t ya?” He got up and blocked the doorway.



I started hyperventilating.



A woman that was sitting next to him sneered, “Look at you with your damn tight jeans and messy hair. Why’d you even get out of bed?”



She showed off her cleavage. “You like staring, you goddamned pervert. What the hell is wrong with you?”



The entire car erupted in laughter and pointed in my direction.



All of them got up and cornered me into the end of the car, chanting:

“Asshole!”

“Pervert!”

“Take his clothes off!”

Pushing me around each other.

“Sick freak!”

“Loner!”

All crowding around me, standing in my way.

“What a little bitch!”

“Look at him; he’s just cowering on the floor.”

“What a fucking cunt!”



I covered my ears and lay in the fetal position, waiting for it to be over, tears running down my face.



They stood there laughing over my body for what felt like hours.



We finally got to my stop, and everyone just sat down like nothing had happened.



They just conversed amongst themselves with normal small talk.



I stumbled out and toward my work, intending to tell my boss that I was taking the day off.



When I got to the office, my boss asked me to step into the conference room. One of my coworkers, whom I had trusted for many years, locked the door behind me.



“Hello, Maurice.” My boss smiled. “We’re having a little party for you.”



My coworker handed me a bottle full of vodka.



Everyone there chanted:



“Drink! Drink! Drink!”



Holding me down, they forced the cup into my mouth.



“This is for your own good! You need to fucking lighten up!”



“You’re such a damn suck-up.”



“Your little brown nose had it coming.”



“You’re fired!”

1gu130s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gu130s/th_coffee_during_a_curfew/,[TH] Coffee during a Curfew,"It was the 19th consequent night of curfew in the town of Kelshire. But even despite this, one still had to get things done.


And so, a woman was walking down the concrete and asphalt streets and tall grey buildings of the same material. Some of the buildings had broken windows, others no windows to speak of, and others were boarded up.


Many posters and pamphlets were spewn all around the streets too, calling the populace to arms. It was mostly a call against the inside threats, the reformists; and the outside threats, the ones still loyal to the great kings of old and who wished to tear down the new nation.


However, the woman with the tattered trenchcoat couldn't afford to expend spite - even if she normally had plenty to go around - to any of the mentioned at that moment. She had a 10 hour work shift tomorow and right now, as costly as it was, and as ilegal as it was, she had to resort to contraband.


And this contraband was a small box of coffee, that her usual supplier should have.


And so, she turned into an alley. And there he was.


It was a young man, his fave grimy, beard uncut, with a plain grey cloth shirt and a rotting wool overcoat. He looked at her as he squinted.


""Ah, Julia. It's you."" He greeted.


""Yes, me. Now do you have the coffee or not?""


""Oh? Well I might have, I might-""


""It's a simple question John. Please answer it.""


""Aight. For your mug it's 14 Telins.""


""What do you mean 14 telins!? That's double of what you usually sell me!"" Julia hissed ""Do I look like a noble to you? A posh merchant using perfume!?""


""No, rather, you look like someone not giving me the respect i deserve. Now pay up or feckoff.""


Julia's eye twitched. She wouldn't be denied caffeine, she barely could go by her day without stumbling as is!


So, she decided to do something unprecedented.


""I know where you live John.""


""Yeah, heard that one before-""


""St. Williams Street, above the Jolly Cafe yeah?""


""As said, your words."" John dismissed.


""I can call the patrolmen onto you. Even tell them you are a royalist.""


""Pft, you wouldn't.""


""Then give me my coffee and I won't.""


It was the time for John's eye to twitch. He then got out a thin but hand-long wooden cylinder with a thin metal line in the middle from his overcoat's inside. Light shined off it.


""You should have known better to threaten someone who deals with contraband."" the cylinder made a click.


With a snapping sound, a blade sprung out and locked in place at the cylinder's top from its side.


""...Shit."" was all Julia managed to say.


She then started to sprint out the alley. She was shortly followed by the sound of John's heavy footwear thundering after her.


The adrenaline in Julia's veins spiked as her heartbeat doubled. She needed to get away, but she didn't even know if she could get away, and even is she did-


She heard what sounded vaguely like a motor. A pair of car lights just down the street's turn, probably a patrol!


If she could only get there-


-And then she got kicked in the back, slamming and rendings her hands on the asphalt as she tried to halt her fall.


""I did tell you not to disreapect me!"" She heard John's words above her.


It was over. She would die here, without her coffee, and in the stupidest way possible.


But then, the lights of an armored car iluminated both her and him.


""OI! Drop the knife, and on the ground!"" A scratchy voice shouted.


There was no noise for a moment. Then Julia heard John run, then a single snapping thundering noise. Then gurgles and the sound of a bolt slotting another round in place.


""Feckin' slummers..."" she heard the scratching voice and bootsteps.


Julia was frozen on the ground. She had no clue what would happen now. She had heard of beatings done by the patrols, and the fact they just casually shot John didn't convince her fate would be much better.


""You. No, stay on the ground. Paul get the lad's knife and the handcuffs, we are taking this one for questioning."" 


""...What will happen to me?"" she asked while on the ground.


""Interrogation for why you violated the curfew."" The scratchy voice replied.


She was then handcuffed and lead to the car by the scratched voice man. The other man, Paul; came back with the knife shortly after. The car then slowly started rolling away up the street, making a slight turn as not to go over the by now breathless John, face down and in a puddle of blood.

Her body was telling her yes, but her mind was telling her no due to a feeling she had when her friend asked her if she could see us together forever. Bearing in mind we are both mid-30’s w/ kids. 

We didn’t speak for the first two weeks then on the third week I reacted to one of her Instagram stories, and we went back and forth like that for few days, liking then commenting back etc. She responded to one of mine, I liked it & then the next day she went completely AWOL, hasn’t been online since last Tuesday on either her personal or business accounts, no likes, no posts & she posts continuously on her business account.

I still love her, and on reflection I should have messaged to just say “are we going to keep liking each others stuff, or are we going to grab a coffee?” Or something, but I’ve been very much in the camp of ‘she’s the one that separated from me due to how she was feeling, and so if that feeling has changed then she should ask to talk’ as I’ve been in a situation before where someone has broken up with me, I’ve asked to rekindle & they rejected me again, my self-worth fell off massively & I regret making that choice still to this day.

Anyway, I’ll continue. I have a personalised birthday present for her which I’m going to give her as it’s of her & the kids. I msg’d her yesterday for the first time in 3 weeks via WhatsApp saying I have her present I bought a while back, it comes w no expectations etc I just want her to have it & I can drop it off when she’s not there if it’s easier. She said she would want to be there to say thank you, so I’ve said I’ll let her know when I’m going to drop it off so she can be there as it would be nice to see her, this is likely going to be next week as I’m away with work. 

She reacted with a smiley face to my message, which stung considering all of the reacting etc we were doing on Instagram. It feels like when I didn’t respond to her message, and I simply liked it, she was hoping I was going to reach out to rekindle, and when I didn’t she took it personally & deleted Instagram for a break.

How should I approach this situation? The next engagement I have with her if when I go to drop off her present, I want to keep my self-worth intact so I’m going to match her energy & keep it short, not going to talk about anything emotional etc unless she brings it up.

I want to talk to her, there is an event in December that she would love, I want to invite her to it by saying something cheeky like “Birthday present is sorted, how about an early Christmas present?” & forward her the event. But again, self-worth.

1gu0yk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/baristaexpress/comments/1gu0yk2/breville_barista_express_order_waiting_time/,Breville Barista Express - order & waiting time between expresso & milk frothing ,"Hi, 

I've finally moved to a bigger flat and have space in the new kitchen to fulfill my dream: a real coffee machine! I've been working in cafés a couple of years in the past and can make a decent espresso/latte art. Though I can definitely enjoy a proper espresso, I also often drink latte drinks and we often have guests, so I'm looking for something that could deliver consistent quality without long waiting times. I've done some research and saw quite a couple of machines which sound really great, but they all have the same problem: long waiting times between espresso & milk steaming. The only alternative I've found was double boilers, which all start at around 3x my budget (1,500€ upwards, in Germany).

Someone told be the Breville Barista Express could be the machine I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit skeptical and wanted to ask experienced users:

\- can I pull a shot after frothing milk? or do I need to wait/run water through the system for the machine to cool down, in order to reach the right temperature? doing both in parallel is obviously impossible, but I wanted to ask if the order matters here and if I should expect long waiting time in between.

\- is the machine really capable of making several (incl. latte) drinks one after the other? Or do I have to disappear to the kitchen for 20 minutes and come back with half-cold drinks, as I´ve heard is the case with some machines?

  
Thank you so much in advance!

Good to mention: I was having a cold for some days prior starting the meds, still not fully recovered. Also I got on my period two days ago (typically accompanied by low mood, head- and bellypain), so these two factors make it a bit harder for me to distinguish which symptoms are caused by the meds and which come from being sick/pms. But also: Despite these not ideal starting conditions I'm feeling pretty good!

Positive effects I noticed already from **day one**:

\- less social anxiety. My erythrophobia is way easier to handle! Suffering from this for 10+ years already, usually peaking pre-menstruation. I can handle coffee a lot better also (I usually get some anxiety with my first cup already)

\- chronic headaches calming down. I'm having these for around 8 years, daily and more prominent again since June. I'm really surprised the meds are affecting these so strong and positively.

\- feeling more happy and motivated, less depressed, despite sickness and menstruating - so surprising.

\- falling asleep is easier and I sleep a lot deeper, chronic tinnitus is disturbing me less in silence

Some side effects I'm feeling are:

\- nausea, I have to eat every 2-3 hours, then it's gone immediately. Getting better everyday.

\- light dissociation, dizzyness, unfocused (noticable especially in converasations and while driving a car - won't drive till I'm feeling more focused again)

\- restlessness coming in phases during the day

What helps me when I'm feeling some nervousness creeping in is definitely moving my body somehow, like going for a walk, cleaning, staying busy in some way. Just laying in bed thinking/not moving makes it way worse.

Overall I'm pretty surprised of how fast it works already in such low dose - at this point the positive effects definitely outweigh the negative ones.

My client is super bait and may mga Filipino employee din sila na direct hired first time lang nila kumuha under sa isang agency I don't know why pero siguro gusto lang nila ma try.
First 3 months pinag tiisan ko ang basic pay nila na almost 500 lang plus 50 pesos attendance bonus and  3k commission na hindi mo makukuha whenever may absences ka, late or may hindi na follow sa policy nila including chewing bubble gum inside the station. 
Sobrang liit kung tutuusin. Pinag tiisan ko lang dahil gusto kong mag ka experience. 
After 3 months doon nila dinisclose na premium raw ang payment ni client so for sure it is $1500 or more. That is also the time na nag increase sila sa basic salary ko naging 900 pesos na daily plus 5K commission. 
Pero I don't know if it is worth to stay pa lalo na madaling Araw ang start ang shift ko and delikado na mag commute lalo na babae ako. 1 year pa pala ako sa company na ito but what really exhausting is their policy maraming bawal pati sa damit mo maraming bawal and we are only allowed to bring coffee inside our station.
I am planning to resign next year pero nasasayangan ako sa client ko dahil sobrang bait at understanding. Palagi pa akong naka ka received ng compliment from them and I know it's rare to find a client na sobrang appreciative like them.

I’m really struggling and need some advice. I’ve been dealing with a skin nightmare for the last four months, and I’m at my wit’s end.

It all started with a few tiny white bumps on my chin (they way not visible but I could feel them). I started to exfoliated more, thinking that would help. This led to redness, and eventually, I was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis (I am not sure that diagnosis was ever correct). I stopped my entire skincare routine and went super basic, but it didn’t seem to improve. I was prescribed topical antibiotics by two dermatologists, but both made my skin even more irritated, so I stopped taking them.

The bumps never really went away, and last week, everything got inflamed from one day to the next. I can’t exactly pinpoint what triggered it. I had my period, i also wore a mineral make up and had coffee (which I try to avoid).

It looks pretty bad now. It hurts too with a stinging sensation. I’m starting to doubt it’s perioral dermatitis and wonder if it might actually be folliculitis. I have had increased hair growth on my chin and those bumps literally sit right on the chin. 

I also have tiny white raised white micro bumps all over my face (impossible to photograph), redness, and some white patches that almost look like tinea. Sometimes my face tingles all over. My oil production has been absolutely out of control and I now have dandruff too which I never had before!

Does this look like folliculitis to anyone? I’ve been using azelaic acid on it as a spot treatment, and it seems to help but I’m not sure what’s really going on here and how to calm this down quickly. I am supposed to go away on a work trip in a day. :(

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",1,1731921047.0,Folliculitis,0,1.0,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Its all thanks to fasting. If i feel prodrome I'll immediately fast for 26-30 hours, break my fast, and if i feel prodrome after eating ill fast again for another 24-36 hours.

 I've read the study on herpes and fasting linked somewhere on this sub and understand that this only really works for people with hsv-1 and not 2 so I feel I should mention that. If you have hsv-1 and are struggling with frequent OB's i would highly recommend fasting for periods longer than 20 hours, whether that be intermittent fasting or long water fasts. 

When I fast I drink heaps of water, coffee, tea, and take lysine and valtrex. Lysine is an amino acid that wont break your fast like some other supplements can so its perfect to combine with fasting.  


I have tried every vitamin, topical treatment, diet regime and lifestyle change and this is the only thing that has given me serious, life-changing results for my frequent ob's. I cant recommend fasting for hsv-1 enough",1,1731920854.0,Herpes,0,1.0,False

Chemistry was strong and there was mutual attraction. I'd had a rotten 3 years before meeting her and to be honest thought I was finished, when we first met I may have not been in the best mental state. The transformative effect of her influence on me was incredible to the point where I lost a load of weight, bought new clothes and found the old me again. I tried to ask her out but she said ""I don't want a boyfriend"", which is fair enough. We stayed in contact and went for the odd drink and coffee, I sometimes took her for dinner to treat her 'like a lady'. I had such an ego boost from being with this stunning woman. However deep down I knew it wasn't going anywhere, at the time I could deal with that. Some of my thoughts were almost limmerant and I built her up in my mind, I waited on tenter hooks for replies and listened to every word.

  
Fast forward a few months, I had been doing some work with her and saw a few of her friends, she wasn't present and we were chatting. I was complimenting how wonderful this woman was and then as I left and walked back with one of the guys who seemed perfectly nice that he was seeing her. While I am pleased for her and him, it has completely ripped my heart out. I don't want to be an idiot to her or him as thats not my style, people need to mutually love. I clearly wasn't what she wanted.

I've hardly slept since I found this out, she was so special to me and I'm struggling to deal with this. We get on so well and she wants to be friends, but I don't really know how to navigate the next week where I will see her twice, one time with her new boyfriend. I know we can't force others to love us back even if we want to. I think I am just mega hurt, never met a woman like her before.

Hello everyone! I went to the ER earlier today after 3 days of heavy visual and audio hallucinations. On the third day of not knowing anything and finally feeling seemingly back to normal, I got in my car to go get coffee and the left side of my face started going numb (felt very slight drooping) including the inside of my mouth and tongue. I immediately went too the er. I was trying to answer all questions and explain how this wasn’t a typical withdrawal I had experience me/felt in the last. I was basically looked at like I was searching for drugs when I was in complete distress and just trying to exclaim everything that was going on. I did also have them do a catscan. I am so glad (truly)  I finally think I know that I wasn’t just feeling like I was going absolutely insane or having a stroke. When I first started typing this out, I felt pretty good. Like the audio hallucinations have come down a lot and same with the visuals. But they definitely seem to just come and go still. I believe my specific situation was brought on by 5+ days of heavy drinking and a bump of Coke also followed by quitting cold turkey. Currently, it is using my mom’s voice to scream and cry at me over and over that she needs my help and to come find her. And random loud bangs. Honestly, this is terrifying. I hope by tomorrow things are better. Is there any reason to go back to the hospital tonight? Or is it safe to “tough it out”? I haven’t been able to sleep at all. And I am still seeing some scary visuals. Thank you! I apologize for the longer read. ",1,1731920721.0,alcoholicsanonymous,0,1.0,False
1gu0pbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gu0pbi/what_my_dietitian_taught_me/,What my dietitian taught me,"I live in New Zealand, am 35 years old, have a 7 year old and a 3 year old, I am 165cm and until recently weighed 87KG which classes me as obese.

I’ve always been slightly overweight according to my BMI I should be at 68KGs but usually I would sit around the 72KG mark. I’d even got myself back down to this after my second child but some how without even really knowing how just enjoying food, drinking, being busy, stressed with work and life I’d shot up again. I could no longer fit my clothes and I’d noticed pain in the joints of my feet.

It felt like the harder I tried the more weight I put on, finally I forked out an arm and a leg and paid a dietician for professional advice after trying and failing everything, here is what a learned:

❌ do not drink protein shakes, these are way to high in calories and are made for males who are 25 doing 3 hours of exercise a day.
❌ fat is fat - olive oil, nuts, seeds all need to be consumed in limitation. When frying pour oil on a paper towel and wipe it on wipe it off the pan. When putting butter on toast - wipe it on, wipe it off. Opt for lean meat and cut the fat off if it’s still on.
❌ don’t fast, keep on top of hunger before it gets on top of you.
❌ preferably no evening snacking, opt for a small piece of fruit or you must
❌ don’t cut carbs, you need them for your quick energy, carbs give you around 2 hours of energy and then your body will look for protein to burn. If there are no carbs it will just look for protein which means you then need to eat more protein which increases your calories and fat intake.

✔️ opt for trim milk in your tea and coffee instead of alternative milk, it’s high in protein and low in fat and will fill you up just that much longer - e.g. good for morning tea.
✔️ for each meal think, carbs (1/3 a cup), protein (1/2 a cup) and unrestricted vegetables (almost all veges, noting she classifies potatoes and kumara as carbs).
✔️ I have high muscle density so a small pottle of yoghurt for afternoon tea will be needed to see me through the afternoon without getting hungry.
✔️ half an hour of power walking everyday - aim for 3.5KM in 30mins no more otherwise it will stimulate my appetite.
✔️ time matters, breakfast at 8/8:30, lunch at 12:30, afternoon tea at 3pm and dinner at 6.

Limit alcohol to 2 drinks a week.
No sugar or treats until you’ve lost the weight.

So how am I going? Well it’s almost been three weeks now, I’ve lost 5KGs. Unfortunately I had 2 few birthdays and social occasions I had 4-5 drinks at and one involved some pizza. I also had a colonoscopy which meant I was off the diet for about 4 days.

I have my weigh in on Thursday where she will measure my body fat percentage. She wanted me to loose 10KG and right now I feel with another 3-4 weeks this maybe possible!

I wanted to share this as I feel like I’ve drowned in so much misinformation trying to loose weight and only ever got heavier. Wish you all the best!",7,1731920713.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

I live in a city and get a ton of ""rejections"" at stores, food places and restaurants when I try to pay cash. This heavily bothers me, cause if I understand the law right, they are not even allowed to refuse cash money, right? I prefer to use cash and I know there's plenty of people out there who do to, especially older people. It bothers me so much when I stand there with the exact amount of cash ready in hand and they look at you as if you are a creep and say ""we don't do cash here"". I even go out of my way to always pay the exact amount so they don't have to give me any change. One time I had forgotten my bank card at home and I only had cash, and these people made me go back home to come back with a bank card instead of cash, so they're not even willing to accept it when it is the only option.

I don't like making a scene and just give in and pay by card, because I know the employees do not determine this rule and they might get in trouble if they do accept cash from people. But really, is there nothing that can be done about this? It feels stupid to pull out my bank card for a 3 euro coffee. For large amounts of money, I get it. But I am talking about small groceries or just a quick bite or drink here.

I don't want arguments that explain why card or payconiq is the better option in people's opinion (I already use those most of the time as 50% of the places I go don't accept cash), I just want to know, is anyone else bothered by this? And is this even allowed at all?

Nepal has been number 1 on my bucket list for 15+ years, so why not end the DN journey with a bang?

Kathmandu:

I lasted 6 days before leaving for Pokhara. Most people I met last a day or two tops. The honking was fucking relentless. There was only about a 6 hour per from 11pm - 5am where it was quiet enough to sleep. After that it was game on.

I’ve also never been approached/harassed so many times by locals trying to sell me drugs. Every corner, following me on my way to breakfast at 8am, when I was sitting in a cafe drinking coffee. Nonstop. On the 3rd day I had a younger guy walk beside me, claiming there was a holiday and the road ahead was blocked off by a parade (there wasn’t) while trying to redirect me to his art shop. I went on my way, got breakfast, only to have his colleague pull the same stunt on the way back only to stop when I went inside my hostel. I left my hostel sparingly after day 3.

Quick note: I met a lot of people who refused to fly in country due to the accidents. Honestly, the roads aren’t much better and the drivers are very, very, aggressive. A flight from KTM to Pokhara is 25 min. A bus ride is 8-10 hours. Fly, the mountainside views are awesome.

Pokhara:

This is where I spent a majority of my time. I think this place has great potential to be a digital nomad spot for the future, however, I only found a few other nomads in my 2ish months here. The majority of people I met fell into two categories: Trekkers (very short term) and backpackers (medium term).

I ended up staying at hostels with private rooms. Cost lakeside (tourism heavy) was anywhere from $16-24/night, including breakfast. I stayed at a few hotels that were in the low $30/night and didn’t see much of a difference than the private rooms. I stayed in hostels/hotels closer to damside as it was a little quieter. The heart of lakeside has a lot of bars and restaurant, which means noise. 1-2 bedroom apartments were going for $200-250/month from word of mouth.

Food ranges $1-5 for a plate. Rarely did I spend more than $7-8 at a sit down restaurant for meal + drink. I think the most I paid was $14 and I was shocked lol. But at the same token, I contracted aggressive typhoid after eating too much street food. That’s the risk.

I arrived in mid Sept towards the end of rainy season. It was very hot, humid, and swampy. Dengue was a problem. And then it rained for 4 straight days. Torrential downpours at times, never seen anything like it. I wasn’t surprised to hear about the flooding in other areas, including Kathmandu. The weather has gradually cooled and now a sweater is needed in the evening.

Other things: There are 2 main gyms in touristy Pokhara. Both are fine, but a little pricey for day and week passes. Motorcycle rentals suck. Foreigners can’t buy without a letter from their embassy (or something like this?) so rental prices are inflated to $15-$30/day. Roads are rough - would only recommend riding here if you have years of experience. Power cuts are common, but most hotels have backup generator. Internet stays on.

Guides for treks are absolutely NOT needed for Annapurna! The law that made headlines a year ago was reversed. Yes, there are some restricted treks, but guides have been needed for those for years. But for just a regular trek? No. I was never asked at checkpoints for my guide. And frankly, I heard way more negative stories from people who felt their guides were too pushy. I did Mardi Himal solo and saw groups who were large distances ahead of their guides. Everything is clearly marked, there is no need for a babysitter.

Would I recommend Nepal? Yes, but only if you can take time off. There is so much to see! The trekking, the national parks, the adventures! Heck, I didn’t even mention Chitwan, Rara Lake, Upper Mustang, and more! But it takes time, and weekends for 9-5 DN (like myself) is not enough.

And so that’s the end of my DN journey. I haven’t stayed in one place longer than 6 months in years. I no longer have that “wonder” feeling of going to a new country. Honestly, this was a negative on my time in Nepal as I settled into a work routine. I wish I had come here purely for vacation.

Below, we explore five compelling reasons why your small business should consider partnering with **coffee-tea vending machine dealers** For small businesses, creating a comfortable and productive work environment is key to success. A coffee-tea vending machine is an often overlooked yet impactful addition to any workplace C[**offee-tea vending machine**](https://cafedesireonline.com/collections/coffee-tea-vending-machine-premix). These machines are not just about serving hot beverages; they represent convenience, cost-effectiveness, and an investment in employee satisfaction. Below, we explore five compelling reasons why your small business should consider partnering with **coffee-tea vending machine dealers** and installing one in your office.



1. **Boosts Employee Productivity and Morale**

A happy and energised workforce is a productive one. Providing quick access to coffee or tea allows employees to recharge during breaks without leaving the office. A [**coffee-tea vending machine for offices**](https://cafedesireonline.com/collections/coffee-tea-vending-machine-premix) ensures employees can enjoy a hot cup of their favourite beverage without wasting time queuing at nearby cafes. This convenience enhances efficiency and demonstrates your care for employee well-being, boosting morale in the process.

2. **Cost-Effective Refreshment Solution**

Investing in a [**tea-coffee vending machine**](https://cafedesireonline.com/blogs/company-and-its-products/https%20://wa.me/919000061547) is a cost-efficient way to provide beverages for your team. Traditional methods, such as hiring staff to prepare drinks or offering stocked kitchenettes, can be expensive and inefficient. With a vending machine, you only pay for the machine and its supplies, with minimal maintenance costs. Additionally, many **coffee tea vending machine dealers** offer flexible pricing options to suit your budget, making it an affordable choice for small businesses.

3. **Improves Client and Visitor Experience**

First impressions matter, especially when dealing with clients and visitors.

It reflects professionalism and attention to detail, which can go a long way in building lasting relationships. A vending machine provides an easy and hygienic way to serve drinks without additional staff or preparation time.

4. **Encourages Healthier Workplace Habits**

Tea and coffee are more than just popular beverages—they can have health benefits too. Tea, for instance, is rich in antioxidants, while coffee is known for boosting energy and focus. A **tea-coffee vending machine** ensures employees have access to healthier drink options than sugary alternatives like sodas. By investing in a vending machine, you’re promoting a balanced lifestyle, which can positively impact overall employee health and reduce workplace fatigue.

5. **Convenience and Minimal Maintenance**

The modern **coffee tea vending machine for offices** is designed for ease of use and low maintenance. These machines are equipped with user-friendly interfaces and automated cleaning functions, saving time and effort. Most **coffee tea vending machine dealers** also provide servicing packages, ensuring your machine remains in top condition without the need for constant supervision. This hassle-free convenience makes it an ideal addition to small business settings.

(Talking to the friend that can't breath) Hello my name is (insert asmrtist name) and I'm a doctor, I'm gonna help you.

(Concerned) Your face looks a bit swollen.

Can you open your mouth for me and stick your tongue out please? 

This looks like an allergic reaction. 

(Talking to her) Are you allergic to anything. 

(Worried accelerated) Nuts?!?! 

(More worried accelerated) Did you eat the chocolate cake? 

(Bad news) Oh god.

(Worried demanding) John! I need you to call an ambulance now! 

(Keeping the calm for her and comforting while being serious) You're gonna be ok but I need you to stay calm please. 

Do you carry an epi pen with you? 

Ok, where is it? 

(Rethoric) On your bag, front pocket.....alright I got it. 

Can you tell me your name? 

Ok , it's gonna be fine. 

I'm gonna apply the epi pen on your thigh now ok? 

You can stay sitted that's fine.

(Worried serious) John, did you call for that ambulance? 

(Rethoric) They're on their way? Ok thanks man. 

(Talking to the woman again) Here we go... 

(You stab her with the epi) 

There....it's gonna be ok alright...I need you to stay calm. Niiice deep breaths for me....

I know, I know it's hard to breath right now, but you're breathing too fast and that's not gonna help. 

(Talking to her friend serious) Hey , Hey, if you panic, you're not gonna help your friend here  Ok?. You need to stay calm please. 

(Someone needs to calm the panicked friend) John! Could you stay with her friend please, her panic and yelling is seriously not helping! 

(Mad worried) Damn it! Pulse is accelerating and the swelling is not going down! 

Where is that ambulance??!!!! 

(Comforting while worried) Hey, it's gonna be ok, that's it keep breathing nice and a slowly..

(Asking the paramedics) Vitals? 

Pressure's 63/95......lend me your sthetoscopoe....

(Talking to her) I'm gonna take a listen to your heart and lungs now.

(Talking to the paramedics) Upper airways sound constricted, it's still not working. 

I need half a miligram of adrenaline.

(Talking to her) We're gonna give you adrenaline through a small injection in your arm ok? 

Alright, There we go. 

(She starts shaking badly all over) 

(Comforting) Hey hey, don't panic it's ok, I know you're shaking a lot, but that's a normal reaction to the adrenaline.

I know, it's scary, but you're gonna be fine. It's just temporary ok? 

Are you in any pain right now? 

(Rethoric) No? 

That's good. 

(Talking to the paramedics) How far are we? 

(Rethoric) 2 minutes? Ok. 

(Talking to her) Are you feeling any better? 

A bit? That's a good sign. 

[End of acceleration you can start to slow down] 

I'm gonna remove the mask for a moment and I need you to open your mouth for me and stick your tongue out once again please.

Alright.

(Relieved) (Sigh)  Swelling is starting to go down. 

Alright I'm gonna put the mask back on. 

You're gonna be fine. 

We're almost there 

We're gonna get you admitted alright?

The swelling is going down but I need to check on your vitals again and make sure you're ok. 

I need to keep you monitored for a while until I make sure you're ok to go home. 

(Rethoric) Can your throat close back again? 

It's unusual but it's not impossible which is why I wanna keep an eye on you for a bit ok? 

(She panics) Hey, hey....it's very unlikely..and if it does, I'll be right there. Don't worry please. 

(Nice) Hey there's no need to thank me please, I'm glad I was there at the right moment.

So just as I’m drifting off to sleep after hours of trying, I’ll slightly open my eyes to experience one of a few things. 

I will see: 
1. A bug crawling in my bed. 
2. A thick cloud of gnats settling down over my face. 
3. A spider hovering down over me. 

All of these hallucinations are real enough to wake me out of a near sleep state of relaxation, and send me running across the room or scrambling and falling off a bed or couch. Sometimes it takes me a few moments of turning on the light and searching for whatever I saw to realize it was never real, forcing me to start over in trying to calm down and get back to sleep from my full fledged adrenaline dump. 

Tonight was a little different. 3 hours of fighting to fall asleep, (meditation, rain sounds, old cartoons, etc…) and I finally started to drift off when I suddenly opened my eyes and saw movement crouched down behind a kitchenette table 15 feet from me. 

I’m currently couch surfing in someone’s home and they stayed elsewhere overnight. But the movement was real and scary enough to me, that I grabbed my g*n off the coffee table and drew down on the figure. The closer I got, the less movement I saw and quickly realized what happened and just about collapsed from the adrenaline. 

Im currently on medication for high BP and depression. This has undoubtedly been one of the hardest years of my life and I have no doubt that it’s related to these hallucinations. I just want to know if there’s a name for it and how to help it. ",1,1731917809.0,sleepdisorders,1,1.0,False
1gu01rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoPoker/comments/1gu01rp/live_poker_in_manila/,Live Poker In Manila,"In some respects Manila is a truly awful city. It is crowded, the traffic is bad, and the food is gawdy. Despite the negatives, Manila is quickly becoming a prime location for poker players. Let's talk about the games.

The action is good. You can find games in card rooms with blinds as low as 10/20 PHP. (Yes, that's a 40 cent big blind). At the upper end you can find games with blinds like 5/10 and 10/20 USD. And there is a whole lot in between. Manila poker has something for everyone.

The bulk of the action is 25/50, 50/100, and 100/200. That's like .5/1, 1/2, and 2/4. The rake is 10% and the cap is based on the blinds. 25/50 has a 300 cap, 50/100 is 400, 100/200 is 500. This rake is fairly competitive by international standards, and gets even better because you don't have to tip. Not the dealer and not the waitresses.

Alright, enough generalities. Let's talk specifics.

Newport World Resorts

Located minutes from Terminal 3, Newport World Resorts is one of Manila's premier casino complexes. The poker room has 14 tables and has action going 24/7. The lowest buy in table is 50/100, with a 5k min and a 30k max. During peak hours there will usually be 5-6 tables of each 50/100 and 100/200 and usually a 200/400 or 300/600 as well. Sometimes they play 100/200/400 PLO with a minimum buyin of 50,000.

The action at 50/100 is generally quite good, although sometimes it gets a little nitty.

For grinders looking for a long term place to stay, you can get a month to month rental within Newport city at a very affordable rate, like 20000 or 25,000 PHP. Space is at a premium in manila so the condos aren't spacious or anything but they have decent amenities and you can walk to the poker room.

  
Okada Manila

For the microballers among us, Okada offers games starting at 25/50, going as high as 500/1000. But 50/100 and 100/200 run daily, and 200/400+ it all depends. Overall i it is a pretty good poker room. The drink service is marginal, the servers don't come around very much. You also cannot get free black coffee, which is quite bizarre for a poker room. They do offer free coffee, but it is 2 in 1, and not very good. However you can get a very nice free hot tea with no sugar or cream added to it. It's a black tea, like English breakfast or whatever. 

There is a food court with some decent options, and even Jollibee if you are willing to take the 5 minute hike. Pollo Loko is nice too if you have a craving for tortillas. 

The 25/50 is min 1000 and max 5000 and plays pretty small. The 50/100 is min 5000 and max 30,000 and usually plays relatively large. Straddles are frequent, and the games attract a lot of aggressive players. The 100/200 is hit and miss and can be pretty tough. 

Okada also offers frequent tournament series which are ran by PokerStars, and well worth checking out for the serious tournament players.

  
Red Dragon

  
Red Dragon is located in Malate at the New Coast Hotel. The casino in which Red Dragon Poker room operates is now named LaVie Resort and Casino. Formerly it was known as Casino Filipino Malate, but PAGCOR is privatizing all its government ran casinos and transitioning to more of a regulatory regime. Red Dragon runs 50/100 and 100/200 NLHE with just a few tables. They are also talking about bringing back comps. The action here is decent but the room can get a bit smoky and there are usually just one or two tables running. The food is catered by New Coast so pretty good, but the area surrounding the casino is pretty sketchy. Games get going in the early evening (5 pm onwards).

  
Soul Poker in City of Dreams

  
Soul Poker is Manila's newest poker room. They run 25/50, 50/100, and 100/200. Good drink service, and right near Okada so you can always bounce if the action is dead. Worth checking out and good for low rollers as well.

  
2Ace (Formerly GG Poker)

2 Ace is a stand alone card room. Actually they get a lot of tables here. Blinds start at 25/50 with lots of variation in between (50/100, 100/100, 100/200, occassionaly plo or badugi). 10k max on the 25/50 too for deep stack play. Lots of fish, you can also order grab food which is nice",1,1731917614.0,AlgoPoker,0,1.0,False

Mixed feelings about it, as it was a nice reward that I used every week. Hopefully they’ll replace it with something equivalent.",2,1731917603.0,ThreeUK,0,1.0,False
