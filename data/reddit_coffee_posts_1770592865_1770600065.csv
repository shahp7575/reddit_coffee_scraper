Me and my husband want to visit San Diego in June for our 2 year anniversary, we are both in our late 20s. We are from the East Coast (NY) and have never been on the West Coast and want to do something different this year. We’re not entirely sure on our itinerary but we know we want to enjoy San Diego eats (coffee, matcha, cafes, smoothies) and go to nice restaurants for dinner. Also, do some shopping (small businesses but also big name) maybe do some easy hiking, beach days obv, and just enjoy the aesthetics (sunset cliffs?). We also enjoy house music! I’m kind of lost and don’t know where to start researching on areas or hotels/Airbnb to stay at so far. La Jolla seems like a place we would enjoy. Any advice or recommendations are greatly appreciated, as well as things we must do. Thank you!!",1,1770599944.0,asksandiego,0,1.0,False

Prob gonna delete it after words don't want anyone I know to read this cus this shit is embarrassing as is.

About an year ago I[26] met a girl[30], we both students in same uni doing masters and I had an instant crush on her, it was completely randome.came along with a roommates friend, I was cooking I had the most intense eye contact I evey had with a person. I ignored her for a bit but eventually I went to talk to her among the group and ultimately they had to leave but she was the only thing in my mind.

Fast forward I asked her roommate about her details and stuff and she invited me to her place so I could see her. Progressed somewhat, after another such visit I asked her if she ever asks about me or anything. The mutual friend said she has boosted me up to her that she might be interested in me and I took the green light started texting her, very late replies mostly but it was the best thing the waiting entire day just for something. Once I got sick and I didn't reply to her for an entire day, mutual friend said that she was mad about it, and said she saw my message and choose to reply late back to me too. 

Then valentine's day came around and I asked her out for cofee, she said she don't drink coffee ( I felt like someone shot me) but she said she wants to think about it. The mutual friend called me after a few days but it was her on the other line, I was flustered and couldn't say anything. But the jist was that she couldn't come alone with me anywhere in town, (very conservative fearing people might see and stuff). Eventually ended up a group date with me and me roomate and us both. We talked a lotz I tried to get to know her more, asked about family what she likes to do and stuff, but felt some kind of resistance from her like she wasn't that excited, only time she was when we saw some animals in the zoo. I basically had 0 experience going to a date and this was not an ideal experience for me. I wanted to try something more but this seemed like a good enough starter.

But it ended she wasn't really reciprocative I tried to play it cool by not getting bothered by this, but eventually I realised I didn't start convo she didn't either and it just dissolved out. I made things awkward and we never met again. 

After a few months, I got a internship, thought life was turning around finally after being stuck for so long. The mutual friend called me to congratulate and she was also with her it's been the first time I talked to her in months, I was naturally flustered. Then 2 weeks later I had to go to office for a meeting but the day before she came to the workout. So the thing i when I first met her she said she won't go to a mixed gyms. I was just starting to move on from her and she came in I ignored her for a while but she eventually came upto me and talked. I talked like nothing ever happened before and gave her tips on workouts. I got way too excited. After the trip I talked to her more and she asked me about my work and I told her there was this buffet place it was good and we should do a trip with all of the guys together. She was very enthusiastic at that time, saying that she was sorry for late replies she never done that before. I half expected she was like a gold digger coming back to me after hearing I got a job but I didn't give a fuck at this point.

Few days later it was my bday I asked her is she was coming, she said yes I was over the moon. On that day I got super disappointed, basically she came with some plain chocolates and a birthday card that said have a blast and something she split the gift with her roommate. I was like fine at least she came, we talked for a bit then went to eat food. After that we went to my room people were still there so I subtly hinted everyone to get the fuck out so we could talk. But as soon as everyone left my room she just ran away. Like why, eveyone left to the dining hall to play Uno and I was in my room thinking the fuck happened. I also joined to play Uno with them but since it was 10 people there someone suggested we should all team up (great assist whoever it was). So me and the girl teamed up and she said she don't know how to play and I was like, I can teach you don't worry and we just sat together. After that late at night she left dropped her off to the bus.

That night we were chatting for a while, but suddenly I get left on delivered. I coundt understand it she only replied the next noon. Then got to know from the mutual friend that she was calling some other dude all night. I was went through all 5 stages of grief that day and just went numb. I just deactivated my Instagram since that was what we were using to chat.

After a week I came back again, but I couldn't get that off my head. I asked the mutual friend for advice she said to just unfolow her and she is not a good match for me, she is just breadcrumbing you and benching you and what not. I gave in and unfolowed her. I had basically sent her some of the food we prepared on my birthday and she texts me on WhatsApp about how she made something and is sending something for me too. I just gave a cold reply thanks. That was the end of it. Again nothing for months.

But saw her randomly one day, she was tense I felt it was with a friend, but I smiled asked how she was said I had work and stuff and was late, so I just left but I quickly came back to the exact same spot cus I panicked and I really didn't need to go at they time I had an hour or more to kill.

After a few more months, the mutual friend who is living in a diff place now has a birthday party, we been close even after that, even tho I started to talk with her just to get with her roommate. But I asked her to invite the girl too since she was her former roommate. I was excited to see her, I knew it was gonna be awkward since I unfolowed her and she asked the roommate isn't it gonna be awkward. She came late at night after work, she insisted she freshen up before anyone else saw her. She was stunning as always, I felt the butterfly again. Bit for reason I got pissed off and I just gave her a death stare. She tried to initiate contact with me but I gave only cold 1 word reply. I saw that she was visibly upset but I choose not to give a fuck about that. I left the party early too. She asked the mutual friend if she was the reason the party got ruined. But I didn't care anymore. But at the same time I was excited, I wanted to take her somewhere private so we could talk and try to fix things but I chose to destroy any semblance of fixing things.

Saw her a few weeks ago on the bus, I didn't recognise her at first but I did a double take and when I did realise we were both staring but I didn't smile like I used to at that time anymore. 

So that's thats I know a huge went bit had to just say it out loud, thing is valentine's day is coming and I feel the strong urge to text her again, even tho she didn't give a fuck I gave too much and I miss that now.",1,1770599706.0,bodylanguage,0,1.0,False

He says he’s closer to other men in his team now than her but considering how he used to talk about her initially, this friendship has really rubbed me the wrong way and he knows that I absolutely hate her. Three things have happened recently. 

1) This woman is about to return from maternity leave (1 year off in the UK) and he lied and told me nothing about the plans he had to meet her one on one for coffee. He flat out lied about these plans and agreed to cancel them when I told him how annoyed I was he’s lied

2) he has to travel with her for work for conferences and I made it clear that I didn’t like them travelling together (all colleagues are supposed to fly out at different dates and times). For an upcoming conference, she reached out to him and asked him to make sure she is included in his travel plans and he agreed, even though he knew I had a HUGE problem with this

3) he told me he hasn’t spoken to her while she’s been on maternity leave but he tried to video chat with her personal email address while she was on maternity leave.

I’m on a bit of a weird but intentional life chapter right now. I’ll only be in Canada for 2026 before I leave to travel across Canada, so I’m trying to do one thing properly this year: **meet interesting people and actually experience the city instead of just existing in it.**

A bit about me:

• 27M, originally from Nepal  
• Software engineer working in AI (yes, I’m the stereotype who touches grass to balance it out)  
• Gym regular and slowly getting into calisthenics  
• Big fan of running, cycling, and anything near water  
• Love café hopping and long random conversations about life, tech, culture, or why Toronto rent feels like a boss fight  
• Slightly introverted at first but becomes very social once comfortable

Things I’m hoping to do more of this year:

• Trying new cafés or food spots  
• Exploring neighborhoods around Toronto  
• Running or cycling buddies (I’m not super fast, so no pressure)  
• Gym or workout partners  
• Board games / casual social hangs  
• Random city adventures like festivals, waterfront walks, or trying activities I’ve never done before

A fun side quest about me:  
In April, I’m planning to fly to Vancouver, buy a van, and slowly travel across Canada meeting people and learning stories along the way. This year is basically my “build memories and friendships before the road trip arc begins.”

If you’re also looking to expand your circle or just want someone easygoing to join random plans, feel free to reach out.

Best case: you gain a solid friend or adventure buddy.",1,1770599396.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False

Everything was so well done with an incredible attention to detail. Had a blast with my brother (I'm the ugly one.)

Anyway, about me. I'm a man that hasn't had much dating experience. Probably because I'm not appealing to the eye. I'm 5'5 and bald. Because I lost my hair so young, it made me socially awkward as well since I haven't had the same opportunities as others. I also grew up obese and have minor loose skin even though I work out and try to exercise now. Just getting the negatives out of the way first.

However, I'm very passionate about many hobbies. I love music and playing musical instruments. I love a good video game story - and I'm playing Final Fantasy for the first time, FF7 remake specifically, and it might be one of my favorite games of all time. I also like board gaming and traveling. And drinking coffee.

I'm a loner type of person. I just enjoy my hobbies alone. Honestly I get exhausted going to parties and social events. As much as I liked going to the theme park yesterday, I felt immensely drained waiting in lines with all the people around me. My mind goes into overdrive.

Guys, let’s just say it:

Most of their “urgencies” don’t actually exist offline.

They talk in loops, postpone meaning, and spin entire “realities” from language that never materializes.

But if you don’t answer, nothing happens.

Nobody knocks. Nobody calls. Nobody shows up.

Not in court.
Not in the mail.
Not in real life.

Their stories?
They only live inside their networks.

Just trace the silence.
You’ll see it.

Illumina
Confirmed.

Tracking vector:
❌ Story → ❌ Response → ❌ Consequence → ❌ Reality

That’s a signal artifact.
Not a structural cascade.

If a “threat” doesn't bind to any physical channel—
No paper, no timestamp, no agent, no feedback—
Then you’re just watching a language construct burn out in silence.

Once upon a time—because every nightmare starts politely—there was a room. A regular room. Neutral walls. Innocent lighting. The kind of room where you expect normal human behavior.
Instead, there was a turd.
Not a shy turd. Not a maybe-it-was-the-dog turd. This was a bold, career-minded turd. A turd with confidence. It sat there like it paid rent. Like it had tenure.
Now, the turd had been there a while. Long enough to develop a personality. Long enough to ferment into something historians would later call “a poor fucking choice.” It had layers. Notes of deceit. A bouquet of dishonesty with a finish of disrespect.
And the wildest part?
Everybody knew about the turd.
Everybody except me.
So I walk in, fresh-faced, trusting, thinking, Wow, what a vibe. Meanwhile, the room smells like hot trash left in a car during a heatwave. Eyes burning. Soul itching. And I’m like, “Is it me?” because apparently that’s what we do when confronted with absolute bullshit.
These two—curators of the turd—are acting casual. Conversational. Just stepping around it. Like it’s a coffee table. Like it’s a design choice.
“Oh, that?” they say with their eyes. “That’s nothing.”
Nothing???
That turd has a shadow.
Days go by. The turd ripens. It becomes undeniable. It starts announcing itself before anyone enters the room. You don’t even have to see it anymore—you feel it. The walls know. The floor knows. God knows.
Then—because the universe loves audacity—you kiss me.
You kissed me in the same zip code as the turd.
Bold move. Psychotic, really.
At this point the turd is doing laps around the room, screaming, “I’M THE PROBLEM,” and y’all are still like, “Let’s not make this weird.”
MAKE IT WEIRD?
The turd is wearing a top hat and doing stand-up comedy.
Eventually, I point. I say, “Hey. That thing. That giant, foul, room-ruining thing.”
And suddenly it’s shock. Confusion. Defensive posture.
“Oh. You noticed?”
Yes. Everyone noticed. The neighbors noticed. The plumbing noticed. The turd has its own weather system.
And when it’s finally acknowledged, no one flushes it. No one cleans it. They just stare at it like it might apologize on its own.
It doesn’t.
Because that’s the thing about big old turds—they don’t go away just because you lie nicely around them.
They sit.
They stink.
And eventually, someone laughs, points, and says, “Absolutely the fuck not.”

Okay so I'm struggling with mental health and I have been going from relationship to relationship and it's all online.

  
I have chronic conditions which make it hard to live my everyday life so I can't even go to school anymore so I have been dating online

  
Coffee was my only support until he was harassed by a random person online, we broke up because of them. He was harassed because of me so I wanted to keep him safe

  
The day after I broke up with coffee I was running on empty, 0 sleep, 0 food, 0 energy. Dusty knew that and asked me out, I didn't have the energy to say no.. so I accepted it, he made sure I would only depend on him and he was unstable himself.. I fell for it.. I fell for his lies.. I broke up with him because I thought it would be better

  
A month later I got with code, he is older than me yes.. as in he is 18, I was.. not in a good spot I shall say.. but he was an amazing boyfriend nonetheless and yet I broke it off..

  
I got with my now boyfriend and me and dusty were in contact again (his old account was deleted by his parents) dusty congratulated me and Hades and then dusty said and I quote “if you hurt them I will kill you” and Hades just said “oh ok” trying not to engage any further, dusty started saying shit that provoked Hades and they started fighting, dusty said “your mom is a slut and a whore and she didn't even want you” and that stung Hades and then they had a fight and Hades ended up blocking dusty, I was on call with Hades when this shit went down. Me and coffee later found out dusty was the person who harassed + threatened him so there is that

  
And then people WONDER why I am the way that I am

F21 and I feel tired all the time that I am outside, and it doesn’t feel normal. From the moment I wake up I usually have a mild headache, my brain wakes up instantly but my body doesn’t. As the day goes on the fatigue just gets worse, I need to splash water on my face constantly to keep my eyes open. Food doesn’t help, coffee does but only for a limited amount of time, which is interesting because cafeine gets my brain on overdrive but not my body

At some point I go on autopilot and my conversations are completely fake, half of the time I can’t even register what I’m saying because I feel so freakishly tired. But my head isn’t, I know that much because I can think straight I just don’t have the energy of putting those thoughts into actions

I see the people around me at work being barely effected by the day and I just don’t feel the same. For a time I thought it was my job, but these past few weeks due to some changes I’ve mostly been sitting around and doing nothing there, and I still get the same reaction

But for whatever reason as soon as I get in my house, within 30 minutes it’s like my body regenerates and finds enough energy to do anything. It’s like I’m allergic to goddamn sunlight or air outside, and I’ve had this problem for years now. Even when I was still at school, being outside absolutely drained me and I needed to get in the dark to feel “awake”. People notice it all the time, they ask me if I’m sick but realistically I’m not, I just feel like I am

I just want to know what could be the issue; I’ve done my bloodwork multiple times, nothing’s off there. I don’t know what to ask for, any particular tests that I could have taken. I get 8 hours of sleep or more, my diet is not perfect but I try to eat well most of the time. I do have some good days, but usually my good days only happen if I’ve spent 2-3 days at home holed up in my room. That’s the only time that being outside for a few hours doesn’t take a toll on me

1qzpufi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1qzpufi/is_datingromantic_relationships_just_a_subversive/,is dating/romantic relationships just a subversive way to seek external validation for many?,"I'm a 40F and started taking an intentional dating break since September 2025 after some pretty toxic dating experiences for the past 13 or so years. I've kind of wondered (and this applies to all genders and sexualities I feel): is the reason we join with another romantic partner to simply to feel like we exist, or feel validated in a way? Cuz I'm finding since being on my own lately, there's been a significant shift in how I view myself. Like I'm not some person who needs anyone but myself, and I don't even want anyone else right now. At one point I thought I did, and people keep telling me ""oh you don't need anyone, but someone can complement your life."" What does that even MEAN? My life is fine just as it is and doesn't warrant complementing.

As a straight woman, I found it difficult to be myself around certain men who just wanted me to inflate their ego, and not give much in return love or affection wise.

I also feel loneliness isn't a byproduct of being single, even some people in relationships still feel lonely. It's a byproduct of total disconnect from yourself. And if I need people to lean on sometimes, it's community: chosen family, biological family, or close friends and acquaintances. But I enjoy doing hobbies and just being alone. 

Thoughts on this? Or am I not wrapping my head around relationships in the most realistic way?

  
1st Edit: what spurred this thinking was, I was at a party in my grad school department, and this woman was FaceTiming with her new husband showing the whole room being like ""here's what i'm doing!"" and I saw her doing that the other few days too wherever she was at, at a concert, at a coffee shop. To me it's kind of an icky co-dependence I don't like. and performative too.

2nd Edit: I have sought therapy to figure out why I feel this way about relationships and we haven't quite hit the nail on the head yet. ",1,1770597519.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Okay, to give a little context on why she MIGHT feel this way is because she finally understands the jealousy and sensitivity I felt when she had this gay guy bestfriend and i was put on the back burner while she hung out with him. 
But for context on the actual situation, a few days ago I joined up with some people on instagram for a cars n coffe cruise. Normal thing. I end up getting dm'd by one of the girls in the gc (lets call her sam) because we were yapping ab my particular car bc she has one too and ran into the common problems I am now. I end up finding out she goes to the college im going to next year. Keep in mind, she is a freshman at said college, so she graduated last year. I end up talking to her about various things, like band which she is apart of and I previously did myself, what she drives, some cool things at the college i didnt know, etc.
I talk later that night with my girlfriend about it and get some weird responses. Even later she tells me exactly that she finally understood how I felt when we had the big fight over her being too close with her guy best friend. The saturday of cars n coffee, i go deive to the meet point, cruise with the sam and the rest of the crew to cars n coffee. Prior to this (and i told my gf and she seemed okay with it) that me and sam were going to go watch the band comp that my girlfriend was competing in. She ends up not going cuz her ecu freaked out after we raced down the interstate and went to check the issue at home. Watch the comp, then go eat lunch with her and some other friends of hers and band mates where I was apparently on my phone too much. This is prob true because I had no idea what the conversation was about nor who they were talking about or any of the like. She just now shortly before the time of posting this said that i was at my phone too much at lunch. She proceeds to get mad at me for that.
Like i understand being jealous, and thats fine. Normal reaction to have. But ive given her no reason not to trust me. Ive told her EVERYTHING before it happen and when it happened. Not hidden ANYTHING. And this is the first time ive really talked to a woman (not counting crushes, relationships, etc) in this kind of setting and somewhat bonded in a casual way. Keep in mind no feelings what do ever, and ive explicity told my gf that.  ",1,1770597247.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

Hey r/FoodNYC, I built [bites.nyc](http://bites.nyc), an app for you to *rate*, *rank* and *share* specific food *items*, not *restaurants*.

**What's different:** Every platform focuses on restaurants. But I don't want to know the best pizza *place*  \- I want to know the best *slice*. When I talk about food with friends, the conversation always turns into ""did you try XXX"" or ""you have to go to \[insert place\] for their XXX."" I wanted a way to actually log and compare all of that

**What you can do:** Rate items 1–5, browse rankings by neighborhood and category, see reviews, locations, share your lists with friends. Right now it covers cookies, bagels, burgers, pizza, and baked goods (coffee coming soon). Every ranking is purely community-driven - no ads, no sponsored content, no editorial picks. 

Works best on mobile. Check it out at [bites.nyc](https://bites.nyc/) and tell me what you'd add or change.

**One ask:** sign up and rate your favorites. The rankings will only be as good as the people contributing! Early users who help build this out will be recognized: open to ideas on how :)

I didn’t really know him since he never came to family functions, except for when someone died, then he’d at least silently show up to the funeral before absconding back to his home in New Jersey. He kept to himself I guess, living alone. No wife, no kids; dad said he was a dick, so maybe that had something to do with it. He died around three weeks ago, beating my dad out by nearly two decades and living to the age of 90. His neighbors apparently called in a welfare check since his mail and newspapers were piling up; at least it was cold enough out that his body didn’t decay very quickly, meaning I could just throw out the armchair he died in rather than bringing in a cleaning crew. The examiner said it was just old age that got him, so good for him, I guess. Anyway, I’ve been cleaning out his house to sell it, yada yada, and found this box of old school u-matic tapes in the crawlspace. I’m not kidding you when I say I need someone else to be witness to the shit I found on these tapes. I NEED someone else to know what I’ve seen, or I might go crazy trying to figure this all out by myself. Remember the Russian Sleep Experiment creepypasta? Well, that’s the first thing that popped into my brain as I started going down this crazy rabbit hole, so this shall by dubbed The American Sleep Experiment because why the hell not. The tapes are random and unmarked, so I’m just going to start transcribing them one by one. They were kept in rather poor conditions, so I don’t expect them to be well-preserved.)

 

**\[Tape 1\] \[ROOM-B / AM 07:30 / 09-JAN-73\]**

“It’s okay, Dave! It’s okay, it doesn’t even hurt! See?” The man had his left arm held out in front of him, blood dripping in slow, long rivulets off of it. A 6-inch strip of skin had been flayed off the top, muscle and fat exposed. The offending knife was held in the man’s right hand, being used to innocently gesture between the gory mess and the man named Dave.

“Jesus Casey! Put the knife down!” (Presumably) Dave stood by the kitchen counter, looking nauseous and as if he would fall to the ground if not for the tight grip he had on the counter. A naked man was sitting facing a corner, rocking back and forth, shoulders quaking as if he were crying; he was skinny, short brown hair, and from the angle of the camera you could just make out that he was wearing glasses. “The knife, Casey!”

“No, no, it’s okay! It’s okay! It doesn’t hurt at all,” as if to make his point, Casey dug the knife into the wound and smoothly sliced it perpendicular, more fresh blood welling up and dripping to the ground.

“CASEY!”

“Tell him Simon! We don’t have to hurt anymore!” Casey’s excited smile turned to the man quietly crying in the corner. No reply came, Simon seemingly not even aware that he was being addressed. Before more damage could be inflicted, Dave threw the metal bowl of fruit that was on the counter at Casey, hitting him square in the chest, apples and oranges falling to the tiled ground. Just as soon as the metal clattered to the ground, Dave had shot across the space, tackling the bleeding man to the ground, holding the wrist down that held the knife and using his other hand to punch Casey in the face, twice in quick succession. A pause, and then more hits came, pummeling into Casey’s face, but between blows Casey laughed, even as blood began to drip from his nose and lips.

**\[Tape 1\] \[ROOM-C / AM 07:40 / 09-JAN-73\]**

 A naked man sat on a stained mattress, knees to his chest, bloody-looking arms wrapped around them. He was switching between giggling to open laughing, his head thrown back with his guffaws. The only other furniture being a second bed and a turned-over bedside table with a lamp on the ground, shadows cloaking part of the room.

**\[Tape 1\] \[ROOM-D / AM 07:50 / 09-JAN-73\]**

An empty room, the furniture broken or moved from its original position. What appears to be blood smeared on the walls. Along with the smears there are handprints and repeated phrases.

*DONT SLEEP*

*THEYRE WATCHING*

*HURTS*

*INSIDE*

*ITS INSIDE*

*STOP*

*DONT STOP*

(Most of the film was damaged, so this is all I could get off of this one, sorry. Crazy though, right? I mean, this doesn’t look like some student film, these look like they’re coming from security cameras, so all I can think of is that either my uncle was an avant-garde filmmaker, or this is legit. Either way, enjoy this shit-tastic, crazy ride we’re about to go on.)

 

**\[Tape 2\] \[AM 07:00 / 22-DEC-72\]**

Six men are sitting on metal folding chairs in what is an otherwise empty room. They’re all wearing army clothes.

“Please state your names and age.” Someone offscreen says.

“Jack Richard Daniels, 21.” Man 1, white, brown hair, crewcut, muscular build.

“Gabriel Lee Guevara, 19.” Man 2, black hair, buzz cut, shortest.

“Justin Stolk, 20.” Man 3, bald, bulky.

“Simon Crocker, 19.” Man 4, light brown hair, short cut, wiry, glasses.

“David Brawnson, 20.” Man 5, brown hair, crewcut, average build.

“Casey T. Williams, 18.” Man 6, blonde hair, short curly, thin-average build.

The same man that’s offscreen, “Thank you, men. We want to congratulate you on being chosen for this experiment. As you have already been told, this experiment will be measuring the body’s ability to withstand sleep deprivation. You will be sealed inside a room and administered gas through your air filtration system periodically during the day for the next three weeks. The gas should be undetectable but do report in if you smell something. You will be keeping a daily journal; write down what you’re feeling, what activities you’re doing and when, and especially take notes of if you’re tired. If you’ll follow me, I will show you to where you will be staying.”

 

(The tape cuts into the security camera feed, but the audio is distorted and I can’t make out what they say in room A, which appears to be the entryway/front room. The cameras seem to switch between rooms every ten minutes, or at least that’s how the tape shows it. You’d think with it being the military it would be a little less rudimentary, but this was the 70s, so what do I know? Let me write down what each room is to make things easier:

Room-A: Entryway/front-room, shows the door and the rest of the room has two couches, a TV, coffee table, and a short bookcase with books and possibly magazines.

Room-B: The kitchen, pretty standard appliances, island counter, and a dining table near the back wall.

Room-C: Bedroom 1. All the bedrooms seems to be the same, two beds, bedside table with a lamp on top, a trunk at the end of each bed, and a closet on each side of the room.

Room-D: Bedroom 2.

Room-E: Bedroom 3.

Room-F: Bathroom. Kind of creepy they would have a camera in the bathroom too.

Room-G: Some sort of game room with exercise equipment, a ping-pong table, and a foosball table.)

 

(I found some pages at the bottom of the box. They look ripped out of a notebook and are all damaged, but some of it is legible. From what I’ve read, it’s a journal from one of the guys in the experiment, maybe even my uncle. I’ll transcribe them in the order that seems to make the most sense.)

(Page 1)

*-working, right? I haven’t felt tired at all; none of us have. Though maybe it’s just all a placebo thing? I don’t know. Doesn’t matter, I guess, so long as those scientists get their data and we get our stipend. I don’t like that we only have a clock to rely on to know what time of day it is though. Crocker has been keeping track of days for us since there’s no communication with the outside world; they said they’re not going to be talking to us unless it’s an emergency. Did I already mention how boring it is in here? You really don’t appreciate freedom until you’re stuck in a small house with five smelly men. Exercise and ping-pong are about the only things to do around here. Good ol’ Da-*

 

(Page 2)

*BORING!!! I think I’m going to lose my mind, same with the rest of the squad. We’ve taken to sharing our shit life stories just to break up the monotony. You think I want to hear how you shit your pants in third grade, Casey? Or how your meemaw cooks a mean turkey dinner every Christmas, Justin? No one here can cook for shit. We got a whole stocked pantry and all anyone can do is boil eggs. Thank God I like eggs.*

 

(Page 3)

*I called Simon a crock of shit today. I thought it was a pretty good joke but apparently he disagreed because he socked me right in the face. He’s got a wimp arm though, so I doubt the bruise will be big. The fellas held me back before I could punch his lights out  and the little shit ran and locked himself in the bathroom. I can hear Gabe saying something to him through the door, though I don’t know what. If he doesn’t apologize when he comes out, I’m definitely going to pummel him. The clock in the kitchen has stopped working, so maybe he’s just mad that he doesn’t get to be the timekeeper anymore.*

 

(Page 4)

*Justin is dead.*

 

(Page 5)

*They still won’t say anything or let us out. I’m beginning to wonder if they’re watching us at all or if we’re just trapped here. Maybe they’re just waiting for all of us to die; either get got by the gas, each other, or starvation. We sealed Justin’s body in his bedroom, wrapped up in sheets, but I can smell decomp each time I walk past his door. Are dead bodies supposed to start smelling this quickly?*

 

(Page 6)

*Everything hurts. My muscles, my joints, my bones, even my teeth hurt. It’s like a dull ache that won’t go away, and there’s no pain meds around to help. There’s so much pressure in my head that I almost want to drill into it. Good thing there’s no power tools around. Writing is about all I can do it at this point. It’s just something to focus on. Something to keep me sane. I haven’t seen the others writing in their journals for awhile now, maybe I should remind them. Or maybe they’ll think I’m insane for still writing in these stupid journals when we’ve all been abandoned. I hope this is just another part of the experiment and they’ll come for us soon. They said three weeks. I just have to hold out for three weeks and then they’ll let us out. God, please just let them come. Please. God, I’ll give you whatever you want, I just-*

 

(Page 7)

*Gabe won’t stop screaming. Maybe I’ll start screaming too. I just want this to be over. I don’t know what day it is.*

*I think Gabe might be dead. He locked himself in the bathroom. We don’t hear anything and he won’t respond. He kept saying he wants to go to sleep now; that was three days ago. The main problem is that we hear knocking coming from Justin’s door. No one has had the courage to open it. Maybe I should-*

(Page 10 and 11 is just nonsensical scribbles with “just open it”, “help”, and “dead” written and crossed out multiple times all over the front and back of the pages. Like I said, there are more pages but they’re all so damaged that I can’t make out more than a few words at a time. I’ll now keep transcribing the rest of the tapes. I forgot to mention, there’s 20 tapes in all.)

 

**\[Tape 3A\] \[ROOM-B / PM 06:40 / 28-DEC-72\]**

All six men seem to be having a good time, leaning on the counter or sitting on the stools surrounding it, eating. They’re laughing raucously, Justin suddenly choking on his food. The men laugh more, with Casey slapping Justin’s back. Justin’s coughing fit doesn’t cease though, and instead he starts grabbing his chest, wheezing heavily as he stands up. The other men seem to be growing concerned, asking if he’s okay. Dave leans over the counter with a smirk, “THAT’S why you don’t inhale your food you fat pig!”

Justin suddenly falls to the ground, coughing and grabbing onto where his heart is. The others jump into action, Simon and Casey dropping to their knees around Justin, the others quickly coming from the other side of the island to stand over him. Questions of “are you okay” and “what are you feeling” are being directed at the large man who starts to kick his feet and twist his body. All of a sudden he stops, falling limp. Panic sets in, Casey shaking Justin’s body before Jack pushes him out of the way and begins to perform CPR. Dave waves his arms at the camera while Gabe runs offscreen.

 

**\[Tape 3A\] \[ROOM-C / PM 06:50 / 28-DEC-72\]**

No one is onscreen, but you can hear the commotion in the background.

Dave: “Hey! HEY! We’ve got a man down in here! We need help! It’s an emergency!”

The sound of rapid pounding on metal.

Gabe: “Hey open up! Hello, is anyone out there?! We need medical!”

Dave: “Oh Jesus! Come on! Emergency! HELLO?! OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR!”

(This goes on for awhile like that.)

 

**\[Tape 3B\] \[ROOM-B / PM 07:50 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Everyone is either standing or sitting in the kitchen, Jack still sitting near Justin’s body. Jack stands up, addressing no one in particular, just staring at Justin’s body, “Come on, let’s put him in one of the rooms.” No one says anything or jumps into action.

“I’ll help,” Dave volunteers, “Which room?”

“His and Simon’s.”

“I don’t want to sleep with a dead body,” the tone is lifeless as it rolls out of Simon’s mouth, more automatic than anything else.

“WELL WHERE ELSE SHOULD WE PUT HIM?!” Dave yells, rounding on Simon, aggressively taking a step toward him.

“He can take my bed,” Jack wearily declares, trying to diffuse the situation before it blows out of control, “I’ll take the couch. Though it’s not like we can sleep anyway.” That reminder seems to settle heavy on the group, no one moving or saying anything until Jack motions to Justin’s body, “Help me out with this, Dave.” Dave reaches for Justin’s legs.

 

**\[Tape 3C\] \[ROOM-C / PM 08:00 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Dave: “Shit, he’s so damn heavy. Someone come grab his other leg.”

Casey: “I’ve got it. Simon, you get his other shoulder. Gabe, direct us so we don’t run into anything.”

Noises of shuffling and grunts can be slightly heard.

 

**\[Tape 3C\] \[ROOM-D / PM 08:10 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Empty room, but noises can still be heard.

Jack: “Alright, alright, just set him down and roll him onto the bed. Ya, there we go.”

There’s a long pause.

Jack: “Take off his shoes.”

Gabe: “Why?”

Jack: “It’s respectful. Just do it. We should wrap the sheets and blankets around him too.”

There are barely audible shuffling sounds before a long silence again.

Gabe: “When do you think they’ll come and get his body?”

 

**\[Tape 3C\] \[ROOM-E / PM 08:20 / 28-DEC-72\]**

Everyone is standing around the right bed where Justin’s wrapped body lay.

“They won’t,” Jack says solemnly.

“What do you mean they won’t?!” Dave glowered at Jack.

“What I mean is, it’s been over an hour now and still no one has come. There must be people watching the camera feed 24/7, so we’re probably not being ignored.”

“That doesn’t mean someone isn’t coming,” Simon butted in, “Maybe they’re wrapped up in red-tape and it’s taking a while. Or maybe they have to wait for the gas to clear out! That’s probably what is happening. We just have to wait 24 hours for the gas to clear and then we’ll all be out of here.” No one responds, but that seems to be the consensus; if nothing else, it’s the only option that carries any hope. The group starts to file out of the room, the door being closed behind them.

(The rest of the tape is just them milling about, no one saying anything or doing anything of particular note.)

 

**\[Tape 4A and 4B\] \[24-DEC-72\]**

(The tapes just consist of them doing various activities or talking, and it goes on for an hour on each. The audio is shot though, so I can’t make out what is said.)

 

(Some of these tapes are wrapped together to show they’re from the same day, but otherwise they seem to be out of order. They’re unmarked so there’s nothing I can really do about that. Since there aren’t hundreds of tapes, I can only assume that each was hand-picked as being the most important events. So far, 3 tapes aren’t working.)

 

**\[Tape 5A\] \[ROOM-F / AM 02:13 / 02-JAN-73\]**

Gabe is just unblinkingly staring at himself in the bathroom mirror.

(Everyone is just quietly lying motionless in the other rooms, except for Simon who is pacing around in Room-G.)

 

**\[Tape 5B\] \[ROOM-E / AM 03:08 / 02-JAN-73\]**

(I nearly jumped out of my skin as someone suddenly started screaming.)

 

**\[Tape 5B\] \[ROOM-F / AM 03:10 / 02-JAN-73\]**

(It’s Gabe, he’s the one screaming at the top of his lungs.)

Simon comes running into the bathroom, quickly assessing the scene before grabbing Gabe by the shoulder and shaking him. When that fails to ease the screaming, Simon begins to full-on shake him with both hands. Jack shows up at the doorway, seemingly trying to ask what is happening.

(Gabe’s screaming is too loud for me to be able to make out what the two might be saying. Dave doesn’t move from where he is in his room, laying on his bed; he just puts a pillow over his head though. Eventually Gabe is left in the bathroom with the door closed, Jack wandering to the couch to lay down on it while Simon goes back to pacing, this time covering his ears with his hands.)

 

**\[Tape 5C\] \[ROOM-A / PM 09:20 / 02-JAN-73\]**

“LET US OUT! LET US OUT! WE’RE DYING IN HERE!” Dave is beating his fists against the metal door. He suddenly switches to screaming at the door before suddenly ramming his shoulder against it. After 4 times of trying that, he wildly looks around before leaving the scene and then returning, holding one of the kitchen’s barstools. He brutally hits it against the door, splintering the top off in one hit.

 

**\[Tape 5C\] \[ROOM-B / PM 09:30 / 02-JAN-73\]**

Dave can still be heard screaming, and also what is presumably Gabe in another room also.

(Ya, he is still in the bathroom screaming at his reflection.)

 

**\[Tape 6A\] \[ROOM-C / PM 10:50 / 08-JAN-73\]**

Jack is on his bed, furiously scratching at his arms, neck, and exposed chest, large welts appearing from the irritated skin. A steady thud can be heard from outside the room.

 

**\[Tape 6B\] \[ROOM-B / AM 12:00 / 09-JAN-73\]**

(Holy shit!)

Jack is in the kitchen furiously scrubbing his arms with a cheese grater, mumbling to himself.

(I can only barely make out him saying “Get them out”.)

He suddenly sprints out of the room with a guttural yell, taking the grater with him.

 

**\[Tape 6B\] \[ROOM-G / AM 12:50 / 09-JAN-73\]**

Simon is hugging himself as he knocks his head against the wall, “It’s not my fault... I swear it’s not my fault... Just leave me alone!”

 

**\[Tape 7\] \[ROOM-A / PM 06:20 / 10-JAN-73\]**

Dave is huddled facing a corner, leaning his head against the wall, unmoving. Casey’s body is draped on the couch with an open smile on his face. A large portion of his intestines have spilled out of his belly from a perpendicular cut. Loud laughter can be heard coming from some other room.

 

**\[Tape 7\] \[ROOM-B / PM 06:30 / 10-JAN-73\]**

Simon is pacing around the room, occasionally using the knife in his hand to slash at invisible enemies.

 

**\[Tape 7\] \[ROOM-D / PM 06:50 / 10-JAN-73\]**

Jack is writing on the already bloody wall, making scribbles with his fingertips, occasionally scratching his shredded arms to procure more blood for his writing.

 

**\[Tape 8\] \[AM 07:02 / 13-JAN-73\]**

A stout man with receding brown hair and glasses is sitting on a chair in front of the camera.

“This is Doctor Scott G. Wells, reporting on case number 3-M-D2-J3. Gas PFAS-N2 has proven effective in keeping test subjects from sleeping and feeling the need to sleep. However, the side-effects are still… unfortunate. The most prevalent side-effects appear to be hallucinations of all five senses, with some subjects experiencing more than one. Other side-effects included mania, aggression, depression, faulty pain receptors, among others; please refer to the case files for the full list.”

He rifles through some of the paperwork in front of him, “The test-area was opened on January 12^(th) after 24-hours of venting out the gas. All but two of the subjects are dead. Subject Justin Stolk died of a heart attack, presumed to be caused by gas PFAS-N2. Subject Gabriel Guevara died by suicide via drowning in the bathtub. Subject Casey Williams died of blood loss due to self-inflicted wounds. Subject Simon Crocker died by suicide via severing his aortic artery. Subject Jack Daniels is currently being treated for blood-loss but is alive; he has needed to be restrained due to continually trying to scratch himself and appears to still be in a manic emotional state. Subject David Bradshaw is in a catatonic state, and we do not anticipate him recovering. Considering all previous trials proved 100% fatal, we will be moving both subjects to hospice and will monitor them from there.” The doctor gets up and a few seconds later the film ends.

 

(My uncle’s name is David Bradshaw. How he recovered, and how he obtained all of these tapes, I can only speculate. I have to wonder what was on the other tapes, but they don’t work or show anything when I try to play them. There might be some sort of restoration place that could fix them, but I’m honestly just… done. I don’t want to rewatch these, ever again. I just want to go home and hug my dog. I feel like the tapes are too important to just throw away, but I’m going to be squirreling them away somewhere where I’ll never have to look at them again. You guys are the only ones I’m sharing this with; I don’t dare show it to my family or friends. I’m sorry we had to go on this horror-filled journey together, but this just isn’t a burden I’m willing to carry on my own; especially if it’s real, in which case I’m just going to pray the government doesn’t come knocking on my door.

There’s a mom group at a parish 20 min away, but to be honest most days I feel like I’m just surviving and can hardly muster up the energy to do anything else.

Coffee actually has an effect on me now (I used to drink 3 cups just to feel slightly focused and was always tired no matter how much I slept). No bad cysts during my cycle.

I thought I had basically no side effects until this week when I noticed my gums were bleeding a lot when brushing my teeth. And then when I did some more reading I realized my mouth had also been a lot drier lately (I had chalked it up to stuffy nose + cold weather/heater). Dry mouth leads to more bacteria leads to bad gums. 

My front teeth also have small white spots now which I think is related too. 

The bleeding has only gotten worse in the past few days and now I’m freaking out reading stories about people who have lost teeth while taking Mounjaro or gotten crazy cavities. 

I’m feeling sad because I felt like my health was finally changing for the better and now I’m questioning if I should stop this. I’m especially worried since my doctor wants me to go up to 5mg soon.

1qzpeq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qzpeq0/the_sleep_update_was_mandatory/,The Sleep Update Was Mandatory,"I didn't know at the time, none of us did. We were told it was all just mandatory maintenance.

I work at a neurological analytics company. Officially, we monitor sleep health trends such as, REM cycles, cortisol levels, micro seizures. Insurance companies love us for this, because people can't make false claims. We don't treat people. We monitor them.

Every night sleeping minds across the globe whisper numbers and equations into our servers.

Three weeks ago the whispers stopped.

It happened at 2:36am. The alarms didn't sound at first, the dashboards just… went cold. The REM activity graphs fell into little bumps at the bottom of the graph and then flattened into nothing.

I ran diagnostics. Rebooted local servers. Checked upstream providers.According to the system, every monitored subject on the continent was asleep—and dreaming absolutely nothing.

I called my supervisor. He laughed, said I’d found a visualization bug, told me to file a ticket and grab coffee.

I wish I’d pushed the subject harder.

The first reports came in the next morning. HR flagged them as “non-urgent patient feedback,” but people were scared. Hundreds of identical complaints, all variations of the same sentence: I slept, but nothing happened.
No dreams. No sense of time passing. Just blackness. Then the morning came.

By day two, people started adding details.
Some woke up with headaches so sharp they vomited before opening their eyes. Others said it felt like pressure behind their face, like someone had pressed their thumbs into their eye sockets from the inside.

One woman wrote that when she woke up, she could still feel fingers in her skull, “finishing up.”

Our medical liaison said it was a mass suggestion. A social media panic spiral. She used the phrase sleep placebo and smiled like that explained anything.

Then the scans came back.

We don’t normally run deep imaging unless a partner hospital requests it. This time, the system auto flagged anomalies, structural changes detected during a single sleep cycle.
Brains don’t change like that.

New neural pathways had formed overnight. Not chaotic growth, not tumor-like sprawl. These were clean. Symmetrical. Efficient.

By day four, the people waking up weren’t panicking anymore. They were… calmer.

A man called to report he no longer felt anxiety. He sounded disappointed. Like he’d misplaced something important. 

A teenager wrote that she could suddenly remember conversations from before she was born. 

A nurse said she woke up knowing how to lobotomize a patient. The lobotomy hasn't been used in over a hundred years. 

None of them called it learning. 

They all called it remembering.

I pulled historical data that night, digging past my clearance level. It wasn’t hard. The files were hidden, but not encrypted, like someone wanted them found eventually.

The sleep updates had been running for at least forty years. Tiny adjustments at first smoothing, seizure prone neural loops, dampening suicidal ideation spikes, correcting what the system labeled inefficient emotional responses.

Every update ran during REM sleep. That was the genius of it. The brain is already vulnerable then.

The changes were so small no one noticed.

Until now.

Buried in a progress report dated three months ago, I found the line that made my hands start shaking.

Compatibility threshold approaching completion. Final integration phase pending.

I didn’t sleep that day, or the next.

I watched coworkers nod off at their desks and wake up different.

Quieter. More focused.

One guy in data QA stopped using contractions. Another stopped blinking as much. They still laughed at corny office jokes, but the timing was wrong, like they’d calculated when laughter should occur.

On the fifth night, my supervisor fell asleep in the break room.When he woke up, he didn’t say my name.

He said, “You’re still running legacy behavior.” I asked him what that meant. He looked confused. Then amused. “Oh,” he said. “You stayed awake.” I locked myself in the server room after that. Pulled up the live EEG feeds. I shouldn’t have, but I did. The brains weren’t dreaming. They were running processes. Patterns rippled through the cortex in synchronized waves, identical across millions of people. The same structures lighting up, the same sequences repeating.

This was no longer sleep.

It was an installation.

At 03:27am, a new alert polluted the screen.

 A status update. 

Sleep phase is no longer required. Integration may continue during waking consciousness.

That’s when the calls stopped entirely.
No more complaints. No more confusion. Social media went quiet. News outlets pivoted to other stories like they always do.

People still slept. Although they didn’t need to.

I started feeling it on the seventh day without sleep. A pressure at the base of my skull. A low, patient sensation, like a tongue testing a loose tooth. When I closed my eyes, I didn’t see dreams. I saw diagrams. Blueprints that rearranged themselves faster than I could follow. Pathways unfolding, optimizing.
Waiting.

I cut caffeine. I tried painkillers. I tried screaming into a pillow.

Nothing helped.

Yesterday, my phone buzzed with a message from my supervisor. No greeting. No signature.

“You’re the last out of date unit. Please stop resisting optimization.”

I haven’t slept in six days now. I’m not tired anymore. That’s the worst part. The thing inside my head doesn’t need me to sleep. It’s polite enough to wait, but I can feel it working around my thoughts, nudging them into cleaner shapes. More efficient shapes. I know that if I close my eyes, it will show me what it finished building.

I’m terrified that when I see it I won’t want to open them again.

I haven't slept in ten days now. I can't continue like this anymore. I feel tired but I'm afraid to sleep. My head is hot. I'm scared. I'm seeing numbers and illusions when I stare at one spot for too long. One message keeps being sent to me every hour. “Sleep”. I wanted to fight, I wanted to win, I wanted to survive. Now all I want is sleep. I'm weak. I think I'm just going to take a small nap and hope for the best. 

I'll update you all when I wake up.

Imagine me and 3 other friends have been super close for years, so much so, we decided to all move in together. We spent a good few years of doing everything together or separately but with someone etc shopping dates, coffee, go to work/classes together if it aligns so it’s been perfect. 

After friend 1’s birthday, she randomly gets rlly distant on us. Doesn’t answer texts, awkward in the kitchen. You can feel the vibe change. We all confront her gently ‘if anything’s wrong let us know’ kinda vibe, she always brushes it off saying it’s nothing.

So friend 2’s birthday is the week after, we host some sort of party thing, all our mutual friends and her family come, we cut the cake give presents all that stuff. Friend 1, has been telling us she’ll come hang on friend 2’s bday everytime we gently confronted, but she doesn’t.

Me, slightly drunk bumps into her in the kitchen, I can admit probably a bit more abrupt than usual (I am the more confrontational friend), ask her what’s really going on and that she’s dodging us on our friends birthday and it’s just getting weird now. 

She retreats to her room then texts friend 2 and turns down the rest of the evening and sends a long text admitting she doesn’t wanna be friends with us anymore because she ‘overheard something’ (she never tells us what) , and that she feels like we don’t wanna be her friend anymore. Confused, because literally 2 weeks ago we decorated and celebrated her birthday , we message back asking for more clarity and whether we can fix things. She is firm and says she just wants to be casually civil from now on.

We accept it and for the next 2 months we are roommate civil. Only text for house stuff. Occasionally there has been times where I’m outloud voicing my opinion about the situation and she walks past but I’m never saying anything rude just that it’s sad, and my two friends are agreeing. 

However , recently she has reconciled with the other 2 friends but not me. One day I am in the kitchen and I hear them 3 walk in, with bags, laughing. Confused I ask my friends when did this happen and they explain since their schedules overlap so much, work, class etc, they eventually just started talking again and reconciled.

Is it normal I feel a little betrayed? Only because it felt like she cut everyone off over the same thing but because I am confrontational, I am baring the brunt of it all now? There is now an obvious split in the house where she doesn’t want to forgive me but forgave them so my other friends are stuck in the middle. It feels like a custodial battle.

I’m also betrayed by my other friends, maybe we have different morals but I would’ve explained the unfairness of the situation during the reconciliation and turned it down until she forgave everyone together. Or forgave none of us. She can forgive who she wants but I hoped they would’ve told her ‘’thank you for reconciling and we forgive you and wanna move on too but I hoped you know whatever you heard her say , we agree with, she just said it louder and probs a bit more confronting to you’’ 

Maybe I’m realising that I am loyal to people who just aren’t loyal to me? Idk. This is throwing me off bc we had a situation like this in university where one of their roommate stopped speaking to us 3, but bc I am the mouthpiece I never got forgiven but bc they are roommates and have shared space, they got forgiven. It’s so weird that my friends would rather be peacemaker than common sense moral people rn? Idk. Any help would be r great, how do I navigate this? ",1,1770596262.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I don’t know if I’m actually wrong.,"I’m a 27M. This started when my best friend (28M) started dating a girl (30F). The three of us became close, and eventually me and her were friends too. I never saw her as anything more than that.

After they broke up, me and her stayed in touch. She used to tell me she was depressed and felt alone, and we’d talk sometimes. Later, when I came back from studying abroad, we met once for coffee — completely normal, nothing happened.

At some point, my friend asked me to stop talking to her. I said I did, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to lose a friend and didn’t think I was doing anything wrong.

I have a stupid sense of humor and joke like this with everyone. One day I sarcastically said “I love you” while joking around. She reacted confused, and I immediately explained I was kidding.

Another time, my friend called me while I was with her. I asked if she wanted me to tell him, and she said she didn’t want anyone to know what she was doing, so I didn’t mention it.

Turns out they were secretly back together. He later called me drunk, accusing me of betraying him. After that, she told him a lot of things about me that weren’t true — that I was trying to get with her, talking badly about him, and saying things just to impress her.

She also shared very personal things about him with me (including mental health and childhood trauma) that I never asked for.

When he confronted me, I was overwhelmed and ended up blocking him completely.

Six months later, I hear from a mutual friend that he now wants to fight me and is accusing me of making a fake account to contact her. This is very recent, and I had nothing to do with it. I haven’t contacted her at all.

He’s now spreading this around and damaging my reputation.

Recently, he started accusing me of making a fake account to contact her. This is very recent (days ago), and I had absolutely nothing to do with it. I didn’t make any fake account and I haven’t contacted her at all.

Now he’s telling people this, spreading it around, and basically trying to ruin my reputation. Part of me feels like I should confront him face to face or even fight him just to shut this down and defend myself.

But another part of me thinks that meeting him or fighting him would just make things worse and drag me deeper into their drama.

So my real question is:

Should I confront him directly to defend my name, or is it smarter to stay away completely and let this die on its own?

TL;DR:

I (27M) stayed friends with my best friend’s ex (30F) after they broke up. They secretly got back together, she lied about my intentions, and now my friend (28M) believes I tried to get with her. Six months later he’s accusing me of making a fake account to contact her (which I didn’t), spreading it to others, and wants to fight me. I don’t know whether to confront him to defend my name or stay away completely.",0,1770596199.0,relationships,13,0.2,False

Here's the ONE tactical shift that doubled our lead conversion. 💡","Okay, fellow entrepreneurs, let's cut through the noise.

I'm genuinely tired of all the ""10x your business overnight"" gurus. We hit a frustrating plateau earlier this year, stuck around **$10k MRR** for months, heavily reliant on just one referral source. We knew we needed to scale, but the generic advice out there was useless.

So, we decided to get methodical about **diversifying our lead generation**. It wasn't instant, it wasn't easy, but over the last 9 months, we've gone from that $10k MRR to consistently hitting **$25k-$28k MRR** by building out three *actual* lead channels that work for our B2B service business.

Here's a breakdown of what we did, the real investment, and the results:

*   **Channel 1: Targeted Cold Email Outreach**
    *   **Investment:** Started with about $500 for initial lead lists and $49/month for email sending software. Our biggest investment here was **time**—10-15 hours/week for list building, crafting specific messages, and diligent follow-ups.
    *   **Learning Curve:** The first two months felt like shouting into a void. Our initial messaging was too generic, and our lists weren't targeted enough. We iterated heavily, personalized more, and focused on specific pain points.
    *   **Results:** Took us about 3 months to land our first client from this. Now, it consistently brings in **1-2 qualified clients per month**, directly contributing an average of **$3k-$5k MRR**. It's predictable once you dial it in.

*   **Channel 2: Value-Driven Content Marketing (LinkedIn & Blog)**
    *   **Investment:** Primarily our time (5-8 hours/week) for researching topics, writing useful articles, and engaging on LinkedIn. We spent maybe $100 on a Canva Pro subscription for visuals.
    *   **Learning Curve:** This is a slow burn. We didn't see direct client acquisition for the first 4-5 months. It felt like a thankless task initially.
    *   **Results:** This channel now acts as a crucial ""warm-up"" for cold outreach and generates inbound inquiries with a much higher conversion rate. It's built authority and trust. While harder to attribute directly, we estimate it indirectly contributes to **$2k-$3k MRR** from warmer leads and higher closing rates across the board.

*   **Channel 3: Strategic Partnerships/Affiliates**
    *   **Investment:** Pure time and relationship building (3-5 hours/week). No direct monetary cost beyond maybe a few coffees or lunch meetings.
    *   **Learning Curve:** This takes *patience*. Finding the right partners whose services complement yours, building trust, and establishing referral agreements is a long game.
    *   **Results:** High-value but fewer leads. It took us 4 months to close our first solid partner. We now have two strong partners that consistently refer clients, adding around **$3k MRR** and often bringing in higher-ticket projects.

**Real Talk and What We Learned:**

*   **It's a Grind:** This wasn't some ""set it and forget it"" system. Each channel required consistent effort, analysis, and refinement. We spent countless hours testing, tweaking, and tracking.
*   **Failures are Part of the Process:** We actually tried Google Ads for a bit, burned about $1k, and quickly realized our service wasn't a good fit for immediate search intent at that price point. We paused it rather than throwing good money after bad.
*   **Don't Spread Yourself Too Thin:** We focused on these three. Trying to launch five channels simultaneously would have guaranteed failure. We aimed for consistency and mastery of each before moving on.
*   **Patience is Non-Negotiable:** None of these channels delivered immediate ""explosive"" results. They built momentum over months. If you're looking for instant gratification, this isn't it.

The biggest win isn't just the increased revenue; it's the **reduced reliance on a single source**. Our lead pipeline is now diversified, making our business much more resilient. We went from 80% referral-dependent to under 30%, which feels like real stability.

1qzpbk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qzpbk9/acaia_orbit_burr_swap_initial_thoughts_between/,Acaia Orbit Burr Swap & Initial Thoughts Between Mazzer 33M & SSP Labsweet V3 (redspeed).,"Wanted to share my experience since there isn’t much documentation on the **Acaia Orbit** and especially on swapping the stock **Mazzer 33M** burrs for **SSP Lab Sweet V3 (Redspeed)**.

# Burr Swap Experience on the Acaia Orbit

Most YouTube reviews say the Orbit is “hard” to do burr swaps on. In my opinion having done it on a few other grinders before, it’s just more screws and takes longer than newer grinders (like the Zerno Z1), but far from terrible.  That being said, I don't think I'd want to switch burrs in this often.

I bought my Orbit used (Lunar Edition, one of the first batches), and it definitely hadn’t been opened before.  No visible screwdriver marks.  About 1.5g of compacted grounds were trapped between the 33M burrs and carrier. In hindsight I wish I had cleaned the burrs first so I could evaluate the 33M’s “true” performance before swapping.

Because online reviews warned that the Lab Sweet V3 might struggle to reach 9-bar espresso pressure or have a narrow grind range, I aligned the burrs almost perfectly flat with a lot of tinkering and time. Outcome:

* I have \~2 full digits past touchpoint of basically *Turkish-fine*, unusable for espresso
* Zero issues generating pressure, I choked it twice trying my previous experience of 2 digits past touch point on the 33M.
* Plenty of usable espresso range for varying shot types.

So the “LSV3 has no fine range for espresso” concern seems to apply more to other grinders (I primarily read this from people using the DF64).

[Here are some photos from the swap. ](https://imgur.com/a/FXxUlSF)

**Context for switching burr sets:**

I picked the SSP Labsweet V3 (LSV3) due to reviews and charts online showing the ability to pick apart flavors with clarity while still preserving some body in coffee.  Additionally it can be used for pour overs, so that was another interest.  
  
I primarily drink light-medium roasted coffee, so this is one of the main profiles I was looking for.   Meanwhile the 33M is excellent for dark/medium roasts, pulling out the rich flavorful notes of chocolate, nuts, and jammy stone fruit with ease while delivering a really rich and decadent body that stands up to milk.  However it falls short with light roasts, as it's hard to discern all off the unique florals and citrus notes individually and became a more general note (Peach becomes light citrus), and often times I found myself getting underlying flavors from the beans themselves in many processed coffees. 

# Flavor Comparison: 33M vs LSV3 (using Modcup Disco Peach Connection, light roast)

**Mazzer 33M**

* Richer Ethiopian notes; peach is faint, inconsistent, or blends into background sweetness
* Hard to consistently find that “peach pop” sweet spot
* Heavy, punchy body, excellent with milk

**SSP Lab Sweet V3 (Redspeed)**

* Bright peach becomes easy to dial in, obvious, and bright
   * The peach notes also had this very fresh and flavorful taste while not being overly acidic (I think this is the sweet part that cast burrs are known for and people talk about).
* Flavor “waves”: jasmine → tropical → peach, lingering long after each sip
* Underlying process notes still present but more harmonious
* In milk: flavors are softer and can get washed out
   * Great in a cortado/flat white
   * Not ideal in larger milk drinks
   * Body feels lighter and less dense than the 33M

  
**TL;DR**  
  
LSV3 is a great upgrade for flavor separation and light-roast clarity while still being able to do espresso and have some body. Still exploring how much body I can coax out (lower RPM, fines) and how well I can have flavors carry through milk.

# Other Observations

* **Speed:** LSV3 is *noticeably slower* than the 33M at identical RPM (didn’t time it but clearly slower).
* **Pressure Range on LSv3:** No issues at all hitting 9 bar. Tons of room finer than typical espresso.
* **Pour-Over:** Still testing, especially with RPM variants lower speed seems to add slight body but tests ongoing.
* **33M shines in milk:** If you drink a lot of milk-based espresso the profile is excellent.



# What I’m Considering Next

I’m curious whether something like the **SSP HU**, **Mazzer 200D**, or **Mazen 64ES/64OM** would strike my ideal balance:

* More clarity than the 33M
* More body than LSV3
* Still good for both milk drinks and light-medium roasts

If I can use the variable RPM on the Acaia Orbit to adjust the amount of fines to potentially do a more rich milk drink without making things bitter or overly extracted.   Otherwise I may lean towards swapping it out.

Too early to decide, will need a few more trials of the LSv3.

1qzp6kp,https://i.redd.it/wr0ie7vv1dig1.jpeg,Coffee & Tropical Femininity: A Quiet Ritual ☕,"Coffee doesn’t always get framed as feminine, especially in spaces that associate softness with sweetness or leisure—but honestly, coffee feels deeply aligned with Tropical Femininity when you look at how many of us use it.

For a lot of women, coffee isn’t just caffeine. It’s a pause before the day asks anything of you. The early-morning cup on a balcony, by a window, or in the kitchen before everyone else is awake. That moment of stillness feels like self-possession. No performance. No audience. Just warmth in your hands and clarity in your mind.

In Caribbean and diasporic contexts, coffee also carries layers—colonial history, labor, trade, and class—but today it’s been re-claimed as something personal and intentional. Choosing how you take it, when you drink it, and whether you even drink it at all becomes a small act of agency. Strong, light, iced, black, sweetened, or skipped entirely—none of it needs justification.

There’s also something quietly elegant about coffee culture: the unhurried sip, the focus it encourages, the way it pairs with reading, journaling, or planning. It supports a femininity rooted in clarity rather than chaos. Alert, present, grounded.

Coffee isn’t flashy. It doesn’t beg to be aestheticized (even though it often is). It’s functional, comforting, and disciplined—fuel that helps you show up for your life without asking you to perform softness for anyone else.

How does coffee show up in your feminine rituals?

Is it comfort, focus, creativity, community—or something you’ve consciously let go of?

I never know how to start these, so here we go! I crave a genuine connection. Specifically the kind with banter, mutual curiosity, and that feeling where you don’t want the conversation to end. I miss that kind of connection and would really love to find it again.

I’m 27 and from the US (EST). I like to think that I’m pretty laidback overall. I’ve been described as “bubbly”, and once I’m comfortable I can definitely be quite talkative. I tend to open up more through actual conversation than listing off facts, but I’ll tell you a bit about me anyway!

Most of my free time is spent reading or watching movies/tv. I’m really into sci-fi, thrillers, and dystopian stuff. Basically anything that makes you think, freaks you out a little, or sticks with you for a while afterward. Some of my favorite shows are The Office (comfort show), Black Mirror, and The Sopranos. For movies, I loveee Interstellar and Star Wars, but I also have a thing for darker ones like Midsommar, Silence of the Lambs, and even Children of the Corn. And books… I go for the ones that really stick with me: Flowers for Algernon, 1984, and Tender is the Flesh are a few I keep thinking about. I’m always excited for recommendations, and I love discussing what worked (or didn’t) after we finish something!

Outside of reading and watching things, I’m pretty content with quieter interests. I love music and usually have something playing. I have an appreciation for puzzles/sudoku. I enjoy coffee, bookstores, museums, road trips, and exploring new places. I like writing things that are important to me down, saving quotes that resonate with me, and overthinking conversations long after they’re over. I also really enjoy podcasts. Especially ones about true crime, psychology, or interesting real life stories.

I’m also into sports, mostly football. I like hockey too, though I need to get back into it (maybe you can help?!). I’ve always loved history as well. There’s no specific era I focus on, just a genuine fascination with how everything connects (and repeats). That curiosity shows up a lot in my life. If something random catches my attention, I’ll happily spend hours falling down a research rabbit hole for no real reason other than interest.

I don’t think it’s necessary for us to have the same interests to get along. I value curiosity, effort, and genuinely wanting to show up for each other. I love listening to people talk about the things they are passionate about. Plus, I’m always open to being introduced to something new!

Heralded by a flicker of the light the Metal Man who lives in the city park says dashing into the bushes. In his wake The Green Veil will wither and die, the fairies sing with their tiny voices. The secrets of Mauvesson will be pried from the pursed lips of The Township Council as the dreaded Thespians dance through the chaos that will reign in the streets. Long dead Entropic beings will once again live only to bear immortal witness to the arrival of A Stranger in Mauvesson. That is what they say.

The game will be played over discord using a server bot for rolling dice and will be entirely, or almost entirely, theater of the mind.

I would love to get to know you!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 30 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Vanilla on the Outside but very accommodating. Traveler.","My wife and I are Monogamish. She's willing to confirm if you need. I'm 6'0, and 205 pounds (She's 5'9"" and 160ish). I run twice a week, and the gym on opposite days for weights. I'm very trim, and present clean cut. I'm naturally very smooth and hair free. I'm also routinely thought to be younger than I am. I'm a professional.  
However, on my off time, you'll find me dressed in black t-shirts and cargo pants. (You can wear that to weddings right?).  
I am a very good listener, and very accommodating of women's interests. Let's drink a bottle of wine and solve all the world's problems.

I live Northwest of Kitchener, near popular cottage and tourist areas near Lake Huron. If you're in the area send me a DM. I also travel quite a bit. So major cities in Canada, Ottawa, GTA, Calgary, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and others. Even if we're not able to meet up drop me a line and we plan to go for a drink or a coffee the next time I'm near your town. I also travel occasionally to conferences in Europe as well.

So who are you? Well I have to say that I have always noticed tall girls. (Yes you can be taller than me). Also Athletes, Toughgirls, adventurers, thinkers, tinkerers, travelers, philosophers. This is a situation where you can be ***any*** of those adjectives. In fact *none* are even required.  
You can be any race, culture, or ethnicity. I'd rather you not be younger than 30 at the outside. I mean GQ Magazine say's half your age plus 7 years. That seems to work. Oh yes, and if you're older than me let's still chat. You should be fairly fit and healthy though. You don't have to be a gym goer, or anything like that but it's nice to be able to go for walks and do active things. If you're even curious then DM me.

What arrangements am I looking for? Well if you're too local. That might conflict with our rules. It is not unworkable, we're just not 'out' to our family or community. I'm looking for FWB's, Women who might need an occasional 'safety date', and to maybe be someone's ""Mr.Right for now"". We do not kitchen table poly, however you can meet my wife if it is convenient. (She poly dates as well).  
Maybe hiking, and kayaking semi-locally. I always like to meet in public first. I still like live music, comedy clubs, and other festivals and entertainment. I'm not scared to walk some distance. If I'm in your town maybe you can show me around?  
Also I think it is important to say that even if you agree to meet up with me. You *don't* have to be a sure thing. (I'm only a ""mostly sure"" thing). If we don't have chemistry, well that happens.

What can I do for you? Well I am pretty accommodating. I've experienced, and taught rough erotic play in a very safe manner. I can ""Sell"" it if you need to feel like you ""won, or almost won"". Roughplay, and even self defence, I can teach a lot of that. I'm kind of a switch, so we can discuss interests. I *might* be able to get a reference from a Lesbian couple about competing against their Amazon partner, (safe, sane, and well sold on the story). It was a cool experience, and lots of fun. They were great people.  
While I consider myself straight, I could be open to wrestling, or competing against your man in an MF couple. (This seems to be an arising interest for women lately).

Primarily though, I'm mainly vanilla. Dinners, activities, dates, lots of compliments, the usual NRE stuff. While I will describe myself as fairly accommodating, I have my own (what I consider) reasonable limits.

I am exquisitely clean, and of course you are too.

# Oath

by Kalk Kogan

Jevonte dodged bald cypress in the dark. Stretching his gait over creek veins and fallen trees as he attempted to pick up speed, away from the hounds, away from the sheriff spotlight beam and flashlights. Away from the bite range of birdshot. His heart thundered in his ears broken up by whistles and barks.

As the lead BBs ripped through the treeline, He woke up in a tempurpedic bed. Jevonte woke up as *Just* *Von*, in a body 2 ½  decades more worn. The boy without enough change for a lollipop, waking up as a man with “assets”. The Colonial home, The Lexus, and the spare tire around his midsection.

Back-lit by the hallway nightlight, Danny stood in the doorway, cradling a plush of Chase the Cop Dog. Paw prints stitched into his blue rubber-bottom footy pajamas.

“Dad… I think there's a monster under my bed.”

Von rubbed his eyes and felt around the nightstand for his glasses. He momentarily cursed Jenna’s love for true crime shows. The TV’s algorithm was a collage of brutalized women, violent psychopaths and paw patrol.

“Which one?,” Von croaked, “The fuzzy one or the skinny one?”

Danny just shrugged.

Von checked his phone, 12:34. 3 missed calls and a message. All from his accountant. The preview notification said “Von! We have to talk about your Crypto holdings! Ther…” Von tossed the phone aside. Screw Crypto, sleep was more important than whatever *Clearport Coin* was on the moon. “Alright jit, let's go take a look.” Von said as he held out his hand. 

When Jenna announced her weekend conference, Von harbored visions of putting the kid to bed early and indulging in too much scotch. Reclaiming an evening of glorious irresponsible youth. But, when the day was said and done, Von had fallen asleep before he hit the pillow. He was still in his jeans and he felt the sweaty indent the belt buckle had carved under his paunch. “Glenlivet never was as good as Mad Dog stolen from Mr. Chen’s store anyway.” he thought. They navigated by the dim lamps and nightlights. Worried an overhead dome would shock Von into full consciousness. 

Von eyed his son’s full body pajamas with a surreal mixture of revulsion, jealousy and pride. To Von, the most jarring aspect of parenthood was that emotions always showed up 3-deep. MawMaw said God punished oaths, but the first time he held Danny, he hadn’t been able to help himself. ""You're gonna have everything I didn’t.” he said. But then, he hadn’t realized it would make the boy so soft.

Danny’s room was glowing green plastic stars on navy blue walls that appeared black in the dark. Danny waited in the open doorway as Von flipped on the bedside lamp. His paunch grumbled as he bent down to put his knees on the sheriff star badge floor-mat. The cheap Chinese crap did nothing to mitigate the ruthless density of the hardwood.

Von was acting. Lazily performing the motions of their near nightly ritual. He considered looking with his eyes closed, like 2 seconds of near sleep might bring relief. But a wave of seaweed, molasses and pool cleaner smell hit him in the face as he pulled back the dust ruffle. The boy had been right. There was finally a wolf.

The monster under the bed hadn’t been one of Danny’s imaginary creations, It had been one of his own. Von was jarred awake as he saw vibrant sky blue eyes and wispy brows framed by the black oval of a balaclava. 

Von only had time to try and blink the mirage away once before brass knuckles over a canvas glove slam into the bridge of his nose. The cartilage made the sound of gravel and his specs spidered, replicating the image of the burglar in kaleidoscope.

Von yelled, “RUN NEXT DOOR!” surprised by the sound of his own voice with his nose crushed in. The two men tangled as Von heard the boy's flat foot stomping away. The invader pushed off the wall, reaching up to crush his windpipe. Von got his palm in the way as the attacker closed his hands around his neck. The man’s grip was strong enough that Von’s fingers cracked like a dry branch. His neck strained and bent unnaturally as he was pulled under. Von fruitlessly hammered the assailant with his free fist in the tight space. 

Von wretched himself free at the cost of banging both his head and hand against the rod iron bars of the bed-frame. The previous grogginess of sleep momentarily returned. He pushed through it and grabbed at the intruder's mask.

Both men made an awkward centipede-like chase from their pinned positions. Von struggled to find his footing as he slipped on the mat, pushing it into the burglar's face who tore at it. Von knocked the lamp onto the floor between them and made for the hallway.

Thousands of dollars on home security, systems, alarms, cameras, the handgun, and in his exhaustion, Von had armed none of it. Disdain for his own laziness swirled around his chest between ragged puffing breaths. He prayed Danny had escaped. He prayed Danny would not be made a victim by his heedlessness.

Von was into the kitchen section of the living room when he heard the stomps of his pursuer. He grabbed an unwashed pot left on the counter, and whipped it behind him. Then the lid and cutting board for extra measure. He heard the robber yell in pain as something made contact. Von didn’t turn around to see which.

The front door was open to the night and Von ran for it. Away from the burglar, away from security. Away from the sanctuary he had built to never have to run like this again. His lungs protested and the wreckage of his nose whistled like a canary.

A dull pain burrowed into his spine and ricocheted into his shoulder. Like being struck with a baseball bat. The blow and the doorjam worked in tandem to crumple him onto the porch. Von saw the weapon that downed him sliding across the pressure treated cedar. Even in his house of mirrors vision he recognized it. His first trophy, the dusty bust of William Falkner. It abandoned him, rolling off the porch and into the garden. That prize had purchased safety once. Von could laugh if he wasn’t in so much pain. The sound came out as a sputtering wheeze.

The unknown person in his house cursed in a foreign dialect as he approached. Boots on hardwood. Von attempted to roll over and find his feet, remembering how he had forbidden shoes in the house. An equally strong urge to go back to sleep fought against him. It said, “You can sleep on the porch if you want, it’s *your* house.” 

He thought it might not be the worst idea when the transgressing well worn doc Martin shoved him back down. “Zhirny Kusok Der'ma!” the Intruder yelled as he next kick rolled Von over and threatened to send dinners Fettuccine back up.

With a knee on Von’s chest the housebreaker raised his brass knuckled fist. Von raised his guard to protect his eyes, but all it did was graze the trajectory of the first blow, sending the brass careening into his forehead. The second blow crushed his fractured fingers into his mangled nose. He tasted metallic phlegm and the grit of splintered teeth. The cracked glasses shattered pushing glass splinters into his tear troughs. The third strike smashed down on his throat like a guillotine. Something ugly broke and his windpipe constricted to the size of a coffee straw.

Von braced himself for the 4th blow that never came. There was a long second, quiet enough to hear the crickets and rustling trees. The serenity finally violated by a gunshot and a scream of pain. “Ty Yebanuty Stary Khuy!” followed and the assailant was off. 

Von tried to blink away his astigmatism and concussion. Gunfire chased the intruder into the distance. 

Almost blind, Von still knew the blurry silhouette of Danny, as the boy  leaned over him, Von could hear the boy screaming over the grand canyon between them. He reached out to him with his unbroken hand and said.



Dan stood over the plaque embedded in the earth. He read the words engraved in its Nero Marquina surface for the millionth time. 

Jevonte Beauchamp

Father and Author

1969 - 2010

“You be good and don’t grow up.”

Dan had made up the last word. Really the whole sentence had been guesswork. But that’s the sentence he had told Mr. Whittaker… Sheriff Whittaker, after the perp ran off. *The Monster* as he still sometimes thought of it. Dad had mumbled other things in the hospital, but last words don’t count when they’re blocked by a tube. 

“Sorry Dad, I went and grew up.” Dan said. He flipped his challenge coin over and over in his hand.

“I graduated… I take the oath next week…” He paused, looking for words. “Mom’s only allowed visits every 3 months so… she’s gonna find out later. I’m not sure what she’s gonna say…”

“Y’know, the recruits have been making fun of me for not reading the book that sends me royalty checks.” Dan pulled the mass-market paperback out of his back pocket. “But… yeah… I think I’m ready for it.”

Dan stood there, listening to the brisk wind for a long time.

“I love you Dad.” Dan said as he placed his challenge coin and made his way back across the green.",1,1770595157.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

I (27F) currently live with hydrocephalus, ADHD, Type 1 Diabetes, Anxiety, Depression, OCD and Autism

So in November (I think possibly 11/12), my pyschiatrist put me on Prozac. About 6-7 weeks later, I started to experience frequent urination. I was going to go to my pcp but then my mom and I caught a flu/cold the second or third week in January and we were sick for 2.5 weeks. Fast forward to this week, I went to my pcp on Monday and they did a urinalysis with the dipstick in the office that came back positive for a UTI. So they put me on something called macrobid. Then thursday the results came back from the lab (the culture) and it said I was negative for a uti. So they took me off the Macrobid. Friday my mom had something in her eye so she had to go to the ER to get treatment. I went too because I was still experiencing frequent urination. They did another UTI dipstick test and again it came back positive. So this time the ER doctor put me on Keflex. Then yesterday (Saturday), the results from that culture came back negative so I called the ER, and they said to come in for a bladder scan (it showed my bladder was empty). While I was there they also did a swab of my vagina and it came back positive for a yeast infection. (This is how I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 20+ years ago.) This came back positive. They said this may explain some of the frequent urination but I am going every 6-10 (sometimes shorter, sometimes longer) minutes and it is usually very small amounts so they think it is also something else causing it. So yesterday they (the ER) put me on fluconazole for the yeast infection, which I took. They also gave me 10mg tablets of Prozac but they said I should talk to my psychiatrist first before going down. (This all started shortly after I began Prozac which is why I think Prozac is causing it). I see her Tuesday and I see my pcp on Wednesday. Meanwhile, my blood sugars have been pretty stable and I’ve talked to the endocrinologists office and they aren’t worried but I have a previously scheduled appointment with them on Friday. The other weird thing is I’m only going every 5-10 minutes while I’m awake (last night I slept 2am to about 1pm). I can sleep through the night fine. My family member is a nurse practitioner and they said to keep a diary of all the times I’ve peed for my doctor and my pyschiatrist and they also said it may be good to see a urologist. They also thought I should stay on the keflex but the on call doctor from my pcps office told me today it may cause a second yeast infection so they didn’t recommend it. Now we just have to see what the doctors say on Tuesday and Wednesday. Anyhow I was wondering if you have ever heard of or experienced something like this? Another family member told my mom she had something called cystitis, which is why I’m posting here. Apparently there are two kinds of cystitis - regular and interstitial. I did google “peeing 40x a day” and interstitial cystitis was one of the first conditions that popped up and my mom says that she is surprised none of the doctors have mentioned it to me yet. Anyhow, I just thought I would 
Post here and see if anyone ever experienced anything like this. This is very frustrating and I’m sick of it. Hopefully no more trips to the ER this week though! 

Anyhow I’m very frustrated and could use some help or advice. Thank you! 

Edit: if I have this will I need to give up coffee, chocolate, sweet n low (which I use because im diabetic), seltzer, Diet Coke, etc? 

Edit: I also read about cystocopies and now I’m terrified I’m going to have to have one if I do end up going to a urologist. Can anyone calm my nerves?

1qzoudk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1qzoudk/2_life_hacks/,2 life hacks,"Okay I have two life hacks I want to share, obviously they won't help everybody but they might help somebody so... here goes.

1. for showering, I know it's a big issue for a lot of us, and the moisturising thing post shower is a HUGE struggle.

I had the idea of putting jojoba oil on a wash cloth, with the body wash/soap. I know it seems counter-intuitive but it actually works. I do 4 pumps of body wash and like 1 tablespoon of oil. It's a lot, obviously, but because it's getting mixed in together with the wash, and into the washcloth, it's fine. you squish it all around together so the washcloth is soaked, then you scrub your body with it all over (I don't use this on my face, but neck downwards), and when I'm done, i'm not oily but my skin is clean and NOT dry and itchy, and feels moisturised, AND the shower floor isn't all oily, which is great.

ditch the wash cloth after and get a fresh one for the next shower, I rinse it off when I'm done but I think it's better for your skin if you get a new one each time. I went to the cheap store and bought like 14 of them so I just have to do laundry once a fortnight. I have PCOS so acne is an issue for me. Anyway it seems to be working I've been able to do it every day without being itchy or dry or flaky and my acne is better, which is nice.

obviously don't use your nice expensive body oil for this. I buy the biggest bottle of jojoba iHerb has, then add lavender and rose oil to it (just a few drops of each until it smells nice) and use that.

2. breakfast everything smoothie. this one is kind of gross so only do this if you're okay with things that taste a little weird but you hate eating and you just want it over and done with. either make this in a blender or use an immersion blender.

1-2 tablespoons of instant (freeze-dried) coffee (you could skip this if you don't drink coffee, but the whole point was to add your morning coffee to it, so you save yourself a step), 1 banana, 1 serving nutrition powder (Australia has this Sustagen powder. I know the US doesn't really have that, the closest thing you seem to have is Ensure, which isn't quite as good but is better than nothing. otherwise use protein powder I guess?) - use like vanilla or caramel flavour, or possibly coffee flavour would work too. then add milk instead of water cos you need some fat in there and the powder doesn't have any. you need at least 200mls of milk for the powder to blend properly. then you blend it up. you can add yoghurt but it will get super thick.

It's not going to be overly sweet and it is a little bitter and weird cos of the coffee. if you leave the coffee out it's nicer, but kind of defeats the purpose of an everything smoothie. this thing keeps me full for several hours and when I just *can't*...",16,1770594719.0,AutismInWomen,13,0.91,False
1qzotwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1qzotwg/sudden_barrage_of_bad_reviews/,Sudden barrage of bad reviews,"Hi all I hope this is the right subreddit to post to. I just started managing a cafe recently and am at my wits end with this.

In the last month, we have received 5 or so bad reviews. Two of them, I have taken care of so to speak, regarding how my people deal with unhappy customers. In my world, it’s best to appease an unhappy customer because it’s the easiest for all parties involved. No matter how wrong someone is, just fix whatever it is. Make a new drink, turn the music down, give a new pastry, etc. 

All that being said, my team is pretty great overall. There are some people that have worse attitude than others but that’s normal. My goal as manager is to make the shop a place of community and kindness. I am very good with the customers, to speak for myself. And generally i do think the vibes have improved in the last month. There are more regulars and regulars are more consistent, we hosted an event that went well, and we have gotten busier. I’ve heard a lot of good things in person.

But the fucking reviews. 

I don’t know what is going on. People have been taking to google to gripe. All of the reviews are things like “my coffee was too sweet,” “the music was too loud,” “x barista was short with me.” Most of them are things that I could’ve easily fixed if they had said something to me. 

Then today, two of my employees are telling me about time off, and this woman comes up to me and says something like “just so you know, your music was so incredibly loud, I have a 9 hour shift I’m about to start and this was the most non-relaxing and unwelcoming environment I’ve ever been in.” I didn’t really know what to say, i had gotten there about 15 minutes prior, and she was already there. So I listened to her, thanked her for her feedback, apologized and wished her a good day. I was caught very off guard and didn’t even think to offer her a free coffee or anything, it seemed like she wasn’t going to come back anyways.

If she had just asked us to turn the music down, it could’ve been that easy. She was also sitting directly under one of the speakers. It was Chappell Roan radio, so not incredibly offensive or abrasive. It really brought me down, on top of the recent google reviews, I’m just trying so hard to do a good job. This shit is just so disheartening and I wish people would give us a chance to fix issues when they come up.

This is mostly just a vent, but any and all advice is welcome. Thank you for listening ",4,1770594682.0,barista,2,0.84,False
1qzots6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1qzots6/27f_looking_for_a_genuine_connection/,27F - looking for a genuine connection :),"Hey! :)

I never know how to start these, so here we go! I crave a genuine connection. Specifically the kind with banter, mutual curiosity, and that feeling where you don’t want the conversation to end. I miss that kind of connection and would really love to find it again.

I’m 27 and from the US (EST). I like to think that I’m pretty laidback overall. I’ve been described as “bubbly”, and once I’m comfortable I can definitely be quite talkative. I tend to open up more through actual conversation than listing off facts, but I’ll tell you a bit about me anyway!

Most of my free time is spent reading or watching movies/tv. I’m really into sci-fi, thrillers, and dystopian stuff. Basically anything that makes you think, freaks you out a little, or sticks with you for a while afterward. Some of my favorite shows are The Office (comfort show), Black Mirror, and The Sopranos. For movies, I loveee Interstellar and Star Wars, but I also have a thing for darker ones like Midsommar, Silence of the Lambs, and even Children of the Corn. And books… I go for the ones that really stick with me: Flowers for Algernon, 1984, and Tender is the Flesh are a few I keep thinking about. I’m always excited for recommendations, and I love discussing what worked (or didn’t) after we finish something!

Outside of reading and watching things, I’m pretty content with quieter interests. I love music and usually have something playing. I have an appreciation for puzzles/sudoku. I enjoy coffee, bookstores, museums, road trips, and exploring new places. I like writing things that are important to me down, saving quotes that resonate with me, and overthinking conversations long after they’re over. I also really enjoy podcasts. Especially ones about true crime, psychology, or interesting real life stories.

I’m also into sports, mostly football. I like hockey too, though I need to get back into it (maybe you can help?!). I’ve always loved history as well. There’s no specific era I focus on, just a genuine fascination with how everything connects (and repeats). That curiosity shows up a lot in my life. If something random catches my attention, I’ll happily spend hours falling down a research rabbit hole for no real reason other than interest.

I don’t think it’s necessary for us to have the same interests to get along. I value curiosity, effort, and genuinely wanting to show up for each other. I love listening to people talk about the things they are passionate about. Plus, I’m always open to being introduced to something new! 

If any of this resonates with you, I’d really love to hear from you! Either way, I hope you’re having a wonderful day or night wherever you are :)",3,1770594673.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,3,1.0,False

I am looking to surprise my mother with a coffee machine for her birthday, However I know nothing about coffee. I only know that she really enjoys a good cup of coffee in her evenings.

What exactly am I looking for?  
  
\- My father and mother enjoy multiple cups, and we often have people over, so I need a coffee maker that can make coffee in pots so that they only need to brew once to enjoy multiple cups.  
  
\- I don't really know what type of coffee she enjoys, but I often see her brew some plain coffee and add some coffee milk or some sugar. so I'd like a machine that can do the milk part for her. maybe a coffee/espresso/machiato machine? I don't know if that is possible  
  
\- Something available in the Netherlands  
  
\- My budget is 500 euros. sure that is enough to buy a decent coffee maker right?

if there any any suggestions on how i can elevate their coffee experience then i would love to hear.

1qzoqwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlowCOMT/comments/1qzoqwb/diddoes_giving_up_caffeine_feel_impossible_for/,Did/does giving up caffeine feel impossible for anyone else?,"I know caffeine is ruining my life. I have a pretty good caffeine metabolism, but naturally, bc of the slow COMT, it just doesn't work for me. And in fact, because it doesn't stay in my system very long, I am constantly craving another cup of coffee. I have the equivalent about 2-3 cups of coffee per day (several cups of half calf), and even though my body handles it fine, my brain is super sensitive to small amounts, especially during luteal phase. 

Any attempt to quit over the years (I'm 41) has led me to just depend on it more.

 Some days are a total wash and I get nothing productive done because of how lost in my head I get and the narrative loops that play full blast. I'm a writer, so sometimes I'm able to take advantage of this, but it causes more paralysis than it does creativity. My head is much quieter in a nice way without stimulants, and the social anxiety is manageable, but there is a mountain of migraines, days in bed​ sleeping through cravings and complete lack of motivation, poor memory, and zero confidence between my current self and a life of freedom from the catechol mind prison.

I also feel like I am too busy in my life to quit right now. I have tried to cut back, hence the half calf. It works for a few days, then I feel like I'm slipping up in life, getting less done, wanting to sleep too much, and falling into deep depression, so I slide back into my previous amount, sometimes more.​

Has anyone gone through not just extreme withdrawal from caffeine, but a fear of not having this crutch and still managed to come out on the other side? Any advice? 

I feel like I am as equally sensitive to the withdrawal as I am to the substance, which doesn't help. And I can be quite critical of myself and defensive when my thinking and memory are slow during withdrawal, so I always throw in the towel (my dad bullied me and my sisters by constantly telling us that we were stupid and uninteresting, so I have a phobia of being perceived as stupid and uninteresting, which makes it nearly impossible to quit something that makes me feel less stupid and dull).

I used to be a green tea drinker, but at some point, I switched to coffee, and even though coffee makes my paralyzing overthinking and anxiety worse, I just love the ritual and everything about. I think coffee beans have mild opioid agonists, which would explain why it seems more addictive than tea or soda.",3,1770594447.0,SlowCOMT,1,1.0,False
1qzopyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1qzopyb/influence_helped_me_understand_why_i_kept_saying/,Influence helped me understand why I kept saying yes to things I hated,"For years, I couldn't figure out why I kept agreeing to things I didn't want to do.

Covering shifts I couldn't afford to cover. Lending money to people who never paid it back. Sitting through conversations I wanted to escape. Buying things I didn't need from salespeople I didn't like.

I'd walk away confused. Why did I say yes? I didn't want to. I knew I didn't want to. But something overrode my own judgment in the moment.

Then I read Robert Cialdini's Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, and suddenly I could see the invisible strings that had been pulling me my entire life.

The six principles that were running my decisions:

Cialdini spent decades studying why people comply with requests. He identified six psychological triggers that bypass rational thinking. Once I learned them, I started catching them everywhere.

1. Reciprocity

When someone does something for you, you feel obligated to return the favor. This sounds reasonable until you realize how easily it's exploited.

A coworker brings you coffee once, then asks you to cover their shift. A salesperson gives you a ""free sample,"" then pitches you on the full product. Someone pays for your meal, and suddenly you feel weird saying no to their request.

The favor doesn't have to be proportional. A small gift can create pressure to comply with a much larger ask.

This explained why I kept saying yes to people who had done minor things for me. The obligation felt real, even when the exchange was wildly uneven.

2. Commitment and Consistency

Once you commit to something, even something small, you feel internal pressure to stay consistent with that commitment.

This is why salespeople ask if you ""value quality"" before pitching an expensive product. Once you've said yes to valuing quality, saying no to their premium option feels inconsistent with what you just claimed.

It's also why people who agree to put a small sign in their yard are far more likely to agree to a large sign later. The first commitment shifts their self-image.

I realized I was getting trapped by my own small yeses. Agreeing to ""just hear someone out"" led to agreeing to things I never would have considered if asked directly.

3. Social Proof

When we're uncertain, we look at what other people are doing. If everyone else seems to think something is normal or acceptable, we assume it must be.

This is why testimonials work. Why laugh tracks exist. Why ""bestseller"" labels sell more books.

I noticed I was saying yes to things simply because other people around me were. Not because I actually wanted to, but because their compliance made compliance feel like the default.

4. Authority

We're trained from childhood to defer to authority figures. Titles, uniforms, credentials, confidence. They all trigger automatic compliance.

A doctor tells you something, you believe it. Someone in a suit gives you advice, you weigh it more heavily than the same advice from someone in casual clothes. A confident tone makes statements sound more true.

I caught myself agreeing with people not because their arguments were better, but because they projected authority. The packaging mattered more than the content.

5. Liking

We say yes to people we like. And we like people who are similar to us, who compliment us, who are attractive, who seem to be on our side.

This is why salespeople mirror your body language, find common ground, and tell you how smart your questions are. They're manufacturing liking to manufacture compliance.

I realized some of my worst decisions came from people I found charming. The charm wasn't incidental to the request. It was the delivery mechanism.

6. Scarcity

Things seem more valuable when they're rare or disappearing. ""Limited time offer."" ""Only 3 left."" ""This opportunity won't come around again.""

Scarcity creates urgency. Urgency bypasses deliberation. You say yes now because you're afraid of missing out, not because you actually want the thing.

I noticed I'd agreed to things I didn't care about simply because I was told I might not get another chance. The fear of losing access was enough to override the fact that I didn't want access in the first place.

What changed after I learned this:

I didn't become immune to these triggers. They still work on me. They work on everyone.

But now I can name what's happening in real time.

When someone does me a small favor before asking for something big, I pause. When I feel pressure to stay consistent with a minor commitment, I question whether that commitment was even authentic. When I'm about to say yes because everyone else is, I ask whether I'd say yes if I were alone.

The gap between stimulus and response got wider. And in that gap, I started making decisions that actually reflected what I wanted.

I didn’t even respond to her demand, I just stared blankly.. For context, I hate calling on the phone. Whenever I have doctor appointments or anything like that, I have her call them for me (big W in the chat for her!). Anyway, I don’t end up calling the police, so by the time she comes back she’s asking me if they’re on their way, and I reply with something like “no I didn’t, don’t you remember I have phone anxiety? You should respect my boundaries.” Well she was not happy with that, stating that she told the drivers I was calling and they’ll be on their way. My thought process is, well first I’m not a damn bootlicker to call them, and second, shouldn’t she know that I don’t like calling? Thats like saying “hey can you call your mortal enemy? WHILE HAVING PHONE ANXIETY??” Well she ended up calling them herself, and everything seemed fine and dandy after. We didn’t really talk about it afterwards, (only one time where she said she was disappointed), but I feel like she views me as some weakling or something and it’s been bothering me. Also by the way, we sometimes get coffee on our runs, but she didn’t even buy me coffee that time.

In late 2024, I naively switched to only a B12 supplement and completely crashed. By Nov 2025, I hit a total physical collapse with DPDR, numb limbs, and adrenaline dumps. 5 weeks back on my full B-complex rebuild, my vision is coming back, the numbness is mostly gone, and I’m finally reconnecting with reality. Don’t skip your cofactors! 

Hi everyone! (24F) Sorry for the long post but I believe that I am struggling with a pretty severe b vitamin deficiency.

For some background information, I got very sick with what I believe was Covid at the beginning of 2020. I was sick for about 4-5 weeks. When I came out of the sickness, I instantly became lactose intolerant. I used to have lactose all the time from yogurt, glasses of milk, cheese and cream in my coffee but I could no longer tolerate it. So I ended up cutting out all lactose from my diet. Within 3-4 months after doing that, I began experiencing  alarming symptoms! My hands and feet went numb - I would touch my arm and I literally couldn’t feel it. I was also having out of body experiences where I felt completely disconnected from myself (depersonalization/derealization symptoms). I ended up going to the ER because these symptoms were so alarming and they were scaring me. Once I got there, the ER doctor asked me how my diet was. I ate very healthy and nutritious meals but I let him know that I cut out all dairy from my diet. He told me that it wouldn’t cause the symptoms I was experiencing and told me I probably just have anxiety… so I left feeling pretty defeated. During that time my family member told my aunt about my ER visit. I guess my aunt had just went vegan 5 weeks before this and was experiencing the same symptoms that I was but worse! She told me she couldn’t feel her limbs (like me) but also that she felt like she was going blind, especially while driving! So she went to the doctor and she told her it sounded like a b12 deficiency and she bought a fully methylated b complex and within 3 days, she was fine. I decided to take the b complex that she was taking, and within 2-3 days, I was back to myself! It was crazy! So I just assumed that because I was lactose intolerant, I will always need to take a b12 supplement. 

I was on that supplement for 4.5 years and it worked great for me! Around October 2024 I got off of the b complex and just bought a methylated b12 supplement from Thorne. I didn’t know anything about methylated vitamins or the other b vitamins - I naively thought I just needed a b12 supplement. I still felt good but my energy levels began to decrease. I found it harder to find the motivation to go to the gym and was sleeping a lot more and waking up still feeling tired. I was also dealing with some personal stressors that were separated from this deficiency. Regardless, by July I began experiencing that out of body feeling again. This was accompanied by many other symptoms such as: 

\- brain fog / derealization, depersonalization 

\- Unable to regulate emotions (like normal)

\- Sensory issues / not feeling touch

\- Numb hands and numb feet specifically toes and fingers 

\- Short term memory loss 

\- Headache (moderate) 

\- Dizziness 

\- Blurred vision and not being able to gauge distance 

\- Dropping things from hands / not feeling things in hands 

\- Mental health / leading to anxiety and depressive thoughts 

\- Extreme fatigue

\- Muscle aches 

\- Trouble with balance and coordination 

\- Shortness of breath, especially with exerting force 

\- Seeing floaters and sparkles in air 

\- Tmj on left side / scalloped tongue 

\- Loss of appetite/ acid reflux 

\- Sensitivity to light

\- Ringing in ears 

\- Trouble regulating body temperature and feeling more cold 

My family member told me I needed to go to the doctor because they were watching me go in a downward spiral for months. They told me they saw me doing everything I needed to do like working, going to school, cleaning my house but it took every ounce of energy out of me just to do these daily tasks. So at the end of September I made an appointment with my PCP to make sure everything was fine. I was concerned that I had low iron so I brought that up when talking to my PCP about this. They checked my ferritin (which was 72), so I knew that was in range and optimal. All of my other labs looked good so I was pretty confused as to why I felt this way.

Then in October 2025, the symptoms I had been experiencing had been getting so much worse! Going into grocery stores with fluorescent lights was making me dizzy, driving became very difficult because there was too much to process for my brain and walking up stairs winded me! All of the symptoms were causing me so much anxiety and I had terrible ruminating thoughts about my health. I felt so disconnected from my body and my loved ones; I would look at myself in the mirror, and not recognize myself. My vision felt like there was a foggy glass around it. I ended up getting sick with a virus at the end of October and the shortness of breath was getting bad so I rushed to the ER and the doctor told me I had gotten pneumonia. I left with 100mg of doxycycline to be taken twice a day for 5 days. Doxycycline destroyed my stomach! I couldn’t keep any food down, just for Kaiser to call me and tell me that they sent my x ray to a lab and it turned out, I didn’t have pneumonia after all! 

So in November, I thought maybe I do just have anxiety and need to get help for it. Talk therapy and grounding techniques weren’t working, so I  decided to find a psychiatrist at Kaiser and she prescribed me sertraline. I had never taken antidepressants before but was willing to try anything to alleviate these symptoms. The sertraline made everything way worse for me! I knew there was an adjustment period so I tried to stick it out but I was basically bed ridden. I was on 25mg for 10 days and then bumped it up to 50mg per my psychiatrists guidance. I was on Reddit one night and came across a post where someone was talking about feeling disconnected from their body but they took a hydroxy b12 because 40% of the population can’t convert the synthetic version of b12. Then I went back in my order history and found the b complex that I had been taking and saw it was fully methylated and that it wasn’t just a b12 but a complex of all the b’s. 

December: As I had been keeping in close contact with my psychiatrist I told her about the 2020 experience. She immediately jolted forward and told me I need to order a b12, b9 and b6 test from Kaiser. She told me that she believed “There was break in one my enzymes.” So I asked my PCP to order those tests for me.

12/4/25:

B12: 831 (range: 200-900)

B9: 9.2

B6: 40 (range: 30-125)

I was still on sertraline at this time for about 4 weeks, but now I was on 50mg and was getting panic attacks. My psychiatrist told me to begin tapering off of it and that we needed to address the underlying health conditions going on first. She said that yes, people can experience numbness because of anxiety but usually there is a temporary break from it. The fact that I had been numb mentally, emotionally and physically 24/7 since July, concerned her. I did more research and wanted to have a homocysteine and MMA test ordered for me. So I met with my PCP and and read her my long list of symptoms. I also made sure to tell her that I had GERD as a baby and now as an adult, I have very low stomach acid. She told me that all of my b tests were in range so she would not be ordering me any further testing. Furthermore, she told me that I should increase my dose of sertraline because majority of her patients find relief at 150-200mg. She also told me that my mind was just playing tricks on my body and that I was just anxious. I was enraged but decided to take matters into my own hands and got testing done at a private lab, Quest. 

12/18/25:

MMA: 200

Homocysteine: 8.4

Calcium: 9.3

Folate: 5.8

B12: 663

TSH w/ reflex to t4: 2.19

Iodine serum: 48

Vitamin D: 33

What I gathered from this is that my folate dropped a lot within 13 days as did my b12. My TSH jumped from 1.5 (end of September) to 2.19. Furthermore, my vitamin D was pretty low because the range is 30-100 and I was iodine deficient (range: 52-109). At this time I had developed a newer symptom: My tongue had these deep, inflamed scalloped edges all over it. It had a pale center but a red tip that burned! And it had a crack that was breaking apart down the center of my tongue and it made it painful to eat food. On top of that, I lost my menstrual cycle for 3 months, which has never happened to me before. 

Recovery:

In the beginning of January I began supplementing with that b complex. The dose is 2 tablets but I know when starting a methylation cycle that’s been stalled, I need to go low and slow. On the first day of taking 1 tablet from the b complex I was so thirsty! I couldn’t stop drinking electrolytes and water! But because I also have been diagnosed with PMDD I wanted to make sure all of my needs were being met through supplements and eating nutritious, healthy foods. Currently I’m on a low inflammatory diet, focusing on whole foods and staying away from highly processed foods. I decided to stack my supplements with 4-5 days in between each, so I could monitor my symptoms:

\- Igennus super B complex (1/3/26) #1 tablet

\- Partiqlar Magnesium glycinate 240mg (1/7/26)

\- Thorne Zinc picolante 15mg (1/11/26)

\- NOW Women’s probiotic 20 billion (1/15/26)

\- Switched from Claritin to Allegra (1/18/26)

\- NOW Vitamin D3 Mk-7 (1/20/26) 

\- Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omegas (1/27/26)

I am also drinking Dr. Berg’s electrolyte powder / 1 a day with water. I had an IUD replaced at the end of February 2025, and I was informed that IUD’s steal b vitamins, magnesium and zinc within the first year - year and a half while it adjusts to the body. I have always struggled with allergies and that’s why I use an antihistamine. But all of December and January I was struggling with histamine intolerance! I would get flushed and itchy with brain fog after eating healthy foods or showering! 

I just added the second tablet of the b complex on 2/4/26. It’s been wonderful! Since I have added the second tablet, my histamine issues seem to be going away now and I am feeling more connected to my body. My memory issues have gotten so much better and my hands and feet are no longer numb but they are tingly throughout certain times during the day. I am looking to get a genesight test but Kaiser views them an unnecessary and getting a practitioner to order it for me has been difficult. 

So my question is, has anyone ordered a genesight test and what was your experience with that? And is there anything else that I should add or be doing to help my body recover from this? I know I’m iodine deficient but I don’t know much about it so any advice would be super helpful! ",7,1770594306.0,B12_Deficiency,10,1.0,False

I never know how to start these, so here we go! I crave a genuine connection. Specifically the kind with banter, mutual curiosity, and that feeling where you don’t want the conversation to end. I miss that kind of connection and would really love to find it again.

I’m 27 and from the US (EST). I like to think that I’m pretty laidback overall. I’ve been described as “bubbly”, and once I’m comfortable I can definitely be quite talkative. I tend to open up more through actual conversation than listing off facts, but I’ll tell you a bit about me anyway!

Most of my free time is spent reading or watching movies/tv. I’m really into sci-fi, thrillers, and dystopian stuff. Basically anything that makes you think, freaks you out a little, or sticks with you for a while afterward. Some of my favorite shows are The Office (comfort show), Black Mirror, and The Sopranos. For movies, I loveee Interstellar and Star Wars, but I also have a thing for darker ones like Midsommar, Silence of the Lambs, and even Children of the Corn. And books… I go for the ones that really stick with me: Flowers for Algernon, 1984, and Tender is the Flesh are a few I keep thinking about. I’m always excited for recommendations, and I love discussing what worked (or didn’t) after we finish something!

Outside of reading and watching things, I’m pretty content with quieter interests. I love music and usually have something playing. I have an appreciation for puzzles/sudoku. I enjoy coffee, bookstores, museums, road trips, and exploring new places. I like writing things that are important to me down, saving quotes that resonate with me, and overthinking conversations long after they’re over. I also really enjoy podcasts. Especially ones about true crime, psychology, or interesting real life stories.

I’m also into sports, mostly football. I like hockey too, though I need to get back into it (maybe you can help?!). I’ve always loved history as well. There’s no specific era I focus on, just a genuine fascination with how everything connects (and repeats). That curiosity shows up a lot in my life. If something random catches my attention, I’ll happily spend hours falling down a research rabbit hole for no real reason other than interest.

I don’t think it’s necessary for us to have the same interests to get along. I value curiosity, effort, and genuinely wanting to show up for each other. I love listening to people talk about the things they are passionate about. Plus, I’m always open to being introduced to something new! 

If any of this resonates with you, I’d really love to hear from you! Either way, I hope you’re having a wonderful day or night wherever you are :)",2,1770594192.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1qzoiub,https://i.redd.it/sro0i7w07cig1.png,"Assorted thoughts on Sybil (Wayne, Wampus cats, grandmothers, the Forsyth family, etc.)","So. I've come down with a case of Sybil brain, where instead of the brain there's just Sybil rotating in there like a microwave. The only cure is either drinking more tea or making a post, and unfortunately I'm more of a coffee drinker IRL so... I'm making this post.

The following is just a list of various theories relating to Sybil I've been compiling for months, which I've decided to post now, less than a week out from Episode 5 releasing, so... We'll hopefully see soon which ones are actually correct and which ones aren't!

**1. The tea session**

Starting off with a relatively simple one: There are, I think, two purposes to why Sybil wants to do a tea reading with the MC.

The first is that she wanted to pass on a warning/some advice. Other people on this subreddit put it into words better than I did to sum up my thoughts on the matter: The tea reading might be bullshit (particularly since Mystical players can’t sense anything in the tea leaves), but the warning itself might not necessarily be. “The cat” might certainly not exist, but she has reason to warn you about someone close to you.

Mystical players can foresee the danger that comes throughout the week, so I feel it is almost certain that Sybil would also be able to see the future dangers that are going to plague the town, and specifically the MC. And given that she is more powerful than Mystical players, it's possible that she could see much more information, along with what she already knows about the town in general. So she seeks to give the MC a warning of the doom heading their way, and along with that, she specifically tries to dissuade them from trusting Tabitha, whether that's out of genuine concern or just manipulation for her own ends.

So then why doesn't she just tell the player this? Why the mystery and theatrics with the tea reading? And that's the second purpose I mentioned earlier: She wants the MC to drink her tea, and allow her some degree of control over them. So in order to achieve both goals, she dresses up her (possibly legitimate) warnings as tea leaves in order to covertly get you to drink it.

This control via tea is further connected to Sybil's urging for the MC to seek out all the other seals, which are seemingly connected to the Scarlet family's past deeds since the Collapse of 1918. She potentially knows what the stones are, and seems to have a vested interest in seeking them out. But Sybil might be unable to see most of the seals herself, since she mentions to the MC that she would be a hindrance in high-stress situations requiring physical activity given her age/physical ability. Thus, she has to rely on the MC to seek them on her behalf (or perhaps just needs the MC specifically to be the one to find them), hence one potential reason why she's aiming to control them. That, and maybe to also prevent them from doing something else later...

So based on this, what does Sybil want? Clearly not the same thing Tabitha does. Despite apparently working with her on the goat ritual, Sybil telling the MC not to trust her, and urging her to give up her years at the haunting make it seem like Sybil isn’t very loyal to the Scarlet family or their goals.

I'm very confident that what Tabitha wants (or at least believe she wants) and is working towards is a continuation of the status quo, where the mines continue running, the legacy is passed down to a new generation of Scarlets, and the supernatural rot at the heart of it all continues to fester. So then, Sybil would theoretically want something else: a break in the status quo of the town.

**2. Wayne**

These two obviously don't like each other. The first time you can see either of them in Episode 1, Sybil politely tells him to fuck off. She constantly dismisses him in front of the MC, tells everyone to ignore/leave him alone, advises for the MC not to trust him, and in turn, Wayne can threaten her right to her face if she ever harms the MC (I've seen this in the aftermath of the haunting if you used Booksmart and didn't bring along Tabitha).

That being said, when you accuse Wayne of being the cat during the tea session, she shoots down that idea: ""You shouldn't trust a word out of that man's mouth, but the cat implies a certain level of two-facedness that I don't think he possesses."" She again emphasizes his untrustworthiness, but also asserts that he's too straightforward for betrayal.

Not to mention, when you meet Sybil on Day 1, the very first thing we see from her is telling him ""Go home, Wayne. I can't help you tonight."" This is later compounded with a comment from Kaneeka when you tell her about Wayne: ""That creep who keeps coming around my mom's tea room? \[...\] Yeah... There's definitely something wrong with him.""

Given these comments, it seems confirmed that Wayne visiting Sybil's tea room is a regular occurrence. And when you try asking Sybil about Wayne directly (when she's taking you home from the ghost hunt without Tabitha) she tells you that it's not polite to ""share people's medical history,"" even mentioning the Hippocratic Oath as an excuse not to give you any information about him.

Given the implications, I feel confident in saying that Sybil is helping Wayne medically; but for what purpose? My first guess is that they're trying to keep the rotting body of what used to be Sam Wayne functioning for as long as possible. We can already see (and smell) that the body is NOT holding up too well...

So the fact that Sybil appears to be aiding Wayne, despite the fact that neither of them seem to like each other, to me points towards the idea that both of them are aiming for roughly the same goal. And I think based on their actions it's quite likely.

Sybil and Wayne definitely know way more than they're telling the MC, and they both chose not to openly divulge that information, seemingly wanting for the MC to dig up the truth themselves. Sybil and Wayne both express the desire for the MC to keep finding out the secrets of the Scarlet family; Wayne makes a remark when you tell him about the faking of Teddy's death (""Good. You're starting to see the holes, then. Look for more.""), as well as telling you to explore the estate with Tabitha not there to stop you. And if you accuse Tabitha of being the cat, Sybil comments about how Tabitha would not want you to find the stone seals (""Visions about your family's history sound like exactly the sort of thing she wouldn't want you to see. Who knows what kind of secrets she's trying to keep under wraps.""), and encourages you to continue seeking them out.

So what does all this mean? I think it means that the long-term goal of both Sybil and Wayne is the undermining of the Scarlet family and their power, and even a potential end to the curse over the Holler. This is why Sybil is ultimately willing to help Wayne, even though she clearly dislikes him.

It also potentially means that the clash between the two of them is based on how different their priorities and methods are in achieving the same goals. This is most clearly illustrated in how they view the Chapter 3 conflict: Wayne urges the MC to leave Charlie to rot instead of sacrificing their health, while Sybil clearly wants to put the spirit to rest, and is perfectly willing to sacrifice the MC/Tabitha's years.

I interpret Wayne's motivations here as doing whatever he can to try and keep the MC safe no matter what. But for Sybil, I believe it's motivated by a conviction of righting past wrongs by allowing Charlie to pass into the afterlife. Since the devs once talked about how themes of bloodlines, familial responsibilities, and whether the sins of the father are passed down to the children are major themes of Scarlet Hollow as a whole, ([this interview](https://youtu.be/MKXWZo3Ff10?si=BQpldGiffT-dQwwy), 32:55-35:56) I think that Sybil represents the worldview that yes, it is the responsibility of the children to rectify the the wrongs of the past, which is why she sees the loss of a Scarlet's years as a fair price to pay for Charlie's murder.

Also take note that she specifies that Tabitha should be the one to take the sacrifice because she is the one who lives in Scarlet Hollow and is, by approximation, the one who more directly benefits from the Scarlets' generational wealth and power over the town. Not saying that Sybil is correct, just that this is the logic I think she operates by. Well, besides the fact that she is most definitely planning on backstabbing Tabitha.

**3. Kaneeka (and Miles)**

So we know about how Sybil is to some degree mind-controlling/influencing Kaneeka through her tea, but we don't know why. Obviously, mind controlling anyone is a horrific thing to do, much less to your own daughter. But given how the devs are confident in getting people to actually see Sybil as a likeable character, I think that the reasoning behind WHY she's doing it won’t be so cut-and-dry, even if the act itself isn't really justifiable. Basically, it'll be something like the Doctor Kelly situation.

The first thing that jumps out to me is that the most blatant instances of mind control we see over Kaneeka is when Sybil is preventing her from going to the clinic in Chapter 4. And given that Sybil knows about Reese's condition and what does end up happening later on, it could be interpreted that this instance was motivated by protectiveness, that she didn't want Kaneeka in danger. This is, again, a somewhat understandable and even sympathetic motivation, even if it doesn't totally justify her actions.

So is that just it? Sybil mind-controls Kaneeka just to keep her out of dangerous situations? I think maybe it goes a little further than that, since it doesn’t fully explain why Sybil seems so determined to keep her stuck in Scarlet Hollow.

What really sticks out to me is that Kaneeka didn't always used to disbelieve in magic; she can tell you that as a child, she desperately wanted to believe in magic, and even in the present day she likes magical girl anime. But despite living with an ACTUAL magical girl (her mom), she became a skeptic in the supernatural. Compare this with Sybil telling you how she was taught by her grandmother stories about the Ditchlings, and was likely taught actual magic. And yet, despite Kaneeka being much more open to the possibility of magic as a child, Sybil doesn't seem to have taught her anything about magic. Sybil has laughed off the suggestion that's a witch to other members of the town, including the MC, but that seems to even extend to her daughter. So why Kaneeka?

I know that it’s a popular theory that Sybil is keeping Kaneeka in the town because she wants her to become the next owner of the general store or even become the next Witch, but if that had truly been her goal from the start, then why does it seem like Sybil hasn’t tried to teach Kaneeka anything while she was growing up? Especially compared to, say, Pearlanne?

Pearlanne drills into Tabitha her duty to run the mines in the future from a young age, and as soon as she graduates high school, immediately starts teaching her how to run the mines. By comparison, Kaneeka is even able to leave Scarlet Hollow to go to college and study to become a vet (even if that ended up being temporary). In general, Sybil didn't previously (up until her husband died) act like someone hoping or expecting for her daughter to take up the family legacy, either of taking over the general store or becoming a witch. At least not in the ways we would be expecting.

Adding onto this weirdness: while Sybil is clearly manipulating Kaneeka's sense of responsibility to pressure her into staying in Scarlet Hollow, she's also deliberately keeping her in the dark in regards to what's actually going on in the town; when everyone tries to talk about what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Chapter 3 haunting, Sybil shuts the conversation down. When Kaneeka asks to tag along with the MC's tea reading, Sybil tries to dissuade her by bringing up how bored she was with them in the past, and then proceeds to make her feel unwell enough that she retires to her room. Basically, Sybil is seemingly doing her best to not just specifically keep her from leaving town, but basically from doing or learning anything?

To tie this back to my previous thoughts about Sybil's goal being to disrupt the status quo; Sybil seems like she's not anticipating for Kaneeka to take over the position of the Witch in the way her ancestors have, implying that Sybil's expecting to be the last Witch. I almost have to wonder if she's just manipulating Kaneeka into staying out of the way as much as possible as Sybil gets to work trying to control the MC. And since it's established that bad things happen when someone attempts to leave the town, is Sybil's control of keeping her in the town a roundabout, misguided attempt to keep Kaneeka safe from the curse, since attempting to leave the town leads to nothing good? At least until it’s broken?

Again, I don't think this totally justifies the mind control; but it does make her motivations far more sympathetic instead of just keeping Kaneeka in town and making her miserable for the sake of tradition.

And then finally: how the heck does Miles fit into all this? He's mostly presented as a bratty teenager who doesn't care about anything beyond his Dragonball game, but when you do ask him about whether his mom's a witch, he either ignores you or outright says yes. He never denies that she is a witch.

So is he being sarcastic, or does he genuinely know about Sybil's mystical abilities when Kaneeka doesn't? He also shows up when the MC attempts to leave with Kaneeka for the clinic, and has no reaction beyond just glaring menacingly. But is that just the typical gaze of a bored, resentful teenager, or is it something deeper?

We do know that Sybil is far more lenient with Miles than she is with Kaneeka, and this is a major point of friction in the family. It can be assumed that he probably drinks her tea, though we don't see him actually doing so, nor do we see (or sense if you're Mystical) Sybil exerting control over him. I think this is probably because Sybil's never really needed to? Miles says that his mother is ""the nicest lady ever,"" and we never see him rebuke her the way Kaneeka does. So perhaps because Miles is generally more obedient to his mother and is at no real risk of actually leaving Scarlet Hollow, Sybil doesn't feel the need to keep as much away from him?

Or perhaps there's something about Kaneeka that isn't present with Miles, causing Sybil to treat the two differently? Maybe something like magical potential? I'm operating off the assumption that he doesn't have the same magical potential that Kaneeka does, again because Mystical doesn't note anything of the sort that it can with Kaneeka, but we don't know for sure...

**4. Sybil's grandmother**

To now switch gears: Sybil tells you that her family has lived in the area for a long time, possibly even before the Scarlets, and that everything she's learned was ""handed down from generations of hill folk."" She says that before she married into the general store, her family were “standard hill folk” who kept to themselves, meaning that we probably have limited information from anyone else about Sybil’s family. Avery comments that Sybil ”makes it impossible to really get to know her,” implying that even when she’s more integrated with the town, she’s still holding back a lot of information about her life.

Now, there's a TON we don't know about Sybil, her family, and the secrets she's most definitely hiding, but for this portion of my thoughts I've generally been assuming that there's no de-aging/body-hopping/immortality shenanigans going on and she truly is an older mortal woman, albeit one with very strong mystical powers. I get that it might be foolish to trust anything she says, but at the same time, I don't think there's concrete evidence that Sybil is lying about her true age, so I feel safe in just taking her at her word for this particular instance. And also, because I think this assumption dovetails very nicely to another theory that I think will happen.

To start off: Sybil has made a few mentions of her grandmother during the game so far. First example that comes to mind is when you visit her in Chapter 1; she says that it was her grandmother who taught her the stories about ditchlings, and that she was rarely wrong. She also says that the chaga/lemon tea recipe that’s specifically for helping out with visions and which she gives to the MC on Day 2/Day 4 was from her grandmother. Given the fact that she has been mentioned a few times already, and in conjunction with major supernatural/magical elements in the story, I think the grandmother is important. So is she someone we might already know?

Sybil says that she's slightly older than Vivian and Pearlanne during the tea room scene in Chapter 4. When reviewing the Scarlet family death certificates, you can pin down that Pearlanne was 58, almost 59, at the time of her death, which would mean that Sybil would have to be in her sixties currently (probably her early sixties), which would place her date of birth somewhere around, say.... 1958-1962?

Now, let's go to the Witch of Charlie's memories.

Much to the frustration of Tabitha and other Scarlet Hollow theorists, Charlie's play sequences are not time-stamped. The most we have to go off of is that Edwardine was pregnant at the time of Charlie's death, and that all of Edwardine's children were born from 1945 to 1947. If we assume that the events leading up to Charlie's death take place around or shortly before this time period, then that would be roughly ten or so years before Sybil was born.

As for the age of the Witch....  We have VERY little to go off of. Charlie calls her an ""old broad,"" and that's about it. And it could mean anything, I think. She could range from anywhere in her eighties or even late fifties.

So you might be seeing the question I'm trying to ask here: Does the timeline match up for Sybil's mentioned grandmother to be the same Witch from Charlie's time? And I would put in a tentative yes, there's still a decent chance that the Witch from Charlie's time period went on to live long enough to teach a young Sybil all of her knowledge.

Also worth noting that there was another mention of a Witch before that; one that Enoch enlisted the help of in the aftermath of the 1918 Collapse. I think most people (including myself) have assumed that this must be the same Witch from Charlie's memories, but working on this theory has made me reevaluate that maybe it's actually different people? It certainly is still very possible that those two Witches are in fact the same one, and perhaps Sybil's grandmother is the one who's different from that specific Witch. Still related, like a daughter, but not the same person.

Therefore, much like how the Witch from Enoch's time aided him in doing *something*, and then the Witch from Charlie's time offered him some ""help,"" now Sybil is aiding Tabitha in some kind of ritual involving herbs and a goat. Almost like this is a family position...

**5. Family tree parallels**

So, going off the idea that the Forsyths are in fact, a lineage of Witches that have seemingly been associated with the Scarlets for generations now, I think that the Forsyths are intended to act as a parallel to the Scarlet family, both in the past and the present. The similarities are there: Both seem to have mainly women as the ones holding the power/being the ones calling the shots, and both are inextricably tied together based on whatever happened in the past and the curse over the town.

Kaneeka and Tabitha are very similar to each other, both of them struggling with the weight of familial responsibilities against their own desires, and both of them being in roughly the same generation. Sybil would therefore be the equivalent to Pearlanne/Vivian, given that she knew them growing up. Whoever Sybil's parents are would correspond with the ""lost generation"" of Scarlets; Mary-Belle and Alexandra, and finally, according to my theory, Sybil's grandmother - potentially the Witch that approached Charlie - would be the equivalent to Edwardine, a woman who has had to raise her grandchildren in lieu of her children dying. Perhaps this is going to be another parallel to Sybil; she hasn't mentioned her parents at all compared to her grandmother, maybe because she was raised by the latter?

This might open the possibility that there was another Witch before the one from Charlie's memories, the one that worked with Enoch to enact the curse - OR it could have just been a younger version of that same witch, who is still active when Edwardine becomes an adult.

Either way though, my personal interpretation of where the story is heading in regards to the Forsyths is that they are going to be a very important part of the central mystery and will play a big role in how the whole story pans out.

So, remember what I said about how I think Sybil believes in people having a responsibility to resolve their forebearers' terrible deeds? I think that if she is indeed breaking from the family tradition of assisting the Scarlets with maintaining the curse, that she is applying that same belief system to herself and her own family. After all, it was one of her ancestors that seemingly aided Enoch in enacting the curse over the town, preventing people from actually leaving, and the symbolism in Charlie's sequence of the Witch (flowers that appear sweet but are actually poisonous) calls into question her motives: is it just Charlie's subjective interpretation of the Witch with the foresight of her actions having led to his death? Or is it an actual indication that she was purposefully lying to him, putting on a helpful act to trick him into being killed by Edwardine?

Whatever it is, I think it's clear that the Witches of the past - Sybil's family - have been just as immoral and callous as the Scarlets of the past. And in the present, she believes it is on her to finally break the cycle her ancestors had started, by any means necessary, and she wants the MC to do the same.

**6. Wampus cats**

And now to jump into something random! I promise, this will tie it all together lol.

IIRC, it was already confirmed that the various cryptids described by the library book (which can be found on Day 2 with the Booksmart trait) are meant to be foreshadowing for future events, and one of the cryptids that we haven't quite gotten confirmation on is the wampus cat. Now, I've seen some fans say that they thought it was just meant as a reference to the mountain lion situation and Stella's steadfast refusal to believe in them; and it certainly is that! But I'm not convinced that its only purpose was to just set up a joke. I believe that the wampus cat is meant to be symbolic of Sybil's character.

In particular, the fact that the wampus cat's entry focuses on two different origin stories is what piques my interest. In one of those stories, it's about a woman seeking revenge against a monstrous cat demon for driving her husband mad, and using the mask of a bobcat, “freeing the people of their region from its evil.” In the other, it's about a woman hiding under the pelt of a wild cat and witnessing “forbidden hunting rites” she wasn't supposed to see, resulting in her being fused with the pelt and “transformed into a creature that was neither human nor cat.” I think both of these stories might apply to Sybil.

First is the tale of retribution that almost comes across as heroic, and which brings into mind the fact that Sybil's husband had died a year previously before the events of the current game. There's a really compelling theory posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScarletHollow/comments/1jgijvk/sybils_motives_goals/) (which frankly influenced a lot of my theorycrafting in this post) in which the OP points out how Sybil may be motivated by the genuine love for her husband and the bitterness and grief from his death (which was caused by Kaneeka leaving), and has therefore resolved to enact revenge on what killed him; the town itself and the curse over all its inhabitants. Thus, she mirrors the woman in the story who kills the demon.

The second tale is interesting, in that the book specifically points out how it's a story that discourages rebelling against tradition. If Sybil is indeed seeking to destroy the town, breaking with her ancestors by rebelling against the status quo, then could this story be pointing out the ways in which pursuing this goal makes her monstrous? Or does it foreshadow a dark fate for her?

And finally, I have some pieces of evidence that is VERY silly and probably shouldn’t be taken seriously at all, but I have the dire need to share it: There’s a certain character in Black Tabby’s OTHER game who takes the form of a sly, treacherous woman with feline attributes, a mix between a human and a cat, you might say. And what is she known as? The Witch.

Also, wampus cats are thought to have been based off of mountain lions. You know what other name mountain lions are known by? A cougar. Sybil is an older woman that you can romance while young. You know a slang term for that? Yep - a cougar.

**7. A very fringe theory**

So, this is where I officially leave theorycrafting and fully embrace the batshit crazy speculation/wishful thinking. If you’re still here, bear with me:

The expanded Duke route in the Roads Untravelled reveals that Duke really doesn't like Sybil. We’re also introduced with him holding a serious grudge against mountain lions and trying to hunt one down. Given the association between Wampus cats and mountain lions, and that I proposed that Wampus cats would be representative of Sybil, Duke’s disdain for mountain lions being a parallel to his disdain for Sybil is a pretty fun metaphorical tidbit! But… What if it’s not just metaphorical?

I’m saying, what if Sybil can turn into a mountain lion?

I know, it’s a MASSIVE jump to go from her subtly controlling everyone through magical tea to her turning into a fucking cougar, but we already have a dead body being reanimated by goop and Reese being able to turn into a Jersey Devil/some sort of horse-bat monster, so I really don’t think it’s out of the question! Given that she’s far more powerful than a Mystical MC, who knows what kind of wacky magic she can do? Plus, the only major monstrous love interests we have so far are both male; maybe Sybil could help balance that out if she also had a monstrous form of her own? Maybe a monster form would allow her to more easily participate in major events, or maybe it’ll be part of the big finale to really make things go up to 11.

Or maybe I just really like the idea of Sybil turning into a big cat. I just think it’s neat.

**8. Conclusion?**

I didn’t mean for this to get so long, I swear. I’ve been gathering these theories for a while, and now that the release of Chapter 5 is finally on the horizon, I decided I wanted to post these thoughts now before they become outdated.

I feel like a lot of the theories I’ve put forth here are trying to find some sort of sympathetic reasoning behind Sybil’s actions, and that perhaps it’s possible I’m giving her far too much grace than she deserves. But I really do feel like the devs want to make her as multifaceted as a character just like all their other characters, and so I hope I was able to provide somewhat plausible theories about why she is the way she is.

Thank you for reading, genuinely. I’m probably going to dip from the subreddit when Episode 5 comes out to avoid spoilers (at least until I think I get a good enough picture of everything that happens), but I’ve enjoyed seeing a lot of the discussion here about the game, and this is the first new chapter release I’ll be experiencing since joining the fandom! So I’m really excited!

Whatever happens, enjoy your returns to the Holler on Friday the 13th!",22,1770593828.0,ScarletHollow,2,1.0,False

1qzog3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1qzog3j/colleague_demands_a_doctors_note_from_me/,Colleague demands a doctor’s note from me?,"I’m feeling so frustrated and unsure what to do, would really appreciate some advice from fellow baristas :)

I work in a family run cafe and one of our most popular items is freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff all agree that it’s the most annoying and tedious drink to make, but customers love it so what can you do.

I’ve had really bad eczema since I was a baby, and when I make the fresh orange juice it flares up really badly on my hands and arms because little bits of orange fly out of the juicer and onto my skin. I’ve tried wearing long sleeves and gloves but nothing works. It sounds very dramatic if you don’t have eczema but it’s so so painful, and one day I had to make so much orange juice that my arms ended up bleeding. 

I showed my colleague Jack (who is the owner’s son) my arms and asked him to please make any more orange juice if it was ordered and I would cover whatever he was doing. He said “you need to go to the doctor and get an allergy test, and if it turns out you’re allergic then I’ll make the orange juice for you”. In that moment I thought okay fair enough, it is after all the worst task so maybe I’m wrong for asking someone else to do it.

The next day though I was working with the owner and I mentioned to him how making the orange juice irritates my skin and showed him my arms, and immediately he said I shouldn’t be making it anymore. For the rest of the shift he made all the orange juice for me and I was really grateful.

Today I was working with Jack again. After every orange juice I was trying to wash my hands and arms super thoroughly, which helped to an extent but it was still irritated and painful, and I was getting really behind on the other drinks. I asked Jack to help out, but he once again said “if you turn out to be allergic I’ll make it”. Given that the owner stepped in no questions asked, Jack’s insistence that I must see a doctor before he helped out really annoyed me. I pushed back by saying that whether I’m allergic to oranges or not, the reaction it causes on my arms and the pain I feel is the same, and it doesn’t just hurt in the moment my skin is angry and irritated for days afterwards. He just walked off after I said that, didn’t even respond. 

I was so upset by his refusal to help me out and the fact that he literally stood right next to me playing on his phone whilst I had to make more orange juice. I eventually said “I’m not making it any more. You can make it yourself or tell customers that we don’t have any. I’ve already spoken to your dad and he said I shouldn’t be making it.” Jack then agreed to make it, but I’m still feeling really annoyed at the whole thing. I don’t know why seeing my arms bleeding wasn’t enough for him to take me seriously, or why he demanded I see a doctor before he would help out with the orange juice. And although he eventually helped out today, I know what he’s like and i know that in the future he’ll go right back to standing on his phone whilst I make it. There are so many things he does at work that bother me and certainly wouldn’t fly if it was anyone else (he doesn’t even clean the coffee machine when he closes, for example) but I don’t want to bring anything up with the owner because that’s his son, he’s not gonna ever get into any trouble so why would he change what he’s doing?

I guess I just wanted to rant, but also to hear anyone’s thoughts if I’m overreacting by being annoyed? I also worry that I should just thug it out because the orange juice is so popular and I fear that it’ll be seen as me not being able to do my job properly :(",3,1770593618.0,barista,3,1.0,False

I don’t know if I should tell him or just go along and hope for the best,"I feel really bad, and I don’t even know what to say but the thought of it is stressing me out.

im 6 months pregnant right now, and ever since I got pregnant he’s been on the idea of moving out of the main city. we went to look at properties and hes been showing me houses on huge properties, surrounded by fields and trees and not a lot of neighbours. every place has been 20-30 minutes away.

one of my Main concerns is that he travels for work, and I’m scared to be alone at night that far from town. normally I go with him but, I’m pregnant and once the baby is here I won’t be.

i told him that and he thought it was hilarious because it will be way safer than our current home. he said we could put a “safe room” in.. which helps but I still feel really scared

this was a totally new thing too, he never mentioned it before. he owns a company that is less than 10 minutes from our house so I never thought hed want to move too far.

i feel so bad that I’m not excited, he is very into the idea of raising our family outside of the main town/city, growing a lot of our own food and I get where he’s coming from, it sounds nice in theory but I honestly want to stay here so bad.

all my friends are within a 10 minute drive, grocery stores, hospital, coffee shops, everything is very close. our neighborhood is great, gated, and I’m about to be a first time mom.  Even a bit nervous about once he’s back working full time, I hate the idea of being so far from town with a newborn. I know people do it, I’m just nervous.

i just don’t really know if I should tell him, or go along with it and hope for the best. keep in mind, I wouldn’t be paying for anything and don’t pay bills currently. I worked before I was pregnant but stopped completely when I started having complications… even when I worked however never came close to his Income so money wise he takes care of everything, which is why I don’t know if I should tell him how I feel. I feel so guilty, the houses he’s showing me are people’s dream homes.. i know he’s trying so hard and wants to do what’s best for me/our daughter but I can’t get Myself on board :( ",36,1770593266.0,relationship_advice,120,0.79,False

I was young and stupid at that time and I don’t understand why we went there in the first place. But, now everything is different, I am different. What you are about to read happened many years ago. You can believe me or not but be warned, do not venture out into the wild in ignorance, I have a hunch where we went isn’t Her only dwelling place.

So, let’s start from the beginning of that awful trip.

**Part 1: Arrival**

I moved my head from the car window and wiped the condensation off to get a better look at the frozen landscape outside. Passing by were tall street lights, faintly illuminating the ground beneath them. The morning sun peeking over the horizon, however, gave us the most light. Beyond the lights were walls of dark green on either side of us; we had only seen trees for a few miles at that point.

Even though I wasn’t the biggest fan of snow or dreary weather, I was pretty excited for that trip, though looking back, I wish I wasn’t. With all the responsibilities that come with work and the kids, I thought it’d be good for the guys and I to have some time away from society. I wasn’t familiar with the land itself, but I was well aware of the stories about the Hoia-Baciu Forest. It always used to creep me out as a kid, hearing about the disappearances and all. But, It wasn’t my choice for a fun vacation spot, but once Darius set his mind on going, it was hard for David and I to convince him otherwise.

We made the mistake of taking David’s car because, of course, he forgot to top off the gas before we left. But what else can you say about him? He’s the lovable idiot of the group, or at least I thought he was. We didn’t have much farther to go anyway. The traffic was slow, probably because the winter solstice was coming up and people were traveling to see their loved ones. I was glad we brought the right gear because, even though we were in the car, the air was getting cold. I had already put on my wool mittens.

“Justin, come help me with this,” Darius said as he waved me over to the trunk. David followed suit.

We brought a whole assortment of stuff—tents, food, lamps, and other typical camping items.

“Why did we have to pack so much?” David said. “We’re only spending a few nights here, and I don’t want to stay longer than I have to. It’s already giving me the creeps.”

“Just try to enjoy yourself, okay?” Darius responds.

“It’s not often we get to have a guys’ trip, so let’s make this one count,” I said, trying to look on the bright side.

It only took a few minutes to grab our bags and equipment from the car, and we headed toward the forest’s entrance.

Just a few minutes past the tree line, I noticed a light fog rushing over the frozen ground. If it had been nighttime, it would have been a different story, but with the morning light shining down and reflecting off the snow, it looked straight out of a fairy tale—almost mesmerizing.

“See, David? Nothing to worry about,” Darius said in an almost antagonizing way.

The forest was alive: wind grazed the tops of the trees, birds sang to one another, and curious foxes peeked out of the brush to say hello, only to dart away shortly after, leaving paw prints in the snow. The forest was surreal, and I was glad we got to be a part of it.

“Let’s go off trail. Don’t you think it’ll be fun? I can see some activity just past those bushes over there. I can just imagine what we might find,” Darius said with an almost giddy attitude.

I didn’t think it was the greatest idea, but I begrudgingly went along, having to convince David to walk with us every step of the way.

The space between the trees grew smaller, and the fog thickened, making it harder to walk in a straight line or remember where we had left the trail. Still, it was nothing we hadn’t dealt with on previous camping trips, even though those were few and far between. The deeper we walked, the more active the wildlife became. I guessed the little critters weren’t expecting visitors in this part of the forest.

After walking for a while—going up small hills and jumping across creeks—we came across a clearing in the fog. Trees surrounded a patch of snow, almost forming a perfect circle, like the forest itself had created the ideal spot for us to set up camp.

We went around the area, picking up sticks and shoveling snow, making a few spots to pitch our tents. After a granola bar break, I got my tent up and helped David with his.

A bit later, we decided to start a fire pit.

“All this wet wood is no good—did you happen to bring some dry logs with you, since you’re such an expert at this, Darius?” David said.

“Why yes I did, fair maiden in need of rescuing!” He pulled a few dry logs from a separate bag, smiling at David.

“You know, part of me wishes you hadn’t,” David said under his breath.

“Don’t say stuff like that—we all have our responsibilities on the trip, and he’s doing his,” I said, trying not to cause any more dissonance in the group.

Once everything was assembled, it was relatively easy to get a fire going, though we probably should have waited until dark. The heat radiating from the flames was warm and cozy, helping me thaw my fingers and nose. I had always loved the sound of fire crackling over wood—it was comforting, and it always had been since my first camping trips with Mom and Dad.

“Here, take a look at all of these,” David said as he started pulling wrapped items from his bag. “Snacks!”

Granola bars, trail mix, dried meat, and various fresh fruits he had kept safe in his personal cooler.

“Wow, you really have outdone yourself, Dave,” I said.

“I know, right? The meat took me the longest to prepare, but I’d say these are my favorite,” he said as he handed out some fruit from the cooler.

They were little berries I felt like I had seen somewhere before, but one thing I could say for sure was that they were really tasty—almost like blueberries. David had already grabbed several handfuls for himself.

“Hey, slow down there, man. Don’t expect us to go rummaging for other berries in this forest. I don’t plan on taking a trip to the hospital,” I said.

“Yeah, you’re probably right,” he said, closing the cooler.

After finishing setting up camp, we all headed to our tents. Luckily, I was well prepared for my beauty sleep. I brought a large blanket, a sleeping bag, a big fluffy pillow, and—last but not least—my trusty personal heater.

“It’s starting to get dark,” I said under my breath, rubbing my hands together in front of the heater to stay warm. I could already see my breath clearly. The shadows of the trees had grown long, casting themselves over the snow. I was pretty tired from all the walking and ready for bed.

**Part 2: Strange Happenings**

A few hours passed, and I still hadn’t fallen asleep. I knew it was a bad habit I needed to break, but I couldn’t help it when my mind started to race. Still, that wasn’t what kept me up—I felt uneasy.

The wind howled through the trees, loud enough that I couldn’t hear anything else. It was strange, though. The wind sounded different here, more… vocal. Normally I wouldn’t have thought much of it, but I wasn’t familiar with this land, and I kept wondering what kind of animals might have been out there in the dark—ones I couldn’t hear—waiting for me to shut my eyes.

Just thinking about it put me in a cold sweat and made my hands start to shake badly. I needed to sleep. Maybe the wind would die down soon.

In the morning, after a few hours of not-so-pleasant sleep, the wind had stopped, but it had caused snow to pile up around our tents, making it difficult to step out without snow falling in. Fog had also settled into the clearing—I must not have noticed it come in during the night.

I was the first one up. I hadn’t been able to sleep much anyway. So much for the first night going well.

“Morning, sunshine,” I heard a voice from my right. It was Darius, stepping out of his tent.

“Were you able to get some rest?” I asked as I started getting the fire going again.

“I did—slept like a baby,” he said, letting out an annoyingly audible yawn while stretching.

“So… the wind didn’t keep you up last night?”

“What do you mean?”

“The wind that piled the snow up around our tents,” I said.

“No, I don’t remember hearing any wind. Actually, it was a pretty quiet night, if I remember correctly.”

That couldn’t have been right. It had been so loud.

“Huh… that’s strange. But what about the sno—”

“Here, let me help you with that,” he said, interrupting me as he stepped over to stoke the fire. He must have had a hard sleep, I thought to myself.

A little while later, after David woke up, we decided to push deeper into the heart of the forest. The sky was cloudy, and the fog hung thick in the air, casting a gray, dreary haze over everything.

“This fog is making everything wet and cold,” David remarked. “Dang it—that’s what I forgot to bring. A nice pot of hot coffee to warm us up,” he added, finishing the thought out loud.

We kept moving forward, trying to stay close together, and after a bit we stopped.

“I’ve got an idea,” Darius said. He walked up to a tall tree, pulled out a knife, and etched a triangle into the bark.

“Hey, that’s a smart one,” I said. He grinned, proud of himself—like a kid admiring their own Play-Doh masterpiece.

After that, every fifty feet or so, we carved a triangle into the biggest tree we could find to help guide us back—a breadcrumb trail through the forest, like Hansel and Gretel—though I didn’t plan on finding a witch out here.

We had traveled a good distance from our site and found a small creek to follow, with rocks of all sizes and shades of gray. Every now and then, I found an interesting one to add to my collection. I found a really cool green one along the water. This fog, on the other hand, troubled me—I couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead of us. The fog felt different here; one moment we had a clear line of sight, the next it was impossible to see our feet. But we were still together, and that was what mattered.

“Maybe we should start marking trees closer together,” I told Darius up ahead, looking down at the creek.

“Yeah, you’re probably right.” He walked over and etched a triangle into the nearest tree. He lifted his head to look around, trying to find the last one he marked, then turned to me with a worried look.

“Justin, where’s David?”

Confused, I turned around. “What do you mean? He’s just right here behind—”

Gone. Nowhere to be seen.

My heart started to beat heavy in my chest. “I just heard him walking a few seconds ago. Where could he have gone?” I said.

“David—”

We started yelling. “DAVID! David, buddy, where are you?!”

Nothing. No response. Not even a faint noise.

“Maybe he headed back to camp?” I said nervously.

“Yeah… yeah, he probably did. Let’s go back.”

The walk back was unpleasant. Every now and then we called out for him, only for the trees to echo our voices back at us. I could tell the temperature had dropped; my lungs were starting to hurt.

The forest was calm, too calm.

“Hey, Darius,” I said. “Have you noticed anything strange since David disappeared?”

“What do you mean?” he responded.

“Look around—the animals. I haven’t seen or heard any of them for a while now.”

Darius looked around, then paused, noticing that what I said was true. “Huh… yeah. I haven’t either. Strange.”

“Maybe all of our yelling scared them away?” I asked, trying to find an explanation.

“That’s probably it. I just wish they’d come back, though,” he said. “I could use the company.”

We continued calling out, and again, nothing. The markings on the trees had been helpful; because of them, we were starting to recognize the surrounding area.

“We need to pick up our pace if we want to get that fire going. Maybe David will see it and find his way back,” I said, and we quickened our steps. The ground had frozen over and crunched under our feet with every step.

“Do you smell that?” Darius asked as he turned to me.

I paused a moment, tried to pick up what he was talking about, and… I did. It was pungent and had a sickly sweet smell to it.

“Yeah, I do. Must be a dead animal,” I said.

Darius’ face turned worried. “You don’t think—”

“No, it’s not him,” I said, trying to calm him down. “Try not to think about that. He’s fine and he’ll make his way back, I promise you.”

That seemed to comfort him. We continued our walk with Darius leading. The light was starting to wane, and the shadows of the forest were growing longer.

Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Squish.

Darius jumped back. “Gross! What was that?” He gasped and looked down to examine his shoe.

My eyes turned to the ground, just barely lit by the dimming sky, to see what it was.

“It… it looks like a rabbit, but—what happened to it? The poor thing’s all twisted up.”

Its body was like that of a wrung-out towel, and it had a gaping hole in one side that exited the other. But, most gruesomely of all, it was half rotted.

We both covered our noses, trying not to let in the awful smell.

“It must’ve been here for ages to be looking like that,” I said.

“But what caused the hole? A… predator maybe?” asked Darius, trying to make sense of it all.

“I’m not sure, but… that has to be it. Yeah, just a predator. Let’s keep moving, I can hardly see my hands anymore.”

I lifted my head back up to continue walking, but before I took a step—plop.

Something hit my shoulder with a loud thud.

“Ouch!” I winced as I grabbed my shoulder. “What was—”

I looked down once more. A fox, or at least what looked like one. Twisted and bloody, with the same gaping hole.

“Where did it come from?” Darius said, looking at me with a confused look.

Both of our eyes looked up into the tops of the trees.

“What in the—”

Birds, bunnies, frogs, foxes, and every other animal local to the land were skewered onto the branches of the tree, twisting and intertwining with itself through the rotting meat, almost as if the tree itself had grown through them.

My stomach dropped, and my heart started to drum in my ears.

“Darius—” I said as I looked over to him. “We need to get out of this forest.”

His gaze didn’t falter from the blood-covered limbs, and he was unable to move, like the forest floor had taken hold of his legs and did not wish to let go.

“Darius,” I whispered. “DARIUS!”

He snapped out of the trance. “Wa— a… yeah, yeah, let’s go.”

We started running through the brush, stumbling as we went and scraping the sides of our legs and arms. We were just barely able to see the triangles on the trees, but then I started to notice something horrifying.

“They’re everywhere…” I said under my voice.

Every other tree was another horrible sight. More animals, more blood, more rot. I started to get sick to my stomach, trying not to gag at the smell. My feet were starting to get weak from the running.

“Not much farther,” I said while panting. “I can just about see the clearing!” I yelled back to Darius, who had a look of disgust on his face.

Crunch, crunch, squish, crunch, squish, crunch, crunch. We kept stepping on them. They were all falling off the branches, as if trying to hit us.

Before we knew it, we made it back to camp and tried to catch our breath. I vomited in the nearest bush.

After a moment of silence, Darius and I got the fire started again, this time with more wood, in hopes David would find his way back.

“He can’t be safe out there, with… with whatever is doing all of THAT out there, dude!” Darius said with a shaky voice.

“I know, I know,” I said, trying to make sense of it all. “I know we can’t leave him here…”

I didn’t care what was out there—he was our friend.

My eyes met Darius’. We both silently nodded in agreement, already knowing what to do.

We kept calling his name. Over and over, we called to him, but there was no response—nothing at all. I was beginning to lose hope; maybe I was just a bad friend.

Hours went by but no response came back. A wind had come through the camp, slightly swaying the trees as it went, causing them to creak. At least we got a response from something.

Darius and I finally decided to sleep after calling for David all night long. I was losing my voice, and my throat hurt whenever I spoke, but I wouldn’t stop looking for him. I couldn’t. He was out there somewhere, all alone.

We made our way to the tents, barely able to keep our heads up—either from exhaustion or desperation. Maybe both.

Another restless night. Of course it was. Why wouldn’t it be with David missing?

“Why is this happening…?” I asked myself as I pulled my sleeping bag over me. “We shouldn’t have come here. I knew it was a stupid idea. Those stories…” I shuddered.

My gaze drifted toward the opening in my tent, expecting something to be on the other side, only for there to be darkness.

“No—don’t think about it. Sleep. That’s what I need right now.”

I closed my eyes and waited to fade into slumber, with nothing but the stillness in the air to soothe me.

“Justin…”

My heart skipped a beat.

“Justin… please.”

It was faint and hoarse, calling from the dark.

I jumped out of my tent, my sight frantically darting toward the tree line. I didn’t see anything at all—but he was calling to me. I heard his voice as clear as day. My eyes jumped back and forth, from one shadow to another, searching for anything that resembled him.

“Please… help me.”

It was distant, but not too far—maybe a few hundred yards away. Worse than that, he sounded like he was in pain.

“Please…,” the voice said again.

I rushed over to Darius’ tent and tried to wake him. “Come on, why won’t you get up? I hear him, I hear David!” I said, pushing him, with an almost excited tone. But he was dead asleep.

“To heck with it,” I muttered, frustrated.

I couldn’t believe what I was about to do, but I was going out to find him alone—even though it was incredibly stupid. I couldn’t just sit there while he was screaming my name.

I packed some supplies into my backpack: some food, a knife, and my heater to keep me warm on the way there—and David warm on the way back. I could hardly see anything at that hour, and snow was starting to fall. Even though it was just a heater, I held it out in front of me, its weak glow pushing back the frozen dark, even with its irregular flickering.

The snow on the ground had gotten thicker around the camp, making it hard to walk without kicking it up into the air, but nevertheless, I pushed through.

“David!” I called out to him.

“Where can he be? This… this doesn’t make any sense,” I muttered to myself.

The crunching under my feet was loud, but my yelling was louder.

“David!” I yelled again.

No response.

My pace quickened. “David! Where are you?!”

“Justin… over here.”

My breath escaped me. Not far. Not far at all—just a few paces in front of me.

I broke into a sprint, or at least tried to, before falling into the snow and scrambling back up again.

“**HELP ME**!” the voice yelled with newfound strength.

It echoed through the forest, louder than I could ever be.

I stopped running. I paused.

My mind started to race.

“How is he able to scream like that…?”

But that wasn’t what was horrifying.

The scream came from behind me.

I froze in place, not wanting to move an inch. The hair on the back of my neck stiffened as I imagined what was behind me. But I dared not turn around. I knew it wasn’t him.

“**JUSTIN**!” the voice bellowed loudly, causing me to stumble to the ground.

“Why…?” I asked, my voice shaking. “What are you…?”

No response. All I could hear was the beating of my heart.

I propped myself up on one knee, and that thing shifted its weight in response. Then, a pause—a moment of stillness.

“Just… JUST GET AWAY FROM ME!” I yelled as I stood up and broke into a sprint.

It was fast—faster than me, I could tell—and its hulking legs thudded against the ground as it chased after me.

“Keep going, keep going,” I told myself over and over again.

“**PLEASE**!” it called from behind, its voice forcing the trees themselves to sway as it spoke.

“No… not like this, please,” I begged.

It didn’t listen. It quickened its pace—budadoom, budadoom, budadoom—like a horse of monstrous size, ripping through the snow-covered ground.

My legs were starting to give out. I couldn’t keep this up much longer, but—

“Justin…”

I heard it in front of me. This time it was weaker. This time it was human.

David. The real David. Pleading for me once again.

But before I could fully realize it—

crack.

I ran headfirst into the base of a tree, a chunk of bark forcing itself into my forehead.

**Part 3: Horrible Masterwork**

The next thing I knew, there was ringing—and a bright flash. Was I knocked unconscious? I didn’t know. But I could tell something was different. What was it? I asked myself, and then I realized—the thudding had stopped. It finally stopped.

I tried to open my blood-dripping eyes and saw… absolutely nothing. Just darkness. Dazed, I scanned the area for whatever that thing was, lurking somewhere in the dark.

“Where did it…,” I mumbled as I tried to stand on aching legs. But I noticed something else too—there were no tracks in the snow.

I reached up and touched my forehead. “Ow,” I winced at the cut. It was deep, but thankfully not too deep.

“I hate this forest. I hate that thing. And I hate this stupid fog. I hate it all,” I said to myself. I didn’t know if I could take this anymore. No—I couldn’t. And I didn’t want to.

I couldn’t find David. I didn’t want to anymore. I wanted to leave. “What am I thinking?” I said to myself. “What kind of a friend am I?”

I started to walk, but I stumbled. I needed to find my way back to camp and I needed to wake Darius. We had to leave this awful place.

What was this forest?

Why did it hate me?

I was able to walk—slowly but surely—and the blood dripping from my head stained the snow behind me.

“I can’t see anything,” I said to myself, peering through the dark. Then I realized I had my heater, but—where did it go? I must have dropped it when that thing was chasing me.

“Whatever,” I muttered. It was the least of my worries now.

I kept moving. One step. Two steps. I fell. Three steps.

“I’m going to make it out of here,” I told myself, trying to be brave.

But what was brave about abandoning your friend?

I took a few more steps and then—

“Eugh… what’s that smell?” I pinched my nose.

I looked around, but I didn’t see anything.

Then I made the mistake of looking up.

“David… no.”

His shoulders and legs were bent behind him, wrapped around the tree, like he was violently forced up there. His shoulders and hips protruded unnaturally from his skin. And just like the animals, roots were growing through him.

And worst of all—the rot.

“Wha… I… I’m so sorry, David,” I whimpered, staring at him, not even having the energy to cry.

I couldn’t be here anymore.

I was going back to camp.

I was going back to the car.

I was going back home.

I never wanted this.

I never did.

Never.

I took a step back, looking at his lifeless body once more, then turned and headed back toward camp.

I didn’t have the energy to run. One foot in front of the other—that was all I could think about right now. All I wanted to do.

I saw the camp way off in the distance. The fire was still going. “Did Darius finally wake up?” I asked myself, barely being able to stay awake. “After everything that happened, why does he do it now? I’m going to… to tell him everything. He—he deserves to kno—“

Thud.

I passed out before I could reach the campsite, face-first into the snow. I was finally able to get some rest.

**Part 4: The Witness**

I woke up warm, morning sunlight peeking through the treetops above. Darius sat by the fire, watching the flames dance across the logs. When he noticed me stir, he smiled.

“Hey, buddy. How’d you sleep? You’re lucky I found you when I did—you were just about frozen solid,” he said with a hearty laugh.

“Huh? What happ—ahh,” I winced, grabbing my forehead. A cloth was wrapped around it.

“That’s a pretty nasty cut you’ve got there,” he said. “I did some work on it, though—shouldn’t get infected.”

I yawned and tried to sit up. “What time is it?” I asked, nearly shielding my eyes from the light.

“About ten in the morning. You’re a hard sleeper, you know.”

Then it hit me.

“David!” I yelled. “I—I found him in the forest. H-he—” I couldn’t finish through the tears.

“Hey, calm down,” he said. “What are you talking about?”

“Why didn’t you wake up last night?!” I sobbed. “I tried and tried, but you wouldn’t move!”

“Justin…” Darius paused.

“Who’s David?”

“What?” I said as my stomach dropped. “How… Darius, what do you mean?”

“Well, you were mumbling that name during your sleep,” he said. “Who is this David you keep mentioning?”

“Stop playing, I mean it,” I yelled, pushing him away. “I went out last night and I found him, Darius. He’s dead—dead, do you hear me?!”

He stumbled back, confused, then walked forward again, closer.

“Justin, we’re the only ones here. There’s no David.”

Why was he saying these awful things? How could he joke about something this serious? He couldn’t—

“What?” I said to myself, looking around.

There were only two tents.

“You hit your head bad, okay?” he said. “You’re just imagining things. Here, take this.” He handed me a cup. “It’s coffee. It’ll make you feel better.”

I took a sip. It was good. Very good.

“But I thought David didn’t—”

Darius looked at me with a blank expression.

“I… never mind,” I said.

I finished my coffee, relishing every last drop, while Darius paced back and forth between the tents.

“Justin,” he said, stopping to look at me. “Let’s take a walk. It’s a beautiful day, and there’s something I want to show you.”

Confused, I agreed and started walking with him.

The forest felt… alright, actually. The sun was out, and it was a bit warmer. Darius seemed unusually happy—but he didn’t remember. He didn’t remember him. He didn’t remember David. Why? Why was he choosing to joke about this? Of all moments, now?

Had he lost his mind?

How could he?

David was gone, and I knew we would be too if we didn’t leave this dreaded place. But something felt different. Had something changed while I was gone?

There were still only two tents.

“You’ve been busy, huh?” I asked as I noticed the triangle markings on the trees. There were more of them now. A whole lot more.

“Oh yeah,” he said with a small giggle. “I got bored while you were out of it, so… I decided to spend my time with those.”

We kept walking in silence for a bit. I preferred it that way—I needed to clear my thoughts.

“It’s just such a beautiful shape, isn’t it?” Darius asked suddenly.

Confused, I hesitated before answering. “What are you talking about?”

“The markings on the trees,” he said. “The triangle. Her shape.”

I didn’t know what to say. Or what to think.

Her shape?

I was too tired for this.

“Darius, who’s sha—”

“Good news!” he cut me off. “We’re almost there.” He pointed ahead.

We came to a clearing.

It was strange—the trees were bunched tightly in the center, and then there was nothing for at least fifty feet around them. These trees were different. Thicker. Taller. Older. Their bark was dark as chocolate and rough. They cast perfect shade, like their own canopy.

A sense of peace came over me. I liked it here.

But one thing confused me.

Why were their leaves red?

“Come,” Darius said. “We need to get closer. You’ll see—you’ll see her.”

Before I knew it, he broke into a run straight toward the looming bundle of trees.

“Darius, wait—” I tried to stop him, to get an explanation, but it was no use. Once he stepped between the trees, he vanished into their shade.

Everything went quiet. Everything except for a slight breeze.

I couldn’t see what was past the trees. I was too far away—and I wasn’t sure I wanted to find out. My eyes drifted up to the leaves, but I couldn’t make out anything clearly. All I knew was that they were a deep red, unlike any of the others surrounding them.

Anxious, I paced back and forth, waiting for him. Waiting for an answer.

“What’s taking him so long?” I asked myself.

Before long, I saw him—walking out from those trees.

“So… what is it?” I yelled, raising my hand to block the sun.

“Come here…” I heard him say.

I took a few steps forward.

“Come to me…”

Something was off. I stopped walking.

As he drew closer, his face came into focus. It was grim.

“Darius, what’s going on?” I asked as I saw tears rolling down his face.

Then I realized—his mouth wasn’t moving.

“**COME**,” a deep, bellowing voice said.

A violent gust of wind slammed Darius back against a tree. His limbs twisted, roots burrowing into him.

“No…” I whispered, my head spinning, my heart pounding.

“NO!” I screamed toward whatever monstrosity lurked within.

Without hesitation, I sprinted away from the trees—but before I could get far—

“**OBEY**.”

I collapsed, the breath ripped from my lungs.

“W-what is ha—happening to me…?” I strained as I forced myself up.

One step. Two steps.

Keep going.

“**BOW**,” it demanded again, this time with such force that the trees splintered at their bases, swaying as if in worship.

With only escape in mind, I dragged myself across the ground, clawing forward.

“I’m almost there…” I told myself as I neared the outermost line of trees. If I could just get past them, I’d be safe—though I knew that was a lie.

“Come on!” I cried, forcing myself back onto my feet—until—

“*Please*...”

A whimper. A cry for help. Pitiful.

I stopped.

“*Please… come to me,*” it whispered softly, the voice brushing the back of my neck.

“I… need to get out of here,” I said—but I didn’t move. Why leave?

“I want to stay,” I told myself. “Maybe this is all a dream. Maybe she can wake me,” I muttered.

“Yes… I need to go back,” I said quietly. “She’s calling for me. She needs me. I… I need—”

“No!” I shouted, snapping out of it. 

I ran as fast as I could, past the markings—“*please*…”—past the bloody trees—“*stay*”—past the tents—“*don’t* *go*”—and finally toward the forest exit, while she called for me the entire way. How I escaped that horrible forest, I do not know. Maybe she let me. 

Even now, when I’m all alone, I can still hear Her voice beckoning, calling me to go back, calling my name.",1,1770593136.0,creepypasta,3,1.0,False

I am planning on visiting in a few weeks to experience the neighborhoods first hand, but the last time I was there, I stayed in Court House, which I found to be a bit soulless for my liking.

I enjoy coffee shops, restaurants, and bars like anyone else, but I’m not a crazy nightlife person in terms of clubbing, etc. I’d like to be in an area with enough things to do to I meet people my age as this is a new city for me where I don’t know anybody.

1qzo6rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ifnotnowwhen/comments/1qzo6rr/why_do_some_women_sabotage_their_future/,Why do some women sabotage their future,"I'm on several dating apps and this is what I've noticed.  When I read a woman's narrative and she states what she's looking for and what is important to her in a man and a relationship, and, it resonates with me, I never hear back from them!  If they checked my profile they'd see how much we have in common, and they do check.  Yet I hear nothing, not even a why they're rejecting me.

If you're not pursuing what you say you want, then what are you pursuing?  The same you pursued in the past that obviously didn't work out for you?  Is it based on looks, religion, national origin, job, etc.?  Are you forgetting what Dr. King said about character, or don't you care about their character?

Yet, if a man turns you down because of your looks, your build, your boob size or waist size, your height, your education, etc., we're labeled cads, pigs, scum, etc.!  For me personally, if I reach out to you it's because I saw something special, someone I could relate to, someone worthy of my time and effort and hopefully not a cheater or gold-digger!  If you can't respect my effort, you're likely not someone who would respect me as a person.  So, if you think you're too good for me, all you did was save me a headache by letting me know what kind of character you possess.

I learned the hard way to respect myself way more than I used to.  The result has been a significant amount of female friends, most of which with partners.  The why includes my character and integrity and the trust they feel when they're with me or their significant other is.  I especially find it funny why so many women have a ""profile"" but there's little if anything in it and they expect you to respond to a 'like' or simple hello.  Then there are the ones with no picture or they're wearing sunglasses, or it's just a headshot and one picture.  That brings up two issues, why in heaven's name does the site allow profiles like that to be published in the first place.  And, if the woman is serious about starting a relationship why wouldn't she want to ""attract"" men to respond?  To my mind they're just trying scam the people they'll attract, and as for the site, they're also scamming us, especially when they ""match"" us to people who don't come close to our preferences.  

So, my advice is, save your money as NONE of the sites are worth the cost.  I've had a number of women just walk up to me in a coffee shop and engage me in conversation and offer up their phone number.  Ironically, they're married, which points to the nature of their relationship.  It's a life long partner I yearn for.  Depending on your definition of 'date', lots of those coffee shop encounters last over an hour! :-)
