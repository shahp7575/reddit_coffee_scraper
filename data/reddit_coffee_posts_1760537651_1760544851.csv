1o7fb7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmilieKiserUpdates/comments/1o7fb7y/we_are_grieving_too/,We are grieving too.,"She‚Äôs been talking about how grief works differently for everyone. Honestly, it sounds like a very ChatGPT coded, PR trained, and therapist approved kind of response.

She said she wants normalcy in her life and reminded everyone that we only see about 1% of it. The part she chooses to share. She explained that she is grieving, but privately, with her therapist, family, and friends. She doesn‚Äôt want to grieve publicly and believes we, as the audience, don‚Äôt have the right to demand how or when she should share that pain.

But I think what‚Äôs making people upset right now is that there‚Äôs no visible trace of grief. She doesn‚Äôt have to talk about the night it happened.She doesn‚Äôt have to address pool safety. She doesn‚Äôt have to talk about Brady. But maybe what we all want is just acknowledgment. Something small. A soft song playing over his toys. A video panning to one of his drawings. Show his empty bed. His suitcase. Even a quiet shot of the grass near his resting place. Something that lets us grieve too, that gives us a bit of closure so we can move forward and continue to support her.

Because with this whole weird parasocial relationship, we were all grieving with her when he passed. We supported her before it happened. We loved that little boy. We were there. Emotionally, at least. We are grieving too.

We are  not asking for another crying video or for her to sit down and process her thoughts‚Äî those should stay private. We just want a gentle acknowledgment, a moment to share in that loss.

Right now, the shopping vlogs and coffee runs feel jarring. Nothing feels ‚Äúyummy‚Äù anymore.

I read somewhere that she might have vlogged through those hospital days, and maybe there was even a video titled ‚ÄúThe Worst Night of My Life.‚Äù But perhaps we never saw it because‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt make 
it.

Ever since I met her I felt something I never have with anyone else and I know how she looked at me she felt the same. I‚Äôm 29 and she‚Äôs 22. I met her at a coffee shop 3 years ago and just knew I‚Äôd married her. 

Now we‚Äôve been married for four months, and she came home drunk and crying telling me she made the biggest mistake and I have to forgive her. I had never seen her like that, she had makeup smeared all over her face her dress was a mess. I‚Äôll never forget how she said it happened, she was drunk and got carried away. Her friends convinced her it‚Äôs worth it. 

Never once since I met her have we gone more than 2 hours without talking to her but the last 3 days have been silent. I still love her more then anything in the world. But when I think of how she came home with another man‚Äôs touch it makes me so angry I can‚Äôt look at her but I don‚Äôt think I can ever love someone as much as I love her. 

Would it be insane to try and work past this? Some part of me is just grateful she actually told me I believe her that it was only once at least. ",3,1760544653.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False

Also, I'd like to point out the pervy guy I was talking about seems to behave in the same way, but looks completely different to this guy Gabriel's picture. The guy I'm talking about is Jean, so  he's out there too somewhere in Cork.

I'll leave Gabriel's comment here because my original post is a few days old, and maybe nobody's looking at it anymore, so won't see his response.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This is Gabriel. I need to set the record straight. I‚Äôll be 100% honest about what‚Äôs been going on.

The person mentioned in comments who follows girls around after being told no is NOT ME. It is someone else entirely. I repeat, IT IS NOT ME.

It‚Äôs true that I do approach women to make new connections. It has led to some very rewarding relationships. But I am ALWAYS polite and if ever I am told she is not interested, I always say ‚ÄúNo problem. I hope you have a great day.‚Äù And then I leave IMMEDIATELY. I have NEVER, not even one time in my life, ever followed a girl. That is incredibly inappropriate disgusting behaviour.

About the incident at Victoria Mills knocking on the girl‚Äôs door, I‚Äôd like to give context. I was with 2 of my roommates and we wanted to get to know our neighbours. We have had people knock on our door as well to make new friends. That‚Äôs how I know plenty of people in the building at this point and we have had group dinners.

There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation on the internet and this is one example of it. It‚Äôs true that I am more outgoing than most. When I came to Ireland in 2018 I didn‚Äôt know a single person. I had to force myself to be outgoing. And because of that I‚Äôve made a lot of lifelong connections in Cork. But I was raised to be respectful of other people. I NEVER did any of the creepy stuff I‚Äôm being accused of. I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if I did. I know this is just words on a screen and it‚Äôs easy to just go with the crowd. But put yourself in my shoes, and imagine opening up Reddit and seeing yourself accused of horrific things that you didn‚Äôt do. Maybe we can all try to understand each other a little more.

1o7fa47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honor/comments/1o7fa47/honor_magic8_post_launch_executive_interview_ceo/,"Honor Magic8 Post Launch Executive Interview: CEO Li Jian and Team Discuss Robot Phone Vision, AI Strategy, and Imaging Breakthrough (Full Transcript)","Today after the Honor Magic8 press conference, there was an exclusive interview with 5 executives:

* CEO Li Jian
* Product Line President Fang Fei
* Liu Yang, President of Hardware Engineering Department
* IoT Head Lin Lin
* MagicOS President Sun Jianfa 

**1. How do you interpret the new situation? How are you starting a new game?**

**Li Jian:** The dream of Honor, starting from mobile phones, has three dimensions to open a new game.

First, the new game of mobile phones. We think the era of smartphones and AI Phones are one era, but there's another era‚Äîthe ROBOT Phone, which we've begun working on. Mobile phones won't have an inherent form. We hope to explore the future, and we've already opened at least two new directions.

Second, how to make AI become stronger and stronger to serve people and evolve itself‚Äîthe new game of self-evolution.

Third, the new game of future lifestyles and changes in how people may live in the future. For example, the AI button on Magic8 allows the phone to see everything. What YOYO sees, you can command it to do‚Äîthis is fundamentally a change in interaction methods.

People who buy Magic8 are choosing a new lifestyle, and we'll launch new features step by step in the future.

  


**2. Competitors have changed their strategies significantly. What's your view on the competition between large and super cup models?**

**Li Jian:** My feelings may not be entirely correct, but it doesn't matter what cup size it is‚Äîwhat matters is how much coffee is in the cup. If it's filled less, it means the name sounds good but the product isn't.

Facing consumers, we need to bring value to them with real substance. What it's called doesn't really matter.

For the company, the team must work hard. Many things aren't about what to say, but what to do. Many people don't know about our imaging capabilities, but they can be measured.

The third point is to be sincere and give the best things to customers, but you can't set the price too high.

Every product we make uses the best components possible‚Äînot only hardware but also AI. It's not a gimmick or a toy. It can help you get the most satisfactory results at the lowest price. How can you not like such AI?

  


**3. Today you launched a Robot Phone. What's the future evolution direction of AI terminals? What's the starting point for making a Robot Phone?**

**Li Jian:** The most important thing is starting from consumer needs‚Äîthis is our basic philosophy.

In the introduction before the launch, I talked about the concept of a troika. Our team hopes to organically combine care for people, release people's potential, and make people happier‚Äîand create such a product.

Robot Phones are based on the organic combination of AI mobile phones, robots, and imaging. They can bring work and life value as well as emotions. I think this is the trend of AI terminals in the future.

Honor's team will definitely be able to explore the future in the terminal field and demonstrate our value. Not only among Chinese manufacturers, but also leading globally. We'll move forward toward this goal.

  


**4. The Honor Magic8 series launched a 200MP Ultra Night Telephoto and AIMAGE imaging system. Facing fierce image competition in the industry, how can Honor reverse its imaging reputation and win this ""turnaround battle""?**

**Li Jian:** When I first took over, there was a lot of pressure regarding imaging.

First, looking at performance‚Äîobjectively speaking, Honor mobile phones are at least the most leading in terms of performance, not to mention crushing competitors.

Second, looking at imaging‚Äîthere was a lot of pressure when I first took over because everyone was indifferent to Honor's image quality. Not that it was bad, but this was our biggest pain point. Our image wasn't very prominent. Our team invested more than 1,000 people working day and night on imaging, and Liu Yang's team received full support. This result is something Honor has strategically invested in‚Äîthe culmination of our imaging strategy development to date.

I think our imaging can wrestle with any manufacturer in terms of basic experience. Everyone knows our style and will really compare. Our imaging department is also very dedicated. On this track, we're competing head-on.

Third, the AI track is specially handled by a team of 2,600 people‚ÄîSun Jianfa's team. YOYO, device-side models, cloud model matrix‚Äîthis is what Honor AI relies on. AI should be humble but not self-deprecating. We're the most advanced in the mobile phone field.

AI leading, imaging tied with the masters‚Äîin the near future everyone will definitely see us surpassing them. Performance is also Honor's specialty, as everyone can see. We start tuning from the bottom layer, which is our core competency.

In the past, everyone was indifferent to Honor's flagship phones. If this time people are still indifferent, we'll continue working hard. Three versions, two leading, one equal‚Äîthis should satisfy consumers.

  


**5. Today's flagship competition is very fierce. Netizens currently evaluate Magic8 as the most powerful standard version. How did you consider product positioning?**

**Fang Fei:** Comparing it closely, it is indeed the most powerful standard version, which is inseparable from our pursuit.

We've been launching many innovative experiences and technologies to maximize our product strength. Powerful is the background color of the Magic series‚Äîyou can't lose it. Don't just fill the cup; do a good job with the standard version. It should surpass other manufacturers' Pro models.

This is defined based on the original intention of uncompromising user experience: AI buttons, battery, battery life, chip tuning, subwoofer, eye protection screen, telephoto, etc.‚Äîall are very strong. The background color of the Magic series will never fade.

But this isn't necessarily enough. You should be able to see our change of thinking on Magic8. In addition to its strength, it also has a soul. AI and imaging are accelerating development‚Äîall functions that young people like, representing their way of life. There's also food and travel content, all close to young people's lives.

Regarding imaging, why focus on night performance? Because young people like activities at night. The Night God telephoto and AI color chasing we launched also reflect aesthetic appeals.

Today, the standard version being so strong is both by chance and inevitable. This is just a phenomenon. We hope to finally be loved by consumers and continue receiving all kinds of feedback.

  


**6. How does the product design phase define where AI is implemented? How do you avoid privacy risks?**

**Fang Fei:** The core value of the device side is the user's data‚Äîthe core asset and the difference between AI and traditional apps.

Additionally, the device side is low-cost and efficient, especially when there's a large amount of data in the future. We hope a closed loop can be achieved on the device side. Currently it's basic understanding and task distribution, but the future should be a combination of device-cloud collaboration. However, the value of the device side will become more and more prominent.

The device side and the user have a bound relationship, which can build a real digital world clone and become a partner who understands you.

There are still needs regarding power consumption, storage, operating efficiency, etc. There will be many changes in chip adaptation, storage, and model optimization, which will change qualitatively compared to traditional CPU approaches.

  


**7. The image upgrade of Magic8 is very significant, especially the 200MP Ultra Night Telephoto. What work have you done?**

**Liu Yang:** I believe everyone has been waiting a long time. The Honor imaging team can now compete with competitors in terms of size and capabilities.

Night scenes are a difficult scenario but also liked by consumers. Starting from this scene, in addition to introducing experts in China, we've also brought in many experts from overseas research institutes to achieve CIPA 5.5-stop stabilization. The main camera achieves the same. The standard version can also achieve CIPA level 5.

With this capability, the shot success rate has been greatly improved. The main camera can achieve 2-second handheld shooting.

Night portraits and stage portraits are similar, so we've also conquered stage portraits this time.

Additionally, we're conquering portraits by reconstructing the portrait engine and 3A algorithm, achieving portrait progress through AI model enhancements. Capture has also been upgraded to achieve continuous output of 30 frames of photos.

Imaging is also an end-to-end experience, with AI composition, AI color chasing, and other functions added.

Today we're competing with our competitors, believing we can surpass them and get first place in the future.

  


**8. In what areas has Honor made innovative breakthroughs to achieve the three peaks of imaging?**

**Liu Yang:** There are many innovations in AI large model optimization, 1-bit quantization, graphics engines, scene recognition, etc. AI accuracy will continue improving.

There has been great progress in imaging, system, and tuning. Regarding performance, we achieved 4.28 million points this time, but our temperature is also the lowest‚Äîthis demonstrates our capability. We've also implemented hardware solutions for many important consumer scenarios, such as defocus eye protection.

There's also communication performance‚Äîthe Pro series supports the n79 frequency band, which helps with network residency, power consumption, and speed. There's also display enhancement: 1080P SDR video can be upgraded to HDR 1000 level.

Up to 15 hours of comprehensive battery life is the pursuit of the Honor team. We'll continue working hard to bring more surprises.

**Li Jian:** Material grade‚Äîbattery, screen‚ÄîHonor's accumulation is very deep. Chip level communication field‚ÄîHonor has self-developed chips. In our professional field, our capabilities are very strong. On the SoC side, our tuning ability is very strong. The performance results are the tuning results of each module of the chip.

MagicOS also has unique understanding, along with model capabilities, device-side models, and cloud model combination capabilities. Honor is also very strong in these areas.

There's also our deep understanding of users‚Äîthe needs in all aspects and understanding of people. Honor has also made great progress here.

Products made on this basis can truly meet consumer needs, from the bottom layer to the user layer, with unique advantages.

  


**9. Today Honor released many AI functions. Honor defines AI mobile phones as a life form that grows together with users. How does YOYO achieve self-evolution? What are the essential differences from mainstream large models?**

**Sun Jianfa:** The level of YOYO assistants is often the ceiling of engineers when they leave the factory. Honor's AI logic is that when you get YOYO, its life has just begun. Starting from scratch, through intensive learning, self-competition, exploration, learning, and trial and error in unfamiliar fields, it achieves independent evolution. In three months, automatic execution capability grew 15 times‚Äîthis is the embodiment of this approach.

The greatest self-evolution must be done with the user.

  


**10. How did Honor launch the monthly renewal plan? There are many user opinions. How do you analyze its value?**

**Sun Jianfa:** Competition in the AI era is no longer about parameters but the pursuit of user experience. Monthly renewals are based on this. Honor attaches great importance to user feedback. Direct user participation gives the code a soul‚Äîthis is the driving force behind YOYO's evolution.

Honor positions users as evolutionary mentors for YOYO.

We and our users jointly decide YOYO's future‚Äîno longer unilaterally defined. We work with users to determine the next evolution direction. Opinions from the YOYO wishing pool will be adopted and immediately enter the monthly MagicOS update.

  


**11. The tablet released this time is half a year ahead of other manufacturers. What's the level of comparison with the Apple M5 iPad Pro? What are the other product plans?**

**Lin Lin:** First, the product manager has strong insight‚Äîconsumers need such a powerful tablet. Second, the R&D team is making mobile phones and tablets on the same platform simultaneously, with very large investment. Only Honor has achieved this.

Apple's new platform should come soon with strong performance. We're confident in comparison in some areas. You can't look at Apple only from chip difficulty‚Äîits ecological competitiveness is very strong. Honor is an open company. We're confident we'll work with industry partners to jointly maintain the Android ecosystem and compete with Apple.

From a full-scenario perspective, AI dividends on mobile phones first mean full-scenario business sharing. User data and usage habits can be smoothly transplanted to IoT products.

Full-scenario products still focus on all aspects of user life. We'll cover these scenarios well. You'll see Honor and Honor-selected products using computing power and trust rings to achieve a complete closed loop.

  


**12. What does the ultra-high chip utilization rate mean?**

**Liu Yang:** The entire scheduling ability of Qualcomm chips is like the difference between usable area and building area. We have a joint laboratory with Qualcomm for underlying performance scheduling‚Äînot only the chip itself but also storage and cache scheduling. Running scores use these capabilities, all strongly adapted to Qualcomm chips.

In addition to performance optimization and improvement, there's also monitoring and isolation of DDR bad blocks, resulting in fewer lags and protecting user data. Specific utilization rate can be seen from running score proportions‚Äîlower temperature, higher scores, even beyond a generation. This embodies chip capability mining.

Regarding GPU, real-time rendering of super-resolution and super-frame rate is also the pride of the Honor team.

**Fang Fei:** The super-resolution and super-frame algorithm uses NPU intervention. Many manufacturers may not be able to use it, but we can‚ÄîGPU and NPU collaborative algorithms, similar to DLSS, to achieve full mobilization of computing power, better than traditional solutions. So we say Honor has a higher ""room rate.""

The arrival of AI enables scenarios, computing power, and experience to have more in-depth optimization‚Äîfrom top to bottom, from hardware to software to hardware-software integration. There are our technologies at every level.

**Li Jian:** The joint laboratory with Qualcomm discusses how to design chips for future AI functions. We've reached very good cooperation with Qualcomm, with communication before chip design. It's possible that some of the ""rooms"" in the room rate are made for Honor. Honor is the manufacturer that understands chips best.

After design, regarding chip components‚ÄîI've worked on chips like MPC8260‚Äîhow to coordinate each module and component is the difference between a rough house and a hardcover house.

There's also a driver layer above the chip that needs to be optimized.

**Liu Yang:** For example, traditional frame insertion averages between two frames, while our frame insertion makes vector judgments, so latency is lower. The longer the usage time, the more accurate the judgment. So we can perform better and operate better.

  


**13. What's the layout of the Honor ALPHA flagship store and brand flagship stores?**

**Li Jian:** The news network has reported on this flagship store. The ALPHA flagship store has all kinds of AI and new forms, with very high traffic during this period.

Honor's vision is to combine technology and humanities, transforming from an intelligent terminal company to an AI terminal ecosystem. This store reflects the direction of our strategic transformation.

It has three positions: First, users can experience the future AI lifestyle. Second, we can develop the future AI ecosystem with users and creatives‚Äîwe have salons to exchange these ideas. Third, we have many partners who can showcase their achievements to demonstrate future AI scenarios: work, education, imaging, health, companionship‚Äîall kinds.

We hope to bring something different to the future of AI life with all companies.

The ALPHA store embodies this: to look at the future life, see Honor. Honor may be the only one among all terminal manufacturers currently doing this, and we'll gradually promote it worldwide.

Honor hopes to become an important contributor to global AI in the future.

**Fang Fei:** Next week on the 23rd, we'll also have a developer conference where intelligent hardware and ecosystem partners from north and south will come to the scene. Everyone can experience it together.

I was diagnosed with HH almost 2 years ago now, and I was put on PPIs but I am trying to wean off them and rely on diet lifestyle changes instead.

I have changed many things significantly (stopped drinking alcohol, coffee, smoking, stopped eating after 5 or 6, no spicy food etc.), but i still wake up every morning coughing up acid that sneaked up overnight.

I was working on a new project, my mind scattered with ideas but no clear path forward. The comforting hum of conversations around me and the clinking of coffee cups almost had a calming effect, though it was clear I wasn‚Äôt fully immersed in the moment.

Then, she walked in. A woman in her late twenties, with a worn leather bag slung over her shoulder and a book tucked under her arm. She seemed like someone who might be a regular, someone who knew exactly where to sit and how to order without looking at the menu. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention at first, just another passerby on a rainy afternoon.

But then, as fate would have it, she took the seat next to mine. No one else was in the small row of tables, so we shared a quiet, unspoken acknowledgment of each other‚Äôs presence. I was too focused on my laptop, but I couldn‚Äôt help but overhear her phone conversation. She was speaking in soft, measured tones, clearly frustrated but doing her best to maintain composure.

I know, I know. I‚Äôm trying, It‚Äôs just, everything is falling apart, she said, her voice trailing off. She paused, and I heard the faint sound of her sighing deeply. I could sense she was talking to someone close, perhaps a friend or a family member.

I wasn‚Äôt one to eavesdrop, but something in her words seemed to resonate with me. I understood the feeling of being overwhelmed by life‚Äôs unexpected challenges. Without thinking too much, I closed my laptop and glanced over at her.

Hey, I hope you don‚Äôt mind me saying this, but it sounds like you‚Äôre dealing with a lot right now, I said, my voice low but warm. If you need a distraction, I‚Äôm happy to chat for a bit. I‚Äôm just working on a project myself.

She looked up, slightly surprised, but gave a small smile. Thanks, that‚Äôs kind of you, she said, placing her phone down. Honestly, I think I could use a little distraction.

We started talking, just casual conversation at first. She told me about her job in marketing, how everything felt like it was spiraling out of control, and how she was struggling to find balance. I shared some of my own frustrations too, how starting something new can feel like you‚Äôre walking in a fog, unsure of what‚Äôs ahead.

We spoke for nearly an hour, the rain tapping against the windows as the world outside carried on. It wasn‚Äôt anything extraordinary, just two strangers in a caf√© sharing their experiences. But something about that simple exchange felt meaningful. It was the kind of conversation that reminded me that, no matter how isolated we might feel, there are always moments when we connect with others in ways we never expect.

When she stood up to leave, she looked at me with genuine appreciation. Thanks for the talk, she said, I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed it.

I watched her walk out into the rain, the sound of the door closing behind her signaling the end of our brief encounter. I went back to my laptop, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something had shifted within me. Sometimes, the simplest of conversations, those that start unexpectedly, can remind us that we‚Äôre all just trying to navigate the chaos of life, and that connection, however fleeting, can make all the difference.

It‚Äôs strange how life works, isn‚Äôt it? You never know when or where you‚Äôll meet someone who helps you put things into perspective. In a way, it reminded me that even in moments of overwhelm, we‚Äôre never truly alone. And sometimes, the best way to cope is to open up, even to a stranger.",1,1760544346.0,branding,0,1.0,False

It's human nature to desire crystal clear communication in life and particularly in romance.. but the cold reality is that this topic has been discussed to death on social media for years and \*nothing\* has changed. 

There is a pool of people who use their words to describe their romantic intent in honest, clear, and well-timed ways.   And that pool is so tiny it's close to zero. 

If that is your dating pool, you are going to be lonely forever or have such a massively restricted pool, you are almost certainly going to be unhappy with your potential partners in various aspects as there are too few people to be selective.

What is super effective in dating is this:

\* learn to read body language (nuance, subtle flirting, signals, signs, whatever you want to call it) and communicate effectively in it, along with general charm + social skills.  

Watching people here try to date without knowing body language is as cringe as watching Americans go to Paris and insist on speaking English.  You are trying to date using the wrong language.  The language of love is not words and logic.  It is body language and emotion.

The best ways to get skilled at this are make friends with socialites and hang out with them in social situations a lot and observe, as well as occasionally participate.  It's easy to do that by going to a variety of meetups and putting yourself out there, purely as friends.  Just 1 or 2 people can mentor you and level you up, and many socialites love to help teach their friends how to be social.

Also, enroll in things like amateur community theater + improv comedy.  Few people will do this due to insecurities but those introverts who do so will see their social skills and success at dating go up like 100x.   

\* find venues where fun things are going on and your types of singles are present in large numbers.  Mingle and make friends.  Very gradually, start to flirt more and more over time.   This improves your social status and gets you in front of lots of potential dates who you can vet.

\* therapy to improve your confidence and get over various anxieties, such as fear of rejection, fear of approaching / social anxiety etc

\* cold approach at places like grocery stores and coffee shops, but mostly bars and clubs.  You don't have to drink alcohol at bars and clubs.  A few people will be turned off but the vast majority either don't care or see it as you being responsible which is a plus to those looking for LTR.

I'm probably missing a lot but those will get things moving in the right direction :)  good luck out there!

I lost my 16 month old son to cancer in May. Went back to work in July (not by choice, I maxed out all of my PTO & FMLA in the months caring for him).

Since then, of course every day is painful, but the mornings are atrocious. It‚Äôs gotten particularly bad this month.  I work in higher Ed & the fall semester is horrible. October is crunch time & I spend so much goddamn time working. 

And I don‚Äôt want to! Work was the most important thing in my life until my son came along, & that shift in priorities was so lovely & freeing. I would set myself on fire for my son, but I won‚Äôt do it for work anymore. 

I‚Äôm doing all the right things. I‚Äôm on antidepressants, seeing a therapist, going to a grief support group, exercising. Still, the mornings are absolute shit. I wake up, remember that my son, who was deeply wanted & loved after several miscarriages, is dead & I‚Äôll never see him again. It knocks the wind out of me & I‚Äôm pinned to the bed with pain. I force myself to get up & get ready for work, & I mean force. I like yoga & coffee & try to use those as incentives, but in the end, the only incentive that kicks me out of bed is not losing my job. 

My days off are hard as well, but I typically have plans that get me moving easier (brunch, hiking, etc). 

Weekday mornings are so agonizing that I honestly don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take. I don‚Äôt think a job change would help‚Äîthis is the best job I‚Äôve ever had, but without my son, I just can‚Äôt find the joy or motivation.  I‚Äôm not contemplating suicide, but I fantasize about it a lot.  I just want to sleep forever.  I just want to stop forcing my broken psyche to do things it‚Äôs not ready to.

1o7f231,https://i.redd.it/843uzpuetavf1.jpeg,Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects Review ‚Äì Brighten Your Smile from Home,"Look, I get it. You're scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone with these ridiculously white smiles, and you're wondering if your coffee-and-wine-stained teeth will ever match up. Professional teeth whitening costs a fortune, and you're not exactly thrilled about spending $500+ at the dentist. Enter **Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects**‚Äîthe at home teeth whitening solution that actually delivers results without destroying your bank account.

I've tested these strips myself, and spoiler alert: they work. But are they perfect? Let's talk about it.

## What Makes Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects Different?

Here's the thing about teeth whitening strips‚Äîthey're not all created equal. The market's flooded with cheap knockoffs that promise Hollywood smiles but deliver disappointment. **Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects** stand out because they use the same whitening ingredient dentists use: hydrogen peroxide.

The Professional Effects version packs a solid punch with its formulation. You're looking at professional-level whitening that removes up to 14 years of stains. Yeah, you read that right. Fourteen years. That's basically every latte you've ever enjoyed coming off your teeth.

### The Science Behind The Strips

Want to know why these actually work? The strips use **advanced seal technology** that molds to your teeth shape. This isn't some flimsy piece of plastic that slides around your mouth while you're trying to answer a Zoom call (trust me, I've been there :/).

The hydrogen peroxide penetrates enamel stains, breaking down discoloration at the molecular level. Fancy science talk aside, it means the whitening agent actually reaches the stains instead of just sitting on the surface doing nothing.

[Check out Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects here](https://amzn.to/4qjx4DF)

## My Honest Experience: The Good, The Bad, and The Sensitive

Let me walk you through what actually happens when you commit to the full treatment. And yes, I said commit‚Äîbecause this isn't a one-and-done situation.

### The Application Process

Applying these strips is straightforward. You peel, press, and go about your business for 30 minutes. The strips stick surprisingly well, though talking feels weird at first. I looked like I was trying to communicate through clenched teeth for the first few days.

Here's what you need to know about the routine:

- **Treatment duration**: 30 minutes per day
- **Total treatment period**: 20 days
- **Results visibility**: Around day 3-4
- **Full results**: By day 20

The strips don't slide around, which is huge. Nothing's worse than teeth whitening strips that decide to take a field trip around your mouth mid-treatment.

### Real Talk About Sensitivity

Let's address the elephant in the room: **sensitivity**. If you've got teeth that already protest when you drink cold water, you need to know this upfront. Some people experience zero sensitivity. Others (like me) feel it.

Around day 5, my teeth started feeling a bit zingy. Not unbearable, but noticeable. I switched to sensitivity toothpaste, and that helped tremendously. The sensitivity faded completely within a week after finishing the treatment.

FYI, if you're worried about teeth whitening for sensitive teeth, you might want to try the Crest 3D White Glamorous White version first‚Äîit's gentler but takes longer to show results.

## Results: Does This Actually Work?

Short answer? Yes. Long answer? Also yes, but let me elaborate.

By day 3, I noticed my teeth looked brighter. Not dramatically different, but definitely cleaner-looking. By day 10, people started commenting. By day 20, I was genuinely impressed with the teeth whitening before and after comparison.

### What You Can Realistically Expect

The packaging claims results comparable to a $500 professional whitening treatment. I'd say that's about 80% accurate. You're not going to get Ross-from-Friends-glow-in-the-dark white, but you'll definitely see several shades of improvement.

The strips work best on:

- Coffee and tea stains
- Wine discoloration
- Natural yellowing from aging
- Tobacco stains (though quitting is obviously better)

They're less effective on:

- Intrinsic stains (inside the tooth)
- Gray discoloration from certain medications
- Damage from excessive fluoride exposure

## Comparing Crest Whitestrips To Other Options

Ever wondered why Crest dominates the teeth whitening kit market? It's because they've actually invested in research and development. I've tried drugstore knockoffs, and honestly, save your money.

### Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects vs. Professional Whitening

**Professional whitening** costs $300-$800, takes one visit, and delivers slightly better results. **Crest Whitestrips** cost around $45, require 20 days, and get you 85-90% of those results. You do the math.

The convenience factor matters too. I whitened my teeth while binge-watching shows, answering emails, and doing laundry. Can't exactly multitask in a dentist's chair.

[Grab your Crest 3D Whitestrips here](https://amzn.to/4qjx4DF)

### Crest Professional Effects vs. Other Crest Variants

Crest makes several whitestrips versions, which gets confusing fast. Here's the breakdown:

**Professional Effects**: The sweet spot. Strong enough for serious whitening, gentle enough for most people. 20-day treatment.

**Glamorous White**: Gentler formula, better for sensitive teeth. Takes 28 days but causes less discomfort.

**1 Hour Express**: Fast results but more sensitivity. Good for special events but not ideal for first-timers.

IMO, Professional Effects offers the best balance between effectiveness and tolerability for most people.

## Tips For Maximum Results (That Nobody Tells You)

Want to get the most out of your best teeth whitening strips? Here's what I learned through trial and error:

### Before Treatment

**Brush your teeth** before applying strips, but wait 30 minutes. Applying strips immediately after brushing can increase sensitivity. Your gums need a minute to chill out.

**Avoid staining foods** for 48 hours before starting. You want a clean slate for the whitening agent to work on.

### During Treatment

Keep these strips away from your gums. Seriously. The whitening gel can irritate gum tissue, causing temporary discomfort. I learned this the hard way on day 2.

**Don't eat or drink** during the 30-minute treatment. I know that sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how tempting it is to sip water when your mouth feels dry.

Set a timer. Leaving strips on longer doesn't give you better results‚Äîit just increases sensitivity risk.

### After Treatment

Wait at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything. Your enamel is temporarily more porous after whitening, making it more susceptible to staining.

Avoid these staining culprits for the first hour after treatment:

- Coffee (I know, tragic)
- Red wine
- Dark sodas
- Berries
- Tomato-based sauces

## Maintenance: Keeping Your Smile Bright

You've invested 20 days into professional teeth whitening at home. Now what? Your teeth will gradually restain over time‚Äîthat's just reality. But you can definitely slow the process.

I do a single whitening session once a month now. One strip, 30 minutes, done. This maintains my results without starting the full treatment again.

Some people swear by whitening toothpaste for maintenance. It helps, but don't expect miracles. Whitening toothpaste removes surface stains; it doesn't actually whiten teeth the way hydrogen peroxide does.

## Safety Concerns: Are Crest Whitestrips Safe?

This is a legitimate question, and I appreciate you asking. **Are Crest Whitestrips safe?** The short answer is yes, when used as directed.

The American Dental Association has given Crest Whitestrips their Seal of Acceptance. That's not a participation trophy‚Äîit means the product has been rigorously tested and proven both safe and effective.

### Potential Side Effects

The most common side effect is temporary tooth sensitivity. This affects about 60% of users to some degree. For most people, it's mild and manageable.

Gum irritation can occur if the strips touch your gums consistently. This usually resolves quickly after treatment ends.

### Who Shouldn't Use Them

Skip these strips if you:

- Have cavities or dental work that needs attention
- Are pregnant or nursing (just to be safe)
- Have gum disease or very sensitive teeth
- Are under 18 (enamel is still developing)

When in doubt, check with your dentist. They won't judge you for wanting teeth whitening without sensitivity issues‚Äîthey get it.

## The Verdict: Worth Your Money?

After testing Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects extensively, I can confidently say they deliver on their promises. You're getting legitimate results for a fraction of professional whitening costs.

Are they perfect? No. The sensitivity issue is real for some people, and 20 days requires commitment. But if you want noticeably whiter teeth without dropping $500 at the dentist, these strips are your best bet.

The results last several months with proper maintenance, making the $45 investment pretty reasonable. Compare that to professional whitening that costs 10x more, and the value becomes obvious.

## Final Thoughts

Listen, I'm not going to tell you that Crest Whitestrips will change your life. But they'll definitely change your smile, and sometimes that confidence boost is exactly what you need.

I use these strips before big events, job interviews, or anytime I need that extra polish. They're convenient, effective, and won't require a loan. What's not to love?

If you've been sitting on the fence about teeth whitening, wondering if at home options actually work‚Äîthey do. **Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects** prove that professional-level whitening doesn't require a professional setting.

Your coffee habit doesn't have to show on your teeth anymore. Just saying :)

I had a mini (as in many months) hiatus, which then gave me the motivation to push and follow through with the coffee brewing app. I went through the process and [BeanBean is now available on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beanbean.beanbean), here are some hurdles I wish I knew before getting into the final part of production with the Google Play Console.

1. **Upgrade to the latest Godot.** When I was dealing with Google Play Billing Library, the code you need to use to connect to Google's billing services to take in-app and subscription services, I was hitting my head against the wall for days trying to make it work. It was only after updating to 4.5 that I managed to request information from their servers... To be honest, I expected 4.4 to not have any issues with this but learning more about Google Play Billing and how it updates constantly, from my understanding it needed Android SDK 35 to work and the workaround by just inputting 35 in the SDK export field and run it as experimental just didn't cut it anymore.
2. **If it's your first rodeo, don't set a hard release date.** Once you are going through Google Play's requirements, new accounts now need to have 12 testers for 14 days opted into your closed testing build. So that is 14 days at the bare minimum. Now consider setting up your Play Store with screenshots, video, logo, summary and so on. If you have only focused on your app/game up until this point, it is time to shift gears and start polishing the release of your game/app. Also, each time you want to upload a new build to the Google Play Console, the whole upload and review process takes like 30min. This means that testing a small change you made takes much longer with the review process they have. So add at least 30 days or so for the process of getting it on the Google Play Store.
3. **Release Tracks on Google Play Console are mini divas.** They cannot be deleted, need to have unique version numbers, have to be .AAB, have many different types (internal, open, closed, publishing) and none of it feels intuitive. What I did was to use the Closed track for the friends and fam playtesters to reach my 14 day goal with 12 testers, then went straight to a production track once I was approved.
4. **USB Debugging exists.** When I was debugging the Google Play Billing, the way you can see your debug statements is through USB Debugging with Android Studio and LogCat. This is just like the debugger in Godot but it shows you everything your phone is encountering, including the print debug statements that you make. 
5. **Solidify your monetization model.** If you set your app as paid (as in people pay to download your app), you cannot convert it to free afterwards and vice versa. This is something that you choose super early in the Google Play Console process. If you decide to change, you will have to setup a whole new app and do the 14 day play testing requirement again. I decided to go with a freemium version with no ads that locked a few features behind a yearly subscription paywall. So this would be a free app with subscriptions added via the Google Play Billing Library.
6. **Learn about version numbering.** Right now BeanBean is officially 1.0.0 with the release. Whenever I make a small tweak or fix, it goes to 1.0.1. If I make a big feature addition, it becomes 1.1.1. When I have a critical amount of changes and features that make the app very different from its 1.0.0. release, I will make that version 2.0.0. and start the whole process again. There is no set way of doing version numbering, just find a way that works for you and conveys the changes you make to the public.
7. **Release it once MVP has been reached.** I keep on seeing mini changes, tweaks, blips and optimizations that I could be making. Creating a list of essential fixes to make the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) work and then tweaking it as I go after a publishing release is really how I want to develop moving forward. I wish I had published it perhaps a month or so ago where everything mostly worked. What I ended up doing was revamping a big chunk of the graphics, added more features and improved on the app. If I had released what I had a month ago and done these changes with a few updates here and there to make it perhaps something like 1.1.5 over time, then the users would see how much work has been done and improved on. The added benefit of getting feedback from the public and people you don't know is massive too and I am now excited for that stage of the app!

Super glad to have made it this far with Godot and I now totally want to try and make a smaller game with all the knowledge that I have in my noggin. Down the road, I probably want to learn something like Flutter or React Native just because many of my ideas are apps and not games. Godot is amazing to curate a unique game experience but where I see it falling short for my app idea needs is when I want to have things like frameworks and integration of social media and databases, native phone UI and seamless cross platform development.

Now with what I just said, there was a point in my BeanBean journey where I was 90% done and wanted to drop everything Godot and learn React Native / Flutter... I resisted that temptation and pushed through with my current tool (Godot) and I am glad that I did just that! What I took away from that is that there are always better tools for the job but if you have a tool that works for you right now, use it to get a finished product out. Then you can consider other tools if you really want to when beginning a new project now with a proper and complete understanding of the development and production process.

Good luck with all of your dev adventures. I am super happy with what I have learned up to this point and my mind is already churning a lot of other game/app ideas that I want to create!

1o7eze9,https://i.redd.it/3t2fzmn1tavf1.jpeg,Banks without overdraft fees: how is that possible?,"Overdraft fees can cost you a pretty penny. For example, a $5 cup of coffee could easily end up costing you $30+ if you get charged for being in the red. According to the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/comparing-overdraft-fees-and-policies-across-banks/) (CFPB), Americans usually pay billions per year in overdraft fees‚Äîabout $15B in 2019.^(1) Yikes! That‚Äôs why more people are turning to banks without overdraft fees or overdraft protection apps that spot you cash when you need it.

But here‚Äôs the real question: How can banks avoid charging you with overdraft fees? Let‚Äôs dig in.

# What exactly are overdraft fees?

Overdraft fees are charges that banks give you if you spend more money than what‚Äôs available in your account. For example, if you have $10 in your account and buy a $12 sandwich, your bank would fill the $2 gap instead of declining the purchase. However, they‚Äôd also charge you an overdraft fee up to $35 for covering the tab.¬†

# How do banks avoid overdraft fees?

Thankfully, there are many banks (and banking apps) that have stopped charging members for overspending. It‚Äôs now easier to find checking accounts with no overdraft fees. Here‚Äôs how they usually work:

* **They decline purchases**. Instead of letting the charge go through, these banks will stop a payment if there‚Äôs not enough money in your account.
* **Or they pull from your savings**. If you‚Äôre short, they‚Äôll withdraw money from your connected savings account to cover the gap. But heads up, it sometimes comes with a transfer fee.

# How Dave can help

You work hard for your money and shouldn‚Äôt lose it to $35 overdraft fees. If you find your bank account getting close to $0, you could fill it back up with ExtraCash¬Æ for less. You could qualify for up to $500 in 5 min or less.^(2) There‚Äôs no credit check, interest, or late fees. Download the Dave app and see how much you qualify for.

**DRUGS**

Let‚Äôs start with the cycle since that‚Äôs all anyone ever gives a shit about nowadays:

Offseason: 315/525 Test/DHT deriv (first half was with Primo, 2nd with Mast), 4 IUs GH.

Prep start: 210/210 Test/Mast, 4 IU GH (GH won‚Äôt change till pulled at the end).

Prep really start: 315/700 Test/Mast. From here, small escalations, small additions, all seen on the spreadsheet.

Prep end: 350/825/75 Test/Mast/Tren, 50 mg Winny.

I do well with high Mast, and this low Tren dose was perfect. Did its job, didn‚Äôt fuck me up much at all, 0 complaints. Winny at the end cuz Winny is awesome when that lean. GH 4 IUs was my dose the entire off-season, just was never given adjustments till it was time to pull it. All injectables were pulled Weds before the 1st show, I reintroduced them the day after show 1, and pulled again after Weds.

Honestly, nothing crazy here IMO. Some people might not handle the high Mast, low Test thing, but I do extremely well. But this is a pretty typical prep stack. Only 1 oral this time, coach wanted me to use Var but I have a lot of Winny on hand, so went with that instead, which he was ok with. I had Proviron on hand but didn‚Äôt bother, just didn‚Äôt really see a point at this time. So yeah, boring stuff, simple stack, not crazy doses. Guess Mast is a lil high and yeah in the current environment, really depleted my stock, but that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs there for. Still though, Mast is my fav drug. Any questions on these things, ask away.

[Bloodwork 5.5 Weeks Out](https://imgur.com/a/0bEO1rO)

Honestly, this is some of the best my bloodwork‚Äôs ever looked, give or take a couple numbers. For 5.5 weeks out on all the drugs I was on, I‚Äôll take it. Part of the game of risk we play. I regularly see a cardiologist and a nephrologist; both have given me green lights that things are ok after multiple testing. Just gotta keep monitoring and staying on top of things.

---

**DIET**

Preworkout: See supplements section of the sheet. I train ""fasted"" (I use EAAs in my pre).

Meal 1: Coffee, eggs, 250 g egg whites, oats, banana or blueberries, PB, spinach.

Meal 2: 170 g chicken, rice, veggies, English muffin.

Meal 3: 170 g chicken, rice, veggies, English muffin.

Meal 4: Oats, blueberries, almond butter, whey for training day; Greek yogurt, whey, almond butter NTD.

Meal 5: 1 salmon patty, 100 g beef, rice, veggies.

This is my baseline diet, and obviously things reduced or were removed throughout the prep. Meat weights listed cuz those never changed. Veggies are whatever frozen summer/seasonal mix is at Costco‚Äîpretty much always a blend of peppers, onions, maybe some squash or zucchini or asparagus, Brussels sprouts, etc. Never broccoli mixes. Pretty typical removals/reductions throughout prep: cut the muffins, cut down on the rice and oats, removed the eggs. Near the end it was like 1 rice meal and the rest were meat/veg, and then finally pulled all fats out.

During the entire duration of prep, I was given 0 (yes, zero) refeeds, cheats, or high days or whatever you want to call it. I won‚Äôt lie to you, this mentally fucked me up a lot by the end. Extremely frustrating constantly hearing everyone else get them and never getting one myself. I get it, but at the same time it was mentally really taxing and probably did me more harm than good. I also have a wife and 2 kids (7 yo and 1 yo), and I am the only one who trains or diets in the family. The amount of complete junk in the house is unreal, and they love McDonald‚Äôs but none of them ever‚Äîand I mean ever‚Äîfinish their food. I already dislike people wasting food, but doing it in front of me near the end of prep was breaking. I won‚Äôt pretend I‚Äôm some hardcore dude and never ate their shit; I did it often, and it definitely cost me my conditioning at the end. Maybe this shit wasn‚Äôt for me in this situation, but c‚Äôest la vie. You guys know me‚ÄîI‚Äôm transparent about that stuff. Prep isn‚Äôt easy, and I put myself in a bad spot constantly and broke many times. However, at the end of the day it was my choice to eat the food so no one else is to blame. We accept it happened, and we learn and try to do better next time. You‚Äôd be shocked how delicious some of those baby snacks are when you‚Äôre starving though.

---

**TRAINING**

Pretty simple stuff. My entire off-season and prep was 2 on 1 off PPL‚Äîchest-focused push, lat-focused pull, quad-focused legs, shoulder-focused push, upper-back-sorta-focused pull, hamstring/glute-focused legs. I never used intensifiers; it was strictly straight sets the entire time. The goal is to execute each rep properly and slowly build up a rep till I hit the top threshold and add weight and start again. If at any point I felt like I was executing poorly due to the weight jumping too much, I‚Äôd back off slightly and build back up properly. I used the same movements and machines the entire off-season and prep as well. Each set taken to 0-1 rep in the tank. I very, very rarely failed a rep, but it did happen a few times throughout the year. IMO, you should almost never be failing a rep, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Volume was the exact same from start till about halfway through prep when we got a reduction. As you can see, my training was just very simple and consistent, nothing else. I really, really enjoyed training this way‚Äîsimplicity focused on the things that matter: proper execution and progression.

**I think it is VERY important to note: I ended prep as strong or stronger than I started it. Training performance was maintained or improved throughout the entire time until like 2 weeks out just about, where I got slightly weaker but was still stronger than I had started prep.**

Prep volume:

Chest 11 (4 upper)  
Back 16 (10 lat focus, 6 upper back)  
Delts 6 lateral, 9 rear, 2 front = 17 total  
Bis 10  
Tris 8  
Quads 7 (1 is split squat, so pseudo glute work too)  
Hams 8 (+ 2 glutes)  
Adductors 5 (I skipped these like 75% of the time probably. Not because I‚Äôm lazy, but because mine are huge and grow like weeds just doing basic leg press and hack squat etc. I think people who don‚Äôt have adductors like that should be doing them religiously if they want big legs.)  
Calves 6  

88 total sets if you count adductors, and this is a 9-day split as it‚Äôs 2 on 1 off.

My off-season training‚Äîyou can add like 2 sets to the major body parts, maybe 1 to the minor ones. If anyone‚Äôs interested in the actual lifts chosen, just ask and I‚Äôd happily list ‚Äôem out.

Cardio ramped from 5√ó30 to 7√ó60 by the end, 12k steps throughout the whole time. Couple times we pulled back, dropped cardio for a few days, pulled steps back to 8-10k. Honestly, I get the thought process; didn‚Äôt feel like it helped fucking much at all. I‚Äôd rather have just done the fucking cardio and had some food.

**SUPPLEMENTS, ANCILLARIES, FAT BURNERS, PEPTIDES**

I‚Äôll start with supplements and ancillaries as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre like what the fuck if you saw it in my spreadsheet.

Preworkout stuff is pretty benign if you ask me‚Äîtypical preworkout stuff, some hydration, glutamine for gut health since I take the pre upon wake. 15 g EAAs is really important for me since I am waking up and immediately going to train. Need those aminos to help from the fasting. People who don‚Äôt train that early absolutely don‚Äôt need them, but those of us who do, I‚Äôd say this is almost required. Rest days I swap out the GPC for CDP Choline since it works slightly differently but covers my choline. Later on added IP6 as it needs to be taken fasted. This is used to help keep RBC count down, and I have always, since forever, had a very strong RBC count, so I have to constantly work on it.

Morning supplements post meal 1: Ezetimibe for lipids (works fucking wonders, brought my total down like 100 points and my LDL down like 70 points), Telmi for a large host of reasons, Astragalus for kidneys, NAC for everything, Natto for RBCs, CoQ10 for heart (an absolute staple for everyone), fish oil (1.6 g EPA/DHA total). Later added some extra magnesium, added Citrus Berg for lipids, tried out Astragaloside IV (meh), and way later added Ashwa KSM-66 post-training to help relax.

PM supplements pre-bed: Nebiv (I have always had a high RHR), Metformin, Hawthorn berry (possible heart help, cheap AF), Taurine, Magnesium, Curcumin (very good supplement, ask Jordan Peters. Make sure to get patented stuff‚ÄîLife Extension Super Bio is what I use. Make sure it has the ingredient BCM-95 for the Curcumin), more Astragalus, same fish oil again, lil Cialis once in a while. Later added more NAC, bumped up a couple things, and when sleep got shit later added in Ashwa, 5-HTP, P5P, L-Theanine.

Excessive? Yeah, most likely, but considering I was in prep and I kinda enjoy the whole supplement game, I liked my choices. I have a specific reason why I took each and every thing as it‚Äôs all tailored to my own needs‚Äîas your own stack should reflect that.

Fat burners and peptides: Clen, Reta, and MOTS-C.

I utilized Reta at 2 mg for almost the entire duration of the prep starting 14 weeks out. Honestly I should‚Äôve bumped the dose later in prep but was being stubborn, and coach most likely forgot I was even on it, so no guidance there. Drug is fantastic, worked extremely well until I got really deep into it, at which point I really should‚Äôve increased the dose. Bumping it up at the very end was sorta a too-little-too-late move when I finally realized how stupid I was being. It honestly became almost near ineffective towards the end; I was just so constantly starving and could think of nothing but food all day long. Lessons learned on how to utilize it better in the future.

Clen is something I handle really well side-effect wise outside of the expected increased RHR. No shakes, no anxiety, no sleeplessness, etc. I think the Clen fear-mongering is overblown, as I have spoken on this many times with multiple studies referenced, but I understand not everyone feels that way and that‚Äôs fine. Clen is something I really don‚Äôt have an issue using. However, in the future, I‚Äôm really expecting to be using a significantly lower dose and utilizing other compounds in its place, such as SLU and the other stuff floating around you see in people‚Äôs ‚Äúmito stacks‚Äù and such. Won‚Äôt really go into these as I haven‚Äôt used ‚Äôem, so can‚Äôt speak for it publicly.

Near the end, I got my hands on some MOTS-C, and wow was it a game changer on my energy levels. Training no longer was fucking beyond miserable, cardio wasn‚Äôt horrible, daily energy went up, RHR went down, and no longer felt like I had to drag. Was extremely impressed with this peptide‚Äîabsolutely utilizing this more going forward.

**PICS AND VIDS**

Ok yeah yeah finally we got the drugs, this is the only other thing we cared about, right? I‚Äôll share a side-by-side of some poses of the 1st show and 2nd show for you guys so you can compare pretty easily. I took 2nd in my class in both shows. The 1st show I lost to the overall winner. He looked very, very good; was very ok with that. The 2nd show honestly thought I had the class win, but such is life.

For show 1, I felt like I was really underfed, and honestly the way water was manipulated didn‚Äôt feel right. I woke up for the show feeling kinda flat and watery. I peed 0 times the night before the show when I typically go 2‚Äì4 times a night. Really felt like the mark was missed there. I gave coach feedback on Monday about how I felt, and how I wanted to experiment for show 2‚Äîmaybe try some manipulation, try to dry out more, etc., as I care more about learning and experimenting than just repeating this for another simple local show. Was told in order to be dry I have to be fat-free and fatigue-free. That was the end of the convo. So for the 2nd show, I had the help of some very good friends give me guidance. I drank 6 L water early in the week and bumped it to 7.5 L throughout the rest. For reference, I was drinking 4.5 L for show 1, bumped to 5 L Thurs, down to 3 L Fri. For show 1, I probably had 200 ish carbs on Thurs/Fri. For show 2, I had about 500 ish Thurs, 500 ish Fri. For show 1, no AI was used. For show 2, I took a good amount of Asin. End result was actually a lighter weight on stage, but bigger and harder (extremely noticeable in the side leg). Very happy with the end result.

**POST-SHOW THOUGHTS, LESSONS LEARNED, MOVING FORWARD**

Skip this if you don‚Äôt wanna hear sob stories or rants.

For starters: After show 1 I went to a burger joint called Black Tap. Had a nice Wagyu burger and 2 orders of sweet potato fries. Was going to have a crazy shake but my daughter hardly had her Nutella shake so I drank that instead. Had some of the other foods on the table that people didn‚Äôt finish; it was a great time with friends. Dessert, oh man. I was craving some ice cream, but not a whole lot. I also really like to try new things and I love this place cuz it always has changing really, really strange flavors. Went to Salt & Straw, got 1 scoop of the Apple Cider Donut ice cream (absolutely amazing) and 1 scoop of the Apple and Cheddar (yes, cheddar) Cinnamon Roll flavor. When you take a bite, at first it‚Äôs ok, but when you swallow it the literal only flavor in my mouth was cheddar. Not pleasant for ice cream. Still, fun times. Woke up the next morning to coach telling me to message him when I woke so he could start my rebound plan. Lemme tell you, internally I was pretty fucking upset. Multiple convos with him about how I‚Äôm doing back-to-back shows, and he told me he didn‚Äôt have that written down... It was bad enough that about 3 weeks out I felt like he kinda stopped giving a shit about me (based off just my own perception of feedback I was getting; can‚Äôt speak beyond that as maybe it‚Äôs just in my head), and now here I am realizing he didn‚Äôt even bother writing down my show plans. Whatever‚Äîwork to do to get the food off. Waited till Monday to see if he would message me about chatting about the show and peak. Nope, so that‚Äôs when I messaged him. Got pretty much no feedback at all except I‚Äôm not fat-free and had to do cardio near the end cuz I binged 10 days out (tons of donuts, some McDonald‚Äôs. Yeah, fuck.) so I‚Äôm fatigued. No other real discussion about anything, and I‚Äôve already been feeling pretty shitty about things so yeah, kinda where I just said fuck this. Post-show 2, Cheesecake Factory tradition. Had another burger and sweet potato fries, appetizers, slice of cheesecake. Felt good to finally relax my mind and let it all go.

My relationship with food by the end was fucking horrendous. Probably had 3 binges in total over the last 3 ish weeks. Couldn‚Äôt stand hearing people constantly getting refeeds, everyone eating in front of me anything they wanted all the time, IG feed full of shit, even people‚Äôs stories was them posting food all the time. I distinctly remember seeing wet dog food and my instant first thought was ‚Äúfuck that looks delicious I want a bite‚Äù and my immediate next thought was ‚Äúholy fuck dude fuck this forever.‚Äù Still working a tad bit on the relationship with food‚Äîhard but getting better. I think a big thing immediately post-show was just wanting to feel full. Was so sick of constant hunger, and when I was given my rebound plan of 2300 cals on rest day I was just immediately like yeah fuck this, and I‚Äôve been just slamming a ton of food. Is this best for a rebound? Fuck no. But after that first week post-show, everything in my life got better. Training, energy, sleep, relationship with wife and kids, my mental health‚Äîall things were significantly improved except diet, which I was very happy to trade off. I‚Äôve stabilized a lot now a couple weeks post, and am currently just enjoying my life, training hard, and cruising along not really being concerned about being a BBr and taking a mental break. Still eating like a BBr for 4 out of 5 meals a day, but I need the flexibility right now. Coach didn‚Äôt assign any cheat meals or free meals during the off-season, so I‚Äôve been kinda mentally on for a long time. Also when I‚Äôm not assigned any off-plan meals, it makes me feel guilty having one. That‚Äôs pretty much the beginning of the hard food relationship, which I‚Äôm now letting myself fix. Prep‚Äôs a fucking wild thing‚Äîdefinitely something I was so extremely over and never wanting to do again, to being like yeah maybe again one day down the road.

I left the first show immediately after I got my medal, so I‚Äôm still waiting on feedback from the pics I sent in. However, the 2nd show, I wanted to hear it from the judges then and there, so I waited around. The first thing the judge immediately told me made me realize how important it was to get live feedback because I would have never gotten this from pics. He told me I need to watch my stomach in transitions and make sure I don‚Äôt breathe into it (which I KNOW I do constantly; it‚Äôs a terrible, terrible BBing habit that I‚Äôve been conscious of but man stage time is just such a flurry I must‚Äôve relaxed it at some point and forgot). Told me to practice breathing up, and if I get in front of Steve or Sandy (national head judges) and make this mistake again I might as well walk off stage cuz I am going to stop being looked at. Secondly, he tried to have me change my side chest, but decided that it was fine overall. Lastly, the most obvious one to me, was conditioning. Talked about how guys just come in tighter and tighter every year and I just need to be more undeniable in my conditioning. Very, very fair critique and figured that was it. Especially noticeable when we had Pro Classic division and Andy P was peeled out of his mind. Also told me it wasn‚Äôt any one body part that cost me anything, so just focus on conditioning more. Feedback taken for the future.

Moving forward: Split change and going to be focusing on bringing up chest and upper back. Doing push chest-focused, pull lat-focused, legs quad-focused, rest, push shoulder-focused, hams and back, rest. Increased frequency for this off-season. Right now just eating how I feel, which is mostly clean now, but going to give myself more freedom for a bit. I don‚Äôt think I plan on competing in 2026, as I want to gain about 7‚Äì10 lbs of muscle before I step on stage again. After getting that 2nd 2nd place, I was really disappointed. Had a lot of people saying it was 50/50, 60/40 my favor, lot of people telling me I edged him out. However, after it settled in, I realized how that was probably the best thing for me. That pain of losing‚Äîthat is something that‚Äôll drive me extremely hard for the next prep. Winning would‚Äôve taught me nothing as I would‚Äôve thought I did everything right. Losing though is a very big motivator for me. Just gotta turn the anger and frustration into motivation. Shout-out to Mick Gordon for being my training playlist to get me through prep!

The history of twin-tailed sirens and serpent-footed monsters.,"https://preview.redd.it/yyx36kvvqavf1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55d40c18f7e4058a875dd643e2de8799f271f901

If you ever ordered a drink at Starbucks, most of you might have noticed the strange crowned lady in the company's logo. That is nothing less than a two-tailed mermaid: a figure facing forwards, grasping legs curved up at her sides, who has appeared in statues, manuscripts, and reliefs for thousands of years.

All of this information can be seen in the account [https://www.tumblr.com/twintailedsiren](https://www.tumblr.com/twintailedsiren), who researches the History of these figures with two fish or serpent tails for legs.

In a nutshell, the twin-tailed siren motif has a long and complex story. It's generally believed that this motif comes from a Scythian (modern-day Ukraine to Central Asia) snake-legged goddess, whose first depictions date as far back as 800 years BC. It might be associated with the ""Mistress of Animals"" ancient art motif, which depicts a front-facing woman grasping wild animals at her flanks.

A Scythian woman with two snakes legs appears in Greek mythology, stealing the cattle of Geryon from Heracles during his passage in Scythia and bearing the first ancestors of the Scythian people with him. Those of you who read Percy Jackson might be familiar with her through the Scythian Dracaena in Chronos' army.

But the most relevant tail-legged creatures in Greco-Roman art come from four monsters: Scylla, Typhon, the Giants, and the Tritons.

# Scylla

https://preview.redd.it/3p8tzkf9pavf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52fb9c88201274b8787980793c7303a190a07cf3

Scylla is the famous Homeric monster who snatches six of Odysseus' crewmen when he sails through a narrow strait, with Charybdis on the other side. Her description in the Odyssey is rather enigmatic: she has twelve dangling legs and six long necks ending in hideous heads with triple rows of teeth, which she uses to snatch sea animals from the water below. The rest of her body is hidden inside her cave, so Odysseus never gets to describe it. She also has a voice similar to that of a newborn puppy.

Artistic representations provide a clearer image of Scylla. She is usually depicted as a woman with the serpentine tail of a fish in place of legs and a cluster of multiple dog fore-parts sprouting from her waist, which are the heads that eat Odysseus's men.

However, in Etruscan art, Scylla has two fish tails. Sometimes, she doesn't even have the dog heads, but she is still recognizable through her oar or stone, leaf skirt, and twin tails. Her fish tails are long and coiled like tentacles, which she occasionally uses to capture sailors, and may rarely end in animal heads like Typhon's. Scylla is a very popular subject on tombs and urns, which may mean that, in Etruscan mythology, she was a guardian of the Underworld, like Cerberus, or even a psychopomp.

The two-tailed Scylla migrated to Greece and Rome, and can be seen on coins, statues, mirrors, and even implied in Roman literature: Virgil speaks of ""double-shaped Scyllae"" at the doors of the Underworld in the Aeneid.

# Typhon and the Giants

https://preview.redd.it/cq5m42i2qavf1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fab52b9427885aeb77e44b470ee0b65a3ff2b84

Typhon might be the most formidable enemy of the gods: a beast of vengeance who disputed against Zeus for the cosmos. Literature describes him as a horrid hybrid with serpents instead of legs, and art is compatible. Vases, reliefs, and statues show Typhon as a bearded men with pointed ears, wings, and at least two serpent bodies beneath the waist, either intertwined or opposed. Like the two-tailed Scylla, Typhon frequently appears in Etruscan art.

https://preview.redd.it/newoyrr9qavf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1170aa2c297e606d5d8acc8cf31dcd307753122d

Similar to Typhon are the Gigantes, an entire army created by Gaia to oppose the gods. The Gigantes are unique here in that their Archaic and Classical depictions show them as otherwise normal soldiers in armor, but later art shows them with serpents instead of legs; likely an influence from Typhon. This was widespread enough to appear in literature, as Ovid calls them serpent-footed and Pseudo-Apollodorus says they have scales on their feet.

The main difference is that, while Scylla and Typhon are upright and have symmetrical or dangled tails, the Giants are usually shown kneeled over their serpent legs.

# Tritons

https://preview.redd.it/n5w0nd4oqavf1.jpg?width=299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33a9fffd345eade5b7fcef3c10de4cdc98f3f828

In Greek mythology, the Sirens were bird-women instead of mermaids. Nonetheless, there were still many mermen in art, collectively referred to as Tritons ‚Äî the plural of Triton, a god son of Poseidon consistently depicted as a man with a fish tail instead of legs. From the 4th century BC onward, Tritons began to be depicted with two fish tails in mosaics, frescoes, and statues. Similar to the Gigantes, the Tritons are shown kneeled on their tails, rather than facing forward in symmetry.

# The two-tailed mermaid in the Middle Ages

https://preview.redd.it/myum6ci8ravf1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49d84b54ca2a303829c22e049891b019bb20e9bf

This all leads us to the twin-tailed siren. In the Romanesque period, after the end of Antiquity, mermaids with two tails became a common motif in architecture. Likely inspired by Scylla and the Scythian snake-legged woman, these mermaids hold their fins close to their heads, making two symmetrical arcs with their tails. The symmetry and curves make for an engaging motif, and two-tailed mermaids thus appear in multiple churches among a cluster of other fantastical hybrids and grotesques decorating the walls and columns with their surreal visages.

It was one of those mermaids that Starbucks chose for their logo in the 1970's. Differently from Scylla, however, these twin-tailed mermaids often didn't have leaf skirts to cover themselves with, so eventually, Starbucks cropped and stylized the image to hide the open tail legs.

Why do I need to climb 3 different ranks to do an adjacent job to the one I already do, and go down multiple pay levels too... at my current job I get paid $21/hour not including tips because I've worked here so long and incrued raises.

Other things too, but I don‚Äôt want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Maybe because I haven‚Äôt slept properly in weeks. Every time I close my eyes, I see it again‚Äîthe black shape standing among the trees.
If someone had told me I‚Äôd be talking about things like this, I would‚Äôve laughed in their face. But here I am, typing this, and my hands are slightly shaking.

It started one of those strangely warm October Saturdays, the kind where the air smells of dry leaves and dust. My friend Petar and I decided to hike up Djendem Hill. Just for fun‚Äîto drink some coffee at the top and look out over the city.
I‚Äôve always loved that place. There‚Äôs something heavy about it, ancient, almost alive. The Turks used to call it Djendem‚Äîwhich means Hell. My grandmother once told me that at night, you can hear footsteps up there, but you must never ask who‚Äôs there. I laughed at that when I was a kid. Now I wouldn‚Äôt dare.

It was around noon. The sun was high, the air was trembling with heat, and everything was oddly still. We sat on the rocks near the antenna, just watching Plovdiv spread beneath us like a toy city. Then Petar went quiet. He squinted and nodded toward the trees.
‚ÄúDo you see that down there?‚Äù he said.

At first, I thought it was a man. But the longer I stared, the less human it seemed. I couldn‚Äôt make out any features‚Äîno clothes, no face, no light reflecting off it. It was just‚Ä¶ black. But not the color black. It was the absence of light. Like a hole in reality.

Then I smelled it‚Äîburnt metal, mixed with something foul, like rotten eggs. Petar swore under his breath and said we should go. But I couldn‚Äôt move.
That thing‚Ä¶ it turned toward us. Not the way a person turns. It didn‚Äôt move‚Äîjust shifted, as if the space around it had rearranged itself. The air grew thicker, heavier. Everything went silent‚Äîno birds, no wind, not even the distant hum of the city.

And then came the sound. I can‚Äôt even call it a voice. More like a whisper scraping through metal. I couldn‚Äôt understand the words, but it felt like they were echoing inside my skull, not in my ears.

The next second, it was gone. No movement, no sound‚Äîjust gone. The silence that followed was worse than anything. Petar was already halfway down the path, yelling at me to move. I finally did.

When we got to the bottom, neither of us spoke. He looked pale, like all the blood had drained from his face. He just said,
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me. I don‚Äôt want to remember this,‚Äù
and walked away.

The next day, I texted him. No answer. Two days later, I heard he‚Äôd been taken to the hospital‚Äîsome kind of breakdown, they said. His mother told me he‚Äôd wake up screaming at night, saying the black one was standing by his window.

I haven‚Äôt been the same since. At night, when the lights are off, I keep seeing something in my peripheral vision‚Äîshapes darker than the darkness itself. Sometimes, if I listen closely, I can still hear that metallic whisper, faint and distant, like breath on the back of my neck.

And the worst part?
Last week, I was standing on my balcony. From there, you can see the whole hill. And right on the top, where we‚Äôd been sitting that day, I saw it again‚Äîa black figure. Motionless. Watching the city below.

Maybe I‚Äôm imagining things. Maybe fear‚Äôs just messing with my mind.
But deep down, I know one thing for sure:

1o7e7wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HideMyNet/comments/1o7e7wn/why_would_someone_need_a_vpn/,Why Would Someone Need a VPN?,"A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is needed to protect your online privacy and security. It encrypts your internet connection, making it impossible for hackers, ISPs, or public Wi-Fi networks to track your data or see what you‚Äôre doing online. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi in places like cafes, airports, or hotels, where your personal information can be easily stolen.

**What I Look for in a VPN**

When choosing a VPN, I focused on what mattered most for my daily **operations**:

* **No-logs policy:** I want zero records of my browsing.
* **Robust encryption:** AES-256 is my go-to for security.
* **Expeditious speeds:** Crucial for streaming shows or gaming.
* **Global servers:** More servers mean better access to content.
* **Reliable protocols:** Options like Wire Guard or OpenVPN for smooth, secure connections.
* **Fair pricing:** Good protection shouldn‚Äôt cost a **fortune**.

# My Experience with Top VPNs

I tested a mix of well-known and newer VPNs to see how they performed in **practice**. Here‚Äôs what stood out.

# CoverMeVPN

I tried this lesser-known VPN, and here‚Äôs what surprised me: it delivered strong encryption and a no-logs policy that gave me **tranquility**. Streaming Netflix and Hulu was effortless with no geo-blocks, and the speeds were solid for gaming too. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use for beginners like me, and still has enough features for advanced users. It felt like a great **well-rounded** choice.

# NordVPN

This is a heavy hitter I kept **hearing** about. Its Double VPN and extra security features made me feel secure, especially on public Wi-Fi. The huge server network meant I could always find a fast connection, and it never felt sluggish, whether I was browsing or streaming.

# ExpressVPN

This one was a **marvel** for streaming. I could access Netflix instantly, and the speeds were so fast I forgot I was using a VPN. The apps were super easy to navigate, and its Lightway protocol kept things secure without slowing me down. It‚Äôs pricier, but it delivered every **time**.

# Surfshark

Surfshark was a budget-friendly **victory**. I loved that I could connect all my devices‚Äîphone, laptop, you name it‚Äîwithout limits. It balanced speed and security well, and the price felt like a steal for what I got. It worked smoothly for both streaming and casual browsing.

# ProtonVPN

Coming from the ProtonMail team, this one felt **reliable** from the start. Its focus on privacy was clear, and I appreciated the transparency. The free tier was handy for testing, but it had limits on servers and speed. The paid version was much better and worth it for privacy-conscious users like me.

# Why I Won‚Äôt Browse Without a VPN

Here‚Äôs why a VPN became **essential** for me:

* **Privacy protection:** It stops ISPs and advertisers from tracking my every click.
* **Public Wi-Fi safety:** I feel secure checking my bank account at a **coffee shop**.
* **Bypassing restrictions:** I can access content blocked in my region.
* **Streaming freedom:** I watch shows and sports from anywhere in the world.
* **Secure transactions:** Shopping and banking stay private and safe.

**üöÄ Wrapping Up**  
In today‚Äôs digital world, protecting your privacy, security, and freedom online isn‚Äôt optional; it‚Äôs essential.

Well-known providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark dominate the spotlight, but newer services such as [CoverMeVPN](https://covermevpn.com/) are stepping up with powerful encryption, competitive features, and budget-friendly plans.

1o7e6l2,https://i.redd.it/upsp8668navf1.jpeg,"CAMPLUX RGS21MSF Review, Compact 21 Inch RV Propane Range with 3 Burners","# Introduction: Small Range, Big Personality

If you‚Äôve ever tried cooking in an RV kitchen, you already know‚Äîspace is basically the final boss of frustration. You want to cook like you‚Äôre at home, but your ‚Äúcounter‚Äù doubles as a cutting board, dish rack, and coffee station. Enter the **CAMPLUX RGS21MSF**, a **compact 21-inch RV propane range** that somehow manages to fit *three burners and a full oven* into a setup small enough to make even the tiniest camper feel like a chef‚Äôs playground.

I‚Äôve used my fair share of **RV stoves with ovens**, and most of them felt more like survival tools than cooking appliances. But this **Camplux RV stove** changed that for me. It‚Äôs functional, efficient, and surprisingly classy for something that runs on LP gas. So let‚Äôs talk about what makes this little powerhouse worth every inch of space it takes up.

# Why the CAMPLUX RGS21MSF Stands Out

Ever seen an appliance that looks way too good for its environment? That‚Äôs this stove. The **Camplux RGS21MSF** brings stainless steel sophistication to an RV setup without being flashy or out of place. It‚Äôs sturdy, sleek, and honestly‚Äîkind of makes you want to cook.

Here‚Äôs the quick rundown:

* **Size:** 21 inches wide ‚Äì ideal for compact RV kitchens
* **Burners:** 3 high-efficiency burners
* **Oven Power:** 28,100 BTU total cooking power
* **Ignition:** Piezo ignition (no matches needed)
* **Finish:** Stainless steel front with a glass oven door
* **Fuel Type:** Propane (LP Gas)

For RVers who spend weekends off-grid or live full-time on wheels, this range hits that sweet spot between compact design and full cooking capability.

# Design & Build Quality: Compact, But Not Compromised

Let‚Äôs start with the look because, IMO, that‚Äôs the first thing you notice. The **stainless steel RV range** exterior gives it a clean, professional vibe. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfancy kitchen‚Äù level, but it‚Äôs definitely not ‚Äúcamp stove from 1989‚Äù either.

The **sturdy metal grates** are heavy-duty and hold pans firmly without wobbling. You can actually use full-size skillets or a Dutch oven (as long as you‚Äôre not making Thanksgiving dinner for twelve). The **oven glass door** is heat-resistant and lets you peek inside without opening the door every 30 seconds‚Äîsaving heat and propane.

What I love most? The control knobs feel solid. No cheap plastic wiggle here. You‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre turning on a real home stove, not a toy.

# Performance: Three Burners That Actually Mean Business

Here‚Äôs where the **Camplux RV stove** really shines. Most **RV ranges** claim to have ‚Äúthree burners,‚Äù but two are usually weaklings that can barely boil water. Not this one.

Each burner on the **RGS21MSF** delivers consistent flame control and heats up fast. Whether you‚Äôre frying bacon, boiling pasta, or saut√©ing veggies, you‚Äôll notice how balanced the heat feels.

# Burner Breakdown:

* **Front Right Burner:** High-output burner ‚Äì perfect for fast boiling.
* **Front Left & Rear Burners:** Medium burners ‚Äì ideal for simmering or gentle cooking.

The **28,100 BTU output** is impressive for an RV appliance this size. It cooks evenly and doesn‚Äôt sputter out when the wind blows through your open RV window (been there, done that).

# The Oven: Yes, You Can Bake in Your RV

This is the part most people doubt‚Äîcan an **RV propane oven** actually bake well? Short answer: yes, surprisingly well.

The **Camplux RV oven** maintains a steady temperature thanks to its **oven thermostat control**. You can bake cookies, pizza, casseroles, or even roast a small chicken without babysitting it the entire time.

* **Preheat Time:** Roughly 10‚Äì12 minutes to reach 350¬∞F
* **Temperature Range:** 200¬∞F to 500¬∞F
* **Ignition:** Piezo ignition for quick startup
* **Safety Feature:** Built-in oven safety shutoff

That thermostat control is a game-changer for anyone tired of playing ‚Äúguess the temperature.‚Äù It‚Äôs accurate enough that your brownies won‚Äôt turn into charcoal, and your lasagna will come out golden on top.

# Ease of Use: Simple Setup, Smooth Operation

If you‚Äôre not a fan of complicated installs (who is?), the **Camplux RGS21MSF** will make you happy. It‚Äôs designed for **standard 21-inch RV range cutouts**, so most setups will fit it perfectly.

# Installation Highlights:

* Standard **3/8-inch RV propane hookup**
* No electrical connection needed (fully propane-powered)
* Easy-access rear gas port
* Lightweight design for one-person installation (around 55 lbs)

Once installed, it‚Äôs plug-and-play. The **piezo ignition** works with a quick click, and the flame control is smooth. There‚Äôs no waiting or fiddling‚Äîjust light, cook, and enjoy.

üëâ [**Check the current price and details on Amazon here**](https://amzn.to/48s7tBS)

# Cooking Experience: Feels Almost Like Home

If you‚Äôre like me, you judge a range not by how it looks, but by how it cooks. And this **Camplux RV oven stove combo** surprised me.

You can easily run three pots at once without running out of space. The **heat distribution** across the burners feels balanced, and the **grates stay stable** even with heavy cookware.

I cooked a full breakfast‚Äîeggs, bacon, and pancakes‚Äîon all three burners. No uneven cooking, no propane sputters, and no burnt edges. The oven even handled cinnamon rolls like a champ.

One small thing: the oven timer is manual, so no beeping when your cookies are done. But hey, sometimes that‚Äôs a blessing if you don‚Äôt want alarms echoing in a small camper.

# Safety and Efficiency: Built Smart

Safety isn‚Äôt glamorous, but it‚Äôs essential‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre cooking in a metal box on wheels. The **Camplux RGS21MSF** includes an **oven safety shutoff** that stops gas flow if the flame goes out. That‚Äôs peace of mind when you‚Äôre boondocking miles from the nearest service station.

Plus, the **stainless finish** resists corrosion and is easy to clean. A quick wipe-down after cooking keeps it looking new. It‚Äôs efficient with propane, too. Even with daily use, you won‚Äôt see your tank draining faster than usual.

And FYI, if you like cooking off-grid, this thing is built for **boondocking propane setups**. It runs entirely on LP gas, so you can cook even when your battery‚Äôs taking a nap.

# Comparing It to Other RV Ranges

So how does it stack up against other models like the **Suburban 22‚Äù RV Range** or the **Furrion 2-in-1 Stove/Oven**?

* **Size:** The **Camplux RGS21MSF** wins for small-space compatibility.
* **Power:** It matches or beats most models in total BTU.
* **Build Quality:** Comparable to Furrion, and more durable than entry-level Suburban units.
* **Design:** Sleeker front panel and better oven visibility (thanks to that glass door).

If you want something compact, powerful, and stylish, the **Camplux RV stove** feels like the smarter pick‚Äîespecially for the price point.

# Pros & Cons Summary

# Pros:

* Compact **21-inch RV range** fits small spaces perfectly
* **3 powerful burners** with even flame distribution
* **28,100 BTU total output** (stronger than most in its class)
* Reliable **piezo ignition** system
* **Glass oven door** for easy monitoring
* **Oven thermostat control** ensures consistent baking
* Easy to install with standard **3/8 propane hookup**
* **Stainless steel finish** looks modern and resists rust

# Cons:

* No built-in electronic timer or light
* Oven size limits large dishes (no full turkey, sorry)
* Manual ignition may require a learning curve for new users

Still, these are minor trade-offs for the value you‚Äôre getting.

# Who Should Buy the CAMPLUX RGS21MSF?

If you:

* Live or travel in a small RV, camper, or trailer
* Want to **upgrade your RV kitchen stove** without major remodeling
* Prefer reliable, propane-only cooking (no electric fuss)
* Enjoy off-grid adventures or **boondocking**
* Appreciate appliances that look as good as they cook

Then the **Camplux RGS21MSF** is a perfect fit. It‚Äôs built for travelers who don‚Äôt compromise on good food, even when cooking miles from home.

# Maintenance Tips & Longevity

Want your **RV propane oven** to last? A few small habits make a big difference:

1. **Clean after every trip.** Wipe spills and grease immediately to prevent corrosion.
2. **Check your propane connections** regularly for leaks using soapy water.
3. **Don‚Äôt slam the oven door**‚Äîit‚Äôs sturdy, but the glass deserves some respect.
4. **Use aluminum liners** or baking mats to keep the bottom clean.
5. **Light the burners weekly** (even if you‚Äôre not traveling) to prevent clogs.

Follow these and your **Camplux RGS21MSF** will easily outlive your next road trip playlist.

# Final Thoughts: Small Range, Big Flavor

The **Camplux RGS21MSF** isn‚Äôt just another **RV range replacement**; it‚Äôs a serious upgrade for anyone who loves real cooking on the road. Compact, powerful, and surprisingly refined, it gives you a full kitchen experience without taking over your tiny camper.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Whether you‚Äôre a weekend wanderer or a full-time RVer, this **21-inch stainless steel RV range** makes cooking easy, efficient, and genuinely fun.

Just don‚Äôt blame me if you start hosting campground dinners afterward. üòâ

1o7e54w,https://i.redd.it/6k3f2mchnavf1.jpeg,Shark Tank Brands Failing the Trust Test? [Concerning],"For those who don't know, Trustified is a platform known for its 100% blind testing of consumer products to check for label accuracy, contaminants, and general product quality. Their recent ""Shark Tank Series"" of tests has been really shocking:

GetAWay Ice Cream: This brand, which positions itself as a healthy, high protein, no sugar alternative, miserably failed the lab test. The results showed significantly less protein and drastically higher carbohydrate content than claimed on the label. A brand banking on the 'healthy' label, this is a massive betrayal of consumer trust, especially for those with health conditions or on specific diets.

Go Zero: Yet another 'healthy' ice cream brand. This one failed due to label mismatch and false claims, which again points to a serious lack of quality control and accurate consumer information.

VS Mani Coffee: The third brand tested in the series, and the third brand to fail the lab test.

That's three out of three tested Shark Tank brands reportedly failing basic label and quality checks.

Shark Tank is to give a platform and a massive boost to promising, quality checked businesses. We know the Sharks and the show's production team conduct incredibly rigorous financial and legal due diligence before a pitch even airs. They check the books, the market size, the legal structure everything to ensure the investment is sound.

But are they doing the necessary ""product due diligence""?

When a brand gets the 'Shark Tank Seal of Approval,' it is effectively an endorsement by some of India's leading business figures. Millions of consumers rush to buy these products, trusting that they have been vetted for not just a good business model, but also for product integrity, safety, and honest labeling.
If multiple brands, especially those in the sensitive health and food categories, are allegedly failing basic lab tests on their core claims, it raises a massive red flag.

Why is the product due diligence not as rigorous as the financial due diligence?
Getting a aired on Shark Tank is an massive marketing boost. If the show is giving this invaluable platform to brands that are reportedly engaging in such shady, misleading practices, be it through outright lies about protein/sugar content or simple label sloppiness - they are, perhaps unintentionally, becoming an accomplice to the misleading of millions of consumers.

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? I gathered my breath and looked toward the voided ocean. I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. It must have been an old wasp nest from the summer, the worn out boards must attract them each year. Maybe I blinked and that‚Äôs what made me think I saw what I did. That didn‚Äôt explain the texture of it. If it was a dead nest, why wasn‚Äôt it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. Whatever it was, it was gone now. I certainly wasn‚Äôt going under the boardwalk to find out where it went. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ‚ÄúHello, It‚Äôs Me‚Äù, Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn‚Äôt been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù.

‚ÄúYour drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?‚Äù he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

‚ÄúOh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.‚Äù

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. There‚Äôs only one way to drink it and that‚Äôs ice cold. If your local watering hole doesn‚Äôt keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don‚Äôt bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, buddy.‚Äù He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. After the night I had, that shot went down awfully smooth. After a brief silence, he spoke up.

‚ÄúYou alright, man? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my slowly racing heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent‚Äôs.

When she saw it was me, she smiled and waved. I returned the favor and she made her way to the vacated seat next to me.

‚ÄúDo you come here often?‚Äù she said with a faux twang accent.

‚ÄúI-uh‚Ä¶ reckon.‚Äù I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

I looked out around the bar to find that it was only us. Tommy was missing in action, smoking outside undoubtedly.

‚ÄúLooks like we have the place all to ourselves,‚Äù she remarked with a grin.

‚ÄúTommy shouldn‚Äôt have left the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there.‚Äù I quipped. 

She laughed. ‚ÄúPerfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.‚Äù

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to another summer in the books,‚Äù she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ‚ÄúSo are you local year round?‚Äù

I shook my head yes and clarified, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?‚Äù

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent‚Äôs and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven‚Äôt been on one for miles.

‚ÄúEnough about me, what are you up to?‚Äù A question I was dreading. Maybe it was the brandy talking, I answered very plainly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to figure somethings out. It‚Äôs been a very long couple of years.‚Äù

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

I shook it off. ‚ÄúNot particularly, it‚Äôll pass. Just a matter of time.‚Äù

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

‚ÄúHey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre‚Äôs, actually. We have one just like it.‚Äù

She looked down and declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hilarious, that‚Äôs where I stole this from!‚Äù

We both laughed.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúThe staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.‚Äù

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song ‚Äî ‚ÄúThese Eyes‚Äù by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ‚ÄúThe Stones are my dad‚Äôs favorite band. He named me Angie after the song.‚Äù 

I liked that, it fit her.

‚ÄúMy dad loved them too,‚Äù I concurred. ‚ÄúHe took me to see them when I was a kid.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúSounds like a great dad to me.‚Äù

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me ‚Äî maybe she‚Äôd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she inquired.

‚ÄúYeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.‚Äù

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would‚Äôve seen it, right? Unless‚Ä¶ did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre‚Äôs.‚Äù

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone ‚Äî few missed calls, few texts I didn‚Äôt care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick‚Äôs. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn‚Äôt like to be kept waiting ‚Äî Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ‚ÄúI have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.‚Äù

Angie smiled wide. ‚ÄúI love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?‚Äù

There was a pause. I didn‚Äôt know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn‚Äôt feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she‚Äôs good I‚Äôll grab a slice for her this weekend.‚Äù

That was the best I could do. It was better than ‚ÄúRun as fast as you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need me to walk you home?‚Äù

She responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It‚Äôs their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.‚Äù

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ‚ÄúI can wait here with her, I‚Äôm still cleaning up. I‚Äôll see you tomorrow night.‚Äù

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit, waving goodbye. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ‚ÄúYou never told me your name!‚Äù

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality ‚Äî this one was thick and palatable. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights ‚Äî an offseason signature ‚Äî and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky. Living by the water teaches you to prepare for weather that changes on a dime.

I crept to the corner, hoping to get a glimpse of where my fateful fall had taken place hours before. The only thing I could make out was the beginning of the ramp that led to the boardwalk. The mixture of fog and Mick‚Äôs bright neon sign only gave me passing glimpses of Mighty King Kong‚Äôs scowl.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there ‚Äî just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area ‚Äî no sight of the album. It was around this time that the fog momentarily cleared that I noticed it was a full moon. If there was indeed a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning.

I decided I was being paranoid. Enough was enough. I took my phone out with resolve and took confident steps to the mouth of the boardwalk. I turned my flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took two steps forward, searching the sandy floor ‚Äî nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot.

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the front of the album sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye ‚Äî the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn‚Äôt stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my trembling feet prevailed. This went on forever, using the sand underneath as camouflage. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate ‚Äî it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

Maybe because I haven‚Äôt slept properly in weeks. Every time I close my eyes, I see it again‚Äîthe black shape standing among the trees.
If someone had told me I‚Äôd be talking about things like this, I would‚Äôve laughed in their face. But here I am, typing this, and my hands are slightly shaking.

It started one of those strangely warm October Saturdays, the kind where the air smells of dry leaves and dust. My friend Petar and I decided to hike up Djendem Hill. Just for fun‚Äîto drink some coffee at the top and look out over the city.
I‚Äôve always loved that place. There‚Äôs something heavy about it, ancient, almost alive. The Turks used to call it Djendem‚Äîwhich means Hell. My grandmother once told me that at night, you can hear footsteps up there, but you must never ask who‚Äôs there. I laughed at that when I was a kid. Now I wouldn‚Äôt dare.

It was around noon. The sun was high, the air was trembling with heat, and everything was oddly still. We sat on the rocks near the antenna, just watching Plovdiv spread beneath us like a toy city. Then Petar went quiet. He squinted and nodded toward the trees.
‚ÄúDo you see that down there?‚Äù he said.

At first, I thought it was a man. But the longer I stared, the less human it seemed. I couldn‚Äôt make out any features‚Äîno clothes, no face, no light reflecting off it. It was just‚Ä¶ black. But not the color black. It was the absence of light. Like a hole in reality.

Then I smelled it‚Äîburnt metal, mixed with something foul, like rotten eggs. Petar swore under his breath and said we should go. But I couldn‚Äôt move.
That thing‚Ä¶ it turned toward us. Not the way a person turns. It didn‚Äôt move‚Äîjust shifted, as if the space around it had rearranged itself. The air grew thicker, heavier. Everything went silent‚Äîno birds, no wind, not even the distant hum of the city.

And then came the sound. I can‚Äôt even call it a voice. More like a whisper scraping through metal. I couldn‚Äôt understand the words, but it felt like they were echoing inside my skull, not in my ears.

The next second, it was gone. No movement, no sound‚Äîjust gone. The silence that followed was worse than anything. Petar was already halfway down the path, yelling at me to move. I finally did.

When we got to the bottom, neither of us spoke. He looked pale, like all the blood had drained from his face. He just said,
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me. I don‚Äôt want to remember this,‚Äù
and walked away.

The next day, I texted him. No answer. Two days later, I heard he‚Äôd been taken to the hospital‚Äîsome kind of breakdown, they said. His mother told me he‚Äôd wake up screaming at night, saying the black one was standing by his window.

I haven‚Äôt been the same since. At night, when the lights are off, I keep seeing something in my peripheral vision‚Äîshapes darker than the darkness itself. Sometimes, if I listen closely, I can still hear that metallic whisper, faint and distant, like breath on the back of my neck.

And the worst part?
Last week, I was standing on my balcony. From there, you can see the whole hill. And right on the top, where we‚Äôd been sitting that day, I saw it again‚Äîa black figure. Motionless. Watching the city below.

Maybe I‚Äôm imagining things. Maybe fear‚Äôs just messing with my mind.
But deep down, I know one thing for sure:

Coffee is one of the most loved drinks in the world. Every morning, millions of people wake up and grab a cup to start their day. It helps them feel awake, focused, and happy. But have you ever wondered, *how much coffee is too much*?

According to the **National Coffee Association (NCA)**, about **65% of Americans drink coffee daily**. On average, one person drinks **about 3 cups of coffee per day**. That‚Äôs around **400 million cups every single day** in the U.S. alone!

People love coffee not only for its taste but also because it helps with:

* Morning energy boost ‚òÄÔ∏è
* Better focus and concentration üß†
* Improved mood üòä
* Social connection (coffee breaks, chats, caf√© visits) ü´∂

However, too much of anything ‚Äî even something good ‚Äî can cause problems.

At [**gomehedi.com**](http://gomehedi.com), we often get questions like:

#  What Experts Say ‚Äî How Many Cups Are Safe Per Day?

The **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** says that **up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per day** is considered safe for most healthy adults.

That‚Äôs equal to about:

* **4 regular cups (8 oz each) of brewed coffee**, or
* **2 large caf√© coffees (16 oz each)**

But remember ‚Äî caffeine levels vary depending on the type of coffee.

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine (per 8 oz)|Safe Cups per Day|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Brewed Coffee|95 mg|4 cups|
|Instant Coffee|60‚Äì80 mg|5‚Äì6 cups|
|Espresso (1 oz shot)|63 mg|About 6 shots|
|Decaf Coffee|2‚Äì5 mg|No major limit|

*(Data source: FDA & Mayo Clinic)*

So, for most people, **3‚Äì4 cups per day** is safe and even offers health benefits.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è But When Is It Too Much?

If you drink **more than 5‚Äì6 cups daily**, you might face:

* Trouble sleeping üò¥
* Nervousness or jittery feelings üò¨
* Fast heartbeat üíì
* Stomach upset ü§¢
* Headaches or irritability üòñ

For **pregnant women**, doctors recommend **no more than 200 mg** of caffeine daily ‚Äî about **2 cups of coffee**.

Now you know that **up to 4 cups a day** is safe for most people. But the goal isn‚Äôt just counting cups ‚Äî it‚Äôs finding your **perfect coffee balance**.

Here‚Äôs a simple guide to help you discover how much coffee is right for *you*.

# ‚òëÔ∏è Step-by-Step Coffee Check

1. **Start with 1‚Äì2 cups a day.** See how you feel ‚Äî energized or anxious.
2. **Notice your sleep.** If you can‚Äôt fall asleep easily, reduce your coffee intake or drink it earlier in the day.
3. **Stay hydrated.** Coffee is slightly dehydrating, so drink enough water.

* Reduced risk of **heart disease** ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Lower chance of **type 2 diabetes** üíâ
* Protection against **liver disease** ü©∏

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Signs You‚Äôre Drinking Too Much

When that happens, try switching to **low-acid or decaf coffee**.

Is democracy truly at risk? In just ten short months, phrases like ‚Äú[**democratic backsliding**](https://www.ifes.org/pub/Paths-to-Democratic-Resilience-in-an-Era-of-Backsliding/Defining-key-concepts),‚Äù ‚Äúauthoritarian playbook,‚Äù and ‚Äú[**illiberalism**](https://www.illiberalism.org/illiberalism-conceptual-introduction/)‚Äù have been introduced into our political lives, as the debate over democracy moves from the abstract to the everyday. The targeting of political opponents, disinformation, corporate capitulation, election interference, domestic militarization, and the weakening of checks on executive power‚Äîthings that once seemed unthinkable, now feel dangerously close. ¬†

But there are still more questions than answers: Do we have the right vocabulary to describe what‚Äôs happening to American democracy? As the election for governor approaches, how will these changes impact us in Virginia and in Richmond? What role does technology play in accelerating these trends? Or maybe this is just another cycle of American politics, destined to pass us by?¬†

Still, America‚Äôs not alone in grappling with these challenges. What‚Äôs happening abroad cannot be separated from what‚Äôs happening at home. For the first time in over two decades,¬†[**democracy is in retreat**](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/60/V-dem-dr__2025_lowres.pdf)¬†across the world.

A man in some fine silk pajamas came sprinting into the room. I knew him. He was me. I mean, he was clearly a separate entity, now, but I knew he was... at some point, me. Or maybe we were both something else before, back when were were still one. Jim's arse, I looked like shit. Like I'd been awake on meth for a week. I mean the other me looked like shit. My me me looked fit and strong.

""Bweetop scoodoodle bop."" He said. ""Neuronga tripito?

""Ahh... Wish I really was a linguist."" I thought for a moment. ""I don't suppose you understand me do you?""

He looked as confused as I was by his word sounds with that cocked an eyebrow.  I'd take that as a no. 

We both started stroking our chins. Mine clean shaven, his several weeks untended. I was thinking I, 'Wish I had a real beard right now too.' I stroked my chin again and Riker's Beard! I had it, a solution.

""Darmok, and-"" I started, but he cut in.

""Jelad! At-"" I join him

""Tenagra!"" We shouted together. We shared a brief laugh. It was a start.

""Rai and Jiri and Luhnga?"" I asked. 'Are we new friends meeting together in a place of peace?'

""Lungha, her sky grey."" he replied. 'We're friends, but shit's fucked here.'

He beckoned me over to monitor on the wall and shouted some more jibberish I didn't understand to others who were no doubt listening. A moment later a satellite image of a growing scourge mass appeared on the monitor. 

""Lungha, her sky black."" I replied. 'Dawg shit is MAD fucked here.'

#Dilt

My far more physically fit doppelg√§nger was right. We were fucking boned. 

""Shaka, when the walls fell."" I told him, ""Mirab his sails unfurled.""  'Our defenses have shattered. We should run through the portal.'

But he shook his head, no. ""Ekiteo, his eyes closed."" 'You do not see the truth.' 

""Krototic mumbalogo nit."" He said into his wrist comm, and a few seconds later four elephant sized powered armors walked through the open portal. They had little holograms of the man inside's face floating in front a few seconds after they came through. It was very effective in making me not shit my pants, which had been my initial instinct on seeing them come through the portal. I didn't know what any of those weapons did exactly, but they were obviously loaded for bear... or Scourge.

""Tembo, His arms wide,"" stated my handsome new friend. 'A gift.' 

He gave some orders to his four men in human jibberish, and very shortly a few more, non powered armor people poured through the portal, and started running tests and doing support tasks on the powered armor. They spoke quietly, and in the same Earthican way as my better looking self, fitter self.

""Darmok,"" I placed a flat palm on my chest to indicated myself, ""and Jelad,"" I put a hand on his chest. 

""Ingamar,"" He said, and put my hand back on my own chest.

""Dilt."" I replied.

""Ingamar and Dilt at Terra."" He pointed at the monitor with growing scourge mass on the planet below. ""The Beast of Terra.""  

""Uzani, his army at Terra?"" I pointed at the four Purifier class powered armor suits that had come through the portal. 'You ARE here to help, right?'

He looked at his support staff running last minute checks on the power armor, and they gave him a series of thumbs up. Good to know that hand sign hasn't changed in 1500 years. 

""Uzani, his army with fist open."" Ingamar pointed at the scourge mass on the monitor, then punched his own open palm and twisted his fist back and forth like smooshing a bug. ""Uzani, his army with fist closed.""  

'We are ready to strike.'

I nodded. 

""Be a dear, dear and bring up the quickest path to an airlock off this space station to this monitor. I think our new friends here want out. I'm pretty sure they're going to fuck up that scourge mass real bad.""

The route on the monitor appeared, it wasn't far, only a few doors away. Ingamar pointed at it and said, ""Jrept tepellium, skitopple dopple."" 

""Hup Hup."" The four powered armors answered before they marched out of the room straight to the airlock. Ingamar and I followed. The Krethellic in the halls ran terrified of the human warcrimes machines as they made their way to the airlock. Fair enough. And for the human's part, I must say, good on them not trying to kill the big ol bug people. Truly the only thing deserving of being fired at by a Purifier suit is the Scourge. 

The airlock was only large enough for one suit to fit at a time. The men in the massive suits played rock-paper-scissors via their hologram projectors in the hall outside the airlock to see who got to go first. They were... *excited* to go fight the Scourge.

Doug the Australian won, and got to go first. He'd rack up the most biomass destruction, and earn a nice bonus when he eventually got back to civilization. Not that this wasn't civilized... but you know what I mean. 

Doug didn't wait for the others when he got out into space, and immediately put himself on an insertion vector to land basically on top of the scourge. 

""Oi, what a shite. He's not even waiting."" Finneas, the Scot was next, He also didn't wait and immediately set himself on an insertion vector to land on or about the scourge mass. 

Scott the Etebian was third, he dropped in with a ""FOR ETEB!"" as his battlecry.  

Frank the Canadian was the last one out, ""I know you aren't a real linguist eh, but if you could figure out a translation matrix for us before we're done that'd be swell. There was a real cutie I saw in the halls and I wanna ask her out when I'm done saving her planet. You think girls here still like poutine? I brought supplies in my kit to make it through the portal.""

""Probably, if they don't you can reintroduce them."" I told him, and then I hit the cycle airlock button and jettisoned him in his powered armor suit into space. 

Not that Dilt would understand, but I put the four purifier's comm line on speaker from a tablet I'd borrowed from the Earth support staff. 

Doug: ""Sweet fuck, this planet is like a fucking scourge wet dream. At least this continent is. Did these idiots have a nuclear war with one another here or some dumb shit like that.""

Finneas: ""Ahh shite, this isn't going to be just a fucking milkrun then is it? Everyone spool up your Abaddon bombs. We're gonna need them.""

Frank: ""Oh, fuck Jim in the ass! This is gonna be a mess.""

Scott: ""Abaddon bombs spooling. Doug, get us a sample as quick as you can, I wanna know what variants we're dealing with.""
___
At my request the terrans turned off their orbital lasers attempting to kill the scourge below. They just get in the way now.

When he was sixty kilometers up, Doug's powered armor released a small payload that stayed in the upper atmosphere, waiting. Finneas' behind him did the same as he passed, and likewise with Scott and Frank. When all four were up there together, the devices they left merged into a single unit. 

Down below, Doug landed *on* a section of the scourge mass. His powered armor emitting a blast of destruction where it hit. He immediately started spraying his flamethrower in all directions. 

This wasn't any old regular flame thrower, this shit was a specially designed horror to fight a horror. It appeared to be a regular flaming liquid he was shooting all over, but inside, that liquid was devious nano-engineering. Horrifying little robots specifically tuned to take flesh and turn it into more bots, which is immediately also on fire. The botspray, their super space age napalm started being essentially 'on fire' the moment they touched oxygen. Great weapon for planets where humans might want to live, plenty of oxygen for them to burn off. They would eat and ignite any flesh they touched, scourge or otherwise, and replicate from it faster than they burned up. 

Some people, the guys who invented it, wanted to call the device the scourge unzipper, because it catalyses scourge cells to dissolves back into inert chemicals which are reassembled into bots that immediately 'burn' down to their lowest energy states as the bots encounter oxygen. The fact that for all intents and purposes it looked like a big ass fucking flamethrower made the name 'unzipper' never stick with any but the most pedantic science nerds. 

In Doug's armor's other hand was a sword, yes, a sword. It was a big fucking sword at least. Scourge liked to swing tentacles at things, and swords chop tentacles plenty good. Some guys use axes instead, for armored variants of scourge. This sword was also on fire. As every good purifier does, Doug had doused his blade in the unzipper liquid. The sword was also a sample collector, loaded up with sensors and science gadgetry.

Doug slashed a few tentacles as they came flying in toward him to attempt to stop him flame throwering all over the mass. 

""Processing samples now.""

""Impact in three, two, one."" Finneas landed and likewise starting in with the warcrimes weaponry. His variant of war crime was a viral agent that he had been found be generally effective on planetbound scourge masses. It wouldn't kill it outright, but it sure slowed down its grown a lot. He'd been spraying it from about five kilometers up, other than that he had the petajoule lightning (PJL) sweeper equipped to his suit. He started roasting back scourge mass like he was merely weed whacking with the finger of god. Finneas had an axe for each hand too if it came to that, but the PJL Sweeper was atomizing scourge flesh plenty good for now.

The Purifiers had a integrated computer systems, Doug didn't need to report the analysis reports, though his suit was the one doing the computing and analysis of the scourge flesh. He hacked a few more bits of it off for a few more samples. 

""Oh my, this strain is spicy."" Frank, the highest up was looking over the results as he plummeted from the sky. ""Got a lot of the latest updates from our front line, but not all of them, more dangerous in space, this type. It has those obnoxious armor genes, but can't express them here cause it hasn't found diamonds or a coal mine yet.""

""Let's Fucking GOOOO!!!"" Scott didn't count down his impact, he just impacted. He'd rigged his suit to intentionally leak unzipper fluid when he impacted, so that there would be a huge fireball of destroyed scourge flesh when he hit. The techs hated it, but it was effective. He burned through his fuel tank for his flamethrower before the mission was over almost every time he went out though. Fortunately there were always more weapons systems.

Frank landed last, and when he was down he said, ""Halo's ready boss. Seal us up""

And I did. The objects they'd left floating high orbit turned on, and a containment shell activated surrounding our boys on the ground, sealing them in with the scourge. They could actually get out if they wanted to, but the scourge would have a very hard time, especially with them stabbing, poisoning, and unzipping it. In there, the scourge mass was still covering the size of a small city. 

The battle inside took six hours. Chemical weapons, biological weapons, crazy advanced energy weapons and some good old fashioned brute force and eventually they'd killed it enough to plant and defend their Abaddon bombs long enough for them reach a full charge.

The *real* reason for the containment field was not the scourge, though it did have that effect as well, mostly. In truth it could break out if given enough time. Not while it was trapped in there with active, pissed off Purifiers going human all over it. No, the containment field was for what the Abaddon bombs were about to unleash. 

""It's fucking charged.""

""My shit too. You ready to fuck this scourge.""

""Aye, my shite's up and runnin lads, we should be too.""

""Mine's at a hundred now. Lets get the fuck out of here, ya hosiers. On the bounce!""

The four of them activated their jump packs and threw themselves clear of the containment field. Scourge tentacles whipped after them, but bounced off the containment walls. 

**Finally**, the only time I get to commit the war crimes. The system in the tablet showed all four men clear, so I pressed the shiny red 'Detonate' button that had appeared. 

In our study of the enfuckulators since Jim's sacrifice we had learned to open temporary portals to... *other places*. The science nerds don't like it when you call those places things like 'hell', or 'Cthulhu's grundle', but the term Abaddon bomb had stuck. 

You know that phrase 'fight fire with fire'?

Well humans figured fight horrifying fleshbeast with even more horrifying fleshbeast. The bombs ripped open a temporary portal to a plane of existence that, thus far, had always come with a screaming mess of even meaner tentacles than the Scourge. The Abaddon tentacles pulled everything they could get a hold of inside the rips before they closed. Those tentacles simply cannot continue to exist in our universe for very long. The laws of physics didn't like it. So whatever remained of the Abaddon creature in our universe as the rips close doesn't matter, it'll sizzle off soon enough, a day at most. A perfect planetary scalpel to excise the scourge. Each Purifier carried a single Abaddon bomb. Hopefully we wouldn't need more, because we barely got that mass as it was. 

The problem was if you didn't have a containment field up, the Abaddon creature would try pretty damn hard to pull in the entire surrounding landscape in too. As it was, when contained in a circular field like we'd done with the Halo, they tended to pull away about three to five hundred meters of the planet's crust, straight down. In this case, the entire scourge mass and good bit of what was once - 1500 years ago - a beautiful valley was erased. 

Yeah, sure there'd be some Terra quakes, small ones. Well worth it in the end.

I had kept the comm line open the entire time. While the operation was under way Dilt showed me to their control center. We used the old 'camera pointed directly at a screen' trick to display what my display was showing on their big screen. Now wasn't the time to hash out video codecs.

Apparently there *were* linguists listening. Human, and bug people ones. Krethellic, as it turns out they're called. I knew that... I swear I did, once. 

Just after we finished mopping up the small infestation they had, Dilt's people brought a device into the room, and proudly spoke into it. A moment later it spoke in Earthican. 

""We have made a shitass translator based on your dogshit combat comms. Is it fucking working.""

""Sokath! His eyes uncovered!"" I struggled not to laugh, ""But I think you've got a lot of the curse words accidentally added as connective words.""

""I fucking see.""

I gave my dadbod counterpart a thumbs up and told him, ""Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel.""

'This was a successful first contact, all is well between us.'

Then there was a klaxon, and a voice said something, which the device translated as, ""Fucking scourge biomass incoming.""

- I am not working for any company sir.     
+ Why? You didn't get a job on campus?

+ So what are you doing now?
- I am working freelance as a UI/UX designer and UX consultant.       
+ How do you get clients?       
- Most of my clients approach me through word of mouth but I have a fair share of them approach me after seeing my dribbble profile and instagram page.       
+ What software do you use?      
- (Answered).       
+ Walk us through the journey, from client approaching you to delivering the job.      
- (Answered).        
+ But this is a well paying field na? why are you coming to Banking?       
- (Explained its an uncertain field so managing expenses is difficult since income isn't fixed, there are periods of no work and extreme pressure, seeking clients is difficult in this competitive market, so its basically like running your own business and banking provides a stable platform + my parents have been pressurising me to go for a stable job).         
+ But even in bank, you will have to chase customer to fulfil targets? What will you do then?       
- ( Answered with emphasis on job stability and mental peace on assurance of a fixed income).

Also its origin is in China so that maybe a security threat).     
+ Yes, that is what i wanted to hear. So tell me some other chatbots.     
- chatgpt, googler assitant, siri, alexa.     
+ but they aren't chatbots?      
- yes sir, i think they are technically classified as AI assistants but they are basically an evolution on the idea of chatbot where they are able to answer your queries more effectively given their greater access and understanding of data.     
+ Really? ok. What is the difference between ai assitant and chatbots then?      
- (explained but he didnt seem satisfied, then he read me a description from the internet with technical terms, i said i was not aware of the terms and exact techicality of the parameters that seperate them, he said it was ok and then said he agreed ai assistants are just marketing gimmick and are glorified chatbots).     
+ what is the current version of Chat gpt.

+ What is a unicorn?      
- (this question was a bit of a doozy, i was thinking of the creature but then remembered the startups valuation thing) Sir , I am not exactly sure but when startups reach a certain size and valuation they are called unicorns, they are usually pioneers of their industry niche and have significant future growth projections. Not sure of the exact figure but it was probably 100M USD.     
+ ok.

I fell deeply for someone (27M) who respected me, encouraged my ambitions, and never crossed a boundary. We met only occasionally for coffee or lunch, but he became my safe place ‚Äî someone who made me feel seen and valued.

When I told my mom that I admired him and, if things worked out, I‚Äôd like to marry him someday, she said he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúone of us‚Äù and that his family background didn‚Äôt match ours. That sentence shattered me.

My younger sibling tracked my location and told my parents, and soon my extended family got involved. One evening, I was ambushed in my living room ‚Äî insulted, questioned, and shamed. My father stayed silent. They mocked him for not being wealthy and said extremely cruel things about my worth. Hearing that from my own family broke me.

What hurts the most is that if they truly believed he wasn‚Äôt right for me, my parents could have spoken to me privately. Instead, they dragged my personal life before extended family ‚Äî people I don‚Äôt owe an explanation to ‚Äî and made me feel powerless. They even talked about taking away my phone and sending me away somewhere to ‚Äúfix‚Äù me. I cried until I couldn‚Äôt breathe, and nobody seemed to care.

I know I did nothing wrong. I just loved someone from a different community ‚Äî someone kind and genuine. But my parents said their reputation mattered more than my happiness.

I feel hollow now, like the people who were supposed to protect me only wanted to control me. I can‚Äôt stop replaying that evening in my head ‚Äî the words, the silence, the shame. I‚Äôm trying to heal, but I don‚Äôt know where to start.

I understand that if these levels are reached today in the USA, with a larger debt (100% of GDP), this could have a catastrophic effect upon the economy/US dollar etc.

But my specific question is this....

Trump's tariffs create both fast inflation (coffee, tomato, lumber etc), but are also a ""rising tide"" of base inflation (ie, steel used in trucks raise prices on transportation, port fees crippling long-term supply, etc).

Are Trump's tariffs pushing the base-level of inflation rate higher, meaning, that inflation will get higher -- and stay there. Are we looking at years of 10%++ interest rates?

1o7dppz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEETsOver30/comments/1o7dppz/a_visit_to_the_barbershop/,A visit to the barbershop,"I am 30 and for the first time I actually went to a barber. 

It's a bit expensive and that's why I'd usually go to the cheapest places and I'd get a cheap looking haircut as a result. But this time I just decided to see if it would be worth it. 

The day before I told my parents I'm thinking of going to the barber and they scoffed, telling me it's getting cold outside why would I do that. I told them I can wear a hat. That moment reinforced to me how easily affected my mood can be by their feedback. At 30 you should have a say in what to wear, where to go, what to do, and here I am 30 being almost reprimanded like a child for deciding to do this basic thing. 

Today I woke up and made a call, got assigned to a barber and came 15 minutes earlier. The barber objectively looked like a man in his 40's. He greeted me when I came in and offered a coffee or tea, I politely refused. Then he jokingly asked maybe something stronger pointing to the bar. And I gave a laugh and said it's too early in the day for me. He had just finished a client before and so went out for a smoke. I just sat waiting. 

When the time came he invited me to take a seat, I showed a picture of what I was looking for and then he gave me some feedback of what would suit me. 

I was quite nervous, thinking do we small-talk, just getting inside my head too much. 

And then some back and forth about where we've been. What I do for a living, I lied and just mentioned my previous work place and that I moved back home from being abroad. Didn't want to go into the why I am unemployed. He said that he too had a similar experience and finally settled to move back home and pick up hairdressing as a profession. 

He even told me about his personal life, how a girl he was seeing for 4 years ended up leaving him for another and then came back but he refused to be with her. It felt like a therapy session, I didn't mind him sharing that stuff. I am mostly a listener either way, but it was strangely comforting talking with a man and hearing his life story. 

Either way at some point I mentioned I was 30 and he was flabbergasted, saying he'd have thought I'm in my early 20's. That's a big insecurity being around men when I feel like I look so out of place. 

He took about 50 minutes, felt oddly nice, I can see the allure of such places. It's really customer focused and you're made to feel welcome, which is how it's supposed to be, considering the price you pay for a service. After he was done I shook hands and told him it was  a pleasure to have met him and wished him the best. 

Went to a coffeeshop and got myself a cup of coffee and then went for a walk in the park nearby. It felt nice. 

Underneath it all there is a desire to be able to share a part of yourself, to communicate without judgment. 

I have avoided and shielded myself for so long that it feels like an alien adapting to a world that's happening outside your room. Naturally if you isolate it's hard to be out and about. And there's so much going on out there, but then you retreat in your room, pull the blinds and tell yourself -

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

I also like Asian women too please message me also! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all.

I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair.

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1o7do2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o7do2h/1_year_post_cholecystectomy_issues_with/,1 year post cholecystectomy issues with dizziness/tremors,"I‚Äôm 24F and about 120lbs, and had my gallbladder out last august due to gallbladder related symptoms (intense gallbladder attacks, constant nausea, rib and back pain) but NO gallstones or sludge were ever found, even after they took it out. But the surgery helped and everything has been perfectly fine‚Ä¶ until 2 weeks ago i had what felt like a gallbladder attack, worse than any i‚Äôve had before, so bad i could hardly breathe. 

Since then i have had a number of symptoms including: lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision, confusion/inability to think clearly, hand and body tremors, constipation, stomach pain, rib and back pain, indigestion. NOTHING relieves my symptoms, it is difficult to drive and I am unable to work now and am being forced to take a medical leave from my job. though i have seen doctors, they have not been helpful and have not listened to me and I still have no answers. I‚Äôm hoping someone just has any idea of even a direction to go in, as I‚Äôm completely lost and on my own.

Keep in mind that all of these symptoms started suddenly that day, with no change in diet, medication, or sleep habits. And i had not eaten anything to trigger that ‚Äúgallbladder attack‚Äù, it was around noon and i had skipped breakfast to go to an appointment. I have had a few tests since this started and nearly everything has come back normal (anything abnormal has not been addressed by my doctors, like slightly high AST and CO2). 

I did have really low blood glucose (48) an hour or two after i had a sweet coffee and bagel bites, but i have continued testing my blood sugar regularly and it has always been normal, i have not seen it below 70 since then. My doctor seems to think all my symptoms are insulin/blood sugar related even though i have said that my symptoms are not better when my blood sugar is normal. I have a referral to endocrinology in january but i cannot wait that long for answers or relief.

I had a CT scan that found 2 things: constipation and a ruptured ovarian cyst. my doctor said to take miralax and do nothing about the cyst even though the CT results recommended an ultrasound follow up. I may not have ovarian cyst symptoms (my abdominal pain is higher up in the stomach/ribs) but an ultrasound would be helpful to look closer at everything. And though constipation can cause abdominal pain, i would consider it a symptom more than a cause- since having no gallbladder, my stools are runny and more yellow and have been so consistently for a YEAR until now. 

So I‚Äôm frustrated with my doctors for seemingly not trying or caring, because i know something is really really wrong with my body AND mind and they are just not taking me seriously. I have said that there is no relief and they just say to drink more water. 

I have a good number of questions but the main one is: what could cause all these symptoms as suddenly as they appeared? why does it feel like my body just shut down one day and nothing is helping?

sorry for the long post, i have a lot going on and i would appreciate any help or just reassurance that I‚Äôm not crazy",1,1760541039.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

This kid was neighbour of mine. 

And let me say my dad is brown and mom's got this peach skin same as my elder brother and I got my dad's melanin count because yea hes my dad. 

Either way my parents never told me anything bout my skin tone or anything but they were only  concious that none of me or my siblings should put on over weight as it's bad for our health and that's the only thing my parents ever cared bout. Health first over any thing and never knew skin tone was big thing because I recall getting 2 proposals at that age and I never cared.

 Coming back to this one day while I was 13 this girl was at our house frequently, she was 3-4 of age. She had a not peach not brown skin tone. Somewhere mid.

Anyhow once my mom offered her coffee while she was at our house and she went like 'I don't drink coffee' and my thought went to kids parents got brain, they ain't letting her use caffine and that's good. Now comes the best part, and she continues saying ""mamma told if I drink coffee I'll become black like didi"" GURLü§© LIKE?

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I have been a Browns fan for my entire life. I‚Äôm 34 years old. I love all Cleveland sports. And while I realize I‚Äôm relatively young in the grand scheme of things, I have seen a lot. I‚Äôve had relationships, jobs, heartbreaks, cars‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll tell you one thing I‚Äôve never seen in my lifetime. 

A functional Browns team. 

Year after year I voluntarily subject myself to the torture and emotional waterboarding that is the Cleveland Browns. 

At this point I think the solution is simple. Let‚Äôs hire a fan. Just once. I‚Äôm serious. Give us the damn keys. Let one of us get in there and take over for a season. It can‚Äôt possibly go worse. 

Think about it:

I‚Äôve been watching this team eff it all up for practically my entire conscience life. I know the mistakes so well I could write a book about it. Courtney Brown, Brady Quinn, Kellen Winslow, Trent Richardson, Gerard Warren‚Ä¶need I go on? 

And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm the only one. Any serious Browns fan has pretty much earned their honorary degree in ‚ÄúFranchise Mismanagement‚Äù. Jimmy Haslam could call just about any random season ticket holder and probably have a better 5-year plan for the team than what he‚Äôs got before finishing a cup of coffee. 

I‚Äôm literally not joking around. I think they should just go out to the Muni lot one gameday afternoon, randomly pick somebody, give em a headset, and run it. Let‚Äôs just see what happens. And not just a coach. All of it. Get rid of em all. Fan coach, Fan GM, Fan Head of Football operations. 

You‚Äôd at least have: 

1. Drafts and trades that make basic sense 
2. Coaches that want to win and don‚Äôt say ‚Äúwe have to do better‚Äù after every game
3. And staff that know what it means to love Cleveland sports 

And if it fails? No problem. But at least we had purpose. We had a vision. 

Why am I suggesting this? Because I‚Äôve never seen fans who dedicate themselves to a team more than ours. Imagine what we could do for the actual team! 

Because you know damn good and well that every orange blooded Browns fan thinks the same thing‚Ä¶

We could fix this. We could run it better. We would fight to win. 

So let‚Äôs do it. Find a dawg and get em out the pound and put em on the sideline.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I want to stop.","I've (21F) realised that for a while I've been subconsciously and consciously comparing myself to non black people.

Especially, in areas like friends, relationships/ just life in general. My life isn't where I really want it to be. I find myself thinking, would my life be different if I weren't black? I was very shy and quiet, and it bothered people, but some white girls were quiet, and they didn't get any crap for it. I was also the only Black girl in my friend group. When I scroll through Instagram and see people that I know with their big friend groups going on holiday, or their relationships, there's always a nagging feeling in my brain. If I weren't black, would I have the life they have?

I deleted Hinge after a year, and I realised that I only went on one proper date, and it was just a coffee date. I mostly attracted men who would either ghost after a while or only wanted sex. Hearing white people talk about their hundreds of likes, many matches, and their proper dates made me realise our worlds are different. I also graduated from university with no relationship experience, the place where everyone tells you, you will find someone. So now I feel like the relationship department is nonexistent.

Also, I feel like there's not a lot of black spaces where I live. My friends and I at university were in a city that was mostly white and asian. We talked about how non black people in our area have loads of social events to go to. The white people had pubs and weekly university club events that catered to them. The south asian people had weekly club events. Us black people had a crap club or big events that happened once every couple of months. The number of club events or day parties didn't feel like it fostered a community of sorts. The Black community events in my city are for older Black people, ""creatives"", or roller skating.

The thing is, I love being black, my culture, and everything that comes with it. I hate that I'm reducing some of the ""bad"" things in my life due to my race. I don't hate being black. I hate how the world might be treating me because I'm Black.",3,1760539478.0,blackgirls,6,0.81,False

We recently spent 5 unforgettable nights at The Ranch at Rock Creek with our family of five (my wife and I, plus our three kids, aged 7, 10 & 12), and I can honestly say it exceeded every expectation, and may indeed be the best family trip we have ever taken. From the moment we arrived (and in fact, even the pre-arrival communication to set everything up) to the day we (reluctantly) left, every element of the stay was marked by luxury, warm hospitality, and world-class service. This was not just a vacation spot, it‚Äôs an experience in every sense of the word.

First, let me start off by saying that I began researching this type of family vacation nearly 2 years ago. My initial search started with numerous places including (among others) Rawah Ranch, C Lazy U Ranch and Paws Up. In fact, I was in the process of booking Paws Up until I came across a number of concerning reviews here on reddit & elsewhere, which gave me pause, due to a consistent theme of lack of service and/or poor communication. I cannot comment on actual experiences at Paws Up or anywhere else, and maybe what I read online were isolated issues, but what I can say is that it was enough to make me want to look elsewhere before dropping close to $40k on a family vacation. I happened to stumble upon a couple of glowing reviews for The Ranch at Rock Creek and thus, its where I ultimately settled on going with the family.

About 30-45 days out, we were contacted by their pre-arrival concierge team, and immediately from that point forward, I knew we were in good hands. Jessie and the entire team were very responsive and helpful in guiding us to create the perfect itinerary for our family. Across a number of emails and phone calls, they thoughtfully provided detailed responses to every question I had. We coordinated flights & airport transfer, all our daily activities, and specific meals (we have some dietary restrictions as we keep some level of Kosher). We ended up shipping our own beef/chicken, etc. in advance of our arrival, and coordination with the culinary team via email was perfect. The instructions we provided were followed exactly and every meal at the property was delicious.

We stayed in one of the family tents, specifically, Cutbow, and it was breathtaking by the creek. The decor strikes a beautiful balance between Western charm and sophisticated comfort. Think of lots of warm wood, plush bedding in a spacious and well laid out canvas tent, kept warm with 2 gas fireplaces. While it was very clean, its of course a tent on a ranch, so if you are thinking of ultra-high-end SE Asia or Europe hotels luxury, or zero bugs, you simply don‚Äôt have the right expectations.

I loved sitting on the porch outside in the morning with a coffee and literally watching a family of deer stroll by (happened almost daily). Our kids were thrilled about having their own beds, including the pull-out sofa which was shockingly comfortable for our 7 year old. Housekeeping was impeccable, and our room was refreshed multiple times a day with fresh towels, turn-down treats, and warm touches that made it feel more like a private home. Anything we needed (including extra waters), was a simple call away and delivered expeditiously.

Huge shoutout to Chef Jack, as the culinary program here is spectacular. Every meal, from hearty breakfasts to gourmet dinners, was crafted with care, creativity, and local ingredients. Anything we wanted to customize: the answer was always ‚Äúyes.‚Äù As mentioned before, for some of our meals (specifically dinners) we shipped our own food due to our Kosher dietary requirements, and provided instructions, and with that said, the variety was impressive: elevated ranch-style fare, fresh seafood, vegetarian options, and non-junk food kids' meals.

In the evenings, my wife and I enjoyed craft cocktails by the fire at Granite Lodge, and it provided a quiet space for me to (sadly) get a little work done, while the kids made s‚Äômores outside (perhaps too many). Overall, the rotating menu never felt repetitive across our stay. The service staff was friendly, attentive, and seemed genuinely happy to be there, something that‚Äôs not always easy to find, especially when many hires are going to be seasonal simply by nature of the operations. One thing that‚Äôs maybe a little underrated is that this isn‚Äôt a huge property in terms of number of rooms. I think one of the staff mentioned max occupancy is under 125 guests. With that in mind, the fact that they have more than just 1 on-site restaurant was appreciated so that we weren‚Äôt having 3 meals a day in the same spot.

Silver Dollar Saloon after dinner each night was fun too. Bowling, billiards, darts (my son became quite the marksman!) and just hanging out and watching a movie or teaching my younger kids chess & checkers to end the night was perfect.

Of course, where The Ranch at Rock Creek truly shines is in the sheer variety and quality of activities, all expertly guided and seamlessly organized. Fly fishing in the middle of the creek (a first for all of us, and my kids caught some trout!), horseback riding through the hills, the cool archery course, sapphire mining, the rifle range (Rimfire), clay shooting, biking, hiking, ATV tour (hi elk and big horn sheep!), you name it, we did it. The kids Flints Forest Ranger program was awesome and allowed my wife and I just a bit of alone time. Everything is included, it really felt like the staff went above and beyond to personalize every outing, and we were able to make some adjustments on the fly (such as a second trail ride) as well. Every team member we interacted with was friendly, knowledgeable, and great with kids.

There were a few things we didn‚Äôt do, so I can‚Äôt comment on: spa, pool (too cold in October, it lightly snowed our last day there!), the ropes course, and maybe a couple of other activities we just didn‚Äôt have time for, but everything we prioritized, we were able to enjoy.

I know I already mentioned this above, but what genuinely sets The Ranch at Rock Creek apart is the people. Without exception, every single staff member we encountered, from the wranglers and guides to the dining staff and housekeepers, to our drivers and the front desk staff, was warm, helpful, and deeply committed to making our stay exceptional. They remembered our names which was crazy remarkable, our preferences, and even the kids‚Äô favorite activities. Service was anticipatory without being intrusive, and everything felt both polished and personal. This isn‚Äôt easy when you have a staff of over 100 to not have a few that are there ‚Äòjust to collect a paycheck‚Äô type of mentality. So I have to applaud management & ownership on the training program they have in place. Then, one morning at breakfast, we had the pleasure of meeting Jim, the owner, and I was able to have a really interesting 20-30 minute chat with him and learned about his 20+ year quest & vision of finding and building the perfect place to create this implausible, warm and friendly atmosphere, and share it with not just his own family and friends but opening it up to visitors to experience. Its just not something that is easily achieved (or sustained), but he‚Äôs managed to accomplish it because he truly cares so much and it shows‚Ä¶ his passion is what has set the tone for making this place so special.

Any issues/concerns were addressed immediately. The best examples being that the bicycle for my eldest daughter was too small and it was swapped out within 15 minutes with a larger one, and mid-trip my sons bicycle had an issue with the rear wheel getting stuck, and again within 30 minutes it was fixed (they literally sent a vehicle to our tent, picked it up, fixed it, brought it back to our tent).

This is getting ridiculously long so I‚Äôll end with my final thoughts: The Ranch at Rock Creek isn‚Äôt just a vacation. For the 5 of us, it was a rare kind of experience that brought our family closer together while giving everyone space to grow by trying new things, relax, and have fun. Perfect example: On day 1, my 7 year old son wouldn‚Äôt bike without one of his older sisters with him and not more than a few hundred feet away from us. By check-out, he was half a mile away, on his own, and we had to chase him down to leave. Yes, it‚Äôs a luxury property, and it costs a pretty penny, but the value you get in return isn‚Äôt calculable by dollars and cents. Unlimited activities, gourmet meals, personalized service, and most of all, creating core memories to last a lifetime. It was worth every single cent.

We left feeling deeply fortunate and grateful for the time we spent there and are already dreaming about a future trip back, hopefully in a few years. If you're looking for a truly all-inclusive, FAT / luxury Western escape that caters to both adults and kids, this is it.",8,1760539417.0,chubbytravel,6,0.9,False

1o7cwzg,https://i.redd.it/d2ykco4bfavf1.jpeg,"My apple ecosystem, and advice what you really need, what not","Hey guys, I want to share my simple experience with apple stuff. Maybe help someone. Not a pro review, just how I use it in real life.

My setup now:

MacBook M3 Max 36GB / 1TB, 14 inch

iPhone 14 Pro 512GB

Apple Watch Series 10

AirPods Pro 2 (two pairs)

AirPods Max

Magic Keyboard

First, things I think you probably don‚Äôt need (for me):

AirPods Max ‚Äî sound is good and noise cancellation is good, but they are big and heavy. After a long time, my head start hurting because the clamp is strong and it feels heavy. Ear cushions get dirty very fast. If you wash, still look bad. The real fix is buy new cushions for $69. Headband mesh also collects dirt and starts to sag. after months, I just use airpods pro 2. they do all I need and no headache.

apple watch ‚Äî I used it before, it is comfortable and nice for sport and daily life, you see notifications and control some apps. But I switched to garmin fenix 7 pro solar. apple watch series 10 from box lives 1‚Äì2 days for me. garmin goes 20+ days (with trainings around 15+). too big difference. if you are ok to charge every day, like when you shower before sleep, apple watch is great. But I forget to charge, so I lose sleep track and sometimes go out with a dead watch

Now, things I think most people should have:

MacBook ‚Äî best laptop in my life. Even before M chips, I liked mac, but with M it is a small monster for work. Small advice: buy more RAM. I had M1 8GB before. ok for simple things, but with browser 10+ tabs and some heavy apps it feels bad. if your work is websites and spreadsheets, 16GB is fine. if figma or heavier, better take more. You cannot upgrade RAM later, so think about the future. about size: if you use an external monitor at home and carry a laptop outside, 14 inch is perfect. lighter and easier in a coffee shop. if you use only a laptop screen at home, 16 inch screen makes sense.

iPhone ‚Äî best match with mac. many small features (copy paste sync, airdrop, messages) make life easier. Take a model you like. if you shoot many photos and keep them on your phone, don‚Äôt save money on storage. You will be happy later.

accessories:

magic mouse ‚Äî for me, not good. Not comfortable to hold, charging is annoying. I don‚Äôt understand why it is like this.

magic keyboard ‚Äî good keyboard, I like it. But I use macbook touchpad a lot, so many times I just use the built-in keyboard and trackpad.

That‚Äôs it. Hope it helps someone. Tell me your setup and what you like or not",8,1760539375.0,macbook,5,1.0,False

Last month, she sent an email to my boss saying I‚Äôd been ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù because I supposedly took a long lunch. My boss checked the logs and saw that I had actually been covering for her while she ran errands. She got a quiet warning for lying.

Ever since, she‚Äôs been acting overly nice, complimenting my work, bringing me coffee, etc. This week, she asked if I could let her ‚Äúshadow‚Äù me for a few days to ‚Äúlearn how I manage scheduling.‚Äù My boss approved it if I was comfortable with it.

I said no. I told my boss that given what happened before, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing my workflow with someone who had tried to get me written up. Becky overheard and said I was being ‚Äúspiteful‚Äù and ‚Äúblocking her professional growth.‚Äù

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

We‚Äôve broken up before though and I‚Äôm fully anticipating him to tell me how much he‚Äôs changed and that he‚Äôs sorry and how he can‚Äôt be happy without me. I love him but I was making myself ill when we were together, the day it went down I thought I was having a heart attack (I‚Äôm in my mid 20s). 

Does anyone have any advice to stay steadfast in your choices once you‚Äôve decided to end things with someone you care about? It is for the best, the relationship was riddled with problems but we spent so long together and had some really good times for a while I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be reeled back in (although I can‚Äôt tell how differently I‚Äôll feel in a few months).

1o7cp74,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1o7cp74/explore_if_bissell_pet_lifting_pads_really_remove/,Explore if Bissell Pet Lifting Pads Really Remove Carpet Stains,"Testing the Bissell Stomp 'N Go Pet Lifting Pads (model 2194) made me question how I ever managed pet messes before. Life with a gaggle of pets means dealing with stains that have the audacity to set in and linger, so a product promising to tackle everything from wine to muddy paw prints piqued my interest right away. I'll admit, I was skeptical at first‚Äîstain lifting pads that you *stomp* on to clean? It sounded too good to be true. But after weeks of use, it‚Äôs safe to say there‚Äôs a lot to love here, though a few quirks surfaced as well.

**Usability in Everyday Life**

The concept couldn‚Äôt be simpler. You place the pad over the stain, stomp on it to release the cleaning solution, and then just wait for the magic to happen. As a dog owner and part-time cat wrangler, this no-touch cleaning method felt like a godsend. Gone are the days of scrubbing mysterious blotches with gloved hands and futile sprays. For tougher or older stains, leaving the pad in place for several hours or overnight worked wonders. This came in particularly handy after my feisty Labrador decided the living room carpet was his canvas post-muddy walk. To my surprise, the stubborn dark patch vanished without much effort.

**Effectiveness on Different Stains**

Testing it against an array of offenders‚Äîcoffee spills, pet accidents, and random food smears‚Äîshowed just how versatile these lifting pads are. Honestly, it felt a bit like watching a magic trick. The formula did an admirable job breaking down tough stains like wine and cola, which usually require more effort. However, it's worth pointing out that for larger or deeply ingrained messes, you might need to use two or more pads to cover the entire area, which can feel slightly less efficient.

**Perks**

- Extremely easy setup, no assembling or battery fuss.
- Works on multiple surfaces including rugs, carpets, pet beds, and car interiors.
- Leaves a subtle wildflower scent that‚Äôs not overpowering; my usually sensitive nose appreciated this detail.
- Pet-friendly both literally and figuratively‚Äîevery purchase supports the BISSELL Pet Foundation, a meaningful touch for animal lovers.
- Handy 20-pack inclusion ensures you‚Äôre prepared for multiple incidents without constantly restocking.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Pads are relatively small (4 inches by 8.25 inches), so they can feel inadequate for larger messes.
- While the ""set it and forget it"" method is great, stains requiring multiple hours of treatment aren't ideal if guests are over.
- Not a true eco-friendly product since the pads are disposable and add to waste.

**Design and Packaging**

At 6.25 x 10 x 7.25 inches, the box fits comfortably in a cabinet or utility closet, which I find convenient given my tendency to stash cleaning products wherever there‚Äôs space. The pads are neatly stacked and easy to pull out one at a time. Their compact size and lightweight design make them travel-friendly, too. I‚Äôve even tossed a few in my car for those unpredictable mini-disasters while driving with the gang in tow.

**Winning Points**

- The pad‚Äôs ability to tackle a broad range of stains‚Äîthink blood, juice, and even pet-related surprises‚Äîis exceptional.
- Wildflower-scented formula keeps your space smelling fresh without overpowering odors.
- The pet foundation support adds a feel-good element to the purchase.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Larger pads or a new option for different-sized stains could improve usability, especially for those dealing with extensive messes.
- More detailed instructions or tips on combating specific kinds of stains might help users make the most of the product.
- Although convenient, the single-use nature might deter eco-conscious buyers seeking sustainable options.

**Competing Products**

Putting this product side by side with carpet stain sprays or traditional cleaners was quite enlightening. Spray-based options, while versatile, require scrubbing or blotting, which isn‚Äôt exactly mess-free. Products like Resolve or Folex excel with tough stains too, but they demand time and effort you might not have after a long day. The stomp-and-go method of this product saves you from all of that hassle. That said, cost-per-pad can be a factor, especially against bulk cleaning supplies or reusable alternatives.

**Value for Money**

For anyone balancing multiple pets or kids (or both‚Äîthey seem to have the same knack for finding mud, honestly), investing in stress-free stain removal is a no-brainer. Although single-use products might seem like a continual cost, the sheer convenience and efficiency make these pads worthwhile for busy families. No assembly required, no batteries to worry about, just stomp and exhale. Plus, having used comparable products that still left faint traces of stains behind, these were impressive in terms of delivering consistent cleaning results. They might not be the most budget-friendly option, but when the trade-off is peace of mind, it feels justifiable.

I posted one of those, ""Laid off and looking for new opportunities"" posts on LinkedIn.

2. **Startup**. Someone I know contacted me to meet for a coffee. We sat down and he gave me a full demo of the product he has been working on with a small team (6 people, of which I know 3 personally). They have pilot partners and a waitlist for partners to use their product.

My name is Roel, and I‚Äôm the developer behind Urban Rider. This isn't just another app launch post; it's the story of a passion project born from a moment of pure panic that I‚Äôm sure many of you have felt.

**TL;DR:** As a scooter rider, I was fed up with navigation apps trying to kill me by routing me onto highways. I decided to build my own app, **Urban Rider**. We launched it way too early to see if there was demand, got absolutely roasted in the reviews for being buggy and basic, and then used that ""hate"" as our exact roadmap. We kept building, listening, and iterating. Today, Urban Rider is an extremely powerful and configurable navigation app for scooters, mopeds, and all two-wheelers, with features like ""Urban Canyon Proof"" GPS that works between skyscrapers and a new beta for hyper-accurate battery range estimates. It's been a wild journey, and I wanted to share it with you.

# The ""Moment of Panic"" That Started It All

Every scooter and moped rider knows the feeling. You're cruising through the city, enjoying the ride, and your GPS confidently says, ""Turn right in 200 feet."" You make the turn, and suddenly you're staring down an on-ramp to a four-lane, 65 mph highway. Your heart sinks. The wind blast from passing trucks feels like a physical blow. You're gripping the handlebars, a 30 mph vehicle in a river of steel, all because an app designed for cars thinks your moped is a sedan.¬†

That moment of panic is where Urban Rider began. Living and riding in Berlin, a city with incredible micro-mobility, I was constantly fighting with Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. They're brilliant for cars, but for two-wheelers, they're clueless at best and dangerous at worst. They don't understand that a ""shortcut"" for a car can be a death trap for a scooter. They don't care about steep hills that drain your e-scooter's battery or roads with terrifying traffic speeds. I wasn't a big company; I was just a developer with a scooter who knew there had to be a better way. So, fueled by way too much coffee, I started building it myself.¬†

# The Crucible: We Launched Too Early and Got Roasted (On Purpose)

Here‚Äôs where the ""love and hate"" part of our story comes in. We knew our first version wasn't perfect. We knew it was basic. But we faced a choice: spend another month building in a vacuum, guessing what riders wanted, or release a bare-bones version to see if people *actually* cared about the core problem we were trying to solve.

We chose to launch and learn. It was a calculated risk, and honestly, it was brutal.The initial reviews were‚Ä¶ rough. People were frustrated. But amidst the criticism, there was a glimmer of hope: people *were* downloading it. They *did* want a solution. The demand was real. ¬†

So, we made a promise: we would listen to every single piece of feedback and build the app our community wanted. The negative reviews became our bible, our roadmap. Your ""hate"" literally built our app.

Here‚Äôs a little ""You Said, We Did"" from our early days:

>

You were 100% right. It drove us crazy too. So we didn't just patch it; we completely overhauled our trip preview panel and routing engine to be faster and more [intuitive.Now](http://intuitive.Now) you can see everything at a glance. ¬†

>

This was one of our most requested features. We heard you loud and clear. Now, you just long-press anywhere on the map to set your destination. Done. That feature exists because of you.¬†

>

We were aware of this and obsessed over it. We've been continuously refining our map-tracking experience to be smoother and more fluid, and we're still working on making it even better. Your feedback on this guides every update.¬†

>

This is a tricky algorithmic balance between finding the ""safest"" road and the most ""sensible"" route. We are constantly fine-tuning our routing engine to minimize these pointless turns while still prioritizing low-stress streets. Your examples helped us squash so many of these.¬†

This process of co-creation is the soul of Urban Rider. The early bugs and missing features weren't just failures; they were the foundation of a conversation between us and our users. You helped us build this, and we're still listening.

# The Revelation: The Powerhouse App You See Today

After years of this iterative process, Urban Rider has evolved from a simple ""highway avoider"" into a deeply sophisticated navigation tool. We didn't just fix the bugs; we went back to first principles to solve problems that other apps don't even know exist for riders.

# Beyond ""Avoid Highways"": The Art of the Perfect Route

""Avoiding highways"" is just the start. Our core promise is finding the *best* path for a two-wheeler. Our smart algorithm creates routes exclusively on roads suitable for vehicles in the 25-50 km/h (15-31 mph) range. But it goes deeper. We prioritize: ¬†

* **Low-Stress Streets:** Finding the clever side streets and scenic routes that car maps ignore.¬†
* **Intelligent Elevation Analysis:** We consider hill inclines, a critical factor for electric scooters and mopeds to avoid draining their battery on an unexpectedly steep hill.¬†
* **Accurate ETAs:** Our arrival times are calculated based on real-world scooter speeds, not unrealistic car estimates, so you can actually plan your day.¬†

# Deep Tech Explained: Our ""Urban Canyon Proof"" GPS

Ever had your GPS dot freeze and then jump three blocks in the middle of downtown? That's because your phone lost signal in an ""urban canyon"" between tall buildings. Standard GPS apps rely heavily on cell tower data, which is notoriously unreliable in dense cityscapes.¬†

We became obsessed with solving this. Urban Rider uses a multi-layered system that car-centric apps don't:

1. **Intelligent Sensor Fusion:** We combine raw GPS data with your phone's other sensors (like the accelerometer and gyroscope) to maintain a more accurate and continuous position estimate.¬†
2. **Advanced Dead Reckoning:** When the GPS signal drops completely (like under a bridge or in a tunnel), we don't just give up. Our system intelligently predicts your movement based on your last known velocity and direction, keeping you on track through the gaps.¬†
3. **Contextual Map Intelligence:** Our app ""snaps"" your predicted position to the road, preventing the blue dot from drifting into buildings and triggering false ""off-route"" alerts.¬†

The result? The blue dot stays locked on, smooth as silk, even between the tallest skyscrapers. It‚Äôs a difference you can feel.

# The Future is Here: Unleash Your True Battery Range (Beta)

This is our latest and most ambitious feature, and it's something we're incredibly excited about. We're tired of EV range estimates that are just vague guesses. So, in our latest beta, we're giving you something no one else has: a range prediction you can finally trust.¬†

You can now create a custom profile for your *exact* ride. Input its battery specs **Voltage (V), Amp-hours (Ah), and average consumption (Wh/km)**. Urban Rider will then show you a dynamic range circle on the map that truly reflects what *your* specific vehicle can do. This works for any electric scooter or moped, from a Xiaomi or Segway to a Niu or Unu.¬†

No more guessing. No more range anxiety. This is the ultimate expression of our ""Your Ride, Your Rules"" philosophy.

# How We Stack Up

We built Urban Rider because the big players weren't serving our community. Here‚Äôs a quick, honest look at how we compare:

|**EV Features**|Generic EV charging stations|Avoids steep hills|**Hyper-Personalized.** Beta for true battery range estimate based on V, Ah, Wh/km|
|**Development Status**|Actively developed (for cars)|Seemingly abandoned by developers, no support mentioned by users|**Actively developed & community-driven.** Constant updates based on your feedback|

# The Call to Adventure (And the Android Question)

If you‚Äôve ever felt that moment of panic on an on-ramp, or just wished for a GPS that understood your two-wheeled life, I‚Äôd be honored if you gave Urban Rider a try. It‚Äôs our way of helping you reclaim your city, transforming your commute from a chore into a joyride.

**You can download it on the App Store here:** ([https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scooter-navigation-urban-ride/id6746205274?l=en-GB](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scooter-navigation-urban-ride/id6746205274?l=en-GB))

We have a **7-day free trial** so you can see for yourself if it makes your rides better.¬†

**For all the Android riders asking:** Yes, an Android version is **100% being built**. To be super transparent, we are taking all the hard lessons we learned from our early iOS launch to build the native Android app from the ground up. Our goal isn't just to port it, but to launch a fast, reliable, and rock-solid app that feels amazing from day one. It's still a little ways off, but if you want to follow our progress and be first in line for the closed beta, please join our community at r/urbanriders.¬†

# Ask Me Anything

This has been our journey so far, and it's been a wild ride. We're a small, passionate team, and we're incredibly proud of where we are, but we know we're not done. We built this for riders like you, and we'll be hanging out in the comments all day to answer any questions you have.

What do you think? What's the first multi-stop trip you'd plan? What should we build next?

### Background
I ran my first marathon in 2012 and, for the most part, have been navigating life and whittling down my PR over the past 12 years. Twice, I've run Chicago and each time had great times (3:09 in 2017 and 3:00:14 in 2023).

Having just barely missed my sub-3:00 goal in Chicago '23, I felt like I was certainly capable of giving it another go. I somehow got into the 2024 Tokyo Marathon via the lottery and had an amazing experience despite blowing up again in which I ran a 1:28:xx first half followed by a 1:36:xx second half. Oh, it also turns out that I got COVID on the trip and was starting to feel sick mid-race, so I'm not too hard on myself about that one.

Next up was Houston 2025, which I've chronicled extensively via my [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1i5ptss/houston_marathon_sub300_mission_fail/), but tl;dr: I didn't feel strong from the jump and never was able to run with the 3:00 pace group. I enjoyed the heck out of the race, though, and came away with a smile on my face. I knew that for my next race I'd need a stronger foundation, likely with more volume, strength training, and PT.

To try and give myself the best chance at my sub-3:00, I picked Chicago as my next full given how much success I'd had there before and how much I love the city and the race.

### Training
Leading up to and during the Houston Marathon, I felt extra tightness in my hamstrings and after the race itself I felt some new pain there so I took it easy in the following weeks and started going to physical therapy more. It turns out I'm a pretty heavy overstrider and heel-striker (I know people like to rail on my kind here on Reddit) and it was leading to extra burden on my hammies and a pretty low cadence. To relieve some of the tension on my hamstrings, I worked on cadence training a bit in PT but, of course in the process, ended up getting pain in my plantar fascia. Eventually, the hamstrings cooled off and the PF discomfort became manageable.

As for training itself, I started working with a buddy/coach and we settled on, in total, a 20-week build that'd peak at 63 miles with an average of about 54 miles per week -- an improvement over my 12-week Houston build that peaked at 56 miles with an average of 47. Having heard about my implosions mid-race, my coach definitely wanted to focus on more volume and more race pace stretches during long runs. 

In my build, I felt I had a number of encouraging workouts and long runs where I was holding 6:40-6:50 pace for longer stretches of time, but also had a handful of times where I adjusted pace due to the hot summer we ended up having. 

As a tune-up race, I ran a 1:28:28 half last month that I knew wasn't going to correlate to a sub-3:00, but I was at least pleased with the effort and hopeful that it might all come together with the right conditions.

Giving me some confidence, at least, thought I nailed the last couple of prescribed workouts and long runs going into the taper, including:
*long run: 18-mile progression down to 7:00ish min/miles
*tempo workout: 14x400 averaging 6:20's w/ 8:00 floats
*tempo workout: 2mi averaging 6:42 + 4x1K averaging 6:25

I was happy to have survived the 20-week build without getting super sick (that usually happens at least once or twice as we have two kids in elementary school) or reinjuring myself. My heel often hurt after speed work, but tended to subside the next day or so.

All in all, I was eager to give it a go in Chicago with 2:59:59 in the crosshairs.

### Pre-race
My wife and I flew out to Chicago on Friday morning and we went straight to the expo to get my bib before hitting up dim sum in Chinatown. We then went to our friends' place to relax for a bit, followed by a great dinner and drinks (I had an NA beer or two).

Saturday, I took the L down to hit up the Believe in the Run shakeout and after getting my three miles and a t-shirt, I trained back north to our HQ for the weekend to get horizontal for the rest of the day. We took it super easy and had subs for lunch and pasta for dinner.

I was tracking my carbload and made sure to get about 650-700 grams of carbs Thursday through Saturday. With help from a Cherribundi pouch, I was able to get to sleep before 10 p.m. and woke up around 4 a.m. Sunday morning. Six hours of sleep the night before the race? What a treat.

Sunday morning I had coffee, a bagel, and 16 ounces of my LMNT/RNWY mix (can you tell I'm a Fuel for the Sole dude?) and headed out by 5:15 a.m. to catch the Red line downtown.

On the training and before getting through security at Grant Park, I had a pre-mixed Maurten 320 drink, too. I made sure to get through security with enough time to go to the bathroom once or twice, drop off my bag, and do some dynamic stretches. I even brought an exercise band with me to do some side-steps, per the recommendation of my physical therapist.

Eventually, I maneuvered into the C corral and got in the pack a few rows behind the 3:00 pace group. Though I was placed in the B group, I wanted to try and stick with the 3:00 pacers to take as much decision making out of my hands and just flow state all the way to a 2:59:59. I made a friend with the runner next to me at the start line who was from Germany and encouraged me to register for the Berlin Marathon. TBD on that, though.

After some more fanfare and my first AMACX turbo gel (plan was to have one at the start, followed by one every three miles or so, alternating caffeinated and regular), it was finally time to start and off we went.

### Race
In Houston, I pretty much felt challenged at sub-7:00 pace from the jump and was never able to catch the 3:00 pace group. When the gun went off in Chicago, I made sure to keep the pacers within sight and I tried to settle in to race pace with relative ease. As someone that loves and is energized by the crowds, the first nine miles felt great all things considered. Though my watch was hitting my mileage earlier and earlier than the actual mile markers, I managed to hit respectable splits at 5K (21:10), 10K (42:38), and 15K (1:03:40).

At this point, the 3:00 pace group was still right around me I think but I could start to tell I was losing a bit of steam each mile. I hit the half marathon mark in 1:30:11, which was slightly slower than my goal of 1:29:30-1:30:00, but I also had previous races where I went 1:28-1:29 in the first half and blew up hard in the second. 

Somewhere around here, I also witnessed and partially broke up a fight between two runners as one slowed down at an inopportune time and the runner behind nudged him. The one who was nudged then proceeded to literally go out of his way to then retaliate and push back the other runner. This all happened right in front of me so I sped up a step to verbally break them up and say that it wasn‚Äôt worth it for either party. It felt extra crowded on the course in general and there were a handful of times that I bumped into someone or had to slow down half a stride to avoid getting spiked, but I‚Äôve never seen an actual physical altercation like I did just then.

Any realistic chances of nabbing an elusive negative split went out the window, though, as I continued on and hit a 7:10 mile at mile 16. Keep in mind that my auto-laps were going off earlier and earlier, so I was probably closer to a 7:20-7:30 lap at that point. 

What was presumed to be the case earlier in the race became crystal clear as we hit the west side turnaround. My pace continued to drop (Mile 17, 7:14; Mile 18, 7:25; Mile 19, 7:30; Mile 20, 7:35; Mile 21, 7:36).

I didn‚Äôt notice it earlier in the race, but around here it was obvious that the lack of cloud cover was an issue. It didn‚Äôt feel that hot, but I noticed I was craving more and more Gatorade at the aid stations and around 22 or 23, I had to walk the drink breaks to get in multiple cups of Gatorade before dumping a cup of water on my head. 

These walk-throughs explain how my pace dropped more drastically as I clipped off times of 8:45 at Mile 22, and 9:09 at Mile 23. My pre-race plan was to hold with the 3:00 pace group until Mile 23, at which point I was going to try and send it home to a never-in-doubt 2:59 finish, but here I was holding on for dear life. In Houston, I ended up running a 3:17:57 and at this point, I just wanted to beat that. In that race, I fully stopped for a Michelob Ultra, so I‚Äôd be royally embarrassed if I couldn‚Äôt run better in Chicago.

At some point around here, I also hit a manhole cover awkwardly and rolled my ankle for half a second. I‚Äôm sure that in the moment I would‚Äôve loved to just completely bite it and roll onto the ground. Ah, well, at least I can stop running, I would‚Äôve thought to my self. I didn‚Äôt entirely lose my balance, so on I went.

An ice cold sponge and the increasing crowd support helped me maintain a jogging pace for the last few miles and I was able to enjoy the home stretch and pump my arms to the crowd to keep the cheering going. Apologies to the runner next to me on Mt. Roosevelt that I accidentally bumped on the head while I was trying to get the crowds to get a bit louder‚Ä¶

There was no dramatic sprint across the finish and I crossed the line in 3:14:22. 

### Post-race
I death-marched through the finisher‚Äôs chute to get my medal, beer, and Muscle Milk, and eventually made my way to pick up my drop bag. Eventually, I reunited with my wife and our friends before I made the call to go back home and recoup instead of hanging out with friends. I was in the emotional pain cave after finishing and didn‚Äôt feel like celebrating or enjoying the beautiful weather at the park.

The ride on the L and the slow walk back to our friends‚Äô house allowed me more of a chance to reflect on the day that was. After first meeting up with everyone after the race, I said that I was probably OK to not run any more marathons for a while, but by the time I got off the train, I was ready to do it again‚Ä¶

### Reflections
After my Houston Marathon, I felt like I had some clear next steps on how to regain my mojo and get closer to a sub-3:00 finish. I appreciated all of the productive and constructively critical comments in my Houston recap that suggested I run more volume, hit more MP during long runs, etc. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have expected it all to magically fall in place within one year, but I‚Äôm definitely discouraged by this recurring nightmare of second-half implosions. 

I‚Äôll be debriefing with my coach soon to talk through what went right, what went wrong, and realistic next steps from here. I know I should trust the process and look at my increased mileage as a step in the right direction, but I also know that with work and family life, continuing to increase mileage/strength training/physical therapy is going to be trickier and trickier. I‚Äôm not giving up on the sub-3:00 dream by any means, but I‚Äôm not sure if my next attempt will be.

As for what went well in addition to a respectable training block, I focused a lot on mindset and I believe my head was in a much better spot this time around. I recognized that I could only control the controllables and I visualized being uncomfortable throughout training. During the race, I tried putting my foot down on the gas, but the legs just weren‚Äôt there. In the past, I‚Äôve probably like my mindset influence my ability to send it, but this time in Chicago I went for it and just couldn‚Äôt hold on. I also can‚Äôt blame fueling as I was able to take down one AMACX turbo gel (or the occasional on-course Maurten) every three miles until mile 23 or 24, at which point all was essentially lost. 

All in all, this was a weird one for me and a bit of a gut punch as I‚Äôve not been able to keep up my momentum after running that 3:00:14 in Chicago in 2023. Was that an outlier? Have I just lost my fitness since then? I‚Äôll certainly be asking myself these questions in more over the next few weeks and months, but in the meantime, I‚Äôve most definitely not fallen out of love with running and look forward to cheering on runners in my hometown Baltimore Running Festival this weekend. 

As always, thanks in advance to whomever made it this far; thanks to this sub-reddit for allowing me the outlet to digest this experience.

1o7cgu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1o7cgu3/the_goodnighterschr√∂dingers_toe/,The Goodnighter/Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Toe,"It had been something to do with the kids. I had taken off work to spend the day with them‚Äîneither Trese or I had realized beforehand the day was a school holiday. I'd rolled back into bed after Trese had left but the kids were already rumbling around in their rooms before I could close my eyes.

So breakfast had come next with two children who had way more energy than I was prepared for. Even after a cup of coffee, I had difficulty tracking them, following behind my kids with my eyes (were they always this fast?). Television was out of the question for all three of us; my daughter had internalized their mother‚Äôs strict regimen of no TV until after six and no more than ninety minutes in a day. And there would surely be a report made if I plopped down in front of the boob tube (was it still called that even though televisions no longer had tubes?) while they ran around free range.

I had an idea, though. I figured lunch at McDonald‚Äôs, an hour or two at the park, and then back home. If I started dinner at four, it would be ready by the time Trese got home around 5:30. So from 2:30 to 4:00 I had a small gap to fill.

We were going to make a monster.

I started with a belch, the physical memory of my Quarter Pounder with Cheese reaching up to remind me of lunch, the three of us sitting down at the dining table, each with a pen and paper, although my son barely knew the alphabet.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs our guy going to look like?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSuper tall and super skinny,‚Äù RJ said. It wasn‚Äôt lost on me that I was tall and thin and my boy might have been using his father as a template. Lana made a face, she‚Äôd probably realized it too, but thankfully she let it pass.

‚ÄúOkay, tall and thin.‚Äù I began a bullet list and RJ began doodling a green stick figure with my tri-color pen. ‚ÄúWhat else?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got big feet. Real big.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a clown?‚Äù I asked.

RJ thought. ‚ÄúNo. Regular feet.‚Äù

Lana was staring at something two miles away. ‚ÄúHow about you, L? What do you think he has?‚Äù

She slowly rolled her eyes over to me. Lana was thirteen and on the edge of finding everything her parents did as corny, cheesy, or wholly designed with the complete desolation of her burgeoning social life in mind.

She took a deep breath and blew it out. ‚ÄúWell, first of all, why does he even have to be a he?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be a girl. It‚Äôs gotta be a boy,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúBoys make the best monsters! Freddy‚Ä¶ Jason‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú*Bloooooooody* Mary. *Bloooooooody* Mary‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana lifted her hands toward her little brother like she had a marionette strung to her fingers. RJ clapped his fingers over his ears as if not hearing the name a third time would protect him once she popped out of the mirror, his complexion blanching considerably for his deep shade of brown.

‚ÄúAll right, all right,‚Äù I said, a smile creeping to the corner of my mouth. My children knew all the classic horror monsters of my youth, despite my wife protesting they were ‚Äôtoo young for that stuff‚Äô. ‚ÄúSo we have a girl monster.‚Äù

Lana shook her head. ‚ÄúWhy a boy or a girl? This thing isn‚Äôt real, why do we have to shackle it with a gender construct at all?‚Äù I felt my brow lift in surprise but I was proud of my daughter, too.

RJ squinted one eye, confused. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs smooth like a Ken doll down there?‚Äù The question caught me by surprise‚Äînot because of my son‚Äôs comparison, but that he'd had to have heard me make a statement that was a variation of what I was asking.



I‚Äôd have to be more careful about what I said out loud around them.

‚ÄúWho knows what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù Lana said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúMaybe you find out before you die.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo is it gonna teabag me to death or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúGuh-*ross*,‚Äù Lana said. I tried my best and failed miserably to not laugh, the sound coming out of me like a fork caught in a garbage disposal. Yeah. I was definitely going to have to watch what I said.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get back on track. We don‚Äôt have to get into what genitalia, if any, our boogie-*person* has.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs jenny‚Ä¶ jenna‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lana formed her arms into an open V to either side of her and chopped toward her groin. RJ nodded.

‚ÄúYou mean penis-vagina. Why didn‚Äôt you say that?‚Äù From the look on my son‚Äôs face, I could tell he was warming to the idea of a gender-less or mystery-gendered monster.

‚ÄúAnyway, I think they should wear a cloak and a bowler hat. All the big monsters wear something iconically identifiable‚ÄîJason has a hockey mask, Freddy has a Christmas sweater, Michael Meyers has that Shatner mask, Candyman has that big winter coat, and Dracula has that black cape that‚Äôs red on the inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I see you got ideas,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBoy, are you drawing all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù RJ doodled in deep concentration, the tip of his tongue poking out of the corner of his mouth. ‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äù He held up his notepad and showed us the stick figure he'd drawn of a monster with dagger teeth and what looked like a large, hairy snake around its neck.

‚ÄúIs that a cater‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI love it!‚Äù Lana said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre wearing a black boa!‚Äù

‚ÄúA black boa,‚Äù I said as if that had been obvious. I was glad my daughter had cut me off before I could say ‚Äúcaterpillar.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd glass teeth,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúNo. Diamond teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they have teeth made out of jewelry?‚Äù Lana asked.¬†

I was about to tell my daughter to take it easy on her little brother when RJ responded. ‚ÄúDiamonds are the hardest material known to man!‚Äù He seemed to ponder a moment then asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a Shatner?‚Äù

‚ÄúDiamond sharp teeth.‚Äù I wrote it down and then looked up at my children. ‚ÄúNow what does our mystery monster do? Let‚Äôs make it unique. I had a couple ideas but I was really enjoying what they were coming up with.

Lana and RJ sat quietly in thought. No doubt they were thinking of and passing on monsters that killed horny teenagers, creepy children, bloodsuckers‚Äî

‚ÄúIt gets you when you go to bed,‚Äù RJ said.¬†

‚ÄúYou mean like the Sandman?‚Äù Lana asked and rolled her eyes. Despite her tone, I could tell she was invested in the process.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt get you when you go to sleep or put you to sleep.‚Äù He smiled slyly and looked between his sister and me. ‚ÄúIt gets you if you don‚Äôt go to sleep.‚Äù

That sent a chill up I‚Äôs spine and I cleared my throat and shifted in my chair. I didn‚Äôt think they knew I had problems with insomnia, but then again, I had a history of saying things sometimes without being aware my children were in the room.

‚ÄúOoo, that‚Äôs really good,‚Äù Lana said, grinning. Now I definitely couldn‚Äôt squash the sleep thing.

‚ÄúOkay, so he watches you while you sleep,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDad.‚Äù Lana looked at him. ‚ÄúFirst of all‚Äî*they*‚Äîand second, *they* watch you to make sure you go to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Got it.‚Äù It had been worth trying but Lana wasn‚Äôt as distractible as her brother. I wrote the suggestion down and was eager to wrap up. When I finished, Lana and RJ were staring at me.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù RJ said.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt forget the most important part!‚Äù

For a moment I felt ice pouring down the column of my spine when the thought of them saying in unison, ‚ÄôThey‚Äôre right behind you,‚Äô popped in my head. My children were separated by seven years but there was something very twinnish in the set of their faces at that moment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the most important part?‚Äù

Lana had wrapped her arms in front of her and gestured to her brother for him to say it. ‚ÄúThe name. We gotta give them a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Yeah, we do. What, uhh, what do you guys think?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, Mr. Goodnight. No, wait. That won‚Äôt work, will it, Lana?‚Äù.

‚ÄúHow about, The Goodnighter?‚Äù I said finally. I could tell Lana was folding back into her own angsty world and I'd be losing her shortly. ‚ÄúMaybe they could pluck off a toe if you don‚Äôt go to sleep as a warning. Or better yet‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLame.‚Äù Lana snorted. ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like it.‚Äù RJ gave me a thumb‚Äôs up.

The moment had passed and I collected the notepads and tore out the sheets that RJ and I had used. Lana had participated, but she hadn‚Äôt written or drawn anything in her notepad. That had been about as much as I could have expected.

I noticed the time and quickly put everything away before starting dinner. I was going to make my famous honey and hot sauce chicken that despite her general indifference, even Lana loved.

By the time Trese got home, dinner was ready. I made au gratin potatoes from the box and steamed some green beans. We kissed hello and Trese lassoed the kids into a hug and asked them about their day. RJ rattled off a million details of which the Goodnighter was only a small part and they followed her upstairs. By the time the three of them came back down, four plates were waiting with two glasses of Pinot Grigio and two cups of Faygo Rock ‚Äôn Rye.

‚ÄúIs this for me?‚Äù Lana said with too big of a smile on her face, pretending to belly up in front of a plate with a glass of wine by it. ‚ÄúKidding,‚Äù she said when Trese and I responded with blank looks at her.

All four of us sat and ate together and it was so pleasant that the Goodnighter was mostly forgotten. But it remained a tiny knot somewhere in my brain and no matter how many jokes I told that everyone laughed at, it remained, drawing from me like a tumor. Except it supped my mind, irrigating through synapses, growing not in size but in scope, developing in character like a growing fetus in the womb.

*The Goodnighter watched from the darkest corner in the bedroom, waiting until a random appointed hour when everyone should be asleep. Then it floated out of its sliver of corner, expanding like a balloon, compressing the air in the room into an uncomfortable thickness, the black boa crawling around its neck and cinching into a chokehold aro*und *the creature‚Äôs* *neck. It watched*‚Äî

‚ÄúHoney, where‚Äôd you go?‚Äù

I looked up from the dishes in the sink at my wife. She‚Äôd interrupted whatever had just been going through my mind just then and I'd instantly forgotten what it was.¬†

‚ÄúSorry. Just lost in thought.‚Äù Trese continued staring at me and I realized I was supposed to have responded to something she‚Äôd said. I tried to scramble back over the shaving of words I'd caught and wasn‚Äôt able to put them together into something coherent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, babe. I totally zoned. What did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to go to Margate? You seem hot and cold on it. We could always go to another amusement park. I just figured, it‚Äôs in the UK‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo-no. Yeah. I wanna go.‚Äù I turned to my wife. ‚ÄúI really do. You know me. I need a Xanax to get on a plane and I hate how that makes me feel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm going to be right next to you. You don‚Äôt have anything to worry about.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf only anxiety worked that easily.‚Äù I smiled.¬†

Trese looped two fingers around two of mine. ‚ÄúYou know, if you‚Äôre feeling anxious now‚Ä¶‚Äù She gave me a coy smile. ‚ÄúUnless it doesn‚Äôt work like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no. It works exactly like that.‚Äù

I hustled my wife upstairs. The kids were already showered for the night, my son waiting in bed for a story. Trese gave him a big hug and kiss before saying goodnight to Lana and going into our bedroom for a shower.¬†

‚ÄúGoodnight, bro,‚Äù my son said after I had finished two chapters from the book.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me bro.‚Äù I narrowed my eyes. ‚ÄúOr I will *kill* you where you stand.‚Äù RJ giggled as I leaned in and kissed his forehead before he flopped over on his other side.

Finally, my daughter came out of the main bathroom, her twists up in a bonnet.

‚ÄúG‚Äônight, Daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet dreams, El.‚Äù I kissed her forehead as we passed each other.

‚ÄúGoodnight, RJ,‚Äù she said at her brother‚Äôs threshold.

‚ÄúGoodnight, bro!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your bro.‚Äù She disappeared into her room, rolling her eyes the whole way.

Before I could step fully into my bedroom, I caught sight of my naked wife in silhouette standing just outside of our en suite bathroom. Both our bodies had changed over seventeen years of marriage and two kids (I‚Äôd done more than my fair share of sympathy eating when she‚Äôd been pregnant) but right then I would have preferred this woman to any prior version of her.¬†

‚ÄúI should take a shower‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúClose the door.‚Äù



We lay in bed together after, our hands lingering on one another for several minutes. It had been a while‚Äîwork, kids, life in general. I'd missed her more than I would have thought had I actually thought about it and she had made love to me with an urgency as if our time were limited by one of our own parents who would open the door at any moment.¬†

Trese‚Äôs hand slid off my pudgy belly as she turned over on her side, drifting off into a near uninterruptible slumber. I would have envied her except my lids had steadily been getting heavier by the moment. My breathing deepened as I spooned my body behind hers, one of her perfectly proportioned breasts filling the cup of my hand. I tumbled into sleep, conscious of one last breath before I was gone.



*‚Äîbreathing in impending terror, anticipated agony, eventual dread.*

*The Goodnighter floated just above the floor, the tail of their boa dragging behind their many-toed, filthy feet. I could feel them just beyond the footboard of the bed, the knot that had been in my mind now outside but still attached like a bundle of nerves stringing out of me.*

I kept my eyes shut, hoping to slip back to sleep before they could reach me. The Goodnighter rotated in the air until they were parallel with the bed. I could feel the air between them and me being squeezed as they lowered closer.

I squeezed my eyelids together, counterintuitive to sleep but I couldn‚Äôt help it. The only sound I could hear aside from the susurrus of Trese‚Äôs gentle breathing was the fingernail scratches against the window of the branch I had clipped from the tree at the beginning of spring.

I felt exposed where my body wasn‚Äôt covered by the comforter, my head and neck feeling particularly vulnerable. The arm I considered sacrificeable and my foot should have been fine because I always wore socks to bed.¬†

But then something pinched a toe through my sock. I'd had a cat when I'd been a teenager that would play with my feet, but it had run away when I'd left for college twenty years ago.

The lore that had written itself in my head told me the Goodnighter was plucking off my toe, but that had to be ridiculous. My mind was aggressively playing tricks. Too many consecutive nights of poor sleep were impressing a layer of paranoia upon me. I almost believed I could feel its long, slender fingers flexing my toe back and forth through the clingy film of my imagination just before‚Ä¶¬†

Nothing?

I was tempted to sit up in bed, but the impression still draping over me was so palpable, my irrational fear anchored me to the bed. I slowly pulled the rest of my body beneath the comforter, knowing and not caring I was going to sweat the bed.

I didn‚Äôt want to wake Trese even though the only thing I wanted was my wife‚Äôs comfort. I settled for curling up next to her as Trese‚Äôs breathing deepened.



‚ÄúGood morning, sleepyhead!‚Äù my family shouted in unison as I shambled into the kitchen. I rubbed my eye as I absorbed the sunlight coming in through the deck window, devouring the crumbs of leftover dreams. Trese had the electric griddle on the table with two pancakes on it and was in the process of pouring a third. The kids had scrambled eggs and bacon along with two pancakes each, taken from the growing stack on the plate next to the griddle.

I gave them my best smile as I beelined for the Keurig. Trese already had it loaded with my Walking Dead mug and I grabbed the sugar and a spoon from the drawer.¬†

‚ÄúIt already has‚Äî‚Äù I gave my wife a dead-eye stare as I spooned sugar into my mug. I slapped the Keurig closed and started it. I felt myself coming officially awake as coffee scented the air.

‚ÄúG‚Äômorning, guys,‚Äù I said and sat at the table. ‚ÄúWhat made you do all this?‚Äù Trese wasn‚Äôt much for cooking.

‚ÄúWell, after what you did for me last night, I figured I‚Äôd return the favor.‚Äù She winked at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with your eye?‚Äù RJ asked.

‚ÄúOh god,‚Äù Lana said.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre very welcome, madam,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh *god*.‚Äù

There was bacon at one edge of the griddle and I pinched a couple rashers.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eggs in the fridge if you want some.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I think I‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said, reaching for the pancakes. ‚ÄúOn second thought, you guys‚Äô look good.‚Äù I scooted back from the table, taking my coffee with me as I went to the refrigerator and rooted around for the eggs. I kept meaning to arrange everything in here and putting it off. The shelves could also use a cleaning and I was relatively sure there was an opened bottle of mini pickles in the back that had been there since RJ was a baby.

I backed out of the fridge with two eggs and something about the pan with the remnants of the scrambled eggs still in it made me think of last night. That crazy dream with the monster the kids and I had made up.

But wait, why did I remember drifting off to sleep after then? I'd briefly fallen asleep after Trese and I had made love, but that was always more of a nap. I recalled tossing around until I'd gotten comfortable with half my upper body from underneath the covers. Then it came.

No. Then *they* came.

Detail filled my mind like one of those old computers that flashed nonsensical data as they booted up. The scratching at the window by a branch that was no longer there, the air thickening, and something touching my toe.¬†

Them *pinching* my toe.

But that had been just my imagination leisurely galloping, unbridled by my command. It hadn‚Äôt been real.

*It hadn‚Äôt been real.*

I looked down at my foot, still with the sock on I'd worn to bed. I wiggled my toes.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were all there.

1o7cgiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1o7cgiu/parenting_hack_lower_your_expectations_and_double/,Parenting hack: lower your expectations and double your patience,"I swear the best parenting hack no one talks about is just expecting less from yourself and your kid. Not in a negative way in a realistic way. I used to start every day with this mental checklist like balanced breakfast, no screens before 10, educational playtime, tidy house by nap. By noon, I‚Äôd already feel like I failed because none of it went how I pictured. My kid wanted pancakes instead of oatmeal, spilled juice everywhere, threw a tantrum about socks and suddenly the day was chaos.  
Now I aim lower and somehow get more done. If breakfast happens without a meltdown, that‚Äôs a win. If we go outside once a day, that‚Äôs a bonus. I‚Äôve learned that peace comes from dropping the imaginary scoreboard of perfect parent and doubling down on patience instead. Some afternoons I‚Äôll just let him play with blocks while I clean or answer emails. Other days I‚Äôll sit next to him and just exist in the mess. And when he finally naps I don‚Äôt feel bad for not being productive sometimes I‚Äôll just make coffee or scroll a bit before resetting for round two. Lowering my expectations didn‚Äôt make me lazy it made me present. Anyone else figure out that good parenting is really just being okay with imperfection?",25,1760538343.0,Parenting,2,0.91,False
1o7cg73,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o7cg73/the_goodnighterschr√∂dingers_toe/,The Goodnighter/Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Toe,"It had been something to do with the kids. I had taken off work to spend the day with them‚Äîneither Trese or I had realized beforehand the day was a school holiday. I'd rolled back into bed after Trese had left but the kids were already rumbling around in their rooms before I could close my eyes.

So breakfast had come next with two children who had way more energy than I was prepared for. Even after a cup of coffee, I had difficulty tracking them, following behind my kids with my eyes (were they always this fast?). Television was out of the question for all three of us; my daughter had internalized their mother‚Äôs strict regimen of no TV until after six and no more than ninety minutes in a day. And there would surely be a report made if I plopped down in front of the boob tube (was it still called that even though televisions no longer had tubes?) while they ran around free range.

I had an idea, though. I figured lunch at McDonald‚Äôs, an hour or two at the park, and then back home. If I started dinner at four, it would be ready by the time Trese got home around 5:30. So from 2:30 to 4:00 I had a small gap to fill.

We were going to make a monster.

I started with a belch, the physical memory of my Quarter Pounder with Cheese reaching up to remind me of lunch, the three of us sitting down at the dining table, each with a pen and paper, although my son barely knew the alphabet.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs our guy going to look like?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSuper tall and super skinny,‚Äù RJ said. It wasn‚Äôt lost on me that I was tall and thin and my boy might have been using his father as a template. Lana made a face, she‚Äôd probably realized it too, but thankfully she let it pass.

‚ÄúOkay, tall and thin.‚Äù I began a bullet list and RJ began doodling a green stick figure with my tri-color pen. ‚ÄúWhat else?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got big feet. Real big.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a clown?‚Äù I asked.

RJ thought. ‚ÄúNo. Regular feet.‚Äù

Lana was staring at something two miles away. ‚ÄúHow about you, L? What do you think he has?‚Äù

She slowly rolled her eyes over to me. Lana was thirteen and on the edge of finding everything her parents did as corny, cheesy, or wholly designed with the complete desolation of her burgeoning social life in mind.

She took a deep breath and blew it out. ‚ÄúWell, first of all, why does he even have to be a he?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be a girl. It‚Äôs gotta be a boy,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúBoys make the best monsters! Freddy‚Ä¶ Jason‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú*Bloooooooody* Mary. *Bloooooooody* Mary‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana lifted her hands toward her little brother like she had a marionette strung to her fingers. RJ clapped his fingers over his ears as if not hearing the name a third time would protect him once she popped out of the mirror, his complexion blanching considerably for his deep shade of brown.

‚ÄúAll right, all right,‚Äù I said, a smile creeping to the corner of my mouth. My children knew all the classic horror monsters of my youth, despite my wife protesting they were ‚Äôtoo young for that stuff‚Äô. ‚ÄúSo we have a girl monster.‚Äù

Lana shook her head. ‚ÄúWhy a boy or a girl? This thing isn‚Äôt real, why do we have to shackle it with a gender construct at all?‚Äù I felt my brow lift in surprise but I was proud of my daughter, too.

RJ squinted one eye, confused. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs smooth like a Ken doll down there?‚Äù The question caught me by surprise‚Äînot because of my son‚Äôs comparison, but that he'd had to have heard me make a statement that was a variation of what I was asking.



I‚Äôd have to be more careful about what I said out loud around them.

‚ÄúWho knows what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù Lana said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúMaybe you find out before you die.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo is it gonna teabag me to death or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúGuh-*ross*,‚Äù Lana said. I tried my best and failed miserably to not laugh, the sound coming out of me like a fork caught in a garbage disposal. Yeah. I was definitely going to have to watch what I said.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get back on track. We don‚Äôt have to get into what genitalia, if any, our boogie-*person* has.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs jenny‚Ä¶ jenna‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lana formed her arms into an open V to either side of her and chopped toward her groin. RJ nodded.

‚ÄúYou mean penis-vagina. Why didn‚Äôt you say that?‚Äù From the look on my son‚Äôs face, I could tell he was warming to the idea of a gender-less or mystery-gendered monster.

‚ÄúAnyway, I think they should wear a cloak and a bowler hat. All the big monsters wear something iconically identifiable‚ÄîJason has a hockey mask, Freddy has a Christmas sweater, Michael Meyers has that Shatner mask, Candyman has that big winter coat, and Dracula has that black cape that‚Äôs red on the inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I see you got ideas,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBoy, are you drawing all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù RJ doodled in deep concentration, the tip of his tongue poking out of the corner of his mouth. ‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äù He held up his notepad and showed us the stick figure he'd drawn of a monster with dagger teeth and what looked like a large, hairy snake around its neck.

‚ÄúIs that a cater‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI love it!‚Äù Lana said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre wearing a black boa!‚Äù

‚ÄúA black boa,‚Äù I said as if that had been obvious. I was glad my daughter had cut me off before I could say ‚Äúcaterpillar.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd glass teeth,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúNo. Diamond teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they have teeth made out of jewelry?‚Äù Lana asked.¬†

I was about to tell my daughter to take it easy on her little brother when RJ responded. ‚ÄúDiamonds are the hardest material known to man!‚Äù He seemed to ponder a moment then asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a Shatner?‚Äù

‚ÄúDiamond sharp teeth.‚Äù I wrote it down and then looked up at my children. ‚ÄúNow what does our mystery monster do? Let‚Äôs make it unique. I had a couple ideas but I was really enjoying what they were coming up with.

Lana and RJ sat quietly in thought. No doubt they were thinking of and passing on monsters that killed horny teenagers, creepy children, bloodsuckers‚Äî

‚ÄúIt gets you when you go to bed,‚Äù RJ said.¬†

‚ÄúYou mean like the Sandman?‚Äù Lana asked and rolled her eyes. Despite her tone, I could tell she was invested in the process.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt get you when you go to sleep or put you to sleep.‚Äù He smiled slyly and looked between his sister and me. ‚ÄúIt gets you if you don‚Äôt go to sleep.‚Äù

That sent a chill up I‚Äôs spine and I cleared my throat and shifted in my chair. I didn‚Äôt think they knew I had problems with insomnia, but then again, I had a history of saying things sometimes without being aware my children were in the room.

‚ÄúOoo, that‚Äôs really good,‚Äù Lana said, grinning. Now I definitely couldn‚Äôt squash the sleep thing.

‚ÄúOkay, so he watches you while you sleep,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDad.‚Äù Lana looked at him. ‚ÄúFirst of all‚Äî*they*‚Äîand second, *they* watch you to make sure you go to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Got it.‚Äù It had been worth trying but Lana wasn‚Äôt as distractible as her brother. I wrote the suggestion down and was eager to wrap up. When I finished, Lana and RJ were staring at me.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù RJ said.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt forget the most important part!‚Äù

For a moment I felt ice pouring down the column of my spine when the thought of them saying in unison, ‚ÄôThey‚Äôre right behind you,‚Äô popped in my head. My children were separated by seven years but there was something very twinnish in the set of their faces at that moment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the most important part?‚Äù

Lana had wrapped her arms in front of her and gestured to her brother for him to say it. ‚ÄúThe name. We gotta give them a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Yeah, we do. What, uhh, what do you guys think?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, Mr. Goodnight. No, wait. That won‚Äôt work, will it, Lana?‚Äù.

‚ÄúHow about, The Goodnighter?‚Äù I said finally. I could tell Lana was folding back into her own angsty world and I'd be losing her shortly. ‚ÄúMaybe they could pluck off a toe if you don‚Äôt go to sleep as a warning. Or better yet‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLame.‚Äù Lana snorted. ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like it.‚Äù RJ gave me a thumb‚Äôs up.

The moment had passed and I collected the notepads and tore out the sheets that RJ and I had used. Lana had participated, but she hadn‚Äôt written or drawn anything in her notepad. That had been about as much as I could have expected.

I noticed the time and quickly put everything away before starting dinner. I was going to make my famous honey and hot sauce chicken that despite her general indifference, even Lana loved.

By the time Trese got home, dinner was ready. I made au gratin potatoes from the box and steamed some green beans. We kissed hello and Trese lassoed the kids into a hug and asked them about their day. RJ rattled off a million details of which the Goodnighter was only a small part and they followed her upstairs. By the time the three of them came back down, four plates were waiting with two glasses of Pinot Grigio and two cups of Faygo Rock ‚Äôn Rye.

‚ÄúIs this for me?‚Äù Lana said with too big of a smile on her face, pretending to belly up in front of a plate with a glass of wine by it. ‚ÄúKidding,‚Äù she said when Trese and I responded with blank looks at her.

All four of us sat and ate together and it was so pleasant that the Goodnighter was mostly forgotten. But it remained a tiny knot somewhere in my brain and no matter how many jokes I told that everyone laughed at, it remained, drawing from me like a tumor. Except it supped my mind, irrigating through synapses, growing not in size but in scope, developing in character like a growing fetus in the womb.

*The Goodnighter watched from the darkest corner in the bedroom, waiting until a random appointed hour when everyone should be asleep. Then it floated out of its sliver of corner, expanding like a balloon, compressing the air in the room into an uncomfortable thickness, the black boa crawling around its neck and cinching into a chokehold aro*und *the creature‚Äôs* *neck. It watched*‚Äî

‚ÄúHoney, where‚Äôd you go?‚Äù

I looked up from the dishes in the sink at my wife. She‚Äôd interrupted whatever had just been going through my mind just then and I'd instantly forgotten what it was.¬†

‚ÄúSorry. Just lost in thought.‚Äù Trese continued staring at me and I realized I was supposed to have responded to something she‚Äôd said. I tried to scramble back over the shaving of words I'd caught and wasn‚Äôt able to put them together into something coherent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, babe. I totally zoned. What did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to go to Margate? You seem hot and cold on it. We could always go to another amusement park. I just figured, it‚Äôs in the UK‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo-no. Yeah. I wanna go.‚Äù I turned to my wife. ‚ÄúI really do. You know me. I need a Xanax to get on a plane and I hate how that makes me feel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm going to be right next to you. You don‚Äôt have anything to worry about.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf only anxiety worked that easily.‚Äù I smiled.¬†

Trese looped two fingers around two of mine. ‚ÄúYou know, if you‚Äôre feeling anxious now‚Ä¶‚Äù She gave me a coy smile. ‚ÄúUnless it doesn‚Äôt work like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no. It works exactly like that.‚Äù

I hustled my wife upstairs. The kids were already showered for the night, my son waiting in bed for a story. Trese gave him a big hug and kiss before saying goodnight to Lana and going into our bedroom for a shower.¬†

‚ÄúGoodnight, bro,‚Äù my son said after I had finished two chapters from the book.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me bro.‚Äù I narrowed my eyes. ‚ÄúOr I will *kill* you where you stand.‚Äù RJ giggled as I leaned in and kissed his forehead before he flopped over on his other side.

Finally, my daughter came out of the main bathroom, her twists up in a bonnet.

‚ÄúG‚Äônight, Daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet dreams, El.‚Äù I kissed her forehead as we passed each other.

‚ÄúGoodnight, RJ,‚Äù she said at her brother‚Äôs threshold.

‚ÄúGoodnight, bro!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your bro.‚Äù She disappeared into her room, rolling her eyes the whole way.

Before I could step fully into my bedroom, I caught sight of my naked wife in silhouette standing just outside of our en suite bathroom. Both our bodies had changed over seventeen years of marriage and two kids (I‚Äôd done more than my fair share of sympathy eating when she‚Äôd been pregnant) but right then I would have preferred this woman to any prior version of her.¬†

‚ÄúI should take a shower‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúClose the door.‚Äù



We lay in bed together after, our hands lingering on one another for several minutes. It had been a while‚Äîwork, kids, life in general. I'd missed her more than I would have thought had I actually thought about it and she had made love to me with an urgency as if our time were limited by one of our own parents who would open the door at any moment.¬†

Trese‚Äôs hand slid off my pudgy belly as she turned over on her side, drifting off into a near uninterruptible slumber. I would have envied her except my lids had steadily been getting heavier by the moment. My breathing deepened as I spooned my body behind hers, one of her perfectly proportioned breasts filling the cup of my hand. I tumbled into sleep, conscious of one last breath before I was gone.



*‚Äîbreathing in impending terror, anticipated agony, eventual dread.*

*The Goodnighter floated just above the floor, the tail of their boa dragging behind their many-toed, filthy feet. I could feel them just beyond the footboard of the bed, the knot that had been in my mind now outside but still attached like a bundle of nerves stringing out of me.*

I kept my eyes shut, hoping to slip back to sleep before they could reach me. The Goodnighter rotated in the air until they were parallel with the bed. I could feel the air between them and me being squeezed as they lowered closer.

I squeezed my eyelids together, counterintuitive to sleep but I couldn‚Äôt help it. The only sound I could hear aside from the susurrus of Trese‚Äôs gentle breathing was the fingernail scratches against the window of the branch I had clipped from the tree at the beginning of spring.

I felt exposed where my body wasn‚Äôt covered by the comforter, my head and neck feeling particularly vulnerable. The arm I considered sacrificeable and my foot should have been fine because I always wore socks to bed.¬†

But then something pinched a toe through my sock. I'd had a cat when I'd been a teenager that would play with my feet, but it had run away when I'd left for college twenty years ago.

The lore that had written itself in my head told me the Goodnighter was plucking off my toe, but that had to be ridiculous. My mind was aggressively playing tricks. Too many consecutive nights of poor sleep were impressing a layer of paranoia upon me. I almost believed I could feel its long, slender fingers flexing my toe back and forth through the clingy film of my imagination just before‚Ä¶¬†

Nothing?

I was tempted to sit up in bed, but the impression still draping over me was so palpable, my irrational fear anchored me to the bed. I slowly pulled the rest of my body beneath the comforter, knowing and not caring I was going to sweat the bed.

I didn‚Äôt want to wake Trese even though the only thing I wanted was my wife‚Äôs comfort. I settled for curling up next to her as Trese‚Äôs breathing deepened.



‚ÄúGood morning, sleepyhead!‚Äù my family shouted in unison as I shambled into the kitchen. I rubbed my eye as I absorbed the sunlight coming in through the deck window, devouring the crumbs of leftover dreams. Trese had the electric griddle on the table with two pancakes on it and was in the process of pouring a third. The kids had scrambled eggs and bacon along with two pancakes each, taken from the growing stack on the plate next to the griddle.

I gave them my best smile as I beelined for the Keurig. Trese already had it loaded with my Walking Dead mug and I grabbed the sugar and a spoon from the drawer.¬†

‚ÄúIt already has‚Äî‚Äù I gave my wife a dead-eye stare as I spooned sugar into my mug. I slapped the Keurig closed and started it. I felt myself coming officially awake as coffee scented the air.

‚ÄúG‚Äômorning, guys,‚Äù I said and sat at the table. ‚ÄúWhat made you do all this?‚Äù Trese wasn‚Äôt much for cooking.

‚ÄúWell, after what you did for me last night, I figured I‚Äôd return the favor.‚Äù She winked at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with your eye?‚Äù RJ asked.

‚ÄúOh god,‚Äù Lana said.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre very welcome, madam,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh *god*.‚Äù

There was bacon at one edge of the griddle and I pinched a couple rashers.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eggs in the fridge if you want some.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I think I‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said, reaching for the pancakes. ‚ÄúOn second thought, you guys‚Äô look good.‚Äù I scooted back from the table, taking my coffee with me as I went to the refrigerator and rooted around for the eggs.

I‚Äôm unsure how to express how unsatisfied I‚Äôve been with how things are going.

I joined a newer team that had two fully remote employees. The manager told me he‚Äôd be doing a lot of on-site training to get me started. It seemed they were selling that as the reason the role was classified as ‚Äúon-site.‚Äù However, once I started, my manager only came into the office about once every other week for business meetings with the lead salespeople. I spend my days sitting alone in the corner of a large office space‚Äîkind of like a school library‚Äôs computer lab‚Äîwith long rows of tables and computers, and no one else around. I don‚Äôt physically collaborate with anyone. I commute two hours a day via subway to sit there alone and work independently.

During my first quarterly review three months ago, I brought this up. I requested some wfh days, explaining that no one is onsite for me to collaborate with, my commute is long (and has since gotten longer because I moved out of my sublet), WFH is my preferred work style, and it‚Äôs clearly offered to others. My request was denied by the owners, my manager, and HR, who claimed, ‚ÄúYou must be in office because you work with the mechanical team.‚Äù I had no idea what they were talking about. I don‚Äôt know what that team is, what they do, or who is even on it. It seemed like an obvious lie. I still haven‚Äôt interacted with any other team since then. Nothing has changed.

Things got worse when the owner scheduled mandatory customer service training during the week of 9/11 in NYC, and I arrived 10 minutes late due to subway delays. The owner told my manager‚Äîwho, again, never comes into the office to witness anything‚Äîthat I wasn‚Äôt arriving on time. My manager then began micromanaging my arrival, messaging me on Teams at 8:59 a.m., and questioning why I didn‚Äôt respond immediately‚Äîeven though I had just walked in and was in the bathroom or getting coffee.

What‚Äôs made it even more frustrating is that they recently hired a new person to our team who is fully remote. I am now training that person via Zoom on the same tasks that I was hired to do. They are doing the exact same job‚Äîremotely. This week, they also hired a hybrid intern. I‚Äôve never felt so unequally treated in my life.

The culture is also incredibly lame. Our work revolves around climate compliance, yet I‚Äôve heard senior staff refer to climate change and related policy as a ‚Äúscam‚Äù multiple times. To each their own, but that‚Äôs completely at odds with my values and what I went to school for. It‚Äôs also very off putting to me that senior management is literally only old white men. I am not lying. Their executive meetings are literally only old white men. They also don‚Äôt offer time off for holidays like Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth, Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day, etc. On Juneteenth, I literally heard employees walking around joking about how stupid DEI is, asking POC coworkers, ‚ÄúDo you feel oppressed? Are you going to take the day off? Haha.‚Äù The poc workers giving ‚Äúhaha yeah dei is dumb‚Äù or whatever replies back, but I doubt they aren‚Äôt seething internally about being robbed of a day off, let alone being openly discriminated against. 

The company also constantly throws around the cookie cutter red flag ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a family‚Äù rhetoric. It‚Äôs all over their LinkedIn posts‚Äîalmost like it‚Äôs their slogan. I find it incredibly ironic and absurd considering how miserably I‚Äôve been treated so far.

Now that I‚Äôm at my six-month mark, with my second quarterly review next week, I don‚Äôt even know how to bring up my concerns without risking being fired. I honestly have nothing but negative feedback right now. All I want is to have work from home days. Based on how they flat-out denied my request last time, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd just do it again.

How am I supposed to bring this up in the meeting? What am I supposed to say? Should I say anything at all? If I tell them the double standards and micromanagement make me uncomfortable, would they just fire me?",0,1760538272.0,careerguidance,5,0.5,False

I had an idea, though. I figured lunch at McDonald‚Äôs, an hour or two at the park, and then back home. If I started dinner at four, it would be ready by the time Trese got home around 5:30. So from 2:30 to 4:00 I had a small gap to fill.

We were going to make a monster.

I started with a belch, the physical memory of my Quarter Pounder with Cheese reaching up to remind me of lunch, the three of us sitting down at the dining table, each with a pen and paper, although my son barely knew the alphabet.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs our guy going to look like?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSuper tall and super skinny,‚Äù RJ said. It wasn‚Äôt lost on me that I was tall and thin and my boy might have been using his father as a template. Lana made a face, she‚Äôd probably realized it too, but thankfully she let it pass.

‚ÄúOkay, tall and thin.‚Äù I began a bullet list and RJ began doodling a green stick figure with my tri-color pen. ‚ÄúWhat else?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got big feet. Real big.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a clown?‚Äù I asked.

RJ thought. ‚ÄúNo. Regular feet.‚Äù

Lana was staring at something two miles away. ‚ÄúHow about you, L? What do you think he has?‚Äù

She slowly rolled her eyes over to me. Lana was thirteen and on the edge of finding everything her parents did as corny, cheesy, or wholly designed with the complete desolation of her burgeoning social life in mind.

She took a deep breath and blew it out. ‚ÄúWell, first of all, why does he even have to be a he?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be a girl. It‚Äôs gotta be a boy,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúBoys make the best monsters! Freddy‚Ä¶ Jason‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú*Bloooooooody* Mary. *Bloooooooody* Mary‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana lifted her hands toward her little brother like she had a marionette strung to her fingers. RJ clapped his fingers over his ears as if not hearing the name a third time would protect him once she popped out of the mirror, his complexion blanching considerably for his deep shade of brown.

‚ÄúAll right, all right,‚Äù I said, a smile creeping to the corner of my mouth. My children knew all the classic horror monsters of my youth, despite my wife protesting they were ‚Äôtoo young for that stuff‚Äô. ‚ÄúSo we have a girl monster.‚Äù

Lana shook her head. ‚ÄúWhy a boy or a girl? This thing isn‚Äôt real, why do we have to shackle it with a gender construct at all?‚Äù I felt my brow lift in surprise but I was proud of my daughter, too.

RJ squinted one eye, confused. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs smooth like a Ken doll down there?‚Äù The question caught me by surprise‚Äînot because of my son‚Äôs comparison, but that he'd had to have heard me make a statement that was a variation of what I was asking.



I‚Äôd have to be more careful about what I said out loud around them.

‚ÄúWho knows what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù Lana said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúMaybe you find out before you die.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo is it gonna teabag me to death or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúGuh-*ross*,‚Äù Lana said. I tried my best and failed miserably to not laugh, the sound coming out of me like a fork caught in a garbage disposal. Yeah. I was definitely going to have to watch what I said.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get back on track. We don‚Äôt have to get into what genitalia, if any, our boogie-*person* has.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs jenny‚Ä¶ jenna‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lana formed her arms into an open V to either side of her and chopped toward her groin. RJ nodded.

‚ÄúYou mean penis-vagina. Why didn‚Äôt you say that?‚Äù From the look on my son‚Äôs face, I could tell he was warming to the idea of a gender-less or mystery-gendered monster.

‚ÄúAnyway, I think they should wear a cloak and a bowler hat. All the big monsters wear something iconically identifiable‚ÄîJason has a hockey mask, Freddy has a Christmas sweater, Michael Meyers has that Shatner mask, Candyman has that big winter coat, and Dracula has that black cape that‚Äôs red on the inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I see you got ideas,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBoy, are you drawing all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù RJ doodled in deep concentration, the tip of his tongue poking out of the corner of his mouth. ‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äù He held up his notepad and showed us the stick figure he'd drawn of a monster with dagger teeth and what looked like a large, hairy snake around its neck.

‚ÄúIs that a cater‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI love it!‚Äù Lana said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre wearing a black boa!‚Äù

‚ÄúA black boa,‚Äù I said as if that had been obvious. I was glad my daughter had cut me off before I could say ‚Äúcaterpillar.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd glass teeth,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúNo. Diamond teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they have teeth made out of jewelry?‚Äù Lana asked.¬†

I was about to tell my daughter to take it easy on her little brother when RJ responded. ‚ÄúDiamonds are the hardest material known to man!‚Äù He seemed to ponder a moment then asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a Shatner?‚Äù

‚ÄúDiamond sharp teeth.‚Äù I wrote it down and then looked up at my children. ‚ÄúNow what does our mystery monster do? Let‚Äôs make it unique. I had a couple ideas but I was really enjoying what they were coming up with.

Lana and RJ sat quietly in thought. No doubt they were thinking of and passing on monsters that killed horny teenagers, creepy children, bloodsuckers‚Äî

‚ÄúIt gets you when you go to bed,‚Äù RJ said.¬†

‚ÄúYou mean like the Sandman?‚Äù Lana asked and rolled her eyes. Despite her tone, I could tell she was invested in the process.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù RJ said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt get you when you go to sleep or put you to sleep.‚Äù He smiled slyly and looked between his sister and me. ‚ÄúIt gets you if you don‚Äôt go to sleep.‚Äù

That sent a chill up I‚Äôs spine and I cleared my throat and shifted in my chair. I didn‚Äôt think they knew I had problems with insomnia, but then again, I had a history of saying things sometimes without being aware my children were in the room.

‚ÄúOoo, that‚Äôs really good,‚Äù Lana said, grinning. Now I definitely couldn‚Äôt squash the sleep thing.

‚ÄúOkay, so he watches you while you sleep,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDad.‚Äù Lana looked at him. ‚ÄúFirst of all‚Äî*they*‚Äîand second, *they* watch you to make sure you go to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Got it.‚Äù It had been worth trying but Lana wasn‚Äôt as distractible as her brother. I wrote the suggestion down and was eager to wrap up. When I finished, Lana and RJ were staring at me.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù RJ said.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt forget the most important part!‚Äù

For a moment I felt ice pouring down the column of my spine when the thought of them saying in unison, ‚ÄôThey‚Äôre right behind you,‚Äô popped in my head. My children were separated by seven years but there was something very twinnish in the set of their faces at that moment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the most important part?‚Äù

Lana had wrapped her arms in front of her and gestured to her brother for him to say it. ‚ÄúThe name. We gotta give them a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Yeah, we do. What, uhh, what do you guys think?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, Mr. Goodnight. No, wait. That won‚Äôt work, will it, Lana?‚Äù.

‚ÄúHow about, The Goodnighter?‚Äù I said finally. I could tell Lana was folding back into her own angsty world and I'd be losing her shortly. ‚ÄúMaybe they could pluck off a toe if you don‚Äôt go to sleep as a warning. Or better yet‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLame.‚Äù Lana snorted. ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like it.‚Äù RJ gave me a thumb‚Äôs up.

The moment had passed and I collected the notepads and tore out the sheets that RJ and I had used. Lana had participated, but she hadn‚Äôt written or drawn anything in her notepad. That had been about as much as I could have expected.

I noticed the time and quickly put everything away before starting dinner. I was going to make my famous honey and hot sauce chicken that despite her general indifference, even Lana loved.

By the time Trese got home, dinner was ready. I made au gratin potatoes from the box and steamed some green beans. We kissed hello and Trese lassoed the kids into a hug and asked them about their day. RJ rattled off a million details of which the Goodnighter was only a small part and they followed her upstairs. By the time the three of them came back down, four plates were waiting with two glasses of Pinot Grigio and two cups of Faygo Rock ‚Äôn Rye.

‚ÄúIs this for me?‚Äù Lana said with too big of a smile on her face, pretending to belly up in front of a plate with a glass of wine by it. ‚ÄúKidding,‚Äù she said when Trese and I responded with blank looks at her.

All four of us sat and ate together and it was so pleasant that the Goodnighter was mostly forgotten. But it remained a tiny knot somewhere in my brain and no matter how many jokes I told that everyone laughed at, it remained, drawing from me like a tumor. Except it supped my mind, irrigating through synapses, growing not in size but in scope, developing in character like a growing fetus in the womb.

*The Goodnighter watched from the darkest corner in the bedroom, waiting until a random appointed hour when everyone should be asleep. Then it floated out of its sliver of corner, expanding like a balloon, compressing the air in the room into an uncomfortable thickness, the black boa crawling around its neck and cinching into a chokehold aro*und *the creature‚Äôs* *neck. It watched*‚Äî

‚ÄúHoney, where‚Äôd you go?‚Äù

I looked up from the dishes in the sink at my wife. She‚Äôd interrupted whatever had just been going through my mind just then and I'd instantly forgotten what it was.¬†

‚ÄúSorry. Just lost in thought.‚Äù Trese continued staring at me and I realized I was supposed to have responded to something she‚Äôd said. I tried to scramble back over the shaving of words I'd caught and wasn‚Äôt able to put them together into something coherent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, babe. I totally zoned. What did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to go to Margate? You seem hot and cold on it. We could always go to another amusement park. I just figured, it‚Äôs in the UK‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo-no. Yeah. I wanna go.‚Äù I turned to my wife. ‚ÄúI really do. You know me. I need a Xanax to get on a plane and I hate how that makes me feel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm going to be right next to you. You don‚Äôt have anything to worry about.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf only anxiety worked that easily.‚Äù I smiled.¬†

Trese looped two fingers around two of mine. ‚ÄúYou know, if you‚Äôre feeling anxious now‚Ä¶‚Äù She gave me a coy smile. ‚ÄúUnless it doesn‚Äôt work like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no. It works exactly like that.‚Äù

I hustled my wife upstairs. The kids were already showered for the night, my son waiting in bed for a story. Trese gave him a big hug and kiss before saying goodnight to Lana and going into our bedroom for a shower.¬†

‚ÄúGoodnight, bro,‚Äù my son said after I had finished two chapters from the book.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me bro.‚Äù I narrowed my eyes. ‚ÄúOr I will *kill* you where you stand.‚Äù RJ giggled as I leaned in and kissed his forehead before he flopped over on his other side.

Finally, my daughter came out of the main bathroom, her twists up in a bonnet.

‚ÄúG‚Äônight, Daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet dreams, El.‚Äù I kissed her forehead as we passed each other.

‚ÄúGoodnight, RJ,‚Äù she said at her brother‚Äôs threshold.

‚ÄúGoodnight, bro!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your bro.‚Äù She disappeared into her room, rolling her eyes the whole way.

Before I could step fully into my bedroom, I caught sight of my naked wife in silhouette standing just outside of our en suite bathroom. Both our bodies had changed over seventeen years of marriage and two kids (I‚Äôd done more than my fair share of sympathy eating when she‚Äôd been pregnant) but right then I would have preferred this woman to any prior version of her.¬†

‚ÄúI should take a shower‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúClose the door.‚Äù



We lay in bed together after, our hands lingering on one another for several minutes. It had been a while‚Äîwork, kids, life in general. I'd missed her more than I would have thought had I actually thought about it and she had made love to me with an urgency as if our time were limited by one of our own parents who would open the door at any moment.¬†

Trese‚Äôs hand slid off my pudgy belly as she turned over on her side, drifting off into a near uninterruptible slumber. I would have envied her except my lids had steadily been getting heavier by the moment. My breathing deepened as I spooned my body behind hers, one of her perfectly proportioned breasts filling the cup of my hand. I tumbled into sleep, conscious of one last breath before I was gone.



*‚Äîbreathing in impending terror, anticipated agony, eventual dread.*

*The Goodnighter floated just above the floor, the tail of their boa dragging behind their many-toed, filthy feet. I could feel them just beyond the footboard of the bed, the knot that had been in my mind now outside but still attached like a bundle of nerves stringing out of me.*

I kept my eyes shut, hoping to slip back to sleep before they could reach me. The Goodnighter rotated in the air until they were parallel with the bed. I could feel the air between them and me being squeezed as they lowered closer.

I squeezed my eyelids together, counterintuitive to sleep but I couldn‚Äôt help it. The only sound I could hear aside from the susurrus of Trese‚Äôs gentle breathing was the fingernail scratches against the window of the branch I had clipped from the tree at the beginning of spring.

I felt exposed where my body wasn‚Äôt covered by the comforter, my head and neck feeling particularly vulnerable. The arm I considered sacrificeable and my foot should have been fine because I always wore socks to bed.¬†

But then something pinched a toe through my sock. I'd had a cat when I'd been a teenager that would play with my feet, but it had run away when I'd left for college twenty years ago.

The lore that had written itself in my head told me the Goodnighter was plucking off my toe, but that had to be ridiculous. My mind was aggressively playing tricks. Too many consecutive nights of poor sleep were impressing a layer of paranoia upon me. I almost believed I could feel its long, slender fingers flexing my toe back and forth through the clingy film of my imagination just before‚Ä¶¬†

Nothing?

I was tempted to sit up in bed, but the impression still draping over me was so palpable, my irrational fear anchored me to the bed. I slowly pulled the rest of my body beneath the comforter, knowing and not caring I was going to sweat the bed.

I didn‚Äôt want to wake Trese even though the only thing I wanted was my wife‚Äôs comfort. I settled for curling up next to her as Trese‚Äôs breathing deepened.



‚ÄúGood morning, sleepyhead!‚Äù my family shouted in unison as I shambled into the kitchen. I rubbed my eye as I absorbed the sunlight coming in through the deck window, devouring the crumbs of leftover dreams. Trese had the electric griddle on the table with two pancakes on it and was in the process of pouring a third. The kids had scrambled eggs and bacon along with two pancakes each, taken from the growing stack on the plate next to the griddle.

I gave them my best smile as I beelined for the Keurig. Trese already had it loaded with my Walking Dead mug and I grabbed the sugar and a spoon from the drawer.¬†

‚ÄúIt already has‚Äî‚Äù I gave my wife a dead-eye stare as I spooned sugar into my mug. I slapped the Keurig closed and started it. I felt myself coming officially awake as coffee scented the air.

‚ÄúG‚Äômorning, guys,‚Äù I said and sat at the table. ‚ÄúWhat made you do all this?‚Äù Trese wasn‚Äôt much for cooking.

‚ÄúWell, after what you did for me last night, I figured I‚Äôd return the favor.‚Äù She winked at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with your eye?‚Äù RJ asked.

‚ÄúOh god,‚Äù Lana said.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre very welcome, madam,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh *god*.‚Äù

There was bacon at one edge of the griddle and I pinched a couple rashers.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eggs in the fridge if you want some.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I think I‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said, reaching for the pancakes. ‚ÄúOn second thought, you guys‚Äô look good.‚Äù I scooted back from the table, taking my coffee with me as I went to the refrigerator and rooted around for the eggs. I kept meaning to arrange everything in here and putting it off. The shelves could also use a cleaning and I was relatively sure there was an opened bottle of mini pickles in the back that had been there since RJ was a baby.

I backed out of the fridge with two eggs and something about the pan with the remnants of the scrambled eggs still in it made me think of last night. That crazy dream with the monster the kids and I had made up.

But wait, why did I remember drifting off to sleep after then? I'd briefly fallen asleep after Trese and I had made love, but that was always more of a nap. I recalled tossing around until I'd gotten comfortable with half my upper body from underneath the covers. Then it came.

No. Then *they* came.

Detail filled my mind like one of those old computers that flashed nonsensical data as they booted up. The scratching at the window by a branch that was no longer there, the air thickening, and something touching my toe.¬†

Them *pinching* my toe.

But that had been just my imagination leisurely galloping, unbridled by my command. It hadn‚Äôt been real.

*It hadn‚Äôt been real.*

I looked down at my foot, still with the sock on I'd worn to bed. I wiggled my toes.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were all there.

I am a regular in a theatre cafe in my home town. I ask for a pot of tea, and ask for the pot to be warmed up. If I am lucky, the person there knows what I mean and will warm the pot up. If I am unlucky it is a young hipster that looks at me like I am mad, saying something like ""it will be warm because there is hot water going into it"". And because I dont want a long discussion, I end up with tepid tea. ( I have tried explaining in the past). 

This is common in most cafes now anyway  - they are geared up for serving coffee.

This is why I like the pot to be heated up, because otherwise:

\- The 'hot' water comes from an urn or boiler - so is not boiling  
\- The teapot is cold so when the warm water goes into it , it cools down, especially if the pot has thick walls  
\- The cup is cold , so when the teapot comes to the table and I pour it into the cup it's colder  
 \- the milk is cold , so when that is poured in the tea is tepid basically.

   
Since England doesn't have many culinary items that it is famous for, it would be nice to get the tea right!!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I‚Äôd go through stretches where I slept perfectly like a king on a cloud, then I'd randomly hit a wall. I‚Äôd toss and turn, wake up groggy, and try to ‚Äúpush through‚Äù brain fog and exhaustion.

So about 1.5 years ago, I decided to go all in on good good consistent sleep no excuses and use habit tracking to see what improves or decreases sleep quality. I started to treat it like a skill to be learned instead of a random Mario mystery box.üòÇ

I'm a 35 yr old male with no kids (parents feel free to ignore everything I know your life has many more challenges and is much harder to predict.)

My fault for the long post, I'm obsessed with sleep optimization like I'm guessing most of you are feel free to disregard or skip down to the TLDR at the bottom.

Here‚Äôs what I changed.

# 1. Environment: Building a Bedroom That Triggers Sleep

**Here‚Äôs my setup now:**

* **Essentia mattress (non-toxic memory foam)** ‚Äî no chemical off-gassing or heat buildup.
* **Chili Sleep cooling pad**: each side has its own temperature control. It‚Äôs cheaper than cooling the whole house, and even a 1‚Äì2¬∞F drop in core body temp triggers drowsiness.
* **Room temperature**: drops to \~70¬∞F about 30 minutes before bed. Research shows your core temperature naturally falls as you approach sleep ‚Äî so I ‚Äúassist‚Äù it.
* **Air quality**: I crack a window or sliding door to release and prevent CO‚ÇÇ buildup and use an AirDoctor purifier for particulates. Poor air quality elevates resting heart rate and decreases deep sleep.
* **Sound and light**: I use [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/) ‚Äî their AI-generated functional music increases delta brainwave activity (the frequency range of slow wave sleep). And an insanely comfortable [contoured sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KC5DWCC) blocks light completely without pressing on my eyelids.

One important: **I only use my bed for sleep and sex.**  
No reading, no scrolling, no work. My body now associates the bed with shutting down. It‚Äôs pavlovian conditioning and it works.

# 2. Light Exposure: Teaching My Brain When It‚Äôs Day and Night

As you probably know light is the master controller of circadian rhythm. Every cell in your body runs on a 24-hour clock, and light ‚Äî especially through your eyes ‚Äî tells your brain what time it is.

**My rhythm:**

* **Wake up:** 5:10 AM (¬±10 minutes). I get bright artificial light for 3‚Äì4 minutes immediately. Usually from my bathroom light but I'm considering getting a sun lamp as well. Then I drink water to rehydrate.
* **Bedtime:** 8:10 PM. On weekends, I try to stretch it by no more than an hour. I try to keep the schedule consistent
* **Evening light:** At 7:30 PM, a red ‚Äúsunset‚Äù bulb turns on automatically ‚Äî this mimics low solar angle light and signals to my brain (via the suprachiasmatic nucleus) that it‚Äôs time to wind down. I got the bulb from bon charge.

Then I put on blue-light-blocking glasses and my phone automatically switches to black and white mode. Those cues reduce dopamine stimulation from screens, making it easier to transition into sleepiness.

**Why this matters:**  
Light viewed in the first 30‚Äì60 minutes after waking triggers a cortisol pulse that sets your internal timer for sleep \~16 hours later. Conversely, light after 10 PM can *delay* your circadian clock ‚Äî even a few minutes of bright light can shift your rhythm by an hour.

# 3. Mindset & Stress: Learning to Downshift the Nervous System

A misconception about sleep is that you can just ‚Äúturn your brain off.‚Äù But if your nervous system is still in sympathetic mode (fight or flight), good luck. You can create a more relaxed brain state but it takes practice.

Letting go of control  
Also paradoxically I became obsessed with the system and process of setting up for a good night of sleep but completely detached from the outcome. I don't stress myself out with the thought of trying to sleep well. If I don't sleep well it's all good, it doesn't matter, all I can do is prepare my body I can't control the outcome. This creates the relaxation needed for sleep.

Here‚Äôs what I do to intentionally switch into chill mode also known as parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) mode:

* **Meditation every morning**: it trains my mind to notice thoughts without reacting. Over time, this carries into bedtime ‚Äî I can feel my body relax when I notice myself tensing. I also don't have to ruminate or chase thoughts they are nothing but events flitting about the mind no action is needed on them.
* **Gratitude journaling in the evening**: I reflect on 2‚Äì3 positive things before bed to create a more calm and joyful mind state
* **Reading** ‚Äî calm input before rest. To be 100% transparent I also usually watch TV while cuddling with my wife before bed while wearing blue light blocking glasses. This routine is relaxing.
* **Topical magnesium spray** on the neck along the vagus nerve and wrists: magnesium helps regulate GABA, the neurotransmitter that calms the nervous system. I apply it where absorption is fastest (veins close to skin).
* **Breathwork and cold exposure**: these rewire my stress response. Breath training protocols help me to lower heart rate quickly and enter relaxation a skill that directly translates to falling asleep faster.

The ability to deliberately turn off alertness is a superpower.

# 4. Exercise: Tire the Body, But Don‚Äôt Overexert

I love lifting in the morning for about 50 minutes followed by 10 minutes in the sauna. It is energizing to get the blood flowing early.

Weekends are for outdoor play: pickleball, hiking, surfing, volleyball ‚Äî all great for light exposure and mental reset.

One rule I follow: **no hard training within 4 hours of bedtime.**  
Late-night workouts raise body temp and adrenaline. It‚Äôs like hitting the gas before parking the car, you won‚Äôt fall asleep easily and you'll put extra strain on the system.

# 5. Diet, Hydration, and Alcohol

I knew what I ate affects my sleep, but when I eat matters just as much.

I eat my **last meal around 5 PM**, at least three hours before bed. Digestion raises body temperature, which delays melatonin release. I also stop drinking water by 4 PM so that I don't get up to pee at night. I still make sure to drink at least 64 oz.

Caffeine?  
About once every two weeks. I like the brain and health benefits but don't want to become dependent. I want my natural energy to tell me the truth about my recovery. When I feel tired, I don‚Äôt reach for coffee to mask the tiredness, I try fix the root cause by taking a nap... and I take note of what I did the day before so that I can avoid low energy in the future. However, some days it doesn't matter if I have low energy so I don't obsess. I.e. if I'm on vacation I don't worry to much if the battery isn't topped off. There is a balance to striving for good habits and being flexible.

Alcohol  
I mostly avoid it, I drink maybe twice a month. Alcohol fragments sleep and suppresses REM. When I do drink, I try to stick to daytime and use **ZBiotics and NAD+** to support help my body process the booze and lessen its impact. (Fun fact: NAD levels drop with age, and lower NAD makes it harder for the body to process alcohol, and is linked to poor cellular repair not ideal for recovery.)

Interesting note, when I was in Italy, wine with dinner didn‚Äôt wreck my sleep like it does in the U.S. This is likely caused by difference in food regulation. The FDA is comically lax with what they allow companies to put in our food and drink when compared to Europe.

# üìä 6. Tracking & Data: Removing Guesswork

I‚Äôve worn a WHOOP band for about five years. It tracks HRV (heart rate variability), resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep performance. Before this I used the ""sleep as android"" phone app to track my sleep. There are plenty of trackers that can monitor sleep and recovery.

HRV is the hidden gem metric. It measures the time variation between heartbeats while you‚Äôre asleep ‚Äî higher variability means your nervous system is flexible and balanced.

When my HRV trends upward and my resting heart rate trends down, I know I‚Äôm recovering well. I try to create as large a gap as possible between resting heart rate and HRV. When HRV dips, it‚Äôs usually because I broke a rule ‚Äî heavy meal too late, alcohol too close to bed, or screen time at night.

WHOOP also measures sleep efficiency (time asleep vs time in bed) and consistency (how regular your sleep schedule is).

Patterns emerged fast. Once I saw the data visualized, I stopped arguing with reality.

My biggest sleep score boosters:

* Limiting alcohol
* Eating 3+ hours before bed
* Going to bed and waking at the same time
* Meditation
* Blue-light blocking glasses

I also have a list of 20+ habits that I document daily so I know what effects my sleep. For example each day I will track how long I exercised, morning light exposure, did I eat processed food, time of eating, how stressed was I, am I injured, hydration, etc. This is correlated with how rested I was the next morning so I know what to avoid and what do keep doing. I have eliminated my sleep disruptors.

You can use a tool like [Sleep blueprint](https://admin.typeform.com/form/qoMSWstN/create?block=ed28f323-6322-438d-b623-87883fe7e60e) to uncover your biggest sleep disruptors and get a personalized plan to fix them. It costs money though and you could probably find the same information for free online if you poked around enough for a sleep hygiene quiz or something similar.

# 7. Transformation: Predictable Energy = Freedom

Before optimizing these factors, my sleep quality felt random. Now, I can predict how I‚Äôll sleep based on the day‚Äôs habits and how my body feels... and I can plan around it.

If I have a big presentation or long day ahead, I know how to guarantee deep, restorative sleep the night before. If I want to stay out late with friends, I can build recovery on both sides so it barely dents me.

Sleep is the foundation that holds everything else together ‚Äî workouts, discipline, mood, creativity. It‚Äôs the ultimate leverage point.

Eating correctly and exercising are pointless without good sleep. Sleeping well makes it easier to do every other health habit because it gives you will power and motivation. For that same reason it is essential to reaching my goals and pursuing my life‚Äôs purpose. Without proper energy everything is harder. I can either experience the pain of discipline to dial in my sleep or the pain of regret of a life wasted or even a mediocre life where I drift through mindlessly following the status quo.

And I‚Äôve found that to be true. With consistent, restorative sleep, I wake up motivated with deep reserves of will power.

If your sleep feels inconsistent, the best place to start isn‚Äôt another supplement or gadget ‚Äî it‚Äôs figuring out what‚Äôs actually disrupting it. Find out what specific things for you are creating issues. I've found generic advice to be annoying, I'd rather know what is bothering me specifically and then only fix those things.

Nothing better than laying in bed and knowing a great night of sleep is inevitable.

# TL;DR

Treat sleep like a skill.

* Build a cool, dark, clean environment.
* Expose your eyes to light early, and protect them from blue light late.
* Teach your nervous system to downshift.
* Time food, exercise, and stress intentionally.
* Track and adjust.

When you align those levers, deep, restorative sleep every night becomes the norm not the exception. Happy optimizing don't let good sleep be a dream make it real!

I am facing a weird problem. I created some shortcuts to calculate my average daily intake for a week, e.g., daily Water Average for a certain week. In the end, I want to output the stats for all metrics of interest for a given week, like in the example for Water and Coffee.
However, when I run both shortcuts automatically from the ‚Äûmaster‚Äú shortcut, it seems like the second shortcut is entirely skipping some days. Why is causing this weird behavior?

What I have tried so far:
1. running the master shortcut with each metric -> everything calculated as expected
2. swapping the sequence of shortcuts -> only the first shortcuts runs correctly with all the days of the week, the second always seems to ‚Äûmiss‚Äú some days
3. I added a 5 second delay between each shortcut -> still the same

Note:
Each shortcut works correctly on its own and does the same thing, with the only difference being the health data it refers to.",4,1760537990.0,shortcuts,0,1.0,False

The air smells like cut grass and soap bubbles. Sunlight filters through the high glass windows, soft and forgiving, painting gold halos on the floor.

¬†

Jeffy¬†and¬†Delaney¬†are in the middle of the courtyard, building a kingdom out of sidewalk chalk and plastic dinosaurs. Their laughter rises and falls like music, sudden, unpredictable, but always on key.

¬†

Desdemona¬†sits on a bench nearby, an untouched cup of coffee cooling in her hands. Beside her,¬†Angel leans back with his eyes half closed, his cane resting against the bench. The afternoon hums gently around them a rare calm in the storm of life‚Äôs heartbeat.

¬†

Jeffy squeals as Delaney draws a massive rainbow across the concrete. They step back to admire it, grinning, faces smudged with chalk dust and sunlight.

¬†

Desdemona¬†stands, watching. She feels good. Tired in the right way, full of color. The kind of tired that means you¬†did¬†something.

¬†

Then it starts.

¬†

A shift. Small, but unmistakable.

¬†

At first it feels like the world exhales too deeply. The air folds in on itself. Sound softens around the edges. Laughter, birds, Angel‚Äôs voice are all still there, but strangely distant, like they‚Äôre coming from behind glass.

¬†

Her vision brightens, not dims‚Ä¶ the colors sharpen until they‚Äôre almost¬†too much.¬†The pink chalk glows, the grass hums green, the sky bleeds a syrupy blue. Everything is¬†flat¬†and vivid, as if someone ironed reality and forgot to stop.

¬†

She blinks.

¬†

Nothing moves quite right anymore. Every gesture looks rehearsed. Like a bad stage play she‚Äôs suddenly trapped inside. The sun glints on Angel‚Äôs cane, and even that looks deliberate, theatrical.

¬†

She tries to say his name, but her tongue is made of clay. Her arms float, detached from meaning.

¬†

A ripple goes through her vision and suddenly she‚Äôs in a dream folding over itself. The ground tilts, the light bends, and her heartbeat thunders up into her skull.

¬†

There‚Äôs no panic now, not really. Just a deep, slow awe. A strange thought drifts through her mind:¬†So this is it again. The dream inside the world.

¬†

The voices around her distort‚Ä¶ drawn out, underwater. Jeffy‚Äôs laughter stretches into music, sweet and far away. Angel‚Äôs shout echoes as if from another lifetime.

¬†

Her knees buckle. The last thing she sees is the chalk dragon bright and alive beneath her feet. The creature seems to lift off the pavement, scales shimmering, wings unfurling.

¬†

Then everything goes white. Sweet, soft, merciful oblivion.

¬†

A little while later‚Ä¶

¬†

Jeffy and Delaney are still at their chalk kingdom. Their laughter floats, light as bubbles. Desdemona and Angel are still at their bench, watching.

¬†

Angel glances over at Dez: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking loud again.‚Äù

¬†

Dez laughs softly: ‚ÄúI was just‚Ä¶ remembering what it feels like to be that small. When everything‚Äôs a miracle.‚Äù

¬†

Angel laughs: ‚ÄúStill is. We just forget to look.‚Äù

¬†

Delaney has moved on to decorating Jeffy‚Äôs sneakers with tiny stars. Jeffy holds perfectly still, like he‚Äôs being painted for a royal portrait.

¬†

Dez tilts her head: ‚ÄúThey make it look so easy. Joy. Like breathing.‚Äù

¬†

Angel hums: ‚ÄúKids don‚Äôt know how to edit their wonder. We do. We start putting warnings on it.‚Äù

¬†

Dez chuckles, eyes glinting: ‚ÄúMine says,¬†May cause dizziness and loss of balance.‚Äù

¬†

Angel grins: ‚ÄúMine says,¬†Handle with care. Contents may explode.‚Äù

¬†

They laugh and it feels like exhaling something heavy.

¬†

Jeffy looks up, spotting them: ‚ÄúMom! Mr. Angel! Come see! We made a dragon!‚Äù

¬†

On the ground, the chalk drawing sprawls a bright, messy creature with green wings and a crooked tail, breathing swirls of pink fire.

¬†

Dez stands, brushing invisible crumbs from her jeans. She takes a few careful steps forward, grounding herself in the rhythm she‚Äôs learned to trust: breathe, blink, step, smile.

¬†

Desdemona crouches beside them: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs beautiful! What‚Äôs his name?‚Äù

¬†

Delaney whispers, proud and solemn: ‚ÄúHis name is Wonder.‚Äù

¬†

Dez looks at the dragon. Then at them. Then at the sunlight tracing colors across the concrete.

¬†

For a long moment, the world feels balanced. The seizures, the scars, the stubborn ache of being human all small compared to the simple, blazing miracle of two children drawing dragons in the light.

¬†

Angel watches her watching them. He doesn‚Äôt say anything he doesn‚Äôt need to.

¬†

Because right then,¬†Desdemona remembers that having epilepsy doesn‚Äôt mean losing wonder.¬†It just means learning how to hold it gently.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o7c65g,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1o7c65g/poor_uk_tea_quality_in_cafe_warming_up_the_pot/,Poor UK Tea Quality in Cafe & warming up the pot,"This is a real pet peeve of mine , so partly venting and partly looking for advice...!

I am a regular in a theatre cafe in my home town. I ask for a pot of tea, and ask for the pot to be warmed up. If I am lucky, the person there knows what I mean and will warm the pot up. If I am unlucky it is a young hipster that looks at me like I am mad, saying something like ""it will be warm because there is hot water going into it"". And because I dont want a long discussion, I end up with tepid tea. ( I have tried explaining in the past). 

This is common in most cafes now anyway  - they are geared up for serving coffee.

This is why I like the pot to be heated up, because otherwise:

\- The 'hot' water comes from an urn or boiler - so is not boiling  
\- The teapot is cold so when the warm water goes into it , it cools down, especially if the pot has thick walls  
\- The cup is cold , so when the teapot comes to the table and I pour it into the cup it's colder  
 \- the milk is cold , so when that is poured in the tea is tepid basically.

   
Since England doesn't have many culinary items that it is famous for, it would be nice to get the tea right!!  
I am right to want a nice hot tea when i pay for it in a cafe or am I just a potty complaining Dad?",1,1760537690.0,tea,5,0.6,False

1o7c61u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrematureEjaculation/comments/1o7c61u/serotonin_discovery/,Serotonin discovery,"Lifelong PE, 31yo, 20 seconds IELT.

Tried everything but the curious thing is serotonin never was a problem apparently. SSRIs had no big effect, 5htp etc. Recently experienced a decent control after taking 250ml of coffee. Decided to replicate the experience and it seems consistent. After some researches figures my PE would be more dopamine/norepinephrine driven. So I‚Äôve figured a stack that consistently give me a decent control: 

400mg L-Theanine
200mg Cafeine 
1000mg Taurine

This makes me calm, with sharp control. I also did the Male Definitive Guide which is mostly responsible for my results. Now I start slow (around 1 second per thrust) during 10 minutes then I can play with deep and fast pace for around 50 seconds before reaching PONR. Go slow to reset and loop through it. And that is it, I can last indefinitely. 


Ah it‚Äôs an on demand stack, around 60 minutes before sex. And btw my partner is good with 5~ minutes, so going way too long won‚Äôt work for her but it‚Äôs good to have the control anyways.
