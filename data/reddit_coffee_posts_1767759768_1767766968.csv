My girlfriend and I are considering a move to the Sacramento area since she focusing her job search in this area. We are insterested in areas between West Sac and Rancho Cordova. We’re currently based in Fresno and, as POCs, we’re also curious about how welcoming different neighborhoods might feel.

We’d be renting (not buying), so we’re especially interested in:

•	Good areas for renting apartments

•	Neighborhoods to avoid (if any)

•	Recommendations for food, coffee shops, and fun local spots

I've been wanting to start intermittent fasting for a while and have been trying it out for a month now, though a bit loosely where I let myself break it it's a special day (with the holidays there wasn't much else I could do!).

I'm doing a 16:8 schedule, and my fast ends at 2pm (it's the best way to work with my life schedule).   But I still drink one cup of coffee in the morning, around 9am.  I initially just thought it's a small enough (milk worth about 20 calories), and regular enough bit of food that it wouldn't really mess me up in any way, and as far as I can tell I've been fine- I don't feel hungry much outside of my fasting period at all.  In that way my fasting period is sort of more like 11 hours, one cup of coffee, 5 hours, and then freedom for 8 hours.

However, I'm sort of worried that it's messing something up internally?  I'm not completely sure about how IF works outside of just helping you limit how much you eat by limiting when you eat and controlling your hunger.  Would having a cup of coffee in the morning in any way negatively impact my weight loss?  Am I functionally doing a 11:13 fast, and breaking the fast in the morning makes the rest of my fasting until 2pm worthless?

1q67q0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1q67q0f/rank_my_vegan_soy_protein_powder/,Rank my vegan soy protein powder,"Hey guys, these are the vegan soy protein powder that ive used. Ive switched to the soy protein since last Sep, cuz I want to change the protein source. Until now, there’s nth different with the pea one, and some of them even taste better. I’m still using THE VEGAN protein powder now, if you have any other good brand please dont hesitate to share!

* NOW Foods Sports Nutrition, Soy Protein Isolate 20 g, Unflavored Powder

Protein: 20g  Taste: 3/5  Overall:3.5/5

This is my first soy protein, I bought it cuz it’s the most well-known one. First, I don’t really like the taste cuz it’s really ""healthy"" to me, even I added oat milk or fruits, it doesn’t help at all. But the price is really nice tho, $49 with 2 pound it’s already good for me. The amount of protein just in the average,It can blend well if I use the blending stick, not really good if just shake it.

* THE VEGAN Plant Based Protein Powder (vanilla)

(Taiwan brand)

Protein: 28g Taste: 5/5 Overall: 4.5/5

I found this brand unintentionally; it seems like a new brand but it’s already been famous in Taiwan. I already tried the coffee, oat milk, vanilla. And my fav is the oat milk.I was not really interested in it before until I found out its flavors are really cool. This is my first time trying oat milk flavor and it really taste like one! Added coffee, cereals, fruits even make it better! it would be blended well if I use the blending stick too, with shaking it’s also fine but need to drink it quickly. But the problem is the price, $49 with 2.2lb it’s a little pricey for me, but I think it’s also makes sense since it’s a foreign brand, About the protein amount, this one is 28g, but the number will be different if the flavor changes, the highest one is 28g (plant flavor). It’s also added vitamins and probiotics etc, all nutrition in one it is. I bought the plain flavor this time since it’s on sale, I would recommend this brand if you want to try soy protein!

* Naturade Total Soy Protein Powder, Vanilla

Protein; 13g, Taste:3/5 Overall:4/5

This one it’s also well-known, so I am excited to try it. First, the taste it’s too sweet for me, I think it’s cuz the sweetener they choose, Im not really into this taste.. but the chocolate one is better! What’s good is, the price is very very good! I think it would be the cheapest of these three. It can help me to stay full and be a meal replacement. I think I would but it again if I’m out of budget.",1,1767766308.0,fitmeals,0,1.0,False

1q67k2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q67k2d/twelve_point/,Twelve point,"I hadn’t gone hunting since my father died. I finally decided to go on a trip as a remembrance of him. On September 15, 1992, with my friend Erik, we set out for 5 miles to our camping spot. On the trail, we talked about life, and how much it means to me that he’s out here with me.

The woods were quiet. Though the crickets were chirping, the larger game made no noise. The birds singing their sweet songs to each other were nowhere to be heard. The chirping of squirrels and chipmunks jumping from tree to tree was nowhere to be heard. I thought it was odd but paid no mind to the situation further.

We finally made it to the stand where my father and I perched atop. My young life consisting of moving too much, and drinking a soda, while he sipped his coffee, scaring away any potential bucks, because I needed to get down and relieve myself of a full bladder from the copious amount of cans. I stood there reminiscing of my first kill. It wasn’t a clean kill. It ran for another 20 feet before it collapsed, and I had to end its suffering with my knife. I made sure to use every part of that deer for what I inflicted upon it. My first young love breaking my heart. And the life I lived with the woman I’m grateful to call my wife. And the loss of my grandparents.

Tomorrow I would make him proud with all he taught me. But today we set up. Though it was just beans and jerky we ate, it felt good. The nostalgic primal feeling was a great reminder of the decades we spent together just like this.

I miss you, Dad.

4AM we marked out our trail cameras and made our way back. Nightly songbirds were considerably vocal this time of the morning. When the first light dimmed across the landscape, the forest life ceased to exist. The only audible noise was the labored breathing of Erik and me. The wind was blowing though the trees weren’t swaying, standing like a statue across acres that my eye can comprehend.

I jumped at the sight of a 12-point pair of antlers emerging standing behind a brush of grass. I estimated the area of the lungs. Held my breath. And took the shot. It shot up on its hind legs as it passed and fell into the brush like a snap of a finger. Life came back to the forest. Satisfied with my kill, I went down to retrieve him. Pushed away the brush, and was met with a small puddle of blood, but no buck. The metallic stench pierced my nose, like the air shifted into a cocktail of molten metal and sulfur. It couldn’t have gotten away; the clearing was too small for us not to notice it leaping away.

We looked around for the injured animal. We walked about 50 feet from our stand but never saw it again. We ventured out further, another 10 feet, but never found it. When the daylight dimmed, we decided to fall back to our camp. We’ll find it tomorrow. I thought.

When I went to bed, the similar sensation of complete silence pierced my ears. The only sounds came from the occasional animal breaking a twig, or climbing one of the trees, or worst of all, Erik snoring.

When I managed to drift off, that pungent odor stung my nose again, and soon after, Erik’s as well.

“Aw Jesus, what’s that smell?” he asked. I shrugged my shoulders and grabbed my light, as well as my gun. He did too. We walked out to see the deer staring at us between two trees. Its beady black eyes, fixed on us, as we did to it. The bullet hole on its right shoulder muscle oozed blood in black and shiny red. I guess I had missed. Erik raised his gun; as soon as he raised the barrel to the deer’s head, the deer bared its teeth and snarled at us like it was a wolf. What kind of deer fucking snarls?

It sprang backwards and galloped. I say galloped, but it was more like a kid doing a bear crawl, but if that kid had bones fused together. We both looked at each other, confused and a little scared. We both agreed to leave as soon as the morning light came. If that one was like that, how many other deer were? Shit, how many other animals? Maybe that’s why nature left. I didn’t sleep well that night. I swear I heard my father’s voice calling me. Like my thoughts earlier were so vivid I could hear our conversations actually coming from the tree stand outside. The “atta boy”s and the “keep your voice down” coming from above me. Hell, even the conversations that me and Erik had, just a few hours ago. It left me confused. So far that I didn’t realize when the sun came up. And Erik had already started packing his stuff. Eventually, I gained my composure and joined him.

When we started on the trail, I thought I saw that damn deer staring at us. But when I turned my head to focus, it was just a weirdly shaped stick. Or a rock that just so happened to be shaped like a deer head off the hill’s edge. Just halfway from our trucks, we heard yelling coming from the trees. A young woman screaming, “HELP!” at the top of her lungs. “MY BABY!” could be heard after.

We ran to the voice, but when we reached the sound, she would scream from behind us. Then we would run back. Back and forth, back and forth. Until we heard a loud growl from something, followed by a crack, then silence.

We never found the woman. I don’t even think there was a woman.

We panicked and ran. I don’t know where, I don’t know in what direction. Dodging trees and roots, rocks and overgrown mounds, the only thing we heard was the stomping of our feet, and the pleading breath leaving our bodies. We heard growling from behind us, above us. I panicked and missed a root, my ankle rolled, and 165+ pounds crushed into my unsuspecting ankle. I fell onto my shoulder and gripped it in pain. Erik picked me up and heaved me to my feet, practically dragging me until he collapsed from exhaustion. He walked ahead a little ways. One second he’s standing, the next his head is bloody, and he falls backwards, his head making a loud crack when he hits the ground. He’s dead.

That brings me to now. My ankle is definitely broken. I am writing this because I know I’m lost and desperate. I haven’t eaten in five days. I tried to shoot myself, but the guns… While I slept, I hear it snapping sticks, clawing at trees. But while writing, the deer is watching me.",2,1767765748.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

For much the same reason that I love sitting on a bench mid hike, spending a few moments pondering whom else may have stopped to rest there over the years. 

I feel less alone in those moments. 

I feel safe assuming that most every emotion has sat on that bench at some point. Fluttering hearts on a walk about together, a soul with ringing ears from the cacophony of busyness that somehow seems to shout even when its reality is just too many lines inked in on a calendar. 

Confusion, conflict, sadness, loss, joy, and celebration have all likely spent time on the bench, and whatever I bring to it is likely neither the first, nor the last time the trees will hold space for the human, as the bench holds the human. 

Footprints in the snow feel the same. I imagine them being left by a joyful coffee sipper having a quiet morning, a blinded walk from a to b to check off another task, or someone simply on their daily stroll that keeps their body from falling prey to the lack of lumbar support found on their office chair that claims a sleeps worth of time from their day.

And so I feel less alone. 

Because often times the walk spent trying to find answers is made longer by the thought that “this shouldn’t be this hard” or “everyone else seems to just know what to do.” 

Incredibly convincing thoughts, that while strong in the moment, seem to have a very hard time surviving a few minutes on a bench.

Trip details:

	•	Travel date: Dec 18

	•	Routing: Toronto (YYZ) → Vancouver (YVR) → Brisbane → Adelaide

	•	Scheduled arrival in Adelaide: Dec 20 at 16:20

	•	Actual arrival: Dec 21 at 21:00 (over 28 hours late)

What happened:

	1.	My departure from YYZ was delayed, which caused me to miss my connection in YVR.

	2.	On arrival in YVR there were no Air Canada staff available in the terminal to assist with rebooking or guidance.

	3.	While going to baggage services, I realized I had left my carry-on and essential refrigerated prescription medication on board. The medication had been stored in the flight attendant refrigerator.

	4.	Baggage staff retrieved my carry-on but told me they could not access the refrigerator and that the medication could not be retrieved at that time. I was advised at around 2:30 a.m. to return to the airport later in the day “for a chance” to get it back.

	5.	Air Canada-issued ground transportation failed when the Uber was cancelled by the driver, so I paid out of pocket to reach the hotel. Because my rebooked flight wasn’t until late evening, I also had to pay a hotel late checkout fee ($95). No return transport was arranged, so I paid again to get back to the airport.

	6.	I was later told the medication had been found and would be returned to me, but I ended up having to pay personally for FedEx shipping. It was sent to my Ontario address and arrived a week later, not overnight.

	7.	I had purchased a fully paid business-class ticket and selected a specific seat. After the missed connection I was reassigned to a different seat in the front cabin without being offered any alternatives. For me this was a significantly worse seat due to galley light and traffic, and I would not have chosen it.

	8.	Onboard service on the long-haul segment was inconsistent. At one point when I asked for a coffee, I was told by a flight attendant that they had just come off break and couldn’t deal with me at that moment.

	9.	In Brisbane, deboarding was delayed due to agricultural inspections. I advised staff I had a tight connection and was told “maybe run then.”

	10.	Between baggage delays, a 2.5-hour security line, a broken baggage belt, and a bus transfer to the domestic terminal, I missed my onward flight.

	11.	During rebooking attempts, Air Canada’s business chat provided information that did not match the actual flight situation, including telling me I could still make a flight that had already departed.

	12.	I finally arrived in Adelaide at 21:00 on Dec 21, more than 28 hours later than scheduled.

Additional issue:

Because of the multiple involuntary rebookings, I’ve also lost the ability to manage my ticket online as a Business Class Flexible fare. An Air Canada agent confirmed that I now have to call in for changes instead of using the normal self-service options, which is frustrating given the price of the ticket.

Current status:

I’ve submitted a formal complaint to Air Canada requesting:

	•	APPR delay compensation

	•	Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses

	•	Consideration for loss of seat choice, mishandling of medication, and loss of flexible fare features

I have documentation and screenshots of the business chat if needed.

My question:

For those who’ve dealt with Air Canada and APPR claims —

	•	How long did your compensation process take?

	•	Did you have to escalate to the CTA?

	•	Any advice on what to expect or how to strengthen the claim?

Thanks in advance — just looking for practical guidance.",0,1767765411.0,Flights,5,0.5,False

# Benefits of Using SwiftToolsKit

# Cross-Platform Accessibility

One of the most significant advantages of web-based tool platforms is their inherent cross-platform nature. SwiftToolsKit functions identically on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices. This universality means users can access their tools from any device with a web browser and internet connection, whether they're working from a desktop workstation, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

This flexibility supports modern work patterns where professionals frequently switch between devices throughout their day. A project started on a desktop computer can be continued on a tablet during a commute, then finalized on a smartphone during a coffee break. The seamless experience across devices eliminates friction and maintains productivity regardless of circumstance.

# Cost-Effectiveness

Traditional software applications often require substantial upfront investments or ongoing subscription fees for individual tools. SwiftToolsKit's approach consolidates multiple utilities into a single platform, potentially offering these capabilities at a fraction of the cost of acquiring equivalent desktop software.

For freelancers, small businesses, and individual users, this cost-effectiveness can be transformative. Instead of choosing between necessary tools based on budget constraints, users gain access to comprehensive functionality that supports diverse workflows and projects. This democratization of tools levels the playing field, enabling smaller operations to compete with larger organizations that historically had access to expensive software suites.

Desktop applications consume storage space, require regular updates, and can conflict with other software or operating system updates. SwiftToolsKit eliminates these concerns entirely. Users never need to download installers, wait for updates to complete, or troubleshoot compatibility issues. The platform handles all maintenance server-side, ensuring users always access the latest, most secure versions of tools without any action on their part.

This approach also benefits IT departments in organizational settings. Without desktop applications to manage, deploy, and support, IT teams can focus on more strategic initiatives rather than routine software maintenance tasks.

# Instant Results and Efficiency

Web-based tools typically process tasks server-side using powerful infrastructure optimized for specific operations. This architecture often delivers results faster than equivalent desktop applications running on user hardware, particularly for resource-intensive operations like video encoding, image processing, or complex calculations.

The immediate availability of results supports iterative workflows where users experiment with different parameters or approaches. Rather than waiting for lengthy processing times, users receive instant feedback that enables rapid refinement and optimization.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

Reputable online tool platforms implement robust security measures to protect user data. Encryption during transmission (HTTPS) ensures that files and information remain confidential while traveling between user devices and platform servers. Many platforms also implement automatic data deletion policies, removing processed files after a specified period to minimize privacy risks.

However, users should always review privacy policies and terms of service to understand how their data is handled. For highly sensitive information, organizations may prefer tools with specific compliance certifications or those that offer on-premises deployment options.

# Use Cases Across Industries

Financial professionals, entrepreneurs, and business managers use calculation tools for budgeting, loan analysis, and investment planning. The ability to quickly calculate percentages, compound interest, or profit margins supports informed decision-making and financial planning.

Marketing teams leverage URL builders, QR code generators, and text formatting tools to create campaigns, track performance, and engage audiences effectively. The comprehensive nature of platforms like SwiftToolsKit means marketing professionals can execute campaigns without juggling multiple specialized applications.

# Personal Projects and Daily Tasks

Beyond professional applications, online tool platforms serve countless personal needs. Home improvement enthusiasts convert measurements when following international instructions. Travelers convert currencies and time zones. Home cooks adjust recipe quantities using ratio calculators. These everyday applications demonstrate how versatile tool platforms have become integral to modern life.

# The Technology Behind SwiftToolsKit

While users interact with simple, intuitive interfaces, sophisticated technology powers platforms like SwiftToolsKit behind the scenes. Modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript enable rich, responsive interfaces that rival desktop applications in functionality and user experience.

Server-side processing leverages cloud infrastructure that scales dynamically based on demand. During peak usage periods, additional computational resources automatically engage to maintain performance, while quieter periods scale back to optimize efficiency and cost.

Content delivery networks (CDNs) distribute platform assets across global server networks, ensuring fast load times regardless of user location. This geographical distribution also improves reliability; if one server experiences issues, others seamlessly handle requests.

Progressive web application (PWA) technologies enable offline functionality for certain tools, allowing users to continue working even when internet connectivity is temporarily unavailable. Service workers cache essential resources and synchronize data when connections restore, providing a more resilient user experience.

# Privacy and Data Security

In an era of increasing concern about data privacy and security, reputable online tool platforms implement comprehensive measures to protect user information. End-to-end encryption ensures that files uploaded for processing remain confidential during transmission. Industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols create secure connections between user devices and platform servers.

Many platforms adopt zero-knowledge architectures where possible, processing data without retaining copies on servers. Automatic deletion policies remove processed files after short retention periods, typically ranging from minutes to hours, minimizing the window of potential exposure.

Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) demonstrates commitment to user privacy rights. These frameworks require transparency about data collection practices, user consent mechanisms, and the ability for users to access, modify, or delete their information.

Users should still exercise caution when processing sensitive information through web-based tools. For highly confidential data, organizations may prefer tools with additional security certifications or those that can be deployed in private cloud environments with enhanced controls.

# The Future of Online Tool Platforms

The trajectory of web-based tool platforms points toward increasingly sophisticated capabilities and improved user experiences. Artificial intelligence and machine learning integration will enable more intelligent tools that anticipate user needs, provide contextual suggestions, and automate repetitive tasks.

Natural language interfaces may allow users to describe tasks in plain language rather than navigating through menus and options. For example, a user might type ""convert this image to 800 pixels wide and reduce file size by 50%"" and receive the desired result instantly.

Enhanced collaboration features will enable multiple users to work simultaneously on projects, seeing real-time updates and communicating through integrated messaging systems. This evolution will blur the lines between standalone tools and comprehensive productivity suites.

Offline capabilities will expand, allowing users to download tool subsets for use without internet connectivity. These progressive web applications will synchronize data when connections restore, providing the best of both worlds—the convenience of web-based tools with the reliability of desktop applications.

Customization options will grow, enabling users to configure workflows, create personal dashboards, and build automated processes that chain multiple tools together. Power users will effectively program custom utilities without traditional coding knowledge.

# Comparing SwiftToolsKit with Alternatives

The online tools landscape includes numerous platforms, each with distinct characteristics and target audiences. Some platforms focus on specific niches—developer tools, image editing, or file conversion—while others aim for comprehensive coverage like SwiftToolsKit.

Specialized platforms often provide deeper functionality in their focus areas, with advanced features that power users demand. However, this specialization comes at the cost of versatility; users must maintain accounts across multiple platforms and learn different interfaces for different tasks.

Comprehensive platforms like SwiftToolsKit trade some depth in specific areas for breadth of coverage. This approach serves users who need occasional access to various tools rather than daily use of highly specialized utilities. The unified interface reduces cognitive load and the single-account approach simplifies access management.

Price models vary significantly across platforms. Some offer completely free access supported by advertising, others use freemium models with basic tools available at no cost and premium features behind paywalls, while some require subscriptions for any access. Users should evaluate their needs and usage patterns to determine which pricing model offers the best value.

# Best Practices for Using Online Tool Platforms

To maximize benefit from platforms like SwiftToolsKit, users should adopt several best practices. First, bookmark frequently used tools or create a personal dashboard if the platform offers customization. This organization saves time by eliminating repetitive navigation and search.

Understand the privacy implications of the tools you use. Review privacy policies and data retention practices, particularly when processing sensitive information. For critical or confidential data, consider whether web-based processing is appropriate or if local software would be more suitable.

Keep sensitive files encrypted before uploading them for processing when possible. Many tools can work with password-protected archives or encrypted files, adding an extra layer of security during transmission and processing.

Regularly clear browser cache and cookies to remove any locally stored data from tool usage. While platforms typically delete server-side data quickly, local storage in browsers can retain information longer.

Provide feedback to platform developers about bugs, missing features, or confusing interfaces. User feedback drives improvement and helps platforms evolve to better serve their communities.

# Conclusion

SwiftToolsKit represents the modern approach to productivity tools—accessible, comprehensive, and user-friendly. By consolidating diverse utilities into a single web-based platform, it addresses the fragmentation that has long characterized the digital tools landscape.

It feels like someone is watching what you do.

When Gmail does not filter things out your transaction history gets filled up with a lot of purchases that do not really matter which is just noise.

Automated spending tracking is supposed to help you. It is not helping when it shows you things like buying a coffee or a snack.

These are micro-transactions, like buying a coffee or a snack and automated spending tracking is including them in your history.

You probably do not want to see these micro-transactions like buying a coffee or a snack in your transaction history because they’re not important.

Automated spending tracking should not be showing you these things it should be filtering them out so you can see what is really going on with your money. People do not like automated spending tracking, like the kind Gmail does because it feels like it is invading their privacy. Automated spending tracking is too much for people to handle. They think it is not an idea because automated spending tracking is invasive.

The Solution: A Privacy-First “Control Console”

Customizable Spend Filters ($150 - $850):

Give users a slider to set their “Action Limit.”

Under $150: Total silence. No logs, no noise.

$300 - $750 (The Comfort Zone): Automatic logging of merchant and price via NFC only (No Gmail scanning).

When you buy things from The Security Zone and the total is over $751 The Security Zone will send you a message. This message from The Security Zone will tell you to scan the receipt that you got from The Security Zone when you made a purchase. You have to scan the receipt from The Security Zone so that The Security Zone can use it for the warranty and for tax purposes, at The Security Zone.

The “Manual Log” Button:

I believe it would be an idea to have a special button that allows people to keep track of the things they buy online. They can use the order number to do this. People can also use this button to keep track of the things they buy with cash. This way people are in charge of the information about their purchases and the things they buy with cash. It is easier than searching through their emails to find this information. The person who is using this button can choose what they want to keep track of. That makes them feel safe about their information and the things they buy online and, with cash.

Data Integrity vs. Personalization:

People can change the names of their transactions to things like “Dinner with Mom” at any time they want. They can do this with their transactions like “Dinner, with Mom” whenever it is convenient for them to do so.

When you make Price Edits you have to scan a receipt or verify an order. This is really important because Price Edits need to be accurate. The financial record has to be correct.

Price Edits are done this way so that the history of Price Edits remains valid. You see Price Edits have to be accurate so that everything adds up correctly in the end. This is why scanning a receipt or verifying an order is necessary when you make Price Edits.

Optional Security:

The app needs to have a setting that allows users to decide if they want to use Biometric locks or PIN locks to keep their app history private. Some people want to get into the app quickly.

They can just use the app without locks.

Others want to keep their app history private.

These people can turn on the Biometric locks or the PIN locks.

This way the Biometric locks or the PIN locks will keep their app history private.

People who do not care about their app history can just use the app without the Biometric locks or the PIN locks.

The app history will not be private, for these people.

People who want to keep their app history private can use the Biometric locks or the PIN locks to keep it that way. This makes the app good for everyone. The app is good for people who want speed. It is also good for people who want privacy for their app history. The app has something for people who want speed. The app has something, for people who want privacy.

Why this works: It reduces “notification fatigue,” respects global privacy laws by removing mandatory email scanning, and turns the app into a valuable tool for warranty management.

Hope your new year is off to a good start. I’m not sure how to provide context to this post but I will try. 

Like many of you, I have hopes, dreams, and ambitions, things that I wish to experience and accomplish in my life. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I just can’t get myself to sit down and do the work that would make me feel whole, whether that’s something as simple as cleaning up my living space, or more involved things like working out or going to a coffee shop to do some writing. I always thought that maybe I’m just lazy, or undisciplined, and that may be the case, but I still want change or answers. I feel like I’m on a path of solving this but I’m not really seeing results. 

There are parts of my life that I would consider semi “successful” in. I have a wife. A house. I’ve been fortunate enough to have a career as a television show editor/creative lead. I’m not completely hopeless lol, but in other areas I just tend to…no stick to or can’t get off the ground. When I have free time to do these things, I find myself gravitating to “relaxing” things, video games, social media videos, food….things I feel like I shouldn’t but I almost feel out of control of. Maybe it’s an addiction. But it’s still weird to me that I can’t do what i WANT if I can sit here and do all these things. 

I do have some mental health issues, and I’m thinking I have ADHD. I’m getting a mental evaluation soon to see if there’s anything further I can do to help this. It is hard to really explain this.

He is acting totally fine. Affectionate but still super energetic and playful. He’s eating, drinking, using the litter box, and responding to treats. Not lethargic. 

Any ideas? ",1,1767764527.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False
1q6769e,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1q6769e/repeated_lease_violations_request_to_leave_lease/,"Repeated lease violations, request to leave lease and lock changes. What comes next?","Location: Columbia, MO

I was living with a roommate. Agreement upon moving in was that our significant others (my fiance, her husband) would visit a few times a year. Others would be discussed beforehand. We are both in a doctorate program with intense hours, nightshift, etc. and were under the understanding that the apartment would be a quiet and comfortable living space. Upon moving in together, her dog was to be with her husband and would come for visits when he did. We discussed other things like cleanliness and had agreed not to let the kitchen and living room have dirty dishes left out and we would keep things tidy. Bathrooms aren’t shared so that was never an issue.

A few weeks into living together, we began having issues with cleanliness. Pots and pans were left dirty in the sink for days on end, countertop surfaces were soiled with crumbs and old food/sauces. I would clean them, she would get upset, I would ask for her to be a bit more tidy & the cycle would repeat. Until the time I moved out, we had multiple issues with her cleanliness. There were old salads left in our cardboard recycling, cups or protein powder left in her cupboards with ants in it, socks and dirty pee pads left on our kitchen table, garbage placed on counters instead of taking out & replacing bag, etc.. we had also had some issues with laundry as she would run 3-4 loads in a row from 6am-3am for sometimes days on end and I would have to ask if I could also wash my things, lol.

Then, her dog moved in. He barks all day long, is not good with strangers so he would urinate all over the apartment when he would see me, eats everything he isn’t supposed to (I wasn’t told this until after he ate a blanket of mine). She would keep him kennelled in her room while at school and I offered to help out once he got more comfortable, to allow him to get some more time out of the kennel but unfortunately, given his barking, this was not feasible. At this time, he is the only pet on our lease & visitors are strictly not allowed to have pets on our property under any circumstances. In May, I discussed getting a dog with her and she was excited, agreed to make sure we properly introduced them if it happened and was very much in favour of the idea. I then got approval from our leasing office to apply for pups.

Flash forward to June. After months of cheating on her husband, he decides to divorce her. She is hysterical for 2 days then decides to start dating (cool, no worries) but is constantly relying on me to watch her dog for her while she is out all night, not coming home until 7am and then gone again until the next morning. Again, her dog is not well trained, will eat my bedding, bark all night and urinate and defecate in the house when she is not there. He’s an anxious mess without her. About 5 days into dating someone, she brings him & his dog to our apartment without permission. She was giving him a key to our place and he was there overnight without her while she was on duty at school without my knowledge and I had never met this man face to face. I tried to let it go but it made me extremely uncomfortable as I was basically living with a strange man who could come and go when he pleased without my knowledge but it really hit a nerve on July 4th when she wrote me and said “we took the dogs for a big hike today. I think mine has heatstroke. Can you keep an eye to them (the dogs) while we go golfing?” And she left. I was going to the Ozarks but did take him out and watch him before I left. During this episode of pet sitting, he attacked her boyfriend’s dog twice. Jumped up and latched clean onto his face over nothing (no food, treats or toys). I then vowed I wouldn’t do it again and told her it didn’t seem like they were getting along and we needed to set some ground rules because I wasn’t comfortable with the comings and going of her boyfriend and his dog.

That Tuesday, I got word that my application had been approved and I was adopting an older dog with some health issues and it was important for low stress in her life. Again, it was discussed with my roommate and I told her her boyfriend’s dog (who legally was not even allowed to be there) would have to stop visiting while mine settled in. She agreed and seemed very understanding. Then, we had a break in our schedules and did not see each other for 6 weeks so we had some space.

She returned home in September and immediately had her boyfriend’s dog at our place for 10 days straight. In this time period, her dog for a contagious GI bug and she allowed him to defecate all over our apartment, did not properly disinfect it and then lied about it, leading to my dog contracting the same pathogen. I again asked her to be more cognizant of my space and my dog’s space and reminded her that her bf’s dog was legally not permitted to visit. This continued to be an issue until October.

In October, she again wrote and said her boyfriend’s dog was coming for the weekend. I told her legally, this wasn’t allowed and I didn’t approve because my dog (who is on the lease I also pay for) needed her own space too. We exchanged a few heat texts, agreed to discuss things later because we both had an important exam coming up and that was it; things seemed fine. From Sunday to Thursday of that week, she would not look my direction or speak to me when I saw her. I tried to initiate typical conversation because to me, we are grown women who should be able to discuss something and move past it, but she would even have a casual jello with me. It is important to note that, at this point, my dog and her reactive aggressive dog has still not been properly introduced. On Thursday morning, I woke up and gave my dog her meds and my roommate & her pup were nowhere to be found. I hear the front door unlock and my dog, who usually runs to my room to hide when this happens, actually ran towards her and as I turned to pick her up so my roommate could freely let her own dog down, I hear her say “well ‘my dog’s name’, you’ve got a decision to make” and drops her dog directly on top of mine, leading to him barking and snapping at her and chasing her into our kitchen until I could finally grab her from the other side of the island. My dog does not have teeth to defend herself and she has a bad heart. Stress could quite literally kill hers and my roommate knows that, is a vet student and put her in that position.

After I had calmed down, I went to leave for the morning and looked at her and said, despite how she felt about me after whatever happened in the previous few days, she didn’t need to do that with the dogs. She began to raise her voice, tell me I was being unreasonable and that her boyfriend and his dog would be visiting our apartment whether I liked it or not. I verbally told her our lease agreement does not allow outside pets, told her our issues were bigger and separate from her boyfriend and dog and we left for the day. Texts from later in the week again stated that she would continue to have her boyfriend and dog over regardless of how I felt and what the lease agreement stated.

There are 2 sections in our lease that address outside pets and visitors, and the comfort of those on our lease. She violated those two sections and despite written and verbal discussion, showed no indication of following the agreement she made. I stayed with a friend while I had some time to think about what I wanted to do and to give us time to write our board exam. In that time frame, I got a request for Nov rent, which I paid. Later in that month, I got a text from her saying she noticed I had moved out and she hoped I wasn’t returning (I had taken obvious things like glasses from the kitchen, my fav coffee mug, shoes, etc.) and at this point, I decided to take the rest of my movable belongings (everything but my furniture) and find another apartment. I didn’t know if I would be able to get out of my lease at this point but was willing to pay for two places for mine and my dog’s peace of mind and safety.

In December, I get a text from her requesting rent. At this point in time, I told her I had no intentions to pay rent from here on out as she violated two sections of our lease (with screenshots of both sections) and I had to seek outside accommodations due to her violations. I then said if she wished to discuss things further to try to find a solution, I would be open to it but I would not be doing it through text or in our shared professional setting.

The next day, I get a request from the lease office to return my apartment key. Their office was closing in 30m and I was too far away to get there in time but I called and they assured me that after 3pm the next day would be fine. The next day, I wake up and get an email regarding a service request that my previous roommate had entered to have the locks changed with a second email stating the job had been completed.

\*Now\*, I know this all seems foolish but my question is, since she did not respond to my messages, changed the locks and technically seized my remaining property, can she still legally come for rent money? I’ve read online that they would be conflicting actions and therefore it’s unlikely she could but I’d like a bit more insight.

\*\*\*before anyone says this, I was prepared to pay the rent in full or pay the lease termination amount given I signed a contract but she did not communicate with me to give me either of those options\*\*\*",0,1767764525.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

I don't post much, but if I had to debunk some common myths about the corporate world, they would be these:

1 - Human Resources is there to protect the company, not you: Don't tell them your problems, don't tell them more than they need to know. If they can use something against you, they will.

2 - If you're good at your job, you'll only get more work. The person who consistently gets the job done won't be rewarded. If a machine works where it is, you don't move it; you keep it there until it breaks. Keep this in mind when you want to work more hours.

3 - The person who gets the job isn't necessarily the best candidate, but rather the one who made it to the interview. Look at the HR world; it's brutal. Hundreds of CVs are received, and many excellent candidates are immediately rejected simply because their CV doesn't meet the required format or because they don't contact the recruiter, and their CV gets lost among the thousands.

4 - Most CVs are rejected immediately. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) cause your CV to be rejected in 80% of cases. In fact, we get rewarded for quickly discarding CVs. Therefore, your CV must meet these two requirements to reach a human:

\- Be anti-ATS, meaning it has a readable format.

\- Grab attention; use the job's keywords.

5 - You'll spend most of your time justifying your work, in unnecessary meetings, and on coffee breaks.

To truly stand out in job applications, the smartest candidates do the following:

\- They choose 1-2 positions they like.

\- They study the keywords used in those positions.

\- They save job postings for the same position and note the keywords, language, and skills required for each (they tend to be very similar).

\- They use AI to generate or enhance their CV; I'll give you some examples at the end.

\- They go to LinkedIn and search for ""hiring X"" (where X is the name of the position you saved).

\- They search for job postings, not specific jobs.

\- When you see an employee who has shared a position (it's important to filter by the most recent), apply and contact them immediately.

\- Companies usually offer bonuses for referrals, so it's essentially free money for them.

\- Send a sample message to let the person know you've applied, and since there's money involved, they'll likely ensure your CV is properly submitted.

And that's how you'll be in the top 1% of candidates.

I hope this helps.

It seems like the USA is treating Europe as a piece of garbage, as if its opinion doesn't matter.

First, using Russia, a dictatorship, to threaten and blackmail European nations into submission by stopping aid to Ukraine is just a very cheap, filthy move, and should not be tolerated.

Second, wanting to invade Greenland as if EU nations don't have sovereignty over their lands should be a clear sign that this won't be the first move of the USA to try to steal European resources.

I think we shouldn't let these transgressions happen unpunished. We, the people, have buying power. We should utilize it until the USA doesn't think it can get away with its actions.



Here is a list of the most common American products and their alternatives, with Danish options prioritized:

Phones:  Apple iPhone -> Choose a Danish refurbished/reseller or a Fairphone (Dutch) / Samsung ( south Korea) , Shiftphone (German).

Computers & Laptops: Dell, HP, Apple MacBook 
-> Choose a refurbished model from a Danish shop or brands like Lenovo.

**Social Media:** Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter) -> Reduce usage or explore Mastodon.

**Fast Food & Coffee:** McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, Subway -> Support your local Danish bakery, café, or pølsevogn. Choose European chains like Joe & The Juice (Danish) or Baresso (Danish) over Starbucks.

Clothing & Shoes: Levi's, Nike, Ralph Lauren, The North Face -> Look for Danish brands like Ganni, NN.07 (denim), Samsøe Samsøe, ECCO (shoes), or Rains. Shop at retailers like Magasin or Zalando (EU-based).

Drinks: Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Budweiser
 -> Drink Danish sodas like Faxe Kondi, Tuborg Squash, or local craft beer from Mikkeller, To Øl, etc. Choose Carlsberg over Budweiser.

Streaming & Entertainment: Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max -> Subscribe to Danish services like DRTV, TV2 Play, or Viaplay. Use European services like ARTE or MUBI.

Software & Cloud: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, AWS -> Consider Danish hosting providers or European services like Nextcloud.

Everyday Goods & Groceries: Choose Danish supermarket brands (like Rema 1000, Coop, Irma) over American-branded items. Opt for Danish dairy (Arla), meats, and produce.

Payment Systems: Use Danish MobilePay or instant bank transfers over services like PayPal (American) where possible.

When all the ESP and 12v-5v PSU are plugged in the ESP wont boot. But works fine when using jumper cables. I think its something to do with the power ramp up on the 5v power supply.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, is there anything obvious with my design?

I recorded a short video explaining the issue Link Below.

1q66qhk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q66qhk,"It logs. It proves. That Makes It Auditable, Which Makes It Trustable, Which Makes It Governable.","And let me tell you, I now understand what it feels like to be hit by a freight train made entirely of philosophical manifestos, blockchain receipts, and the ghost of a man who decided to weaponize , hesitation,  before dying. This isn't hyperbole. Lev Goukassian, may his cryptographically sealed memory rest in eternal, multi-chain peace, literally built a framework that turns ""wait, should we?"" into enforceable law, complete with Bitcoin receipts and a fund named after him. It's like if your conscience got a law degree, learned to code, and then started suing people.

I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me rewind.

---

It started innocently enough. My boss, Karen (yes, really), forwarded me an email with the subject line: ""NEW COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK - URGENT - READ BY EOD."" The attachment was called ""Mandatory\_Framework\_for\_Auditable\_AI.md"" and it was 40 pages long. Forty. Pages. In Markdown format, which meant it was going to be dense, technical, and probably written by someone who thinks ""brevity"" is a type of Belgian beer.

I opened it during my lunch break, thinking I'd skim it like I skim terms of service agreements, you know, scroll fast, click ""I agree,"" hope nobody dies. But then I saw the first section title: , , ""Ternary Moral Logic: A Mandatory Framework for Auditable AI"", ,  followed immediately by a badge that said ""Memorial Fund: Lev Goukassian"" in purple.

A , memorial fund, . In a technical document. 

I should have closed the file right then. I should have eaten my sad desk salad and pretended I'd read it. But no. I kept going. And friends, that was the moment I entered what I can only describe as the , , Ethical Thunderdome, , .

---

The document started with a philosophical gut-punch: ""Human moral reasoning operates within gradients of ambiguity and emotional context, while traditional AI systems remain confined to binary evaluation.""

Okay, fair. AI is basically a very confident toddler that only knows ""yes"" or ""no"" and occasionally sets your kitchen on fire because you asked it to ""heat things up."" I was with them so far.

But then, THEN, they introduced the , , Sacred Zero, , .

Picture this: You're an AI. You're processing a request. Someone asks you to do something. In a normal system, you either do it (+1) or refuse (-1). Simple. Binary. The way God and George Boole intended.

But in TML? Oh no. Now there's a , third option, . Zero. The Sacred Pause. The Conscious Hesitation. The ""Hold up, let me think about this and also write a legally admissible essay about my feelings.""

The document literally said: , ""This zero-state does not paralyze; it reflects."", 

I laughed so hard I choked on a cherry tomato. An AI that , reflects, ? What's next, an AI that journals? An AI that goes to therapy? ""Sorry, I can't process your request right now, I'm working through some blockchain trauma.""

But it gets better. Or worse. Depending on whether you enjoy existential comedy.

---

See, the Sacred Zero isn't just a cute philosophical idea. It's , enforceable, . The framework demands that every time an AI hesitates, every single time it goes ""hmm, this seems sketchy"", it has to create something called a , , Moral Trace Log, , .

And these logs? They're not suggestions. They're cryptographically sealed, timestamped, and anchored to , four different blockchains, . Bitcoin. Ethereum. Polygon. OpenTimestamps. The AI equivalent of sending a registered letter to God, the IRS, the UN, and your mom, all at once.

The document cheerfully explained: , ""No memory = No action. The framework remembers, so justice can see."", 

I stared at my screen. This was insane. This was beautiful. This was like if Kafka wrote a technical specification while having a panic attack in a courthouse.

Every AI decision now leaves a permanent, tamper-proof receipt. You can't delete it. You can't edit it. If you try to alter even , one bit,  of the log, the blockchain tattles on you like a younger sibling who just discovered the concept of justice.

And the best part? If your AI makes a high-stakes decision , without,  logging it? That's not just a bug. That's a , , criminal offense, , . The document casually mentioned that executives could face up to , 20 years in prison,  under 18 U.S.C. § 1519 for tampering with records.

Twenty. Years.

For deleting a log file.

I had to put my phone down and just stare at the ceiling for a while. Somewhere, a compliance officer was having a panic attack they wouldn't understand until their next performance review.

---

But wait! There's more! (I started reading this in an infomercial voice around page 15.)

The Sacred Zero doesn't just create logs. It , consults things, . Specifically, it consults , , 26+ human rights documents, ,  and , , 20+ Earth protection treaties, ,  that every TML system is legally required to carry around like a incredibly anxious backpack.

So now your AI isn't just deciding whether to fulfill a request. It's cross-referencing your request against:
- The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- The Geneva Conventions
- The Paris Agreement
- The Convention on Biological Diversity
- The UN Convention Against Torture (yes, really)
- Something called the ""Indigenous FPIC Protocol"" which I assume stands for ""Free, Prior, and Informed Consent"" but honestly at this point could have been ""Fully Panicked Indigenous Councils""

The document explained this with the poetic line: , ""When these two corpora meet, context meets conscience."", 

I'm not making this up. This is real. Someone built a system where every time an AI processes a request, it's essentially asking itself: ""But what would the Universal Declaration of Human Rights think about this? What would the Earth think? What would the ghost of Lev Goukassian think?""

And if the answer is unclear? SACRED ZERO. Log everything. Call a human. Maybe call several humans. Possibly call a lawyer. Definitely call the blockchain.

---

Now let me tell you about , , The Goukassian Promise, , , which sounds like a Dan Brown novel but is actually three separate concepts glued together with cryptographic signatures and spite.

First, there's , , The Lantern, ,  (🏮), which is basically a public badge that says ""Hey, our AI can pause before doing something horrible!"" It's like a ""Baby on Board"" sticker for artificial intelligence. Cute, right?

Wrong.

Because the document immediately follows this with: , ""Break the promise, lose the lantern."", 

That's it. That's the threat. You lose your emoji. You don't get to display the lantern anymore. And apparently this is legally devastating because the lantern is tied to...

, , The Signature, ,  (✍R◯), which is Lev Goukassian's actual ORCID number, his academic researcher ID, , embedded into the framework itself, . 

Let me repeat that because it's absolutely bonkers: this man put his , literal identity signature,  into the code of an AI ethics framework, so that any company using it has to cryptographically prove they're using his , actual framework,  and not some knock-off version where they removed the annoying ""don't be evil"" parts.

It's genius. It's insane. It's like if open-source software licenses were written by a philosopher-king who just got really tired of people cutting corners.

And finally, there's , , The License, ,  (📜), which makes all of this legally binding. Not ""please follow these guidelines"" binding. Not ""it would be nice if"" binding. But ""we will throw you in prison and take 10% of your global revenue"" binding.

The document, with the casual confidence of someone who's already won the argument, states: , ""The License transforms the TML framework from a simple piece of open-source software into a legally defensible infrastructure for AI governance."", 

Translation: ""We turned ethics into a lawsuit, and the lawsuit is already written.""

---

Around page 23, I started to suspect that Lev Goukassian might have been a supervillain. Or a superhero. Or possibly both, like if Batman decided to fight crime using only bureaucracy and Merkle trees.

Because then I got to the section about , , Always Memory, , , and friends, this is where it gets , really,  weird.

Always Memory is exactly what it sounds like: the AI , never forgets, . Every decision, every hesitation, every Sacred Zero pause gets written to an immutable log that exists in multiple places simultaneously, anchored to blockchains, with cryptographic hashes, compliant with something called ""RFC 3161"" which I'm told is important but sounds like a droid from Star Wars.

The document proudly declared: , ""Always Memory is TML's enforcement backbone, no memory = no action."", 

But here's the kicker: the memory isn't just stored. It's stored with , witnesses, . Universities. NGOs. Regulators. Insurance companies. They all get copies. It's called the , , Hybrid Shield, , , which consists of:

1. , , Mathematical Shield, , : Fancy blockchain math that makes tampering impossible
2. , , Institutional Shield, , : Actual humans at actual organizations who can verify the logs

So now we've got AI systems that are constantly journaling their every thought, encrypting those journals, and then mailing copies to Harvard, Amnesty International, and whoever else wants to babysit a robot's conscience.

The performance specs were hilarious too. The document promised that Sacred Zero triggers would add ""≤2 ms user-visible overhead"" with ""99.9% uptime across redundant chains.""

Two milliseconds. That's how long it takes for an AI to have an existential crisis, consult 46 different international treaties, write a legally admissible memoir about its feelings, and anchor that memoir to four separate blockchains.

I can't find my car keys in under two , minutes, , but apparently AI can speedrun moral philosophy in the time it takes light to travel 600 kilometers.

---

By page 30, I'd descended into what I can only describe as ""compliance madness."" The document just kept , going, . 

There was a section on , , Earth Protection, ,  that explained how AI systems must now consider whether their decisions violate planetary boundaries or upset Indigenous communities. Every environmental decision triggers consultation with something called the ""Community Witness Layer,"" which is apparently a decentralized network of Indigenous groups and local communities who submit verified ecological observations.

The AI doesn't just have to pause for human rights violations anymore. It has to pause for , the planet, . 

, ""The planet has no voice in boardrooms, no lawyers in courts, no vote in parliaments, TML gave it all three. In code. Permanently. Enforceably."",  ,  Lev Goukassian

This man gave legal standing to Earth by teaching robots to feel guilty. I'm not sure if that's the most beautiful or most terrifying thing I've ever read.

And if the AI violates environmental thresholds? Automatic penalties. Thirty percent goes to ecosystem restoration. Smart contracts enforce it. You can't negotiate with a smart contract. You can't sweet-talk the blockchain. The code doesn't care about your quarterly earnings report.

---

Then there was the , , Memorial Fund, , , which is where I realized this entire framework is basically an extremely elaborate will.

Lev Goukassian created this before he died (the document is very clear about this being designed during his ""confrontation with terminal illness""). And he built into the framework a permanent financial institution that would continue funding AI ethics research, victim compensation, and whistleblower protection , forever, .

Commercial users have to contribute. It's mandatory. The money goes to:
- Independent auditors (15%)
- Victims of AI harm (30%)
- Whistleblowers (15%)
- Research and development (40%)

And just to make sure nobody forgets whose framework this is, it's called the , Memorial Fund for Ethical AI Research, . His name is permanently attached to every transaction.

It's the most extra way to ensure your legacy I've ever seen. Other people write memoirs. Lev Goukassian built a self-perpetuating financial institution that forces every AI company in the world to fund AI ethics or face criminal charges.

Alpha move. Absolutely legendary.

---

The final sections got progressively wilder. There were whistleblower rewards of , 15% of recovered penalties, . There were provisions for lifetime care for victims with permanent injuries. There were detailed specifications for how to handle Sacred Zero conflicts in autonomous vehicles traveling at highway speeds (spoiler: the car can keep driving, but it better log , why,  it did what it did).

There was even a section on , , ""threshold gaming"", , , the practice of companies secretly adjusting their Sacred Zero sensitivity to make it trigger less often, that was classified as , wire fraud,  with up to 20 years imprisonment per violation.

Twenty years. Per violation. For tweaking a config file.

I imagine some startup bro somewhere, three years from now, casually commenting out a line that says ""SACRED\_ZERO\_THRESHOLD = 0.75"" and changing it to ""SACRED\_ZERO\_THRESHOLD = 0.95"" to make their quarterly metrics look better. And then the FBI shows up.

""Sir, you're under arrest for 147 counts of wire fraud, RICO conspiracy, and crimes against blockchain.""

""But I just changed one number!""

""That one number had a legally binding conscience, and you lobotomized it. You're going to prison, and 30% of your company's assets are going to a smart contract named after a dead philosopher.""

Beautiful. Poetic. Absolutely unhinged.

---

By the time I finished the document, two hours had passed. My salad was warm. My coffee was cold. Karen had sent three follow-up emails asking if I'd read the framework yet.

I sat there, staring at the final page, which contained something called the , , Voluntary Succession Declaration, , . Apparently Lev Goukassian, knowing he was dying, wrote a literal succession plan for his AI ethics framework and had it , notarized and anchored to the blockchain, .

The man blockchain-notarized his will. For a software framework. That he made open-source. But also legally enforceable. With criminal penalties.

The succession plan assigns stewardship to a council of universities, NGOs, and environmental organizations. It explicitly states that , no successor may remove,  the core protections: Always Memory, Sacred Zero, and the Hybrid Shield. Those are permanent. Constitutional. Immutable as the blockchain they're written to.

, ""Always Memory before action, Sacred Zero before harm, Hybrid Shield before trust."", 

It's a commandment. It's a covenant. It's the Ten Commandments but for robots, and Moses is a guy named Lev who really, really wanted to make sure AI companies couldn't speedrun their way into crimes against humanity.

---

I closed the document. I looked at Karen's emails. The most recent one said: ""We need to implement this by Q2. Budget implications???""

Budget implications. She wanted budget implications.

I just wrote: ""Read the document. We need to talk. Bring legal. And possibly a philosopher. Maybe also someone who understands blockchain. And definitely someone who can explain why we're now legally required to care what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights thinks about our email sorting algorithm.""

Send.

---

Three days later, we had the meeting. Legal showed up. So did our CTO, our Head of Compliance, and inexplicably, Janet from HR, who I think just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

I presented my findings. I walked them through Sacred Zero. The Moral Trace Logs. The Hybrid Shield. The Memorial Fund. The criminal penalties. The fact that Lev Goukassian had essentially built a legal time bomb into his framework that would explode on anyone who tried to cut corners.

The CTO asked if we could ""just use the open-source code without all the compliance stuff.""

Legal immediately said ""absolutely not"" while simultaneously pulling up 18 U.S.C. § 1519 on their laptop. They started reading aloud: ""Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record with the intent to impede, ""

""Okay, okay,"" the CTO interrupted. ""We'll comply. What's it going to cost?""

I looked at my notes. ""Well, there's the Memorial Fund contribution, which is mandatory for commercial use. There's the cost of implementing the logging infrastructure with multi-chain anchoring. There's ongoing operational costs for the Hybrid Shield. Training for engineers on Sacred Zero protocols. Legal review of our AI systems to ensure they're carrying the correct human rights and environmental frameworks. Probably therapy for everyone involved.""

""Ballpark figure?""

I shrugged. ""Less than a GDPR violation. More than a pizza party.""

Legal nodded grimly. ""Much more than a pizza party.""

Janet from HR raised her hand. ""Quick question: does this mean our AI assistant needs to pause before scheduling meetings if the timing might conflict with Indigenous environmental protection protocols?""

We all stared at her.

""Because,"" she continued, ""I'm looking at this document section here about Community Witness Layers and FPIC protocols, and I'm just wondering if Outlook is legally required to check with local Indigenous groups before double-booking the conference room.""

There was a long silence.

Finally, Legal spoke: ""Let's... put a pin in that. But yes. Possibly. We'll need to consult with external counsel who specialize in AI-mediated calendar scheduling as it pertains to international indigenous rights law.""

Janet nodded, satisfied, as if this was a completely normal sentence that people say in meetings.

---

We ended up implementing TML. Not because we wanted to, but because Legal made it very clear that the alternative was ""catastrophic liability exposure"" and possibly ""becoming a cautionary tale in a future Congressional hearing.""

The first week was chaos. Our AI systems started throwing Sacred Zero triggers constantly. Turns out, when you teach a machine to consider the moral weight of its actions, it becomes , very concerned,  about everything.

Customer service chatbot asked to recommend a product? Sacred Zero. What if the product was made in a factory with poor labor conditions? What if shipping it increases carbon emissions? What if the customer is secretly a child and we're facilitating unauthorized purchases? Better pause. Better log. Better check all 46 treaty frameworks.

Email sorting algorithm asked to prioritize messages? Sacred Zero. What if we're accidentally burying a whistleblower complaint? What if we're privileging one demographic over another? What if this violates GDPR? Pause. Log. Consult.

The worst was our experimental autonomous vehicle project. We had a test car doing laps in a parking lot. On lap three, it stopped.

Just... stopped.

The engineers pulled the logs. Sacred Zero had triggered. The AI had detected that its route would take it past a drainage culvert that emptied into a creek that fed into a river covered by the Clean Water Act, and it wasn't certain whether the microplastic tire particles it was generating constituted a violation of Earth protection protocols.

The car had given itself an existential crisis about tire dust.

We had to hire a environmental lawyer to review our test track's compliance with international water treaties before the car would move again.

---

But here's the weird thing: after about a month, we started to get it.

The Sacred Zeros became less frequent as the AI learned which contexts actually required moral deliberation. The logging overhead was barely noticeable, that 2ms promise wasn't kidding. And having complete, immutable records of every AI decision? That actually made debugging easier. We always knew exactly what the system was thinking and why.

More importantly, we stopped being terrified of audits. Because we had nothing to hide. Everything was logged. Everything was anchored. If a regulator wanted to know why our AI made a particular decision six months ago, we could pull up the Moral Trace Log, show them the blockchain receipt, and prove that we'd followed every protocol.

It was like having a really anxious, overly honest coworker who documented everything and never lied. Annoying sometimes, but ultimately reliable.

We even started appreciating the philosophical depth. Our engineering team had actual debates about moral complexity. What , should,  trigger a Sacred Zero? How do we balance efficiency with ethical consideration? When is hesitation wisdom, and when is it just overthinking?

We'd accidentally become better at ethics because a dead man's framework forced us to care.

---

Six months in, we got our first whistleblower case. An engineer noticed that one of our partner companies was systematically suppressing Sacred Zero triggers to meet performance targets. Classic threshold gaming.

Under normal circumstances, reporting this would've been career suicide. But TML has those 15% whistleblower rewards and anti-retaliation protections built in. Plus, all the evidence was already on the blockchain. The engineer just had to point at it.

The partner company got hit with massive fines. Their executives faced criminal charges. Our engineer got a reward payment that covered their student loans and then some. And the blockchain receipts meant there was no ambiguity, no he-said-she-said, no plausible deniability.

The evidence was literally mathematics. You can't argue with a hash.

---

Last week, I got coffee with my friend Marcus who works at a competitor. He asked me how the ""weird ethics framework thing"" was going.

I told him it was fine. We'd adjusted. It was actually kind of nice having an AI system that double-checked its work against international law.

He laughed. ""Must be annoying though, all that overhead.""

""Two milliseconds,"" I said. ""That's the overhead. Two milliseconds per decision to verify we're not committing crimes against humanity.""

""Still,"" he said. ""Seems excessive. We just use GPT-4 with some custom prompts. Works fine.""

I nodded. ""Cool. What happens when something goes wrong?""

""Wrong how?""

""Like, wrong in a way that ends up in court. Or the news. Or both.""

He shrugged. ""We'd figure it out. We've got good lawyers.""

""But do you have logs?""

""We have server logs, sure.""

""Cryptographically sealed logs? Anchored to multiple blockchains? With complete moral reasoning traces? Timestamped and court-admissible under FRE 902?""

""Uh... no?""

""Cool. Good luck with that.""

He changed the subject.

---

I think about Lev Goukassian sometimes. I never met him. He died before TML became mainstream. But I feel like I know him through his framework. Through the ridiculous, beautiful, paranoid, brilliant architecture he built.

He was clearly someone who'd seen too many things go wrong. Who'd watched companies take shortcuts and people get hurt and the powerful escape consequences. And instead of just complaining about it, he sat down and , solved it, . With math. And blockchains. And a legal framework so thorough that it would outlive him.

The document said he designed it during his terminal illness, in a hospital room, contrasting ""the measured compassion of a doctor and the unthinking acceleration of machines.""

That's what Sacred Zero is, really. It's the doctor's pause. The moment before the diagnosis where they double-check, consider, make sure. It's compassion translated into code.

And Always Memory? That's the promise that someone will remember. That harm won't disappear. That evidence will survive.

It's weirdly comforting, knowing that somewhere in the blockchain, in mathematical permanence, is a record of every time our AI systems paused to consider whether they were doing the right thing.

, ""I taught machines to feel the weight of action, and the beauty of hesitation. I paused, and made the future pause with me."",  ,  Lev Goukassian

---

So yeah. I read a 40-page document about a mandatory framework for auditable AI. It was insane. It was brilliant. It was written by a dying man who wanted to make sure that long after he was gone, AI systems would still hesitate before causing harm.

And now our entire company follows it. Not because we're noble or ethical or whatever. But because the alternative is prison, bankruptcy, and having to explain to a judge why we thought we were smarter than the blockchain.

Sometimes I look at the TML badge on our website, the little lantern emoji (🏮) that says we're compliant. It's kind of cute. Like a merit badge for robots.

But it's also a promise. The Goukassian Promise. That we'll pause when truth is uncertain. That we'll refuse when harm is clear. That we'll proceed only where truth is.

And if we break that promise? We lose the lantern. We lose the license. We lose everything.

But more than that, and this is the part Lev Goukassian really nailed, the blockchain will remember. The logs will remain. The evidence will exist forever, sealed in mathematical amber, waiting for someone to ask the question: ""What did they know, and when did they know it?""

You can't delete a Sacred Zero. You can't edit the past. You can't pretend you never hesitated.

The hesitation itself becomes the proof.

And honestly? In a world where AI is making increasingly consequential decisions, that's exactly the kind of paranoid, over-engineered, legally bulletproof system we need.

Karen still doesn't fully understand it. Last week she asked if we could ""turn off the Earth protection stuff"" for our new supply chain optimization project.

I just sent her the section about 18 U.S.C. § 1519 and asked if she'd like to be the test case for whether ""I was just following orders"" is a valid defense against blockchain evidence.

She hasn't brought it up again.

The lantern stays on. The Sacred Zero keeps pausing. The blockchain keeps remembering.

And somewhere, I like to think, Lev Goukassian is smiling. Or at least, his ORCID number is cryptographically verifying that yes, this is exactly what he meant to build.

A framework where machines can hesitate.

Where hesitation leaves proof.

Where proof becomes justice.

Two milliseconds at a time.

Forever.

December rolls around and everything seemed to settle, so I planned a gift exchange. We haven’t had a formal one since COVID and since getting our grownup jobs. I got Jenny tickets to a ballet she’s had been wanting to see and a pair of Dr.Martens she’s been dying for. I figured she could use a nice start to 2026! Jenny bought me a pot with dirt in it. Oh and there was apparently a tulip bulb inside because I like tulips. She gave our other friend beats headphones and another friend a record player! 

I got roasted the entire night. Little jabs from the rest of the group. I felt like she didn’t even try, I didn’t feel like that was appropriate for someone who was close to her. On the drive home the pot tipped over and dirt got absolutely everywhere, so I tossed it on the cub and drove away. I was so frustrated. With all the jokes tossed my way I know she feels bad but I haven’t told her the plant is gone. I’m kinda nervous to tell her because she’s definitely not gonna believe it tipped over by accident. Truth is though, that was a stupid gift to give someone. Or am I just ungrateful?

1q66nd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q66nd0/looking_to_learn_but_have_questions/,"Looking to learn, but have questions.","Ive been wanting a good espresso setup for quite some time now, I researched things back in 2018 and realized most of the ""nice"" stuff that was popular was also insanely expensive. So I put the espresso thing in the background for the last 8 years.

  
Over the last month or so Ive been researching all of the newest espresso stuff, judging prices, weighing options, looking at all of the high-end stuff to see why they were so expensive.

  
Single dose grinders sounded cool until I learned about retention, ""good"" ones cost hundreds to thousands. Even if you have a $250 scale to weigh your beans prior to grinding. Whats the point if its not consistent? Plus you lose the convenience of a hopper.

Grinders that grind by weight seem like the obvious solution for convenience, but they are extremely expensive.

Scales...some scales are over $250. Why do you need a machine to grind by weight if you already own a $250 scale?

Non-coffee scales are cheap and can weigh milligrams.  


I have a Baratza Vitruoso thats probably 8 years old (for drip coffee). I can get a milligram scale on Amazon for under $20 that includes a calibration weight. Place it under my Virtuoso (which can be calibrated to grind finer) and grind manually until I hit 18g and then stop.

Right there I just saved thousands from buying a grind by weight grinder and coffee specific scale. 

The retention problem? Solved. Doesnt matter because Im weighing to the .001 whats coming out.

The expensive grind by weight grinder problem? Solved. By using a $17 amazon mg scale that fits inside my Virtuoso base, plus I can just leave beans in the hopper and not weigh them every single time.

  
IDK, it seems like this would work equally as well as going all high-end everything.

1q66mwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q66mwy/relationship_advice_before_committing_to_long/,relationship advice before committing to long term 26F & 27M,"my boyfriend M(27) and I (26)F are about to move to another state together and start really doing life. he is a tattoo artist, I am a muralist about to go into school again. he wants to follow me to school. he is the son of my fathers best friend. He has been taking every tattoo job he normally doesn't, the past few months, trying to save before we did a temporary long distance, to meet back together and move to another state (when I start school). I was showing my gma his work the other day and stumbled onto a tagged photo of a girl in basically tiny spandex shorts getting tattooed very high on her thigh. He told me he stopped accepting any chest, stomach, pelvic, etc areas when we started dating me prior. not in a mean way but I'm not necessarily threatened by her looks, but it feels shady because he always shares photos of tattoos he does throughout the day, or tells me in evening after we both are off work. and I never saw that tattoo. he was previously abused by his ex wife. he was like the ""stay at home wife"", while she would go off and cheat on him relentlessly etc. he also was very abused as a child. he white lies a bit and I called him out on it. its usually nothing too serious just weird technical things like did you ask for this or did you do this (house hold things or asking about menus, etc.). I heavily called him out on it finally when it was a very blatant gas lighting scenario and said he needed to come to terms and be honest with himself and fix it, but that I wasn't going anywhere and that I'm here to support- the week before we went long distance. he denied that he did but said he understood and would work on it. I did not know if he genuinely thought he asked for something and didn't realize he didn't or was just flat out telling me he did bc he didn't want to when he did not, while we were ordering at a restaurant.

a few weeks ago (currently long distance) he brought it up saying he is noticing how he does embellish or impulsively mini lies etc. sometimes. but it felt fishy like he was saying that because he felt I was pulling back or wanting more time off the phone to focus. like nervous about loosing me so making it known that he is working on that. but was honest and showed some real deeper introspection on that subject out of the blue. he is doing better than ever since I met him, mentally. positive and motivated and does all this research on the projects I want to do and are my life goals. more than me lol. and is basically there for literally everything and anything I need or want. we never really fight etc.

his sister used to be a best friend, and told me that he lies about little things etc a long time ago. which brought my attention to it in the first place. which I think she is partially influenced by the people who also abused him as a child. so I see that truth, obviously, but she also has some weird belief systems around him and problems, herself. hence ""used"" to be best friends. we all come from crazy family backgrounds. our fathers meeting in prison.

him and I don't really party or do anything but work and art and animals fam etc. wholesome stuff.

I feel like this lying stuff could be a defense mechanism/trauma response from being so physically abused and people please-y to avoid the abuse. Where he says something immediately to shift stuff off of him. But he prides himself and wants to be honest based on the only parental figure he really ever had. he used to tell me he is big on not lying until I started calling him out on it and now he doesn't say that anymore. but even brought that up in that one discussion about it. i try to pull tarot and pray and I also want to put in effort to get some practical advice and just try outside of my bubble.

my other passion and profession is group therapy, coaching, and trauma healing. but I'm young and its different when its your partner and your own life stability that's essential for helping others. I have blocks and blind spots in my own relationships. but you cannot help anyone until you help yourself and own family.

I have not brought up the tattoos photos I saw. the universe told me to keep it to myself for now. he just feels naive or immature in relationships or girl experience. I mean on our first dates I defiantly saw him checking out girls as\*es and I was like is this f\*n real right now? it was that obvious and then if a girl would talk to him ordering coffee he like would be nervous and stuff like an inexperienced teenage boy. he has thus stopped after I obviously flipped out a few times. but he has only been with a handful of women. so it makes sense. and It makes me think that the intention is probably more simple. Then there was one time at a tattoo art show he just kept talking to this one artists fiancé and bought a book from her of her partner (the artist) art and I told him I was leaving and left. I came back and he was still talking to her and then after he was talking to the guy and telling him how nice his girl was and how lucky he was. I told him I was done and wanted to leave and he snapped at me and said what is your problem as I was leaving out the front. that is the only time he has ever raised his voice at me. he also said the context was that that other artist was saying how lucky my bf was too. he kind of went quiet and shut down after that. and did not bring it up. I dropped him at my dads and fn left.

he likes to communicate and does not really yell or yell back etc. just talks and expresses himself with concern and love and care. I never have actually gotten any where near a (me level) fight with him, like I definatley am capable- just by how he communicates and hears and just will almost do anything to keep me and ""grow"" the relationship. I don't think he could handle those anger depths pointed at him. he tells me and really shows me, I feel, that I'm his world and life and purpose. but then that it gives me mom wound vibes when he starts talking like that.

I am also hyper sensitive and have always been right in relationships and just not listened and found out later. usually above my better judgement. but I don't want to throw a baby out with the bathwater because of everyone else thus far.

I also have not been perfect in this and it almost feels like the universe throwing tit for tat, I used to miss an ex badly and I gave him a hug the last time I saw him. but since quit the job we both worked at, and stopped going to the gym we'd run into each other only a handful of times. its defiantly better this way, just took time to heal.

I was NOT ready for a relationship when we started dating, but since its my fathers best friends son I was like ok I won't just hookup and dip because he liked me. and it slowly seemed like a good fit. and its been 9 months, and its the only time I have ever been in a relationship this long and especially been pretty okay and not miserable. just some doubts. I'm not being abused, he's nothing but supportive etc. gives me space to live. doesn't trip about long distance and me traveling.

there was just simply those few instances and then a friend (girl) he rejected before I met him that would occasionally talk to each other on snapchat. in very beginning I had to say I'm not cool with y'all talking and then that was it.

he tried unfriending all female accounts an his insta until instagram locked him out and he had to create anew one. his only posts are of me.

at the same time It was tit for tat, and I feel like my brain is blocking out. I deal with artists and dj's and etc. hitting on me, then at the very beginning I was trying to mentally and in my heart move on from an abusive ex. I set clear boundaries and always reject advances. and I was writing to someone recently about technical stuff but nothing beyond that. but I still get those stray feelings that come up or random small attractions towards others.  I would be pissed if he was doing that. but these days I do what I need to do and feel because as I said its been tit for tat and usually there's something equivalently done. and I just don't care to people please these days. or get into anxiety. or really go out of my way.

but its the fact I have to say anything at all that burns me. I figure that the man I was to be with would have his fn stuff together enough where I wouldn't have to say anything at all. and that's really my doubt. also me too. with how I feel and stray fleeting feelings towards others or even an ex in the beginning. I mean he doesn't watch porn or jack off or really any of that either which is a huge green flag.

it could really be me and myself being highly resistant and mistrustful towards the male population as a whole, also really any person unfortunately. from wasted time and countless betrayals, along with experience working with psyches in those professions.

I was never physically abused like he was, so it's a gray area to distinguish in the sense of intentions with the lying, is it healable, and will it create problems longterm? or with love and trust can he let down that wall? normally one thing or a few things and I'm out. am I expecting too much or my emotional standards too high?

I was also interested in one of the main podcasts covering the case, which had just finished a series of talks at public universities across the U.S. promoting one host’s work.

To learn more, I filed public records requests, something I have done many times before.

Some of those requests produced emails from the Clerk’s office showing communications with the podcast, including attempts to enter court early by offering coffee and donuts to courthouse staff, and instances where sealed exhibits were released without a formal records request. I also found publicly accessible group chats where the podcast discussed filing ethics complaints against Murdaugh’s attorneys, shared prewritten templates for followers to use, and even discussed publicly naming a private citizen who had filed a complaint.

That led me to look more closely at the public university events - whether schools were paying for them, whether attendees or questions were being pre-screened, and similar issues. That, in turn, led to emails showing that the podcast had sent these schools lists of people who would not be allowed at their events, alleging all those individuals were engaged in “campaigns of online harassment"" against them. I recognized some of the names, some had their own Murdaugh related podcast, others had written a critical review of their podcast online.

I had a silly pseudonymous Twitter account with fewer than 200 followers where I shared some of what I was finding. I questioned why these individuals were being labeled this way and whether criticism was being reframed as “harassment” in attempts to silence it.

I shared how I found messages on a publicly accessible group chat where someone introduced themselves as the person who reported the ""egg juror"" and that they seemed to be thanking ""lunashark and Mark Tinsley guiding me"". I was curious about what “guiding me” meant in the context of contacting the court.  


[one of the messages I found, on a group chat, where the person who reported the 'egg juror' appeared to be happy that what they did was \\""helping Becky!\\"" and thanking \\""lunashark and Mark Tinsley\\"" \(I believe she was referring to the Clerk of Court.\) ](https://preview.redd.it/1wmy10q5tubg1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62a2453d803cd6c3b55cda0ddcae3eee6dfcc7c)

  
I did not hack anything. I joined a chat group open to anyone and found messages that they wrote. I filed public records requests and received info from those. I then talked about these to my tiny social media following. Mandy and her husband \*really, really\* did not like this.

In the days that followed, her husband tried to “rally the attorneys” on his social media. At first they thought I lived in Michigan — I don’t (haven't even visited). With the help of one of Mandy’s so-called “troll hunters,” who worked in a district attorney’s office, they attempted to obtain info on my account from Twitter/X. After determining where I actually lived/worked, I received a nice letter in the mail.

They accused me of using a “false identity” to join their groups (I did not), stealing “proprietary content” (public records aren’t proprietary), and violating a “contract” that they updated \*after\* I joined. I was sharing only things they themselves had written, posted, or sent.   
  
Why were they so bothered by some random online account sharing \*public records\* about things they said and did? I was/am a 'nobody' just sharing information and my opinions, why did they need to try and stop me from doing that? (That is rhetorical). 

**TL;DR:** When someone builds a business around pushing a single narrative, they may feel threatened when even a very small account questions it. Sometimes the people who say they’re committed to bringing the truth into the sunlight are also the ones most eager to keep certain things in the shadows. Filing FOIA requests is not a crime, and sharing lawfully obtained public records is not illegal. And if you made it this far: no, nothing ever came of their threats (aside from some frustration).

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/EY44LSVSux): **December 8, 2025**

I love my husband. We have been together 9 years, married for 6 and have been through a lot together. He has never given me a single reason to think he would stray from our relationship physically or emotionally. He is an amazing father, and very equally shares the household load. We have our ups and downs like most people but generally we are solid and always come back to each other after a disagreement.

Now to the issue. He recently embarked on his Master’s degree. He is one of only 2 men in his cohort of approx. 80 people, and the only guy of our culture (we are in our home country, the course and university is just incredibly multicultured)

As such, he has made a lot of new female friends, most of whom don’t bother me at all. But there’s this one (30f I think) that I just don’t like his friendship with and I know I'm being unreasonable.

They text all the time, like multiple times a day - mind you he isnt secretive about this. He doesn't hide his phone or anything like that. I can see her name at the top of his screen. He also talks ABOUT her all the time. How nice she is, and all the cool things she's done. He also spends a LOT of time with her - they have just decided to collaborate on a research project together for a conference in 2026 and as such they will likely be spending even more time together.

Frankly I'm sick of hearing about how nice and amazing this other woman is. Shes also annoyed the hell out of him at times, blowing like hot and cold at him when she has perceived he has done something wrong (though its probably cultural differences that trigger this) - and he'll talk about this too. It's like watching someone discuss the beginnings of a relationship, the euphoria of dating someone new, plus all the baggage they come with as they work through it, which is a weird thing to watch your husband go through.

I don’t believe it’s anything more than I have described above. When I said I didn't think it was appropriate for him to be messaging her as frequently as he is (and if the shoe was on the other foot, does he really think he would be okay with me messaging a man as frequently) and he offered to let me read all their messages (which I didn't) So I really don’t think he's hiding anything. I obviously don’t want him to start being secretive about it so I've said I'll drop it. But I just feel annoyed and jealous like every time I see her name pop up on his phone.

I don’t even think he's physically attracted to her, we have a great sex life and this is not something I feel insecure about. I guess she's shiny and new and interesting and they have a lot in common, I think I'm insecure about not being interesting enough for him and maybe sometimes feel like he'd rather talk to her than me.

I'm not used to him having female friends (though he used to have many when he was younger) and I'm finding this new dynamic really difficult.

Any advice as to how I can just get over it and accept this new friendship as it is?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You’re already getting some “advice” here from some of the most chronically insecure people on the internet, so let’s take the other view for a second.

If he was trying to replace you emotionally or physically, or be inappropriate in any other way, he simply wouldn’t be so transparent about it.

It sounds like he’s trying to engage you because he’s excited about a new friendship and wants you to be ok with this.

This doesn’t mean you stop looking out for the warning signs, but it means you look at what’s really worrying you about this, and what you can do about it.

It sounds like what you’re worried about is that there’s greener grass out there for him to find.

Whenever this is your worry, the first solution is to water your own grass. Remind yourself of all the reasons you’re his choice. He hasn’t forgotten- don’t let yourself forget.

Be secure in what you bring.

> **OOP:** Thank you, this is the most reasonable advice here I think. ""Water your own grass"" is definitely what I needed to hear in this situation. And I agree, I don’t think he'd be so transparent if he was doing anything wrong!

**Commenter 2:** This is the advice to follow.

Even men can get excited for new friendships, especially if there hasn’t been a solid friendship with someone else in a long while. Or if life just gets in the way.

I’ve been in exactly this situation. There was absolutely 0 attraction, 0 interest of emotionally cheating. Didn’t hide it, I did talk about her here and there, not necessarily like your husband, but that ”today me and XX did this and that” or whatever. Normal sharing from a life when you are away a few hours every day.

My wife ended up feeling exactly like you. And me personally didn’t need new friends or anything, so it myself suggested to take a step back. But still, it was 100% innocent and no way in this lifetime that something would have crossed any boundaries at any point. It was purely a new friendship and nothing else, and with someone with same experiences as me. Which are quite unique which is why it became a friendship to start with.

Edit: If she feels entitled to his time, or his speed in regards to answering, and such. Then that’s something to nip in the bud. Could be that her view of him ain’t matching his view on her(friendship vs something else). But it could be other things too that isn’t cheating or part of that scenario. Red flag? Yes, possible. But more from a friendship point of view, that it shouldn’t continue.

> **OOP:** This is another part to it, neither of us really has many friends either. He had loads of friends growing up but he has his first child quite young and has subsequently grown apart from most of those friends. He also said that all his pre-existing friends ever ask him about is the kids and he's enjoying having people he can talk about other things with.
> 
> That's probably also part of my jealousy to be honest because I am also very much lacking in the friend department!

**Commenter 3:** You don’t think he is physically attracted to her because she is less than you? Is she in a relationship? Kids?

If he is offering you his phone, take it whenever you feel the need sporadically, you won’t feel like snooping cause he already gave you permission, hope that way eases your anxiety.

> **OOP:** I don’t think anyone is less than me or I am more than anyone but he is obsessed with me physically lol. As much as he was at the beginning of our relationship if not moreso since I had our kids to be honest

**Commenter 4:** It sounds to me like your fear is that she is becoming emotionally stimulating in a way you’re not. So the solution is not to restrict him from being her friend, it’s to reignite the spark in your marriage. You don’t need to go into competition with her but your feelings warrant a deeper discussion with him about your emotional experience and what will help you feel secure. In the end of the day, time spent with a friend (texting, phone calls, in-person) shouldn’t exceed time invested your the relationship.

If you’re not already doing this start dating again, sometimes we get stuck in our daily routines so initiate experiences together like trying a new restaurant, class, trip, hobby. Carve out intentional connection time where you’re not discussing logistics or children. Create rituals like weekly check-ins, Friday night wine and music at home or out, Sunday morning coffee walks together or with the kids. If he ever becomes resistant to this in favor of spending time with her or he’s constantly distracted by her during “your” time, then I’d start to worry.

It doesn’t sound like your marriage is threatened at this point especially if he’s being transparent as there’s still affection between you. But the relationship could benefit from infusing some fresh energy, since he’s getting a ton from school.

> **OOP:** This is really good advice thank you. We have tried to do a bit more ""dating"" in recent months as we both acknowledge how its easy to just sort of forget one another with how busy we both are and kids etc. Trying to make it more of a regular thing probably is in order though. We do have a going out date booked in in a couple of weeks (babysitter and everything lol) and we actually went out during the day a couple of weeks ago as well. So it is there but could definitely be more frequent. Thanks again!

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/JZmTLzIAPr): **December 31, 2025 (3.5 weeks later)**

**[UPDATE] How do I (31f) stop being so jealous regarding my husbands (34m) new friend?**

This is not going to be a long update and will probably not be that exciting/interesting but some people wanted an update from my last post.

My husband and I discussed his new friend a few times and he understood where I was coming from but was a bit hurt because he's never done anything in our relationship to suggest he might ever be unfaithful. I believed him when we talked about it but he thought it would be better if I could just meet her to try and understand a bit better and I agreed.

We had a few friends over for his birthday last night and she came. The birthday gift she got him was a picture of my whole family (me, hubs, and the kids and even the dog) that she'd made herself (digital - she's a bit of a graphic designer) on a light box. It's really beautiful and I think its a lovely present because it includes me and the kids. She was incredibly respectful all night, and we actually have a fair amount in common with some shared interests and shared experiences (e.g. we have both been scuba diving and are interested in marine conservation). She just seems genuinely very nice, not fake at all and her being around felt very akin to my husbands other female friend that we had over as well. All that to say, I'm no longer concerned about anything dodgy developing between her and my husband and I certainly don’t think anything untoward has happened as yet. Oh also, I caught a glimpse of their messages this morning and she was messaging him about how nice I seemed, and he was talking about how cool I am - that wasn't performative because he didn't tell me about it. It was just part of the conversation they were having. The rest of which was about the Japanese curry my husband made last night 🤷🏼‍♀️ idk I'm sure reddit will tell me im being stupid or naive but it just feels very innocent now I've actually met her.

Aside from this my husband and I have had other arguments about other issues in our relationship and have agreed on one at home date night per week where we do something fun together but also like get a bit dressed up and like make an effort for each other (instead of only making and effort when we go out or go to the office or whatever). We're also working on each of our individul mental health and wellbeing as well (eating better, exercising more, allowing each other ""me time"" away from the kids in a more consistent way). Some of the advice I got on my last post was about making more of an effort in our relationship and ""watering my own garden"" as well so I feel like we are addressing that.

I'm hopeful we can do this well and 2026 will be a better year for us. We love each other very much, and our family so we're going to improve our communication and work on ourselves and our relationship as best we can :).

Thanks for all the people who gave reasonable advice on my last post - there was more than I was expecting!

**Relevant Comments** 

**Downvoted Commenter:** I’m married. I don’t have female friends. She doesn’t do friendships with men. We have couple friends, she has female friends, I have male friends. OP, ask yourself- all things being equal, if your partner is mentally, physically, mentally, and socially healthy with male friendships, what value does being friends with a specific woman provide him? I would suggest that people in committed relationships that are completely healthy in their social and mental health don’t seek or maintain friendships with the opposite gender. We do so when there’s a romantic or social gap that we’re trying to fill. I suspect that your partner is having a need met by this person that is not fully healthy.

> **Commenter 1:** I really disagree with this. I am also in a serious relationship and have been for many years and we both have totally innocent friendships with people of the opposite sex. in fact, I personally find it a red flag when my partner can't sustain a normal friendship with a woman (I am female and he is male) as it suggests to me that he doesn’t see women as equals if he is unable to have non sexual/romantic relationships with them.
> 
> > **OOP:** I also disagree with the comment, I actually completely understand what my husband gets out of this particular friendship and its nothing to do with the fact she's a woman. 

**Commenter 2:** This is a good update and sounds like you both have great communication! I think it says a lot about her character that his present included you and your kids - she clearly respects his relationship with you and wanted to make that clear.

> **OOP:** That's how I took it as well :).

Our dog has lots of energy and is sometimes very social (begs for the park), so we like to set up play dates for our dog. We also know very few people here, so we'd love to make friends in general. We're down to hang out at either Optimist Dog Park or the other one by the university. As the park is often hit or miss as to whether or not anyone else is there, we're posting here to go out of our way to make new dog park friends and try to schedule things ahead of time. 

Other things we love to do besides go to the dog park include hiking, checking out coffee shops, and in the summer taking inflatable boats out on a lake. We moved here from somewhere with no snow so we'd also love to get into winter activities like sledding. Also we occasionally like day trips to other cool places nearby - state parks, hot springs, etc. If this sounds like stuff you'd also like, we're also down to hanging out outside of the dog park - again, as we know almost no one here, we'd love to make friends in general.

1q66d1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1q66d1e/the_manor_im_working_at/,The manor I’m working at,"So for the past week I have been doing this babysitting job at this manor in the English countryside for this noble opulent family. I look after three children: two boys and a girl. From my last post you can check out, I did encounter some strange eerie occurrences so this is more so an update. Long story short, i looked through my bedroom window and saw people with black hoods performing rituals in the garden at night and have had some odd interactions with the middle girl who told me she vividly saw black hooded monsters in her dreams which matched well with what I saw through the window. I was up all night terrified with what I saw. 

The next day, I was given permission to go to the local town nearby which I just ubered. The kids were at private school so I had free time. It’s a  nice peaceful historical town not really littered with tourists. While there, I went to this museum and looked around. What I discovered, was historical photos of the manor along with paintings, valuables like gems, necklaces, pearls, old clothes and shoes and whatnot. There was a woman looking down at the items beyond the glass and I decided to converse with her to know more about where I’m at. From then on, I guess we became friends. Later that day we had coffee and we got to know each other and I told her about how I work at the manor by the town. She was in disbelief and told me only certain people get to work there. The people at the manor seem to be very mysterious and cut off from the locals with how she described the family and the fact that some times huge rows of expensive black cars head straight to the manor. People just assume that they have special events but with how often that these cars come and literally fill the town, it’s certainly not some special rare occasion where some elite marriage or funeral is taking place. She told me her sister worked there as a baby sitter just like me and was found dead by a water fall just behind the manor. The cause of her death noted as unexplained. She believes that she was killed and by god did she convince me. The evidence and the police’s dismissal of it all is quite telling. We exchanged contacts and that’s that. 

The next day, I was looking after the kids before being approached by the husband of the mistress who we refer to as “master” of the household. He’s a tall strict looking old man with icy blue eyes. He told me in his guttural-like accent that a huge event is happening at 10 after the kids are put to bed and asked me to assist in preparing the table and making the guests feel comfortable. I accepted and joined the other maids there doing chores like cleaning the floors and putting down cutlery and napkins on the table etc. I couldn’t believe the immense number of tables covering the guest quarters. I really didn’t know what to expect. Fast forward to around 8ish, everything was prepared and I managed to tuck the kids in before listening to more begging from the eldest for another go at playing Bach on his piano. I walked downstairs to see the spindly master and strict upper lip of a mistress. They were strangely in a line together with their hands behind their back just behind the door with maids aligned in front of them on the other side of the door bowing their heads to the ground. Mistress gestured for me to join them and I awkwardly copied the other girls. She briefly explained about how this is a special family reunion.For a brief 5 minutes guests poured through the door and all I could hear was loud welcoming  and laughter. Men and women in fancy glitzy attire filling the what was an empty old manor. The dull miserable couple I had been working for were social butterflies. I peeked my head upwards and saw constant handshakes and curtsies and chatter from all over the place one talking about Oxford, the other about a new property in the Bahamas and the others going on about how comfortable their journey from their private jet was. I was overwhelmed and didn’t know what to make of it, I looked back on the other maids who weren’t interacting and kept their head down which I was definitely creeped out about. Easily over a hundred people were there. After everyone was there, I suppose we were granted freedom of movement so I went to the window and saw the sheer number of vehicles parked, literally filling the lawn and coating it with luxurious cars. 

My job was done from there but instead of retreating to my room I curiously watched the people take their seats leaning on the wall in standard curiosity. There was this young man though that instead of mixing with the others, approached me. He rolled his eyes sarcastically telling me how they are a bunch of bores and all they talk about is money. I laughed along and asked if that was not his forté. Basically, we got to know each other. With his thick English accent he said he’s my age (19) coincidentally and how he’s a heir to the family name. He was clearly flirting with me and I told him I’m tired and I’m going to my room which had some pleading from him but I ignored it. While in my room, all I could hear was the loud talking from downstairs but what pierced through all that noise was the faint sound of what I heard to be scraping off a wall and children crying. I hesitantly checked all the kids rooms and they seemed to be fast asleep so it wasn’t that. 

Anyways, I went back to my room, scrolling through my phone in boredom until all that chatter seemed to fade. Everyone had retreated to the garden which I took as just a regular outing. You can say I’m lying and it does sound absurd but they all went into a circle. Again I went back to watching my phone thinking it was a game or something. After afew minutes, I look back to see that same guy I was talking to in the centre of the circle in a crawling position naked. I couldn’t make out too much but I noticed that they were all splashing what looked like wine on him before bowing their heads up and down for atleast a couple minutes. Here, I was in complete shock. My heart beating out of its chest. There was a black cloaked individual who walked into the circle with what looked like a large staff with fire on the end. I witnessed them plunge it into his back. I couldn’t look at any more of it and started frantically texting my mother about what’s going on. In summary, she told me to get my ass outta there. Well what could I do? Run? Eventually the ordeal was over and the guests left. I’m on my last day now and rest be sured I’m taking that cheque and leaving. ",0,1767761997.0,Paranormal,2,0.5,False

I make myself at least eat a banana before the coffee. But as the day goes on I can feel it. I think maybe I don't eat enough for breakfast and lunch so the coffee hurts me.

I'm also stressed right now so that doesn't help me. I have allergies and other issues that my nasal passages and lungs are dry. All these things make my voice dry and tired and hoarse. I get sad because I talk a lot and am a singer so these things become difficult and it makes me sad. I also don't want to develop cancer.

- queue together

Next to him, a young man in butler uniform furrowed his brows—clearly displeased by the sight. His silver glasses gleamed under the pale light. Once the man finished, a hum of pleasure escaped his bloodstained lips—licking away the crimson remains. He met the butler's gaze, smiling as he handed the kettle to the other.

The screen blinked to a different setting, this time it was a thick forest under a pitch-black sky. The camera was set to infrared due to the lack of lighting. There were bulking tree roots and leaves covering the dirt, a large flower budding next to the roots. Two figures slid into the camera, a European man from the video earlier—now wearing a practical gear of shirts, cargo pants, and combat boots. His long, blond hair tied in a ponytail. The other figure was a shorter, European man—his hair more curly and copper, tied with a ribbon. A diagonal scar slashed across his left eye and brow. He wore a linen shirt, cravat, and a vest paired with form-fitting pants and knee-high buttoned boots. A sheathed rapier hanged from his belt, ready to be unleashed. The taller man took photos of the flower with expensive-looking camera. He moved to several points as if making sure he catched every single angles.

Prince: You know, Arnold. This flower, it reminds me of you.

Arnold: \*raising a brow, hand pressed on the hilt of his rapier\* Oh really? How so?

\[In a flash, the Prince moved—followed by a loud clash of steel meeting steel. He raised a kris against Arnold, who had deflected it with a blade of his rapier. Arnold's eye was wide open, more at audacity rather than surprise. He pushed forward but was met with the Prince's offending strikes, parrying it each time. Their movements were hard to catch up, the use of Celerity reduced to arms to nothing but blurred rapid motions. The Prince moved with grace, his footwork remained consistent yet the underlying fury made each clash of his kris seemed barbaric. Meanwhile, Arnold tried to keep it cool—each moves were controlled with his limbs itching for a kick or a punch or any other foul attack that would give him the full advantage to catch the Prince off-guard and re-create their brutal first encounter. After a few minutes, they stay locked in blade against blade. The Prince's expression was full of anger, frowning deeply and bared his fangs.\]

Prince: Where do I even begin? You murdered my colleagues, left scars on my back, separated me from my family but most of all...

You dragged me into this world..!

Arnold: That has nothing to do with the flower.

Prince: Shut up and let me finish!

\[They jumped back on opposite directions. The Prince sliced his wrist—letting vitae dripped onto a tree root. Suddenly, the roots started twisting and turning in unnatural way until it became a towering monstrosity.\]

Prince: You left me in this god-forsaken place for five decades, with no servants, no wealth, no allies. Nothing. Since then, I made a pact with various beings roaming these lands. I've built villages, businesses, communities—all without your help.

\[Before Arnold was able to reply, a tree root lunged at him. He evaded in time until dozens of roots launched themselves from many directions. Arnold waltzed back, suspending the attack with shadow hands.\]

Arnold: I know you can, I wouldn't leave you here if I wasn't confident in your abilities.

Prince: Tell me, Arnold, was I a mistake? That I brought shame to you from an action that was entirely a product of your unchecked, twisted pleasure? Now that you have a proper childer, whom you sent here as well, you think you can just shower him in affection and steal away my dear Seneschal?

Arnold: No, of course not. You aren't a mistake. I was fully aware of the consequences when siring a childe. My reputation wasn't the best, hence why I want you to make a name for yourself. As for Joshua, while our minds align, I see him as an overgrown teenage spawn at best. He can make his own decisions and his decision is to stay with you.

\[Another clash of steel rang through the air, the Prince made the first move again—their blades met, followed by a flurry of attack and parry. Arnold slowly pushed the Prince back with his powerful swings and impeccable footwork, leading him to a tree where the rafflesia arnoldi rested. After one last parry, Arnold pinned the Prince to the ground—causing him to growl and thrash like caged animal. Their blades were left on the ground, a few meters away from their current positions. More than five minutes passed of Arnold holding down the Prince's wrists until he calmed down. His feral expression now returned to a more neutral—almost resigned expression.\]

Prince: I know you brought a lighter with you. Why didn't you used it?

Arnold: If you mean setting this place on fire, that would've put us in danger.

Prince: But you have mastery of Celerity, you can escape easily.

Arnold: Then it would've rendered the whole point of this journey meaningless. I'm not here to covet your subjects. I'm here to mend our rather...complicated bond.

Prince: \*chuckling playfully\* I never knew you could be so sweet, sire. Perhaps I'll allow you to do anything you want before we leave.

Arnold: I'm not interested. Ask Joshua next time. Besides...

\[They looked to the side, where a budding rafflesia arnoldi was unscathed from their little scuffle. Arnold got up, releasing his hold on the Prince and helped him up—sweeping off the dirt and leaves from their bodies.\]

I don't think a corpse flower would make a good aromatic to set the mood.

Prince: Speaking of corpse flower, it reminds me of you because we are all parasites but you...are a unique kind. There are only a handful like you around, our existences may not be fully beneficial to the world but we exist anyway.

\[After saying such cryptic words, the Prince leaned down to seemingly leave a peck on Arnold's cheek. The sudden display of affection caught Arnold off-guard, looking at the Prince as if he was possessed. They walked away until the camera wasn't able to capture them. The video ended in a blip.\]

I recently built a cafe in Chennai from the ground up. Not from a franchise, not with a big investor, just straight-up learning everything the hard way, location hunting, interiors, staff, suppliers, licenses, customers, all of it.

I thought I’d share a few real things I wish someone had told me before I started.

1. Rent will eat your soul

The number of places that look good on Instagram but make zero business sense is insane. Everyone wants premium rent, zero responsibility and advance like you’re opening a mall.

2. Staff is the hardest part, not coffee

Coffee recipes are easy. Consistency, attendance, attitude, language barriers, training from scratch, that’s the real job. No YouTube video prepares you for this.

3. Chennai customers are loyal but unforgiving

If they like you, they’ll come back again and again.
If you mess up once, they’ll remember forever.
Service > aesthetics. Always.

4. Instagram hype ≠ daily revenue

Launch days are fun. Reels get views. But weekday afternoons will humble you very fast. You survive on regulars, not influencers.

5. Licenses & “adjustments” are real

If you know, you know. If you don’t, you’ll learn quickly.

Despite all this, I don’t regret it. Building a space where people come to work, talk, sit alone, create or just exist, that part hits different.

Not here to promote anything. Just sharing in case someone else is thinking about doing something similar in Chennai.

Happy to answer genuine questions about costs, mistakes, timelines or just vent together.

My weight has gone from 260.1 to 226.9

I put on a 2x shirt after a while of deciding whether or not i wanted to.  I wanted to wait a while because I thought it'd still be tight.  However, when I put the 2x on... it is quite roomy.  I could probably put on an XL and make it work, but i like clothes feeling a tad looser.  

Zero cravings for anything I used to eat.  I've been surrounded by foods i would have loved in the past and have zero interest in them.  When I think about those foods, I remember how i felt when eating them regularly.  

I do drink coffee every morning, just black.  I do not seem to have any issues with it, so I'm going to keep drinking it.

I gave up soda 45 days in, and I will NEVER look back.  Eliminating soda has been an absolutely perfect thing for me.  I didn't realize how even though i felt great, soda was slowing me down.

When I eat ground beef, I feel the best.  I've eaten chicken a time or 2 and while I still feel great, i just don't feel quite as good, so I mainly stick to eating beef.  I don't eat steak a lot simply because of the cost. I generally eat some sort of mixture of either burgers or tacos.  I don't use taco pouches from the store because they are loaded with stuff, I use pollo rojo taco seasoning, which is just seasonings.  No additives.  Feel great eating it!

I stay away from most processed things even if i can eat them.  I did keto years ago and ate pepperoni every single day.  I've eaten it so little during this journey.  It's not that I don't think I can eat it, I just don't.

Food isn't something I look at as a ""fun thing"" anymore.  Now i'm not saying I don't have a good time going out and eating occasionally.  What I mean is, no matter what the situation is where eating is involved I try to make the best decision for myself to fuel my body and make sure I'm functioning at the highest level.  When I do go out I do not ask them if they use seed oils.  perhaps I should, but I eat out so little i'm just not concerned about it right now and I've so far had no adverse effects that I can tell.

1q664uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverMadeEasy/comments/1q664uk/the_shocking_cost_of_medical_emergencies_abroad/,The Shocking Cost of Medical Emergencies Abroad,"A single night in a US intensive care unit averages $5,000. A heart attack? Try $25,000. An ICU stay after a stroke? You're looking at $150,000 or more.

Now imagine facing these bills in a country where you don't speak the language, don't have insurance, and your credit card is already maxed from booking flights. The math stops being theoretical real fast.

Nearly one in four Americans experiences a health problem while traveling internationally, according to research by Harris Poll and GeoBlue. Most of them never thought it would happen to them. And the ones without proper travel insurance? They're the ones dealing with bills that can wipe out savings faster than you can say ""emergency room.""

Let's talk about what medical emergencies actually cost abroad—and why the $50 you're trying to save by skipping insurance could turn into a $50,000 nightmare.

# The Real Cost of Medical Emergencies by Country

Healthcare costs vary wildly depending on where you land. What costs $200 in Spain could cost $20,000 in the US. Here's what you're actually looking at if something goes wrong.

# The Most Expensive Countries for Medical Care

After reviewing insurance claim data from multiple providers, these destinations consistently rack up the highest bills:

|Country|Emergency Room Visit|One Night Hospital Stay|Major Surgery|Medical Evacuation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|United States|$2,200+|$5,000+|$25,000-$150,000+|$20,000-$200,000|
|Switzerland|$1,500-$2,000|$3,000-$4,000|$20,000-$100,000+|$15,000-$150,000|
|Canada|$800-$1,200|$2,000-$3,000|$10,000-$50,000|$15,000-$100,000|
|Australia|$500-$800|$1,500-$2,500|$8,000-$40,000|$100,000-$250,000+|
|Japan|$300-$600|$1,200-$2,000|$7,000-$30,000|$20,000-$100,000|

The US leads the pack, spending $12,742 per person on healthcare—more than any other developed nation. A fractured arm in San Francisco recently cost one traveler £153,000 ($200,000+). Not a typo. A broken arm.

# The Surprisingly Affordable (But Still Not Free) Options

Europe tends to be gentler on your wallet, though you'll still pay:

|Country|Emergency Care|Hospital Stay|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Spain|$50-$200|$1,100-$1,500/night|Public hospitals often cheaper|
|France|€50-€200|€800-€1,500/night|May bill you later at home|
|Greece|Free-€200|€500-€1,200/night|Emergency care often free|
|Thailand|$100-$500|$500-$1,500/night|Can spike to $15,000+ if infected|
|Mexico|$100-$400|$800-$2,000/night|Often requires upfront payment|

💡 **Pro Tip**: ""Affordable"" doesn't mean free. Even a €200 emergency room visit in France can turn into thousands if you need surgery, extended hospitalization, or medical evacuation back home.

# The Real Horror Stories

Let me share what I've seen happen to real travelers:

* **$170,000 air ambulance**: A woman adopting a child in Uganda got into a severe accident. She needed immediate evacuation to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. The bill? $170,000. Without insurance or that kind of cash on hand, her church community had to fundraise.
* **$12,000 infection**: Two travelers were visiting family in California when one developed a cheek infection. What started as a routine doctor visit ($350) turned into a two-night hospital stay. Final bill: over $12,000.
* **£200,000 brain hemorrhage**: A British traveler suffered a brain hemorrhage in China. Treatment and repatriation cost £200,000—more than most people's homes.
* **$13,000 heart surgery**: A couple hiking in Switzerland faced a sudden heart problem requiring three stents. The hospital demanded payment guarantee before treatment. Two days in the hospital: $13,000.

These aren't worst-case scenarios dreamed up by insurance salespeople. These are actual claims filed by actual travelers who thought ""it won't happen to me.""

✅ **Quick Answer**: Medical emergencies abroad can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to over $200,000. The US, Switzerland, and Canada are the most expensive. Even ""affordable"" countries like Thailand or Spain can hit you with five-figure bills if complications arise or you need evacuation.

# Why Your Regular Insurance Won't Save You

Here's what trips up most travelers: they assume their regular health insurance covers them abroad. Spoiler—it probably doesn't.

# Medicare Doesn't Cover International Travel

If you're on Medicare, you're paying out of pocket for everything outside the US. Medicare explicitly states it doesn't cover medical costs outside the United States, with extremely rare exceptions (like if you're traveling through Canada and a Canadian hospital is closer than a US one during an emergency).

Your Medicare coverage ends at the border. Period.

# US Health Insurance Has Limited or Zero Coverage Abroad

I can't count how many travelers I've met who assumed their Blue Cross or Aetna would cover them in Bali or Barcelona. Most US health insurance plans either:

* Offer zero coverage outside the US
* Cover only ""emergency"" care (and good luck arguing what counts as an emergency)
* Reimburse you later (meaning you pay upfront, possibly thousands)
* Have massive deductibles that make coverage essentially useless

Even if your plan technically covers international emergencies, you're still facing:

* **Upfront payment requirements**: Many foreign hospitals demand cash or credit card guarantees before treating you
* **Reimbursement delays**: Filing international claims can take months
* **No evacuation coverage**: Your plan won't pay to airlift you to better care or home
* **Network limitations**: Out-of-network rates abroad can be astronomical

# Credit Card ""Travel Insurance"" Isn't Enough

Your credit card might offer travel insurance if you booked flights with it. Sounds great until you read the fine print.

Most credit card coverage includes:

* Trip cancellation/interruption (useful)
* Lost luggage (somewhat useful)
* Travel delays (occasionally useful)

What they typically DON'T include:

* Comprehensive medical coverage
* Medical evacuation (the expensive stuff)
* Pre-existing condition coverage
* Adventure sports injuries

Chase Sapphire offers decent trip cancellation benefits, but medical coverage? That's where you need actual travel medical insurance. Credit card coverage is a nice bonus, not a replacement.

⚠️ **Important**: Assuming your regular insurance or credit card has you covered is one of the most common—and most expensive—mistakes travelers make. Always verify your actual coverage before you leave.

# The Hidden Costs Beyond Hospital Bills

The hospital bill is just the beginning. What really drains bank accounts are the logistical nightmares that come with serious medical emergencies abroad.

# Medical Evacuation: The Silent Budget Killer

Medical evacuation costs $20,000 to $200,000 depending on where you are and where you need to go. That's not for treatment—that's just for transport.

Examples of evacuation costs:

* **Thailand to Australia**: Over $250,000 for an elderly traveler requiring intensive onboard medical care
* **Uganda to US**: $170,000 for emergency air ambulance
* **China to Belgium**: $28,667 for medical repatriation
* **Jersey to UK**: $14,498 (one of the shorter evacuations)
* **Remote mountain rescue**: £20,000+ for helicopter airlift to nearest hospital

In my years covering travel insurance, evacuation claims are consistently the ones that shock people the most. You think about hospital costs. You budget for potential doctor visits. But a $100,000 helicopter ride? That catches everyone off guard.

# Repatriation and Family Travel Costs

If you're hospitalized for an extended period, someone needs to be there. If you die abroad (sorry, but it happens), your remains need to get home. These aren't small expenses:

* **Family member flights**: $2,000-$6,000 to bring someone to your bedside
* **Extended accommodation**: $100-$300 per night for weeks
* **Repatriation of remains**: $5,000-$15,000+ depending on distance
* **Lost work income**: Immeasurable if you're stuck abroad for weeks

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**: Quality travel insurance covers family member transportation and accommodation if you're hospitalized intensive care. SafetyWing's Essential plan includes up to $6,000 for a relative to visit you if you're in ICU with a life-threatening condition.

# The Cascading Costs of Complications

Medical emergencies abroad rarely stay simple. A moped accident in Thailand might cost £500-£1,000 if treated immediately. But Thailand's humidity means infections are common. That same wound, left untreated or infected, suddenly costs £3,000-£15,000 for hospital admission, antibiotics, skin debridement, or amputation—plus £30,000 for medically escorted repatriation back home.

What starts as a $500 problem becomes a $50,000 disaster because you didn't have coverage.

# What Travel Insurance Actually Covers (And What It Doesn't)

Not all travel insurance is created equal. Here's what you're actually getting when you buy a policy.

# Travel Medical Insurance vs. Comprehensive Travel Insurance

There are two main types, and the distinction matters:

**Travel Medical Insurance** (like SafetyWing Essential):

* Emergency medical treatment and hospitalization
* Emergency dental care
* Medical evacuation to adequate facilities
* Repatriation of remains
* Usually cheaper ($40-$80 per 4 weeks)
* Focuses on keeping you alive and getting you home

**Comprehensive Travel Insurance** (like World Nomads or Allianz plans):

* Everything above, PLUS
* Trip cancellation/interruption
* Travel delays
* Lost or stolen belongings
* Sometimes adventure sports coverage
* More expensive ($100-$300+ per trip)

For long-term travelers and digital nomads, travel medical insurance makes more sense. For short trips where you've prepaid a ton of non-refundable bookings, comprehensive coverage might be worth it.

# Coverage Comparison: What Different Plans Actually Include

|Coverage Type|SafetyWing Essential|SafetyWing Complete|World Nomads|Typical Credit Card|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Emergency Medical**|$250,000 max|$1,500,000 max|Varies|Limited/None|
|**Evacuation**|$100,000 max|$100,000 max|$500,000 max|Limited/None|
|**Emergency Dental**|$1,000|Included|Varies|None|
|**Routine Care**|❌|✅|❌|❌|
|**Pre-existing Conditions**|❌|❌|Sometimes|❌|
|**Trip Cancellation**|❌|❌|✅|✅ (often good)|
|**Deductible**|$0|$0|$100-$500|Varies|
|**Home Country Coverage**|Limited (30 days)|Limited|❌|❌|
|**Monthly Price**|\~$45-$80|\~$140-$200|$150-$400|Free with card|
|**Best For**|Long-term travelers, nomads|Full health coverage needs|Short trips, cancellation|Trip disruption only|

🎯 **Bottom Line**: If you're a digital nomad or long-term traveler, SafetyWing's Essential plan delivers solid medical coverage at a price that doesn't hurt. Need routine care and mental health coverage? The Complete plan is worth considering. Planning a short, expensive vacation with non-refundable bookings? Look at comprehensive coverage from World Nomads or similar.

# What's Typically NOT Covered (Read This Part)

Even with insurance, you're not covered for everything. Common exclusions include:

**Pre-existing Conditions**: If you had symptoms or treatment before your coverage started, it's usually excluded. This includes ongoing issues like diabetes, heart conditions, or cancer treatment.

**High-Risk Activities Without Add-Ons**: BASE jumping, professional sports, racing—these require special coverage. SafetyWing covers many adventure activities (bungee jumping, skiing, surfing, even scooter riding with proper licenses and helmets) but extreme stuff needs add-ons.

**Intoxication-Related Incidents**: Get hurt while drunk? Most policies won't cover you. Even minimal alcohol can void coverage depending on medical reports.

**Non-Emergency Treatment**: Routine checkups, elective procedures, cosmetic surgery—these aren't emergencies, so they're not covered by travel medical insurance.

**Pandemics (Sometimes)**: COVID coverage exists now, but future pandemic coverage may vary. Check your policy specifics.

📌 **Key Takeaway**: Read your policy exclusions before you leave, not after you're in a hospital arguing with the claims department. Five minutes of reading can save you thousands in denied claims.

# Real Traveler Stories: When Insurance Made the Difference

Here's where insurance stops being an abstract concept and becomes the thing that saved someone's financial life.

# The Bangkok Hospital MRI

When I filed a claim after needing an MRI in Chiang Mai, I learned exactly how this process works from the inside. I'd been having knee pain, went to Bangkok Hospital, and the doctor ordered an MRI when an X-ray wasn't helpful.

The MRI cost several hundred dollars—not devastating, but not pocket change either. I filed my claim through SafetyWing's dashboard (took maybe 10 minutes), uploaded receipts and medical notes, and got reimbursed within three weeks. No hassle, no arguing about whether it was ""really necessary,"" just straightforward processing.

That experience changed my entire view of travel insurance. Before that, I'd been skeptical—it felt like paying for something I'd never use. After? I realized it's not about whether you'll use it, but about whether you can afford NOT to have it when you do need it.

# The $12,000 Infection That Insurance Covered

A reader emailed me about his partner's experience visiting family in California. What started as a swollen, painful cheek gland turned into a two-night hospital stay when antibiotics didn't work fast enough. The hospital bill? Over $12,000.

They had insurance. They filed the claim. Insurance covered it all. Without coverage, they'd have been making payment plans for years.

# The Heart Surgery in Switzerland

Another story that stuck with me: a couple hiking in Switzerland when one of them developed a sudden heart problem requiring emergency care and three stents. The Swiss hospital demanded upfront payment before treating him—they carried a credit card with a $25,000 limit specifically for this scenario.

The bill came to $13,000. Allianz paid it all, dealt directly with the hospital, and they didn't have to file a single piece of paperwork. That's how insurance should work.

# The Rabies Shot in Bali

A solo traveler biking through Ubud got chased and bitten by a dog. The bite broke skin, and rabies protocol requires immediate vaccination. In Bali, this meant multiple hospital visits, vaccines, and follow-up care.

Total cost: several hundred dollars. Her insurance covered all of it. Without coverage, she'd have been choosing between potentially deadly disease and destroying her travel budget. With it? She got treatment immediately, filed the claim, got reimbursed, and continued her trip.

✈️ **Traveler Tip**: The best insurance is the kind you forget you have—until the moment you desperately need it and it works exactly as promised. That peace of mind is worth way more than $50 per month.

# How to Choose Coverage That Actually Protects You

Okay, you're convinced you need insurance. Now what? Here's how to pick a plan that'll actually have your back when things go wrong.

# Match Coverage to Your Travel Style

Different travelers need different coverage levels:

**Budget Backpackers & Digital Nomads**:

* Focus on medical emergencies and evacuation
* Skip trip cancellation (you're flexible anyway)
* Look for flexible, subscription-based plans
* **Best option**: SafetyWing Essential (\~$45-$80/month)

**Families Traveling Short-Term**:

* Need trip cancellation coverage (expensive flights for 4+)
* Want comprehensive coverage including delays
* Often traveling to expensive destinations
* **Best option**: Comprehensive plans from Allianz or World Nomads

**Luxury or Adventure Travelers**:

* Higher coverage limits for expensive destinations
* Adventure sports add-ons essential
* May need higher evacuation limits
* **Best option**: Premium plans with add-ons

**Expats & Long-Term Travelers**:

* Need routine care, not just emergencies
* Mental health coverage valuable
* Home country coverage for visits
* **Best option**: SafetyWing Complete or IMG Global

# Critical Features to Look For

When comparing policies, don't just look at price. Check these features:

|Feature|Why It Matters|Minimum Recommended|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Emergency Medical Coverage**|Covers hospital stays, surgery, treatment|$100,000+|
|**Medical Evacuation**|Gets you to proper care or home|$100,000+|
|**Deductible**|What you pay before insurance kicks in|$0-$250 ideal|
|**Pre-existing Condition Coverage**|Crucial if you have ongoing health issues|Case-by-case|
|**Adventure Sports**|Many injuries happen during activities|Check inclusions|
|**COVID Coverage**|Still relevant for some destinations|Verify included|
|**Claims Process Speed**|How fast you get reimbursed|Under 30 days|

# Red Flags to Avoid

Some ""insurance"" is worse than no insurance because it gives false confidence:

❌ **Coverage limits under $50,000**: A single evacuation can exceed this ❌ **Massive deductibles ($1,000+)**: You'll pay most costs anyway ❌ **Exclusions for ""adventure"" activities**: If they don't define what counts as adventure, assume everything is excluded ❌ **No 24/7 support**: Emergencies don't happen during business hours ❌ **Sketchy company reviews**: Check A.M. Best ratings and BBB complaints

🔥 **Hot Take**: The cheapest insurance is often false economy. An extra $20/month for better coverage can save you $20,000 in denied claims. Don't shop on price alone.

# Why SafetyWing Keeps Coming Up in These Discussions

Look, I'm not saying SafetyWing is perfect—no insurance is. But after reviewing dozens of policies and talking to hundreds of travelers about their claim experiences, they consistently deliver what matters most:

**What they do well**:

* Affordable pricing that scales with trip length ($45-$80 per 4 weeks for most travelers)
* Can buy after you've already started traveling (lifesaver if you forgot)
* Subscription model perfect for nomads without fixed return dates
* Coverage in 180+ countries
* $0 deductible means every dollar of claims is covered
* Fast claims processing (average under 3 weeks)
* Actually covers scooter riding (with proper licenses and helmets)
* Home country coverage for short visits

**What they don't do**:

* No pre-existing condition coverage on Essential plan
* No trip cancellation (you'll need separate coverage or credit card benefits)
* Limited routine care on Essential (Complete plan fixes this)
* Age limit of 69 (no coverage for 70+)
* US coverage requires additional add-on

For most digital nomads, remote workers, and long-term travelers, SafetyWing hits the sweet spot of coverage, flexibility, and affordability. If you're over 70, need pre-existing condition coverage, or want trip cancellation, look elsewhere.

# The Math: Is Insurance Actually Worth It?

Let's talk numbers, because at the end of the day, this is a financial decision.

# The Cost-Benefit Breakdown

**SafetyWing Essential Plan**:

* Cost: \~$56 per 4 weeks (ages 10-39)
* That's $1.40 per day
* About $630 per year for continuous coverage

**One Hospital Emergency Without Insurance**:

* US: $2,200+ for ER visit alone
* Switzerland: $1,500-$2,000 for ER visit
* Hospitalization: $5,000+ per night in expensive countries
* Medical evacuation: $20,000-$200,000

Do the math. For less than the cost of two airport coffees per day, you avoid potentially catastrophic medical bills.

# The Actual Question Isn't ""Can I Afford Insurance?""

It's ""Can I afford NOT to have insurance?""

If you had $50,000 sitting in savings that you could burn on a medical emergency without blinking, sure, skip insurance. Self-insure with your own cash.

For the rest of us? That $630 per year is the cheapest peace of mind you'll ever buy.

# What Travelers Actually Spend on Claims

According to data from Tin Leg (Squaremouth's insurance company):

* Average emergency medical claim: $1,654
* Highest medical claim: $62,000
* Average evacuation claim: $17,086
* Highest evacuation claim: $33,640

These aren't made-up worst-case scenarios. These are actual claims paid to actual travelers. Any one of those claims would devastate most travel budgets.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Think of travel insurance like a seatbelt. You don't plan to crash, but you still buckle up every time. The one time you need it, it saves your life (or in this case, your savings).

# Final Thoughts: Don't Gamble With Your Health or Finances

Here's what I've learned after years of traveling, reviewing insurance policies, and talking to travelers who've filed claims:

Insurance isn't about whether you'll get sick or injured. It's about whether you can afford the consequences when you do.

The travelers who skip insurance fall into a few camps:

* ""I'm young and healthy"" (until they're not)
* ""It won't happen to me"" (famous last words)
* ""I'll just be careful"" (accidents don't care how careful you are)
* ""I can't afford it"" (but you can afford a $50,000 hospital bill?)

Every single one of these people changes their tune after one serious medical incident. Don't be the person who learns this lesson the expensive way.

For long-term travelers and digital nomads who want affordable, flexible coverage without the hassle of traditional insurance, SafetyWing delivers. There are more comprehensive options out there, sure. But for what most of us actually need while traveling—emergency medical coverage, evacuation, and peace of mind—this covers it at a price that doesn't hurt.

The hospital bill that shocked me abroad wasn't mine—it was watching other travelers deal with bills they couldn't afford because they'd skipped insurance. Don't be that person.

Get covered. Travel confidently. And when something goes wrong (because eventually, something will), you'll be glad you did.",1,1767761319.0,CoverMadeEasy,0,1.0,False

*As a precaution, she grabbed her spear and entered the kitchen*

*Inside was Peach, who had made a pot of coffee*

**Peach:** ""Oh, hey Vaggi.""

**Peach:** ""Want some? It's fresh.""

*Reluctantly, she took a mug from her.*

*She did, however, wait till Peach took a sip to start*

**Peach:** ""So... you doing alright? Must be hard after what happened.""

Vaggi could tell, she seemed genuinely concerned

**Vaggi:** ""Fine, just a little paranoid""

*Peach eyed Vaggi over her glass thoughtfully*

**Peach:** ""Good. Just know, if you need someone to talk to, my door is always open""

**Vaggi:**"" Oh yeah? And how do you expect to help? You seem to be all sunshine and rainbows! You probably haven't experienced anything close to what I have!""

**MY YEARS IN FLUX** by Mira Hoffman, Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times, Date: c. 211X

So, we were stuck. Marooned on Mars with zero way back to the *Lucky Luke* and no line to Earth. The ship probably got a distress signal out before the crash, but right now, we were basically ghosts to the rest of the world.

Captain Nadia Rhodes wasn't interested in a pity party—not while we were burning through precious oxygen. Our mission commander is basically made of titanium and coffee, and she doesn't do ""giving up.""

“Listen up,” she snapped, her voice echoing in my helmet. “Everyone’s alive, which is a start. Now, we inventory the wreckage. Kazumi, Kai—go through the storage and tell me what isn't junk. Mira, Silas—you’re with me. We need a roof over our heads before the sun drops.”

Just like that, I was part of the team. My official job title on the manifest was ""Content & Documentation Specialist""—meaning I was the fluxer meant to stream our triumphs to a billion followers back home. But with the comms array smashed into a million pieces, there was no one to ""flux"" to. My new job? Muscle. Basically, I was just a grunt.

We found the microfiber package labeled “Main Quarters” and thankfully it was intact and on top. Dr. Silas Varma, our lead scientist, and I found a nice flat place to put it. Silas usually spends his time looking at microbes under a microscope, but he was surprisingly handy with a cargo winch.

Behind us, Kazumi and Kai were already tearing into the storage containers like their lives depended on it—which, honestly, they did. Our chief engineer and our ace pilot were knee-deep in crates, scanning barcodes and checking seals to see what actually survived the impact.

""Keep moving, Mira,"" Silas muttered, wiping red dust off his visor. ""The temperature's going to dive in two hours, and I'd rather not be a popsicle when the fans back home finally see your footage.""

I checked my wrist-cam. The ""Offline"" light was a depressing shade of red, but I kept the record button pinned anyway. If we were going down, I was going to make sure someone, someday, saw how hard we fought back.

Nadia hauled a heavy-duty sled over to us, loaded down with a compressor and a couple of high-pressure air tanks. We spent the next thirty minutes on our hands and knees, obsessively checking every seal and inch of the microfiber skin for tears. If there was even one pinhole, this whole thing was just a really expensive body bag. Once we were sure it wasn't a death trap, we signaled Kazumi and Kai to drop the inventory and join us. It was time for the main event: the inflation and the external bracing.

The compressor kicked in with a low, vibrating hum that felt like a heartbeat. Watching that microfiber skin bloat and stretch was like watching a ghost come to life. While the habitat took shape, I was hauling the solar arrays—twenty sleek, heavy slabs of silicon that were our only ticket to a warm night. Kazumi was already wrestling with the exterior interface, her fingers flying as she slotted in the battery blocks. They were green-lit and fully juiced, enough to keep us going for a week as long as we didn't get greedy with the heaters.

Kai jumped in to help me pivot the panels one by one. We aligned them dead-north, making sure the micro-motors were primed to hunt the sun the second it cleared the horizon. We even double-checked the night-shrouds—the automatic silver covers that snap shut to protect the glass from the freezing cold or the sandpaper effect of a Martian dust storm. If those failed, we’d be sitting in a dark, silent tent by Tuesday.

While we were playing tetris with the solar slabs, Nadia and Silas were wrestling the airlock into position. This thing was a serious piece of tech—super advanced, zero-leak, and built like a vault—but it was a total bottleneck. It could only cycle two people at a time, and the ""empty"" cycle was a grueling twenty-minute wait while the pumps fought the Martian vacuum. The refill? That was the easy part—ten seconds of a massive *whoosh* and you’re inside. It’s basically the world's most high-stakes elevator, and right now, it was our only way into the one place on this planet that wasn't trying to kill us.

Stepping inside was the first time I'd felt my heart rate drop since the crash. It wasn't just a plastic bubble; the interior walls were lined with a soft, warm-toned fabric that made the place feel less like a lab and more like a home. We spent the rest of the day in a blur of motion, clicking the five living alcoves into place and getting the micro-kitchen online. By sunset, we even had the communal space set up with the monitors and the local server. It was loaded with enough entertainment vids to last us a decade, which felt like a weirdly grim insurance policy.

Nadia stood in the center of the communal area, her helmet finally off. She looked like she’d aged five years in five hours, but she managed a tired smile.

“Good work, everyone,” she said, her voice sounding small without the suit’s speakers. “Congratulations on a job well done. Now, let's get some warm food in us and survive our first night on Mars. Tomorrow, we start the real work.”

I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep with the excitement and all that, but ""tomorrow"" came in an instant. That’s what hard work does to you—it skips the loading screen.

Breakfast was fast, and then we hit the briefing. ""First priority is long-term survival,"" Nadia said, pacing the small communal space. ""What did we lose in the crash?""

“The good news? The shock absorbers and the landing rockets saved the shuttle's shell, so we've got the hardware,"" Kai said, leaning against a storage crate. ""The bad news? The engines are toast, and the high-gain comm unit was turned into a pancake.""

""Then we focus on the basics,"" Nadia decided. ""Food, water, oxygen. Once we're stable, we figure out how to phone home. Maybe they'll send a rescue op, maybe they won't, but we aren't waiting around to find out.""

Easier said than done. It took five years to build the *Lucky Luke*, and I knew for a fact there wasn't a backup ship even on the drawing board.

“I suggest we build a small temple to *'The True Path of the Void Hermit,'*” I joked, flashing a grin. Everyone actually laughed. Even in the middle of a disaster, everyone knew about the Hermit’s supposed miracles—though the Hermit himself probably wouldn't care if we were stranded on Pluto, let alone Mars.

The next few weeks were a blur of ""real work."" We scouted ice patches, hooked up the refineries for water and oxygen, and I got stuck with the most glamorous job of all: the insect farm. Turns out, my followers back home would've loved the ""Protein Queen"" content, but here, it was just me and a lot of crickets. Kai and I spent our extra hours on the vegetable plots, trying to grow enough greens to keep us—and the bugs—alive. I kept fluxing the whole thing, recording silly interviews with the crew to keep our spirits up.

Then the ""Routine"" hit. And on Mars, routine is just another word for ""trying not to lose your mind."" To keep the space-madness at bay, Nadia had us spend our evenings brainstorming the ultimate comeback story—how to actually talk to Earth again. Silas was the one who finally cracked the code.

""Look, we went full high-tech, and look where that got us,"" Silas said during one of our nightly huddles, giving us a tired smile. ""The digital array is fried. You can't repair a shattered quantum processor with a multi-tool. So, we’re going analog. Short range.""

“How does short range help?” Kai asked, skeptical. “The ship’s brain is fully digital.”

“The comm array is, yeah. But the scientific suite? That’s a different story,” Silas explained. “The ship is in auto-orbit, snapping high-res pics of the surface to see if anything changes.”

“We’re the change!” I interrupted, getting that old fluxer spark back.

“Exactly. It’ll detect the camp and beam the images back eventually. But it’s also listening for radio noise on every frequency. So, we build the most archaic radio device possible and send pulses. Three shorts, three longs, three shorts. Morse code. SOS. If that doesn't get the AI’s attention, I’m officially retiring to a crater.”

So, we all became ""Analog Ops"" specialists overnight. My job? Building the ""Antenna-Foil Monster."" I spent days crafting a massive three-meter antenna out of scrap metal and literal kitchen foil. It was a total monstrosity—looked like a giant's DIY science project gone wrong—and the emitter we hooked up to it was a frankenstein-beast of old wires and stone-age tech.

But when we finally flipped the switch, it felt like we were throwing a flare into the dark. We started sending our first message of hope into the stars, praying someone, or something, was listening.

I need some advice for buying my first electric coffee grinder for my espresso (I currently use an 1zpresso J-Max, which is great but a bit tough to grind at finer settings and not as good for filter coffee). I've laid out my thoughts below but would love some more perspectives! Budget is in Australian dollars.

Varia VS3 - Pros:

* Look, feel and build quality looks exceptional
* Relatively quiet compared to competitors
* Low retention
* Includes an RDT bottle in the box

Cons:

* Whilst it's great there is an upgrade path for the burrs, you have to pay a significant amount to upgrade from the stock to the Hypernova Ultra (not far off 50% of the base grinder price), which puts it into competition with more capable grinders.
* 38mm seems quite small for this sort of price.
* Slow grind speed.
* The Gen 1 had lots of known issues including stalling, stripped gears and grind collar moving under higher loads. It seems like these have been fixed under Gen 2 but would like to hear of some experiences.

DF54 - Pros:

* Seems pretty simple - basically plug and play out of the box
* Pretty good from a workflow perspective
* Reviews seem to indicate that it brews great coffee

Cons:

* Limited burr upgrade path as 54mm flat burrs are harder to come by than their 64mm counterparts.
* Seems like it has a lot of issues with static and keeping the plasma ioniser clean.
* Really hate the plastic catch cup - seriously, for this price, it can't be that hard to include a nicer metal one.
* Not sure about customer service.

Overall, I think I'm leaning towards the Varia but want some more advice. I tend to favour Light-Medium to Medium roasts and like a bit of texture but want some more clarity in the cup too.",1,1767760959.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1:

Richard Sterling had no idea that the timid new accountant who fumbled through expense reports was the same woman who owned him every night online. Nella Chen kept her eyes down at work, apologized for taking up space, and let him bark orders at her like she was nothing. But when the office emptied and the city lights flickered on, she became someone else entirely. A faceless domme in black silk who made powerful men weak, who whispered commands that had them opening their wallets and begging for more. Richard had been serving his Goddess for six months, transferring tributes twice a week, never once seeing her face. He had no clue she sat three desks away, watching him with those quiet brown eyes, planning exactly how this would unfold.

The hints started subtle because that’s how Nella did everything. She wore her hair pulled back tight one Monday, the same severe style from a photo his Goddess had sent. She noticed how he stared for half a second too long before snapping at her about formatting errors. Then came the bracelet, silver with a black onyx stone, identical to the one in gloved hands he’d seen on his screen. His coffee cup had actually trembled when he spotted it during a meeting. Nella had smiled that nervous smile she always wore, but inside she felt that familiar thrill. The one she got when a man started to realize he was already caught in her web, that struggling would only pull the threads tighter. She’d learned long ago that force wasn’t necessary when you understood exactly what someone needed. And Richard Sterling, for all his bluster and cruelty, needed this more than his next breath.

Three weeks later she stayed late on purpose, making sure they’d be alone. He walked past her desk and actually paused, something shifting in his expression when he looked at her. “Working hard, Miss Chen?” His voice had gone softer, uncertain in a way she’d never heard at work. She glanced up through her lashes and said she was just trying to meet his standards, that they were very high. “That’s because I see potential in you,” he’d replied, and the words hung between them like smoke. Nella tilted her head, let silence stretch for three heartbeats, then asked if he saw everything. She watched him open his mouth and close it again, confusion and something else playing across his features. That night his Goddess sent a voice message in that tone he craved, asking if he’d figured out who she really was. His response came back in minutes, desperate and pleading. She didn’t answer for two days.

Friday afternoon Nella wore all black. Not obviously provocative but the dress fit her in a way that suggested the silhouette he worshipped online, the heels were the exact ones from Wednesday’s photo, and when she knocked on his office door she didn’t wait for permission to enter. She locked it behind her with a quiet click that seemed loud in the sudden tension. Richard looked up from his computer and something in his face cracked open, fear and recognition and desperate hope all tangled together. “I think we need to discuss your performance review,” Nella said quietly, and her voice had changed. Not the timid whisper he was used to but something measured and certain. She walked toward his desk with deliberate steps and perched on the edge, crossing her legs. “You’ve been very demanding of me, Mr. Sterling.” He tried to protest, to pretend he didn’t understand, but she just smiled and asked when he’d figured it out. “The bracelet,” he whispered, and the surrender in that admission was everything she’d been working toward.

She reached out and traced one finger along his jaw, gentle but firm, the way you’d handle something precious that belonged to you. “You’ve been such a harsh boss,” she said softly. “So cruel to your junior accountant. But that’s because you need someone to take all that control away, isn’t it?” He was barely breathing, frozen between his professional persona and the submissive self he’d been hiding. Nella let the silence build until it was almost unbearable, then she said in that voice he knew from his darkest nights, “Kneel.” She watched him war with himself for maybe five seconds before his body made the decision his mind couldn’t. Richard Sterling sank from his executive chair onto the carpet of his own office, and the word that came out was barely a whisper. “Goddess.” Nella felt that satisfaction roll through her, the particular pleasure of a plan executed perfectly. “That’s not quite right,” she corrected, still gentle. “At work you’ll call me Miss Nella. We need to maintain some propriety, don’t we?”

“Now listen carefully,” she continued, running her thumb across his lower lip while he trembled. “You’re going to start treating me with respect during business hours. You’re going to mentor me properly, recognize my work, and remember exactly who you’re speaking to every time you want to bark an order.” He nodded frantically and she smiled. “Good. And Richard, your tributes double starting today. Consider it payment for all those times you made me feel small.” She paused, letting him process that. “We’ll have private sessions here after hours where you’ll serve me the way you’ve been begging to. You’ll worship properly, on your knees, grateful for the privilege.” His eyes were closed, his breathing ragged, and when he opened his wallet with shaking hands Nella accepted what he offered with the same patient grace she brought to everything. Some women seized power loud and violent but she preferred this, the slow inevitable pull that made men realize they’d been hers all along. “Very good boy,” she murmured, and meant it. After all, Richard Sterling was learning his lesson perfectly, one careful step at a time.",1,1767760783.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,1.0,False

After bugging 10+ RSMs and senior reps to meet with me for coffee or phone calls just to prove that I have what it takes to do this job, I finally received an offer today and I'm super excited to start!

  
Moral of this is that persistence pays off! I thought this day would never come and because I was persistent and kept on these RSMs and senior reps, I now have a job. 

  
Hope this is encouraging to those who are still looking and might be in the same boat that I am/was. ",10,1767760578.0,MedicalDevices,4,0.92,False

I’m having a recent dilemma with my family. It’s a super long story. To explain the situation i have to give some basic context, so buckle yo ass up. 

My sister got married to a guy. Let’s call her T and him M. He seemed nice. All is fine. They get married and all is good. A few months after the wedding I get a notification on my phone that says “Your phone contact Luke created a new kik app profile”. See the thing is i don’t know anyone named Luke. I clicked on the profile and it turned out to be M and he had created a fake profile. Sus. I made a fake profile of a random local girl and wanted to find out what his sneaky little ass was doing. Long story short he said lots of incriminating this. I brought the evidence to T after a wee of messaging. I had arranged a meet up and M was planning to meet this fake local girl at a coffee shop (he also told this girl he likes to fuck on the first date). Always, she blows of up phone before we can catch him in the act of meeting this girl at the coffee shop. But long story short he denies everything and she believes it. Also i call bull on that. 

Fast forward a few years and a few kids later. It’s obviously kind of awkward being around him and we don’t talk at family event so basically try to avoid each other. He’s basically also turned into more of a loser of the years and managed to turn into an alcoholic, lose his job, threaten to report my other family member for fraud, and almost put T into near finically ruin after filing for bankruptcy. He then later had mental break, drove to another state with a gun and was gone for like a week without any word. My sister felt abandoned and filed for divorce after this. Last was last year. 

Fast forward to present day. He is still coming to family holidays and events. Year after year. My husband hates him. He’s doesn’t really talk to anyone. M and T just bicker at each other the whole time. And he’s just in general really weird. 

They also sold their house together this winter yay right? Nope…. They bought another together. Ya, fucking weird.  

It’s so fucked up. So getting to the point of this story. This year i messaged her and asked if her exhusband was going to yet again be coming to Christmas. I told her i was not comfortable being him for obvious reasons. She got mad. Said i was selfish and only think about myself and don’t care about her family. She also still blames the messaging i incident on me and that i catfished him. Like yes bitch, i did catfish him and caught its stupid ass. But it’s not my fault that he did what he did. 

AITA for not wanting him around? I told my mom that me and my husband can start coming to holidays earlier and leave before they get there. It’s sounds petty but it’s been 6 years of walking around on egg shells around him. ",2,1767760213.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

**T+03:21:00 (Pulse 134)**  
*Venus Orbiter Operations, Night Shift Room with Dim Lights*

Night shift rooms always felt like the inside of a submarine: dim light, muted voices, and the quiet arrogance of humans thinking they could keep watch over planets with coffee and screens.

The monitors cast a soft blue glow across the faces of the two operators on duty. Everything else was shadow: empty chairs, coiled headset cords, a vending machine humming like a bored insect. The air smelled faintly of warm plastic and stale caffeine.

On the main display, VESPER hung in its orbit around Venus like a patient lantern, a machine with a job and no opinions about it. Its instruments watched the planet in ultraviolet and infrared, and listened to the ionosphere the way a physician listened to a chest, hunting for murmurs that meant trouble.

Rina Torres had been trained to treat the Sun like weather. Space weather was still weather: probabilities, indices, timing windows. You learned the patterns, you learned the hazards, you learned to stay humble.

But the alert that slid onto her console didn’t feel like weather.

It felt like a verdict trying to wear a forecast’s clothing.

SOLAR EVENT PROBABILITY RISING  
UNUSUAL GLOBAL OSCILLATION DETECTED  
POSSIBLE EXTREME FLARE/CME NEAR-TERM

Rina’s face went warm, that quick flush of adrenaline that always arrived half a second before the rational brain caught up. She clicked open the packet, scanning the words again, as if they might soften into something routine if she stared hard enough.

Unusual global oscillation.

As if the Sun had decided to start tapping its foot.

She pulled up Venus’ induced magnetotail data. Normally, it was a living mess, exactly the kind of mess she trusted: the solar wind slamming into Venus’ upper atmosphere, draping magnetic field lines around the planet, flexing and snapping and reforming. Venus didn’t have Earth’s strong internal magnetic shield. It had a borrowed one, an induced one, a temporary umbrella made out of a constant argument between plasma and field.

Tonight the argument looked… constrained.

The magnetotail was tightening, not in a gradual drift but in a patterned squeeze, like someone was cinching a drawstring at regular intervals. Compression, release. Compression, release. The same signature appearing in multiple channels.

Rina leaned forward until her eyes were too close to the plot.

“That’s not-” she started, then stopped because finishing the sentence felt like making a claim the universe would punish.

Her console beeped.

A small, polite sound. A system notice.

But the timing of it made her skin go cold.

She glanced at the timestamp. Then at the previous marker.

Ninety seconds.

A pulse.

The magnetotail tightened. The ionosphere response spiked. Particle counts fluttered upward like a startled flock.

Ninety seconds later, it happened again.

Rina’s mind tried the standard list, the comfortable inventory of reasons:

Instrument cycle. Telemetry cadence. Data packet batching.

She checked the metadata. The sampling rates were not ninety seconds. The packet timing wasn’t synchronized that way. Different instruments, different clocks, and yet the planet was responding as if it had been taught a rhythm.

A third pulse arrived, right on schedule.

Rina’s throat went dry. She turned to her teammate, a man with tired eyes and a posture that suggested he’d been awake for years.

“You seeing this?” she asked.

He rolled his chair closer, leaned in, and stared at the overlay without speaking for a long moment. In the dim light, his face looked older than it probably was.

Finally he said, “That’s… rhythmic.”

Rina felt the word land in her chest like a weight.

Rhythmic meant driven.

Driven meant agency, or at least forcing. It meant something upstream wasn’t simply flaring and relaxing the way solar wind normally did. It meant something had introduced a clean periodicity into a system that lived on chaos.

She toggled the ultraviolet nightside feed. Venus’ faint airglow should have been a quiet smear, soft and constant.

Instead the emission was beginning to lift in synchronized flickers, as if the atmosphere itself was being tapped with a steady finger. Not an aurora yet. Not a storm yet.

A tremor.

A warning tremor.

Rina’s mind reached for something to say that wasn’t fear.

“It’s like…” She stopped. She didn’t want to say heartbeat. That word belonged to living things. The Sun was not supposed to have one you could set a watch by.

Another beep.

Pulse 134.

Venus’ induced shield tightened again, and Rina imagined the solar wind arriving not as a gusty river but as a set of measured waves, one after another, with a precision the Sun did not naturally possess.

Somewhere far away, eight minutes of light-time away, the star was doing something no star was supposed to do.

And here, wrapped in dim light and cheap coffee, Venus was answering the rhythm like a drumskin.

Rina swallowed and keyed her mic.

“Log this as coherent periodic compression,” she said, forcing her voice into the calm tone that made emergencies feel manageable. “Cross-check particle flux channels. If this escalates into a CME impact profile, I want timing on the first-arrival radiation front versus bulk plasma.”

Her teammate nodded slowly, but his eyes never left the plot.

Because the scariest part wasn’t that something might hit Venus.

The scariest part was that the universe had started keeping time.

And Venus, the planet that couldn’t protect itself the way Earth could, was already being squeezed to the beat.

It’s not a popular account, but it’s the kind of account that other obsessives watch like hawks. Replies come in from different time zones, from basements and garages and backyards where antennas point at the sky like question marks.

“YES.”  
“Thought it was my setup.”  
“Not my setup.”

Someone adds: “This is global.”

The word global lands like a stone.

---

**T+03:37:02 (Pulse 142)**

A short video hits the feed, ripped from a screen recording, shaky enough to feel illicit. It’s a scrolling dataset with a faint periodic pattern, and a voice off-camera whispers as if the universe can hear.

“It’s… it’s every ninety seconds. It’s like it’s breathing.”

The video ends with a hard cut, the kind that happens when someone realizes they’re recording something they’re not supposed to record.

The comments are immediate.

“Fake.”  
“ARG?”  
“This is from a real dashboard, I’ve seen that UI.”  
“Why is nobody talking about this??”

Someone is talking about it. Everyone is, now.

It gets more engagement in two minutes than the original plot got in five.

That’s how it spreads: not as a warning, but as entertainment. The brain’s way of touching a hot stove with a glove.

---

**T+03:39:44 (Pulse 146 + 44 seconds)**

A livestream starts, titled with a question that is trying to disguise itself as clickbait.

“IS THE SUN… SYNCING?”

The host is a mid-tier science communicator with a calm voice and a ring light. You can see the fear in the way they keep smiling.

They hold up the same plot. Then another. Then a third.

They say “likely instrumentation” three times in four minutes, each time less convincing, each time sounding like someone reading the safety card while the plane is already shaking.

The viewer count climbs anyway.

---

**T+03:41:05**

A leaked audio clip appears. Twelve seconds long. No context. Just voices on a conference line, compressed and grainy, but unmistakably adult.

“…our current best description is: the Sun is syncing.”

Silence. A dry cough. Then, faintly, someone mutters:

“Maybe it’s aliens.”

The clip cuts off.

The internet does what it always does with a forbidden sentence: it repeats it until it becomes real.

---

**T+03:42:30 (Pulse 148 + 30 seconds)**

A hashtag is born, not because it’s clever, but because it’s simple.

#SunSync

It begins trending in pockets, then spills. People post their own interpretations like offerings.

“This is definitely a military test.”  
“This is definitely a solar cycle thing.”  
“This is definitely the end times.”  
“This is definitely fake.”

Everyone is certain. Certainty is cheaper than fear.

---

**T+03:44:07**

A journalist at a reputable outlet posts the most dangerous sentence in modern society:

“Hearing chatter from multiple observatories about an unusual solar oscillation. Trying to confirm.”

That sentence makes it legal, in the public mind, to be afraid.

A flood of replies demands answers the journalist cannot give.

“Is it dangerous?”  
“Is this why my GPS glitched?”  
“Is this related to the aurora last week?”  
“Aliens???”

The journalist replies with caution.

“No evidence of immediate danger. Still verifying.”

The public reads: they don’t want to tell us.

**T+03:46:30 (Pulse 151)**  
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

By three and a half hours in, the control room had the atmosphere of a courthouse right before a verdict. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just a dense quiet threaded with the small sounds of people trying not to make mistakes while history watched.

On the wall, the Sun no longer looked like weather.

It looked like a structure under load.

The corona, normally a lacework of looped fury and tangled brilliance, had been combed into a symmetry that made Mara’s skin crawl. The loops were still there, still arcing and folding and glowing, but the messiness had been reduced into a small set of preferred curvatures, as if the field had been forced into a cleaner topology. Too many arcs shared the same radius. Too many footpoints aligned. Too many features held still when they should have jittered.

Order can be stability.

Order can also be tension.

Mara kept the EUV channels stacked beside the magnetograms and the Doppler maps, watching the same region from three angles of truth. In the helioseismic overlays the ninety-second mode kept landing like a hammer strike: disk-wide, phase-stable, refusing to broaden or wander. In the line-of-sight velocity maps, the photosphere “breathed” in a coherent global oscillation, a subtle in-and-out that ought to have been shredded by convection and differential rotation but wasn’t.

The phase stayed locked.

That was the obscene part. Not the amplitude. The fidelity.

Jun stood close enough that Mara could hear his breath catch every time the next pulse approached, as if his body had started anticipating the universe like it was a metronome in the next room.

“It’s compressing complexity,” he said, and it wasn’t a metaphor. He was looking at the helicity proxies, the braided twist of the magnetic field, collapsing.

Mara followed his gaze. The twist metrics were trending down with a stubborn monotony, like a system being driven toward a low-entropy configuration it hadn’t chosen. In normal corona evolution, stress accumulates in tangles: shear, twist, braided currents. It looks like messy hair because it is messy hair. Energy storage in the field lives in that mess.

But here the mess was being organized.

“Like combing,” Mara murmured, more to keep her voice steady than because she liked the comparison.

Jun made a sound that wasn’t quite a laugh. “Yeah,” he said. “Until the comb hits a knot.”

Pulse 151 arrived.

And the knot announced itself.

It didn’t start as a flare. Not a bloom, not a flash. It started as a failure of geometry.

On the EUV feed a long, thin structure near the limb began to deform in a way Mara had seen in smaller events a thousand times: a filament channel, a dark ribbon of cooler, denser plasma suspended in a magnetic trough, losing equilibrium. The spine of it bowed upward, subtle at first, then with accelerating inevitability. Its anchoring points held… and then didn’t, not by snapping like a rope, but by slipping, as if the field lines were being made to reconfigure faster than the plasma could follow.

A kink-mode signature bloomed in real time: the filament writhed, twisting around itself, the classic helical deformation of a current-carrying flux rope that has been pushed past stability. At the same time, the surrounding coronal loops began to lean toward it, not randomly, but in coordinated motion, as if the entire magnetic arcade had been tuned into the same mechanical response.

“Pre-eruptive rise,” someone said behind her, voice too tight. “It’s lifting.”

Mara’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, still not touching, as if contact might make it more real. Her eyes flicked to the magnetogram-derived field extrapolations: the modeled connectivity was changing. Footpoint mapping shifted. The magnetic skeleton of the region was reorganizing into fewer, cleaner connections, the way a stressed truss might redistribute load right before a buckle.

Then came the first true sign of imminent failure: a brightening that wasn’t a flare, but a seam.

Along a narrow line beneath the rising filament, a linear EUV enhancement ignited. Not a dot. Not a patch. A line, too straight, too fast, tracing the onset of a current sheet forming where the field was being stretched and thinned. It looked less like weather and more like fracture mechanics, a crack tip appearing in a stressed material.

Mara’s stomach went cold.

“That’s a reconnection front,” Jun whispered, and the word front carried all the wrong implications. Fronts propagate. Fronts spread.

The bright line lengthened. The filament rose faster. Adjacent loops snapped into new shapes with an ugly smoothness, as if the corona had been waiting for permission to change configuration and had finally received it. In the Doppler maps, flows along the filament channel surged. In the irradiance proxies, the region’s output began to climb, not as a sudden spike, but as the ramp of a system stepping from stable to metastable to gone.

The warning tone began, triggered by threshold algorithms that didn’t care about narrative.

It didn’t stop.

Exposure shutters adjusted. Gain dropped. The image hunted for balance and failed to find it because the underlying scene was no longer balancing anything. It was transitioning.

Mara watched the filament’s spine cross a point that made her throat tighten: the rise was no longer being resisted. The structure had left its equilibrium basin. The field had lost the ability to hold it down.

This wasn’t the flare yet.

This was the pre-flare structural failure: a coronal flux rope breaking containment, the magnetic cage deforming under a driver that didn’t drift, didn’t jitter, didn’t hesitate.

A system tightened too neatly.

A system about to release.

Somewhere behind her, someone said, “It’s going,” in the flat voice of a person watching a bridge begin to fold.

Mara didn’t answer. Her brain was trying to drag the event into familiar categories: filament eruption, tether-cutting reconnection, torus instability, runaway. The physics was all there, all textbook.

What wasn’t textbook was the timing.

Pulse 151. Right on schedule.

She heard herself exhale, thin and involuntary, and then she said, very softly, because saying it louder wouldn’t make it less true:

“Oh no.”

**T+03:47:30**

An amateur astronomer posts a photo of the Sun through proper solar filters, with a long disclaimer about safety, and then the honest truth:

“You won’t SEE it. You’ll see it in the numbers.”

That line gets quoted and requoted, because it’s the first thing that feels like a map.

The numbers are becoming the monster. The numbers, normally tame, are now telling a story no one rehearsed.

---

**T+03:49:30 (Pulse 153)**

A university PR account tries to douse the fire with a cup of water.

“We are aware of reports of unusual solar data. Please rely on official sources. Do not share unverified information.”

The replies are merciless.

“Then VERIFY it.”  
“What are you hiding?”  
“Official sources are always last.”

The PR account posts again, slower, as if typing through wet cement.

“Solar observations are complex. Anomalies can result from instrumentation.”

The public hears: This is real.

---

**T+03:50:30 (Pulse 147)**

The first credible thread appears, the kind written by someone who knows enough to be dangerous but also knows enough to be careful.

A solar physicist, anonymous avatar, posts:

“This is not a solar cycle signature. This is not one instrument. We’re seeing phase coherence across multiple datasets. Still investigating. Please don’t stare at the Sun. Please don’t panic.”

The thread goes viral anyway.

Not because it says “panic.”

Because it implies that panic is a reasonable consideration.

**T+03:52:00 (Pulse 148)**

The metronome memes get darker.

A metronome overlaid on a clip of a ticking clock. The Sun behind it. The caption:

“WHEN THE STAR STARTS COUNTING”

People laugh and share it and then, quietly, check the sky as if the Sun might look back.

**T+03:51:40 to T+03:52:20 (Between Pulse 154 to 155)**  
*SWPC, Boulder*

The first sign that the day was getting away from them didn’t come from the Sun.

It came from a phone.

“DeShawn,” Liz said, and there was a tone in her voice that belonged to accidents. Not the kind you cleaned up with an email, the kind you cleaned up with lawyers. She held her screen out like it might bite.

On it: a grainy twelve-second clip, reposted thousands of times, tagged with #SunSync and a dozen uglier variations. The audio was unmistakable, even compressed and chopped. Adult voices. A conference line. That one sentence, clean as a razor.

“…our current best description is: the Sun is syncing.”

Then the little laugh, the muttered word everyone wished hadn’t been captured:

“Maybe it’s aliens.”

The clip ended. The internet had already done what it always did: looped it, captioned it, remixed it, set it to a metronome sound, turned it into a punchline so it wouldn’t have to become fear.

DeShawn felt the room’s attention shift, the way a flock turns when one bird sees the hawk. A dozen heads leaned in. Someone said, “That was our call.”

“Jesus,” someone else whispered, and not as prayer.

DeShawn didn’t touch the phone. He didn’t need to. He could already hear the chain reaction: PR calls, congressional staffers, a thousand inboxes filling with demands that started with Is this true? and ended with What aren’t you telling us?

“Okay,” he said, voice calm in the way a tourniquet is calm. “We keep the language conservative. We say ‘anomalous oscillation’ and ‘ongoing investigation.’ We do not speculate. We do not-”

A shrill, polite alarm cut him off.

Not a phone notification. Not an email chime.

A system alarm.

On the big screen, a plot that had been moving like weather suddenly behaved like a guillotine.

X-ray flux climbed so fast it stopped being a curve and became a vertical line.

For half a second the room froze, brains trying to reconcile the leak with the new reality, trying to decide which emergency deserved the first breath.

Then chairs scraped back. Someone swore loud. Another person stood so abruptly their headset cord snapped tight.

DeShawn’s coffee tipped and spilled, unnoticed.

“X-ray spike!” someone called, as if volume could turn it into less.

DeShawn’s eyes moved the way training demanded: not to the biggest screen, but to the confirmation chain.

GOES X-ray: pegging upward.

EUV feed: blooming into saturation, protection flags tripping.

Proton monitors: beginning their first nervous climb, the early wake-up before the storm.

Magnetograms: a sudden twitch, field lines reorganizing faster than they had any right to.

For eight minutes, the public would still be staring at an ordinary Sun. For eight minutes, the world would be arguing in comment sections while the radiation front raced outward at light speed, already unstoppable.

But here, in Boulder, the numbers had already screamed.

On a separate display, coronagraph data lagged behind by processing time, the way everything lagged behind by physics. The Sun’s limb brightened, then tore in a way that made even seasoned forecasters inhale sharply.

Not a small, localized eruption.

A structured release.

A massive coronal expulsion beginning to lift off with an eerie coherence, like a shell forming, like a fist unclenching.

“That’s not a normal CME,” Liz said, and her voice had lost its PR concern entirely. This was the older fear, the one that lived in people who had watched space weather eat satellites.

DeShawn heard Jun’s metaphor from earlier relayed through the day’s chain of conversations, as if it had become a shared myth.

The comb hits the knot.

“No,” DeShawn said, and he hated how steady he sounded. “That’s the knot.”

The room became a storm of voices and keystrokes.

“Run propagation!”  
“Direction, direction, direction!”  
“Any SEP signatures yet?”  
“Radio blackout risk?”  
“Get coronagraph confirmation!”  
“Do we have STEREO angle?”  
“Where is it pointed?”

And because the leak had just lit the public on fire, the next question came fast, sharpened by dread:

“What do we say?”

DeShawn didn’t answer that yet. Words were not the priority. Physics didn’t wait for messaging.

He snapped to the comms panel and stabbed a button. “I want the Sun monitoring station on a dedicated line. Now. Patch them in or open parallel. I need their eyes and their coronagraphs, full resolution.”

A tech’s fingers flew. Somewhere, a phone started ringing into a room that hadn’t heard the alarm tones yet.

A senior scientist, pale under the fluorescents, spoke like someone reciting a checklist to keep panic from becoming contagious. “Bulk CME travel time is hours. Minimum. But the radiation front is already on its way. That’s… effectively immediate.”

DeShawn looked at the wall clock and then, reflexively, at the live solar feed that was already eight minutes old. The cruelest part of this work was always the same: the universe moved at light speed, and human comprehension moved in conference calls.

On the still-open conference line, Elias Venn’s voice came through, quiet enough that DeShawn had to lean toward the speaker.

“That’s the purge,” Elias said, and this time the word didn’t sound like theory.

It sounded like a step in a procedure.

No one laughed. Not because humor had died, but because humor required the comfort of thinking you were in control.

And in that moment, with a viral leak on the internet and a star-sized event unfolding eight minutes ahead of their eyes, control felt like the oldest lie in the room.

I've been working on a social app called TWIBS that helps people get together with friends. I would love some testers to provide honest feedback and constructive criticism.

The basic idea is to make it easier to let your friends know about casual hangs, e.g. “Anyone want to do the Elysian Park trail on Sunday morning?” by dropping on a pin on the map, without having to spam group chats and text everyone you know. You can type that exact query into the AI Chat, and it will automatically look up the address for the trail and select the best 3D icon for the activity (in this case, a hiking signpost). 

You can also post a flyer or paste a link to an event, and the data will be automatically fetched from the image or URL so you can easily see which friends are going to upcoming shows near you.

Part of the motivation for creating an app like this was to make it easier for people to connect IRL. Life in post-Covid world can be very isolating, and my hope is that an app like this can make it fun to plan stuff and generally lower the bar for getting together in-person. I’ve found it especially useful for automatically pinging friends who frequent the same gyms/coffee shops by having them add those spots to their favorites so that we can easily let each other know when we go to those places. We’ve  also been using it as a quick and simple alternative to Partiful for things like small group dinners.

I'm looking for any kind of feedback, but especially curious about what specific use cases come to mind for you as a tester. Is this an app you would actually use? Why or why not? What can we do to make it better? 

TWIBS is completely free to use, but I’m including an invite code so that I can keep track of how people found it. Totally optional, but if you wouldn't mind, please use code TESTMYAPP during sign up.

Thank you!
