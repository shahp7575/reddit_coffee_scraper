1qecav2,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1qecav2/parking_tips_for_robert_morris_university/,parking tips for robert morris university colonials mens hockey vs. holy cross crusaders mens college hockey at clearview arena (pittsburgh 01/23),"  
  
hey folks, figured i'd share some parking advice for the holy cross game on friday, 01/23 at 7:00 pm. clearview arena hockey is honestly a great time, but the one real pain is getting on and especially off neville island. since the official lot is free, it’s not the cost of parking you worry about, it’s the traffic backing up on grand avenue when everyone leaves at once. this bottleneck happens because the island is only accessible via i-79 or the yellow belt, so that’s where the traffic hits, both before and after the game.  
  
first thing, i gotta mention Prked. honestly, it’s the best way to skip the official lot congestion and the whole island bottleneck. because the venue is on neville island, there aren't many alternative parking lots at all. your best bet for a super fast exit is using the Prked app to snag a local's driveway or garage right next to the rmu island sports center. even though the official lot is free, paying a little on Prked guarantees you a spot that lets you bypass the main lot's internal traffic line for a super fast jump onto the road when the game ends, and the walk is literally nothing. it is way cheaper than sitting in a traffic jam for 30 minutes.  
  
the main and official way to go is the ample free parking available on-site at the rmu island sports center. all rmu athletic events offer free parking for fans, and they have a decent amount of space right outside the main entrance of clearview arena, which is super convenient for the short walk. don't bother looking for street parking near the complex- it's on a sports center property, so it's not a real option like it is in the city.  
  
the biggest tip i can give if you go with the free on-site lot is all about timing and that island bottleneck. for a 7:00 pm puck drop, honestly aim to be on neville island by 6:15 pm. being early lets you snag a close free spot and miss the main traffic wave coming over the bridge. if you park in the main free lots, remember that getting off neville island right after the final horn can be a slow crawl. your best problem avoidance move is to hang out at the icehouse bistro for a bit and let the initial wave of cars clear out instead of sitting in the exit line. they have coffee and pub fare there, so it's a good place to wait.  
  
hope this helps you catch a great win against the crusaders!",1,1768558524.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1qecaeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MrEricCartman/comments/1qecaeo/on_tea/,On tea,"I used to be heavily into tea. This was before prices skyrocketed for the higher quality varieties like Silver Needle white tea or Japanese Gyokuro. I would order specific tea variants directly from their respective countries and provinces. The highest quality teas/estates are found there.

These were my favorite vendors:

If you want the best Japanese green tea available it can be found on o-cha. Gyokuro generally considered the best and sencha a close second.

The best Indian teas, such as Darjeeling, can be found on teaemporium. I usually went for the second or autumn flush varieties, which tasted the best to me. First flush reminds me too much of perfume and I’m not into that when drinking tea.

The best Chinese white and yellow teas can be found on teaspring. I usually stuck with Bai Hao Yin Zhen for Silver Needle, which is considered the best. I would also get Bai Mu Dan considered second only to Silver Needle.

-

Mind you I got into all of this while I was still in the military when it was still very affordable. That’s not the case anymore lol.

I stopped ordering it entirely because of how ridiculous the prices got for the high end varieties. And once you’ve had that level of quality, going to lower end teas kind of sucks ass, which is how I ended up getting into coffee.

On Coffee will be for another time though.

1qec9me,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qec9me/looking_for_advice_for_a_friend_who_just_got_done/,Looking for advice for a friend who just got done being incarcerated,"So one of my friends who recently just got out of a situation and is now sitting in a halfway house trying to rebuild his life shitty job, no license, no car. All that good stuff.

He recently came across some female from online. Now he was in a group on Facebook and she started chatting with him she initiated the interaction.

Now apparently she's acting like she has sympathy for him and pity and It seems like she's okay for why he was incarcerated because maybe she likes the whole bad boy feeling of the situation. 

So now fast forward to what he tells me about the situation. She's willing to hang out with him only if he can figure out the situation. 

Now he never told her that he had thousands of dollars in his pocket from reparations of some sort he never told her that he had a brand new car or a license or anything. He's not exactly selling her a dream he has pretty much let her know some basic things.

Now from what it sounds like is she expects something different.


Now it should be pretty obvious for most people that if you've been locked down for a while that you probably have dealt with a long period of no Intimacy It should almost be expected that you might need some form of intimacy at some point here But that's not the focus of the conversation. 


The whole thing of it is before he could even suggest what could happen or how they could meet and get to know one another and lay down any terms. She has already in her head full of a bunch of terms apparently. 


Basically they have only talked for maybe a week or two and it's already been discussed to meet and hang out and she has already got it in her head that he needs to somehow figure out a way to get to a restaurant possibly in his area and set everything up even if that means taking a bus she is already implied that she has no intentions of using her own transportation that she claims she has to pick him up from his halfway house. 

So that means he has to somehow jump on public transportation or take an Uber to some restaurant in order to meet with this woman and have a conversation. Now that right there already strikes me as odd already seems like some high maintenance high expectations from the jump. 


So I say to him I say well you know. Does she understand that you're trying to rebuild your life? Possibly trying to reconnect in society whether it be with family and just living in a different society than what you remember from before. Because everything's different I'm sure in your mind and he says that he's been pretty clear about this. 

Now he's also on a certain type of like parole probation thing she mentioned something about coming over and smoking with him using cannabis. He's not even allowed to use cannabis currently. He figured she would know this also, she was under the impression that he had some type of halfway studio apartment that was all to himself, which apparently she watches a lot of movies. He never implied any of this either. 

So his intention was to meet up still within a few days But once again the conversation shifted to. I don't want to be around or have to deal with no weirdo type  shit If you want to see me you're going to have to find your own way somewhere and set something up and I will not come to a halfway house and hang around there etc. 


Now if you ask me to me, that sounds like a red flag right there You would think that if someone knew of your situation that they would offer to accommodate you and possibly try to meet in the middle at least and offer to help you. 

You would think that a person would mention a place that they thought sounded interesting and see what you thought of the idea. So you'd be on common ground and maybe it would be something that you like and then maybe offer to at least halfway treat you meet you in the middle knowing that you're trying to rebuild your life, but it doesn't sound like any of this is occurring. It sounds like they have high expectations of someone who is struggling and trying to regroup. 

You know an individual is dealing with a halfway house and you already have judgments and assumptions that are negative of individuals. In said situation, you already have a negative view about people who live in the home that you do not know and you're not even willing to drive to the front door of the place and wait for the man to come out so that you can go have a conversation You choose to make things awkward that seems a little odd to me.

Now the other thing  is the person is not directly saying let's meet up, have a coffee and a conversation see how things go and maybe we can meet up a second time. But also at the same time they're not directly saying that he couldn't meet up with her and get intimate if things go good at the same time. The way he describes is if she is implying that like if he sets everything up and things go good, he could possibly get into her pants the first night. 

No, I don't know to me that sounds like a red flag. Should he abandon ship So he doesn't get taken advantage of with what little he has? Or should he make an attempt to deal with somebody who already has all these stipulations It's almost like they were trying to see what he had to offer already. It was like she's looking to see if he has something better than she has where she is at even though clearly she has a high paying job from what he says and she seems to act broke one reason or another it's always something and I believe he has already provided some type of minimal financial compensation like he has already sent a few dollars through some app to the individual. 

Now I mean I get it It's each person's individual choice if they want to send something to someone or do something for someone.

But I think someone has the wrong expectations from the start and it makes me wonder how many other people they have tried to Play with in the same way not to mention the fact that she had explained to the guy that she was dealing with another person and they were her husband at one point and now she doesn't deal with the person on certain types of levels anymore minimal interaction and they don't receive any intimacy or anything. 

Now don't get me wrong. I'm not going to imply here that my friend couldn't possibly play his hand and make a situation sound better than what it is for himself not trying to imply that a person couldn't be somewhat cocky and slightly manipulative after being behind the walls. 

But I mean it sounds like the other party is definitely playing their hand and their actions are already suspect.",1,1768558402.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

*January 15, 2026*

(Throwaway because bf knows my Reddit username)

My bf (39m) and I (30f) have different work schedules. Most days of the week, bf has to be out of the house by 7am and as a grad student, I am often up late working but try to sleep in so I still get at least 8 hours of sleep. Fortunately my partner and I have separate bedrooms so in theory this should be perfectly manageable, but despite repeatedly asking him not to, he always comes into my room to kiss me and tell me he loves me before he leaves which wakes me up every. time. I have an Oura ring so I am also able to see that this often takes place when I am in “deep sleep” which in addition to lost sleep hours, leaves me incredibly groggy throughout the day.

I know it’s sweet but I’ve suggested if he wants to be cute to please leave a note or a nice text I can wake up to. I remind him not to wake me up in the morning the night before and will even tape notes to my door that say please don’t wake me up and he still does anyway !!!

Otherwise our relationship is great so maybe it’s the sleep deprivation talking, but I’m really feeling at my wit’s end with this. Please help me find some clarity on what to do Reddit.

___

># Consensus:

At first, the votes were split between overreacting and not overreacting, with the former telling OOP that they would love to have a partner like this and the latter telling OOP she is justified with being angry at being woken up.

Ultimately, the overwhelming vote was not overreacting.

These comments are wild. Girls out here really begging to be sleep deprived.

Why doesn’t he respect your “no” is my question. When you tell him to stop waking you up, what is his response? Seems really patronizing to me. Get a spray bottle and keep it next to your bed and spritz him repeatedly with it when he wakes you up. Treat him like a misbehaving cat. [GargantuanGreenGoat](https://old.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1qdm08x/aio_if_i_end_my_relationship_because_my_bf_kisses/nzqp57b/)
> Lol, also love this suggestion. When we discuss it, he says he will stop but then keeps doing it.. **[OOP]**
___

Perfect solution: next time he does it, snap open your eyes but make them glow with internal fire and turn into slits, like snake eyes. 

With inhuman speed, grab him by the throat and make your voice very low and demonic and stand up, lifting him up off the floor and pinning him to the wall. 

I FUCKING TOLD YOU TO LET ME SLEEP, you tell him, whilst squeezing harder until he begins to panic and kick his dangling little feet around and make pathetic noises. 

Then you throw him across the room, sending him through the wall and roar. 

This 100% of the time completely solves the issue.  [RemotestOfSpheres](https://old.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1qdm08x/aio_if_i_end_my_relationship_because_my_bf_kisses/nzqpa4j/)

1. Welp this blew up more than I expected but I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I knew the premise was absurd and hyperbolic and I don’t actually want to end my great relationship, which is why I decided (on very little sleep, mind you) to create an anonymous Reddit account to vent my micro-frustrations out to the internet so that my inner molehill mountain gremlin would not leach over into my actual life. I have definitely learned from this experience the ramifications of such decisions and this is the last time I’ll be doing something like this.
2. Some added context to paint a better picture here but the tldr- when my bf came home for lunch we talked it out. He had kept the lights off to be minimally disruptive when making his morning coffee and didn’t see the sign on the door. He forgot I mentioned I would be up late but did kinda remember me asking not wake me up BUT it is our anniversary and for him, it’s about the worry that if something happens to either one of us and that not being the last thing he did. (He’s a complete sweetheart ok I know 😭 +++ points for all the commenters that think I’m an absolute monster!) He promised he would take it more seriously moving forward and I take him at his word for all of it. A big THANK YOU to all of the sincere responses with suggestions because from all of that came to a great solution. He is a wonderful illustrator so I am going to mount a dry erase board on the back of my door for him to easily leave me messages. But after more thought too I’m going to tell him later he can come in and kiss me goodbye and just ask he do it somewhere less sensitive like the top of my head + not whisper directly in my ear.
3. The responses to this post have given me a lot of perspective, as I have also a many times found myself scrolling AIO and AITA posts thinking “may this love never find me”.  All of the comments (of which I’ve only been able to read a fraction) both telling me I should ditch him and those saying he should ditch (or cheat on!) me, have helped me appreciate how little of a window into a person’s relationship these posts really give. Honestly, the relationship I have is truly wonderful. We have fun together every day, work together as a team, and I am so glad this love found me.
4. It’s weird how many of y’all took issue with the separate rooms thing. We still sleep over and hang out in each other’s rooms all the time. But it’s awesome to not be completely beholden to the other persons sleep schedule or compromise closet space? I consider it a privilege lol. Wild.

* Aggregates RSS feeds from news sources you choose
* Monitors specific topics (works like Google Alerts)
* Adds weather and market data if you want
* Delivers everything as a simple text document to your Kindle email
* Completely free, runs on Google Apps Script

**Why Kindle?** Reading news on e-ink is a completely different experience. No notifications, no related articles pulling you down rabbit holes, no infinite scroll. Just read, put it down, done.

I built this during military reserve duty when I needed to stay informed without getting sucked into the attention trap. Now I wake up, my digest is already on my Kindle, and I read it with my coffee. Takes 10-15 minutes, then I'm done with news for the day.

**Setup:** Pretty simple if you have basic tech skills. It's a Google Apps Script (free), you configure which sources and topics you want, and it emails your Kindle daily. Takes maybe 10 minutes to set up.

a few days ago i downloaded bumble, and saw him there. first i swiped left, because i thought that he wouldnt swipe right, but then i saw that i just missed a potential match. so i tried to backtrack, and even paid for it to be able to backtrack (lol)

It was about how Charlton had spent a fortune on a lavish manor and filled it with roses as a gift for his wife on their fifth wedding anniversary.

People called it yet another proof of his unwavering devotion to Beatrice.

There were countless comments, each envious.

""Who says marrying a younger man never ends well? Mr. Fonda is a true romantic. Mrs. Fonda is said to be six years older than him, and he pursued her for three years before they finally got together.""

""Everybody knows how much Mr. Fonda loves his wife. She was trapped in the earthquake two years ago. He rushed back in for her, regardless of his own life, and was badly injured when he was saved. But the first thing he did was comfort his terrified wife. He hugged her and even cried. It was on the news.""

""Last year, a medium mocked Mrs. Fonda for being older and infertile. Mr. Fonda filed a lawsuit and made it bankrupt. In his statement, he said that it didn't matter that they didn't have a child, and that no one would ever be allowed to use it to hurt his wife.""

Beatrice couldn't help but smile bitterly while reading the last comment.

Charlton had kept his promise, shielding her from the world's cruelty, only to break her heart himself.

The moment she confirmed her pregnancy, Beatrice was eager to share the joyous news with Charlton.

But then she received a message from a stranger: a photo of a young, pregnant woman with a sweet smile.

On one knee, Charlton pressed a gentle kiss to her baby bump, his expression filled with happiness and quiet contentment.

Tears ran down Beatrice's face.

She had endured the grueling cycle of IVF six times to reach this point. Now, the diagnosis on the ultrasound report felt like a cruel joke.

The day they got married, Charlton promised he would love Beatrice and no one else for the rest of his life.

Yet that promise held true for just five years.

So, she was done with him.

She wouldn't let her child have a father full of lies.

The door opened.

Charlton walked in and panicked to see Beatrice's red eyes.

""What's the matter, honey? Is something wrong? Don't cry. Whatever it is, I'll fix it for you.""

His eyes landed on the ultrasound report. Without studying it closely, he pulled Beatrice into his arms.

""It's okay that you're not pregnant. We don't have to have a baby. You're all I need.

""Honey, don't cry. Seeing you like this breaks my heart.""

Beatrice forced a smile.

What a hypocrite!

How could he say that when he was expecting a baby with another woman?

Oblivious to her emotion, he continued to soothe her. ""Honey, our anniversary is in a week. I filled the manor with roses for you and arranged a blue fireworks display. I hope you'll like them.

""Blue is your favorite color, right?""

She stared at her with a smile, but tears streamed down her cheeks again.

He didn't remember. Blue was never her favorite.

""I have a present for you, too. You'll receive it in one week.""

His eyes sparkled with happiness.

Carefully wiping the tears of ""joy"" off her face, he said, ""Honey, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to your surprise.""

Beatrice glanced at the ultrasound report quietly.

Hopefully, he'd really like the present she'd prepared for him.

Chapter 2

The next day at noon, Charlton took Beatrice to his parents' for lunch.

His mom, Heidi Fonda, had never liked her. She didn't even attend their wedding.

Afterward, they moved out and only came back at the end of every month.

""Honey, whatever my mom says later, don't take it to heart. I'm always on your side. We leave as soon as we finish lunch,"" Charlton said, holding her hand.

In the doorway, Beatrice heard Heidi laugh, ""The baby is cute. Look at its tiny hands and feet. I feel like my heart was melting.""

She froze on the spot with a pasty face.

The girl beside Heidi was familiar to her. She was none other than the pregnant woman in the photo Beatrice had received on her phone.

""This is Ursula Lewin, the daughter of a dear friend.

""She's pregnant. Her parents are abroad. They asked me to look after her. I went to the hospital with her for a prenatal examination this morning,"" Heidi remarked.

Holding Ursula's hand, she walked over and handed Charlton the ultrasound image with a meaningful look.

""Have a look. Does the baby take after its parents?""

Charlton was obviously flustered. ""Mom, that's not funny. How shall I know? Ursie and I have never met before."" It sounded more like a warning.

Heidi glanced at Beatrice and dragged Ursula forward. ""Well, it seems an introduction is in order. Ursula, this is my son, Charlton. For you, Charlie is fine.""

Blushing, Ursula greeted, ""Charlie.""

Charlton nodded and wrapped his arm around Beatrice's waist. ""This is my wife, Beatrice Hurd.""

""Nice to meet you, Beatrice.""

Beatrice felt like her heart had sunk into an ice cellar. Her hands trembled involuntarily.

It turned out everyone in the Fonda family knew of the existence of Ursula. Only she was in the dark.

""What's wrong?"" Charlton tensed up. ""Is it hypoglycemia again?""

He took out a candy from his pocket, peeled it, and put it to her lips.

Beatrice opened her mouth mechanically.

The candy was supposed to be sweet, but it was pure bitterness that she tasted.

After bidding the houseworkers serve dishes, he took her hand and led her to the table.

""You hardly had anything at breakfast. So, enjoy.""

Beatrice silently picked up a glass of water. Charlton hastened to replace it with warm water.

""You're about to have your period. Cold water will give you cramps.

""The shrimps are good. I'll peel them for you,"" he offered.

During the meal, he barely ate, picking up food for her all the time.

""Charlie is so good to Beatrice. I'm envious,"" commented Ursula out of the blue.

""I also like shrimps. Charlie, will you peel some for me?""

She pushed her plate over. As if not seeing it, Charlton said, ""Do it yourself. I only do it for my wife.""

Beatrice drank some water to repress the surging nausea. ""Give them to her. I don't feel like eating them.""

After a pause, Charlton curled his lower lip childishly and said, ""I'll eat them myself, then. Bea, I peeled them for you. How can you give them to someone else?""

Disdain filled Beatrice's eyes.

He'd slept with that woman. And now, he was pretending he didn't know her.

Scowling, Heidi dropped her fork and said, ""Beatrice, you've failed six times on the IVF, right? I think Ursula can give you some advice about pregnancy.""

""Mrs. Fonda, I'm not experienced. I got pregnant after my first time with my boyfriend."" Ursula shook her head with embarrassment. ""That day was my birthday. I guess it had something to do with my good mood.""

""It makes sense. Beatrice is ten years older than you. How can she compare with you?"" Heidi commented snidely.

""I'm gonna let Ursula move in. This way, I can take better care of her and use her good luck. I want grandchildren.""

""No,"" Charlton objected as soon as she finished speaking.

Heidi's eyes grew colder when she looked at Beatrice. ""What? Someone is barren and can't stand those who are not?""

""Enough!"" Charlton snapped. ""Mom, if you don't want me to come back again, keep talking!""

""Excuse me. I'm afraid I've overstayed my welcome."" Ursula stood up and trotted away with red eyes.

Charlton reflexively took one step forward to catch up to her, but stopped when he realized how inappropriate it was.

""I'm done eating."" Fed up with the farce, Beatrice stood up nonchalantly and left.

At the gate, she received a friend request from Ursula.

""March 5 was my birthday. We did it for the first time that day, and he kept me in bed all day.""

That day, Beatrice tried and failed the IVF for the fifth time.

She locked herself up in her room all day and all night without eating or drinking anything.

When she finally opened the door with a better mood, Charlton was standing there in disheveled clothes. She felt bad for him and even comforted him.

Come to think of it, he'd just come back from having sex with Ursula.

Ugh! Beatrice found herself so ridiculous and pathetic.

For five years, she had to endure the injections, and she had never complained about the pain. But right now, the pang in her heart was unbearable and suffocating.

""Honey, why are you crying?""

Charlton caught up to her. Seeing her tearful face, he panicked and looked at her phone.

Chapter 3

The screen of Beatrice's phone dimmed automatically.

Charlton paid no attention to it.

He pulled her into his arms and patted her on the back. ""Hon, don't cry. I feel awful.

""It's all my fault. I shouldn't have brought you over to put up with this. Although she's my mom, you don't have to humor her because of me.

""Hit me or yell at me as long as it can make you feel better.""

On their way back, Charlton never stopped soothing her.

Beatrice closed her eyes to pretend to sleep.

Notifications of messages came from time to time. He spent the second half of the ride replying to them.

When the car reached the gate to their home, he rubbed the top of her head and said, ""Honey, something urgent came up at the company. I have to go. Wait for me at home. I'll come back as soon as possible tonight, OK?""

Beatrice got out silently.

After he left, she accepted Ursula's friend request.

Then she saw two pictures.

The first one was a back photo of Charlton growing roses.

The second one was a picture of a stretch of blue roses, which was captioned, ""Since you've grown my favorite blue roses, I'll forgive you and wait for you to mollify me.""

Beatrice felt a congestion in her chest.

It turned out blue was Ursula's favorite.

Even the roses were not for her.

Beatrice hailed a cab and went to the manor immediately.

Sure enough, Charlton's black Bentley was parked there.

Not far away, before the roses, Charlton stood with his back to Beatrice, oblivious to her arrival.

""I approached you in the first place only because Beatrice is infertile. She's my bottom line. You showed up before her and are throwing a tantrum?""

Tearfully, Ursula said, ""Then, why are you here? Leave me alone.""

""Don't cry."" Charlton's tone softened. ""As long as you behave, I'll never leave you alone.""

Smiling, Ursula threw herself into his arms.

""I'll do anything, as long as you want it.""

""I cleared my schedule for this afternoon. You tell me whether I want it,"" he said in a husky voice.

He picked her up and walked eagerly toward the house.

Ursula looked back and gave Beatrice a provocative smile. She'd seen Beatrice as soon as she arrived.

Two cuddling silhouettes cast upon the window, swaying.

Beatrice watched on the roadside like a masochist. Even her breath felt cold.

As if yanked by a hook, her heart ached every time it beat, leaving a streak of blood.

""Are you a visitor as well? After so many years, Mr. and Mrs. Fonda are still in love. How touching,"" a woman smiled while taking pictures.

""How lucky Mrs. Fonda is! Mr. Fonda is every woman's dream.""

Beatrice laughed so hard that tears came out of her eyes.

""She's leaving him.""

Charlton bought her a manor and claimed she was his one and only. But right now, right in front of her, he was banging another woman.

The woman peered at Beatrice and was dumbstruck.

No wonder she was mistaken.

Ursula looked a lot like Beatrice when she was 24, the year she met Charlton.

""Men are all pigs,"" the woman commented, thoughtful and dejected.

""Mr. Fonda is better than other men. Perhaps he just wants a child too much. Even his mistress looks like you.

""Why don't you let it go and pretend you don't know? You have to move on. You two are married.""

""This is different,"" Beatrice said in a low voice.

The resemblance between her and Charlton's mistress wouldn't make her grateful. It aggravated her nausea.

After leaving the garden, she fetched the pre-abortion medication from the hospital and went home.

She put the medicine on the coffee table and stared at it, absent-minded and awash with sadness.

The door suddenly opened. Charlton rushed in, the top two buttons of his shirt misbuttoned. Staggering, he knocked over a chair.

He looked her up and down with a pale face and asked, ""Honey, why did you go to the hospital?""

Chapter 4

Beatrice's patient ID card was bound to Charlton's phone number. That was how he knew she'd seen a doctor and was prescribed medication.

""Honey, come on. Tell me. It's killing me.""

Beatrice handed him the bag of medicine.

""The doctor suggests I try a different kind of medicine. It may enhance the possibility of success.""

""I'm relieved that you're fine. What a scare!""

He put the bag back on the coffee table without looking at it.

Beatrice sneered.

He used to read the instructions for any medication she took, in case there was a side effect.

He couldn't undergo the pain in her stead, but he must always remember that she was suffering for him. That was what he was always saying.

But right now, she handed the pre-abortion medication to him, and he wouldn't even look at it.

First of all, happy Friday to everyone. 

Honestly… I missed this feeling so much. Almost 2 weeks without Prodigal felt like actual torture for me 😩😍.

How do I even describe the taste?

Incredibly pleasant acidity, very clean, with a light sweetness at the finish. And this coffee is only 11 days off roast 😍😍😩.

Finally, after waiting, I got to try a washed Kenyan from my favorite roastery.

I truly have no words left to describe how legendary this coffee is.

Let me just enjoy these insanely smooth, delicate sips 😍❤️‍🔥🇺🇸.

After losing a chunk of my deposit to a scratched doorframe (and stressing over fitting a solid oak sofa into the back of an AnyVan), I completely changed how I buy furniture.

We all want that heavy, proper furniture look, but if you move frequently (about every two years), moving them conveniently matters more.

Here are small tips on choosing furniture for ur new move:  

**The ""No Pivot"" Rule (the cabinet):**

I’ve literally been Ross screaming ""Pivot!"" in a stairwell. My old one was a massive solid oak sideboard. Nightmare! so I switched to a modular cabinet from Hulalahome. It’s a system of different functional blocks, like drawers and open shelf, that stack together but travel separately. On moving day, we didn't have to shout ""pivot"" around tight corners; we just carried the individual cubes into the van. Plus, I can rearrange them like building blocks to fit different rooms or needs, like tv stands or night stands.

**Small Footprint Chairs:**

Instead of a giant armchair that dominates the room, I went for a compact leather swivel chair from Baker and StoneHouse. It tucks into tight corners easily. The leather holds up better than fabric when it gets tossed in the back of a truck, and the swivel is actually useful for turning towards the TV or window without dragging the legs across the floor.

**No ""Glass"":**

This is a hard lesson I learned after a coffee table shattered in transit. Avoid heavy glass tops if you rent. They are incredibly heavy to lift and often don't survive the van ride. Stick to wood, metal, or composites that can take a bump without breaking your heart (or your back).

My gf (F31) and i (M32) are in a weird situation.

I try to make it short and give only the necessary backstory.  
Recently the relationship hasnt been good.

A few weeks ago she came home in the evening and told me she was on a stroll with a woman out of the friendgroup she just went to a brunch with and kind of told me she had a butterfly like feeling with her.  
I told her im grateful that she told me but im not mad or anything. Its not something she intentionally did. Nothing happend and therefore theres no reason to be mad even though it still hurts.  
  
We didnt have a good time recently. Both dealing with depression and beeing in therapy.  
We only spend time together in the evening and didnt go out for a while. She often with friends or doing sports so im usually waiting at home for her.  
So i told her i want to do ""quality time"" stuff with her again and she answered that shes not sure if feelings for me will come back, physically and emotionally.   
I said, well i offer you the option to spend time with me and its up to her to accept it.  
(therapist and i discussed that i can only offer if i want it to change).  
  
A few days later we met for a coffee to talk about stuff and i told her that i always feel alot of tension all the time. Tension that build because i tend to avoid stuff that causes arguments. Example would be going out with friends because i either update her to less or shes worried theres other woman or that i spend time with other people and not with her.I feel like walking on eggshells most of the time.  
  
She said she dont want to lose me out of her life but i kind of thing she doesnt want to lose me caring for her(i do the household work and food 90% of the time). I feel like she prefers to spend time with her friends over time with me, because ""we only spend time together in the evening"" after she comes home from meeting friends.

Now after that coffeedate there was no conclusion. i brought her home to her place and we kind of steped away from each other to have some kind of ""break"" while still texting. Plus she has a very  stressfull time with work and is working alot.

thats like 1,5 weeks now, she still working, were still texting, it gets less. I told her i want to go eat and have a good time when shes done or if shes available and is interested. She kind of said yes but no spefic time or date. She still went to see friends on some days during that period. this weekend shes going to meet the friendgroup of her with the woman she liked in it. another friend of her is comming for a visit.

Were ot meeting yet.

Now i tend to think, sure she needs stress compensation whatever but i feel angry at the fact that she said she doesnt know if feelings come back+she liked someone else+ me offering time+ she spending time with others+her telling me she doesnt want to lose me.

Im just confused, i dont know whats wrong and right.",2,1768556604.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1qebn05,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturnestUsers/comments/1qebn05/winter_camping_checklist_what_actually_matters/,Winter Camping Checklist – What Actually Matters When Temps Drop ❄️,"Cold-weather camping isn’t for everyone—but for those who do it, you know how rewarding it can be. Fewer crowds, quiet forests, and that crisp winter air just hit different. That said, winter doesn’t forgive bad prep.

Here’s a no-BS winter camping checklist based on what we’ve learned (and occasionally learned the hard way).

1. Check the Weather (Then Check It Again)

Winter conditions change fast. A solid forecast can save you from a miserable—or dangerous—trip. Make sure you know:

Overnight lows (not just daytime temps)

Wind speeds

Snowfall and road conditions

Bonus tip: many weather apps don’t work well offline, so plan accordingly.

2. Insulation Is More Important Than You Think

Staying warm at night is the biggest challenge.

Cold-rated sleeping bag (rated below expected temps)

Insulated sleeping pad (ground cold is real)

Extra blanket or liner if you sleep cold

If you wake up cold at 3am, the trip instantly goes downhill.

3. Hot Food = High Morale

A reliable stove is a winter game changer.

Stove that performs well in cold temps

High-calorie meals and snacks

Hot drinks (coffee, tea, soup = instant comfort)

Pro tip: a bottle of hot water before bed works surprisingly well.

4. Traction, Tools & “Just in Case” Gear

Snow and ice will test your setup.

Traction boards or tire chains

Shovel or brush

First aid kit

Multi-tool or knife

Power bank

Winter is not the time to skip the basics.

Winter camping doesn’t have to be extreme—but it does require respect for the conditions. Prepare well, stay flexible, and know when to call it if things turn.

1qebmjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1qebmjm/is_there_an_efficient_way_to_simulate_your/,"Is there an efficient way to simulate your support/trainee inventories for comparison outside of the game itself, or is the secret just a pot of coffee and a keyboard?","I've been really enjoying the gameplay loop, just trying out different things for the hell of it and farming those little dopamine hits of ""That was pretty good, but what if I...?"". I bumbled my way into Group B bronze last CM and wasn't really planning on taking the upcoming one too seriously. I'm kind of at that stage where reaching TT A rank has lost the magic and building quality racers and legacy families is more exciting than a high score, but not quite at the point where I'm trying to keep up with the meta.

But February's CM *has* caught my interest, there's plenty of time to research and experiment and YouTube creators have been brainstorming strategies as background noise lately.  My husband's not an anime or gacha fan by any stretch of the imagination, but he's a former competitive MtG guy who realized it was getting to be more stress than fun and decided he'd rather go collector/casual when Star Wars Unlimited turned out to be a breath of fresh air. He walked through the room as I was watching a video about potential strategies for next month and immediately locked in, but shrugged off installing the game since he'd rather build actual decks for his weekend LGS games with his free time. He still kept asking about the game mechanics though so I showed him the Game8 rundown for Sagittarius and offered to let him basically treat it like a buddy trade binder draft with my account. Whatever he can bash together with raw deckbuilding intuition I'll play through and enter for fun. 

The problem is navigating the cards through the unfamiliar menu. I'm a low spender that's been playing a lot of hours over just a couple months and don't have a massive collection, but it's still inefficient af to compare everything click by click for someone unfamiliar with the UI who mostly just wants to see the main bonuses and skill lists of each card fast. I've looked around for an export list utility and struck out, I *can* just bash out some quick and dirty summary proxies of the top 50% of my support cards by hand after my daughter goes to school if it's the only way to get things visually side by side, but I feel like I've seen people mention an online deckbuilding tool or a card comparison site before. If someone would be kind enough to point the way to anything they think would be helpful here, it'd be greatly appreciated. Typing a list of available names and letting him generate them somewhere online to see how they interact would be way, way easier than printing and cutting a whole ass proxy Tracen Academy. 

I'd buy so much cardboard crack if Cygames made a proper Pretty Derby TTG though. I'm already wishlisting figures for Valentine's Day, but just imagine the playmate and card sleeves and deck boxes. So much potential. 

Thank you if you got this far though, I'm long-winded and I know it so I'll highlight here that ***Any ideas for laying out my card inventory for a non-player who enjoys deck building challenges are very, very appreciated. I thought it was a fun suggestion to get my cardboard crackhead husband to try the game and now I have no idea how to achieve it.*** Apparently he thought it was just a dating sim with races until earlier today, and I'd really like to let him experience how delightfully complex the strategy side actually is (despite looking more like a hand than a deck) without getting frustrated by the mobile interface. 

Maybe it'll even win him over and increase my chances of opening an uma statue for Valentine's Day instead of chocolate. It's a long shot, but I'll take it anyway!

We could have been something special.,"I've grown a lot. I've come a long way from the beginning when I would do mental gymnastics to justify emotional abuse. It's almost 6 months since one of the most brutal discards. I know she's a horrible person.. but today would have been the anniversary of our first date. The beginning of the relationship was magical. Most of it actually. There was a lot of chaos still, but I was really on top of the world.

We went for coffee last year. We weren't an item yet. We would have marked that as our anniversary date if she didn't fly out of state and \*\*\*\* her ex boyfriend. The same guy she cheated on me with while we were in Hawaii. I furnished her new apartment I was about to move into with her. He moved into the same apartment barely a month later. While I was at rock-bottom she was \*\*\*\*ing him on my bed frame. Sitting in my chairs and eating dinner off of my grandmother's china.

They got engaged within 2 months of her discarding me. Today got to me because it's the day all of this started. The day she brought havoc into my life. The beginning of the destruction of my 2026. I wish she weren't the callous witch that she is. We really had something special. She called me her twin-flame only to erase me like a one-night stand. We never got into a single fight for 5 months until she became emotionally abusive and trying to hide her infidelity.

On the positive side, I'm doing much better 6 months out. Finally returning to my old self. Singing, laughing. We still have each other followed on Instagram and she's been liking posts about how often she cries. She broke 5 months of No Contact last month by binge watching my Instagram stories the day after Christmas. I don't know if they're still together. Any sane man would run from her. He's not too sane though to fly from out of state and move into an apartment with her after not seeing each other for 5 months.  
  
Apparently he's already dumped her once before. And now she has the baggage of a 5 month whirlwind twin-flame relationship and living in an apartment full of my stuff. It's weird because a large part of me is glad to see that she's not happy. I've redacted a lot of the BS she's put me through so this post isn't too long. Seeing her sad makes me feel better in the sense that karma is doing its work. But a small part of me feels bad for her crying the past month.",1,1768555857.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,3,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1768555833.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

***Friday Night - 11:47 PM***

""Will, did you finish debugging the tax ID issue on the sales invoices?""

Dave leaned back in his chair, his spine crackling as he stretched. The glow of his monitor had been burning into his retinas for the past six hours straight.

""Done. Triple-checked it."" William's eyes never left his screen, scanning thousands of lines of code like a hawk searching for field mice. ""Check GitHub sometime. You're three commits behind.""

""Christ..."" Dave exhaled, checking his watch. ""Doesn't this ever get to you? The late nights, I mean. Especially with a toddler at home.""

""We tag-team it. Emma and I."" William finally glanced up, a flicker of irritation crossing his face. ""And she's not 'a toddler.' Her name is Rose.""

""Right, right. Rose."" Dave spun a miniature figurine on his desk—part of an expensive collection lined up with military precision. ""Guess that's why I stick to hobbies. No one to disappoint but myself.""

""Maybe try disappointing a real person for once—""

William's phone buzzed against the desk. He glanced down as the screen lit up with a cascade of news notifications. The same thumbnail image repeated across multiple headlines—a shaky cellphone frame from Cairo that everyone had seen by now. The American tourist. The gun. The child. Two weeks of wildfire.

His jaw tightened.

""That shit again?"" Dave leaned over, catching the light from William's phone screen.

""A billion views on every platform."" William's voice flattened. ""Rallies in twelve countries. The U.S. just greenlit deportations for anyone with the wrong surname."" He locked his phone and started packing up his desk with methodical precision. ""Whole world's aiming their guns at us now.""

""That's insane."" Dave's voice dipped, something cold creeping into it. ""And Islam has the largest population of any religion. We're not actually heading toward—I mean, it's just one video. One psycho. Governments don't start wars over viral clips.""

William shouldered his bag and headed for the door.

""Governments don't start wars, Dave. People do."" He paused at the threshold without turning around. ""Anyway. See you Monday.""

""Drive safe, man.""

""CHECK THE DAMN GITHUB.""

The door clicked shut.

\---

Rose was asleep when William got home. So was Emma.

He grabbed a beer from the fridge—condensation cold against his palm—and collapsed onto the couch. The leather sighed beneath him. He took a long pull from the bottle, letting the bitterness wash down the day's accumulated weight.

The apartment was silent except for the hum of the refrigerator and the distant wail of a siren blocks away.

He finished the beer. Then another.

When he finally slipped under the covers, Emma stirred.

""You're home,"" she murmured, half-asleep.

""Yeah. Go back to sleep, baby.""

He kissed her temple. She pulled him close, her breath warm against his neck.

Within minutes, they were both asleep.

Outside, the city kept moving. The world kept turning.

\---

***Saturday Morning***

""Dada—up.""

Rose's tiny palms patted William's face in gentle, insistent slaps. His eyes cracked open to find her grinning down at him, backlit by the morning sun.

""Hi, sweetie.""

He lifted her as he sat up, pinching her button nose. She giggled, swatting at his hand.

Across the room, Emma stood at the mirror, running a brush through her golden hair. ""I'm heading out for a bit. Coffee with some of the staff.""

""That's sudden."" William set Rose down carefully and headed toward the bathroom.

""They planned it last minute. Figured I'd just—""

""Guess it's just me and Rose at the theme park, then."" He squeezed toothpaste onto his brush.

""PARK! PARK!"" Rose bounced on her toes, her whole body vibrating with excitement.

Emma froze mid-brush stroke. ""Wait—that's today?""

""Yep."" The word came out muffled through foam.

""No. Absolutely not."" She snatched her phone off the dresser, already dialing. ""I'm not missing this.""

William smiled as he rinsed his mouth, water dripping from his chin.

*That's why I married you. You can't miss the family fun time.*

\---

The theme park was a carnival of noise—children shrieking on spinning rides, vendors hawking overpriced cotton candy, tinny music looping from every speaker.

Rose's eyes went wide at everything. The carousel horses. The balloon animals. The massive foam mascot that terrified and fascinated her in equal measure.

""Dada, look!"" She pointed at a fountain shaped like a dolphin, water arcing from its mouth.

""I see it, baby.""

Emma knelt beside her, steadying Rose as she leaned forward to touch the water. ""Cold, right?""

Rose yanked her hand back, laughing.

They rode the mini train—Rose squealing as it chugged along the rails. They shared a funnel cake that left powdered sugar on all their faces. Emma wiped Rose's cheeks with a napkin while William tried to capture the moment on his phone.

""Get in here,"" William said, waving Emma closer.

She leaned in, Rose perched between them. William stretched his arm out, angling the camera.

*Click*.

Three smiling faces frozen in pixels. Rose with sugar on her nose. Emma's hair caught mid-breeze. William's light blue eyes creased at the corners.

*Perfect*.

He printed them out at a nearby *kiosk* and slipped the photos into his wallet, safe.

\---

***Saturday Evening***

Back home, Rose was already nodding off before they'd even gotten her shoes off.

William tucked her into bed, kissing her forehead. She mumbled something unintelligible and rolled onto her side, clutching the doll that looked like her—last birthday's gift from Emma.

In the living room, he powered up his laptop and plugged in his phone. The photo from the park loaded on screen—bright and full of life.

He dragged it into a folder labeled Family\_2034, then copied the entire folder to his external flash drive.

An old habit. Backup everything. Always.

The progress bar filled. The drive blinked green.

He unplugged it and set it in the desk drawer, years of memories inside.

The TV murmured in the background: ""—US Government responds with war threats following controversial deportation law. Multiple allied nations express shock. Public outrage continues—""

""Stop watching that.""

Emma snatched the remote and clicked the TV off. The screen went dark. ""The world's on fire. I don't need that fire in our house.""

William reached over, gently brushing his fingers through her hair as she settled her head in his lap. ""We're closer to war than we've been in decades. I just—I hope nothing happens.""

""There've been incidents before."" Her voice was soft, almost drowsy under his touch. ""War threats aren't new. They rattle sabers, then everyone backs down.""

""Yeah."" His hand stilled for a moment. ""Let's hope so.""

But the weight in his chest didn't lift. The thought of losing this—this exact moment, Emma warm against him, Rose asleep down the hall, the quiet hum of their life together—made something tighten in his throat.

Their house sat nearly seventy miles from the city by road. Fifty, if you drew a straight line. Silvermont, Nevada—a small town cradled by dense pine forests on three sides and the shimmering edge of Lake Tahoe on the fourth. A tourist trap in summer. A ghost town in winter. Just big enough for a modest theme park and a Main Street with more charm than commerce.

Remote. Peaceful.

*Perfectly safe,* William had thought when choosing the place.

\---

***Monday Morning***

William dropped Emma and Rose off at her office—a small marketing firm tucked between a bakery and a credit union.

""Love you,"" Emma said, leaning through the window. Rose waved from her car seat in the back.

""Love you too."" He kissed her quickly. ""Bye, sweetie.""

""Bye-bye, Dada!""

He watched them disappear through the glass door before pulling back onto the road.

His own office was another fifteen minutes east, a low-slung building shared by three tech startups that could barely afford the rent. He parked in his usual spot—perfectly centered between the lines, as always—and grabbed his bag.

Inside, Dave was already at his desk, headphones on, muttering at his screen.

William booted up his workstation and opened his browser. Email could wait.

He navigated to *MachinistHub*, his favorite forum for hobbyist engineers. New posts since yesterday: a custom lathe build, a debate about carbide versus *HSS* tooling, a miniature steam engine machined from scratch. He skimmed a few threads, admiring the precision work, then clicked over to *PrecisionWorks* Blog for an article about *CNC* router upgrades.

For a few minutes, the world narrowed to feeds and sprockets, aluminum stock and tool paths. Problems with clear solutions. Projects you could hold in your hands.

No wars. No videos. No crowds screaming for blood.

Just metal and science.

He exhaled slowly, feeling the tension in his shoulders ease.

Then his phone buzzed.

A news notification.

*Breaking News. War notice already been—*

He swiped it away without reading the rest.

Not today.

\---

""—so if we patch the validation logic here,"" William tapped the projected screen with his pen, ""the invoice generator won't throw null exceptions when the tax ID field is empty. We add a conditional check at line 347, route it through the error handler, and push a user-facing prompt instead of a silent fail.""

The project manager squinted at the diagram. ""And that won't break the batch processing?""

""No. The batch queue runs separately. This only affects real-time entries."" William pulled up another window, lines of code cascading down the screen. ""The foreach loop iterates through validated records. If validation fails upstream, it never hits the queue.""

""What about legacy data?""

""Migration script. I'll write it this afternoon. Should take an hour."" William minimized the window. ""Any other blockers?""

*Silence*.

""Good. I'll have the pull request ready by end of day.""

The meeting dissolved into handshakes and nods of approval.

\---

***Monday Afternoon***

He left early—4:30 PM, a rare luxury—and swung by Emma's office first.

She slid into the passenger seat with a tired smile, settling Rose on her lap. ""You're my hero.""

""Dada!""

""Rough day?"" He pinched Rose's cheeks gently.

""Client revisions. Third round."" She leaned her head against the window. ""I'm so done.""

""Let's grab dinner on the way. You're not cooking tonight.""

They stopped at a family-owned Italian place and picked up lasagna, garlic bread, and tiramisu. The smell filled the car, rich and warm.

\---

Emma set the table while William flipped on the TV, more out of habit than interest.

*""—Cairo government bans all US citizens, effective immediately. China endorses Russia's Anti-US Global Response Initiative. The viral video continues to fuel—""*

William hurled the remote onto the table. It clattered and nearly fell off the edge.

""Jesus Christ."" He rubbed his face. ""The world needs a sense of humor. Really.""

Emma glanced over from the kitchen. ""Turn it off, Will.""

He did.

""Do you think we should move? Somewhere safe?"" Her voice wavered behind the cutting board noises.

""Move? If a war happened, it would be nuclear. Where do we move to stay safe?""

""Lisa, in the house next to us, already moved—she said it's not safe to stay in the US for the time being."" Emma turned the stove on; the gas valve hissed softly.

""I built a basement not just for decoration."" William glanced toward the basement door. There were two entrances—one inside the house and one outside, facing their swimming pool.

Dinner was quiet in the best way.

Rose smeared marinara sauce across her cheeks, delighted with herself. William wiped her face with a napkin, dabbing gently as she squirmed.

""Hold still, troublemaker.""

""No!"" She giggled, twisting away.

Emma laughed, her exhaustion melting just a little.

After dinner, William cleared the plates while Emma tried to corral Rose toward the bathroom for a bath. Emma groaned, stretching her arms overhead.

""My back is killing me.""

""Go sit."" William nodded toward the couch. ""I've got this.""

""You sure?""

""Go.""

She didn't argue. He watched her shuffle toward the living room, then bent to lift her by the waist, spinning her gently onto the couch cushions.

""Will!"" She laughed, swatting at him.

""Rest. Doctor's orders.""

He returned to the sink, warm water running over his hands as he scrubbed the dishes. Behind him, he could hear Emma settling in, Rose's bathtime giggles echoing from down the hall.

This. This was enough.

Later, they sat together on the couch, Rose finally asleep.

""I have a day off tomorrow,"" William said, raising his coffee mug. ""Switched schedules with Dave. He begged for it.""

""Then I'll drive tomorrow."" Emma sighed. ""I need to get in early. Those endless revisions.""

""Let's sleep early then. You'll need it.""

She nodded, already closing her eyes against his shoulder.

\---

***Tuesday Morning***

By the time William woke up, Emma had already left. Breakfast was still steaming on the table—scrambled eggs, toast, and a note that said \*Love you both\*.

He smiled and went to prepare Rose's breakfast.

""Just you and me today, sweetie.""

He turned on the TV to find her a cartoon show while spoon-feeding her cereal.

Rose accidentally clicked the remote and switched the channel.

""—*Tensions escalating. Credible nuclear threats issued to all allied nations. North Korea vows to respond*—""

William's hand shot out, silencing the TV with a decisive click.

He turned back to Rose, who sat in her high chair chewing cereal with intense focus.

""Good girl."" He wiped a dribble of milk from her chin with his thumb.

She grinned up at him, gap-toothed and perfect.

""Wait here, Rosie. I'll put this in the sink.""

He kissed her forehead—soft and warm—and stood.

The world felt strange for a moment. Disconnected. Like a splice in a film reel.

Then his phone rang.

Video call. Emma.

He answered, angling the screen toward Rose. ""Hi, honey. Look, Rosie's playing with her doll again.""

""Mommy!"" Rose's little hands reached out, trying to touch the screen, fingers splayed against the glass.

Emma's face filled the frame, smiling but tired. ""Be good, sweetie. I'll be back by six today. Love you so much. Both of you."" She pressed a kiss to the camera.

Her expression shifted—just slightly. Something heavier slipping into her eyes.

""Take care of her, Will.""

""I will,"" he said.

The call ended.

The screen went dark.

William stared at it for a beat longer than he meant to.

Then Rose banged her doll on the tray, snapping him back.

""Play!"" she demanded.

He smiled. ""Okay, baby. Let's have fun today.""

Later, he saved the video call recording and transferred it to his flash drive, slipping the drive into his pocket.

\---

***Tuesday Afternoon - 2:47 PM***

William was cleaning the light fixture with a broom that afternoon, standing on a stepladder in the living room.

""Dada... lift."" Rose's small hand stretched toward him from below, her other hand still gripping her doll's leg.

""You want a lift?""

She nodded excitedly, her whole face lighting up.

""Here comes the lift... Whooo!"" William tossed her gently into the air. Rose giggled, her laughter bright and pure, echoing in the sunlit room.

Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted.

The wind stopped. Total, absolute silence descended for a split second.

Then the birds screamed. Dogs began barking in a terrified chorus from every direction.

Something was wrong.

William turned as a silent, searing white light bleached the room, erasing the shadows from the walls. In the distance—far beyond the treeline, somewhere over the city—a massive, blinding light was building. A shape was beginning to rise. A mushroom blooming into the sky.

His breath caught.

*No*.

He ran.

Hoisting Rose against his chest with his left arm, he sprinted toward the backyard. His mind screamed at him—*water, cover,* *shield*—and his right hand grabbed the large metal washbasin they used for bathing Rose.

He kicked a large pot nearby and jumped into the pool. The water turned murky in an instant.

The cold shocked his system, but he didn't stop. He pulled Rose tight against his chest with his left arm, her face pressed into his shoulder, her doll clutched in her tiny fist. With his right hand, he slammed the metal basin upside down over their heads, trapping an air pocket inside.

He dragged them down to the bottom corner of the pool, pressing against the pool wall. The basin fought him, buoyant and desperate to surface. He hooked his legs around the potted tree at the bottom, muscles burning as he forced the basin down. Rose was panicking—confused, terrified—but his hands were busy. He balanced her on his thighs, keeping her head in the air pocket while wrestling the basin into place.

His lungs screamed. His arms shook.

*Just hold on. Just hold*—

The blast hit.

A colossal, earth-shattering ROAR tore the world apart. The shockwave swept over the water, churning it violently. William felt the pressure slam into them even through the pool—the basin rattling like it would tear apart, the water surface boiling with heat and force. The vibration traveled through his bones, his teeth chattering uncontrollably.

He couldn't breathe. Didn't dare try.

Rose was crying—he could feel her small body shaking against him—but he couldn't hear her over the roar.

Debris rained down above—wood, glass, metal—muffled thuds splashing against the water's surface.

The heat came next. Even underwater, he could feel it. A wave of searing air trying to cook everything it touched.

William's vision blurred. Black spots crept in at the edges. His chest felt like it would collapse.

*Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't—*

He pressed Rose's face tighter into his chest, shielding her from everything he could.

In the chaos, only one sentence repeated in William's mind, over and over:

*Take care of her, Will.*",1,1768555403.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

The moment I nudged the door open, there was Elliott’s flustered secretary, practically swallowed by the space under his desk.

The girl was clearly caught red-handed, and he was desperately trying to keep his cool.

Eyes straight ahead, I placed the document on his desk.

""Payment request for the Westfield project. Sign it, please.""

He swallowed a smirk, grabbed the pen, and scribbled his signature across a few pages without even glancing.

Finally, he lifted his dazed gaze. ""Wait, I thought your flight wasn't until tomorrow? What’s got you back so soon?""

I scooped up the signed papers. ""Had some urgent business to wrap up.""

Before I could bail, I cast a glance under the desk. ""You should probably let her out now.""

He visibly stiffened.

He probably expected a full-blown scene, like last time—demands, accusations, maybe even a viral video.

But I just added, calm as you please, ""Her legs are gonna go numb down there.""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""So, what urgent business brought you back?""

I didn't answer. I just closed the door and, with deliberate care, hung the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the handle.

Little did he know, my ""urgent business"" was already handled.

......

From the other side of the door, Megan’s breathy, overly sweet whine reached me.

""Mr. Morgan, you nearly gave me a heart attack just now.""

Elliott let out a low chuckle, his voice rough with recent exertion. ""Scared of what? She wasn't going to eat you.""

""But she's your wife...""

""Exactly! Which is why she’s sensible. See? She left on her own.""

I stood in the hallway, the harsh fluorescent light striping the floor at my feet.

Megan’s voice dripped with syrupy insinuation. ""So... are you coming home tonight?""

""Playing around is one thing,"" Elliott said, his tone utterly casual, ""but home is home.""

Megan giggled.

""Mr. Morgan, you're just so used to being pampered. Can't go a day without it, can you?""

""I can do everything she does! Wasn't I good enough for you just now?""

""You and she are different,"" he drawled. ""She's stubborn as a mule, but she can't live without me!""

""You know how she cut ties with her family to marry me.""

""If I don't go home, you little playthings out here don't stand a chance.""

He tossed off a mention of that painful history like it was just pillow talk.

Megan's voice turned cloying.

""So... do you like that about her? All tough on the outside, but a total softie underneath?""

A beat of silence.

Then, I heard Elliott’s quiet, amused laugh. ""What do you think?""

""I think—""

Megan never finished the sentence.

Because I pushed the door open again.

They both froze.

Megan was perched on the edge of Elliott's desk, mid-way to sitting. Elliott was slouched in his chair, his shirt unbuttoned at the collar.

He blinked, stunned for a second, then raised an eyebrow. ""Forget something?""

Chapter 2 - The Scent of Betrayal

I walked in, heading straight for the coffee table. My car keys were still there.

I grabbed them and turned to leave.

""Rosalie,"" Elliott stood, a shadow detaching from his desk and moving towards me.

His arms snaked around my waist. This was so typical of him at the office, always so liberal with his affections when he thought no one was looking.

I gently wriggled free.

He still carried the distinct scent of another woman's perfume, the same one I had on my vanity. He'd gifted it to me last month, calling it ""one of a kind,"" totally me. Now I realized he'd probably bought it in bulk, like five bottles.

""I'll be home for dinner tonight,"" his voice dripped with its usual honeyed tone. ""What do you want? I'll cook, okay?""

Beside him, Megan let out a tiny, almost inaudible snort.

""Don't bother,"" I said, my voice flat. ""I have plans.""

His smile faltered, but the corners of his mouth still curved upwards. ""What's wrong? Are you upset?"" He leaned in, whispering, ""Because of Megan? I told you, she's just a—""

""I know,"" I cut him off softly. ""She's an intern secretary who needs your hands-on guidance."" What kind of ""guidance"" he provided was really his business.

He froze for a beat. He probably didn't expect me to be so chill, no drama, not even a hint of sarcasm.

He reached out to touch my face, but I'd already stepped back.

""Alright,"" he shrugged, his hand instead closing on my arm. ""Whatever it is, be home by nine.""

Megan giggled next to him. I caught her eye. She held my gaze, unlike the other women I'd dealt with. She’d been too sheltered. Her eyes were full of unapologetic triumph and a dare.

Youth. It's a whole mood.

Looking at her bright, unblemished face, I was suddenly transported back to that summer when I was twenty. Elliott had held me close then, just before we made our escape from the sanatorium. It was the third day my father had committed me for ""treatment""—treatment for my ""obsessive love,"" my ""illness"" of insisting on being with a poor boy.

Elliott had waited all night in the ventilation shaft. As the orderlies changed shifts at dawn, he'd pried open my window. ""Jump!"" he'd urged, arms outstretched below.

I closed my eyes and jumped. He caught me, taking the brunt of the fall himself, his elbow bone cracking but his grip never loosening. Once we were clear, he slumped against the wall, his shirt soaked with sweat. He grabbed my hand, pressing it to his chest. His heart hammered against my palm.

""Rosalie,"" his eyes were alarmingly red. ""Listen to me. If I can get you out of here today, no one will ever separate us again."" He fumbled in his pocket, pulling out a thin silver ring, a cheap find from a flea market. He'd clumsily etched an ""R"" inside. His fingers trembled as he slid it onto my finger. ""Someday, when I have money, I'll get you the biggest diamond ring."" His voice cracked, thinking of how wronged I must have felt.

The sun that day was just like this, blazing on his young face, igniting the light in his eyes. I believed it was forever.

...

Back in my office, my assistant knocked and entered. ""Ms. Campbell, here's the summary of the specially approved accounts from your business trip this week."" She placed a tablet in front of me. ""Among them… Ms. Rice's expense records need your review.""

I scrolled through the screen. Italian custom lingerie, exclusive spa treatments, Ritz-Carlton suites… My finger stopped on the last entry: Private maternity clinic medical consultation…

My assistant added, her voice cautious, ""Finance said… all these expenses were processed under 'employee benefits,' with Mr. Morgan's special authorization.""

I set down my coffee cup. ""How long has Megan Rice been employed?""

""Three months.""",1,1768555195.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Poverty can be just as devastating as shelling.

\* If you live in the countryside, you have a major advantage over those in cities.

\* If you can, start producing your own food. Food has no price during war.

\* Learn how to obtain and store firewood for heating. Have some tools for that (don't assume you will have fuel for a chainsaw)

\* Learn how to make jams and preserves from fruit and wild berries (keep in mind this requires a lot of sugar).

\* Stock up on lighters, flints, and fuel (or simply buy packs of BIC lighters).

\* Assume you will not have electricity.

\* I didn’t have them back then, but today solar chargers and batteries are widely available, store them.

\* Have rechargeable lamps and flashlights.

\* Gold was worth nothing during the war.

\* If you have money, you may be able to buy food, but it will cost 50 \\\~ 100 times more than today.

\* Salt is cheap, store at least 10 kilograms.

\* Build up honey reserves.

\* Stock edible cooking oil.

\* A bicycle is irreplaceable (make sure you have spare parts also).

\* Have water canisters.

\* Own practical, durable clothing.

\* Have a radio.

\* If you have coffee, someone will always buy it.

\* No matter how much canned food you have, it will never feel like enough.

\* Have some skill (for example know how to repair a chainsaw, bike)

1qebbqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qebbqz/mariachi_band_update/,Mariachi Band Update,"I posted this update in my comments but it went unviewed 😭

UPDATE:

A few days ago, I posted about hiring a mariachi band to follow my next-door neighbour because he kept mowing his lawn at 6 a.m. Reactions were mixed, but at the time I felt justified and honestly thought it might finally get the point across.

That did not happen!

Day 3, the neighbour decided to get back at me. Instead of mowing, he started what he called “engine maintenance” at 5:45 a.m. The mower wasn’t on the grass. It was just running. Loudly. Revving over and over like it was angry about something. 

On Day 4, things got a whole lot worse.

Overnight, the neighbour put up wind chimes all along the fence between our houses. These are not gentle, decorative chimes. These are huge, metal things that clang together every time the slightest breeze hits. The noise is unreal, I swear I feel it in my teeth.

I’ll admit I didn’t handle this well. I asked the mariachi band, who are now weirdly invested in this feud, to add long pauses and then a single trumpet note whenever the neighbour came outside. Other neighbours started filming, and it felt like the whole street was watching a surreal suburban war unfold.

Yesterday, the council showed up after several noise complaints. Some were about the neighbour. Some were about me. One neighbour apparently described it as “musical harassment.” We were both told to stop and given informal warnings. The band has been stood down, and the neighbour stopped mowing early.

Then.....this morning happened.

At exactly 6 a.m., the neighbour didn’t mow. Instead, he stood in his garden drinking coffee, staring directly at my house, while playing bagpipe music on a Bluetooth speaker. The wind chimes were still going. The combined sound was almost physical. I could feel it in my chest, in my teeth, in my very bones. No words were exchanged. Just bagpipes, chimes, and intense eye contact.

Now, I keep thinking about retaliation. I’m not talking about noise, I want something quiet but unhinged, specifically targeted at the neighbour. I’ve considered sitting in my garden at odd times, holding a mug and staring off into the distance. Placing a single chair facing his house and sitting for ten minutes at exactly the same time every day. Writing vague updates like “STILL WATCHING” on a whiteboard pointed at his house. Slowly rearranging stones or measuring fence panels over and over, pretending it’s important. Even installing a doorbell on the fence, connected to nothing, just for the unsettling effect.

I haven't done any of this....YET!

Five minutes into the date, I realised… the chemistry had stayed online.

He barely made eye contact, laughed at his own jokes before finishing them, and kept asking me things I’d already told him on chat. The silences were LOUD. At one point, we both just sipped our coffee and nodded like strangers waiting for a bus.

Nothing bad happened. He was polite. Just… awkward in a way you can’t fix with emojis.

Nevertheless, I followed all the instructions : Boiled Water in the base - below the safety valve, Not tamping the Coffee too much, Brewing in lowest possible heat and finally putting the Moka Pot in a vessel filled with cold water so as to prevent over-extraction.

Probably, the coffee tastes bitter because I'm mostly used to BT's Easy Pour's which have 11g Coffee and on the other hand, this Moka Pot consumes 25-30g Coffee in one go, sorta very strong even when I split it with a Coffee partner. Nevertheless, I'm gonna try out BT's Amaltas Blend next with some Aeropress filters on top of the Coffee to make the outcome more clean.

I began my career as a cognitive behavioral therapist, fresh out of UGA with a six-year Master's in psychology. Put simply, my job was to help individuals break unhealthy thought and behavior patterns and teach them healthier, approved coping mechanisms.

One of the methods I would use to break cycles of negative thought patterns is called affirmations. If you have ever heard of “manifesting,” then you probably already have a decent understanding of affirmations, as the process is basically the same. Instead of negative thoughts, like “I am a failure, and I'll never finish this story,” I taught people to think positive thoughts, like “I can grow from this, I will continue writing one paragraph at a time.” For most individuals, introducing these positive thought patterns was a benefited their lives, and resulted in higher overall mood and self-esteem.

Key word: Most.

For a few, the affirmations became borderline narcissistic in nature and unreasonable; beyond the scope of what any person could actually accomplish with just positive thoughts, and some affirmations that seemingly transcended possibility altogether. They would share their affirmations with me in our scheduled sessions, and where most people would have mantras on the level of “I am an okay person, and nobody actually hates me,” these patients’ mantras would be more similar to “I will be the greatest there ever was at ‘X’ sport,” or “I will get promoted to CEO at work.” 

While I did not encourage these thought patterns, I also did not discourage them as much as I should have, in hindsight. So what if they never became the best baseball player ever, or still got passed up for promotions at work? It still gave them a goal to work towards. Overly positive thoughts are still better than negative thoughts, right?

Wrong.

— 

It all started with Jeanine. Jeanine was a twenty-something novelist hopeful with seven unpublished novels sitting dormant on her laptop's hard drive. She came in one day and, after our usual banter and debrief of the previous couple of weeks, she shared her new affirmations with me.

“I will get a book published.” She said, a somewhat reasonable goal. “I will be successful.” A markedly less achievable goal. “The book will make a best-seller list in the first month.” A completely absurd endeavor, I thought to myself. 

“Good, Jeanine! Those are some big goals. Have you started the process yet?” I asked, my doubts pushed to the back of my mind, where they would not help my face to betray me.

“No! But like you've said, I can do anything I put my mind to! And I've been praying my affirmations daily!” She almost shouted, gleefully. 

Praying? That was an unusual way to put it, but not so unusual at the time to warrant questioning her. She had said in a previous session that she was religious, after all.

“Good! Now set a realistic timeline for yourself so you stay on track!” I oozed, attempting to both mirror and temper her enthusiasm in the same sentence.

“Hmm, how does two months sound?” She beamed. Two months to write a novel seemed wild to me, but two months to write, get published, and top a chart? Insanity.

“Are you sure you don't want to make this a more long-term goal, Jeanine?” I spoke as if I were trying to defuse a bomb with my words, afraid that too much negativity would cause a regression.

“No, I'm pretty confident! I plan to start writing today!” She said, her smile only growing wider, and as soon as the final syllable left her lips, the little egg timer I used to keep to a standard one-hour session chimed. “See you in a couple of weeks!”

She was gone before I could say another word. 

In her next session, she mentioned that she had experienced a sudden burst of inspiration and was almost completely through writing a new novel. In the following session, the novel was completed, and she spoke of multiple publishers getting back to her, interested not only in the novel she had submitted, but also in anything else that had come of her “genius” mind. 

She did not come to the session after that one; instead, she sent me a signed copy of her book. The cover art was a dark silhouette of a person from the shoulder up, with thin white streaks branching out from it. At the bottom left corner, a bright golden seal gleamed up at me. 

Best Seller, Georgia Times.

I was given a bold, praising mention on the very first page of the book with lettering:
“Special thanks to Dr. Edmund, none of this would have been possible without your positive guidance!” 

It shouldn’t have been possible, even with my guidance. 

The name of my practice and my business phone number were also mentioned, followed by the tagline “Call for a miracle!”

I was no doctor, but even so, the calls came in. Within a week, every open time-slot was filled, and I was working almost every day, around the clock, just to keep up. Nothing changed about the way I practiced my craft, and, for the most part, nothing changed in the lives of those who sought my aid.

It only took a few months for the hype to wear off, and my list of clients to dwindle to only slightly-above-average numbers, but, unfortunately, the new clients weren’t the only ones who took notice of Jeanine’s little “miracle.”

—

“Rising local author, Jeanine ____ missing from her Georgia home. Foul play suspected. Please call local law enforcement if you have any information that may lead to …(read more)”

The notification from the news app on my phone made my breath catch in my throat, and my right hand release the spoon that was hanging precariously above my bowl of Frosted Flakes. Before my finger could even obey the thought to tap (read more), three loud knocks rang out from my front door. I was not expecting company.

“Police,” the disembodied voice rang through my house, “we are here to discuss the disappearance of Jeanine _____. We just want to talk.”

I hesitantly stood up and made my way to the door. The frosted glass made determining who lay beyond nigh impossible, and when I tried to take a peek through the peephole, I found it to be covered.

“I was just her therapist, I didn’t really know her personally,” I said, but the voice at the door insisted. I unlocked the door, and as if on cue, it burst inwards, knocking me to the ground. Three men entered my home: two wearing tactical gear and carrying large, heavy-looking black flashlights, and a third wearing a suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.

The two tactically geared men grabbed my arms, clasped my wrists together with handcuffs that seemed too heavy for their size, and led me to my couch. The well-dressed man laid his briefcase out on my coffee table and spoke. “Scan the house. No more uncontained witnesses.” His accent was unreadable, and his tone plain and flat. The men left our presence and began throwing doors open as he turned to me directly.

“Mr. Edmund, I presume?” His words sounded more like a statement than a question. “Call me Mr. H. I'm sure you have an idea of why we're here?”

“Yes… Sir?” I responded timidly, still rubbing at the arm that I’d landed on only moments before. Truthfully, my only hint was what they shouted before kicking my door in, but I still got the hint.

“We understand that you played a part in this woman's sudden rise to fame? Her little miracle?” He slid a photo across the table to me. It was Jeanine, bound and gagged in a dark room, makeup running down her face, and Subject N-94 stamped at the bottom in blocky lettering.

“Hardly, sir. I was just her therapist. I couldn't believe it either when she wrote the entire novel in just a month,” I said truthfully, motioning to the book, which sat closed at the opposite edge of the table from Mr. H.

He gave it only a cursory glance before looking back at me, slight confusion tugging at his brow. Before he had a chance to continue, the two other men returned to the room. 

“Nobody else here, sir.” The first said, holstering his flashlight.

“No abnormal LF readings either, not even a hair above base…” the second started to say, before the small box with an antenna in his hand began to beep slowly, “hang on, I'm getting a reading in here.”

He circled slowly around the living room, pointing the antenna first at me, then to the floor, neither of which produced any measurable difference. Finally, he pointed it at the book on the coffee table.

Beep. Beep. Beep. -KZZZZKT-

The small box emitted a string of beeps, followed by shrill static. The man holding it turned a dial and moved it closer to the book, which resulted in it emitting a noise reminiscent of a choir singing slightly out of key. The man spoke, peering down at a small digital display on the device: “Residual LF readings. Pattern congruent with Subject N-94's signature.”

Mr. H gazed up at the men and nodded, prompting them to unhandcuff me. I rubbed at my wrists where the metal had pressed into them. There was something wrong about that metal, unholy even. This would not be my last run-in with what I would later learn to be called Longinium.

“Very well, Mr. Edmund. I believe you now, you're entirely clueless,” Mr. H said, a slight smirk curling the edges of his lips. I breathed a shaky sigh of relief, and he continued, “But there is still the matter of what to do with you. You know too much. Hell, everyone who read that book knows too much, but they all at least think it's just some torture-porn sci-fi novel.”

“You mean… it isn't?” I asked, my jaw never returning to its natural position. The contents of that book had to be fiction… gods… demons… the Fates… there was no way any of that could be real… right? That must mean…

“You work for H…” I tried to say, but couldn't finish my sentence, as one of the men standing behind me walloped me in the back, knocking the wind out of me. 

Mr H's smirk grew to a grin. “And now you know even more that you shouldn't,” he oozed as he eyed me greedily, “Yet, you may actually be useful to us. Tell me, doctor, what are your methods?”

Fearing the alternative to being found “useful” to Mr. H and his goons, I recounted the events leading up to and following Jeanine’s final session with me. In the beginning, the faces of the other three men remained unreadable. Then I got to the session where she shared her three final affirmations with me. Mr. H's face betrayed fascination when I mentioned her method of affirming her goals.

“Prayer? Who was she praying to? Did she mention a name? A deity? A specific religion, even?” He questioned, and either interest or worry caused his voice to rise an octave higher than the gruff one he had forced previously.

“No, sir, she simply stated that she was praying her affirmations daily,” I relayed, “she mentioned she was religious, but never said which one.”

Mr. H stood, his hands shaking slightly, and spoke his next words slowly and deliberately. “I hope you’re right. Religions are useful, doctor. They bind belief to a greater power, something outside of one's own control. Without that binding… and without the self-limiting factors of doubt and fear, things like her are dangerous.”

“Things like her? What is she?” I asked, my head tilting to the side automatically.

His eyes met mine, and his next word inexplicably evoked a sense of terror I had not felt since childhood.

“Fallen.”

—

For the first year or so, I was not allowed to leave the bunker. I had skills that they found useful, but I was untrusted, unproven, and considered an information leak risk. How ironic that it is only now, after the better half of a decade, that I finally come forward and tell my story. After gaining their trust. If only they’d been honest with me from the start, but who knows? Maybe they didn’t even know the full extent of our meddling.

That was seven years ago. I have come to learn that Mr. H’s terminology is always intentionally vague. I am still not entirely certain what a Fallen is, what exactly differentiates them from baseline humanity, or what they are truly capable of without guide rails in place. In fact, I am left in the dark about most things, despite my until-recently thriving business relationship with Mr. H and his employer. I have, however, seen a glimpse of why they are so dangerous if not contained. First-hand.

My job within the organization was actually quite similar to my job before I was recruited, save a few key factors: 

I was paid by the month, not per client (though the pay was much better than I could ever dream of earning doing individual clients by myself) 
I no longer could choose my clients (which official documentation referred to as conduits, but that term is much too impersonal for my profession); they are chosen for me.
Clients always came in sets of three.
Clients’ affirmations were pre-written by the organization.
Clients stayed with me until their goals were accomplished. I never saw the same individual more than once, either.

The oddest parts of this unusual situation, however, were the affirmations themselves. They weren’t personal, like normal affirmations should be, nor were they designed to benefit the affirmer in any way that I could tell; they often involved major regime changes, large amounts of money passing hands, beginnings and ends of wars, and, one time, the results of a Super Bowl. Additionally, each individual did not present themselves to me with different affirmations; they were always the same. All three clients would be focused on the same outcome of the same event.

It wasn’t until I found the document that my mundane day-to-day began to grow heavy on my conscience. The bundle of papers had seemingly been slipped under my office door while I was away on vacation, and consisted of several lists of previous clients’ affirmations and outcomes of the session. I immediately recognized this document because I, in fact, was the one who created it; however, taped to the back of the spreadsheet was a small, indigo colored flashdrive, with a single word written on it in black marker.

Consequences.

My heart skipped a beat, and I immediately looked around to ensure that I wasn’t being watched. Weary of plugging this serendipitously discovered flash drive into my surely-monitored work terminal, I opted instead to browse it using my personal laptop, disconnected from any source of internet or intranet connection, and housed within a virtual machine, just in case it was viral. My worries about cybersecurity were quickly replaced with a deep dread as line after line of data populated on my screen. The majority of the document remained the same as the paper copy I held in my hands only moments before, except for an additional column.

Counterbalance.

For every seemingly neutral or positive event that had transpired under my direction, tragedy and loss-of-life coincided. 

Affirmation: The Los Angeles Rams Will Win Super Bowl in 2022. Outcome: Successful. Counterbalance: Rising tension in Eastern Europe, leading to an ongoing mass casualty event.

Affirmation: A Major Regime Change in the Middle. East. Outcome: Moderate Success. Counterbalance: Unexplainable hurricane formation over the Atlantic. Mass casualty event.

Affirmation: A Foreign Power will overtake a major US industry. Outcome: Moderate Success. Counterbalance: Sudden earthquakes in Asia, unusual winter weather in the US. Mass casualty event.

The list went on and on, page after page of tragedies, all an indirect result of my work. A counterbalance to my meddling with Fate. I read all the way down to the bottom line, expecting to see my most recent session’s affirmations and results, but I was instead met with an unfinished entry dated for the day I left for vacation.

Affirmation: Mr. Edmund will be met with a terrible fate. Outcome: TBD. Counterbalance: TBD.

What really drew me in is the brand’s philosophy: their nut butters are positioned as a moment to pause, step out of autopilot, and eat more consciously. It feels very food-first, grounded, and aligned with Brighton’s slower, mindful food culture.
* **Moon Juice (USA)** – one of the original mainstream adaptogen brands, still shaping how the category looks and is talked about.
* **Anima Mundi (USA)** – blends herbal traditions with culinary and ceremonial presentation in a really distinctive way.
* **Four Sigmatic (Finland / USA)** – often associated with the rise of mushroom-based beverages and coffee alternatives.
* **Three Spirit (UK)** – a London-based brand incorporating botanicals and adaptogens into non-alcoholic social drinks.

I’d love to hear from this community:

* Are there any **adaptogen or functional food brands** you know or have come across that I haven’t mentioned, especially UK or Europe-based ones?

I don't mean this in a witchy or voodoo-esque way either; I'm not spending my time down in my basement making wax replicas of each of you individually, then sprinkling lime juice on them, or stabbing toothpicks through them while burning sage from a human skull brazier. 

That would be barbaric. No, what I do is clinical. Proven. Far removed from such acts of Paganism, in fact. You see, your prayers don't get answered, because mine do, or rather, those of my investors do… did… and the world will only permit so many little miracles at a time, right?

Wrong. 

Were it so simple, my work would continue, albeit slowly. If probability could be so easily shifted without consequence, perhaps my life would still have a chance to go on. Unfortunately, miracle work is a bit more complicated than that. If only I had known this sooner… I don't know how much longer I have.



I began my career as a cognitive behavioral therapist, fresh out of UGA with a six-year Master's in psychology. Put simply, my job was to help individuals break unhealthy thought and behavior patterns and teach them healthier, approved coping mechanisms.

One of the methods I would use to break cycles of negative thought patterns is called affirmations. If you have ever heard of “manifesting,” then you probably already have a decent understanding of affirmations, as the process is basically the same. Instead of negative thoughts, like “I am a failure, and I'll never finish this story,” I taught people to think positive thoughts, like “I can grow from this, I will continue writing one paragraph at a time.” For most individuals, introducing these positive thought patterns was a benefited their lives, and resulted in higher overall mood and self-esteem.

Key word: Most.

For a few, the affirmations became borderline narcissistic in nature and unreasonable; beyond the scope of what any person could actually accomplish with just positive thoughts, and some affirmations that seemingly transcended possibility altogether. They would share their affirmations with me in our scheduled sessions, and where most people would have mantras on the level of “I am an okay person, and nobody actually hates me,” these patients’ mantras would be more similar to “I will be the greatest there ever was at ‘X’ sport,” or “I will get promoted to CEO at work.” 

While I did not encourage these thought patterns, I also did not discourage them as much as I should have, in hindsight. So what if they never became the best baseball player ever, or still got passed up for promotions at work? It still gave them a goal to work towards. Overly positive thoughts are still better than negative thoughts, right?

Wrong.



It all started with Jeanine. Jeanine was a twenty-something novelist hopeful with seven unpublished novels sitting dormant on her laptop's hard drive. She came in one day and, after our usual banter and debrief of the previous couple of weeks, she shared her new affirmations with me.

“I will get a book published.” She said, a somewhat reasonable goal. “I will be successful.” A markedly less achievable goal. “The book will make a best-seller list in the first month.” A completely absurd endeavor, I thought to myself. 

“Good, Jeanine! Those are some big goals. Have you started the process yet?” I asked, my doubts pushed to the back of my mind, where they would not help my face to betray me.

“No! But like you've said, I can do anything I put my mind to! And I've been praying my affirmations daily!” She almost shouted, gleefully. 

Praying? That was an unusual way to put it, but not so unusual at the time to warrant questioning her. She had said in a previous session that she was religious, after all.

“Good! Now set a realistic timeline for yourself so you stay on track!” I oozed, attempting to both mirror and temper her enthusiasm in the same sentence.

“Hmm, how does two months sound?” She beamed. Two months to write a novel seemed wild to me, but two months to write, get published, and top a chart? Insanity.

“Are you sure you don't want to make this a more long-term goal, Jeanine?” I spoke as if I were trying to defuse a bomb with my words, afraid that too much negativity would cause a regression.

“No, I'm pretty confident! I plan to start writing today!” She said, her smile only growing wider, and as soon as the final syllable left her lips, the little egg timer I used to keep to a standard one-hour session chimed. “See you in a couple of weeks!”

She was gone before I could say another word. 

In her next session, she mentioned that she had experienced a sudden burst of inspiration and was almost completely through writing a new novel. In the following session, the novel was completed, and she spoke of multiple publishers getting back to her, interested not only in the novel she had submitted, but also in anything else that had come of her “genius” mind. 

She did not come to the session after that one; instead, she sent me a signed copy of her book. The cover art was a dark silhouette of a person from the shoulder up, with thin white streaks branching out from it. At the bottom left corner, a bright golden seal gleamed up at me. 

Best Seller, Georgia Times.

I was given a bold, praising mention on the very first page of the book with lettering:
“Special thanks to Dr. Edmund, none of this would have been possible without your positive guidance!” 

It shouldn’t have been possible, even with my guidance. 

The name of my practice and my business phone number were also mentioned, followed by the tagline “Call for a miracle!”

I was no doctor, but even so, the calls came in. Within a week, every open time-slot was filled, and I was working almost every day, around the clock, just to keep up. Nothing changed about the way I practiced my craft, and, for the most part, nothing changed in the lives of those who sought my aid.

It only took a few months for the hype to wear off, and my list of clients to dwindle to only slightly-above-average numbers, but, unfortunately, the new clients weren’t the only ones who took notice of Jeanine’s little “miracle.”



“Rising local author, Jeanine ____ missing from her Georgia home. Foul play suspected. Please call local law enforcement if you have any information that may lead to …(read more)”

The notification from the news app on my phone made my breath catch in my throat, and my right hand release the spoon that was hanging precariously above my bowl of Frosted Flakes. Before my finger could even obey the thought to tap (read more), three loud knocks rang out from my front door. I was not expecting company.

“Police,” the disembodied voice rang through my house, “we are here to discuss the disappearance of Jeanine _____. We just want to talk.”

I hesitantly stood up and made my way to the door. The frosted glass made determining who lay beyond nigh impossible, and when I tried to take a peek through the peephole, I found it to be covered.

“I was just her therapist, I didn’t really know her personally,” I said, but the voice at the door insisted. I unlocked the door, and as if on cue, it burst inwards, knocking me to the ground. Three men entered my home: two wearing tactical gear and carrying large, heavy-looking black flashlights, and a third wearing a suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.

The two tactically geared men grabbed my arms, clasped my wrists together with handcuffs that seemed too heavy for their size, and led me to my couch. The well-dressed man laid his briefcase out on my coffee table and spoke. “Scan the house. No more uncontained witnesses.” His accent was unreadable, and his tone plain and flat. The men left our presence and began throwing doors open as he turned to me directly.

“Mr. Edmund, I presume?” His words sounded more like a statement than a question. “Call me Mr. H. I'm sure you have an idea of why we're here?”

“Yes… Sir?” I responded timidly, still rubbing at the arm that I’d landed on only moments before. Truthfully, my only hint was what they shouted before kicking my door in, but I still got the hint.

“We understand that you played a part in this woman's sudden rise to fame? Her little miracle?” He slid a photo across the table to me. It was Jeanine, bound and gagged in a dark room, makeup running down her face, and Subject N-94 stamped at the bottom in blocky lettering.

“Hardly, sir. I was just her therapist. I couldn't believe it either when she wrote the entire novel in just a month,” I said truthfully, motioning to the book, which sat closed at the opposite edge of the table from Mr. H.

He gave it only a cursory glance before looking back at me, slight confusion tugging at his brow. Before he had a chance to continue, the two other men returned to the room. 

“Nobody else here, sir.” The first said, holstering his flashlight.

“No abnormal LF readings either, not even a hair above base…” the second started to say, before the small box with an antenna in his hand began to beep slowly, “hang on, I'm getting a reading in here.”

He circled slowly around the living room, pointing the antenna first at me, then to the floor, neither of which produced any measurable difference. Finally, he pointed it at the book on the coffee table.

Beep. Beep. Beep. -KZZZZKT-

The small box emitted a string of beeps, followed by shrill static. The man holding it turned a dial and moved it closer to the book, which resulted in it emitting a noise reminiscent of a choir singing slightly out of key. The man spoke, peering down at a small digital display on the device: “Residual LF readings. Pattern congruent with Subject N-94's signature.”

Mr. H gazed up at the men and nodded, prompting them to unhandcuff me. I rubbed at my wrists where the metal had pressed into them. There was something wrong about that metal, unholy even. This would not be my last run-in with what I would later learn to be called Longinium.

“Very well, Mr. Edmund. I believe you now, you're entirely clueless,” Mr. H said, a slight smirk curling the edges of his lips. I breathed a shaky sigh of relief, and he continued, “But there is still the matter of what to do with you. You know too much. Hell, everyone who read that book knows too much, but they all at least think it's just some torture-porn sci-fi novel.”

“You mean… it isn't?” I asked, my jaw never returning to its natural position. The contents of that book had to be fiction… gods… demons… the Fates… there was no way any of that could be real… right? That must mean…

“You work for H…” I tried to say, but couldn't finish my sentence, as one of the men standing behind me walloped me in the back, knocking the wind out of me. 

Mr H's smirk grew to a grin. “And now you know even more that you shouldn't,” he oozed as he eyed me greedily, “Yet, you may actually be useful to us. Tell me, doctor, what are your methods?”

Fearing the alternative to being found “useful” to Mr. H and his goons, I recounted the events leading up to and following Jeanine’s final session with me. In the beginning, the faces of the other three men remained unreadable. Then I got to the session where she shared her three final affirmations with me. Mr. H's face betrayed fascination when I mentioned her method of affirming her goals.

“Prayer? Who was she praying to? Did she mention a name? A deity? A specific religion, even?” He questioned, and either interest or worry caused his voice to rise an octave higher than the gruff one he had forced previously.

“No, sir, she simply stated that she was praying her affirmations daily,” I relayed, “she mentioned she was religious, but never said which one.”

Mr. H stood, his hands shaking slightly, and spoke his next words slowly and deliberately. “I hope you’re right. Religions are useful, doctor. They bind belief to a greater power, something outside of one's own control. Without that binding… and without the self-limiting factors of doubt and fear, things like her are dangerous.”

“Things like her? What is she?” I asked, my head tilting to the side automatically.

His eyes met mine, and his next word inexplicably evoked a sense of terror I had not felt since childhood.

“Fallen.”



For the first year or so, I was not allowed to leave the bunker. I had skills that they found useful, but I was untrusted, unproven, and considered an information leak risk. How ironic that it is only now, after the better half of a decade, that I finally come forward and tell my story. After gaining their trust. If only they’d been honest with me from the start, but who knows? Maybe they didn’t even know the full extent of our meddling.

That was seven years ago. I have come to learn that Mr. H’s terminology is always intentionally vague. I am still not entirely certain what a Fallen is, what exactly differentiates them from baseline humanity, or what they are truly capable of without guide rails in place. In fact, I am left in the dark about most things, despite my until-recently thriving business relationship with Mr. H and his employer. I have, however, seen a glimpse of why they are so dangerous if not contained. First-hand.

My job within the organization was actually quite similar to my job before I was recruited, save a few key factors: 

I was paid by the month, not per client (though the pay was much better than I could ever dream of earning doing individual clients by myself) 
I no longer could choose my clients (which official documentation referred to as conduits, but that term is much too impersonal for my profession); they are chosen for me.
Clients always came in sets of three.
Clients’ affirmations were pre-written by the organization.
Clients stayed with me until their goals were accomplished. I never saw the same individual more than once, either.

The oddest parts of this unusual situation, however, were the affirmations themselves. They weren’t personal, like normal affirmations should be, nor were they designed to benefit the affirmer in any way that I could tell; they often involved major regime changes, large amounts of money passing hands, beginnings and ends of wars, and, one time, the results of a Super Bowl. Additionally, each individual did not present themselves to me with different affirmations; they were always the same. All three clients would be focused on the same outcome of the same event.

It wasn’t until I found the document that my mundane day-to-day began to grow heavy on my conscience. The bundle of papers had seemingly been slipped under my office door while I was away on vacation, and consisted of several lists of previous clients’ affirmations and outcomes of the session. I immediately recognized this document because I, in fact, was the one who created it; however, taped to the back of the spreadsheet was a small, indigo colored flashdrive, with a single word written on it in black marker.

Consequences.

My heart skipped a beat, and I immediately looked around to ensure that I wasn’t being watched. Weary of plugging this serendipitously discovered flash drive into my surely-monitored work terminal, I opted instead to browse it using my personal laptop, disconnected from any source of internet or intranet connection, and housed within a virtual machine, just in case it was viral. My worries about cybersecurity were quickly replaced with a deep dread as line after line of data populated on my screen. The majority of the document remained the same as the paper copy I held in my hands only moments before, except for an additional column.

Counterbalance.

For every seemingly neutral or positive event that had transpired under my direction, tragedy and loss-of-life coincided. 

Affirmation: The Los Angeles Rams Will Win Super Bowl in 2022. Outcome: Successful. Counterbalance: Rising tension in Eastern Europe, leading to an ongoing mass casualty event.

Affirmation: A Major Regime Change in the Middle. East. Outcome: Moderate Success. Counterbalance: Unexplainable hurricane formation over the Atlantic. Mass casualty event.

Affirmation: A Foreign Power will overtake a major US industry. Outcome: Moderate Success. Counterbalance: Sudden earthquakes in Asia, unusual winter weather in the US. Mass casualty event.

The list went on and on, page after page of tragedies, all an indirect result of my work. A counterbalance to my meddling with Fate. I read all the way down to the bottom line, expecting to see my most recent session’s affirmations and results, but I was instead met with an unfinished entry dated for the day I left for vacation.

Affirmation: Mr. Edmund will be met with a terrible fate. Outcome: TBD. Counterbalance: TBD.

A few days ago, there was a post from u/elecoffee about their “journey” of starting a coffee brand. While framed as a personal story, it was very clearly promotional in nature—and somehow it was allowed to stay up.

I’m writing this post to explain why content like that should not be permitted here, and how it actively damages the credibility of this subreddit.

Coming to the point: I’m a coffee enthusiast, and admittedly, I made the mistake of ordering the product. The price was low enough that I thought, what’s the worst that could happen? What I lost wasn’t the money—it was my trust in the moderation standards of this sub.

The coffee itself was frankly unacceptable. The roast quality was wildly inconsistent, and the cup profile was flat and muddy, with no identifiable characteristics. It was very clear that the person behind the brand does not have even a basic understanding of coffee roasting or processing.

What made it worse was the comment section on the original post. People were asking fundamental questions—such as proper terminology around ground coffee—and the responses demonstrated a lack of even entry-level knowledge. When someone doesn’t know the difference between “ground coffee” and “coffee powder,” it raises serious concerns about what they’re trying to sell and to whom.

This is exactly why promotional posts disguised as “journeys” or “stories” should not be allowed. They mislead community members, exploit trust, and reduce the quality of discussion in the sub. This isn’t about gatekeeping—it’s about protecting the community from low-effort commercial attempts designed to make a quick buck.

I strongly believe posts like these should be removed, and clearer boundaries should be enforced. Otherwise, the sub risks becoming a marketing channel rather than a space for genuine discussion and knowledge-sharing.",39,1768553465.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.94,False

1qeawzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadcast0Tech/comments/1qeawzq/ishowspeeds_tour_bus_just_solved_broadcast/,IShowSpeed's Tour Bus Just Solved Broadcast Engineering's Hardest Problem,"For 35 straight days beginning August 28, 2025, a tour bus traveling across America became an unlikely testing ground for the future of broadcast technology. IShowSpeed's ""Speed Does America"" tour attracted millions of viewers watching a content creator's cross-country journey, but the real story was happening in the technical infrastructure keeping that stream alive.

What technical director Slipz and his team accomplished using TVU's cloud production platform represents a significant milestone: maintaining professional multi-camera broadcast quality from a vehicle moving at highway speeds through some of the most connectivity-challenged terrain in America. After examining the technical implementation, what becomes clear is that this wasn't just impressive engineering—it was proof that cloud-native production workflows can now handle challenges that would have been insurmountable just a few years ago.

**The Problem Nobody Had Solved Yet**

Mobile broadcasting isn't new. Satellite news gathering trucks have covered remote events for decades. Outside broadcast vehicles produce major sporting events from temporary venues. REMI production lets broadcasters produce events remotely, separating camera locations from production control rooms.

But all these approaches share a common assumption: you're either stationary when broadcasting, or you're not broadcasting while moving. Satellite trucks drive to locations, park, deploy equipment, point their dishes at geostationary orbit, and broadcast. OB trucks serve as mobile facilities that establish themselves at venues. REMI assumes you're working from fixed locations—stadiums, arenas, venues with established connectivity infrastructure.

Speed's tour needed something different: continuous live production while actually moving. Four synchronized cameras. Professional switching between angles. Graphics and audio mixing. All while the bus traveled at 70 mph through rural Wyoming, Montana, West Texas—places where cellular coverage doesn't just degrade, it completely vanishes for extended stretches.

This is what I'd call REMI-on-the-move, and it's a fundamentally different engineering challenge. You can't run fiber to a moving vehicle. You can't maintain satellite lock to geostationary orbit while rolling down the interstate. Traditional approaches simply don't work.

https://preview.redd.it/qc4li4j8dodg1.png?width=2543&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d0ca7ebfbc8f3f144edd56c1b38b1aa926008f

**Why Cellular Bonding Alone Isn't Enough**

Cellular bonding technology has existed for years and works well in many scenarios. The principle is straightforward: combine multiple cellular modems (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint), aggregate their bandwidth, intelligently route packets across available connections, and smooth over individual link variability. In urban and suburban environments, this approach delivers reliable connectivity.

But drive through actual rural America—not scenic highways near cities, but genuine middle-of-nowhere stretches—and you'll encounter a problem no amount of bonding can solve: all carriers simultaneously dropping to zero. There are regions where AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and every other carrier simply have no coverage at all. No towers. No signal. Nothing to bond.

TVU's ISX (Inverse Statmux) algorithm takes a different architectural approach. Instead of treating cellular as primary with Starlink backup, Starlink becomes the backbone. The algorithm continuously monitors each network path independently—analyzing latency, bandwidth, packet loss, and jitter in real-time for every available connection.

What separates ISX from simpler bonding approaches is predictive adaptation rather than reactive adjustment. The algorithm doesn't wait until a connection degrades to respond—it projects when degradation is coming. Approaching a cell tower's edge? Signal strength trends downward and the system preemptively shifts load to other paths before packet loss begins. Entering network congestion? Bandwidth projection identifies the pattern and redistributes traffic before throughput crashes.

This predictive capability relies on RaptorQ forward error correction, a rateless fountain code achieving near-optimal efficiency with only 5% overhead. Traditional FEC allocates fixed protection bandwidth regardless of actual need, wasting capacity. RaptorQ generates encoded packets dynamically based on real-time conditions. The decoder reconstructs original data from any sufficient subset of received packets, completely eliminating retransmission requirements.

Why does eliminating retransmission matter? When targeting 0.3-second glass-to-glass latency over cellular networks, every millisecond counts. Traditional ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) protocols add latency every time a lost packet needs retransmission—often 50-100ms or more per round-trip. Multiply that across thousands of packets and you've destroyed your latency budget. RaptorQ eliminates those round-trips entirely, keeping latency low enough for broadcast-grade production.

**Starlink Changes the Connectivity Equation**

Starlink's role deserves deeper examination. Traditional satellite news gathering relies on geostationary satellites positioned 22,000 miles above the equator. Physics dictates minimum round-trip latency around 600ms—before any processing or routing delays. That latency makes natural conversation difficult and production workflows painful. You can work with it, but every interaction carries that delay.

Starlink's Low Earth Orbit constellation operates at roughly 340 miles altitude. That dramatically shorter distance yields 25-60ms latency—comparable to good terrestrial connections. You maintain satellite's coverage advantage (works anywhere with clear sky view) without the latency penalty that plagued geostationary solutions.

The hybrid architecture bonds Starlink's consistent low-latency backbone with cellular's additional bandwidth when available. When cellular connections are strong, you get higher total throughput. When cellular vanishes in rural areas, Starlink maintains the link. The result is coverage literally anywhere the bus could drive, with latency low enough for natural interaction and frame-accurate production switching.

**Frame-Accurate Switching Without Physical Sync**

Here's a production challenge that's harder than it sounds: how do you achieve frame-accurate multi-camera switching when your cameras are encoding independently on a moving vehicle, transmitting over bonded cellular and satellite with variable latency, and decoding in a cloud environment potentially thousands of miles away?

Traditional broadcast production uses a sync generator providing master clock reference. Every camera, every video source, every piece of equipment locks to that reference. Frame-accurate switching is straightforward when everything shares the same timing foundation.

Speed's production environment had none of that infrastructure. Four cameras on the bus, each encoding video independently. Those streams transmitted over whatever network paths were available at any moment—some packets over Starlink, some over AT&T cellular, some over Verizon, constantly shifting as conditions changed. Network jitter meant packets from different cameras arrived at wildly different times. There was no physical sync generator. No shared timing reference. No genlock signal.

TVU's TimeLock technology solves this through precise timestamping combined with intelligent buffering. Each video frame and its associated audio gets timestamped at the exact moment of capture. Those timestamps travel with the encoded data regardless of what network path delivers them.

At the cloud decoder, the system maintains a delay buffer sized to accommodate maximum expected network jitter—typically 0.5 seconds for synchronized multi-camera REMI production. Within that buffer, frames from all cameras are aligned by their original capture timestamps, then released simultaneously to the production switcher.

The RPS One units on Speed's bus each handled four synchronized SDI inputs, encoding at up to 1080p HDR. All four feeds maintained perfect frame alignment despite packets potentially taking completely different routes through the bonded network. When those feeds arrived at TVU Producer in the cloud, the production team could cut between camera angles with the same frame accuracy expected from traditional broadcast. No temporal jumps. No audio drift. Just clean, professional switching.

**Production Control Becomes Location-Independent**

Traditional broadcast production physically concentrates people and equipment. Everyone's in the same control room or the same OB truck, looking at the same monitors, communicating directly. Camera feeds come in, the director calls shots, technical director switches cameras, audio engineer mixes sound, graphics operator inserts elements, and the program goes out. Physical proximity enables coordination.

Speed Does America distributed this model across the internet. The bus with cameras and talent traveled across America. Production control existed as cloud services accessible from anywhere. Slipz's team could be in Los Angeles, New York, their homes, a coffee shop—anywhere with a browser and decent internet—switching cameras, inserting graphics, triggering replays, mixing audio, managing program output.

TVU Producer provides complete production capability for this distributed workflow. It handles up to 12 simultaneous live feeds with professional features: preview/program switching workflow, per-channel audio mixing with individual level control, graphics overlay supporting PNG alpha channels plus integrated [Singular.live](http://Singular.live) for dynamic graphics, instant replay with variable-speed playback, and simultaneous output to multiple streaming destinations.

The switching uses TVU's patent-pending frame-accurate technology that overcomes internet delay. Even with variable network latency between the bus and cloud production, the system achieves precise cuts at intended frames. This isn't approximation or ""close enough""—it's genuine broadcast-grade switching accuracy achieved entirely through cloud software.

The architectural elegance comes from microservices design. Switching, encoding, audio mixing, and graphics all run as independent cloud services. Need more processing power for complex graphics rendering? Cloud infrastructure scales transparently. Want to integrate remote guests? TVU Partyline connects directly using the same ISX protocol for ultra-low-latency bidirectional video and audio.

**Solving Real-Time Communication Across Distance**

Production communication presents a challenge that doesn't get enough attention. In traditional production, directors communicate with camera operators and talent through IFB (Interruptible Fold-Back) systems—dedicated audio return paths. It's simple when the production truck is parked outside the venue or everyone's in the same facility.

Remote production breaks this. You could use Zoom, Teams, or other consumer tools for communication, but those introduce 300-400ms latency. Try directing a camera operator with that delay: by the time they hear ""pan left,"" the moment has passed. Natural direction becomes impossible. Production coordination suffers.

TVU Partyline integrates into the production workflow using the same IS+ transmission backbone as video feeds. The Real-Time Interactive Layer delivers mix-minus audio with imperceptible latency—typically under 100ms. The production crew, regardless of physical location, could communicate with the bus team as naturally as sharing a control room.

This isn't a minor feature—it's fundamental to making distributed production work. Directors can call shots in real-time. Camera operators hear direction without confusion-inducing delay. Conversations flow naturally. The distributed team functions as a cohesive unit rather than fighting communication lag.

**Why Traditional Approaches Are Economically Impossible**

The economics of traditional broadcast infrastructure make Speed's tour impossible using conventional approaches. Let's examine the numbers.

A medium outside broadcast truck (8-16 cameras, 10-14 workstations) represents $2-5 million in capital equipment. That's the entry cost before you turn it on. Operating costs include vehicle maintenance, fuel, generator operation, insurance, and most significantly—staff travel and accommodation.

For a 35-day tour across 25 states, you'd need the truck constantly moving. Diesel for a large production truck traveling cross-country for 35 days runs into tens of thousands of dollars. Full crew requiring hotels every night—conservatively 6-8 people at $150/night average equals $63,000-$84,000 in lodging alone. Add per diem, flights to and from tour locations, vehicle insurance, and crew fatigue from 35 consecutive days on the road.

Satellite transmission makes it worse. Ku-band satellite time costs approximately $500/hour. For 35 days of continuous streaming (840 hours), that's $420,000 just for transmission—assuming you could maintain satellite connectivity while moving, which you can't. Traditional satellite trucks must park and point dishes at specific geostationary satellites. You can't do that while traveling at highway speeds.

Add operational complexity: surveying each location for satellite line-of-sight, coordinating satellite time bookings across different regions, managing BISS encryption for signal security, dealing with weather that blocks Ku-band signals (rain fade). It's not just expensive—it's logistically impossible for a continuously moving vehicle.

TVU's approach eliminates these cost categories. RPS One units cost a fraction of an OB truck—tens of thousands versus millions. Starlink Mobile Priority with full in-motion capability runs $250/month. Cellular data costs, even with aggressive multi-carrier bonding, are orders of magnitude less than satellite time. TVU Producer uses consumption-based cloud pricing rather than capital expenditure.

The larger savings come from eliminated travel. Industry data consistently shows REMI workflows achieve 30-70% cost reduction versus traditional OB production, primarily through eliminated travel expenses. ESPN publicly stated they achieved 30% production cost reduction across operations using REMI technology.

For Speed's tour, this means hundreds of thousands in savings. Production crew works from home or established facilities. No hotels. No per diem. No flights. No crew fatigue. The economic advantage is overwhelming—making productions viable that would be completely cost-prohibitive using traditional infrastructure.

**Broadcast Quality From Equipment You Could Carry On a Plane**

Watching clips from Speed Does America, what impressed me wasn't just that the technology worked—it was how professional it looked. Multiple camera angles switching cleanly. Graphics appearing crisp and properly overlaid. Audio quality remaining broadcast-grade despite the bus traveling through areas where my phone regularly loses signal entirely. The stream genuinely looked like professional television, not amateur phone footage from a moving vehicle.

This demonstrates cloud production workflows maturing from ""acceptable for emergencies"" to ""indistinguishable from traditional broadcast."" The HEVC encoding in RPS One units achieves broadcast-quality 4K HDR at bitrates as low as 3 Mbps through efficient compression. That efficiency is critical when available bandwidth is whatever combination of cellular and Starlink can provide while traveling through rural America.

Variable bitrate encoding dynamically adjusts compression based on real-time bandwidth availability. When connectivity tightens—entering low-coverage areas or hitting network congestion—the encoder gracefully reduces quality rather than dropping frames or stuttering. Viewers experience slightly lower resolution rather than frozen screens or buffering. When bandwidth improves, quality automatically increases. It's a much better viewing experience than binary ""working perfectly or completely broken"" behavior.

The RPS One form factor matters too. Under 2kg weight and only 200mm tall—it's the most compact full-featured 5G multi-camera transmitter available. Compare that to rack equipment and cable infrastructure required for traditional remote production. Speed's entire production capability—professional multi-camera broadcast—operated with equipment fitting in a carry-on bag.

That portability fundamentally expands coverage possibilities. Narrow urban streets. Remote natural locations without vehicle access. Anywhere the bus could drive, broadcast-quality production could happen. Form factor isn't just convenience—it's enabling coverage that traditional equipment physically couldn't reach.

**Applications Beyond Creator Content**

Speed's tour provides a template with serious implications across multiple industries.

Local news sees immediate application. A reporter with an RPS One backpack delivers synchronized multi-camera coverage from any breaking news location. The station's existing control room handles production—switching, graphics, audio. No live truck dispatch. No satellite coordination. Just get the reporter to the scene. Breaking news coverage becomes faster, cheaper, more flexible.

Sports broadcasting already embraced REMI, but current implementations assume fixed venues. The NHL produced 160+ games in a season using REMI workflows—in arenas with installed connectivity. NASCAR consolidated production to a Charlotte studio handling 30 events remotely—at established racetracks with known infrastructure.

Speed's tour proved the same quality is achievable from vehicles moving between venues. This enables coverage of inherently mobile sports: endurance events like ultramarathons, rally racing across varied terrain, professional cycling tours, sailing competitions, adventure racing. You can now produce these with broadcast quality without impossible logistics of moving production trucks around.

Enterprise applications may have the most significant long-term impact. Corporate events, product launches, training sessions, executive communications—scenarios where professional production quality was cost-prohibitive become accessible. No studio rental. No OB truck. A single operator with TVU equipment delivers multi-camera HD production with global streaming.

The industry calls this ""democratization of broadcast."" Speed's tour demonstrates it concretely: a 20-year-old content creator produced more continuous live programming over 35 days than most regional TV networks, with quality matching or exceeding local broadcast standards, using technology fitting on a tour bus. That's practical reality, not theoretical possibility.

**The Latency Number That Matters**

That 0.3-second latency figure for ISX transmission over cellular keeps standing out. It seems like technical detail, but it represents a fundamental shift in what's possible.

Traditional broadcast wisdom held cellular couldn't deliver production-grade latency. Variability was too high. Buffering requirements were too large. You could use cellular for breaking news where lag was acceptable, or live shots where delay didn't matter. But not for switched multi-camera production where frame accuracy and timing precision are critical.

ISX protocol's predictive adaptation changes this fundamentally. By projecting network conditions rather than reacting, by using fountain code FEC eliminating retransmission delays, by routing individual packets to optimal paths based on real-time conditions, TVU achieved latency competitive with dedicated fiber. Speed's tour proved this works at scale, under adverse conditions, continuously for over a month.

For broadcast professionals, this should trigger reevaluation of what's achievable with IP-based remote production. Technology isn't the constraint anymore. The constraint is imagination—and willingness to trust cloud workflows with the confidence traditionally placed in hardware infrastructure.

**The Accidental Innovation**

IShowSpeed likely doesn't consider himself advancing broadcast technology. He's creating content for his audience. Pushing boundaries builds viewership. The technical infrastructure is just the means to execute creative vision.

But that infrastructure—continuous professional production from a moving vehicle across a continent—represents genuine innovation in how live media gets produced. The TVU Networks partnership wasn't just sponsorship. It was a real-world stress test of cloud production architecture under conditions no lab could replicate.

Every cellular dead zone, every satellite handover, every bandwidth crunch, every unexpected connectivity challenge became data proving system resilience. When Slipz says ""we're locked in—rock-solid tech, backup when we need it,"" he's describing continuous operation validating technology that will shape mobile production approaches for years.

Traditional broadcast infrastructure evolved over decades solving reliability, quality, and scale problems. Speed Does America compressed that evolution into 35 days, proving cloud-native production can match those standards while enabling previously impossible coverage models. That's not just technically impressive—it's demonstrating the future of how live content gets made.",1,1768553404.0,Broadcast0Tech,0,1.0,False

After using Windows for many years with Photoshop and Epson printers I bought a MacBook a year ago, thinking this was the way to go. I use photoshop mainly to prep positives for polymer photogravure, and I need colour and printing accuracy.

The problems I’ve found so far:

1) it’s almost impossible to save printer presets reliably. I know the workarounds. Some work better than others. This should just work and it doesn’t. Works flawlessly in Windows.

2) When I have a MacOS upgrade, photoshop loses the icc profiles for my Epson Surecolor 9500 and it’s a performance to reinstate them, undocumented by Apple, Adobe or Epson as is the presets issue. This is nonsense too. Works fine in Windows.

If I’m labouring under a misapprehension, and none of this is really a problem, please correct me.

I’m an amateur when it comes to photoshop, though I’ve been using it for twenty years. I’m a computing professional though, with 35 years experience. I know that someone within the vendor structure will understand exactly what the issue is, and I suspect that the lack of a fix will have to do with inter vendor commercials.

I guess my question is, how do professionals who depend on this stuff cope? Why do they pay the money they do and tolerate this bullshit with basic functionality?

Please don’t tell me the problems are a result of MacOS being better than Windows. Got too much grey hair to hear that.

I’m not planning to go back to Windows. Not yet. I like my MacBook. It looks great in the coffee shop beside a cold cup of artisanal brew.

What I didn’t realize is that this isn’t really a productivity issue - it’s a mindset loop. The brain gets used to chasing “more” and quietly ignores “enough.”

Reading When It’s Never Enough: Why We Keep Chasing More and Still Feel Empty helped me put words to that feeling. The book doesn’t tell you to stop being ambitious or productive. It explains why productivity can turn into pressure, and how constantly striving without pausing can drain satisfaction even when things are going well.

What I liked most is that it made productivity feel lighter. Less about squeezing more output out of myself, more about being intentional with where my energy actually goes.

If you enjoy productivity conversations but sometimes feel like the grind never lets you breathe, I genuinely recommend this book. It pairs well with a cup of coffee and a moment of honesty with yourself.

What happened?","So, I decided to see how the game was doing since I hadn’t played in a while and didn’t check anything related to it either. The first thing I noticed was there were way more ads than before. I know there were ads before, but they were usually to get free items or zombies if I remember correctly. Now they play after every 2 levels. I was pleasantly surprised to see a new area and new zombies when I checked the map! However, after doing everything in the new area, it felt really lazy to me. Some of the zombie designs were nice like Coffee Joe and the boss, but all the others felt lazy. Like, Protein Jock Zombie is just Ice Cream Zombie in football gear. Sure, they do reuse zombies sometimes, but at least they always take it in a cool direction with a complete redesign like Banana Zombie and Choco Zombie, or Shrimb Zombie and Rocket Zombie. They feel unique despite being the same. That’s not even mentioning that it’s literally just reskinned Chinatown. Now, I would let that slide since you could say Snow is reskinned Beach without being too far off, but the soundtrack and boss are the exact same. If they used new music and maybe did some better designs for the background and objects, I’d be fine with it though. Now, I love Chinatown because of all the unique ways the zombies traverse the map. The new update just has them use jet packs. It doesn’t even fit half of the designs either! There were so many cool idea they could have done. Imagine a zombie who glides with a newspaper, or a zombie who leaps from one roof to the next, and you have to try and catch it before it jumps? Those would be cool, but they just were lazy! The boss really broke it for me though. First off, he was bugged so I had to use my plutonium to fight him, and secondly, it’s just Chinatown’s boss! Same animations, same voice, same method of flying, everything! He’s supposed to be a mechanic, why does he use Kung-Fu to cross the gaps and not like, a motorcycle? Imagine if he rode his bike across the roofs, and did a large trick with his bike to cross? That would be so much better, but the just slapped new paint of the Chinatown boss.

(You dont have to read the next 3 paragraphs they are just my personal experience)

Ive tried caffeine: energy drinks, coffee, soda, pre-workout. I don't really notice any change or difference, I normally still feel tired, at most ill just feel a little gross but that's it. I can drink it close to bedtime and still fall asleep. It just doesn't do anything noticeable.

Weed: I've tried weed a decent number of times, I always got offered any time I've had friends, but it kinda sucks. Ive had all 3 types in multiple different ways, as well as alone and with friends and it always feels the same, I just feel the same bleh mood. It doesnt calm me or improve mood, I more so just feel trapped in my head and body, my thoughts still happen and they are still negative, im just forced to listen to it now. It doesnt make me tired more so just zoned out and bored. It doesnt increase any creativity or anything like that, it does the opposite. I just end up sitting there feeling trapped in my mind and body, not wanting to move or do anything, nothings interesting, nothings funny, I just kinda feel like a zombie. It quite literally makes my adhd symptoms worse. And no I didnt smoke too much, it doesnt matter if I take a small hit or an entire joint, I feel the same way just on different levels. Ive only had 1 good reaction to weed and it was the first time I had it, everything was funny and I felt calm and in a good mood, but because I had too much I ended up almost fainting. Any time after that has sucked and never compared.

Alcohol: this is the best one so far but still not amazing. I like that it helps me open up socially so I can be a little more comfortable around people but I dislike drinking alone. When I drink alone it doesn't benefit me really, I risk getting sad since im left alone with my thoughts. It doesnt help me with productivity or executive dysfunction, doesnt help me focus, doesn't really give me energy. It can help me relax sometimes but since its temporary I end up feeling 10x worse when it starts to wear off. Its also a gamble if it'll help me relax or make me feel worse. Then I'm just sad and feel like I wasted my night. I have to be around friends and a fun environment to get guaranteed benefits from it, but days I need help relaxing and feel not the greatest don't tend to fit into that category :/. But in general it just doesnt increase dopamine enough for me to ever get addicted, I rarely drink because it just doesnt seem worth it unless im out with people. I get more dopamine from working on my art or buying something.

I havent tried any other drugs because I just haven't been in situations where I could try them, but with the ones I have tried im rather disappointed by.

I know that it sounds weird that im complaining about this, I understand that im likely lucky because addiction is a horrible thing, I dont want addiction and sometimes im glad I am this way, I just want more relief yk? Im more so just disappointed that I cant get relief. As well as confused since most people with adhd tend to get relief with drugs? So im confused why im different and how many others out there feel the same way?

The only thing thats calmed my mood and anxiety is my vyvanse. The only issue is I rapidly metabolize it and feel super irritable and down less than halfway through the day when I crash, so its going to be hard to make it work for me and still be affordable but im currently working on that.

Now I (22F) like this guy (24M) we have...a loonng history together. To sum it, we met when I was 14, were on a very rocky road, I developed a crush on him for 3 years, he liked my best friend instead, i spiraled and confessed, he rejected me, my bff blocked him, he unfriended me (dont know why either) yada yada. Now him and I ,after all that jazz, stopped talking. I felt like when I had a crush on him, I \*severely\* overlooked the fact that i was pursuing him/chasing him while he was just...there. from checking in on him every now and then thru the months, asking him if he's free so I can come to his hometown and visit him. And although he always responded and agreed to meet, i could tell he wasn't in it.

  
2 years passed. The classic 'i didn't send a msg so he didnt'. On new year's eve however, I got a msg from him. He said he was in this one coffee we used to go to and it reminded him of me and 'overall happy new year'. Now I was significantly surprised but I wasnt giddy either, sent a happy new years back and threw my phone across the room. Well surprisingly so, we kept talking for two weeks after that with him engaging the conversation this time, although kinda low effort, it was evident he was trying to  keep the conversation from dying out. He asked if I come around to his hometown and I said I do. He asked why I never called him and that hes only one text away and all that, so i said we could meet next Thursday if he wants. He agreed. Felt like shit again, cuz honestly I hated the fact that I was still kinda sweet on him and the fact he never \*really\* asks me sometimes. It almost feels like when he agrees to meet, it's just more of a smth in his day to do rather than an event of meeting someone special. And yea tbh, I wanted to cancel the night before, it felt like itt was gonna do more damage than it has to, but me being the doormat that I am didnt.

However, we did text. I did say I always wanted to go to this one forest in his hometown. Its just i never got the chance or my dad never really took me. He said we could go on the car. Backtracked and said that he's grounded from using the car so we're gonna be on the motorcycle instead. I was like '🤷‍♀️'. As long as hes comfy.

  
We did meet. He took me for a good spin. Showed me where he worked, and took me to a summer camping site where he also showed me around. He threw in a ""dont worry we're not completely alone. There are some officers here that im friends with"" since he knows im a bit guarded around that. We sat down somewhere, he brought out a box of cheesecake and juice and said ""i remembe you said you like cheesecakes before right?"". My sweet tooth was completely gone if anything but I was eating that cheesecake like it was the most delicious thing in the world 🥹.  
We kept talking a LOT. for an hour and a half. He also did this thing where he switched to sit on my other side so the smoke of his cigarettes wont blow on my face and for the first time, I felt like this time, this 'hang-out' or whatever it is...I wasn't the one doing all the heavy lifting, we were both just genuinely...having fun.

Now there was a swing behind us on the forest. Not a fancy one, just a makeshift one where kids made out of wooden planks and ropes. I got a childish side to me so I said 'yea i wanna swing' he said 'go ahead ill push you'. I pretended that I was joking and he was like nah get up. I told him to try it first. He did then got up and told me to. My giddy ass started swinging like theres no tomorrow. I wanted to stop because I was getting dizzy and while this might sound simple to some BUT THE WAY HE SUDDENLY STOPPED IT WHILE IT WAS GOING FULL FORCE FROM BEHIND ME WAS- yea. Pretty sure my heart exploded. 

  
Now onto the main event and why im having this dilemma. I was gonna get off the swing, he stopped me and told me to sit down together and we did. Note that it was a tight space so we were literally pressed against each other there. We kept talking. He told me how he ended up being a rebound for someone and it destroyed him and somehow the topic drifted onto that period where I developed my feelings for him. I shrugged and I was like ""yeaaa it happens ig lol im all good now. Whatever"" it was clear that i was salty so he said ""you dont know what the future hides right? Everything falls into place one way or another, we could even get together. Who knows?""

This is supposed to be sweet. But i got bitter. Oh so very bitter. It wasn't easy getting over the him so I hated the butterflies, the excitement to see him despite of everything etc etc. He noticed so he said ""listen. Elina. I didn't get into a relationship with u at the time cuz I felt like ill just...hurt you. I tended to neglect ppl at the time, it wasnt easy but...yea."" 

""Yea well. You sure weren't neglecting \*bff's name\* at the time.""

""You know i gave you plenty of openings to let yk i was interested. You shut down all of them.""

""???? No u didnt???""

""I swear i did. I even asked you if the way u were treating me was special and you were like 'nO I LikE sPoiliNg aLl mY lOvEd oNeS"" 

I laughed. I didn't remember i said that. But it sure does sound like smth id say. 

""Well. I don't remember. But...you \*were\* special. What kind of girl will keep talking to a guy who acted like a slob of ice for 3 years without getting sick of it?""

""Hey now...""

""My point is. You were special. We knew each other for a long time. You liked \*bff\* just from seeing her on 3 insta stories. Yes it does hurt. Especially now. I know I shouldn't be saying this, stereotypes or whatever. But the feelings I had for you were a once in a lifetime thing. That kind of intimacy that doesn't happen twice. If anything I am still very much sweet on you. Theres a reason im still not in a relationship.""

He got a bit quiet here. Then said.

""Okay listen. And listen well. I swear I know how much you loved me. I know out of every girl I know, no one will dare love me more than you ever did. And if theres any girl who is more eligible for me or the best pick for me, I swear its you. Im just...not ready yet. Okay? So much happened and I dont think im ready  for 'where youre going? With who? Why?' And everything relationship related. Ive got so much to figure out so yea...just putting this out there okay?""

I shrugged here and said ""obviously im not gonna pressure you into doing smth you don't want. But...""

""But?""

""I...shouldn't be saying this. But im emotionally driven so fk it. If you're ready and if...only if you want to, I'll be available. I think everything is worth trying hard for as long as it's worth it.""

""Nah no worries im like that too I promise""

""And I don't want you to feel guilty like 'oh i feel bad for her'. thats not what im about but...there's that.'

""Nah I promise you. Dont worry about it okay?""

He gave me a hug here and he kept joking to lighten the mood a bit. We took some pictures. And the ride back was considerably warmer from him picking up my keys for me when they fell, from me accidentally stepping on his shoes and him saying 'step all over me if u feel like it' and a 'there u go u saw the forest. If your father wont take you, I will'. He was about to see me off. I had a phone charm dangling. So I kinda unclasped it and gave it to him. He said ""oh thats for me?""

""I have a copy back home. We're matching now. Do what u will with that information""

He laughed and said goodbye. He sent me later a picture of it hanging off his gamer pc set with a 'so ill always see it' msg. Yeah my heart bursted. And throughout this outing I only fell impossibly deeper in love with him. I thought two years were enough to harden me but...yea look how well that worked. He asked to send him the pictures we took, and checked if I was hungry while waiting for the bus to go and whether I got home safe or not. All of that counted for smth and while I cherished the butterflies, his texting habits didn't change. Still low effort, still minimal. Which is honestly after whatever that outing was (most of my irl ppl said it was a date) is kinda...confusing. him being him, private and secretive shouldnt come off as a surprise but I also don't wanna force smth thats not meant to be there. If u got here, truly thank you. And if you have any clear response I would truly truly TRULY appreciate it. Thank you and have a lovely day ahead.",1,1768551482.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1qeaeei,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolBand/comments/1qeaeei/after_over_a_1_month_of_discovering_tool/,After over a 1 month of discovering tool,"So I discovered tool in December 2025, I’m not some kinda metal expert of smth just a listener/guitarist , I did not listen to all tool albums cause i like to listen to separate tracks (like 3 per 4 at a time) until i get used to the songs then move on to others instead of binging a whole album.

So far i listened to : 7empest - invincible - vicarious - schism - lateralus - sober - forty six & 2 - the pot

And this is my take on the band :

When i listen to metal or hard rock, some adjectives come to mind like “badass “ , “heavy” , “trashy” stuff like that , but the word “genius” never came to my mind until i listened to tool , and the more i listen to em the more i fall in love .. i’m not a morning person , i need some time and a coffee before being 100% and maaan how good it feels to wake up and put a tool song first thing in the morning. The band feels like one genius person not 4 band members, the riffs a godly , the solos are from heaven , the lyrics are genius .. i’m 25 this january i don t know how the fuck i did not discover em earlier",17,1768551422.0,ToolBand,23,0.88,False
1qeae2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qeae2i/espresso_is_very_acidic_sage_bambino_1zpresso_x/,Espresso is very acidic [Sage Bambino / 1zpresso X pro S],"Hello everyone, I've recently started my journey with espresso after a year of pourovers and I'm finding it difficult to dial in the shot.

I have a Sage Bambino, I'm using 18g of beans and I'm aiming at 36-40g of coffee with 25-30s of extraction time (timed from when the pumps comes on).

I'm starting to suspect that my grinder could be the problem, I'm using a 1zpresso x pro s manual grinder, the manufacturer says it's fine for espresso but I'm not so sure, does anyone have experience with it? The coffee I get tends to be very acidic, if I grind coarser I end up with very short extracion times (15-20s) and the coffee is still not very good.

Another variable that honestly came to mind when wiriting the post is that I didn't have the change to try coffees from different roasters and the one I'm using has ""Acidity is not a crime"" as a motto, so it honestly might just be how the coffee is supposed to be.",2,1768551390.0,espresso,13,1.0,False
