I enjoyed meeting a really nice gal for what was to be coffee/potential brunch but got pushed to lunch date when she overslept her alarm.
Okay I’m feeling flexible, I just pushed my 1:00 to 3:00 and rescheduled my 3:00 for next week. 
She’s dressed well, sleeveless sun dress offsets her auburn hair and green eyes and she didn’t complain about the 56° breezy day so I look down to find something to complement her shoes and they are great little leather braid toe loop Sandals but what the heck kind of animal claws are growing three inches out of her toes?
And I’m not taking about a manicured choice of going longer than average. I’m talking about calling the farrier before she founders type of neglect. I said, nice sandals and my voice cracked and I ushered her to our table by the window.
I sipped on my coffee and gazed out the window and tried to imagine a scenario where she was trapped in a collapsed building and had been too busy rescuing bunny rabbits for the past six months to have time for basic self care.
Her hair seemed washed and conditioned and brushed evenly and maybe even cut in the past 3 months. Fingernails painted but chipping slightly, oh well it’s Tuesday, could be from Thursday night and she’s going to redo them tomorrow maybe.
We ordered and had pleasant conversation as I desperately tried to avoid looking down to make sure it was real and not that I had accidentally seen something that wasn’t there. Nope ! There they are OMG is this a Seinfeld episode ?!!!
“The grandfather claws”
Yikes! Still there. Stop looking!
Don’t look again. Drink your coffee. Damn dropped a napkin. Just leave it. You can’t go down there!
Stop thinking about it! 
She’s well read, pursuing her doctorate, she is busy. Cut her some slack. Does she still have bed sheets? Is the mattress ripped to shreds? What happens if she crosses her legs under the table and accidentally disembowels you?
Will anyone call 911 or just run in fear for their lives!
I’ve seen wild mustangs with better hooves.
Then the coup de grace, she lifted her arm to flag down the waiter for another mimosa and there’s a red squirrel under her arm! No wait that’s underarm hair, and it’s been growing for at least 5 years. 
Okay now I’ve got my flaws and I’m not very up to date culturally I admit, but is this the “new normal” they talked about in 2020? 
I looked around to see if anyone else was horrified and they all seemed happily unaware of the beast lurking at the floor and the critter now peeking out from the hem of the beautiful sundress straps seeking whomever it may devour. The waiter masked his shock well and returned to the opposite side of the table with her drink as not to enrage the beast. 
I scarcely was able to pay attention to her story as I was scanning for information about her recently awakening from a 6 year coma but that never came up. In fact she did mention that she was 6 months out of a 4 year relationship which ended over “irreconcilable differences” which I could only  imagine was not about her choices in handbags or Netflix subscription. 
She asked where we should go for our first real date and I swallowed hard and pretended to wipe the corners of my mouth with my replacement napkin to hide my micro expressions and fix my face. (You cannot suggest a spa date can you?) 
Could this be accidentally taking charge of her hygiene and be thereby forever bound to manicure this garden ?
My thoughts raced from go cart racing to a movie trying to minimize possible damage to innocent bystanders or theatre furniture. Perhaps a shoe store date and someone else might mention the elephant toes in the room?
A massage maybe? No not for a first date you imbecile! 
Hurry before you take too long to say somthing…ah too late she looked away and said or maybe not, nice meeting you. She stood up and reached out to shake hands and I thankfully reciprocated and thought to myself that I had narrowly escaped impending doom by some indescribable horrendous fate.
I watched as she turned and walked away and thought there goes a beautiful specimen unattended by self conscious reprieve. You probably just missed a great opportunity to witness a flower blooming late in the fall.

Hey everyone, I recently picked up a medium-dark roast expecting a bold, low-acid profile, but it turned out sharper than anticipated, and it was a bit rough on my stomach.

For context, I brewed it with a pour-over method, using 18 grams of coffee at a grind setting of 19 and a 1:16.6 ratio. I started with a 55 ml pour at 92°C, followed by 70 ml, then a final pour to reach 296 ml. And then tried experimenting it with med fine, bloomed with 36 mls of hot water.. but no luck.

The body and bitterness were kind of fine, but the acidity was surprisingly more pronounced than I expected for a medium-dark.

Normally, I go for this roaster's medium-dark roasts specifically because I wanted something around bold, sweet and smoother and easy on the stomach. 

Did anyone else noticed something similar, or have tips on managing acidity with medium-dark roasts?

Appreciate any insights!

1fz68n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1fz68n7/is_it_really_over/,Is it really over? ,"We've been together for 14 years. We've been through very rough times in life and very positive times. This year we realized how different we are. We do not communicate the same. We do not mentally process things the same. We are realizing we are 50/50 with what we want in life. What I mean is half of us wants the same thing in life, the other half we don't want the same. 

He says I'm too sensitive and needs someone who is soft with their words. I think he can be too blunt and harsh. He has improved over the years where he has learned to be tactful in communication so that's good. I've also improved to not take things so personal. I just think we naturally just communicate and hear words differently. We both appreciate honesty, it's just a matter of how it is communicated. 

We are both unhappy with our careers and want to change so I thought maybe that's why we are unhappy in life. But maybe it's not the careers (although it is a bit soul-sucking).

Our love languages are different. His is Acts of Service and mine is Words of Affirmation. This is very evident in our life. He's a perfectionist and I'm not. He also needs someone who will tell him that they did this and that for him. I need someone who is encouraging with their words. I need emotional depth in a partner and I'm not sure if he is ready to be emotionally deep. I'm not sure if he realizes how his childhood affects him today. I know no parent is perfect but his parents were too consumed in their own lives to realize they had kids to take care of. I grew up in a household where my parents fought all the time so I know chaos and emotional instability. 

We have a dog together. The dog is very affectionate to both of us and I know he will be impacted by a divorce. I get why parents stay in a marriage for their human children. My husband and I talked about sharing the dog but he will most likely be with me most of the time. 

I remember past events where my husband's reactions to things and his words hurt me. I do not bring them up to hurt him but I have brought up a few things for the purpose of communicating my emotional needs. He is understanding of them but being soft is not his strong point. 

We recently moved to a rural area with land because it's what we've been desiring. We've always lived close to the next door neighbor and wanted more space between us and neighbors. The part we forgot to consider is that rural area means no one is out here. So we are both missing social life and friends. I think this has a huge part in our unhappiness in life. We want friends. We've considered selling this house and moving to a busier area. For reference we are in our 30s. This rural area feels like we are aging so fast. Maybe if we moved to a lively area we can both enjoy life together again. 

He has 3 kids from a previous marriage. When we came into each other's lives, I was in my early 20s and the kids were toddlers. I felt like my world change but I asked for it by marrying my husband. I tried my best with the kids but their mother was determined to be an ugly three headed monster to both my husband and me. Eventually, jobs moved us away from the kids and visits decreased to summers and holidays (we were in our late 20s/early 30s). Life was becoming very fun because responsibilities decreased and we enjoyed each other. Now we are in our late 30s and hitting a wall.

We've discussed divorce and what we would separate. We aren't going to hire lawyers if we decide to divorce. We are amicable. We are willing to split everything 50/50. He's willing to help me move into an apartment. There is still love here in this marriage and we both agree and still try to show it to eachother. We hold hands, intimate with each other, make coffee for the other person, go on dates to socialize and improve us, etc. It's just on the fence...

There's so much more to this dilemma. I can't even communicate it in this post because there's so much to unpack. I don't want to talk about it with friends (they don't live near us) because it's a lot to explain. I am starting to wonder if I was single, would I have passion and spark in my life again? I wasn't always such a negative and sad person. I used to smile more before life and responsibilities got so heavy. 

How do you know when it's time to leave? Have you been in my shoes before? If so how did it turn out? Does it sound like I'm trying to rationalize our differences? For reference I think life is gray, not black and white. Do you have any advice?

I hope someone responds to this.  ",1,1728410472.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False
1fz68l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/1fz68l6/low_carb_diet_almost_eliminates_severe_chronic/,Low carb diet almost eliminates severe chronic back pain?,"I have severe chronic debilitating lumbar back pain. My friend invited me to see a soccer game. Where normally it’s difficult for me to stand more than 10 minutes before the pain becomes unbearable, the beer I drank there numbed the back pain to the point where I stood for about 4 to 5 hours. By the end of it, there was some discomfort, but I wasn’t too fucked up. 

The next day, however, I could barely stand and was walking like an old man hunched over. It was unbearably painful. Felt like a truck had hit me and I could not straighten my back. Although I hate taking the pain pills and usually I can lay down if I’m in severe pain, I couldn’t handle it, and I took a tramadol. It didn’t do anything. Yesterday I walked around a tiny bit more, but was still in severe pain leaning forward and not being able to stretch out my back.

I have consumed no carbs since Saturday night when we went to Denny’s after the game. Sunday, I went “low-carb”. Yesterday, I went “no-carb”, all I ate was ground beef and coffee,. Now that I woke up, I have basically zero pain. Keep in mind. I’m usually waking up with about a level 6 to 7 pain. Right now it’s a 1. I know sugar causes inflammation, but this is a drastic difference. It’s not the first time I have noticed that it greatly alleviates my back pain, but wasn’t sure if it was a fasting or carnivore. Since I have been eating, I’m going to say it’s the carnivore/lack of carbs. 

The problem is, it’s not always sustainable for me. I can do like five days of low/no carb before I end up eating bread or tortillas or something else that turns to sugar in the body. And then the pain returns within a day or 2. But doing this is MUCH more effective than tramadol or any treatment I have received in the four years I’ve been dealing with this back pain. And I’ve had it all short of surgery. ",1,1728410468.0,backpain,2,1.0,False

Where I work everyone has offices so not a lot of opportunity to interact except in the break room or if you run into someone outside the building.

One coworker I have a new crush on and always suspected he probably thought I was cute - through prior I didn't have my crush so I wasn't paying close attention. Of course, now, I'm reading into everything.

One day in the break room he asked me if I was from our city and struck up a conversation about that. I had been trying to catch his eye and I wonder if he's noticed. A few weeks later a similar situation. We were in the break room chatting as we each got coffee, he finished and left - but then came back in to ask where I went to college and we chatted some more. I've now done a similar thing to him to reciprocate. He always remembers what we talked about and refers back to details I share - or pokes fun at me using those details.

He's in HR so I know I'll have to ask him out but want to feel more secure he likes me before I do. Or maybe these instances aren't enough for me to have a case to ask him to grab drinks after work. Thoughts?

Also would love any ideas on how to get more one-on-one time with him. I don't feel comfortable asking him out in the break room as anyone could walk in, but the chances of running in to him outside are prettt slim.",1,1728410442.0,Flirting,0,1.0,False

---

*You stand before a magnificent, white marble palace in a well kept and flourishing Oasis.You wander inside the seemingly infinite heaven to a large open throne room. Inside sits the eleven gods of the pantheon.*

About 5 billion years ago eleven gods were born from the Darkness (Nichts) and Light (Alles). Nichts and Alles were part of an ancient race of beings that created the stars, planets and moons but Nichts and Alles created the Earth, Sea and Sky.

The gods once lived in a palace gifted to them by the First Empire and gave knowledge, strength and freedom to humanity after watching them evolve. After the First Grand War, some gods left society while others integrated into it. 

##König: God of Kings and the Sky
Konig was the second born of the eleven gods but became the ruler of the gods due to his brother's erratic behaviour. Konig is a powerful man who brings down anyone who doesn’t obey his every command, this has led to some hatred and uprisings from his family in the past. Konig has command over all the Earth's skies and winds and gives humans the ability to be free. 

Konig rarely gives Humans his blessing but when he does it’s to those whom he sees as powerful and great leaders. 

##Unvern: God of the Sea
Unvern is an erratic and irrational God. In many stories, he is fighting another god which results in him being locked away in the ocean depths most of the time. When he breaks free, and he does, a violent sea follows. Konig will try to control his brother and the result is a vicious sea storm. He gave humans the ability to grow stronger. 

Unvern gives his blessings to those who swear revenge and who dream of a world where they can be free from the shackles of society. 

##Mutter: Goddess of the Earth
Mutter is often regarded as the kindest and most caring goddess, after all, she gave humans food and shelter. This has led to some jealousy from other gods resulting in fights, often leaving Mutter scarred. Mutter however remains a pacifist. Earthquakes are the result of her fear. She gave humans knowledge and has fallen in love with countless humans. 

Mutter gives her power to those who seek to protect their allies and are empathetic towards their enemies. 

##Andsla: God of Joy
Andsla is the bringer of music, art and literature. They believe everyone should have the ability to express themselves. Andsla came about when the first statue was created, depicting the artist dancing with his new wife. Many tales about Andsla have him bringing joy to humans down on their luck through music and art. After the First Grand War Andsla took on the form of a human and has been a pillar of the arts ever since, most recently becoming a movie director. 

##Lizar: God of Survival and War
Lizar was born from the lost and forgotten souls of soldiers killed in battle. He is often seen at the forefront of wars and battles throughout history or wandering through old battlefields carrying lost souls home one final time. Lizar is a master of weaponry and strategy but has no alliance with any single nation, he simply goes where he is needed. In the modern era, he plays the role of a trainer for the Knights of Mons.

He gives his blessing to warriors that have given their nation a good service.

##Villion: Goddess of Love
Villion is often referred to as a goddess but her true form is unknown as she appears to everyone differently. She appears as the person's perfect lover. She is the embodiment of lust and desire but she is also the goddess of friendships and familial love. So the Goddess of Relationships is a more fitting title. 

Villion is the child of Konig and a human (All children born from god's, no matter their other parents origin, are god's) 

She has never given out a blessing.

##Quile: Record Keeper
Although not a god, they are regarded as part of the pantheon. Quile was originally a human genius whom the gods cursed with immortality to help them keep track of the world. Quile can see past, present and future but cannot tell a soul of what he sees. Quile cannot give a human a blessing but they did create the Eye Of Foresight which allows the user to anticipate someone's movements based on past actions. 

They can often be found enjoying a coffee in a local cafe, typing away on a laptop, and always keeping track. 

##Orkoal: Goddess of Fire and the Hearth
Orkoal is the eldest daughter of Mutter. She used to be in charge of housekeeping and babysitting for the other gods but after The Grand War she decided to open up an orphanage with her mother. 

Orkoal is a kind god but unlike her mother, is not a pacifist. Those that harm her or her family will face a furious flame. 

She gives her blessing to those who are forgiving and wish to create a new start for themselves.

##Oltres: God of Inventions
Oltres is said to live on Mount Hana in the Twuai empire. The magma chamber of the volcano acts as his forge where he crafts away. Oltres does not take betrayal kindly as he was betrayed before when a human friend of his stole a weapon of the gods and used it to end an entire army. 

Oltres is the son of Mutter and a human man. 

Oltres gives his blessing to those that are loyal and hardworking.


##Noma: Goddess of Seasons
Noma is the most important goddess to the Northern Front Empire. She, much like Quile, was born a human but became a god when Mutter found her lost in a snowstorm. 

Noma has four children, each one representing a season and most mythos tell of her teaching her children and helping them control their powers. 

After the First Grand War Noma ‘retired’ from her role as a goddess and now walks the earth in a human role. 

She has never given out a blessing.

##Thoma: God of Health and Medicine
Thoma is the patron god for the Twuai Empire as he gave them their healing springs as a reward. Thoma is a protector of patients, the disabled, doctors, nurses and expecting mothers. 

He is always on the lookout for those in need but was gravely injured during the First Grand War. This has slowed down his progress remarkably. 

Thoma doesn't give out typical blessings but he does offer protection and care.

--

These are the 11 gods of the Pantheon. There are other mythical characters so other names might be mentioned during myths.

Please ask any questions you have to any of these lovely gods

Want:

- A cozy place where I can sit down and quietly read a book.  Maybe a decent and quiet-ish place by a pool.

- A great view from windows or a deck where I can look up and see the ocean or amazing landscapes.  Maybe take a break from reading and just mentally zone out.

- Grab a coffee, soda, or maybe an adult beverage or two.  Certainly not looking to get wasted on any day.

- A nice gym where I can get a work out in.  A sauna or a nice spa would be cool but not a must.

- Nice clean accommodations.  Prefer newer rather than old, but old is fine so long as it’s clean and maintained well.

- More casual, but I’m ok with occasional dress up.

- Looking for more quiet time, but occasional socialization is fine.

Don’t need

- a casino

- a ton of activities or shows.  I’ll occupy myself for the most part.

- a booze cruise or loud crowd.  I know this can happen on any ship, and I don’t really care if there are places where it happens as long as I can get my quiet relaxation in while occupying other areas.

- Not fancy but not trashy.  I think it may be a waste of money to go high end (don’t need it), but I’d prefer it over trashy or unclean.

- I don’t need great ports or destinations.  Just looking out the ship and maybe getting off occasionally.  I don’t even care where we travel really.

- Excessive crowds: I don’t care if there are crowds on board (less the better), as long as I can find my space with room somewhere.

- A party environment or a ton of bars.  I just don’t need or want it.

This is kind of the best picture I can present in order to get recommendations.  It’ll be my wife and I traveling, and we live in Maryland but don’t mind flying.  I lean towards a more mature audience, but don’t care if it’s mixed as long as I can find my space as described above.  With that in mind, I want to get the best value possible knowing I don’t need high end entertainment, food, or activities.  I am looking for a comfortable cruise, and it’s going to be made better if I can find nice places to read and sleep.  I don’t need big and magnificent either, but I want it to be clean.

She orders a venti drink with at least 3-4 customizations, but she never pays me back. Every time, she says something like, “Oh, I still need to Venmo you for those other drinks. I’ll do it now,” but then she orders again and never follows through. This has happened three times in the past three weeks.

She's very pregnant (maybe that somehow has something to do with it?!). Honestly, if she told me she couldn’t afford it, I’d happily cover her drink. $7 isn’t a big deal. But the fact that she keeps saying she’ll pay me and doesn’t is getting frustrating.

Looking for tips.,"To start off, I'm 16 years old and I've got a brother. We both study very well I would say, we never failed, got detention or whatever trouble other teenagers get into. We do a lot of chores at home. And while I happily help my dad with everything. My mom is not always so happy. Her only argument is ""You can always do better"" when I'm doing the best that I can. She is a housewife. She stays at home for 24/7, the only time she goes out of the house is durning sunday for church. I don't blame her for this life, she worked at a shop before and she hated it. The main thing I wanna talk about here is how to help my mom and myself. She is pretty much isolated. She never goes out to the neighbors for a little coffee, she never travels anywhere. We never had a vacation. To be honest her whole life looks like a circle of: wake up > do home chores > make food > clean the whole house again > Go to sleep at 1am. But there is one thing she loves to do: talk on the phone, she can do that for hours, she loves inviting guests over but she never wants to go to THEM when they invite her. She often gossips about everybody's life, what they are doing wrong, what they are doing right etc. She could view others pictures of summer, browse their facebook, talk about their whole life or whatever. While she often ignores our privacy and teenage problems. We also learn a lot. Sometimes I wanna take a nap but I can't the door to my room has to be opened at all times. If it's not then she immediately goes to my room to check up on me.  

- ""WHY IS YOUR DOOR CLOSED?""  

- ""Because it is? I'm studing""  

She very often watches the TV as loud as for the whole house because she got used to living alone, when we leave for school and our dad goes out for work she can clean and listen to anything on full volume. But she forgets we are also living here afterwards.   

To end this whole essay, I love my mom. She makes great food, cleans the house at her hardest but she never wants to experience something new. I feel like her live is really boring so thats why she often gets angry, and doesn't understand our problems. We have the money, but we never go anywhere. How do I convience her?

I’m a teacher from Edmonton coming to your beautiful city for an education conference in November. I won’t even pretend I’m not a huge Oilers fan (we all have our flaws, right?), but I’ve always had mad respect for the tradition of the Blackhawks. I'll be staying at the Hilton Chicago or nearby and am hoping to catch the game on November 10.

Where would you suggest I go to grab a single ticket and maybe fit in with a friendly group? When I go to Blue Jays games in Toronto, there are fan groups with verified sellers or people with extra tickets, and I’m hoping there’s something similar in Chicago!

With a little bit of downtime during the conference, what would you recommend I do that's hockey or football related? Think it’s possible to squeeze in both the Bears and the Blackhawks in one day? 😅

Lastly, I’ve heard all about the legendary deep-dish pizza. Where should I go to experience the best slice? I’m all ears for local tips!

I suppose if I'm being candid, I'd love to find some fans that I could catch a coffee or beer with and get the authentic hawks experience at /before the game etc. 

  

Edit: I should add: I am happy to pay a bit extra for a good single seat as well. Or if there's a certain experience you reccomend with food etc.

Thanks so much in advance, and I’m excited to check out your amazing city!

I was laid off from my full-time job earlier this year and have been living on a combination of savings, unemployment, and income from my side gig that I grew from about $80/week to closer to $350/week post-tax. Previously, I made $132,000/year. I know it’s controversial to go on vacation without having full time income, but I decided to still go on this trip because I planned to stay with family most of the trip and I want to enjoy this time off from working full time to do things I don’t often have time for when working full time 9-5, which includes travel.

I first wrote about this trip on [Substack](https://tendollarlatte.substack.com/p/what-i-spent-on-a-road-trip-to-maine) (link pre-approved by mods!) where I write about managing my money in NYC.

**Section One: Bio**

*Age:* 27

*Occupation:* Part-time bartender. I got laid off from a full-time role in operations at a start-up earlier this year, and have been working on my own small business (not paying myself) & bartending while I job hunt (and trying to enjoy life a little)

*Hometown:* NYC suburbs, currently living in NYC (Manhattan)

*Number of PTO days and how you accrue them:* Currently 0, previously I had unlimited PTO, but was actually able to use about 15-20 days/year as PTO/sick time.

**Section Two: Assets + Debt**

*Retirement Balance (and how you got there):* \~$70K. This was mostly built up while living at home for about a year during Covid (and a strong market), but I also have a 401K match at my current job that I contribute 5% to.

*Equity if you're a homeowner:* N/A, I rent

*Savings account balance:* $80K. Honestly, it would have been financially smarter for me to have put more of this towards retirement, but having my emergency fund be closer to 1+ years of spending than 3 months has worked out. I also keep some money in mutual funds, which isn’t for retirement or emergencies, but ideally will be used when I want to buy a house (someday, LOL).

*Checking account balance:* I keep this at around $1,000-3,000.

*Credit card debt:* N/A, paid off each month

*Student loan debt:* N/A, graduated debt free with an bachelor's of science in engineering due to scholarships and family support

**Section Three: Income**

*Main Job Monthly Take Home:* $0.

*Side Gig Monthly Take Home:* Totally varies depending on tips and hours, but for the past couple months, it has been around $1,200/month. The week I traveled, it was $0.

*Any Other Monthly Income Here:* Because I was laid off, I was able to pull from unemployment, which has been about another $800/month. I also run a small business (a card game I mainly sell to small retailers), but I don’t pay myself an income from that.

*Do your parents pitch in monthly?* Do you withdraw from a trust? Do you withdraw from your own savings regularly for whatever reason? I also withdraw from my own savings to cover a portion of expenses each month, with the plan that this is temporary until I increase my income with another full time job.

**Section Four: Travel Expenses**

*Pre-paid expenses:* $10. We planned to stay with family and drive my sister’s car, so I didn’t pre-book any transportation or accommodation.

*Tuesday, June 25th:*

7:00am I started feeling sick last Friday and it still hasn’t gone away. We’re supposed to leave for our trip tomorrow, and I’m starting to feel nervous about making it happen. I had a couple wholesale orders for my small business come in the day before. I had originally planned to drop them off in person since they were local NYC stores, but I instead sent them to my mom (who helps me with order fulfillment) to ship out that day and left my apartment headed to Urgent Care.

8:30am I stopped for a bagel on the way to urgent care. I hadn’t felt very hungry the whole time I was sick, but I knew I needed to eat. **$7.25**

9:00am I tested negative for Covid and the flu at urgent care, and they said it was just a virus. I didn’t have a copay, but we’ll see what I get billed in the mail. **$???**

12:30pm I went home, packed, and caught the subway to Grand Central to head to my sister’s house in the suburbs on Metro North. **$14.65**

4:00pm I had a second interview for a job I applied to the week before. Since my layoff, I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about what I want next, and I finally think I have a clearer idea of what that is. While I was mostly over the fever by then, I still had some brain fog and pretty much bombed the interview. Oh, well. 

5:00pm I spent the rest of the day on my sister’s couch. I got an email rejection for a job I’d interviewed for the previous week that I agreed wouldn’t be a good fit for me.

*Wednesday, June 26th:*

8:00am I woke up at my sister’s house feeling good besides a small headache. I took some ibuprofen.

2:00pm My sister and I hit the road. Our first stop was Newport, Rhode Island, where one of my friends from college lives.

5:00pm We arrived in Newport. We got drinks before dinner; I got a club soda and my sister paid. We got dinner with my friend and split the bill. When visiting friends, I like to either treat for something or bring a small gift—we’d brought a candle and matches. **$39.68**

8:00pm We went to another bar after dinner. Still not wanting to drink after just recovering from being sick, I got a non-alcoholic beer. **$11.00**

*Thursday, June 27th:*

8:00am We woke up. My friend had already left for work, and my sister and I got breakfast in town at a cute cafe. I paid for both of us. **$19.17**

10:00am We walked the Cliff Walk and then hit the road. We stopped for coffee and lunch; my sister paid.

1:00pm We stopped at Newport Vineyards since we were on the hunt for Sakonnet candles (a Rhode Island candle company), but they were out. Instead, we bought a bottle of wine (their house white, which I’d tried on my last trip to Newport and enjoyed) to bring to our aunt and uncle’s house. I paid. **$18.00**

4:30pm We arrived at the shoe store my cousin works at in the Boston suburbs. I bought two pairs of sneakers, one for running, and one for walking. I live in New York City and walk a lot—sneakers are a very necessary expense. **$269.90**

6:00pm We went out to dinner with our cousin. He paid for dinner, but I paid the tip in cash. **$20.00**

8:00pm We headed to our aunt and uncle’s house in a nearby suburb.

*Friday, June 28th:*

7:30am I went for a run with my aunt and my cousin. Free, and priceless. It felt great in my new sneakers I’d bought the day before.

9:00am My sister and I took our cousins to the beach. We got a free parking pass from the library. Afterwards, we stopped for lunch and coffee. My sister paid for lunch and I paid for our coffees. **$20.53**

12:00pm I applied for a couple jobs quickly on my phone and got a rejection email from the interview I knew I’d bombed on Tuesday. I decided not to worry about that for the rest of the vacation and enjoy the trip.

2:00pm We walked to a local farmstand (so New England) to pick up vegetables for dinner. I paid. **$3.50**

6:00pm We went to a local brewery after dinner. I bought a drink for my sister and I, plus used some quarters to play pool with my cousins. **$20.00**

8:00pm We went to another brewery. I paid for my sister and I’s drinks. **$19.20**

*Saturday, June 29th:*

9:30am We hit the road heading north (queue up Noah Kahan). We stopped for gas; my sister paid. Then we stopped for breakfast and coffee; I paid. **$29.88**

1:00pm We stopped at Target and picked up some more snacks for the road. My sister paid. Then we stopped at Allagash Brewery (one of my favorite breweries!) in Portland, Maine. I got two small beers. **$13.61**

1:30pm We picked up some gifts on the way out of the brewery—one shirt for a friend, beer for our dad, a magnet for our cousins we planned to see later in the trip, beer for another cousin we planned to see, a shirt for my sister’s husband, and a shirt for myself. I paid for two shirts and the beer. **$84.90**

4:00pm We arrived at our cousin’s apartment farther out in Maine. We went out for dinner and drinks with other cousins who lived in the town; my sister paid for most of mine, but I bought her a drink at the last bar. **$10.00**

*Sunday, June 30th:*

9:00am We had a slow morning and went out for coffee and breakfast. My cousin paid.

11:00am I went for a run in my cousin’s neighborhood. It was hot, and I sweat a lot, but the shoes were still feeling great.

1:00pm We went for a local hike and noted that we’d definitely need bug spray for our hike the next day at Acadia. On the way back, we stopped at Chipotle for lunch. I paid for all three of us. **$32.35**

4:00pm We had a lazy rest of the day at my cousin’s apartment, knowing we would be getting up early the next day to head to Acadia National Park. I worked on my monthly reset post for Substack, which I scheduled to publish the next morning.

*Monday, July 1st:*

7:00am We left for Acadia National Park early. We picked up bug spray on the way. We also stopped at Dunkin’ and I got iced tea and hash browns. **$5.16**

8:30am We got to the Visitor’s Center and I paid for parking and our national park pass. **$35.00**

9:00am We caught one of the free shuttle buses around Acadia and went for a 4.4 mile hike. PSA: if you’re hiking Acadia, skip the Beehive hike for Champlain Mountain instead.

2:00pm Exhausted, we caught a free shuttle bus back into Bar Harbor and got lunch. I paid for my smoothie and sandwich. **$28.06**

4:00pm We got back to my cousin’s apartment and had a relaxing night. We ordered dinner in; I paid. **$54.93**

*Tuesday, July 2nd:*

8:00am We got breakfast and coffee at a place in town. My cousin paid.

10:00am My sister and I hit the road heading back south. We picked up a bottle of wine at a liquor store in New Hampshire (no sales tax!) and lunch. The wine was planned to be a gift for our cousins we were heading to next (theme of this vacation: visiting lots of cousins). I paid for lunch for my sister and I, and she bought us iced teas at Dunkin’. **$32.56**

3:30pm We got to my cousins’ apartment outside Boston and spent the night there. They ordered us dinner in, and we spent the evening hanging out with their kids (a toddler and baby).

*Wednesday, July 3rd:*

6:30am We woke up early, partially because we were used to early Maine sunrises, and partially because the toddler woke us up early.

9:00am We headed back south and stopped to pick up a birthday gift for our dad. We’d already gotten him a couple things, but wanted to get him some new shirts for running. I paid for the gift, and my sister bought us Starbucks. **$31.91**

11:30am We stopped for gas. My sister paid.

12:00pm We arrived at my parents’ house and promptly threw all our clothes from the hikes in the laundry. I went for a run in the neighborhood.

2:00pm We spent the rest of the day relaxing by the pool, and ate dinner in.

*Thursday, July 4th:*

6:00am I woke up and went for a run with my dad.

8:00am I had breakfast at home and spent the morning preparing for having more family over later that day. We spent most of the day in the pool with our extended family—and I didn’t leave the house, so I didn’t spend any money.

*Friday, July 5th:*

9:00am I packed up and got a ride from a family member to the train station. I took Metro North back to New York City and the subway home from Grand Central. **$16.90**

**Total: $831.89**

**Section Five Use this section to share how you afforded this trip.**

*How did you save up for this trip and for how long? Did you accumulate credit card debt for taking this vacation?* I didn’t save up for the trip; I pulled from savings for it. It ended up being a bit more than I usually spend in a week in NYC, but less expensive than other vacations where I've paid for hotels and flights.

It's really weird bc nothing else in the bag stinks it just smells like coffee but the camera stinks of rotten milk and it's so bad I can smell it just when I walk past the camera. I tried wiping down every part of the camera I could access with alcohol even inside the battery compartment and soaked the case in hot soapy water but they both still stink. I obviously can't find anything online bc this isn't a problem normal people have!! Does anyone know what I can do to get rid of the smell in the camera? I don't want to buy a new one bc this one is so special to me, but I might have to👎🏽

Also not sure if this helps but it's a canon powershot A630, if i have to I will take it apart and clean the inside I'm just unsure of what is safe to use to clean it or if there's an easier way.",1,1728407485.0,techadvice,0,1.0,False
1fz50u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1fz50u8/power_score_curve_real_section_october_summary/,Power score Curve + Real Section October Summary & Info,"Hey guys made a summary of the recent PowerScore October Recap detailing real sections and predicted curves. May or not be accurate but for your benefit.

This breakdown is based on the PowerScore LSAT podcast episode 159, discussing the October 2024 LSAT. The following are the real RC and LR sections identified, along with their associated curve adjustments:

Real RC Sections:
1. Vera Brittain, enrichment courts, keystone predators (+0.5)
2. German philosophy, Rakim and rap, action video games, neuroimaging in courts (0)
3. Architecture education, Malthus passage, brand values, Patricia Cowings space motion sickness (0)
4. Mayan civilization collapse, GMOs, Beckett being strict, intellectual property law (+1)
5. Galileo's mistake about Dante's Inferno, uncivil/civil disobedience, privatization of water use, Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide (+1)

Real LR Sections:
1. Elephants in domestication, Aristotle and education, supermarkets labeling, salt mineral licks, tomatoes as fruit/vegetable, Nile crocodiles (0)
2. George Orwell, bad scholarship, squirrels, hair pigment, Loch Ness monster, earth and moon origin, Shakespeare, orcas eating sea lions, Egyptian dice, cougars eating bighorn sheep, scraping tools, pollinating low bush blackberry bushes (+0.5)
3. Food trucks, marine fossil records, gas tax and farmers, bending of light and theory of relativity, money for electric cars, blood glucose and memory (0)
4. Ancient charcoal writing in caves, insulin and oats, bread and health and myopia, Earth's ozone, caffeine in coffee grounds vs tea, salmon and insecticide, bullfrogs and ponds leaping, cereal brand executives (0)

The baseline curve is -7 for a 170 score. Your personal curve is calculated by adding the adjustments from your RC section and two LR sections to the baseline. 

Additional info: An experimental LR section with ""mini logic game"" style questions was reported but not scored. Scores will be released on October 23rd. PowerScore predicts more formal logic and conditional reasoning questions in future tests.

I started a week ago and so far my coworkers seem to dislike me and get easily annoyed if I have questions, ignore me when I say good morning, make it a point not to include me in conversations, etc. I'm pretty introverted and struggle to relate with my coworkers because they like media that I don't know much about (Love Island, Taylor Swift, sports, stuff like that). My store's bakery and coffee/juice bar are connected so they usually stick me at the coffee bar by myself with minimal training and if I get behind on orders they refuse to jump in and help. They'll just watch or grimace/roll their eyes if I ask them for help. Do I just need to ride this out until I'm no longer considered the annoying new girl?",7,1728407446.0,wholefoods,7,0.89,False

Since I was a teenager I've had issues with falling asleep all the time and my energy being low all the time.  I have fallen asleep on the bus, train, in anyone's car, even on nights home in a taxi once or twice.  I fall asleep quite quick, I swear I can have short small dreams even in the space of about 10 mins.  I don't eat tonnes of crap, in fact I try my absolute best to eat a healthy balanced diet.  I also find things like caffeine be it from coffee or the odd red bull does absolutely nothing.  I am not the most active.  I take a walk when I can and I work in a café where I'm on my feet all day.

I've been to my doctor before about this but the first few times I went as a teen is wa just boiled down to ""hormones being all over the place"". I went back as an adult and she gave me sleeping tablets, with the idea that maybe a solid night's sleep would eliminate any day-time excessive sleepiness.  They didn't help at all.

Is it worth going to a Sleep Clinic to see if something can be done for me or is my lack of energy simply just from being in work all day and being genuinely tired.

It was a warm Thursday in May. As I exited the cafe two blocks away from the park, it may have been around 11 a.m. I began my daily stroll to the park with my order of a medium oat milk mocha swirl latte, no sugar, and a sausage, egg, and cheese muffin. I walked down the busy streets, noticing the same little things I do every day: people on their phones, brushing and bumping into people without a single apology.   I wish I could help them, but they are just so far gone.  They do not notice the beauty of this town, the beautiful decorations in the windows of the little shops down the strip. They miss the summer breeze in the whistling trees.   



	I wish I could say I noticed these things, but every man is damned by his vices.  However, my vices aren’t my phone or cheap pieces of plastic worth $200 in my ears blasting music.  My vices are judging people.  When I sit down on my favorite bench at my favorite park and eat my favorite lunch.  My favorite thing to do is watch the people stroll through.  I personally love noticing the unique things every soul carries through the park.  For example, at 11:57 every weekday, a young lady with short red hair and bright pink headphones storms by with the same emotionless face.  Or how at 12:15 every day, an older gentleman finishes his jog by stopping at the bench about 20 feet to my left.  He always gives me a nod as he jogs past.  



	I sit at this bench every day from around 11:35 to around 1:30. I have never encountered anyone else on this bench, and I have never had to tell anyone to leave so I can sit.  Today was a beautiful day. White, puffy clouds filled the bright blue sky over the park.  The late spring-early summer breeze cried through the towering trees as I began to sip from my coffee.  I place the sandwich to the side as I look straight ahead at the main path through the park.  The first person I noticed today was a gentleman in a crimson-red Harvard crewneck with a rare sight to see: wired headphones. I didn’t see the device it was connected to, but to see such a young man use what any youthful person would consider almost stoneage technology was awe-inspiring. 



It took me an estimated 4 minutes to see two people walking and talking together.  It was a middle-aged couple.  They held hands through the meadow part of the park.  Smiles covered their wrinkly faces as they enjoyed the beautiful day.  That is one thing that always turns my stomach in a different way.  Love.  I’ve done this long enough to see real love and love that will sadly dissolve.  My worst trait is the feeling I get when I notice fake love.  I should feel upset and bad for the people, but I don’t.  I feel happy and at ease knowing I am not the only one missing out on love.  



As if on cue, a couple aged... I don’t know. Maybe 25 and maybe 28 walked by.  They were not holding hands, and the beautiful young lady with her curly blonde hair was glued to her phone, catching the breeze in the perfect ways.  The poor gentleman walking beside her was trying to talk to her, but she was not listening.  They walked out of sight and eventually out of each other's lives if I had to guess.  



Directly in front of me, a mother walked by with her toddler.  The toddler, a little girl, stopped at my bench and complimented my eyes.  Rarely have I ever been complimented by strangers, especially at the park. One time, a redheaded woman sat down and talked to me about music when she saw I was wearing an old Fleetwood Mac T-shirt. But besides that, this little girl, in her bright pink tutu and purple shirt with a bright yellow bow in her hair, had done something I had never experienced.  I politely thanked the girl with a cheerful smile, then turned towards her mother, who looked down proudly at her sweet daughter and said.  “Isn’t she just the most precious little princess?” The mother nodded without a verbal response, then motioned goodbye as she tugged on her daughter's little arm and dragged her down the pathway.  



My mood had immediately changed, and I had already begun seeing the day differently. Little did I know what was to come in just fifteen minutes. But before that, the sun got brighter, the breeze got cooler, the trees hummed louder, and the grass was greener than on any other day I had the tremendous pleasure of experiencing.  I noticed the smiles on the faces of those passing.  I stopped looking for the negatives and just noticed the positives of this beautiful life.  The birds whistled a melody more beautiful than any human could ever compose.  



As the sunbeams reflected off my smile, a shadow was cast over me. Chills shivered down my back as my sunny world was cast in darkness.  I turned my head in a swift motion to see the most beautiful and elegant person to ever step foot in this park.  We held eye contact for what seemed like an eternity.  In that beautiful eternity, I saw everlasting love, memories to share on my deathbed, 12,783 sunsets, and 12,784 sunrises.  Our matching smiles cross miles of land as I am broken from my trance by their angelic voice. 

	

“Hey, Mind if I sit?” The stranger said, maintaining their eye contact. 

“Ug..Ugh…Ugh... Sure, go ahead.” I muttered in confusion.  

	

They walked across the bench and sat next to me, leaving just enough space for it not to be awkward.  This beautiful stranger chose my bench out of the exact 2,354 benches in this beautiful park.  The beauty that had already been exaggerated with my mood change has now transformed beyond my compression.  I had never felt this feeling before. I can’t describe the fluttering in my stomach. It isn’t a nervous reaction or anxiety but what I can only describe as love.  I had never believed in love at first sight or any romance trope hallmark throws at me, but the moment I turned my head, all those ideals vanished from my head.



I watched a bird land on a tree branch where a smaller, duller bird had already been perched.  The Universe has never been subtle with its signs, but this caused a chuckle that I couldn’t keep in.  As my croaking laugh exited my mouth, my left hand raced to cover the noise but couldn’t make it in time.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed this stranger begin to chuckle as well.  Did they notice the birds?  Are they experiencing the same feelings?  Or am I just a fool laughing at myself in a park?



I turned to share the smile with them as they lowered their hand from their mouth, revealing the same shining smile I had fallen for just moments ago.  They reached out their hand and said something along the lines of “My name is…” Sorry, I’m drawing a blank. The smile was taking up all my attention span until I noticed they were talking. My memory picks up with, “It’s nice to meet you. Do you come to this park often?  I am new to the area for school and trying to find places to study.” I sat fully up to respond and looked at them with another small laugh.



“I actually come here every day, and this park is very beautiful.”

“I can see why; I just went for a short walk, and now I am in absolute awe at the view, "" they said, looking up at the whistling trees. 

“It certainly is one of the best views in town,” I said nervously, looking out towards the horizon.

	

	We both chuckled at my apparent awkwardness and then stopped to gaze once again into each other's eyes. This time, I saw the crying waterfalls casting a rainbow over their cliffs.  A dozen walks through a fall apple patch.  Running hand in hand in the rain and a beautiful snowy night in a cabin on a frozen lake.  Now I knew their feelings paired with mine.  They stuttered through their next question, which they must’ve built the courage to ask while I imagined our coming years. 



“Do you, uhm, Do you mind showing me your other favorite areas…around town sometime?”

“Oh!” I said, a gut reaction. 

The next thirty seconds of my life were the most important I will ever experience. When I finally decided to ask them, thoughts on what to say raced through my jumbled mind. I shook my empty coffee cup and asked them.



“Hmm… I seem to be out of coffee.  I could go show you my favorite cafe. It is only two blocks off the path.”

	Their face lit up like our future Christmas decorations, and they began to jitter in the most adorable way. They responded with a simple…

” Do they have green tea?” 

“Of course they do, and it’s amazing!!” I said, fully aware that I had never had a sip of green tea in my life. But at that moment, it became my favorite drink. 



	I stood up from the bench and motioned towards the direction of the cafe.  They followed my action, and now, the bench that just sat two people, who were now destined for eternal gracefulness, sits empty and lonesome.  We made our way down the path, walking merely inches apart.  The bench watched us as we became eye candy for whoever would take on my role.

Different than the ones I usually have. You guys probably understand. I know the difference in my migraines between weather ones, and oops my hairtie was too tight, I went into direct sunlight for a minute too long, I didn't sleep well, I haven't had enough coffee.... I know how each of them feel. But this one hasn't felt like any of my usual ones. It's been painful from between my shoulder blades though the top of my head, my right temple my more than my left, but not NOT on the left. Pressure behind my ears, burning eyes. Swollen/drooping right eye (happens sometimes, one of my coworkers now proudly proclaims when she can ""see"" my migraines through this dropping eye).  Light sensitivity. Sound irritation more than sensitivity. And some mood changes and nausea. None of those symptoms are *new*, but that have felt different as I said in the beginning of this post.

All that being said, since day one of the migraine, my head has been periodically twitching pretty aggressively to either the right of left. This is new. I feel like I've had this sensation in the past, but never for this long, and never this noticable. Not noticable enough that I had never really put it together as a symptom until this attack. It is happening involuntarily. It's kinda like the voluntary movement of shaking your head to the side when you have a hair tickle the inside of your ear. Just an inch of two to one side in a rapid motion (goes both ways, but only one direction at a time not like shaking my head).

Just curious if any of you also carry this symptom during any of your attacks? I'd love to hear if you guys have any experience with this because it's bothering me quite a bit. I'm thinking about trying to film myself for a bit to try to catch it on film... But I'm also really hoping it'll stop any minute... For all 8 days. Lol",1,1728406981.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

Before my days of SR I'd be going to sleep past midnight every single night, wake up groggy and tired asf, and I'd have no dreams the whole night like it would just be a black screen. I used to think this was normal for everyone people would say things like I'm so tired right now I haven't had my morning coffee. Everything changed when I quit caffeine and went on SR.

**DREAMS**

The government doesn't want you to dream so they put a shit ton of fluoride in your tap water and toothpaste, and then get you addicted to porn and masturbation which all of these combined will calcify your pineal gland and then stop you from dreaming. Ancient egyptians knew how powerful the pineal gland was. I strictly avoid toothpaste with fluoride and drink filtered water, combine this with SR, you will experience literal movies every night when you go to bed, my dreams are so vivid nowadays I'll sometimes recall a memory and think oh wait that was just a dream, I can literally remember dreams I had 2 days ago in full detail, dreams teach you a lot of lessons because it just plays out what's going on in your subconscious mind, very powerful stuff.

1fz4n0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMoreStress/comments/1fz4n0r/my_experience_with_the_usda_organic_nootropic/,My Experience with the USDA Organic Nootropic Focus Supplement [Reddit Review Certified],"Hey everyone. I wanted to share my thoughts on the **USDA Organic Nootropic Focus Supplement with Ginkgo Biloba** that I've been using for the past few weeks. 

As someone who often struggles with focus and sometimes feels overwhelmed by daily stressors, I was curious to see if this supplement could help [(See Price On Amazon)](https://www.supplement-hero.com/usda-stress-relief-supplement). 

Here's what I found:

Benefits

**1. Aid to Calm Your Nervous System**  
One of the standout features of this supplement is its ability to help manage stress. The blend of adaptogenic herbs is great for easing those nerves, and I have definitely felt calmer while using it. I've noticed an improvement in my overall mood, which has been a pleasant surprise.

**2. May Enhance Ability to Focus**  
Instead of reaching for another cup of coffee to get through work, I decided to switch to this supplement. Holy moly, what a difference. I can honestly say that I've experienced enhanced focus and clarity during my tasks. It's like my brain has finally decided to cooperate.

**3. Proprietary Blend of Organic Herbs**  
The ingredients list really caught my eye. It combines several powerful herbs like **Ginkgo Leaf, Rhodiola Root**, and **Gotu Kola Herb**. Knowing that I'm putting organic, non-GMO ingredients into my body gives me peace of mind.

**4. Easy-to-Take Liquid Drops**  
I love that this supplement comes in liquid form instead of pills. It's super easy to take, whether you go with the recommended 30 drops directly or toss it into a glass of water. No more choking down hard-to-swallow capsules.

Who Is This For?

This supplement is perfect for anyone looking to improve focus without the jitters associated with caffeine. It fits into various lifestyles since it's **vegan, gluten-free**, and **dairy-free**. Plus, it's made in a GMP facility, so you know it's produced with care.

A Few Considerations

While I've had a positive experience overall, there are a couple of things worth mentioning:

**- Taste**: The flavor isn't the most pleasant (a little herbal), but it is manageable. If you mix it with water, it's not too bad.

**- Sensitive Users**: If youre sensitive to supplements, you might want to start with a lower dose and see how your body reacts before ramping up.

# Final Thoughts

So far, I'm really happy with the **USDA Organic Nootropic Focus Supplement**. 

It's been a fantastic addition to my daily routine, helping me to stay calm and focused. 

If you find yourself reaching for caffeine way too often or just feel bogged down by stress, I highly recommend giving this natural alternative a shot.

1fz4lo9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fz4lo9,Switched to A1 mini,"I recently upgraded from an Ender 3 to the A1 Mini, and I have to say, I regret not going for the full-sized A1! The results have completely blown me away. This is my first long print, which took around 25 hours of consistent printing. I ran the 6+ hour plates overnight and finished the smaller ones during the day.

I’m sure I could have printed this in my Ender but I have been having so many issues tuning it “properly” that it just wasn’t worth my time (100% user error and my fault). Also the amount of money I spent on upgrades for it I could have just bought the A1. The Ender is a good printer for learning and tweaking and it did teach me so much about proper heating, calibration and most importantly patience. But I should have just stopped being cheap and bought the A1 right off the bat. Hindsight is always 20/20 though!

Anyways, I’m thrilled with how it turned out! I know that with a bit of fine-tuning and slower print speeds, the quality could’ve been even better, but I’m more than satisfied with the outcome.

So here it is my Pip-boy 3000 Mark IV. It still needs some paint on the back side and some cushion for the wrists but it came out great! I used anycubic pla in grey and black along with some krylon matte coffee bean paint. I did some light sanding and wood filler for some of the gaps. The phone I have in their is an older one plus 5t running an app called pip droid for android. It’s so much fun and has a ton of different options and music from fallout!

I originally printed this for a Halloween contest my family holds, but now I think this has sparked a new passion for cosplay. I can’t wait to get some photos in full costume with my new Pip-Boy!

I'm a 40F looking for advice about a 40M.  He expressed frustrations about how difficult dating is for men similar to what a lot of Redditor men seem to say so I figure this is the perfect community to maybe provide insight on his behavior.

We matched on Hinge and also Tinder and went on a first date for coffee.  He asked me on a second date while we were still on the first.  He picked sushi for the second date which I took as a really good sign he liked me and was trying to make a good impression on me.  We spent 5 hours together talking on the second date.  (We went for a walk and to a bar after sushi.)  He suggested a third date while still on the second date but we didn't finalize any plans.  I thought it was going really well.  However, it was him who pointed out it was getting late and ended the second date and he did not kiss me when we said goodbye.  He stared at me and I felt like he wanted to but I was nervous and probably not giving off very inviting vibes and it didn't happen.  I feel like I was friendly but failed at being flirty throughout the date. 

I'm looking for a serious relationship and really trying to take things slow... And also just shy/awkward about dating in general.

I sent him a text when I got home saying I had a good time and he didn't respond until the next morning.  We exchanged a few texts that day and I sent a really boring text asking some more mundane getting-to-know-you type questions because I couldn't think of anything more interesting and he never responded.  That was three days ago.

(I think there's some irony in that he opened up to me on the second date about how hard dating has been for him and that he's gone to therapy and then ghosted me the next day.)

I guess the most obvious explanation for his not responding is that he decided after the second date that I'm not what he's looking for and/or he met someone else, and I should accept this with grace and not contact him again.

BUT I have this agonizing concern that he did like me and he stopped responding because it felt to him like there was no chemistry.  I was giving off very ""friendzone"" vibes but the truth is the exact opposite.  I've actually been fantasizing about sex with him since before I even met him just based on liking his smile in his pics and it was even worse once I met him in person.  I've barely been able to concentrate these past two weeks because my mind always drifts to imagining hooking up with him.  However, I don't think he'd even suspect I'm attracted to him based on my second date behavior.  

So anyway, I want your advice on whether I should accept the rejection and leave him alone...  I mean, I literally sent a text with questions and he never answered.  He's made it pretty clear he's not interested.

Or should I send some kind of follow up message...? And if so, what would I even say?  

I'm also hesitant whether I should want to see him again if I'm right that I bored him by not being flirty enough or kissing on a second date.  Maybe that's a red flag in itself?  But at the same time, it's valid for him not to want to waste time on dates that do not feel like they're moving in the direction of romance/sex.  Really interested to hear everyone's perspectives on this.  Thanks!",0,1728406367.0,datingoverforty,15,0.5,False
1fz4jk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1fz4jk0/october_nights_part_two_an_empty_chair/,"October nights, part two; an empty chair","Freya jerked the curtains closed immediately, pulling some of the plastic hooks off the rail as she did. She threw herself back into the bed and yanked the white covers over her head. Her phone was underneath her, she pulled it out and stared into its brightness, like its light was a tether to safety.  


   What she had seen, that figure, wasn’t real. As a child, she had been so utterly terrified by her own imagination that she would wet the bed frequently. She would believe with every fibre of her being that something with teeth was clinging to the ceiling in the hallway, just outside her bedroom. She could almost hear her eight-year-old self sobbing in fear beside her, and resented it. She had come so far since then, hadn’t slept with the light on since school. And she refused now to believe that sobbing child. 

She would not entertain the idea that she had seen anything at all on Mount Pleasant Drive. It was easier to think that what she had seen owed to a trick of the light; a combination of the moon and the clouds distorting the street lights.

Still, she kept the covers over her head and clung to the phone in her hand. She felt like she daren’t peak outside and instead watched the battery life on her phone run out.

\*\*\*  


When Freya woke, her phone was dead. She rubbed at her eyes then plugged it in to charge. The curtains were kept closed and she sloped out into the hallway wondering what time of day it was.  
‘Morning?’ she tried and headed into the sitting room. In the light of the sun she saw that there was dust on the old floral sofas and even on the back of nana’s blue tweed chair.  
Nana was sat in the chair. And Freya could see her left shoulder moving, like she was doing something with her arm.  
‘My train back to uni is at nine tonight nana, is that okay?’ she said. Her nana made no move to respond. Freya looked down at the wicker coaster on the side table and at nana’s mug which was sat on top. The tea inside hadn’t been touched. A cold, white-ish film had formed over its surface.  


 ‘Nana, are you okay?’ Freya went around the chair and bent to nana’s eye level.  
‘What?’ she asked in a croaky voice, her eyes looked as if she had been pulled out of a reverie.    
‘Are you alright? Freya rubbed her nana’s arm, it was moving back and forth on the chair incessantly.  
‘What? Yes love. Don’t bother about me,’ nana said and looked quite frankly at Freya, like she used to do. She took in her appearance and then tutted softly under her breath.  
‘Look at the state on you,’ she said, ‘why don’t you go a run a brush through that hair?’  
Freya moved to flop on the sofa in protest but was halted by a knock at the front door.

\*\*\*

‘Is your nan in, love?’ Julie asked. Then pushed past Freya, into the flat. She took her coat off and pressed it into Freya’s chest, before heading inside.  
Julie had never shown any inclination towards like or dislike with Freya. In fact, she seemed to view her friend’s only grandchild in the same way one would view a lampshade; as an object that was not especially interesting but could occasionally be useful.  
‘Hello Julie, I’m fine thank you,’ Freya mumbled as she hung the coat up and swung the front door shut.  
‘Is it really that serious?’ Julie was saying as Freya entered the sitting room.  
‘Christ on a bike, man! It’s only a few sheep!’  
‘Sheep?’ Freya repeated, sweat pricking under her arms. Nana turned in her chair to look at Freya sternly.  
‘Oh, go on Freya!’ she admonished, batting a hand at her, ‘take my purse and go and get yourself a pop!’  
Freya assented. Sending her to the shop was nana’s time-tested way of getting Freya out of the flat.

\*\*\*

Only a few sheep. Only a *few* sheep. Julie’s words spun around Freya’s head as she sloped down the hill to the shop. Only a few sheep?

 The mountain was ahead of her. It was bright and busy, full of lorries coming from the quarry. They were loud, and they billowed dust clouds up and down Mount Pleasant Drive, covering the autumn colours with chalky white.  


Freya rubbed her arm, feeling silly in the light of the working day. She saw the butty van that had parked at the foot of the mountain for time immemorial was still there, serving the workers in high-vis vests.  


When the left turn to the shop came at the bottom of the hill, Freya paused. What if, when she went to the shop, the strange was man was standing there again?  She weighed her nana’s purse in her hand. It was heavy, and she wondered (not for the first time) if she could brain someone with it. Then a new thought occurred to her; could her nana?  
The child in Freya turned her head slowly, wincing as if she expected to find nana behind her, come to check she had not taken more change than was allowed. But she wasn’t there.  


 A car drove past and someone in a house to her right closed a window. Freya shuddered, then shook herself. She removed the strange thoughts from her head, and moved toward the butty van instead of the shop.

\*\*\*  
  


Freya clicked open the cap of her forty pence bubble-gum pop and let the blue liquid fizz down her throat. She enjoyed the over-sweet carbonated bubbles and how they scratched as they went down. The man working the butty van professed that it was his favourite too and smiled earnestly as he served her.  


  She stood and listened to the chatter amongst the workers around the van. Most talked of sports and family troubles, a few discussed the job and its changing nature. Freya looked up, past the trees, and focused on where the entrance to the quarry would be. It seemed to her livelier than ever. Truck after truck came from behind the trees, with bed-loads of rock. The bustle made her think that it was impossible for the figure she thought she’d seen last night to exist. There was no room for it in a modern world, where every inch of nature had been categorised and claimed. There was just nowhere for it to hide.  


It was curious however, that Freya had heard neither warning alarms nor blasting. Rock was flying out of the quarry like never before, but there hadn’t been a single blast. Not today, nor yesterday, when she thought about it. Then, when had all that rock been broken up?  


   She walked and sipped the pop slowly, considering everything. She knew people were talking about sheep dying, and yet no one around the butty van had remarked on it. The figure, well that was something she had all but written off as a fantasy. And as for nana, it was likely that Julie was just exaggerating. Nana just needed a few days to herself is all. So thinking, Freya resolved her conscious to boarding the train back to uni that night, and putting the stirred up memories and emotions back inside her.

\*\*\*

When Freya reached for the handle of the front door, she found it was already open. She moved inside the flat and found it was silent. When she popped her head into the sitting room, there was no one in there.  
‘Nan-‘ she went to call out but cut herself off when she caught sight of the hand written note on the coffee table.  


  ‘Gone out. Take yourself to the train station,’ it read. 

Freya looked down at her fist. She still had nana’s purse, how could she have gone out? She checked the ceramic dish on the kitchen counter and found nana’s phone still in it. There was no lock on the brick-like phone so Freya had a quick scan through. It looked like the most recent messages were texts sent to customers, advising that they still owed nana money. There were quite a few of them, and some of the names were familiar to Freya, like Sid from the allotments and June from the White Hart.  
 

 Freya took one of her nana’s winter coats from the airing cupboard and slung it over herself. Going off her only lead, she would make her way to the inn and see if her nana had gone up there to collect on what she was owed. She anticipated having to trek through mud and wind to get to the inn, but she would not leave until she knew her nana was okay.  


She stepped out into the autumn cold once again but was immediately thrown from her stride. The strange man from the shop was waiting outside for her. This time, he had two children with him.

I recently got myself a new moka pot and I was wondering why the taste was so different, much stronger with the new one. So I examined my old moka pot and noticed a piece of brown feathery material protruding from the sprout at the top. I take a look inside from the bottom with a flash light and see this mass of brown papery material clogging the sprout of my moka pot from inside. 

I dug it out, and turns out to be most likely pieces of a paper towel mixed with old coffee grounds, must have lodged it in there while I was cleaning it the very first time.

Blackout curtains stopped the early traces of sun from streaming in the windows, but the morning was relentless and light spilled under the door. She contemplated just rolling back over when a separate alarm on her phone played its cheery tune.
	
“Shit. I guess I need to actually be a person today.” 
	
Taking a breath to get ready, she threw the covers back and swung off the bed to start her morning. A quick hot shower and a fluffy robe later she almost felt alive again. The smell of coffee greeted her as she came downstairs, the benefit of always being the second person awake. 
	
A familiar scene waited for Lily in the kitchen. Samantha in an oversized t-shirt standing at the sink, rinsing dishes and loading the dishwasher. A steaming mug of coffee made perfect for her sat on the counter. Grinning, she tiptoed in, sneaking up behind her wife and slowly reaching out to grab her mug. Just as her fingers reached the handle a hand slapped them away.
	
“Nope, you know the price.” With an exaggerated sigh and a stupid grin, Lily leaned in to kiss her. They played this game every morning, and every morning she lost, much to the delight of them both. 
	
Lily took a long first sip and sighed contentedly. “Perfect, as always. Of course the view doesn’t hurt either.” Her hand shot out to land a quick smack on Sam’s ass. “Maybe we should open a shop. Bottomless Lesbian Coffee.” 
	
Lily laughed as she spun away from the playful backhand she knew was coming, but didn’t see the other hand heading towards her head. Sam grabbed her hair in a rough handful and Lily gasped, breath catching in her throat and knees almost giving out. 
	
“What do you mean? I have a bottom right here.” Sam whispered into her ear. “Isn’t that right Kitten?” Sam giggled as she nodded weakly, eyes half closed. “Good girl.” Sam kissed her gently on the cheek and let her go.
	
Lily took another sip as her breathing returned to normal, heart still pounding in her chest. “God you’re cruel, ya know that? I love it.” She finished her coffee as they prepared for their day. They were both fortunate enough to work from home, Sam as a media editor and Lily as a writer. Lily threw their shared playlist on a speaker and set it to shuffle as she opened the outline of the story she was working on currently.
	
Two hours later, the page in front of her sat nearly unchanged, mocking her lack of progress. Her mind kept replaying remembered snippets of her dreams from this morning, then taking those pieces and running off into fantasy. They all had one thing in common. She turned to Sam, making sure she wasn’t in the middle of something precise before speaking up.
	
“I blame you this morning for making this worse. I need to scratch the itch.”
	
Sam grinned and caught her gaze, a wicked look in her eyes. “We’re free Friday night, I’ll make plans.” Lily swallowed hard, it was only Tuesday. This was going to be a long week. 

_______________________________
	
Sam and Lily had met in college and were instantly inseparable, moving swiftly from friend’s to dating. No one they knew was surprised when they moved in together a few months into dating. 

Samantha had realized she was a lesbian early in highschool, one awkward fumbling night with a boyfriend planted the idea, a night of exploration with a female friend confirmed it. Lily on the other hand was bisexual. She found herself drawn to girls after a night of dares gone a little too far, but she never gave up on guys. Bouncing from girlfriend to boyfriend and back again until she met Sam. She always said women were much better, but there was something they just couldn’t replace.
	
It was a little over a year into Sam and Lily dating that Lily realized she was craving something more sexually, something that Sam wasn’t equipped to help with. Nervously, Lily brought up her concerns and was grateful to be met with understanding. Sam had always teased her about still liking men, but it was always in good fun. Lily was simply relieved to get the concern off her chest, so she was surprised a few days later when Sam came to her with a solution.
	
“You’re craving dick? Lets get you some.” She said cheerily, laughing at Lily’s jaw dropped look of confusion. Lily tried to stammer a response when she was cut off. “It’s something you want that I cant give you, but I want you to be satisfied, so let’s find someone who can give it to you. It’s just sex right?” 
	
Lily nodded and Sam continued, “One condition, I want to be there to make sure you’re safe. I don’t want to be involved or in the room, but nearby as a safety net.” Lily’s heart melted, she couldn’t believe this was happening. 
	
So it was a few days later Lily found herself in their apartment bedroom getting pounded by a guy from one of her classes while Sam was in the living room reading. What Sam hadn’t expected was how horny it would make her to hear her girlfriend getting railed, moaning and panting. She barely made it a chapter before she gave up on the book and slid her hand down her pants, bringing herself to multiple orgasms as she heard Lily get railed on the other side of the thin wall.
	
It was a few nights later, the pair slightly drunk in celebration of the end of the semester, that Sam admitted what had happened. Lily was again left speechless, sending Sam into a fit of giggles. Regaining her composure, Lily grinned with a wicked idea, leaning in to whisper in Sam’s ear. “Maybe next time you should watch.”
	
So it was a few months later, when Lily wanted to scratch that itch again, that Sam found herself seated in the corner of their apartment bedroom. She watched with nervous trepidation as Lily stripped slowly and sat back on the bed, beckoning their guest with a finger. Another guy that Lily knew from class, Sam thought his name was John, he had agreed under the condition of Sam getting to watch. When asked later John would laugh and say that getting no strings attached sex with one hot woman while her girlfriend watched and played with herself was anything but a difficult offer to take.
	
Sam’s nerves faded as he took Lily’s nipple in his mouth, sucking gently. She gasped and ran her fingers through his hair as he continued, his hand trailing down to start playing with her. Sam’s hand followed suit, slipping into her own panties as Lily’s breathing started quickening. Sam watched as John slid two fingers into Lily’s waiting pussy, her own fingers starting to circle her clit gently. Her speed increased as Lily went from breathing heavy and gasping to fully moaning her pleasure into the room. 
	
John continued his combined assault, pushing her closer towards her impending orgasm as she moaned beneath him. Sam watched him drive two fingers into her at a rapid pace, thumb rubbing across her clit, her nipple never leaving his mouth. Sam felt her own orgasm approaching and slowed herself, she wanted this to last. She watched raptly as Lily’s moan cut off sharply and her entire body tensed, shaking slightly before collapsing into the bed panting. John released her nipple and pulled his fingers from her slowly. He brought his hand towards her mouth and she opened, greedily taking the offered fingers in her mouth and sucking them clean. Sam gasped as she watched, this was new, but watching it sent pleasure through her like a jolt of lightning.
	
Satisfied, John pulled his hand free and positioned himself between her legs. Sam watched Lily’s face closely as he slid in and hilted himself in one thrust. Lily’s eyes rolled back in her head and Sam found herself moaning as she watched. John took her wrists in his hands and pinned her to the bed as he started to pound her. Lily’s moans joined the air and her breasts bounced with every hard thrust, but Sam couldn’t look away from her face, her fingers moved faster as she watched.
	
A few minutes of hard pounding and Lily was nearly at her second orgasm of the night, her legs wrapped around John’s waist pulling him as deep as she could every time he thrust into her. Sam was now fingering herself with abandon, her other hand pinching and pulling at her nipple. Lily’s moans cut off again as she pulled john in and held him there, her pussy clamping around him as she soundlessly shook. John grunted and emptied himself into her, his dick throbbing as it shot deep inside her. Sam’s moans were the loudest in the room as she hit her own orgasm. 
	
As Sam caught her breath, John pulled himself free and quietly slipped off to the bathroom. Sam looked at Lily panting on the bed, still trying to catch her breath and her senses as she came down from her orgasm. She found herself walking towards the bed and climbing on it softly.
	
Confused, Lily looked up at her. Sam looked hungrily at her girlfriend. “I want you.” Sam grabbed Lily’s hands, pinning them at her sides and swung her leg over her face. She lowered her dripping pussy onto Lily’s mouth and was delighted to feel Lily’s tongue begin running along her lips. Sam had never taken charge like this, and it lit a spark of something inside her. She rode Lily’s face with abandon and was surprised to find words tumbling from her mouth as she moaned.
	
“Good girl. Fuck you’re so good at this. You like me riding your face don’t you.” Her hips clamped down on Lily’s head as she came, throwing her head back and moaning. As she came down from her orgasm, she rose up on shaky legs. 

As she climbed off her girlfriend, a panting Lily looked up at her. “That was certainly something.”

Blushing, Sam started to stammer out an apology. “I-I’m sorry I don’t know what…” She was cut off by Lily sitting up and kissing her softly.

“I didn’t say I didn’t like it.” 

John’s voice from the doorway broke the moment. “Woah. I was going to take my leave, but after that show I’d be willing to beg if it meant another round.” He grinned stupidly. “If you want to, of course.”  He hastily added.

Lily opened her mouth to answer but was stopped by Sam placing a finger across her lips. Sam looked into Lily’s eyes as she spoke, gauging her reaction. “I don’t think my kitten has a choice, because I’d very much like to see that.” She emphasized the word ‘my’ as she gazed at Lily. “Isn’t that right, my Kitten?”

Lily groaned and nodded. Sam grinned and climbed off the bed, retreating to the chair she was in before. She watched and played with herself as John fucked Lily again, hard and fast, until they each reached their orgasm again. John cleaned himself again and then left, turning down their offer to spend the night with how late it had gotten.
Exhausted, Sam and Lily laid in their bed cuddling and reflecting on what they had learned tonight. Not only did Sam like to watch, she liked to be in control, and Lily liked to be her pet.

_______________________________

The rest of the week passed torturously slow for Lily. It didn’t help that Sam loved to tease her in any way she could; a quick kiss on the neck as she was distracted, a pinch and tug on a nipple, a hard smack on the ass, all accompanied by a giggle as Lily gasped. Sam was just fanning the flames that were already consuming Lily, her dreams made sure she started each day horny and aching for relief that her vibrator couldn’t bring.

As Sam shut her computer down at the end of the work day Friday, her heart was pounding. It was almost time, finally. Sam giggled at her nervously flitting around the house killing time. Catching Lily in a hug she gave her a deep kiss and asked. “Do you want to get ready, or do you want me to get you ready?”

Lily thought for a moment before answering. “I think im going to pamper myself, any more anticipation and I might die.” She emphasized this with an exaggerated face and her hand around her own neck, trying to ease her nerves and anticipation. 

Sam nodded and kissed her again, then pressed a soft bag into her hands.. “Enjoy yourself. Collar on when you come back out. Meet me in the bedroom.” 

Lily retreated to the bathroom, drawing herself a very hot bath and throwing in some oils and bath salts. She lit a few candles and lowered herself into the water gently. She let herself relax for a long while, melting into the bath until a timer on her phone chirped softly. She set about finishing her preparation, shaving everything then properly lathering and washing herself off. She moved quickly from the bath, drying herself off with a fluffy towel and brushing her damp hair. 

With a deep breath, she pulled her collar from the bag. She watched herself in the mirror as she put it on. The soft black leather sat against her skin comfortably, the tag at the front jingling as she fastened it tightly. She stared at the tag as she slowed her breathing. A silver heart with a single word engraved in flowing script. Kitten.

Stepping from the bathroom, she lowered her head and made her way to the bedroom. She entered and stood waiting for instructions, the scene had begun. Sam’s voice called out. “Aren’t you a pretty little kitten? Let me see. Present.” Her tone was soft but left no room for disagreement. Her wife was gone, replaced by her owner.

Lily dropped to her knees and spread her legs wide, giving full access to her crotch. Her hands went behind her back, each clasping the opposite elbow. Her chest puffed out, placing her tits fully on display. She shivered as she felt Sam’s hand trace over her smooth lips, cruelly circling her clit for just a moment. She bit back a gasp as the finger dipped lower and pushed slowly into her already soaked pussy.

“It looks like my little Kitten is in heat.” Taunted Sam as she fingered her slowly. Sam waited until Lily was panting and struggling to hold her pose before she pulled her hand away. “On the bed and on your back Kitten.”
 
Lily crawled over to the bed and climbed on as Sam continued. “Lucky for you I was able to find someone to help with that. Does my Kitten like that? A stranger I chose taking care of your needy little pussy? Maybe I wont even let you see them. Should I keep them a mystery” Lily nodded slowly and Sam chuckled, reaching for a blindfold. Lily shivered as it was slid over her eyes, plunging her world into darkness.

She knew it wasn’t a stranger, but it was the nature of the roleplay she be given up to some unknown man. After college they had stayed friends with John, finding they had a lot in common in interests and hobbies. He was in their wedding party when they got married, and they were in his when he married his husband Shaun a few years later. It was with his husband’s blessing that he played the role of hungry stranger when called upon. Unlike Sam, Shaun didn’t get involved, preferring to spend these nights alone with candles, wine, and a movie marathon. 

Sam took Lily’s hands and moved them to the head of the bed before fastening a leather cuff around each of her wrists. The cuffs were fastened together, then to the hook at the head of their bed, holding her arms above her head. She felt matching cuffs slide around her ankles, but instead of being fastened together each was pulled to the corner of the bed and hooked to the post. She unconsciously pulled against her new binds, feeling a bit of slack before they pulled tight with the clink of chains.

“Does Kitten want a treat before I bring in our friend?” Sam asked as she gently pet Lily’s head. Lily nodded and she felt the bed shift as Sam straddled her head. She felt Sam lower her hot pussy onto her face and dutifully began to lick, moaning at the taste of her owner’s arousal. Sam rode her face with abandon, and she never stopped licking. Her own pussy was flooding as she heard Sam’s moans get louder, then suddenly legs tightened on her head as Sam hit her first orgasm of the night.

Sam pulled off her face after she stopped spasming. “Good girl.” Her voice was shaky at first, but quickly regained its confident tone. She whispered in Lily’s ear as her hand grabbed a nipple and twisted. “Is my Kitten ready to get bred like a good girl?”

Lily moaned out her answer. “Yes please. Fuck! I need it.” 

She felt Sam’s weight leave the bed and heard the door open then shut again. Heavier footsteps approached the bed. A large strong hand grabbed her tit, groping her roughly. She gasped and his other hand clamped over her mouth. His hand muffled her moans as he played with her tits and nipples, making her squirm and pull against the cuffs. 

Warm heat enveloped an abused nipple as he took it in his mouth. His hand strayed down to her dripping pussy, thumb massaging her clit as he slid two fingers inside in one quick motion. His teeth grazed across her nipple as he sucked it greedily. His fingers drove in and out of her, curled slightly to brush across her g-spot on each thrust. His thumb never left her clit, massaging in little circles. Her body arched as he pushed her closer and closer to orgasm.

Sam had retreated to a plush chair in the corner of the room they had gotten just for this purpose. She slid off her clothes and grabbed a glass of wine as John began to play with Lily. She smiled and she started to play with her hardening nipples, matching the spirit of the scene in front of her if not the intensity. Her hand followed John’s lead and drifted down to her own dripping lips as he began to finger Lily. Her fingers moved slowly as she watched intently. Her initial need satisfied by Lily’s oral skills, she could be patient and enjoy the show.

Lily couldn’t take anymore, her body arching off the bed and pulling against the restraints as she screamed her orgasm into John’s hand. His fingers and mouth didn’t slow as he drove her further and further into her orgasm, until finally she slumped back into the bed. Sam finished her wine and reached for her vibrator as John positioned himself in between Lily’s legs. The main event was about to begin.

Lily felt the thick head of his dick split her lips and sit at her entrance, teasing her until she was ready to beg. She opened her mouth to beg but the words were cut off by a hand closing around her throat. He slammed into her in one powerful thrust. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she felt him split her apart. Her moans slipped past his grip on her neck as he started to piston into her.

Sam switched on her vibrator and pressed it against herself as she watched her wife get fucked like a ragdoll. She swung her legs open wide in the chair and her soft moans joined the sounds in the room. Lily couldn’t process anything but the hot cock driving into her needy cunt over and over again. She shook and pulled against the thrusts but the cuffs kept her exposed and open for him. 

Lily screamed out as her orgasm overtook her, but John kept pounding. She came down from her orgasm and was immediately started towards another as he used her like a toy. Sam moaned as her own pleasure mounted, switching the vibrator higher. John was grunting as he slammed into her, the hand that wasn’t pinning her neck to the bed grabbed roughly at her ass, pulling her into him with every thrust.
Sam called out as her orgasm approached. “That’s it, take that fucking like a good girl Kitten. You look so good with a big dick in you. I want to see you cum again for me Kitten. Let me hear how much you love being a hole for me to give out.”

The words cut through the haze of Lily’s brain and sent her screaming into another orgasm. Her pussy clamped down on John’s cock as she shook, sending John over the edge himself. He grunted as he slammed as deep as he could and unloaded his hot cum in her, her pussy milking out every last drop as she squeezed down on his shaft. Sam threw her head back and her moan cut off into a gasp as she hit her own orgasm, holding the vibrator against her clit as her legs slammed together.
Lily laid on the bed in a daze, barely noticing that John pulled out of her abused pussy and had left the room. She felt Sam undo the cuffs and slide the blindfold off her head. The room was softly lit, but she had to blink a few times as sight came back. She tried to sit up, but gave up and collapsed across Sam’s lap, exhausted. Sam gently pet her head, whispering sweet words as her senses returned. 

Lily didn’t realize she had started to doze until the sound of a door closing woke her up, still on Sam’s lap. John had finished showering and shown himself out, leaving them to their aftercare together. Sam helped Lily to her feet and into the bathroom. They showered together quickly then returned to bed. Lily nestled herself against her wife as they threw on a movie.

Sam held her close. “Did you enjoy yourself Kitten?” Lily nodded. “Good. Shaun named his price for this time. We’re in charge of snacks and pizza for board games next weekend.”

Lily chuckled. “Steep, but worth it. I love you.”

Sam kissed her head softly. “I love you too Kitten.”",1,1728405989.0,eroticashorts,0,1.0,False

I also feel so lost in life, I don't what I want any more or how to achieve the things I want to.

* **Black Gold**: using this for nights out, and it’s fire
* **Red Tobacco**: saved this one for special occasions, but I find it a bit strange and too smoky (maybe because I don’t smoke?). Not sure how I feel about it yet.
* **Aoud Vanille**: this is my go-to for date nights, and it’s perfect.

I was thinking of replacing **Instant Crush** with either **Hindu Kush** or **Sicily** for fall/winter, and for **Red Tobacco**, I’m considering **Mancera Black Prestigium**.

*Date:(Standardized Human Time)February 9th, 2161.*

Now that we've discovered that Bahumth developed a tic to trigger her hunger for blood, Dr. Sela said we now need to discover what triggers the tic itself.

So ever since we got home from the therapist, we started experimenting. The only problem was... The tic is triggered everytime Bahumth sees, smells, or even *thinks* of flesh, which was a problem because it resulted in her biting me on the paw so she could get at the slab of raw meat I had for dinner that day...

But, the good news was that we discovered what triggers her, the bad news is that not only did I have to bandage up my paw, but Dr. Sela also said that, once we found her triggers, we had to find substitutes for her to consume. Obviously, allowing her to continue her sanguinolence would be detrimental to her health. So in order to make sure she doesn't hurt anyone if she ever gets triggered, we need to find a blood-substitute for her instead.

Looking on the internet, I found many things that could work as substitutes. Many types of candies, drinks, foods, and other concoctions. Bahumth's favorites are black coffee and dark chocolate from Earth, which we got from local Yotul markets. Apparently Bahumth really likes bitter foods, which I thought was a little odd but I didn't want to sound judgy.

""Well, at least the house has regained *some* normalcy."" Vulthiss said as we ate in the kitchen.

""Well dear, that depends on what you define as *normalcy*."" I replied.

She lashed her tail in understanding. I felt glad that we were alone at the moment. Tanca and Bahumth were still asleep at the moment while Glis was out in the backyard hibernating while he charged in the currently setting sun.

""So, what should we do at the moment while we wait for everyone else to wake up?"" I asked Vulthiss.

She quickly inhaled what was left of her breakfast before her brow furrowed as she thought about an answer to my question.

""How about I just spend time with my soon-to-be consort?"" She said before getting closer to me. ""After all, I rarely ever get time alone with you since you go out to fight, or we both look after the kids.""

I mulled over her words, which surprisingly hit me with a melancholic wave. All she wants is to spend time with me, and yet I leave her scared and alone as I go into battles that I may never return from. And when we are together, we have to take care of our kids, so getting time to ourselves is a rare occasion... A rare occasion that I have to treasure with her.

""Well, how about I... Coddle you a little? After all, it's what you said you wanted."" I answered.

Her eyes lit up. ""Really?""

I slapped my tail in affirmative.

*(Several Minutes Later)*

We both were in bed. She was stretched out as she lied on top of me. Sure, she was heavy and put a lot of pressure on my lungs, but I didn't want to ruin the moment. Besides, she was really warm and soft.

We spent the last few minutes like this. I continued to gently stroke her back as I whispered ""If My Heart Was A House"" by Owl City to her. Though this act was in no way sensual, more like motherly. She let out a slight growl of affection as I sang to her while caressing her back. It felt like nothing else was real, that her and I were the only things that mattered, or even existed in the universe! And frankly, I had no problems with the feeling.

She gently licked my neck in affection, making me interrupt the song as I giggled. When I eventually finished singing to her, I felt happy. Not like the type of happy you get when you get the job you've always wanted, or spend time with your friends. No, I mean true, unadulterated, happiness. Like everything was peaceful, or like my life was at its greatest peak.

""Cthal? What's wrong?"" I heard Vulthiss ask, breaking me out of my thoughts and making me realize I was crying.

""Nothings wrong..."" I muttered. ""Nothing will ever be wrong again..."" I said to her.

I wrapped my arms around her, squeezing her body close to me. I prayed that if I held her tight enough that she and I would meld together so we can never be apart. I wanted to never be away from her again. If there is a divine being dictating the universe, I thanked them for giving me the greatest life anyone could ever have.",7,1728405365.0,NatureofPredators,0,0.9,False

I will likely feel something, but it's entirely possible that it will be very minor and not last nearly as long.  When I quit, I had tapered to a cup of half caff every day for about a week before that.

The thing that got me, which I take 100% accountability for, was trying to rush the process, and I tried quitting vaping 15 days in.  It was too much, and I was a fool to try to do everything at once.

I've tapered off Methadone 120mg/day, Benzos, Lyrica and CT'd amphetamines over the last two years, all successfully, I might add.  I've also gotten off of half a dozen psych meds, quit drinking soda and lost 55 lbs, quit social media (except reddit and youtube), and more.

I am also doing a suboxone taper.  I've successfully gotten down from 16mg/day down to 6mg a day and have been stable at that dose for a while now, and so, I just went to 4mg/day today.

I actually started tapering caffeine the same time as I went to 6mg/day suboxone, so I know I can handle both of those things together.  When I quit all those things, I got used to the fact that it sucks for a while, and then life gets so much better when you're out of the illusion.

I will keep on going and keep working towards a caffeine-free life.  It's entirely feasible to get there, and I have no doubt in my mind that I can do it!",1,1728405337.0,CaffeineFreeLife,1,1.0,False

We live on the northern coast of Oregon which is rather remote and isolated.  There are two scenarios causing us to consider a generator system:  1) The winter storms often knock power out for 1-4 days a few times each year.  2) We also have a rather significant ""doomsday"" scenario wherein an offshore earthquake *should* someday happen and *could* cause a devastating tsunami where we could be isolated for a very long time.  

Scenario #1 is what we are currently planning for - but with scenario #2 also in mind.  We are NOT trying to prep for a zombie apocalypse - rather we just want to be prepared to be able to keep our fridge and freezer from spoiling, make coffee, have some lights on, maybe watch a movie with the DVD player and possibly turn on a 9k - 12k BTU heatpump to take the edge off.  We can cook with LP via camp stove and BBQ.  We also have a house LP tank connected to a gas woodstove for supplement heat.  Generator criteria:  Dual Fuel (we prefer LP, nice to have gas as a backup option), Quiet, \~7k-9k continuous (9-11k peak).

Research to date has led us to consider installing an Interlock device in our panel connected to an exterior 50A outlet.  We would keep the generator in the garage along with a full 40lb LP bottle or two.  Then when the lights go out, we wheel the Genny outside, fire it up, select our circuits and all is good.

This post keeps getting randomly deleted for some reason... but I WILL have it up.

I wrote a post earlier looking at the flag + mic, fire, and crash emojis in context of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Sept. 18th. General sentiment was that rate cuts could be bearish for the market for a variety of reasons. We’re waiting to see if the flag has anything to do with the election, but the way world looks after November 5th will include the ripple effects of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Sept 18th. In the words of our CEO:

>”Low interest rates may prove to be like easy sex — tempting but possibly fatal” — RC on X, Oct. 11, 2022

The Fed’s next meeting on monetary policy is November 6-7.

😳 💩 😿 🥜 🐸 🍦 🤢 👍 👊 💀 🥸 👀 🤩 ⚡️ 🎮 🚀 🍄 💥 🍏 🤨 😵‍💫 💜 🫂 👌 🤝 ⛺️ 😼 🎯 👀 🐕 (🇺🇸🎶🎤) 👀 🔥 💥 🍻

TL;DR—

* The emojis and RC’s tweets indicate that the Japanese carry trade and the Fed’s interest rate policy are very important
* I hypothesize that 🍻 may be DFV timing a “reverse” market crash/melt up scenario
* Teddy Holdings will exist as an alternative to traditional Venture Capitalist/Private Equity funding— the ultimate brainchild of LC and RC
* Other things are more speculative, but still tied to current events…

Japanese carry trade, strength of dollar, other carry trades

* 🥸-💥 represents the time when RC was tweeting about the Japanese carry trade. 
   * 🥸 is “disguised face”. This is the tweet where RC put googly eyes over his face 👀. RC’s next tweet would be his very first female face swap. Scrolling down from here, each tweet has something specifically to do with either Japan, “carry”, or telling DFV where to look:
      * Japan related: 1) Sumo wrestlers 2) ☀️👍 sun rise 3) Mario Hockey 4) a bidet 5) chopsticks 6) “I heard Ryan doesn’t cry when stepping on Lego”, a typo that reads like a Japanese accent; 7) a lego GameStop building with an ape climbing up the side reminiscent of King Kong. The big movie that had just come out a few months earlier? 8) 🤩 Godzilla vs King Kong  (red Hollywood stars tweet, emoji has two red stars in DFV’s timeline)
      * Keys 1) 🐱+ “eew eew llams a evah I” telling DFV to look backwards 2) HOLD or HODL indicating the sumo tweet 3) it takes money to buy whisKEY 4) 🎶 telling him to look out for the only musical reference in the soundless Zohan tweet right below it 5) Principal MacKEY from South Park + the face swap right below it 
      * Carry related: Zohan “carrying” a girl on his shoulders in one scene & wearing a Mariah Carey shirt towards the end
* Current event: Japan just elected a new Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, in a surprise victory Sept. 30th. The market was apparently not pricing in his victory. He’s expected to allow the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates on the yen, which will strengthen the yen as the dollar weakens from the Fed’s rate cuts. 
* Based on how the initial unwind looked in August, I hope we’re in for a show. 

RC was telling us the whole time, DFV was just paying attention. You can see that in a Kitty that goes from 😿 to 👌 🤝. “[I had thought that at the time](https://x.com/theroaringkitty/status/1790762813868175516?s=42), but investment theses evolve over time…

Warren Buffett’s sale of Apple in 2020 as well as this year, an inflationary indicator?

* 🍏-🤨 represents a time when RC was tweeting about inflation
* “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree 🍏” could be in reference to Warren Buffett’s selling of Apple in 2024, before the Fed started lowering interest rates again.
* When I heard WB was selling Apple, I thought it felt familiar… In the 2nd half of 2020, Buffett sold over $10 billion of Apple. 
   * The Fed kept interest rates steady at 0.25% for 2 years, until March 2022.
* Buffett starts buying Apple again in January of 2022. By the end of Q1 2023, Buffett had bought over $4.2 billion worth of stock. 
   * From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates from 0.5% to 5.5%, where it stayed until the cut we just received last month, Sept 18 2024. 
* [This go round](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/aapl/transactions), he started selling in October 2023. In the first half of 2024 Buffett sold over $85 billion of Apple. 
* It was [widely reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cut-apple-investment-by-about-13percent-in-the-first-quarter.html) that Buffett had sold more Apple on May 4th at Berkshire’s annual meeting. DFV came back May 12th. 
* ⚡️ 🎮 🚀 🍄 💥 🍏 🤨 😵‍💫 
   * 🤨 comes from the tweet “Who will be the piñata for all this inflation?” RC actually made the piñata tweet before the apple tweet, so DFV is presenting this chunk of information in a certain order. 
   * This chunk reads: “from the crash that happened around the time of that Mario tweet, who would be the piñata for the ensuing inflation?”
   * The spiral eyes isn’t totally clear, but you could easily say Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of inflation dollars, and perhaps by way of carry trade.
      * Softbank is a Japanese holding company that acts as a proxy for all the big tech companies like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft. They invest in SoftBank, SoftBank “partners” with them. I’m pretty sure Softbank can help facilitate a carry trade as an issuer of foreign currency. You’ll see what monopolistic bullshit they just pulled in the DOJ section below. 
      * Nah fuck it I’ll just tell you now. Remember how Microsoft and Nvidia tried to acquire Open AI and the DOJ said [no](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/tech/ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation/index.html)? Guess who just invested half a billion into Open AI! [Softbank](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-at-157-billion-valuation-microsoft-nvidia-join-round.html)! I bet the DOJ *loves* that. 
      * Buffett famously does not own Nvidia

ARS Pharma 💉, Dreyfus, BNY Mellon 

* 👍-💀comes from the time RC made his Sears tweet with the S and the E getting knocked off the sign. I decided to look up “ARS Holdings” and the connections were surprising! 
* BNY Mellon just [reported](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-spry-sec-filing-2024-09-21/) an increase in their holdings of a company called ARS Pharmaceuticals on Sept. 21st. BNY increased its holdings by almost 100%, from 69,891 shares up to 139,285 owning \~0.14% of the company. The company was listed on Dec 4, 2020 right before the sneeze. 
   * BNY Mellon is also the owner of the Brazilian Puts
   * BNY Mellon also owns Dreyfus 
   * BNY settles trades for Citadel, especially repo market securities (treasuries, bonds)
   * BNY Mellon also has a friendly merger/acquisition relationship with Computershare… in an industry where they make up 2 of the top 5 competitors in their market… I’ll let you look into that on your own
* ARS Pharmaceuticals was  [reported](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/owning-30-shares-institutional-owners-131433242.html) as 30% institutionally owned in June, mostly hedge funds. This was before BNY’s recent increase.
* It was just reported a couple days ago that ARS Pharma is being investigated for securities fraud. Why?
   * This is where things weird. I don’t know exactly, but here’s what I saw on my journey:
      * If you Google News “ars pharmaceuticals” you get results for their FDA-approved nasal spray product mixed in with Law Firms saying the company is being sued for securities fraud. 
      * [This Law Firm](https://www.fox21news.com/business/press-releases/accesswire/922911/ars-pharmaceuticals-inc-is-being-investigated-for-possible-securities-fraud-and-investors-with-losses-are-urged-to-contact-the-schall-law-firm/) says: “The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. The FDA rejected the epinephrine nasal spray developed by ARS on September 19, 2023.”
      * It looks like ARS has been spreading information that their product is FDA approved, but that isn’t fully true. These law firms are looking for investors who suffered losses based on this misrepresentation to join a potential class action lawsuit. 
      * Timeline: ARS [responds](https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ars-pharmaceuticals-submits-response-fda-complete-response) to FDA request for more information on their product in April; ARS [officially](https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ars-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-approval-neffyr-epinephrine) says they have FDA approval in August; Class action ambulance chasers like the one above reminding people today that ARS didn’t complete the FDA approval process *September of last year*.
      * BNY looked at this company and said “let me own this”
* Some investment firm named China Universal Asset Management, who specializes in Chinese investments, also invested in ARS Pharma, a California company… weird!
* For ARS Pharma to matter, you would need to believe that RC was tweeting about this on June 3, 2021 💉

Teddy Holdings, holding companies in general

* 👍 👊 It’s almost as if ARS Pharma is being used as a holding company. Speaking of holding companies, 👍 👊 came right before an RC tweet from the movie Ted. RC would go on to incorporate Teddy Holdings LLC 3 months later. 
   * I don’t think they’re official communications from GameStop, but if you google Teddy Holdings, the first few results look and sound like they came from LC + RC. Teddy holdings dot com looks like it’s a friendly, wholesome holding company that invests in small businesses. 
   * The axial website has the following description: Teddy Holdings is a low-profile holding company modeled after Berkshire Hathaway. Our founder was a private equity investor at Apollo Global Management and launched Teddy Holdings to be a permanent home for great small businesses (vs the traditional PE model of buying-and-selling large businesses). 
      * That last part about being against “the traditional model” of raising money certainly sounds like it came from RC, who had a hard time raising money for his company that way. 
      * Their logo on this site is a goat and it says the company is headquartered in NY, which reminds me of the little New York cap on the painting of [Tylee](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1684016228938190848).
      * Does the pic under this section remind you of any tombstone tweeting CEOs? (I swear this has been found before)
* 🐸 🍦 the McDonald’s tweets stand out amidst his references to fallen companies like Blockbuster, Sears. The key to interpreting this tweet is by looking 2 below at the Ben Franklin pic— “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The famous McDonald’s story is that they took advantage of the 2008 housing crash to buy up real estate. The ounce of prevention was that they had the cash available to do so. The pound of cure is all the revenue their investments generated which helped them thrive while other companies struggled.
* Current event: the Apollo Global Management mention is interesting. (Apollo just bought) around $3 billion worth of Deutsche Bank debt in SRTs. I’ll be monitoring Apollo and Deutsche while researching their pre-sneeze situations a little more.

Will we see a “reverse market crash”? 

* 🍻 If there’s one thing DFV is good at, it’s timing the market.
   * If there’s another, it’s making memes.
* I’ve been thinking about a reverse market crash, where the Fed lowers interest rates to try and save a falling economy, which is essentially printing money just for the money to flow away from the broader economy and into stocks. The dollar becomes cheaper, banks borrow the cheap money, spend it on assets— the prices of those assets go up, but the dollar is still cheap, it can’t suddenly buy a more expensive thing. 
* The result of a reverse market crash is a “melt up” where the flow of inflation dollars causes stock prices to rise at the same rate the dollar loses its purchasing power. 
* I believe DFV could time the effect of an interest rate decision that causes a “melt up” in GME, but he would need to be able to pinpoint how exactly inflation dollars would make their way to GME. Banks and institutions have thus far not bought into GME. Perhaps that will change when things crash and GME/Teddy can do its Berkshire/McDonald’s thing. 
* The Argentina stock market has experienced a melt up since 2020. Puts the President Milei tweet into perspective. 🇦🇷👍

The upcoming fire and crash, DOJ regulatory perspective 🔥💥

* On top of unwinding these carry trades, the DOJ has been going after a lot of monopolies recently, which represents a lot of money in the markets. Within the last few months:
   * DOJ starts probing Nvidia
   * DOJ investigates Microsoft as well as Nvidia for investments in AI
   * DOJ wins a suit against Google for its search engine monopoly 
   * DOJ sues Apple for its smart phone monopoly
   * DOJ investigated and sued rental housing monopolies for algorithmic price fixing
   * Senate Committee on Homeland Security investigates Citadel in connection with a report on Hedge Fund Use of AI, warning of an upcoming crash caused by AI.
   * DOJ sues Andrew Left which probably spooks the other 30 hedge funds and short sellers they’re still investigating, including Citadel, Melvin, and Hindenburg.
      * You’ll know the DOJ is about to sue when you hear that a warehouse just caught fire.
   * Senate probes Kroger for their use of a pricing algorithm
* That is a fuck ton of money represented by monopolies that I won’t calculate. And that’s leaving out most of the other investigations DOJ has going on. These DOJ investigations are a liability on the balance sheet of the entire market. 
* My feeling is that the DOJ will want to pick up the legal process on Citadel before the election, just to have something going in case the next president has a radically different Antitrust agenda
* You should find it hard to believe that NOTHING was done about the buy button being turned off in ’21, yet regulators want to start acting on all this other shit now. Just like how we think everything in the market sort of revolves around GME, I think everything the DOJ is doing in Antitrust has to do with building a case against Citadel et al. Of particular interest to me is the DOJ’s suit in the rental housing market for algorithmic price fixing. 
   * This is America establishing legal precedent for the first time ever applying laws against monopolistic behavior to the use of algos/AI. 
   * I know that Citadel + others also use algorithm machines to control GME and the rest of the stock market, so I believe the DOJ will use the outcome in the rental housing case to say “Here’s what makes an algo machine illegal. Here’s how Citadel’s algo systems break the law we just established.”
   * **Theory: the algo is not testing for liquidity, it’s testing for price.** If it has Citadel’s MM + AP privileges, then it already has access to infinite liquidity. They’re looking for buyers and sellers, which does not necessarily require a certain number of shares. Foundational DD suggests 1) GME price is algorithmically controlled; and 2) the algorithms are not built to account for the total universe of shares that actually exist in the market. 
      * [PWN DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qx8yyu/the_algorithm_the_ouroboros_part_21_exposing_hf/) showing price is algorithmically fixed
      * [Leavemeanon DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8t9n/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_3/stating:) stating: “they’re coded to look for profits… I don't know if there's a parameter than accounts for all the shares sold, trading, and collateralized on the books with derivatives that build up over time as excess supply.""
      * [Senate report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024.06.11-Hedge-Fund-Use-of-AI-Report.pdf) on hedge funds talks about how algos operate on an “if-then” basis without much regard to the wider effects of their behavior. See flash crashes caused by the triggering of algos, aka “herding”
* **Basically, I’m looking for interest rates, DOJ investigations, or algorithmic herding behavior to cause**

Two non-emoji things

Citadel’s RICO thing

* I find it interesting that this [RICO suit](https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20240722la66814/bankruptcy-trustee-joins-debt-holders-of-glorifi-to-pursue-alleged-saboteurs) against Citadel, brought by a private company, was announced at the same time the [DOJ filed charges](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/26/andrew-left-charges-doj-sec-short-seller) against Andrew Left & Citron. 
* [The suit](https://www.wfaa.com/article/money/billionaires-feud-bankrupt-anti-woke-dallas-bank/287-7cda5a3a-d081-48ac-ad4f-2ec326c84307) names Citadel as well as founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts as defendants 
   * Hide yo kids hide yo warehouse 🔥
* The suit comes from the guy who created GloriFi, an “anti woke” banking start up which aimed to provide a conservative alternative for investors who became tired of businesses that took a stance on environmental, social and governance initiatives, otherwise known as ESG. GloriFi received financial backing from big-name investors including Ken Griffin, Peter Thiel, Jeff Sprecher who is the founder, CEO and chairman of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange; Rick Jackson, CEO of Georgia-based Jackson Healthcare LLC; Nick Ayers, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence; and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate.
* The suit accuses those investors of executing a plan to take down the company using so-called ""Trojan horse"" investments in the form of convertible debt, obtaining the right to block subsequent capital raises, attempts to put ""their people"" in executive positions at GloriFi while ""attempting to sow dissension"" within the existing ranks and insincere promises to keep funding the company while launching a campaign to block competing sources of capital
* The suit mentions how Ramasawamy launched a competitor, Strive Asset Management, in 2022. Strive had backing from Thiel, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, now the Republican vice presidential candidate.
* My current event here is mostly just to watch popular conservative-leaning businesses to see if there’s any connection. The companies of conservative Founders have been enjoying quite the bull market recently including Palantir and Oracle.

TWO WEEKS NOW.

I’ve never posted to Reddit before but I figured this issue warrants a post. I’m living in an apartment with my sister and am in college. I’ve brought up the issue to her NUMEROUS times of her lack of cleanliness when it comes to the kitchen. I have to beg her to do dishes, despite us having a now working dishwasher. It was broken before hence the reluctance from her to wash the dishes. Now that the washer is up and working she still barely does the dishes and it’s getting to the point that some weeks it just stinks (from old coffee and cooking). This week is throwing me for a loop and I’ve been more than fed up. Since she’s my sister the more economical choice is to live with her for now until I graduate.

Most of the time I end up washing half the sink of dishes because we only have a set amount, and of course I have to use them to cook. I’ve tried being understanding of it with her studies taking a chunk of her time. She gives me these kinda bs excuses for why she can’t do them (I’m busy at the moment with hw or I’ll do them tomorrow) which often times lasts for two weeks or a week before she finally does them. It doesn’t help that she doesn’t contribute to other chores like cleaning up after herself in the living room or taking out the trash. She doesn’t even cook much, so I’m relegated to doing pretty much all the housework. The only time she pitches in besides when she “feels” like it is when a friend comes over and she shows that she can be capable of cleaning. Idk what to do since my parents said I’d have to stick with her, and single bed apartments/studios are expensive where I live. Please help. Thanks.",7,1728405210.0,badroommates,7,0.9,False
1fz43fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1fz43fj/was_i_in_a_toxic_environment_software_engineers/,Was i in a toxic environment? (software engineers are welcome),"Hi everybody.

I apologize if this is not the proper topic for this question. I also apologize filling some points with technical details: you can ignore them if you're not in the field, but i tried to write them to let also non-technical figures understand the point.

I'm an italian software engineer, 26 y/o. I've graduated in April 2022 and i started to work the same month for a company that i left the same year, where i used to be a computer vision engineer. I wasn't officially fired because i was working there as freelancer, but, looking at the harsh reality... I was fired. Now i'm extremely happy and well-paid in the company i've joined immediately after in Germany, but i keep thinking over and over again about what happened in my former experience. By writing down all the things that i did properly and i did not, and making comparisons with my current company, i'm suspecting that was a toxic environment, but i always want further opinions from people with more experience than me before coming to a conclusion.

I will provide you with a bullet-point list of things that happened in my former company. I would like you to tell me whether, in your opinion, it was a toxic environment or not:

- They gave me a five-hour interview to hire me, and the company was extremely small (only 9 people). The process was made of a behavioral speech, a code challenge and a mathematical interview. The salary wasn't high: about 1,700 euros per month, as a freelancer. Towards the end of the interview, I mentioned that I had already resigned from my previous job (i used to work during university as frontend developer). The interviewer (the CEO of the company) interrupted me and asked if I was an impulsive person, to which I explained that I already had a ready offer for a research contract. I should note that during the interview, I emphasized that I wanted to join that company because I didn't feel up to par and felt the urgency to learn new things in the AI and computer vision field. They hired me as a junior profile.

- Regarding the research contract, I had an agreement with a university professor to do a year of research in the field of databases. At my university, the field of computer vision is very strong, so much so that my former company is mostly made up of PhDs who came from that context. Upon hearing the professor's name, one of the members said, ""Ah, but that professor sucks""

- The company had a method of tracking activities: we had to log everything we did with a minimum granularity of fifteen minutes, including the project, subproject, and description. Every day, at all hours, we were required to populate it.

- I wrote a software to test different anomaly detection models and compare them. I did this always in close contact with the CEO of the company, who is also a very technical figure. After completing all the software and showing the results, there was one detail out of place: the seed to set to make random outputs deterministic was hardcoded and not parameterized—a lapse on my part. The CEO ignored all the rest of the work and began asking me why I had forgotten it and why I hadn't listened to him, emphasizing that, in his opinion, there was a strong need in the company not to repeat things and not to revisit what has already been done.

- When I was working on the agricultural image segmentation model, at one point I needed to apply a Gaussian blur to create the mask for learning the positioning of the points. In a nutshell: to make the loss function smoother, you fix the point at the position given by the tagger, then apply a Gaussian blur and normalize. This way, the loss can act on the entire neighborhood of the point. The problem was that the images didn't all have the same aspect ratio, so once resized to the same size, the size of the ""point clouds"" changed; it wasn't the same for all of them. This problem was later solved, and although I had noticed it, I admit that I decided to ignore it because I didn't think it was very impactful. When my senior noticed it, he pointed it out to me with great annoyance; when I reported it in the weekly meeting as a ""tricky"" issue, he told me privately, ""It wasn't a tricky issue; it was a bug you didn't notice.""

- All organized events always included moments where there were hidden tests: board games, card games, various activities. However, this was never declared and was always presented as simple pastime among friends. The same happened within the company: there were often hidden tests.

- Once, I heard a senior with whom I had worked only briefly say to another colleague ""Come here; I'll show you the crappy code you wrote."" With this same senior, the only time I worked with him, we had to integrate C code via Dart FFI for a Flutter application. After telling me to return to my projects, he later updated me saying, ""You would never have gotten there.""

- Once, I was unwell. Since I wasn't an employee, I didn't know how to proceed or how to populate the timesheet. The CEO kindly told me, ""If you're not well, don't work""

- My senior avoided discussing another mistake I had made during a coffee break because the CEO was listening; he didn't want to put me in a bad light.

- After making some mistakes, my senior and the CEO called me in. They told me they didn't like how I was working, that my assignment would expire in two months, and that they weren't sure about confirming me. This caused me significant emotional stress and anxiety, which then led me to make increasingly trivial mistakes in the subsequent period. Specifically, the CEO told me these exact words: ""Here we work in an environment where it's necessary for many things to line up, and if when you work, two plus two sometimes makes four and sometimes three and a half, that's not okay.""

- Shortly before my period ended, I had a concluding discussion with my senior. He analyzed my timesheet and told me that we had spent too much time doing one thing rather than another, mentioning that we had revisited the same issues too many times. He concluded by saying that he expected more initiative from me, and when I asked whether I was up to the company's standards, he gave me a disapproving look and changed the subject.

- I also had a final meeting with the CEO, in which he informed me that they didn't want to continue with me. First, he told me that he didn't see me fitting well in the company because I work well on well-defined and well-delineated tasks, while they have a more research/exploratory approach. After a few minutes, he said that expectations had not been met.

I want to specify, before concluding, that all the projects i've been working on with my senior have been completed and now are successful products. Thank you in advance for your time.",1,1728405146.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

A slightly different take on the ""Best restaurant in Tacoma?"" question we always get!","I feel like I am always Googling ""Best pho/teriyaki/pizza/burger/tacos in Tacoma reddit"" and while there are always amazing recommendations - some of these place's menus are insane. And we all know that not all of the best restaurants have the best dishes. Here are some of my favorite restuarants in Tacoma AND my favorite appetizers, entrees, dishes, desserts, orders, etc. 

**What are your favorites?**

**Mexican**

*  Taqueria El Sabor - bad place to start because actually everything is amazing. Love the breakfast burritos and tacos for my go-to
*  El Toro on Pearl - Carne Asada plate is what I get when I want something extremely satisfying
* La Rancherita food truck on Pearl - Chicken tacos. They are mid, but they aren't greasy and have great macros
* Taco Street in Point Ruston -  The burrito bowl is serviceable, healthy, and still satisfying
* Matador - Happy hour carne asada nachos. That's it. Get it!

**Pho & Vietnamese**

* Pho King - Brisket pho, pork bahn mi, chicken on stick!
* Pho Bac - Brisket pho
* VK Viet Kitchen - I have only been once. Looking for more amazing dishes!!! I had the soft stir fried egg noodle with chicken and IT WAS SO GOOD. We also got the chicken skewers and a taro bubble tea which were both crack
* La Ca Bar - Beef or Pork vermicelli bowl!!!

**Thai**

* Thai Pepper - My favorite pad thai in tacoma!
* Indo Asian - I guess this place is more fusion but love pork spring rolls, and khao soi!

**Pizza**

* Salamone's - good slice. I heard the owner is problematic but I also hear they are getting new owners?
* Bar Rosa - Margherita pizza and any cocktail. I DREAM ABOUT THEIR TIRAMISU

**Breakfast**

* Side Piece Kitchen - I just get a plain biscuit with honey butter. I love it.
* Howdy Bagel - Sausage bagel sandwich and everything else on the menu!
* The Pine Cone in UP - My favorite pancakes ever. I also enjoy most of their breakfast. nothing revolutionary but good diner food and coffee.

Okay I am realizing my list is so damn long so I will come back and edit this and add teriyaki, more thai, sandwiches, stuff like that!!! 

As you can see, I live in the north end and don't make it out of there enough. Tell me your favorite east and south tacoma spots I need to make it to!

He was in arranged marriage journey and I was too, we became friends on reddit and later shared social media and numbers. Became even closer. I had feelings for him, never had courage to tell it and it was hurting me. I decided create distance between me and him but few weeks back he phoned me that he is coming to my city (we both live in US) on work, it was unexpected trip and we planned to meet. 

We had sex multiple times in that week, he would make me coffee in the morning before leaving my place, lots of cuddling and intimate things we did. So on last day I told him feelings and I was expecting he will reciprocate but he didn't. He was only liking me as a friend. Then I asked him why we had sex and he screamed at me that just because we had sex I'm not his girlfriend and we are not in relationship. He even said I didn't ask you to have feelings for me, how can he say that? Before we met we also used to flirt, exchange nudes and did phone sex for many months. He is refusing to talk to me and thinks I'm acting annoying also not responded to my messages for last 1 day. I can see blue tick on whatsapp but no response, he's giving me silent treatment. He was the most caring person before this, I'm struggling to believe this is happening, he is acting like completely different person. We are both marathi and I was thinking we had some potential to get married. I saw a future with him.

Now I feel like some call girl or prostitute, I cannot understand why he had sex with me if I was just a friend. He has so many of my nudes and I'm going paranoid thinking what he might do with them. My trust in men is gone!     ",25,1728404909.0,Arrangedmarriage,48,0.77,False

1fz3y9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1fz3y9h/aitj_for_leaving_someone_on_read_who_contacted_me/,AITJ for leaving someone on read who contacted me 5 years after no contact? ,"Okay, context: 

Many moons ago I met someone and we instantly clicked as friends. Time went by and we ended up in a relationship.

The relationship went south (ex wanted to see other people but still keep me around just in case. I was in love so did that for a while until I realized I deserved better, lesson learned). 

When I made the decision to go no contact it was very difficult. Ex didn't fully agree with going no contact, but if I didn't, I would have been continuously used. 

When I went NC, the response was not good. 

I got stalked pretty hard and it went on for about a year. It really sucked too because I was just trying to start anew, and everytime the ex would somehow make contact with me (showing up to my work, calling me from random numbers) I'd already been missing them a bunch so I'd cave, catch-up, start to feel used again, and repeat the process. 

Again, years ago, and we were much younger. 

I know the evidence points to no contact being the best and healthiest option, and I know, at the time, it was. However, it felt and still feels like it (going no contact) was a pretty harsh thing to do.  

I essentially just shut this person, who had loved and cared for me (until the end of the friendship/ relationship) out my life. There were days when I felt real grief over that- it was super hard for a while. 

Anyways, to the point- I ultimately ""let go"" of the situation about 4 years ago. It was an out of sight, out of mind, kind of thing. Id been through quite a bit, relocated, matured, etc. 

I didnt really ""forget"" everything, but its just something that doesnt really exist anymore- the whole situation and the ex is very irelevant to my current life. 

However, recently, the Ex found me on a social media platform which I wasn't on when I first started blocking. 

So, yes, getting contacted about 5 years later was a shock. They happened to live somewhat nearby (crazy, cause I moved 2k miles away), and asked if I wanted to catch up for coffee.

While I've no interest in meeting up, it brought back a very familiar pain, which is the pain that comes from intentionally ignoring someone who, at one point, was my best friend. 

Am i being a jerk by not responding? 

I just find it kind of weird to purposely leave someone on read, rather than be like: 

Hey, I appreciate the invite (although i kind of dont, but i wouldnt mention that) but this is not something I'm comfortable with. Hope you're good though and best wishes! 

I think I primarily want to respond in that way because it feels like I'm not dehumanizing them, which they'd expressed in the past that that is how no contact made them feel. 

Anyway, yeah, am I being a jerk? What's the right thing to do here. ",18,1728404790.0,AmITheJerk,30,0.96,False

1fz3wd9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fz3wd9,Did I just found the cure for Chalazion and Blepharitis?,"First I wanna talk about that I have been struggling with mild Blepharitis on my left upper eyelid that gave me countless hordeolum on the same upper left eyelid which drained themself a couple of months after for almost 4 years or so now but it was a real struggle having them on my eye waiting for them to heal and just for them to come back again… 

Now I have been dealing with a hardened chalazion on my lower right eyelid that’s been there for almost 5 months now and it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere even with proper hygiene and 2x a day 10mins warm compressed with gently massage afterwards…

I have already seen 2 opthalmologist and 1 optometrist for my condition in 4 years, all of them just kept on telling me the same thing proper hygiene, warm compressed and gentle massage. They usually prescribed me the eyedrops and ointment when I have a inflamed hordeolum which helped somehow but didn’t actually tackle the root cause of it because they usually come back. I can’t really use those eye meds for a long period of time because you’re more likely to have the side effects if you do.

Now after seeing 3 different eye Doctors I’ve realized that they can’t really help me because what i’m looking for is a cure or a more permanent solution without relying on medication too much.

Our technology had advanced so much already that sometimes we didn’t know that one certain gadget could be a solution for other health problems. I have been using this Thermal Eye Massager with vibrations and microcurrent together with it’s own conductive gel for 10mins on chalazion area after doing the warm compressed using heated eye mask for 10mins also same routine for my left upper eyelid also with clean hands and face. Less coffee drinking because I’ve heard that could be one of the trigger also. After a week the I can see a big improvements on my Chalazion that once used to be hard and noticeable to now smaller close to unnoticeable and softer and hopefully will continue reducing it’s size until it’s gone and for my Blepharitis first I can see some drainage on my lash line similar to white heads and now it is less inflamed, no more crusting and itching even without using anti biotic ointment at all. I wish I have pictures of my before and after but I never do because I never thought of posting about my eye health problem after realizing that there’s a lot of us struggling with the same condition.  

This post is long enough so if any of y’all have questions just leave a comment and I’ll attach a video of a Doctor talking about the benefits of microcurrent for Dry Eyes to give you some information and as always proceed with caution.

We were both divorcees. We met twice, once for coffee and another time for lunch. Both times I was certain she was the one. However, she wanted to wait a year before I spoke with her father, she wanted to continue speaking with me to get to know me better during this time. I was a bit confused because I knew based on our conversations, we were both ready for marriage and found each other to be the right fit for each other, so I was hesitant to wait a year, but agreed because I was sort of smitten. 

Fast forward to 2 months later, I bump into her at a mosque that I don’t normally attend because it’s in a different city, but I was there for an event. When I saw her, I went up to her to say salaam but she completely ignores me, which I smacked my head because then I kinda understood, you know because we hadn’t made anything official yet. I was there for the same event she was there for, and that’s when it all went down hill. See, her husband was the speaker. Lol. And she was up there with him when he was introduced and he made a small introduction and mentioned his lovely wife…um his lovely wife, the same woman I’ve had coffee and lunch with and have been speaking with for the last 2 months. Can I just say, that even after experiencing divorce, I had never felt so shattered. My heart sunk with the feeling of betrayal and confusion. It was awful, I was so angry and disappointed. 

I contemplated going up to her husband and telling him everything after the event was over, but in the end I didn’t. I didn’t want to be the cause of fitna. She later sent me a very long text apologizing and swearing up and down that she is not in love with him, and that her husband is only kind to her when facing the public and behind closed doors he’s abusive, etc and that she plans to divorce him. Just so much mumbo jumbo, it was all noise to me. I didn’t want to waste my time anymore so I told her to never speak to me again, and that what she is doing is the act of the devil, I blocked her and moved on. 

Trust is literally everything to me, it’s a building block for a successful relationship. Without trust, you can never have a marriage. I had never ever in all of my imagination combined could ever imagine such a thing happening to me, or to anyone. Is this more normal nowadays?! It was so messed up. And it really made me lose interest in pursuing marriage for now, I’m just so tired 😔.

Question though, genuine replies only, should I keep this between myself and Allah or talk to someone about it like a sheikh or should I tell her husband? We were not physical, ever, but our conversations were intimate at times not to be confused with sexual. I want your honest opinion, please",6,1728404522.0,MuslimMarriage,5,0.88,False

1fz3t4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fz3t4x/my_karen_neighbor_is_harassing_me_even_after_i/,My Karen neighbor is harassing me even after I moved out,"I bought a house in 2019 in a rural area with about 5-6 neighbors within walking distance. In fall 2022 i had a new neighbor move in directly across the street from me. It's a farm house with a bunch of land and some animals including 6 dogs. I lived in my house for 5 years until I moved out this past summer. Before I moved, Karen made it her life goal to make my life hell because I wasn't doing what she wanted.

In summer 2023 she started calling into the county and complaining that my dog was barking. The sheriff  came out and talked to me about it. I didnt know he was bothering anyone since this was the first i had heard of it. He is a very hyper dog being a blue heeler and australian Sheppard mix. I already had been taking him to a training class and after this complaint i got a bark collar to help so i wouldnt get in trouble. I was trying to not upset any of my neighbors at this point. Ive never been in trouble with the law and i didnt want to start because of my dog. After all my efforts of bringing him in when he would start barking and having him in my 8pm every night, she still continued to call over and over and over until the sheriff said you either need to press charges or stop calling. So she pressed charges. Which lead to me getting a 100 dollar citation. So I fought it since I thought it wasn't fair of her to do that instead of just coming to talk to me about it. I went around to all the other neighbors and got 5 signatures from them saying they are not bothered by my dog. Not one other neighbor said they had any issues with hearing my dog. We went to court where she lied about times of day and how long my dogs were outside. And submitted a 5 minute video of him barking (not the whole time but it showed him barking). She also said i antaganize my dogs to make them bark by playing ball with them in the back yard.... which i then responded.. I am not going to stop playing with my dogs.. and the magistrate said that is not a problem. So it was a ""are you responsible"" type of case and I've never been to court so I was shaking and so scared to be there so i felt like i didnt defend myself very well, but I wanted to show her you can't just bully people and get away with it. She also tried to do the same thing to the neighbor that is next to her. I read the text exchange between them in court which said things like ""I have friends in law enforcement"" and ""my contractor packed up and left because your dog was barking"". reading this in court made the magistrate tell her you can't be going around doing this, and what contractor would leave over a dog barking... but either way I was found responsible, but I was happy that she had to go to court so hopefully they see that in the future next time she tries to mess with someone. After court, I heard my dogs start barking like crazy one day after I had just checked on them and they were laying down. I go look out the front window and Karen is outside with her dogs recording my dogs..... so she was antagonizing them so she could record them barking. Then I take my trash out to the road and she was in her yard and says ""nice f***king barking collar you got there!"" And we started yelling at each other until I went back inside. She has been an absolute nightmare. 

But I moved out a few months ago and was working on updating my house to sell it, and my dogs have not been there since the beginning of summer and neither have I. I am now trying to sell it and she is now calling my realtor and complaining about how many people are going in and out and kids are playing in the front yard when she is trying to enjoy her coffee. 

What can I do about this crazy entitled neighbor?! Can I call the county and say she is still harassing me? Do I have to put up with it until I sell my house? I just can't take her still trying to mess with me when she was wrong in the first place for not just coming to talk to me like a normal human being.

1fz3nzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1fz3nzb/time_looped_chapter_18/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 18,"Will watched as his friend shattered before his very eyes. Helen had done a good job arriving at the scene in record time, though too good of a job as far as Alex was concerned. The expression of determined vengefulness on her face made the boy glad they were on the same side.

*Knights really do fight well,* he thought.

“Are you okay?” the girl asked.

Given what just had occurred one would think that a small crowd would have started to gather. At least someone should have noticed a girl leaping over a school fence and shattering a boy to fragments of glass. And yet, no one did. People continued to honk, rushing off to some place or other. A local shop worker gave the car lot a general glance, then returned to getting things ready for the day.

“Yeah.” Will tried to move off the spot he was standing. The mirror tile kept on holding him tight.

As he was hesitating whether to try and smash it or not, Helen approached and did just that. On cue, he no longer felt stuck.

“Thanks.” He stepped away. “You got here fast.”

“I’m good at gymnastics,” the girl said, looking at where Alex had been. By now, the glass fragments had all but evaporated as if they had never been.

“Seen anything like this before?”

The girl shook her head. “Are you sure it was Alex?” she asked. “I mean, this wasn’t him, but are you sure he’s the one?”

“Yep.” Will walked up to the mirror pole and tapped it with his hand.

 

**The class has already been found by someone else. Next time, try sooner.**

 

The familiar message appeared on it.

“See?”

“He must have learned some trick.” The boy looked at the ground again. “Or more than a few tricks.”

During his brief speech, the goofball had given Will the impression he had been at this far longer than either of them, possibly even longer than Danny. Catching him was going to be difficult, although Will had gained one huge advantage: he’d found the location of the starting mirror. Still, there was something that didn’t add up.

“Want some mousse?” he turned to the girl.

“What?”

“Chocolate mousse. I know a place.”

Helen tilted her head, arms crossed.

“We’ve got six minutes till the next loop. After what just happened I don't feel like going to class. Why not use the time to chill a bit in a coffee shop?”

The chances of such an offer being accepted were a hundred to one. If this were a date, or there was a chance that it seemed like a date, he’d never be so straightforward. Since it was loop related, and there were only a few minutes left, Will wasn’t going to feel particularly bad if he were shot down.

On her part, Helen, would normally never accept such an invitation. Everything else aside, she liked to know where she’d be going and gathered a few second-hand opinions of the place first. Going to a random coffee shop that served “chocolate mousse” was without question not it. And yet only a minute later both of them were sitting inside, taking advantage of the place’s cocoa.

“Are you sure you’re supposed to be here?” the barista asked with a note of suspicion. “Isn’t it a school day or—”

“First period teacher got stuck in traffic,” Helen interrupted without batting an eye. “We thought we’d go somewhere special.”

“Ah.” The barista nodded, as if the answer made anything clear. “Right. I’ll go check the inventory.” He gave them a sly nod, then discretely wandered off.

“How fast can you get to the parking lot?” Will asked, the moment they were let alone, doing his best to ignore what she had insinuated just then.

“Running, jumping out of windows… ten-fifteen seconds. It’s not that far if you follow a straight line.” She took a sip of her drink. “Straightish.”

“Even after getting the knight?”

“It takes me less than a second to get the knight. I’m already in the bathroom, remember? Wasn’t like that when Daniel was alive. Then, it sometimes took me half a minute.”

“You never said that.”

“Well, excuse me for not discussing things relating to a dead close friend. He wasn’t supposed to die, either.”

Will had an inkling of how she felt, but even so had hoped she’d share such important things. So, a looped’s death caused eternity to change. It sort of sounded logical.

“When you became a rogue, you pulled the loop forward. At least for me. Of course, I did the same thing I did every morning.”

“Get to the mirror and get your class,” the boy said along with her. “That means Alex will be in front of his mirror too.”

There went the idea of catching the goofball by surprise. Still, it was possible to make things uncomfortable for him. It would take Helen fifteen seconds to get there. With a bit of running, Will could reach the spot as well from the other side. Some testing would be required to tell whether it would be faster to get his rogue class first or run directly to the mirror. Either way, it would put pressure on Alex.

“So, that’s your big plan?” The girl didn’t look at all impressed.

“Of course not,” the boy lied. “We know where he starts. We know where he has to be to get Danny’s file—”

“Not that it will do us any good,” Helen uttered beneath her breath.

“We know that…” the boy paused. “A class has three skills, right?”

“Pretty much.”

“I’m serious. Are there any with more?”

“Not that I know of. Daniel said that all the classes were front heavy and started with three at most.”

“Then it’s impossible.”

The girl narrowed her eyes.

“I mean Alex,” the boy continued. “I know one of his skills is to make him faster. I saw that when I chased after the archer. I also know that he can create traps, and we saw that he can make copies of himself.”

“That makes three.”

“How come no one sees him?” Will leaned back triumphantly. “Even if he has a mirror copy of him rushing off to get Danny’s files, how does he get both copies without being seen or raising the alarm? You tried breaking into June’s office. How did that go?”

“Invisibility…” the girl said.

“And lock picking.”

“Please. That’s child’s play. Anyone can pick a lock with a basic set of tools. Daniel taught me how.”

“I still doubt it, but okay. That still makes four skills, which—” the boy raised a finger “—he must have *before* getting to the nurse’s mirror. Otherwise, she’d have seen him as well.” He grabbed his phone from his pocket and started typing a text. “Danny said that there were only four classes at the school, right?”

“Yeah, but he didn’t say anything about outside. There could be more. The parking lot isn’t part of the school either.”

That was true. It was possible that he’d taken a class from elsewhere. If so, that might complicate Will’s plan a bit.

Helen leaned closer to see what he was typing, but the angle remained uncomfortable.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“I’m texting to Alex. If all goes well, we might not have to fight after all.” The message sent, he put the phone on the table. “We’ll still have to be ready, though. Just in case.”

The girl took the phone. The text read: *Talk after 1 period* , followed by a mirror and hand emoji.

“Mirror and hand?” The girl looked at him.

“Or we’ll break your mirror.”

It wasn’t a very realistic threat, especially considering the nature of the mirror in question. Still, it was a clear threat that they were going to make life difficult for Alex in every loop moving on. The only question was, whether he’d believe them.

With less than a minute left to the end of the loop, the barista returned to check if they wanted anything else. Despite his reluctance, Will ordered a chocolate mousse, telling Helen she had to try it. Before she had the chance, however…

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Another loop, another rush through the bathroom. Will didn’t pause to wait for Alex or the daily insult coming from the pair of girls. Getting the rogue right off, he went to the art classroom. Helen was already there, as usual, opening the windows. Silently, the boy assisted, then sat at Daniel’s desk.

One by one, the rest of the class started to arrive. Everyone did the exact same things they had been doing for hundreds of loops. The same jokes, coughs, and nasty comments. Students went to the same places asking the same questions to receive the same answers. In his mind, Will often finished the conversations for them, seconds before they had a chance to do it. Then, something different happened. When the jocks came in, they no longer did so with their usual yell. In fact, they were rather quiet, discussing football strategies. Jace didn’t even pay attention to Will, joining the rest of the group at their desks.

*Huh?* Will thought.

After experiencing the same things so many times, he almost wanted to go to them and start a fight himself. It wasn’t even about extending the loop—he knew precisely what actions he had to do in order to achieve that—but rather out of a sense of tradition.

As for the goofball, there was no notable difference. Ever since he had been discovered, Alex had stopped coming to class, doing his thing elsewhere.

Eight o’clock. The bell rang marking the start of class.

The teacher, barely arrived, told the class to prepare their drawing materials—as he did each loop—then went to close the nearest window. Unexpectedly, the door opened once more. Everyone turned in its direction only to see their very own goofy classmate standing there, carrying a large paper bag of something.

“Should I even ask?” The teacher sighed as his glance fell on the bag Alex was carrying.

“It’s fire, teach!” The boy reached in and took out a muffin. “Muffins, the progressive nature morte!”

The entire class erupted in laughter. Even the teacher found it difficult to remain indifferent. Despite all his other faults, and Will could think of several since the recent revelation, the goofball remained highly amusing.

“While I’m impressed you know the phrase, muffins can hardly be described as a nature morte,” the teacher said once calm was restored.

“But, they’re lit. And I brought enough for everyone.”

“Great. I’m sure your classmates would appreciate that… after class. Until then please put the bag on my desk where it won’t serve as a drawing inspiration.”

Alex shrugged, returned the muffin to the rest, folded the top of the paper bag, then placed it on the teacher’s desk. A few rogue comments followed from other members of class, all attempting to match his humor and failing at it. That didn’t disturb the boy in the least. In his usual swagger, he went straight to Will’s old desk and sat down.

“Brought your muffin, bro,” he whispered as he took out his drawing materials from his backpack. It was subtle, but enough to let him know that the truce had been accepted.

Class continued as usual. Will and Helen finished their assignments first, earning themselves a lot of praise and envy. To everyone’s surprise, so did Alex. Seeing the goofball’s “hidden talent” almost made the teacher get a stroke. It was more than skill, it was mastery that required years of practice to perfect.

While the rest of the class was astonished at the result, Will felt a lump in his throat. Alex was sending him a warning. Being looped for so much longer had also made him a lot more experienced. In both confrontations so far, he had proved to have the upper hand. Although, interestingly enough, not once had he attacked. He could done so have back when Will had no idea what was going on. Helen had, after all, so why hadn’t Alex?

The bell sounded bringing the class to an end.

“And remember,” the teacher said just as everyone started putting away their belongings.

“Practice makes perfect,” the students continued in the most unenthusiastic fashion possible.

“Or something of the sort,” the man said with a smile showing he was accustomed to disappointment. “Alex, Will, I’d like to have a word with you sometime this week.”

“Sure, bro!” The goofball grinned.

“Ok,” Will replied in a quiet tone. If this were outside the loop, he would have been thrilled. Right now, the only thing on his mind was the conversation.

“Great. Oh, and don’t forget your…” The teacher pointed at the paper bag on his desk.

“Nah, keep it, teach. For next time.”

A few bouts of laughter erupted as the people poured out into the corridor.

“Nice sketch,” Helen tore away from her friends. “Must have taken you a while to get the technique right.”

“Nah, bro. I’m lit.” He smiled.

Two of Helen’s friends rolled their eyes, leaving the room with a “don’t take long” glance at her.

“Yard?” Will asked in a whisper.

“Muffin place.” Alex finished packing his backpack. “My treat.”

“Muffin place,” the girl repeated.

It sounded just like something the goofball would suggest. It was also a good move. Open spaces gave him the advantage. Additionally, given that it was his home turf, there was every chance that he had set up a trap or two.

“Fine. Let’s go.” Will tossed the backpack on his shoulder.

“For real, bro?” The goofball arched his eyebrows, surprised.

“If it’s a trap, we can still do what I said in the next loop.” Will paused. “And all the loops after.”",3,1728404063.0,redditserials,2,0.81,False
