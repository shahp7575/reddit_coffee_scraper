1mmjh7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1mmjh7s/starvation_caravan_how_poverty_is_driving/,Starvation Caravan: How Poverty is Driving Honduras and El Salvador to the Brink,"In a landscape seared by sun and sea, the familiar rhythms of planting and harvest have been replaced by anxious calculations. How many days can a child go without corn tortillas before desperation tips a family into migration or depends on food aid. In 2025 nearly 20 percent of young children in Honduras suffer developmental delays from chronic malnutrition a figure delivered cold and sharp by the World Food Programme. Honduras shoulders crushing poverty with 63 percent of its people living in poverty and one in five rural residents bearing extreme poverty. The economic toll of malnutrition and obesity burdens the nation by some $618 million annually roughly 2.7 percent of GDP according to WFP data. In El Salvador more than 800, 000 people or about 15 percent of those assessed face crisis or worse acute food insecurity in the March to June 2024 period via IPC classification.

Honduras clings to hope in the Dry Corridor yet trembles. This stretch across Central America is home to millions half living by subsistence farming. In 2024 alone some 486,000 were hit by severe drought, and over 2.7 million will need food assistance this year as El Niño intensifies climate chaos according to WFP briefings. Nearly 90 percent of communities across the region now see climate change as an existential threat, over 80 percent pointing straight at climate shocks as the spike in food insecurity.

Families are forced into impossible choices. Fields lie barren, yields blighted by heat, drought, floods. In El Salvador coffee farms that fed generations continue collapsing under climate stress deforestation and disappearing global demand with coffee exports down 65 percent over two decades per a Guardian report. In Honduras the Dry Corridor has turned hard soil into migration routes. The thirsty earth forces people onto roads that lead north.

Food aid keeps the most desperate alive but is at best a bandage, not a cure. Many try migrating north to survive their households. UNHCR reports over 318,000 people internally displaced across Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala, many driven by hunger, deepening poverty, and relentless climate breakdown.

Solutions are emergent from both desperation and innovation. The Disaster Risk Insurance and Finance in Central America Consortium brought together World Bank and WFP to build agricultural insurance programs for two million smallholder farmers across the Northern Triangle boosting resilience to climate shocks. The specter of crop ruin may yet be softened by financial safety nets. Local communities are sowing seeds of resistance through drought-resistant crops agroforestry and rebuilding local food economies.

International and regional aid bodies call for more. Humanitarian and development interventions must invest in anticipatory drought response social protection systems sustainable farming and debt relief. The UN’s anticipatory action framework for drought across Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador is designed to trigger pre-emptive action before famine stalks fields.

This is not abstract policy this is tangible survival. Families balancing between food aid and migration are not collateral damage. They are the reporters of a crisis born not of happenstance but of failed systems layered with climate breakdown and grinding poverty. These are the people telling a story about what happens when land and promises dry up.

## Key Features Analysis

The epoxy resin coffee table market is diverse,with options ranging from simple designs to intricate works of art. Understanding the key features that differentiate these tables will empower you to choose one that perfectly aligns with your aesthetic preferences and functional requirements.

**Wood Type and Quality:** The base wood used significantly impacts the table's appearance and durability.

The type of wood used considerably affects the overall aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. Common choices like walnut, oak, maple, and cherry offer varying grain patterns, colors, and hardness levels. Walnut is prized for its rich, dark tones and sophisticated grain, while oak is known for its durability and classic appearance. Maple offers a lighter, more contemporary feel, while cherry ages beautifully to a warm reddish-brown hue. The quality of the wood is also a crucial factor; look for kiln-dried wood to minimize warping or cracking over time. The presence of knots, figured grain, or live edges further influence the unique character of the table.

**Epoxy Resin Composition and Clarity:** The quality of the epoxy and its application affect the table's visual appeal and longevity.

The type and quality of epoxy resin used are critical to the table's final look and durability. High-quality epoxy resins are UV-resistant, preventing yellowing over time, and they offer extraordinary clarity, allowing the natural beauty of the wood to shine through. The resin's hardness also impacts its resistance to scratches and other wear and tear. Proper mixing and application are essential to prevent bubbles, imperfections, or cloudiness that can detract from the table's visual appeal. The color, pigments, or other additives mixed with the resin determine the unique design elements of the table, like a river effect, ocean scene, or abstract patterns.**Table Dimensions and Shape:** The size and shape should complement your living space and needs.

The table's dimensions should be carefully considered to ensure it complements the size and layout of your living room. A large, sprawling table might overwhelm a smaller space, while a smaller table could get lost in a larger room. The height of the table is also crucial, typically falling between 16 and 20 inches to comfortably accommodate the height of most sofas and chairs. The shape of the table can also impact its functionality and aesthetic; rectangular tables are versatile and offer ample surface area, while round or oval tables can create a more intimate and conversational setting. Consider the placement of the table in relation to other furniture and walkways to ensure it doesn't obstruct movement.

**Base and Leg Design:** The style of the legs should match the overall aesthetic.The design of the table legs or base significantly contributes to the overall style and stability of the coffee table. Options range from sleek metal legs in various finishes like black, chrome, or brass, to handcrafted wooden legs that complement the wood used in the tabletop. The leg design can range from minimalist styles that emphasize the tabletop's beauty to more elaborate designs that add a touch of elegance or rustic charm. Sturdy construction and secure attachment of the legs are vital to ensure the table's stability and prevent wobbling or tipping. Consider the floor surface and whether adjustable feet are needed to level the table on uneven floors. The style of the base heavily dictates the room's overall aesthetics.

Key features of epoxy resin coffee tables include:

*   unique and personalized designs
*   Durable and long-lasting construction

There’s been a lot of misinformation floating around lately about the city’s finances, both past and present. So let’s take a moment to walk through what’s really happening. Grab a cup of coffee, pull up a chair, and settle in.

What's going on?

The big issue right now is Senate Bill 1 (SB1), also known as Senate Enrolled Act 1. This law cuts property taxes for homeowners and businesses statewide. Sounds nice, right? The average homeowner will save about $257 a year by 2031 on a home assessed at $250,000.

That small savings comes with a big cost: about $6 million in lost revenue for the City of Elkhart.
Now, that alone would be painful but manageable.

But here’s the real problem.
Under the current system, a portion of the local income taxes you pay goes from the county to the city each year. In 2025, that amount is $34.8 million.
Starting in 2028, that money disappears.

So in total, the city will lose roughly $40 million a year beginning in 2028 — which is one-third of our entire budget. That isn't a one time loss in 2028, it's every year.

To put it in personal terms, this is like your household going from making $60,000 a year to $40,000,  but still needing to cover the same bills.

“Just cut spending!”

Sure. But here’s the problem.
Public safety (police, fire, and dispatch) makes up about $63.8 million of our $125 million budget, over half 

Even if we eliminated every single non-essential department — parks, cemeteries, the airport, the environmental center, the railroad museum, the Lerner Theater, Ideal Beach, and all related programs, all the things that make Elkhart Elkhart,  that would only save us about $11.2 million per year. No thank you.

That’s not even one-third of the $40 million hole we’re facing.

So what are our options?

We asked the folks at Baker Tilly to walk us through some possibilities. Here’s what they presented:

1. Local Income Tax (LIT)
If passed in 2027, it could bring in $14 million in 2028. The downside? If the county passes one too, city residents get taxed twice.

2. Food and Beverage Tax
Could generate around $1.9 million a year. But we need the state’s permission to implement it.

3. Trash Fee
Brings in about $1.2 million annually.

4. Wheel Tax
About $1.3 million per year, and it’s now a requirement to receive matching road funds from the state (up to $1 million in grants). But again, city residents would be double-taxed alongside the county wheel tax.

Put all of those together and we get around $18.5 million — less than half of the $40 million we’re losing.

Even if we passed every one of these and made deep cuts, we would still be nearly $10 million short.

Let’s bust a few myths.

1. “The city overspent and now it’s broke!”
Nope. The city has consistently passed balanced budgets and maintains a $12 million rainy day fund, exactly what the state recommends. 

2. “The city’s bond rating was cut!”
False. Our bond rating hasn’t changed in over a decade. It remains strong and stable.

3. “We failed the 2022 audit!”

Wrong again. The 2022 audit flagged a few bureaucratic errors related to ARPA fund procedures, which were corrected with a state-approved plan. There was no fraud, no theft, no clawback, no criminal investigation. Goshen, Mishawaka, Southbend and other communities had the same issues, and we’re all corrected. 

If a nothing burger was a sandwich, this would be a double Whopper with cheese.

4. “The toll road sign was a waste of money!”
The  money paid for the toll road project came from a special TIF fund — which means it was legally restricted to infrastructure inside the Cass TIF district. So Greeleaf and East Jackson didn’t pay for the toll road change, Wal-Mart and Planet Fitness did. 

5. “It’s the Democrats’ fault!”
Hard to blame one party when GOP council-led cities like Goshen are facing the same crisis and just advanced their own wheel tax. This is a state-level issue that affects every community in Indiana, regardless of party. This is an all hands on deck situation, not one divided by partisan politics. 

6. “We should have saved more money!”
Even if we hadn’t increased spending at all since 2023, we still wouldn’t be able to absorb a single year of these cuts. In fact our non utility debt is over 30% since 2020, and we have 81% more funds in our general fund as well. But it's nowhere near enough to cover a single year of the 40 million gap.

So, let’s keep the conversation focused on solutions, not conspiracy theories.

So… what now?

Everything is on the table, potential new revenue sources, potential cuts, and continued advocacy to reverse these state-level changes before they devastate every local government in Indiana.

No one wants to cut services. No one wants to raise taxes. But thanks to SB1, we may be forced to do some of both — or lose the ability to maintain basic services like police, fire, and roads. 

What can you do? Reach out to your state representatives and tell them to repeal the Local income tax changes. 

Let’s keep our property tax cuts, but not defund our public safety departments in the process.",1,1754834655.0,Indiana,0,1.0,False

I (17F) met this guy “Jake” a few months ago at the skate park near my friend’s house. He told me he was 19, which seemed believable — he dressed young, hung out with other guys around that age, and honestly looked like he was in uni or something.

We started talking more and more, and I thought we were just casually flirting at first. Then he started buying me coffee, offering to give me rides home, and just generally being super sweet. I was into it. I even told my friends, “He’s different. Mature, but still young enough to get it.”

About a month in, one of my friends looked at him and went, “You sure he’s 19? He gives… older vibes.” I laughed it off, but the thought stuck in my head.

Last week, we were hanging out at his place (nothing happened beyond talking and watching movies, so don’t freak out) and his wallet was on the table. I wasn’t snooping — he literally asked me to grab it for him. His driver’s licence fell out.

Birth year: 1999.

I froze. Did the math in my head, thought I was wrong, did it again. He’s 26. Seven years older than he said.

I confronted him right there, and he tried to play it off like it “wasn’t a big deal” and “I didn’t want you to think I was weird.” But like… you are weird for lying about something that huge. I told him straight up I’m 17, so he’s been aware of my age the entire time.
 
i told him i had to go to the bathroom but i ran off. he has been messaging me but i haven’t responded yet i don’t know what to say i like him but it’s just so weird- what should i do ",2,1754834645.0,teenagers,3,1.0,False

I have a 3 and a half month old and she is SO DIFFICULT. All she does is cry, cry, cry and cry. I love her with every single piece of me and I would do anything in this world for her but she is draining every single ounce of me. She cries constantly. And she has done ever since being a newborn. She has reflux & CMPA and is a very gassy baby, so my heart really does ache for her. But since being on medication she’s been much better and no longer cries because she’s in pain but instead she cries just because.. well I don’t know??? wants to cry??? I play with her, she cries, I change her nappy, she cries, she’s tired? She cries… anything and everything, she cries!!! And it’s a cry where absolutely nothing settles her down but food. Even if she’s been fed 5oz an hour ago, she will just continue to cry until a bottle is in her mouth. And then it becomes a battle of well shall I just feed her because I know she’s now crying for it or shall I just let her keep crying because surely she cannot be hungry and I do not want to over feed her. I tend to not feed her and try distract her. But is this the right thing to do??? I know she isn’t crying because she’s hungry, she’s crying because she’s been triggered from me either changing her nappy or because she’s got bored of playing etc… 

I just I cannot handle it. There’s been plenty of times where I’ve had to just place her down while I walk away and cry. It’s so overwhelming and it’s making me regret having a baby. And then having those thoughts make me feel worthless like I’m an awful mum. There’s women out there who would love to have a baby that sadly cannot and I’m here complaining about mine crying. I feel awful I really do. I don’t want to feel this way but I’m at my limit. All I do is cry. I cannot take her out on my own incase she has a melt down in public. I cannot go and have coffee dates with friends incase she gets herself into a crying episode. I don’t go out because I’m worried she’s going to scream and cry. I just need to know, does anyone else have a baby like this??? Surely this isn’t normal? I’m a first time mum so having a baby is a huge change anyway, but then to have a baby that cries 24/7 is even more of shock and huge adjustment. 

My friend has just had a baby too and she never cries unless for basic needs. she just feeds, sleeps and plays. And seeing how her baby is just makes me wish I could have that first time baby experience. But I haven’t, and I feel like it’s been totally stripped away from us both. It’s weird because I wouldn’t change her for the world, I love her exactly the way she is and I really would die for my baby. She is my everything. But wow I never expected this. I don’t know myself anymore, I’m just a shell of who I once was. 

This is a really long message. I don’t even think many of you will make it to the end. But if you have then thank you. So much. I don’t really know what I’m wanting to get from this. But even just writing this all out has made me feel much better. ",3,1754834569.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

Wrong again. The 2022 audit flagged a few bureaucratic errors related to ARPA fund procedures, which were corrected with a state-approved plan. There was no fraud, no theft, no clawback, no criminal investigation. Goshen, Mishawaka, Southbend and other communities had the same issues, and we’re all corrected. 

If a nothing burger was a sandwich, this would be a double Whopper with cheese.

4. “The toll road sign was a waste of money!”
The  money paid for the toll road project came from a special TIF fund — which means it was legally restricted to infrastructure inside the Cass TIF district. So Greeleaf and East Jackson didn’t pay for the toll road change, Wal-Mart and Planet Fitness did. 

5. “It’s the Democrats’ fault!”
Hard to blame one party when GOP council-led cities like Goshen are facing the same crisis and just advanced their own wheel tax. This is a state-level issue that affects every community in Indiana, regardless of party. This is an all hands on deck situation, not one divided by partisan politics. 

6. “We should have saved more money!”
Even if we hadn’t increased spending at all since 2023, we still wouldn’t be able to absorb a single year of these cuts. In fact, non utility debt in Elkhart is down 34% since 2020, and our general fund balance has increased 81% in that time as well.  But it's not enough.


Let’s keep the conversation focused on solutions, not conspiracy theories.

So… what now?

Everything is on the table, potential new revenue sources, potential cuts, and continued advocacy to reverse these state-level changes before they devastate every local government in Indiana.

No one wants to cut services. No one wants to raise taxes. But thanks to SB1, we may be forced to do some of both — or lose the ability to maintain basic services like police, fire, and roads. 

What can you do? Reach out to your state representatives and tell them to repeal the Local income tax changes. 

Let’s keep our property tax cuts, but not defund our public safety departments in the process.",1,1754834487.0,Elkhart,0,1.0,False

Fast forward and it’s now sitting at $7k MRR. No crazy ads, just organic traffic, word of mouth, and a handful of Reddit comments here and there. I still host it on a pretty cheap setup.

Honestly, I call it “AI slop” because under the hood, it’s not that pretty. But people don’t care—they care about the results.

1mmjb6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1mmjb6a/uncover_the_benefits_of_santo_remedio_joint/,Uncover the benefits of Santo Remedio Joint Health Support review for improved mobility!,"The product **Santo Remedio SR-N-168-60 Joint Health Support** caught my interest as someone who has been grappling with my own joint health challenges. Testing it over several weeks gave me plenty of time to uncover its strengths and areas where it could improve. Here's my personal dive into using this joint health supplement daily.  

**Packaging and First Impressions**  
Straight out of the box, the product packaging was compact and practical. It’s small enough not to clutter your cabinet, measuring 4.09 x 1.81 x 1.77 inches. However, the plain design almost made me miss some important details about the ingredients printed on it. I’d recommend the makers include more visually striking or clearer labeling for quick reference. For a product touted as joint support, its packaging gives more functional vibes than excitement.  

**Ease of Use and Form**  
Since the supplement comes in capsule form, it was super easy to integrate into my routine. Popping one with my morning coffee—a habit I already have—felt seamless. Each serving consists of two capsules, and I appreciated that there was no overpowering flavor—it’s unflavored, truly sparing my palate. However, swallowing them can be tricky if you’re not into large capsules; they’re slightly bigger than I’d prefer.  

**Positives**  
The ingredients in this joint health supplement are where it shines. The inclusion of Glucosamine, MSM, Chondroitin Sulfate, and Turmeric all hit the key areas for someone like me who deals with occasional stiffness. Turmeric especially has a long-standing reputation for its anti-inflammatory benefits. I noticed reduced morning stiffness within the first five days, which aligns with the product’s claim for quick results with continuous use.  

- Clinically proven ingredients such as Turmeric and MSM.  
- Relief noticeable in as little as 5 days of daily use.  
- Gluten-free, catering to adults with specific dietary restrictions.  
- Promotes bone and joint well-being.  

**Click here to uncover current Santo Remedio SR-N-168-60 deals on Amazon.**  

**Negatives**  
Despite the positives, I’d be remiss not to mention some limitations. While effective for mild joint discomfort and keeping flexibility intact, it didn’t fully address the deeper joint issues I sometimes encounter after strenuous activities like jogging. It seems better suited for light everyday support rather than comprehensive relief for severe discomfort or advanced conditions.  

- Capsules might be too large for some users to swallow easily.  
- Falls short in handling more intense or long-standing joint pain.  

**Alternatives**  
Comparing this supplement to other popular joint care products, I had a chance to pit it against one I’ve used in the past, which contains Collagen and Hyaluronic Acid alongside Turmeric. In fairness, the Santo Remedio supplement takes pride in its use of clinically tested TAMAFLX®, which feels more targeted toward quick relief. However, others might provide additional hydration benefits for long-term cartilage repairs. While this product excels in delivering faster results, its competitors offer better coverage for chronic conditions over time.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
This supplement doesn’t come cheap, and it’s competing with similar items that promise broader benefits. However, it’s cost-effective in its own right, given the quality of the ingredients and the noticeable, prompt results. It’s a reliable option for those who need something efficient, especially if they don’t want to play the waiting game with their supplements. While not the most budget-friendly choice off the shelf, it’s a solid trade-off for daily improvement in joint comfort without side effects.

Okay, so... have you heard about **AI gift cards**? I stumbled across this crazy concept, and I can’t decide if I’m absolutely thrilled – or slightly terrified – by what these things can *actually* do.

Picture this: instead of picking a Starbucks card for your friend because you used up all your creative brain juice, you have an **AI-powered gift card** that figures out exactly what your friend wants. Not just “coffee” or “chocolates,” but something that mines their interests, online activity, maybe even their Goodreads or Netflix likes. The system then curates and delivers the *perfect* present, apparently on your behalf. How is this not wild?

I just spent an hour doom-scrolling and then found another site in the rabbit hole (had to share, it’s lowkey addicting):  
https://goodnovel.org/  
If you’re as fascinated as me about how tech is shaking things up – that’s a must-click.

But honestly, I keep thinking of all the ways this could play out. It’s like, is it:

- Awesome, because no more last-minute “Happy Birthday, Amazon eCard” emergencies?
- A little creepy that your friend’s wish list is pieced together by an algorithm?
- Both, honestly?! I can see it saving so much stress. But are we really outsourcing our caring and thoughtfulness to robots now?

It also got me thinking about the *experience* of getting a gift. There's something pretty potent about knowing someone took time to choose something they thought you'd love, right? But then, what if the AI actually knows you *better*? Imagine receiving something ridiculously on-point, like the latest fantasy book rec because last week you spent hours on https://goodnovel.org/ (hint: it works, I checked). Now you’re wondering if your best friend’s “perfect” pick is their intuition – or just clever coding.

- AI gift cards could help with:
   - Forgetfulness (guilty… 🙋‍♂️)
   - Long-distance friendships (never have to guess time zones again!)
   - Dramatic gift fails (goodbye, weird candles or gym socks)

But…

- What are we losing?
   - The “human” guesswork (sometimes part of the charm)
   - Occasional happy accidents (when they love something you never expected)
   - The weird personal touches only a friend knows

On top of all this, does it matter WHO (or what) gave the gift if you love it? Seems like the boundaries of luxury, tech and thoughtfulness are mashing together…and I'm both fascinated and confused as heck.

Anyway. What's your take? Could you ever trust an *algorithm* to gift on your behalf? Or does this feel too Black Mirror? Would you mind if a friend sent you an AI-selected something and it was dead-on perfect? (Bonus: if anyone *actually* got a crazy gift this way, spill the story below please!)

I’m heading back to scrolling the endless gifts and stories on https://goodnovel.org/ because seriously, it might be the greatest way to test what kind of surprises I’d want curated by an all-seeing AI overlord 😂

1mmj99w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmj99w,Spent a lovely week on Patmos..,"The experience is: tourist friendly and still very much hospitable in Greek fashion. What I mean is that when you try a conversation about the island or the Greek language/history you feel the people open up to you. Try starting with “yia saas” and a smile 😃.

The port town of Skala already offers anything a tourist needs for a lazy holiday. If you want you can go to Chora and the st John monastery and cave of the apocalypse. This is the 3rd time I was there, and since approx 25 years ago the services have changed a lot for the better. Modernized and also more coffee bars and restaurants.

We stayed in Skala hotel. I can really reccommend it. It’s close to the center and harbour docks but lies in a secluded, beautiful garden with swimming pool. Very very friendly staff and they offer a very good breakfast. Also some gluten free cakes and breads are offered. For dinner you need to go elsewhere but there are plenty of options available.

Now that I left the island for another (Ikaria)  I realize the temperature is a on the cooler side for this region probably due to it’s limited size and hight(?) No scorching 35+ celsius but max 30 degrees. Also when comparing, I feel the “vibe” of Skala can best be described as Cote d’Azure with oriental touch. Lots of (see-thru) dresses, make up and strutting in the streets in the evening. But all decent and friendly, respectful, open. Also lots of children playing in the streets in the evening.
Visitors that I could discern were mainly Greek, French, German, Turkish. Less UK, Italian and Netherlands.

We also just texted like 3 to 4 messages before he asked me out so I did not even know him that much. He texted me at 8 am the next day good morning, it was the day we were supposed to meet. That morning my dog got sick since we moved to this new big city and he struggles to eat and I had to go to vet with him, I felt really worried about him so I forgot about the whole dating stuff and did not think much about it because I was really worried. Then the next day he texted me ? and I did not respond because I did not know how I should tell him that my dog currently has priority. I felt like he might not want to see me anymore if he thinks I put my dog so much before a relationship or a date. Then another day later he texted me again saying that he is curious why I disappeared and if I changed my mind that is ok but I could have told him. Then I texted him I am sorry for making you wait, I told him that my dog got sick and that I feel bad for leaving him alone too much. Then he answered but you could have told me that. Then I said you are right, I should have told you right away. Then he said that he dont think he wants to see me anymore and wishes me all the best. I answered all the best back.

I feel really sad but also angry right now. I know I did not behave well, I apologized to him, I feel angry at myself for letting this opportunity pass, but that he did not even ask if my dog is fine now and took it so personally is really disappointing too, almost like he had zero empathy for the situation. I do understand how I came across though. On the other hand, I do feel like a bit pushed by him, almost as if I had a contract with him, and that he saw this as a rejection and took it personally, although it really had nothing to do with him. I was also hesitant to meet up with him because I felt that there might be some red flags and I wasn't really sure if can trust myself or not or if I accuse him of something just because of my bad relationship experiences and choices in the past.

1mmj0dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1mmj0dt/can_the_best_vintage_toaster_from_nostalgia_live/,Can the best vintage toaster from Nostalgia live up to its charm,"Using the Nostalgia Retro Wide 2-Slice Toaster over the past few weeks has been an experience straight out of a vintage enthusiast's dream. This charming pink appliance doesn't just catch your eye with its retro design—it performs admirably in a modern kitchen too. From the get-go, I was eager to see if its functionality matched its quirky aesthetics, and I was pleasantly surprised in many ways.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
Every time I glance over at it sitting on my countertop, I can’t help but feel a small burst of joy. The stainless steel build, coated in a vivid pink shade, screams retro chic. Compact yet sturdy, its size (11""D x 6""W x 7.75""H) nestles seamlessly into my modest kitchen setup. Even my friends, who popped over for coffee, remarked about how this toaster could double as a décor piece in itself.

**Functionality and Features**  
What sets this toaster apart are the little yet impactful details. With 2 extra-wide slots, I’ve had no issue toasting thick slices of sourdough, bagels, or even frozen waffles. The five browning levels add the flexibility to toast to your heart's desire—whether you fancy slightly golden or deeply crispy slices. From soft English muffins to dense rye bread, I’ve tested it all, and it hasn’t let me down.  

[Ready to snag Nostalgia Retro Wide 2-Slice Toaster? See Amazon’s price.](https://windtoons.com/p/b0bfjyzc55/)  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Honestly, cleaning a toaster is typically something I dread, but this product makes it hassle-free. The crumb tray slides out smoothly, giving me quick access for a clean scoop-and-dump operation. No mess left behind, which is a massive plus for someone like me who cooks and hates finding old crumbs weeks later.

**Lighted Controls and Button Layout**  
The illuminated control buttons were another delightful surprise. Whether I press the bagel, defrost, or cancel options, the glowing feedback makes it clear which setting I've chosen. It feels intuitive and user-friendly, even for the not-so-tech-savvy members of my family. I’ve even noticed my coworker, who stayed over for brunch, giving it a test ride, and he didn’t have to ask for instructions.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact yet eye-catching retro design that adds flair to any kitchen  
- 900 watts of power toast bread evenly and quickly  
- Wide slots accommodate various bread types  
- Easily adjustable browning levels for perfect toast every time  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Crumb tray, while convenient, could have been larger to prevent frequent emptying  
- Toasting isn’t perfectly even on both sides for certain thick slices  
- The cord storage is handy but can feel cramped when wrapping a longer cable  

**Optional Add-On Features I Wish Were Included**  
One thing that crossed my mind is the lack of a reheat function, which could’ve been perfect to warm forgotten slices without further browning. That, and maybe a matching dome-shaped kettle? Come on, how perfect would that pair look?

**Competitors**  
When comparing this toaster to options like the Cuisinart CPT-180 or the Dash Clear View, the unique retro aesthetic of Nostalgia stands out. While the Cuisinart offers a sleek modern look and 4-slice capacity, it lacks the quirky charm that makes the Nostalgia toaster a conversation starter. Dash Clear View, with its transparent window, provides a unique function for visually monitoring your toast, but it sacrifices compactness. I’d argue if personality in design is as important to you as reliable performance, this pink toe-tapper wins hands down.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its price point, this toaster feels justified in what it offers. Many alternatives with similar aesthetics and functionalities tend to cost more, leaving you to splurge for the design without any extra utility. With Nostalgia, you get a perfect balance between form and usability. Even with minor flaws, I’d call this product an ideal mix of affordability and style.

# Best iPhone 16 Pro Max Case with Card Holder 2025

The iPhone 16 Pro Max is undoubtedly going to be a highly sought-after device, and protecting it is paramount. A case with a card holder offers not only protection but also convenience, allowing users to carry essential cards without needing a separate wallet. This review focuses on the best iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders expected to be available in 2025, considering protection, functionality, design, and overall value. We aim to provide a complete guide to help you choose the perfect case to safeguard your investment and streamline your everyday carry.

[[Explore Top Rated iphone 16 pro max case with card holder on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=iphone 16 pro max case with card holder)

## Key Features Analysis

The iPhone 16 Pro Max case with a card holder must offer a blend of protection and functionality. Here we break down critical features to consider before selecting the ideal case.**Drop Protection:** A crucial aspect for any phone case is its ability to withstand drops and impacts. Effective cases utilize materials like TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) and Polycarbonate, frequently enough in multi-layered designs, to absorb shock and protect the phone from damage. The impact resistance should be certified with standards like MIL-STD-810G, indicating the case has passed rigorous drop tests. Specifically, a good case should protect your iPhone 16 Pro Max from drops up to 10 feet.

**Card Capacity & Accessibility:** The card holder component should securely hold at least 2-3 cards (credit cards, ID, etc.) without adding excessive bulk. A sliding or flip-open design allows for easy access to the cards, while ensuring they remain securely in place during normal use. The mechanism should operate smoothly and reliably,avoiding accidental card ejection. The case should ideally accommodate embossed cards without jamming or damaging the mechanism.**Material Quality & Durability:** The overall durability of the case depends heavily on the materials used. Premium materials like full-grain leather, durable polycarbonate, and reinforced TPU offer both aesthetic appeal and long-lasting protection.The selected material should be resistant to scratches, impacts, and wear and tear from daily use. The material’s finish should enhance grip to help prevent accidental drops.

**Wireless Charging compatibility:** The convenience of wireless charging has become a standard feature for premium smartphones. An ideal case should be thin enough or utilize materials that don't interfere with wireless charging capabilities. Cases that are too thick or contain metallic elements in the wrong places may block or substantially slow down the charging process. Ensure full compatibility with both Qi-certified chargers and MagSafe chargers.

**Camera & Screen Protection:** Elevated edges around the camera lenses and screen are essential for preventing scratches when placing the phone on surfaces. A raised bezel of at least 1.5mm around the screen and individual lens protectors are recommended for optimal safeguarding. Additional features such as reinforced corners and internal cushioning further enhance impact protection.

**Precise Cutouts & Button Responsiveness:** The case should feature precise cutouts for all ports, speakers, and buttons, ensuring unobstructed access and functionality. Buttons should remain easy to press and responsive,providing tactile feedback. Poorly designed cutouts can obstruct charging cables or interfere with speaker audio quality.

**Streamlined Carry:** Combining phone protection with a card holder eliminates the need for a separate wallet, reducing bulk in your pockets or bag. This is particularly beneficial for errands, events, or situations where you want to travel light. Carrying a driver's licence, credit card, and transportation card directly on your phone minimizes the risk of misplaced or forgotten wallets.

**Enhanced Security:** Keeping essential cards securely attached to your phone can reduce the risk of theft or loss compared to carrying a traditional wallet. many cases feature hidden card compartments or secure locking mechanisms that deter unauthorized access. This added security provides peace of mind in crowded public spaces or while traveling.

**Increased Convenience:** Having easy access to your moast frequently used cards directly on your phone streamlines transactions and everyday tasks. Whether it's paying for coffee, tapping into public transit, or showing your ID, the integrated card holder provides speedy and convenient access. This eliminates the need to fumble through a wallet or purse, saving time and effort.

**Protection and Style Combined:** These cases offer excellent protection for your iPhone 16 Pro Max without compromising on style. Cases made from premium materials like leather or carbon fiber not only protect your investment but also complement the phone's design. The integration of a card holder doesn't necessarily add bulk and may even enhance the overall aesthetic of the case.

**Reduced Digital Clutter:** With fewer items to manage, this case helps create a more minimalistic and organized lifestyle. By consolidating essential cards with your phone, you reduce the mental load of tracking multiple items. This contributes to a simpler,more streamlined daily routine.

## FAQs Section

**Will the card holder damage my credit cards?**
No, reputable cases are designed with materials and mechanisms that prevent damage to the magnetic strips or chips on credit cards. The compartments are lined with protective materials to avoid scratching or demagnetizing your cards. Ensure the card holder has a snug fit to prevent cards from rubbing against each other.

**Does the card holder add much bulk to the phone?**
Many manufacturers have successfully minimized the added bulk through thoughtful design. Slim profile cases with integrated card holders add only a few millimeters of thickness.Look for cases that optimize space utilization and use lightweight materials.

**Is the card holder secure enough to prevent cards from falling out?**
Yes, most cases feature secure locking mechanisms, tight-fitting compartments, or sliding designs that prevent cards from accidentally falling out. Models using spring-loaded mechanisms or friction locks are typically more secure. Check user reviews for feedback on the card holder's security.

**can I still use NFC with a card in the holder?**
NFC functionality can be impacted depending on the thickness and material of the case and the position of the card. Some cases are specifically designed with cutouts or optimized materials to allow for seamless NFC payments, even with cards in the holder. Check the manufacturer's specifications for NFC compatibility.

We also just texted like 3 to 4 messages before he asked me out so I did not even know him that much. He texted me at 8 am the next day good morning, it was the day we were supposed to meet. That morning my dog got sick since we moved to this new big city and he struggles to eat and I had to go to vet with him, I felt really worried about him so I forgot about the whole dating stuff and did not think much about it because I was really worried. Then the next day he texted me ? and I did not respond because I did not know how I should tell him that my dog currently has priority. I felt like he might not want to see me anymore if he thinks I put my dog so much before a relationship or a date. Then another day later he texted me again saying that he is curious why I disappeared and if I changed my mind that is ok but I could have told him. Then I texted him I am sorry for making you wait, I told him that my dog got sick and that I feel bad for leaving him alone too much. Then he answered but you could have told me that. Then I said you are right, I should have told you right away. Then he said that he dont think he wants to see me anymore and wishes me all the best. I answered all the best back. 

I feel really sad but also angry right now. I know I did not behave well, I apologized to him, I feel angry at myself for letting this opportunity pass, but that he did not even ask if my dog is fine now and took it so personally is really disappointing too, almost like he had zero empathy for the situation. I do understand how I came across though. On the other hand, I do feel like a bit pushed by him, almost as if I had a contract with him, and that he saw this as a rejection and took it personally, although it really had nothing to do with him. I was also hesitant to meet up with him because I felt that there might be some red flags and I wasn't really sure if can trust myself or not or if I accuse him of something just because of my bad relationship experiences and choices in the past.

Quite a lot happened in the past month. I adopted a cat recently, M, male, 1.5 years old.

My girlfriend moved in in the same month, bringing her own cat, P, female, 7 years old.

We brought them in around the same time, did the slow introductions. Everything was fine at first. Occasionally M chased P around because he wanted to play with her. He'll ignore us trying to play in favor of her, but she wants none of it. Hissing and smacking him when he gets too close, then running to hide under the bed or coffee table.

Now, he's started going for the front of her neck and pouncing on her. He's not trying to mount her or anything, both are fixed. We've separated them to see if it helps, but this morning, as soon as they saw each other, he IMMEDIATELY went for her neck. I can't tell if he's playing or trying to assert his dominance, but P keeps hiding and won't come out to eat. 

We had to get her a special feeder that only opens for her collar because he would go and eat her food before she could.

I've been a cat owner before, but it's been a good 10 years since I last had cats. My girlfriend, who's had P literally since the day she was born, is very protective over her and doesn't want him pouncing or biting at her. As far as we're concerned, no blood has been drawn, but we're worried it will.

I had parked in what looked like a quiet public lot on the edge of a small town, nice lighting, not too many vehicles, and close to a coffee shop I planned to visit in the morning. Everything felt perfect, until midnight.

That’s when the music started. Loud bass thumping from cars that kept pulling in and out. Groups talking and sometimes yelling right outside. At one point, I heard knocking on a nearby vehicle, not mine, thankfully, but close enough to keep my nerves on edge.

By 3 a.m., I had barely slept, constantly peeking through the blinds like some kind of RV security guard. It made me realize that in RV living, the real challenge isn’t just finding a spot to park, it’s finding one that stays peaceful through the night.

For the experienced RV folks here, how do you pick your overnight spots to avoid this kind of thing? Are there warning signs or little tricks you use to figure out if a place is going to be noisy before committing to it?",2,1754833255.0,RVLiving,3,0.75,False
1mmiv1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mmiv1u/how_does_the_nehilumn_208mc1_coffee_maker_perform/,How does the Nehilumn 208-MC1 coffee maker perform in this detailed review?,"**Testing the Nehilumn 208-MC1 Single Serve Coffee Maker**  

The Nehilumn 208-MC1 Single Serve Coffee Maker has been my go-to appliance for the past few weeks. As someone who appreciates a hot cup of coffee to jumpstart the day, I found its compact and versatile design immediately appealing. This 2-in-1 coffee machine is compatible with both K-Cup pods and ground coffee, which suited my indecisiveness perfectly. Whether I used pre-filled pods or freshly ground beans, the machine delivered brewed coffee in just a few minutes. From its user-friendly interface to its space-saving build, here’s my detailed experience.

**Design & Space Efficiency**  

Living in a small apartment, counter space is prime real estate. This coffee maker’s compact dimensions—7.28"" deep, 5.24"" wide, and 12.2"" high—meant it fit snugly into a tight corner of my kitchen without overpowering the counter space. The design is sleek and minimalistic in its black exterior, making it blend seamlessly with other kitchen appliances. Although compact, the unit didn’t feel flimsy; the solid construction gave me confidence it could hold up to regular usage. Moreover, the detachable drip tray allowed me to fit my travel mug underneath, a feature I found super useful during rushed mornings.  

****Check out the [Nehilumn 208-MC1 Single Serve Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0czr46s9m/)  

**Performance & Brewing Options**  

As far as performance goes, the one-touch brewing system proved to be a game-changer. A single button starts the brewing process, and within three minutes, there’s a steaming cup of coffee waiting. Unlike some machines that get loud while brewing, this model maintained a quiet hum—something my early-rising roommate definitely appreciated.  

Its ability to brew both K-Cup pods and ground coffee added versatility to my mornings. I had the freedom to enjoy the convenience of a pod on busy days or experiment with different coffee blends using the reusable mesh filter. Though the brewing doesn’t produce café-like crema, the flavor was robust and consistent.  

**Water Tank Capacity**  

The water tank is designed for a one-cup capacity, ranging from 6 to 14 ounces depending on the cup size. I loved the idea of customizing how much coffee to brew, especially since some mornings called for a smaller boost while others demanded a full travel mug. However, having to refill the water tank for each cup did seem like extra work at times, especially if I wanted to prepare a second cup immediately.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  

Cleaning was straightforward thanks to removable components. The reusable filter, K-Cup holder, and drip tray came off easily and could be rinsed under the faucet. For a deeper clean, I found even stubborn coffee stains scrubbed off nicely. Decalcifying the machine every couple of months, though, might feel like an extra step if you’re used to maintenance-free options.  

**Highlights**  

- Compact design saves counter space.  
- Supports both ground coffee and K-Cups.  
- Customizable brewing size from 6 to 14 oz.  
- Brewing finishes in under 3 minutes.  
- Removable drip tray accommodates travel mugs.  

**Downsides**  

- Small water tank requires frequent refills.  
- Brewing doesn’t deliver barista-style crema.  
- Decalcification maintenance needed every 1-2 months.  

**Competing Products**  

Comparing this coffee machine to competitors like the Keurig K-Mini and Black+Decker single-serve brewers highlighted some interesting contrasts. The Keurig K-Mini offered a similar compact form but lacked the flexibility for ground coffee without buying separate accessories. While the Black+Decker model was slightly less expensive, the Nehilumn 208-MC1 outperformed it in brewing speed and customization options. One downside is that some higher-end competitors include nicer features like strength customization, but those come at a steeper price tag.  

**Price Performance**  

In terms of value, this coffee maker sits comfortably in an affordable price bracket while offering a lot of features for casual coffee drinkers or minimal-space setups. The addition of reusable filters means a smaller ongoing cost compared to machines reliant solely on pre-packaged pods. For its price point, it balances versatility, compactness, and ease of use adeptly.

1mmiuue,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mmiuue/can_the_kitchenaid_kek1222pt_electric_kettle/,Can the KitchenAid KEK1222PT Electric Kettle Transform Your Tea Routine?,"Whenever I add a new gadget to my kitchen, I always like to test it out thoroughly to see if it lives up to its hype. The KitchenAid KEK1222PT is one such gadget that immediately caught my eye because of its compact design and charming pistachio color. Right out of the box, its retro aesthetics give off a timeless appeal, complementing modern and vintage kitchen setups alike. However, as much as I’ve enjoyed using it daily for my tea rituals, there are a few things worth mentioning about its features and usability.

**Style and Design Appeal**  
I have to admit, the design is what initially drew me to this electric kettle. Its glossy pistachio finish paired with a smooth aluminum handle exudes elegance, making it the centerpiece of my countertop. The 1.25-liter capacity feels perfect for my daily needs. Whether I am making tea for myself or a few cups for guests, it’s big enough without taking over precious counter space. The stainless steel body feels sturdy in hand, though the single-wall construction means it gets quite hot to touch after boiling water. A quick word of caution—if you're clumsy in the kitchen like me, you might want to be mindful of that.  

[Check KitchenAid KEK1222PT price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b012wf88qs/)  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
What I love most about this kettle is its user-friendly approach. The LED on/off switch is as straightforward as it gets. The removable base with cord storage was a delightful surprise, allowing me to store it neatly without cords tangling everywhere. One of its standout features is the removable lid, which is slightly old-school but charming in its own right. However, I find it slightly inconvenient when compared to flip-top lids that many modern models feature. That said, cleaning the kettle is relatively straightforward—a blessing for someone who despises scrubbing kitchen gadgets endlessly.  

**Boiling Speed and Performance**  
In terms of performance, the KitchenAid electric kettle does not disappoint. It heats water quickly and efficiently, shaving precious minutes off my morning routine. I did notice that it maintains a consistent boil, delivering just the right temperature for everything from herbal teas to instant soups. However, the kettle doesn’t include temperature controls, which might be a downside for coffee aficionados or matcha lovers who need precise heat adjustments.  

**Pros**  
- Retro-inspired, compact design adds charm to any kitchen  
- Stainless steel body ensures durability  
- Removable base with cord storage enhances practicality  
- Energy-efficient and quick boiling for daily use  

**Relatable Downsides**  
- Single-wall construction makes the exterior hot to touch  
- Absence of temperature control limits versatility  
- A fixed removable lid may feel dated for some users  

**How it Compares to Alternatives**  
I’ve owned my fair share of electric kettles, and two brands come to mind as competitors: Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart. Both offer similarly priced models with more bells and whistles, especially in terms of temperature control. A model like the Hamilton Beach 1.7L kettle boasts programmable settings for different beverages, while the Cuisinart CPK-17 goes one step further with a keep-warm function. However, neither matches the nostalgic design of this KitchenAid kettle. If aesthetics and simplicity matter more to you than a few extra features, this might still edge out the others in your book.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This kettle sits right in the middle of budget-friendly and premium options. Its features justify the investment if you're leaning towards something durable and visually appealing. While it doesn’t come with all the high-tech elements some may want, the timeless design and practical functionality offer a lot for minimal fuss. For me, it felt worth the splurge.

1mmisle,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mmisle/reveal_the_best_electric_kettle_cuisinart/,Reveal the Best Electric Kettle Cuisinart PerfecTemp Worth Buying,"Cuisinart CPK-20 arrived at my doorstep in a shiny stainless steel finish, promising to revolutionize my tea and coffee rituals. As someone obsessed with brewing the perfect cup of tea, I couldn't wait to test its touted precision and utility. Did this kettle live up to my expectations? Here’s what I discovered through weeks of daily use.

**Intuitive Design with Sleek Aesthetics**  
The polished stainless steel finish caught my eye immediately. It brings modern elegance to the kitchen, fitting seamlessly with other appliances. A cool-to-touch, non-slip handle made it comfortable to lift even with a full pot. The 360-degree swivel base? A game-changer. It made placing it back super easy from any direction, a huge perk during my half-asleep morning routine. The blue backlit LCD was not just functional but added a futuristic vibe I didn’t know I needed. Its compact 1.7-liter size feels just right, neither bulky nor too small, and suits both everyday use and hosting friends.

**Tailored Temperature Control for Tea and Coffee Lovers**  
What sets this kettle apart is the six preset temperature settings. Whether it's delicate white tea or robust French press coffee, it nails the optimal temperature every time. I appreciated the customization option for adjusting the heat from 71 to 100 degrees Celsius, as my partner prefers slightly cooler herbal brews. Testing this feature across black, green, oolong teas, and even hot chocolate gave consistent results every single time.

**[Check Cuisinart CPK-20 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0cfvmd7r7/)**  

**Performance That Speaks Volumes**  
This kettle packs a solid 1500 watts of power, which translates to water heating in record time. It’s incredibly efficient, boiling a full pot faster than any previous electric kettle I’ve used. Having the ""Keep Warm"" feature retain heat for 30 minutes was another pleasant discovery. On late work nights, I didn’t have to reboil the water; it was ready whenever I needed it. The ""hold mode"" feature was another element I grew fond of. Lifting the kettle off the base pauses the cycle, and once placed back, it resumes effortlessly. There’s no fuss, just seamless functionality.

**Advantages**  
- Preset and customizable temperature settings for precision brewing  
- Boils water incredibly fast (thank you, 1500-watt power!)  
- Blue backlit LCD is both stylish and practical  
- Keep Warm functionality ensures consistently hot water for 30 minutes  

**Flaws**  
While I genuinely enjoyed using the kettle, I did come across certain quirks.  
- The audible alert notifying you when the water is ready might disturb light sleepers during early mornings.  
- Some reviewers online expressed concerns about long-term durability, but I didn’t experience that in my usage so far.  
- The glossy stainless steel tends to attract fingerprints, necessitating frequent wiping to maintain its immaculate appearance.  

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Cleaning the kettle? Surprisingly hassle-free. Its polished exterior only demands occasional wiping with a clean cloth. Inside, the design prevents limescale buildup better than most kettles I’ve owned, provided I regularly empty leftover water.

**Market Rivals**  
In comparing the Cuisinart CPK-20 to similar products, the Breville Temp Select kettle came to mind. Both offer similar temperature control features, but I found the user interface on this model to be more intuitive. The Breville, while larger, lacks the sleek compactness and polished look that Cuisinart offers. On the flip side, Breville’s handle feels a bit sturdier. If silent operation is critical for you, the KitchenAid Electric Kettle is quieter but sacrifices some of the versatility provided here.

**Affordable Quality**  
Given everything this kettle offers, its price point feels justified. It balances top-tier performance, convenience, and elegant design. Compared to simpler, no-frills kettles on the market, it’s a step up but well worth the slight splurge. Whether you’re a tea aficionado or just someone looking for reliable convenience in their kitchen, you’ll find value in every feature.

some background: we're a team of 6 people under this manager (40s male). jessica started maybe 2 weeks before me so we're both pretty new but somehow she's already his golden child.



here's the bs i deal with daily:



jessica comes in late almost every morning, like 9:30 when we start at 9. meanwhile i showed up 5 minutes late once bc of traffic and got a whole lecture about ""professionalism and punctuality."" she gets coffee runs that take 45 minutes and somehow that's fine but if i take more than 30 mins for lunch i get side eyes.



yesterday was the worst tho. we had this big client campaign presentation and i spent 3 days working on the research and strategy part. really detailed stuff, stayed late to make sure everything was perfect. jessica did some basic slides with graphics i had already put together.



guess who got all the praise in front of the client? ""jessica really went above and beyond on this campaign, her creative vision is exceptional."" i'm sitting right there like wtf. the client even asked specific questions about my research and the boss goes ""oh yes jessica's team did great work on that"" like i dont even exist.



after the meeting jessica comes up to me all fake sweet ""thanks for helping with the data"" HELPING?? i did 90% of the actual work while she made it look pretty.



the kicker is she makes comments during meetings that are straight up wrong about basic marketing stuff and he just nods along. when i tried to correct something she said about conversion rates last week he shut me down with ""lets stay focused on the bigger picture.""



other coworkers have noticed too. sarah pulled me aside yesterday and was like ""this favoritism thing is getting crazy"" but nobodys gonna say anything bc we all need our jobs.



jessica also gets the good client accounts while i'm stuck doing social media posting and admin work. she got to go to that conference in denver last month while i had to cover her regular work too. she posts pics on instagram at fancy restaurants ""client dinner!"" while i'm here till 7pm fixing her campaign mistakes.



the worst part is i actually like the job and im good at it. my campaigns perform well and i get along with everyone else. but this favoritism is making me dread coming in every day. ive started looking at other agencies bc this environment is toxic af.

The humidity was really bad yesterday and my
hair waking up was very frizzy. I have curly hair so anytime humidity comes into play my hair looks like a mess. I do every other day washing for my hair as over washing it causes me to itchy like crazy. So I skipped over doing a full wash and instead just doing basic conditioner in my hair. 

At first husband didn’t say anything. Seemed like he was ok and just having a good day. It wasn’t until my hair started dry and he asked if I washed it. 

I’m sure people will ask why he asks if I wash my hair. I use to work at a public pool back in the day that ruined my hair for a while due to
The chlorine. It’s been better since I quit that job years ago but it took a very long time for the hair to rebound. This is while we were dating and he said the pool ruined my hair. 5 years later after quitting he constantly looks at it. I let it naturally dry as hair dryers also make
My head itch like crazy and I have burned myself several times with cheap ones. It also makes my curls feel more natural and less fizzy. He sometimes will try to take a brush to
It saying my hair looks better with a brush. I feel like he takes after mom who was very anal
About my own hair (hairdresser) and nitpicked at it similar to her. 

When we went out at public yesterday husband was a bit tense. It went ok until an employee at a store asked if I liked classic cars. I was wearing a yellow t shirt with an older ford car on it and I said “why yes I do!” We had a brief conversation talking about some cars all while husband stands there quiet. When we left I mentioned how the employees were chatty today and husband goes “yeah well they seem to be staring at you constantly.” I was taken a back and asked what he meant. He says “it’s so embarrassing that you didn’t wash your hair and you chatted with someone and they think you looked like you just rolled out of bed.” I was left stunned and looked down at my clothes. I wore blue shorts with that yellow car shirt and tennis
Shoes so I looked like I was normal. He then went on to say “see I look at women and they just don’t dress like you. They have their hair
Neat, wear cute clothes and actaully wash themselves and present way more nicely.” I started to internally cry. I went quiet and just looked down. I reminder quiet for the rest of the day.

Today I woke up hoping it was going to be a good day. Husband brought up coffee and said “before we go grocery shopping today, I hope you considered washing your hair because you didn’t yesterday. I don’t want to go out in public again with you looking that way.” I told him if he was going to be nasty to me today then I don’t want to go and he can go by himself if he thinks that way of me. He says he wanted me to go but doesn’t want to be  embarrassed again. I told him straight up “then I won’t go out in public with you if you see me that way. We can just go by ourselves and you can keep your ego.” He left the room upset but at this point I don’t care. I’m tired of him nitpicking me and being nasty. He also teases saying women look at him and thinks they’re going to hit on him cause if he goes out without me the women will crawl to him. I just shake my head at that response because even my autistic brain thinks that’s a ridiculous thing, what woman will just go up to him and hit on him at a store or fast food place? I wouldn’t, would any other girl do that? 

Does my husband have some weird complex with me going out in public? Or is this some sort of anxiety thing he has or ego thing? Am
I overreacting to this or do I really stand out if I don’t wash my hair and choose “odd” clothing? 

Also as a side question to women - are graphic t-shirts and shorts a “normal” dress wear or is this not acceptable to wear out in public spaces? (Talking grocery stores, coffee shops etc.)

1mmipyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1mmipyl/what_makes_the_drinkmate_lux_soda_maker_stand_out/,What Makes the Drinkmate LUX Soda Maker Stand Out from the Competition?,"**Testing the DrinkMate LUX 710-20-14Zx2-PP1 in Real-Time: My Personal Experience**

Trying out the DrinkMate LUX 710-20-14Zx2-PP1 was an exciting dive into the world of sparkling beverages. I’ve tested a fair share of soda makers before, but this one, with its sleek stainless steel design and patented Fizz Infuser technology, stood out as something special. The idea of carbonating not just water but any beverage had an irresistible appeal to me. Who wouldn’t be intrigued by the prospect of turning juice or flat soda into something sparkling and refreshing?

**Design That Steals the Spotlight**

Few kitchen gadgets can claim to combine efficiency with elegance, and this soda maker excels at both. The stainless steel finish of the DrinkMate LUX adds a level of sophistication that seamlessly blends into any kitchen decor. It’s compact enough to sit comfortably on my crowded countertop without feeling intrusive, and the brushed silver appearance makes it look more like a piece of modern art than a functional appliance. Moreover, the stainless steel bottle, which is dishwasher-safe and insulated, promises colder drinks for longer durations—a feature I found especially handy on warm summer days.

**How the Patented Fizz Infuser Enhances the Experience**

The Fizz Infuser technology is, without question, a game-changer. Traditional soda makers mostly work with plain water, but this innovation allowed me to carbonate nearly anything. I had a smirk on my face when I carbonated apple juice the other day—it was a bubbly revelation. The slow-release mechanism of the Fizz Infuser prevents any wild eruptions, ensuring a mess-free experience, which I cannot stress enough. Cleaning spills from sugary drinks isn’t fun, so I appreciated how effectively the pressure release system worked.

**Check [DrinkMate 710-20-14Zx2-PP1] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Versatility**

Testing it across several drink types revealed consistent carbonation quality. Whether I tried sparkling up cold brew coffee for a unique pick-me-up or resuscitated some leftover Prosecco, the results were nothing short of impressive. The carbonation either matched or exceeded the fizz level achieved by competing products, leaving me quite satisfied. The dual-wall insulation of the 0.7L bottle extended the lifespan of my chilled beverages well beyond what I had anticipated. Despite being manual, the operation mode was straightforward—anyone could use it without a steep learning curve.

**Highlights**

- Sleek stainless steel design enhances the aesthetic of any kitchen.
- Patented Fizz Infuser technology allows carbonation of a wide range of beverages.
- Compact design that doesn’t hog counter space.
- Insulated carbonating bottle keeps drinks cold for longer durations.

**Shortcomings**

- Some users might find the capacity of 0.7 liters slightly limiting for larger households.
- Refilling CO2 cylinders can be inconvenient if you frequently carbonate drinks.
- The manual operation might not appeal to those accustomed to fully automated systems.

**Competing Brands**

While putting the DrinkMate LUX to the test, I couldn’t help but think of other soda makers such as SodaStream Terra and Aarke Carbonator III. SodaStream products often dictate the market, but they limit users to carbonating water only. The DrinkMate LUX trumps that limitation with its “carbonate anything” versatility. On the other hand, Aarke models match DrinkMate in terms of premium aesthetics but lack the Fizz Infuser’s patented technology, which is a significant edge for carbonation enthusiasts like me. However, Aarke offers slightly larger bottle capacities, which might sway those who prefer serving family-sized drinks in one go.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering the functionality and build quality, this product offers excellent value for its price range. It’s not just a soda maker; it’s a multipurpose carbonation system that invites creativity into every sip. Yes, it might cost more than basic models, but its ability to carbonate anything—paired with the durable, stylish stainless steel design—makes it worth the extra bucks. This felt less like a splurge and more like an investment in my daily drinking experiences.

She spoke vaguely about her previous night at the breakfast table with her blue eyes narrowed from too little sleep, her thick eyelashes sparkly from years and years of lakeside summers. She was born there, just an hour away and when May came, so did the weekends in Keyhaven. Her summer glow never had time to fade.


Maeve put on a bikini as soon as she got up from the hundreds of mismatched ones on the floor of her room even though her skin would get all prickly from the early morning chill. She wore two sizes smaller than me, she was much shorter too. Petite and athletic because she played all sorts of sports and played them well. She was also a top student. Better than me. 

Everyone including her told me we looked like sisters but I found it insulting. We did not look alike. She was sculpted with precision while I lumped and hunched with the same features having little means to extracurriculars.


Maeve could walk out the door and on a whim collect almost six friends for frolicking, playing Uno or cruising on someone's speed boat. Despite my aunt's efforts to make me go hang out with her, I didn't want to meddle with Maeve's social circle—she was cool about it though—but also I didn't want to hang out with younger kids that were too cool for me. Instead I put on my headphones and gloomed around the porch during my first weekend.


The piece of Keyhaven my aunt's house was located in, had afternoon shade with the rolling hill cluttered with lanky pine trees leaning toward the lake just behind. 

The sweet breeze would slap your skin by three and it was surreal sitting on an ancient wooden chair with sturdy legs and watching the lake from ten feet above.

Sometimes I'd continue staying there long after the sun set despite the mosquitos and would listen to kids my age meeting at the shore, splashing, singing and screaming and laughing and God knows what else. I desperately wanted to just be able to walk down the slippery path down and say a simple, “Hey, mind if I join?”


On my home turf, I would have. That was how I made friends easily. Just daring to say hey. The reason mostly stemmed from being away from my homogenically lower to middle income school population. A nagging inferior complex, if you will.


My parents left early on Monday morning. Mom hugged me right before getting into our beat-up Kia and whispered in my ear, “You try and have fun, bunny.” Her eyes reddened. “I know maybe you don’t have any friends here, but take advantage of these couple of weeks.”


I rolled my eyes and pulled back, but she tugged me right back to her eye level. “I’m serious,” she said. “Go jump in the water. Hang out with the kids. You can resume brooding when you get back home.”


She glanced toward the porch where my aunt was fussing with her hydrangeas. “Your aunt’s trying, you know. Give her some grace.”


“You mean like introducing me to her dinner guests as ‘the one who wants to go to med school,’ like I’m a brochure for overcoming adversity?”


Mom pressed her lips together, trying not to laugh. “She meant well. She’s proud of you. Have you thought maybe it is the only thing she knows about you? You barely talk.”


“Cool,” I muttered. “Nothing says fun summer like opening up to your extended family.”


Dad shut the trunk with a thump and threw his arm around my neck. “It’s a fair bargain,” he said. “This place is perfect for getting your first heartbreak.”  


“Dad!” I shoved his chest a little. “You know I'm a hardcore realist.”

“Yeah,” said dad, placing a kiss over my crown. “You’re the only person I know who loves Balzac.”


I stepped back and watched them drive away with a smirk. A subtle wave later made my way towards the woods. With breakfast being at least two hours away, I wanted to see this supposed magical place through a new lens. The brown pine needles crunched under my flip flops, occasionally stabbing my feet. I thought about the kids that usually sprinted around bare feet among the tree trunks and over the sturdy rocks. Posh savages with hobbit feet. 

I pushed my hands into my pockets and walked deeper to my right. I assumed if I took the thin trail behind the cabin, I'd eventually turn up at the cove Maeve took as with the boat the other day.

When I saw the reeds, I picked up my pace and soon the sandy ground became squishy like a soaked Turkish rug. The woods eventually opened up to a tiny sandy beach. I kicked the cheap plastic off my feet and ran knee deep. It was freezing. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath in. A smile broke on my face. A piece of heaven. 

Silent, still, pristine and mine.

At this time of the day, at least, only mine. 

The courage bubbled up to my throat, and came out in a squeal as I stripped off my hoodie. I turned and threw it to the shore as hard as I could. After hopping back to remove my jean shorts and baggy t-shirt, I figured I was about to skinny dip for the first time in my life. The reed fanned out around me anyway.

“Way to go Lynn,” I cheered on. “I’m proud of you!” 

I felt free as a bird when my naked body dived into the glacially cold water. 


***


Around two, Maeve knocked on my door frame and leaned in, “We’re playing on the porch. You coming?”


I was about to go for the classic, nah, I'm good. But I was bored out of my mind so I followed her out with, sounds good.


Six kids were gathered around a low table on the porch, legs tucked under them, holding plastic cups of lemonade and passing around a bag of kettle corn. Maeve plopped down cross-legged between two boys, then looked up at me and patted the space next to her.


“Lynn, this is everyone,” she said. “Everyone, this is my cousin, Lynn from the city.”


“Hey Lynn from the city,” said a girl in a tie-dye tank top, flashing a peace sign. “I'm Bettany.” A boy with curly red hair handed me my cards. No one asked me anything. They just made room. It was strange and kind of nice.

They were so loud. They laughed at everything—at the way Maeve kept forgetting to say “Uno,” at how Owen always tried to cheat and always got caught, at nothing at all. It made me feel like I’d stumbled into the middle of a group of siblings. There were inside jokes flying like firecrackers, but no one seemed to care if you didn’t catch all of them. Someone laid down a +4 and the whole circle erupted in outrage. I laughed so much, I had to run to pee.


We were wrapping up a round, when Maeve said, masterfully shuffling the cards, “Oh, Marla’s having a party tonight, by the way. We should go.”


I blinked. I could already feel the excuses lining up in my throat but Maeve beat me to it with sharper ones.

Everyone was going.

My aunt thought I needed to get out more.

It would be fun.


“What do I wear?” I groaned.


Bettany waved that off. “You can wear whatever. It’s not a big deal...”


Maeve nodded at me with big doe eyes.


“Okay...” I shrugged. I've wanted to meet this Marla girl they kept mentioning around the table anyway. The one who got into Harvard.

 

“I'll treat it as a social experiment.”


And an experiment it was.


I admit, I had not been to a house party or a bonfire or anything like that before. But I assumed whatever the kids back home threw, could not come close to this. 

There was a freaking DJ. 

A proper buffet was set on the front deck. 


Marla's house was a granite colored modern mansion and the premises were expansive, opening up to a fire pit on one side and a lawn on the opposite. When Maeve and her friends went to mingle, I sat on a wooden seat surrounding the trunk of an ancient oak tree to observe my peers. 


The boys had their hair slicked back, and the girls had lip gloss and a cloud of perfume trailing behind. They were a different type of shiny in the night time with their orthodontist-manicured teeth and unbuttoned linen shirts. 


Although they told me it wasn't, it was apparently a big deal. Both Maeve and Bettany disappeared after Uno till it was time to leave the house and I sadly realized they got their hair and make up done a little too late. 

I left wearing a black graphic tee over my jean shorts and prayed that I blended in with the paysage. 

Suddenly, the innocent kids on the porch were replaced by a version of themselves that laughed a little too hard at boys' jokes and strolled around for attention in mini dresses. 

About thirty minutes in, Maeve and Bettany came running down the upstairs deck. “Marla wants to meet you,” Maeve giggled as if it was the presidential summon. “Come on,” she caught my hand. “They are sitting by the fire.”


I felt like it was my debutante ball if Queens kids had debutante balls. 

Marla and about ten other people were chatting by the firepit. Some were lounging on chaise-longues spread across the lawn, drinking bubbles from clear plastic cups, and some like Marla, the goddess herself, were standing near the buffet table, picking at the finger food.


Bettany went and snuggled up to Marla. To be specific, her tall brunette sister. So, I thought, that is how Maeve got invited. Marla looked elegant, I have to say. With all my prejudice, I expected a generic queen bee with bleach blond hair but she had a simple short bob, sharp dark brown eyebrows and dark lashes. Although in a simple make up, she looked absolutely stunning in a light blue chiffon dress. She turned to me with a smile.

 “Oh, hi!” She beamed, extending her hand. “You must be Lynn.” 

I shook her hand as self conscious as I could get and possibly flushed. 

“Nice to meet you all,” I said to everyone around with a meek wave.


Marla then turned to her friends and called out to a boy sitting on a bench, his arm draped over a blond girl, laughing. 


“Hey Eli! We've got another New Yorker here.”


Eli's smile froze on his face. Then, he looked up and smiled mischievously. “Hey,” he waved, getting up. He approached me lazily as Marla quipped, “He's a LaGuardia graduate off to nowhere.”


He had dark blue shorts under a faded blue t-shirt and his hair was a mess of dark waves. And despite the boyish hunch he carried, he looked like a full size man, a famished one, not fully developed into his body. But an epitome of chill and confidence, nonetheless. 


“I've seen you at the cove this morning,” he said, smirking after a breath. “I, too, am usually proud of myself for skinny dipping.”


My breath caught in my chest. It felt like everyone gasped momentarily. Maeve had that look on her face that said, “Really? You sure it was her?” 

It was so ridiculous, I burst out laughing.


“Astoria,” he said, extending his hand finally. 

“Flushing,” I replied and took it with confidence.


“Nice to meet you Flushing,” he nodded with mock reverence. “You really are, by the way.”


“I know,” I deadpanned.


“It's Lynn.” Marla added. “Well, come on…” She gave Eli a push from behind. “Give her a tour around.”


Eli raised an eyebrow at Marla’s command. “You've got it, boss.” 

He led the way with mock chivalry. “Shall we, Lady Flushing?”


“So, do you always get assigned as the entertainment for fellow New Yorkers?” I asked as I stepped beside him.


“Only when I embarrass them in front of a crowd,” he grinned. “Kind of a ritual now.”


I was hurt by how the evening rolled out. “Great.” I said, nodding. “Love being part of a long-standing Keyhaven tradition.”


“You handled it like a champ though,” He said, side-eyeing me. “I don't know why I said that. Hope I didn't offend you?”


“We're cool,” I shrugged. “As you can see, I love being the center of attention.”


He laughed, “Well, you should be. You looked phenomenal out there.”

I gasped.

He pointed toward the left side of the lawn. “Let me change the subject before you think I'm a creep… This way’s the boat house. Boring unless you’re into dad stuff. Fishing rods and anchor ropes and a weird amount of khaki shorts. And that way—” he turned to our right. “Is the dock.”


“I’m more of a dock person,” I said. 


“Say no more,” he smiled. “To the dock it is.”


We passed under some string lights tangled in a row of birches. In the dim glow, I could actually see his face a little better. Softer features, kind, dark, black eyes. Still annoyingly good hair.


The wooden dock creaked gently under our feet. The lake stretched out like glass, reflecting stars that seemed unnaturally clear. The water lapped at the wood in soft, even strokes.


“So,” he said, sitting down and dangling his feet over the edge. “You gonna tell me what brings you here?”


I sat beside him, my shoulders sagged as I looked ahead toward the flickering lights across, some other lakeside jewel. “I’m visiting my aunt because it's the only vacation we could afford,” I said while watching the water. “Apparently one's supposed to have a heartbreak and freckles at these things?”


“True…” He nodded. “Keyhaven summer essentials.”


We both laughed awkwardly.


“So you guys spend the whole summer like this?” I asked.


“You mean socializing?”


I shrugged. “There's socializing and then there's socializing…”


He held his breath for a moment and let it out with a grin. “You hated us!”


I shook my head as I did in debates when I knew exactly what I wanted to say. “Not true… I haven't been here long enough to have such a strong opinion. I'm merely an observer.”


He leaned back, arms stretched on the dock behind his body. “Some of us may be a little on the lavish side but we’re also mostly cool. Academic. Athletic. Filthy rich. Very very privileged.""


I started smiling. “I see… Where do you fall on the privilege scale?”


He got up, his worn out sneakers slapping against the wood. “I'm not on the scale. My grandparents are locals. I just came to visit.”


“You looked like you belonged.”


“What?” He raised his brows. “I grew up with these kids. If you take off your blinders for a second, you'll realize it's not a crime to enjoy life.”


That hurt. I got up with a grunt. “Nice.” 


He let out a breath, almost wistful. We walked back down the gravel path in silence. I actually hated them all now. I hated that most of my friends would not get to go to college and the ones like me would wallow in student debt for the foreseeable future while they would keep serving champagne and shrimp at parties and brag about going to Ivy League Schools.


“Come on,” he said when we reached the fork. One side was the dirt road leading to the cabins lower on the Keyhaven scale. The other one was the gravel leading to Marla's mansionesque house.


“It's almost poker time. The fuckers play with real money.”


“I'm good,” I waved him off. “I'll walk home from here.”


He exhaled and rolled down his shoulders. “You’re looking at me like I'm some kind of an asshole…”


“I'm not…” I showed my palms in surrender. 


“Yeah, you are.” He dawdled toward me. “You are judgmental as hell.”


“Why do you care?” I laughed. “I'm leaving in a few days. Who cares if I think you guys suck?” I pointed toward Marla’s party where the up tempo beats caused a collective hollering among the kids. “They’re calling you…”


He looked like he fought hard not to smile but I saw his teeth anyway.


“Goodnight, Lynn,” he said, giving an exaggerated bow. “You seemed much more interesting in the water…”


“Oh my God!” I hid my face with my palms and stomped away. 


***


I couldn't sleep that night. When I reached the front porch, the cabin felt eerily silent. The room I stayed in overlooked the thick bush that reached the lake. Normally cicadas didn't relent but even they were nowhere to be found.

It was suffocatingly humid that night. The air felt like it was sucked out of the room even when all the windows were wide open.

On top of it, I just couldn't shake the day off my mind. A boy I'd never met before saw me naked. Freaking naked. I felt robbed. Of something. I wasn't sure what aspect of the whole thing was bothering me. All I knew that it was my intellectual property in his head filed up somewhere. 

I had no control how it would be used or whom it would be shared with.

He had already made a spectacle in front of everyone.

Controversially, I also liked that a bit.

How bold he was.

Due to whatever weird process in my brain, whenever I had a naughty thought, I'd sneeze. And it had already made me sneeze three times.

I felt conflicted. 

And of course, utterly ashamed.


The postponed drift to Slumberland dominoed into a later morning. I walked into the kitchen to find my aunt flipping pancakes in a peach shirt dress. Barry Manilow was playing on the radio on the counter and Maeve was sitting on the barstool at the kitchen island, reading.

“Good morning,” I said smiling. “It smells wonderful here…”

“Good morning honey,” my aunt beamed singing along to Copacabana. “Help yourself.”

I sat opposite a very sharky Maeve. Her eyes were following me as I grabbed pancakes from the tray. She pursed her lips and nudged the bowl of strawberries between us toward me. 

“Where were you last night?”  

My eyes darted to my aunt.

“Oh, please.” Maeve shrugged. “She's just taken her Vicodin. You’re fine.”

I peeked at my aunt once more. She seemed so put together.

Her imagine got tainted with the unconsented disclosure. I swallowed not sure how to process it.

 “I was here,” my voice trailed off.

“You're sure about that?” 

Putting on my most serious expression, I said, “Yes. He showed me around and I returned to my room afterwards.”

Her hopeful face dropped a little. “Marla was saying Eli hadn't returned either. Maybe that you guys hit it off.”

“We did not.”

A lie.

I thought we hit it off. At first.

I really judged him out of going back to the party. I hated that I hurt his feelings.

“Okay…” she shrugged. Then another deep stare. “Not even a kiss?”

“Maeve…” I groaned. 

She smiled diabolically. “What was that thing about you skinny dipping? Did he make that up?”

I couldn't help but grin. 

“You sneaky bitch…” She widened her eyes. “Well done!”

My aunt turned off the stove and went to the sink. “What's that honey?” She asked over her shoulder.

I shushed Maeve.

“We're going to take Owen's boat to swim after breakfast,” Maeve said loudly.

“Great idea…” My aunt replied cheerfully.

“Are you really?” I whisper yelled.

“Yes. And you're coming along.”


Maeve got up and went to snuggle up to her mom. She whispered something in her ear and both giggled like sisters.


I saw the eye roll Maeve gave when she walked toward me. It gave me an instant ick. Nothing was safe here. No sincerity in sight.

  

This morning in an oversize hoodie and her signature short shorts she did look like an 8th grader.

“There won't be anyone you haven't met,” She said approaching me. “Owen, Bettany, Jamie, Tom, you and me. Okay?” She put on a honeyed tone. 

“You said no big deal yesterday too.”

“Well,” she rolled her eyes. “I lied. I just really wanted to go to Marla’s party and mom said I couldn't, if you didn’t.”

My head dropped, both offended and impressed. 

I had this strong urge to call my dad and beg him to get me out of here.

I chuckled bitterly.

Maeve put her head on my shoulder and gave me an amateur side hug. “I didn't want you to miss out either.”

Her golden head slowly rose. She walked away itching her belly.

 “We're leaving in twenty minutes!”


***


Before I knew it, I was trudging the footpath past the house with the lavender shutters, heading toward what used to be the town center.


It felt like the town center from yesteryear, back before the rich arrived with their yachts and their curated lakehouse aesthetics. Because every shop and restaurant clung to the pier like barnacles as far as I was concerned, and only the post office and the bus stop were left stranded up here.  


The idea of a bus started to feel more hypothetical the closer I got. The stop itself was basically a plastic bench under a warped plexiglass shelter, with a faded county map and a mosquito safety poster peeling off one side. There wasn’t a timetable in sight. No people around to ask. No sign that public transit had touched this patch of land in years.


Defeated, I sat down. The bench burned the backs of my thighs. I was sweaty and overwhelmed. I didn’t know what I’d do even if a bus did show up.


“Lynn?”


I looked up.


Eli skidded to a stop on his bike, his hair plastered to his forehead, a backpack slung over his shoulders. His mouth opened in confusion.


“What the hell are you doing here?”


I tried to look nonchalant, like it was totally normal to be marinating at a deserted bus stop under the punishing sun.


I shrugged. “Just weighing my options.”


He laughed, hopped off his bike, and let it fall into the grass beside the curb. “Options like what?”


“Like catching the bus to Glennville. Then maybe a Greyhound. Or disappearing into the woods and befriending some raccoons. Depends on if the bus comes, really.”


He sat beside me, elbows resting on his knees. “Are you okay?”


I crumbled. Hot tears welled up, spilled out. I covered my face with my palms, let myself disappear behind them for a moment. Then took a deep breath and tried to scrape myself back together.


Eli leaned back and unzipped his bag. Pulled out a flask.


I took it blindly. Poured the ice-cold water into my hand and splashed it across the back of my neck. Then squeezed a sip into my mouth.


We sat like that for a second. He took the flask gently from my hand and shoved it back into his bag.


“I was going to the cove,” he said. “Want a ride?”


I stared at his rusty bike. Then peeked up at him.


“On that?”


“Yeah,” he said, without hesitation. “Come on. I don’t want you to fry your brain out here.”


I hesitated only a second longer before standing. “Okay,” I muttered, wiping my face with my hand. He steadied the bike and held out his arm. I climbed on the back pegs like I’d done as a kid, clinging to his backpack straps. We wobbled for a few seconds until he found his rhythm, coasting downhill toward the cove.


The wind hit my face in delicious, cooling gusts, and for a moment, it felt like I was moving fast enough to leave my mood behind.


We didn’t talk during the ride. I could hear the crunch of gravel, the rubber against asphalt, and the faint rustling of the trees above. My sneakers brushed against goldenrod and dried weeds as we bumped down the narrow path behind the cabins.


Eli stopped under a shade overlooking the reeds. About fifty yards away from where I first came. It was a hidden lookout spot almost. Trees bowing low overhead. He dropped the bike gently in the grass and peeled off his backpack, then flopped down on the still green grass. I followed and settled beside him with a soft grunt.


Neither of us spoke for a minute. The silence felt safe despite how we left each other the night before. I trusted him inexplicably.    


Without looking at me, he asked, “You really would’ve left?”


“I don’t know. Maybe.” I paused for a breath. “I wasn’t really thinking it through. I guess I just needed to disappear for a while.”


He nodded to himself. “Well, this is my hideout. I come here almost every day.” He turned to me with a sliver of a smile. “To think, to write. Mostly to avoid my family.”


“Why?”


His gaze darted ahead to the reeds. He shook his head. “I've been feeling like an imposter for a while. This last year… It felt like everyone was on fire. They got into their dream schools… One signed with a label. One went to Europe…” He peered at me over his shoulder. “I was under this immense pressure to make something of myself and I couldn't. I felt subpar. I don't know. Fake.”

He averted his eyes again and started plucking the unfortunate grass. “And you rubbed salt in the wound I guess.”


“I'm sorry,” I admitted. “I didn't want to judge you so hard. I just—”


“I get it.”


“I don't know you or these people. I'm sorry for being such a dickhead. Maybe I was jealous of you. You know?”


“I know… Don’t worry.”


“So you didn't apply to any schools?”


“Nah. I’m taking a gap year. Gonna try composing full-time. Maybe teach piano to save money. I wanna get into Julliard like my grandpa.”


“Of course.” I rolled my eyes.  


“Bet you didn't expect that plot twist?” He asked, grinning.


“No.” I shook my head vehemently, suppressing a grin.


“What about you?” He nudged me with his shoulder.


“I still have a year but yeah… The aim is med school. And no, we're not talking Harvard here. Stony Brook, if I'm lucky.”


“Ugh.” He rolled his eyes even harder and pressed a hand to his chest. “Lynn… We're doomed. Even if we live in the same city, we'll never make it…”


I swatted his arm, laughing.


He pretended to keep on but he sounded serious when he added, “We're just so different.”


“Big time.”

What I didn't tell him though was that at that moment, sitting side by side on a patch of grass, it didn't feel like we were.

We fell into silence. I watched him watch the lake for a moment. His eyes were so dark, they shone like marbles as he stared ahead at a skittering bird.

“A sandpiper,” he said softly. “I was watching one when you walked into the frame the other day. It moves like staccato beats.” He turned to me, eyes bright. “You moved the same way. In short, quick notes. You were nervous but excited, like a melody that skips and catches its breath. The water was cold, right? You were shaking, but you took off your clothes like a quick crescendo not to chicken out. Fast, full of energy. And then when you dove in, you slowed down and drifted. That's legato. Smooth and steady.”

I sneezed. Loud enough to send the sandpiper flapping off in a panic.

“Sorry…” I muttered, feeling my cheeks heat.

He smiled gently. “Don’t be. It was the first time in months I’ve written something.”

***


Walking back home from the cove with Eli trailing behind, pushing his bike, I realized if I didn't leave soon, I'd get that heartbreak dad was talking about. 


We stood by the fence, awkward and breathless from walking up the hill. An invisible string tied between our chests, we moved uncomfortably from one foot to the other, neither of us able to just say goodbye and go.


Suddenly remembering something, he raised his right index finger and then propped the bike against a tree. He rummaged through his backpack, a notebook, clinking pens and pencils, lots of loose paper, the flask he shared with me… He took out the notebook and a pen, scribbled phone numbers, an address and an email address. I flushed. Finally, I was privy to something of his too. Something special and important. He tore the page, and when he extended it to me I saw how pink his cheeks were. We stared at each other for a breath and grinned like idiots.

I took the page. Then I took the notebook and the pen. I wrote my details. I gave them back with utmost seriousness. We were bound by an agreement now. And agreement on what, I didn't care. 

He felt like mine.

“I wrote both my home number and my grandparents’,” he said. “Don’t go without saying goodbye.”

“I won’t.”

He mounted his bike extra slowly like he was expecting me to say something. 

“Goodbye Eli,” I said shyly. “I'll see you before I go?”

I made up a game in my head that if he'd say yes, it would mean that I was right, he was mine by contract.

His face lit up. He pushed the pedal. “I'll definitely see you later, Lynn.”


***


I walked through the screen door and found my aunt was sitting by herself on the porch. She had a content expression on her face, sipping her tea languidly, a Danielle Steel book on the coffee table next to her. I went and dragged the large wicker chair opposite her to grab her attention. She was startled by the audacity, momentarily.

“Lynn,” she said, shaking her head. “I thought you'd gone out with Maeve.”

“No… I was at the cove. Thinking.” The words got stuck in my throat. A bird was loudly chirping on the colossal pine to my left as if to stop me from leaving. 

“First of all…” I started like a telemarketer. “I'd like to thank you for opening your home to me. And it is absolutely stunning here—”

“But you wanna go home.”

I leaned back and let the wicker envelope my tired body with its skeleton. I felt small.

“Yes and—”

“I thought you'd enjoy it here,” she said and took a slow sip from her tea. “If it weren't for a couple of old friends, I don't think I could bear it here either… It's like nature heightens your sense of loneliness…”

She finally looked at me, wistful and fragile. “You're a lonely child…” A shrug of her shoulder snapped her out of vulnerability. “At least Maeve has her own thing going…”

“She is…” 


She was more consoling her miserable self than me. I had dozens of questions for her such as why her husband wasn't ever around anymore, but in New York, you were taught to mind your own business with terrible life lessons so I shoved the questions back into the gutter where they belonged.


“I'll take you to Glenville on Thursday morning if that’s what you want,"" she said after a while. 

That was the day after tomorrow. I smiled sheepishly. But it wasn't enough to convey the relief I'd just experienced. I got up and kissed her on the cheek.

She held me amateurishly for a moment with a soft hum. “Okay…” she patted my hand and quickly made an excuse to go inside.


I missed mom.


Maeve came home around six, right as I was fixing myself a late lunch/early dinner combo from whatever was in the fridge.


Her hair was tied on the top of her head. Her face was sunburnt and she was in an unprecedented sour mood. She still had her long sleeved surfer shirt on. She looked like she abandoned the boat before it even approached the pier, soaking wet and undone. She didn't talk to me when she stormed inside. I heard her feet thumping about the cabin and she left in about an hour, completely polished, just as determined as she'd come. 

“See you later Lynn,” she called out from the door.  


I didn't agree with my aunt saying nature heightened the sense of loneliness, you were lonely or not by choice. I chose to sit by myself on the porch and felt much better than I felt with any superficial connection. My aunt possibly chose some pleasures of life and traded for her sanity. 

It depended on what you valued more, really. ",1,1754832695.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Growing up, optimising space or interior design was never a consideration. Priorities were rent, bills, and just the basics needed to make the place work.

Then, I’ve spent many years housesharing, and it shaped how I approach interiors... by not thinking about it! Towards the end, after my housemate left I knew I was going to go travel soon-ish, I kept the flat as it was, with furniture collected over the years. Again, functional with no cohesiveness or style.

Now, at 40, I finally get to create and decorate my own space, I'm SUPER EXCITED but it's tougher than expected. The flat is empty and I'm starting with the living room.

I got the Ikea [friheten](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/friheten-corner-sofa-bed-with-storage-skiftebo-dark-grey-s09133543/) couch so I have a place to sleep for now and can have a decent 'bed' for guests- I'm planning on getting a cover to change its vibe. 

**My questions are**: 

* Where should I put the couch, carpet, and coffee table? My instinct is to place them at the end of the room, facing the window but maybe something else would be better. 
* Any tips to think of the entire space?

1mminpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1mminpx/explore_if_the_best_flat_iron_for_curly_hair_is/,Explore if the best flat iron for curly hair is Hot Tools HT7123BG,"Using the Hot Tools HT7123BG flat iron for styling my hair has been a bit of a revelation. I had to see if it truly lived up to all the hype from the reviews and, honestly, it didn’t disappoint. Styling tools and I go way back, and finding one that delivers sleek results without frying my strands is always a mission. This flat iron, however, might just earn a permanent spot in my daily routine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the Hot Tools HT7123BG feels like a premium product. Its sleek black and gold design isn’t just aesthetically pleasing, but it also feels sturdy and durable. The ceramic, titanium plates with their Micro-Shine finish are incredibly smooth to the touch, and they glide effortlessly through hair without tugging. Even the soft-touch exterior is a thoughtful addition—it feels professional but doesn’t get overly warm during use, which is a much-appreciated detail during lengthy styling sessions.

**Performance and Heat Settings**  
This flat iron heats up rapidly, probably faster than my morning coffee brews. I’ve tested it on varying temperature levels (it goes up to 455°F), and the LED display makes it easy to adjust to just the right heat for my hair type. My thicker, somewhat wavy hair requires higher heat for effective straightening, and this tool delivered without needing multiple passes. Plus, the audible tone notifying when it’s ready is such an underrated feature—you can multitask without staring at the iron, waiting for it to heat up!  

[Find the best price for Hot Tools HT7123BG on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b07ksqz4mr/)

**Versatility: Straighten, Curl, and Everything in Between**  
What genuinely stood out to me was how versatile this tool is. I initially bought it primarily for straightening but was curious to test its curling abilities. Thanks to the rounded edges of the plates, pulling off loose curls and beachy waves was surprisingly easy, even for someone like me who usually struggles to curl hair using a flat iron. The ion generator, responsible for shiny, smooth results, felt like the cherry on top—not just a marketing gimmick but something you can actually see in the finished style.

**User Experience and Usability**  
Hot Tools has clearly considered user convenience. The flat iron has a long swivel cord, which spares you the frustration of tangled wires when moving around, and it’s dual voltage, making it an ideal travel companion. During a recent trip, I used it overseas with only a standard travel adapter, and it worked like a charm. Additionally, the two-hour auto shut-off gives a bit of peace of mind for those (like me) who sometimes leave appliances plugged in when rushing out the door.

**Winning Points**  
- Effortless straightening and curling with consistent results  
- Smooth ceramic and titanium plates with a friction-less glide  
- Rapid heating with an easy-to-read LED display  
- Swivel cord and dual voltage perfect for travel  
- Rounded edges allow for more styling options  

**Areas of Improvement**  
Although I grew to appreciate most features of this flat iron, there are minor aspects that could be rethought:  
- The exterior near the plates gets quite warm during extended use, although not dangerously so. If you’re not super careful when gripping near the edge, it might surprise you.  
- While the included heat-resistant glove is helpful, I didn’t find it particularly comfortable—perhaps totally a personal gripe, but worth mentioning.  
- For those unused to high heat levels, the topmost setting of 455°F may feel excessive, especially for finer hair types.  

**Competing Products**  
I’ve tried comparable straighteners like the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium flat iron and GHD Gold, and while they have their merits, Hot Tools offers a competitive edge in terms of price performance. Babyliss is a trusted name for durability and power, but Hot Tools matches up surprisingly well with its own titanium and ceramic combination. As for GHD, it tends to stick to more mid-range heat levels and focuses on ease of use, whereas this flat iron has more customizable temperature settings. For me, the bang-for-the-buck factor where Hot Tools delivers sleek, salon-worthy results is hard to ignore.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This flat iron balances premium features with a cost-effective price range. While some pricier competitors offer similar results, they don’t exactly outperform this tool, especially for casual users or even professionals seeking reliability without overspending. Then there’s the automatic shut-off and dual voltage combo, components that feel like bonuses at this price point.

1mmin7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthylivingbasics/comments/1mmin7t/finally_found_a_breakfast_that_keeps_me_full/,Finally found a breakfast that keeps me full until lunch - Veggie Scrambled Eggs with a twist,"I've been struggling with breakfast for years. Coffee and whatever I could grab was my norm, which meant I was starving by 10 AM and making questionable snack choices.

After some experimentation, I landed on this veggie scrambled eggs recipe that's been a complete game-changer. The key insight that made all the difference was cooking the vegetables first to build flavor, rather than just throwing everything together.

[Veggie Scrambled Eggs Recipe](https://preview.redd.it/3z180vjsy6if1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a91179c3c3ece63c1a8cf5c743e52eba5c774836)

**The Method:**

Begin with mushrooms, as they require time to release their moisture and develop a deep, savory umami flavor that enhances the dish's complexity. Then add bell peppers (any color works) for sweetness and crunch. Finally, wilt in spinach, which adds iron and folate without overpowering the dish.

The eggs themselves are simple - whisk with a bit of salt and pepper, pour over the vegetables, and scramble on medium-low heat. The patience with temperature is crucial. High heat will make rubbery eggs that nobody wants to eat.

**Nutrition breakdown per serving:**

\~18g complete protein from the eggs

Full serving of vegetables (spinach is loaded with folate, bell peppers have more vitamin C than oranges)

Healthy fats from olive oil

About 250 calories total

Why it works for me:

The protein and fiber combo keeps me satisfied for hours

Takes less than 10 minutes start to finish

Costs about $2.75 per serving

I can prep vegetables ahead of time

1mmin09,https://i.redd.it/ncbk7t2e27if1.jpeg,"Hey! 33F, diagnosed at 17. Still struggling","Hey! I’ve been lurking on this page, taking note and I’m hoping I’ll get some clarity on things… 
Context: I’m 33F and was diagnosed with T1D at 17/18. Only the last few years have I come to grips, acceptance and controlling my levels. 
From first being diagnosed till 2022 I was put on 46 units of lanctus (22 in am, 24 pm) and humalog (up to 8 units per meal). I was suffering from constant daily highs reaching 28/30mmol/L. I now take 6 units of Toujeo (long lasting) in the morning, and only use humalog to correct. The issue is after breakfast my sugars will rise and then after correcting (1unit humalog/ -5mmol/L) they will drop quite rapidly. This happens every morning and I’m struggling to maintain it. I have the same breakfast (porridge and berries with water and almond milk) and a coffee (no sugar, almond milk). My pancreas still produces ‘some’ insulin which I think is why I can live off no humalog, but I don’t know if not knowing exactly how much to inject is draining me and causing this.
I’ve had diabulimia pretty much since my diagnosis, but my relationship with food and insulin is the best it has been. I have been diagnosed with more T1D related problems in the last year which is why I think I’m stressing a little more. 
I just would like to know if anyone else recognises any patterns, dealt with the same problems and how people manage to control levels throughout the day. I see a diabetic nurse often but I guess I would like to hear and take advice from people who know exactly what this feels like, and how best you find to control.
I’m happy to go in to more detail if I’ve missed anything. 
Is this normal for a T1D, to go from so much to so little insulin? 
Could there be something I’m missing or doing wrong?

I met a guy at work and yesterday was my third time hanging out with him, we went out for dinner, he got the drinks as it was a bar/resturant, then we grabbed take away coffee on the way back to his house, I had noticed when grabbing my coffee cup from the car that the lid was off. 
A couple of hours later at his home on the couch, I began feeling really unusual like my state had been altered, i felt like i was on drugs (i dont drink or do any substances) I tasted chemical on my lips when I came into contact with him and so I put two and two together and asked him if he'd taken anything, I even asked if he'd slipped something into my coffee because I honestly didn't know what to think by this point. The whole situation was really strange, we were just sitting on his couch for houre and all i was experiencing was my mind and body slowly becoming more and more altered, yet he wasnt responding with any empathy, he was really quiet with me & i think i even said once or twice ""gosh i think ive been drugged"" he then became really defensive, he became really cold and agitated, he took his phone and walked away, saying he was going to call the police and began making a report that ""there's someone in his property saying they've been drugged"". I told him I think i need an ambulance as my body started to feel really heavy like I was paralysed and I was basically falling in and out of sleep. He hung up from the police and we drove to the ED by this time I was feeling like my body just was not okay, I was 45 minutes from my own suburb and wanted to be closer to home as at this point I just didn't know what to think or do, so he drove to my area in my car and we went to the nearest hospital, the police called him back and he said that he had dropped me off at the ED close to his house, he did not give them my details, im not sure why he lied to them. By 45 minutes into this car ride, I was completely in and out of consciousness, I felt like I was dying, I was dazed, disorientated and had no idea what was going on, he did not say a single word to me the entire time, which made me feel so alone in the experience, we got to ED and I collapsed, I had to be carried in, I was completely non responsive, she kept calling my name but I just couldn't respond or open my eyes, my eyes kept rolling to the back of my head, i could hear everything, i just couldnt respond, but they took my vitals and said it came back all normal, no seizures or possible seizure to occur and i was just left ? 
I don't understand this?  
I didn't feel comfortable with him being there, so I asked him to leave, I stayed at ED falling in and out of sleep & hours later I felt better, able to stand, walk and be coherent, so I left. 
Today I feel like my body has had some type of substance in it, i can't eat, or drink, I cant think straight and I feel pretty yuck. 
I am a big advocate on hospitals and ED, but sometimes it feels like walking into the twighlight zone and I'm so confused as to whether my symptoms were serious or not, I mean, I was okay in the end.

We moved to Oslo last year with my husband's job and must return to the US next year. We're desperate to come back and I want to revector from librarianship to something that will give us a better shot at a job offer with a skilled worker visa.

If you were to choose a career specifically to be able to get a job offer from outside the EU, what would you suggest? I'll have about 5 years to make it happen and can pay for schooling, but I'd like to not start from scratch if I don't have to. My top priority is likelihood of getting a skilled worker visa.

I recognize that the absolute most critical skill is to have excellent Norwegian and I'm treating that as my highest priority. (We didn't get norskkurs as part of our move.) Our daughter (4) attends barnehage and is now fluent. My son was born here and is about to start barnehage as well. (I'm a little behind on my Norwegian - probably B2 reading/writing B1 speaking/listening. Ammetåka is so real.)

I've looked into which career fields are underemployed in Norway, but many of them seem either very niche, or not as stable as they sound (for example, everyone always says ""Learn to code,"" but tech has seen mass layoffs in the last year.) These also don't take into account things like transferring credentials (such as in accounting, which would be easy for me to begin in the US, but it seems that to transfer those skills to Norway I would need another 3 years of school.)

Right now my top contenders are: 
1) Take a 12 month master's program in accounting (MACC), gain work experience in the US, and figure out how to make that applicable to working for a Norwegian company (I'm open to more schooling when we come back)
2) Take law courses in both countries
3) Take additional courses to supplement my information science master's. (My degree specially says Master of Information Science, but my coursework all focused on library and museum work.) I'm looking at something like database architecture or UI/UX
4) If a skilled worker visa fails, come back on a student visa and use that time to network

I'm also undecided about the best thing to do with my remaining year here. My Norwegian isn't good enough to work as a librarian yet. I don't know whether it's better to work at a coffee shop or somewhere until my language skills are up to snuff, or to get them to C1 as fast as possible and try to go straight to working in a library. Or maybe I should enroll in university courses taught in Norwegian next to have proof on paper that my Norwegian is up to snuff.

I’ve been back on it and I’ve been really on top of making sure I take it everyday which I struggle with, but I’ve noticed recently that I have no appetite and have been feeling really sluggish and tired(taking 2 hr naps everyday kind of tired) so to solve that I started taking some B12 vitamins since I’ve noticed in the past that B12 really works for me, but I still have no appetite and don’t really enjoy the foods that I really like anymore. The thing is I’m also in the best headspace I’ve ever been in so I know it’s not anything to do with body image and the only thing I can think of is my meds, either that or my still moderate caffeine intake which I know can suppress appetite, but it’s not like I’m drinking coffee all day and I don’t have any appetite, even at dinner time. I feel like I should talk to my psychiatrist about it since I have an appointment coming up anyway, but I just don’t get what could be different now that’s causing this, other than my B12 I’m taking a multivitamin of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D, because I do actually lack those, especially calcium since I can’t drink milk and from what I know none of those can cause lack/loss of appetite.

\
(Worthy Satire) - In a breakthrough for parents who always dreamed of designing their child like a luxury car, a genetics startup has launched a revolutionary service that ranks embryos based on IQ, height, and facial symmetry -- finally merging science with the moral clarity of a used car dealership.\
\
""Our test lets parents pick the embryo most likely to be a tall, good-looking genius,"" said Dr. Gene Pushmore, founder of BetterBabiez Inc. ""We call it eugenics, but with a tech startup font.""\
\
For just $29,999.99 (with Klarna financing available), expectant parents can now swipe left or right on their own fertilized embryos -- discarding the underachievers before they even form a spinal cord.\
\
Critics have expressed concern over the ethical implications, but Pushmore is undeterred. ""Look, we're not playing God -- we're just helping Him out. Maybe giving Him a little UX upgrade.""\
\
The company plans to expand its offerings in 2026 to include rankings for ""humor potential,"" ""TikTok charisma,"" and ""ability to resist gluten."" A loyalty program will reward returning customers with bonus embryos and a free coffee.\
\
Meanwhile, rival companies are already working on in-womb SAT prep, while Meta is reportedly developing the Zuckling, a pre-coded child optimized for metaverse engagement.\
\
When asked what could go wrong, Pushmore laughed. ""Please. What's the worst that could happen--elitist baby cults, genetic caste systems, and a generation that can't cope unless they're 6'2"" and know calculus by age 5?""\
\
Experts warn this is just the beginning. ""Next they'll be ranking grandparents based on inheritance potential,"" one bioethicist noted, weeping into his last shred of optimism.\
\
Worthy Satire is meant purely for comedic purposes—after all, as Proverbs reminds us, “Laughter is good medicine.” But behind every satire is a real story, video, or event. For the unspun version of the headline, be sure to check out the original source.  \

So… I just hit 30 and, honestly, I’m not sure how to feel about it. It’s weird, part of me feels like I should have it all figured out by now, but another part still feels like I’m winging it. Lately it’s been hitting me harder than I thought… nights feel longer, days feel a bit emptier, and I’ve been overthinking way too much.

I’m not looking for anything intense right now, just someone I can actually talk to. No forced small talk, no fake “so how’s the weather?” type stuff. I like conversations that actually go somewhere, random deep dives about life, the universe, dumb theories, that sort of thing. I’d love to find someone patient, calm, and easy to vibe with.

A little about me: I’m pretty laid back, keep myself fit, and try to live healthy without being annoying about it. I’m into football (just watching, I’m no Ronaldo), good coffee, late-night walks, museums, and slow lunches. My music taste is all over the place, some chill ambient stuff, 80s classics, a bit of rap, some techno/trance when the mood hits. I’m 420 friendly, love to cuddle, and I’m a big fan of that slow burn “get to know you” kind of connection.

If we click, I’d love to eventually meet. maybe a walk, a museum, or just chilling over coffee. But for now, I’m fine with keeping things here and seeing where it goes. Physical chemistry matters to me, but so do trust and boundaries. I’m big on consent and respecting each other’s space.

I guess I’m just looking for someone who’s kind, witty, emotionally aware, and actually wants to know the person on the other side of the screen. Someone who can be lighthearted but also handle those 2am “what’s the point of it all” conversations.

If any of that sounds like you, say hi. Worst case, we kill some time together and make the night a bit less boring.

## Key Features Analysis

The best S10e card cases aren't just about aesthetics; they offer a carefully engineered blend of protection, functionality, and style. To understand what sets the top contenders apart, it's crucial to delve into their key features.**Card Capacity and Security:** A critical aspect of any card case is its ability to securely hold and protect your cards. Many cases feature pockets or slots capable of holding 2-4 cards, typically a driver's license, credit card, and some cash. Security mechanisms vary, with some using tight elastic bands, while others employ more sophisticated snap closures or even RFID-blocking materials to prevent electronic theft. The best cases offer a balance of easy access and robust security to prevent cards from falling out or being compromised.

**Materials and Durability:** The materials used in an S10e card case considerably impact its durability and overall feel. Common materials include TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), polycarbonate, leather (both genuine and synthetic), and sometimes combinations of these. TPU offers excellent shock absorption and versatility, while polycarbonate provides a rigid structure for added protection. Leather adds a touch of elegance and can develop a unique patina over time. The lifespan of the case heavily depends on the quality of these materials and the construction methods employed. More durable options withstand daily wear and tear, protecting both your phone and your cards for an extended period.

**Protection Against Drops and Scratches:** A primary function of any phone case is to protect the device from accidental drops and scratches. The best S10e card cases integrate shock-absorbing materials and reinforced corners to mitigate the impact of falls. Raised edges around the screen and camera lens prevent scratches when the phone is placed face down. The level of protection offered can vary significantly, with some cases prioritizing slimness over maximum impact resistance, while others offer more rugged designs for demanding environments.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design and aesthetics of an S10e card case are a matter of personal preference, but the best options seamlessly integrate functionality with style. Cases come in various colors, textures, and patterns to complement individual tastes. Slim profiles are popular for minimizing bulk, while others prefer a more considerable feel for added grip and protection. Features like precise cutouts for ports and buttons ensure easy access and functionality without compromising the overall design.**Accessibility and Ease of Use:** An S10e card case should be easy to use in daily situations. This means easy access to cards, responsive button covers, and seamless charging compatibility. Some cases allow users to quickly access their cards with a simple slide or pull mechanism, while others require more deliberate action. The case should not interfere with wireless charging or the use of headphones or other accessories. The best cases strike a balance between secure storage and effortless accessibility.

**RFID Blocking Technology (Optional):** as digital theft becomes more prevalent, some S10e card cases incorporate RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking technology. This feature adds a layer of security by preventing unauthorized scanning of your credit cards and other RFID-enabled cards. While not essential for everyone, RFID blocking provides peace of mind for those concerned about electronic pickpocketing and data breaches.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right S10e card case transcends mere aesthetics; it's about unlocking a range of practical benefits that streamline your daily routine and enhance your peace of mind.

**Streamlined Minimalism:** The most critically important benefit of an S10e card case is its ability to consolidate your essentials.By combining your phone case and wallet into a single unit, you can eliminate the need to carry a separate wallet, reducing bulk and simplifying your pockets. This is especially beneficial for those who prefer a minimalist lifestyle or find customary wallets cumbersome. Streamlining your everyday carry can lead to a more organized and less cluttered life.

**Enhanced Convenience and Accessibility:** With your cards readily accessible on the back of your phone, you can make quick payments and access IDs without fumbling through a wallet.This convenience is especially valuable when you're on the go, such as navigating public transport, grabbing a coffee, or making a quick purchase. Having your essential cards at your fingertips saves time and reduces frustration.

**Improved Security and Reduced Risk of Loss:** By keeping your cards securely attached to your phone, you reduce the risk of losing them. A well-designed card case holds your cards firmly in place, preventing them from accidentally slipping out. Moreover, having your phone and cards together means you're less likely to leave one behind, minimizing the chances of misplacing your wallet or individual cards.

**Protection for Both phone and cards:** An S10e card case provides dual protection, safeguarding both your phone and your cards from scratches, bumps, and minor impacts. The case absorbs shocks and prevents direct contact with other surfaces, extending the lifespan of your phone and keeping your cards in good condition. This dual-layer protection provides peace of mind and reduces the need for costly repairs or replacements.

**Stylish and Functional Design:** Today's S10e card cases offer a wide range of stylish designs to match your personal preferences. Whether you prefer a sleek and minimalist look or a more rugged and textured design, there's a card case to complement your style. The combination of style and functionality makes these cases a fashionable and practical accessory for your S10e.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of S10e card cases can raise several questions. Here are some answers to common concerns.**Will using a card case damage the magnetic strips on my credit cards?**
While early card cases sometimes had issues with demagnetizing cards, modern designs are generally safe.Many cases now use RFID-blocking materials or strategically placed pockets to minimize the risk of magnetic interference. However,it's always advisable to monitor your cards regularly for any signs of damage,especially if the case uses a strong magnetic closure.

**Do card cases interfere with wireless charging on the S10e?**
Some thicker card cases can interfere with wireless charging,particularly those with bulky card compartments or metallic elements. however, many manufacturers design their cases to be wireless charging compatible. Check the product specifications to ensure compatibility before purchasing, or consider a slimmer case if wireless charging is a priority.

**How many cards can a typical S10e card case hold securely?**
Most S10e card cases are designed to hold 2-4 cards comfortably and securely. Overloading the case can stretch the card slots or pockets, possibly leading to cards falling out. It's generally best to stick to the recommended capacity to ensure proper security and prevent damage to the case.

**Are card cases easy to remove and replace when needed?**
The ease of removing and replacing an S10e card case varies depending on the design and material. TPU cases tend to be more flexible and easier to install and remove compared to rigid polycarbonate cases. Evaluate the case's flexibility and grip to ensure a cozy and hassle-free experience.

She met him on a Tuesday, the kind of day that smelled like old rain and new sin. He wore his trauma like cologne, and she—she inhaled it like gospel. They were two broken clocks trying to tell time to each other, always a minute too late, always a second too soon.

> _“It could all be so simple…”_  
> But they made it hard.

He loved her like a storm loves a coastline—violent, beautiful, and always returning to destroy what it once kissed. She loved him like a prayer whispered in a burning church: desperate, defiant, and doomed.

Their apartment was a shrine to dysfunction. The walls held secrets like bruises. The dishes never got washed, but the arguments did—scrubbed raw until they gleamed with resentment. She’d write poems on sticky notes and leave them on the fridge:

> _“You say you care, but you don’t show it.  
> I say I’m fine, but I don’t mean it.”_

He’d crumple them like receipts from a life he never wanted to pay for.

---

Nights were the worst. That’s when the ghosts came. Not the kind that haunt houses—the kind that haunt hearts. She’d lie beside him, inches away, galaxies apart. His silence was louder than her sobs. And when he did speak, it was in riddles and rage.

> _“No one loves me like you do,”_ he’d say.  
> _“That’s the problem,”_ she’d whisper.

---

They danced on the edge of goodbye for years. Each fight was a rehearsal for the final act. Each kiss, a eulogy. She started to see herself in fragments—in mirrors, in wine glasses, in the way her voice cracked when she said _“I’m tired.”_

He started to disappear in pieces. First his laughter. Then his apologies. Then his presence.

---

The day she left, the sky didn’t cry. It was too exhausted. She packed her memories in boxes labeled _“almost”_ and _“never again.”_ He watched her from the doorway, eyes hollow, mouth full of words he’d never say.

> _“I keep letting you back in…”_  
> But this time, she didn’t return.

---

Now, she writes poems in peace. They don’t rhyme, but they breathe. She drinks coffee without flinching. She sleeps without dreaming of him. And when she hears _Ex-Factor_ on the radio, she doesn’t cry.

She just nods.

1mmie8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/1mmie8i/so_i_got_tired_of_private_servers_ignoring_their/,"So, I got tired of private servers ignoring their communities and built something different...","Hey,

I know what you're thinking - another server post promising revolutionary changes. I get it, we've all been burned before.

Coming from AAA game development, I got fed up with how the professional industry had to design games for everything other than fun and without the player's enjoyment in mind. I have spent many years in the private server scene here and its obvious most private servers repeat the same patterns: developers making unilateral decisions, pay-to-win mechanics slowly creeping in, communities getting ignored. So, I started building something different. *(Yeah, I know I am not the first to say this and every server says this. It's up to you, if you want to give it a try).*

**Community Server Objective:**

Everything gets decided by community vote through Discord. Cross-faction guilds? Players voted yes. Some feature people hate? We vote it out. I just build whatever the community decides on.

Absolutely zero pay-to-win. Look, we have an optional subscription to help keep the lights on, if you feel compelled to help - it does come with a few very minor benefits like instant flight paths and similar stuff. It's more about the support than anything. Before anyone grabs their pitchforks, yes, some might technically call these ""pay-to-win"" but compared to servers selling gear and gold, it's laughably mild. You'd probably argue buying coffee gives you an unfair advantage too. Point is, we're not trying to trick anyone - we wish server costs weren't a thing, but reality is what it is.

**Current community-voted features:**

Account-wide mounts and achievements, cross-faction everything, racial swapping, auto-learn spells, AoE looting that actually works in groups, transmog for all armor types, character services for gold only, plus various class improvements, and so many very subtle touches that make the gameplay flow better.

**A Little About Us:**

I'm calling it ""WoW+"" because we're building upon the entirety of the world and not locking into one expansion and its content. Think of it as exploring what WoW could have become with different design choices. Our focus is not progression, it's after progression. I would like to bring in my version of a few systems I have seen or worked with over the years, if the community has an interest. We are using progression to make sure the platform is running smooth enough so when we start building the plus part out, we will have very stable foundation.

Client: Another WotLK Server *(Bet you weren't expecting that!)*  
Current Phase: 1 *(10m Naxx cleared x3)*

Server's stable, bugs are minimal, and the Discord is actually enjoyable to hang out in. Most people join expecting disappointment but end up sticking around.

The name ""The Best WoW Private Server"" sounds arrogant, I know. It's meant to be tongue-in-cheek and satirical while also representing the standard we're aiming for.

If retails burned you out or you're tired of servers that overpromise and underdeliver, feel free to check us out: [thebestwowprivateserver.com](http://thebestwowprivateserver.com)

No pressure though. I'm building this because I genuinely love WoW and want to share that passion with others who feel the same.",0,1754831980.0,wowservers,4,0.41,False

1mmidl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mmidl3/what_makes_the_sumex_charcoal_water_filter/,What makes the Sumex charcoal water filter perfect for Cuisinart coffee makers? Review,"Daily coffee brewing becomes a small luxurious routine with the SUMEX B085VS1R12 12-Pack of Cuisinart Compatible Replacement Charcoal Water Filters for Coffee Makers. Over the past month, these filters have joined my kitchen arsenal, and I’ve tested them thoroughly in my Cuisinart machine. With coffee as an essential part of my day, ensuring the water I use is clean and filtered is non-negotiable. These filters aim to transform basic tap water into the perfect brewing medium while improving overall beverage flavors. Let me dive into what stood out about this pack, its features, and some aspects where I feel improvements could be made based on my personal experience.

**Design and Compatibility**  
Who knew water filters could be this hassle-free? The design of these charcoal water filters surprised me with their simplicity. Advertised as compatible with *all* Cuisinart coffee makers, I was skeptical at first. However, the installation process was genuinely straightforward. From my older 12-cup brew machine to my coworker’s sleek single-serve model, we tested compatibility across various devices. The fit was seamless every time, which means these filters truly deliver on the promise of universal compatibility. Plus, the ultra-fine micromesh material keeps charcoal particles from sneaking into the brew cycle, giving me one less thing to worry about.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Universal fit across all Cuisinart coffee makers, so there’s no need to second-guess.  
- The micromesh material ensured no charcoal residue, making my coffee-machine maintenance even easier.  
- Ultra fine-grain activated charcoal actually improved water clarity and removed noticeable chlorine odors from my tap water.  
- Each filter comes in a convenient compact size, fitting snugly without additional adjustments.  

[Ready to snag SUMEX B085VS1R12? See Amazon’s price.](https://usedwater.com/price/b085vs1r12/)

**Enhanced Coffee Flavor**  
If you’ve ever brewed coffee with unfiltered water, you know how some odd aftertastes can totally ruin it. Using these filters brought the shift I didn’t realize I needed. The activated charcoal element eliminates not just chlorine but also calcium deposits and any impurities that could alter the aroma or taste of the coffee. I hadn’t entirely believed the claims of “improved flavor” until my parents, regular instant coffee drinkers, noted the change during breakfast. They genuinely asked if I’d switched coffee brands that day.

**Durability and Longevity**  
For someone who drinks too much coffee—I mean it, *a lot* of coffee—a filter that lasts is crucial. Each filter is marketed to last 30 days, which felt accurate with my usage. Over 3-4 weeks of daily brewing for myself and occasional guests, these filters managed to retain their effectiveness. I’ve learned some folks stretch them longer, but I like sticking to their recommendation for consistent results.

**Downsides**  
- The filters aren’t reusable (understandably so), but the environmentalist in me wishes there were a green-friendly option for disposal.  
- While these filters are great, they don’t entirely eliminate water hardness like more advanced water-softening systems would.  

**Ease of Replacement**  
If replacing filters feels overly complicated, I’m out—that’s a dealbreaker. Thankfully, SUMEX nailed this aspect. Swapping out old filters for new ones is a breeze. No tools, no instruction booklet needed. Merely pop the filter into the designated slot, and I was back to brewing coffee within minutes.

**Product Competitors**  
Other brands like GoldTone or K&J offer similar replacement charcoal water filters. Where SUMEX excels is its universal compatibility and ultra-fine charcoal grain. GoldTone had filters that occasionally clogged during testing, and K&J felt bulkier, making installation a bit awkward in smaller machines. On the other hand, competitors like AmazonBasics offer budget-friendly options, although these didn’t filter odors as effectively as the SUMEX filters in my side-by-side trial.

**True Value**  
When compared to similar water-filtering systems for coffee makers, there’s a solid balance in terms of cost and performance here. While you might find cheaper options elsewhere, the quality difference becomes apparent in taste and ease of use. With 12 filters in a single pack, I’m basically set for a good portion of the year. For anyone who takes coffee seriously, this extension of your brewing ritual genuinely feels worth it. In fact, even for occasional coffee drinkers, maintaining clean water is critical, and these filters make it ridiculously easy to achieve just that.

**Document Requirements:** Based on my experience last year, these were the required documents. Please verify if there have been any changes for the current year.

Original documents plus 2-3 photocopies of each:

* 10th Standard Marks Card
* 12th Standard (PUC) Marks Card
* Study Certificates
* Photocopy of your Aadhaar card and your parents' Aadhaar cards
* Passport-sized photographs

You can either get the photocopies attested by a gazetted officer or self-attest them.

* For those who paid ₹750, the additional fee was ₹48,000.

If you happen to meet someone from your branch during the admission process, there is a high probability they will be your classmate.

**Hostel and mess:**

**For Boys:** You will have two hostel options:

1. One on campus.
2. One located approximately 1.5-2 km away.

Both have the same fee structure, but the on-campus hostel's infrastructure is considered below average.

1mmici6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexlessmarriage/comments/1mmici6/there_is_hope/,There is hope!,"I (30M) have been following this for a few years on multiple throwaways. My gf (30F) and I have been together for nearly 10 years. I would have proposed years ago but we have had multiple family deaths, suicides etc that has made that push out. Then started the SSRIs and heavy weed smoking to “deal” with it all. Worst thing we could have done, anyway that’s another post for another group probs. We then went through the dead bedrooms and it felt like we were roommates. 

Well this post is a positive post and I am not trying to flaunt it or throw it in anyone’s face but it is just to bring some positivity and hope for everyone who needs it. I know the feeling big time. After alot of thinking and unfortunately how a lot of the posts go in this group I considered us breaking up. I thought for a last ditch effort as I am madly in-love with this girl and she is the love of my life that I would try to fix things once and for all. 

Everything I read into had the same ideas with the same end result of no improvement which is along the lines of the definition of stupid (same approach with the same result thinking it will be different). Talk, vent etc etc. This time I thought what can I do differently and instead of blaming my partner I blamed me. I looked from my partners perspective and thought would I want to sleep with me. It was a rude awakening. I would work all day, come home exhausted and do the bare minimum around the house, then cook dinner if it was my turn and retreat to my PlayStation or mancave to destress. I figured this was making me only stress more and think about the DB and everything else that was wrong in my life. The cycle would continue day to day and I would get more and more frustrated. After this awakening I had a new approach. It was simple to me actions speak louder than words… so I did the below. 

- Started walking with my partner after work every day and discussed all the shit things in the open and none was to be discussed in the home our new happy place.
- Surprised my love with breakfasts in bed (twice a week), coffee with a little love note under it and a big morning cuddle (daily). 
- Stopped PlayStation and limited it to a few hours a week. Instead I would ask my partner what she wanted to do or what shows we could both agree on and watch together. We also cut out the serial killer docos as I didn’t realise what a mood killer they were but like derrr. ‘Shameless’ was a great change with the humour but also multiple sex scenes per episode would really get us going.
- Didn’t just do the bare minimum of chores to get by but also thought hey we aren’t living in the 60s anymore. With the cost of living and the politicians and billionaires fucking up the world both partners now need to work so why should mine be doing majority of the house work and who did I think I was not to share it 50/50. I don’t wait for her to ask I think what needs to be done and get on with it. Also work is easier than being a stay at home parent. Don’t ever think differently. It’s exhausting and is wayyyyyy longer hours. 
- We both cook dinner together most nights and we love it. Unless one is exhausted or has to work late we don’t argue it’s just commonsense to get on with it. 
-Eat dinner together at the table with no distractions, no phones or tv and just discuss our day. No talking about others or the worlds problems just pick an interesting intellectual topic and discuss it in depth. Trivial Pursuit cards have the topics covered if needed.
- I started actually listening to her problems and instead of giving solutions I would stop and say do you want cuddles or solutions and go with whatever was needed. Fellas we don’t have all the solutions. Sometimes we just need to listen and then love. 
- I dropped the porn and masturbation daily as it was just adding to an empty void prior and not satisfying me. I’d say I was a sex addict.
- I deleted my social media apps and would only look once a week and now I just couldn’t care at all about someone else’s fake life. Also my feed was full of half naked sexual girls thinking that’s what I should expect from mine. 
- A few nights a week both shower and get ready for bed together and then she would give me a back massage and I would give her a bum massage (if you haven’t had one of tried it thank me later) 
- SPOONING… don’t expect sex from it every time but wow does it seem to get her going. If we weren’t fucking that night we were the next or within a few days. 
- Board games… the laughter and banter we got out of this made us feel like kids again in the honeymoon phase. Instead of doom scrolling depressing shit or reading some bs AI generated caption or free mongering fake video.
- Dropped all sexual expectations. Let it come naturally and wow do we cum now. Online surveys about how often couples have sex are bullshit. Some weeks or months you may be rabbits and others tortoises. 
- Dropped the resentment. This was making me moody all the time and not a nice person to be around. Further cock blocking me. 
- Exercise!! It doesn’t need to be vigorous but we started doing yoga together. Also a side bonus getting to see her sexy self and camel toe in that active wear. Now it seems that yoga seems to turn into naked yoga and stretching other muscles. Not all the time and only a few but hey that’s new. 
- Take care of ourselves. Not sexually but do the simple shit. Drink water, eat healthy, cut the alcohol to dinner parties or events only. Also no weed or drugs except the occasional doobie on a holiday or weekend away at the beach. Keep fit. 
- Now this one I have been told about for so long and thought yeah whatever but journaling is a game changer. Don’t trauma dump all your shit on your partner. Obviously have good communication about the things that need discussion but if you had a bad day take a moment before you go home and journal. You don’t have to write it down you can record yourself while driving then play it back to yourself and delete it. If you do write it down then read it over and delete it. Go in depth and take all your frustration out then listen or read, process and then forget. Life’s too short to hold onto this stuff.
- Communicate positively. Drop the negatives. Be positive. 
- Compliments!! Take notice of them. The little things matter and mean the most. Not when they are dressed up but at their most vulnerable. 

Really all that changed was instead of coexisting I put in the effort that my partner desired and deserved and let my actions speak louder than words. I’m at the point now where I was just joking today saying “sheeeit why did I ever complain now my dick is about to fall off”. I hadn’t had head in 3 years. Now it’s like the song colt 45 and she really “sucks that dick till the shit turned white”. It may not be the same for all of you here (sorry to the ones who do most in a household and aren’t being satisfied) but going back to the basic things in life, those little moments that when the end comes really are the big moments in life can be the difference. It’s corny AF but live, love, laugh! Don’t just exist, love the person that you love and don’t just tell them fucking show them! Don’t just blame them as it takes two to tango. 

A saying I have also started to live by that has changed my love life and everyday life, career, friendships etc for the better in every way is…
Good, Better, Best. Never let is rest. Until good is better and better is best! 

I hope this can help some of you. I have really been through it and maybe not for as long as some but after playing the blame game and turning the endless talks which lead to arguments into actions on my own part and a hard look at myself it changed everything. Although this group has helped me alot and I wish you all the best I am proud to say that I will be deleting my throwaways and most likely reddit in general. 

I sincerely do wish every single one of you all the best and as mentioned hope that this can help a few of you. There is hope and sometimes we need to turn the spotlight onto ourselves. Remember that everyone is different. Different things work for different situations. You are a smart cookie and if you can be honest with yourself and not just blame the other you will figure it out. In saying this too some situations may be that the love and desire has gone but you can either work to change that and if not then find what you deserve in your life. 

Much love to you all and thank you ❤️

Think of this subreddit as a quiet café tucked away in a busy city—no loud music, no pressure to mingle, no judgment if you just sit in the corner and observe.

This is a space for Filipino introverts to share stories, thoughts, and experiences without the noise and rush of everyday life. Whether you want to join the conversation or simply read along, you belong here.

There’s a unique rhythm to being an introvert in the Philippines. It’s the comfort of sitting quietly in a coffee shop while jeepneys rumble outside. It’s the joy of reading in your room while the rest of the household is caught up in karaoke night.

There’s peace in the small things: The slow drip of coffee in the morning. The soft light of a desk lamp at night. The way conversations feel deeper when they happen one-on-one.

But there’s also the other side—the weight of social expectations in a culture where pakikisama and “loud togetherness” are almost a rule. The pressure to join every group lunch. The teasing when you choose silence over small talk. The guilt of declining an invitation even when your social battery is running on empty.

Sometimes it feels like you live in two worlds: One where you blend in, smile, and nod along. And one where you retreat, breathe, and finally feel like yourself.

Here, we can live in that second world together—no explanations needed.

If you’re reading this, I’d love to hear from you:  
**What’s one joy and one struggle you’ve felt as an introvert living in the Philippines?**

You can answer… or just stay quietly in the corner.

On my 4th treatment for cdiff… I am currently on the taper dose of dificid — take on pill every other day for 20 days. Yesterday I had my first soft blob poop since September of 2024.  After that it was back to mushy. But the urgency is so much better. I can eat and not have to run. I can drink coffee and not die. But like why did the poop change? I got super excited.

1mmi8uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mmi8uv/explore_the_ougar8_refrigerator_door_handle/,Explore the OUGAR8 Refrigerator Door Handle Covers review for ultimate kitchen cleanliness!,"The OUGAR8 Refrigerator Door Handle Covers (B088QT3P3T) are one of those clever little items you didn't know you needed until you've used them. As someone constantly battling smudged and sticky refrigerator handles, especially with a couple of curious kids who seem to view household appliances as their personal canvas, these covers arrived like a solution to a problem I didn’t realize could be fixed so easily.

**Design and Material**  
These handle covers come in a stylish gray color and are made of linen, which felt incredibly soft right out of the packaging. The matte finish gives them a modern and subtle aesthetic, blending seamlessly into the look of my stainless steel fridge. Their length—15.74 inches on the longer covers and 6 inches on the shorter one—is practical. They easily adapt to different appliance handles, from refrigerators to ovens to dishwashers. The Velcro fastening design is as simple as it is effective, making installation effortless. I was surprised by how securely they stayed put; they held their position without slipping down even when opened and closed repeatedly.  

**Ease of Use**  
The Velcro system deserves an appreciation of its own. It’s adjustable and ensures these covers can fit a wide range of handle sizes. I slapped one on my microwave handle, another on my oven door, and even experimented with a kitchen cabinet just to test versatility. Adjusting them for a firmer fit wasn’t an issue either. They felt sturdy yet didn’t leave behind any weird marks or impressions when removed.  

**[Find the best price for OUGAR8 Refrigerator Door Handle Covers, B088QT3P3T, on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b088qt3p3t/)**  

**Performance and Practicality**  
Functionality is where these covers shine. They do a great job of keeping handles free from greasy fingerprints, smudges, and accidental food stains. In my kitchen, they were an immediate hit for two reasons. First, they kept toddler stains in check, and second, they protected the integrity of an otherwise pristine appliance. Cleaning them is easy as well since they’re machine washable. I just had to Velcro them together before tossing them into the washer, and they came out perfectly intact with no fraying.  

The double-sided nature of the covers is another nifty feature. When one side starts to show signs of wear, flipping it over extends their lifespan significantly. Little touches like this make a big difference in how practical a product feels over daily use.  

**Highlights**  
- Soft yet durable linen material.  
- Velcro design allows easy attachment and removal.  
- Machine washable and low maintenance.  
- Versatile sizing fits various kitchen appliances.  

**Critiques**  
Not everything about these covers is flawless. The biggest downside I noticed is that their gray color isn’t entirely stain-proof. While it hides smudges well, darker stains like coffee or sauce could stand out unless cleaned immediately. Also, while the material is machine washable, a few reviewers noted that excessive washes might weaken the Velcro over time.  

- Gray color might become stained with spills.  
- Frequent washing could reduce Velcro strength.  

**Competing Products**  
Other alternatives on the market such as Homydom handle covers or Nuovoware appliance gloves have their own unique appeal. For example, Nuovoware covers often come in more color options, which might suit those looking for a pop of personality in their kitchen. Meanwhile, Homydom's microfiber-based covers are ultra-fluffy and particularly excellent for absorption. However, the OUGAR8 covers arguably provide better versatility with their adjustable Velcro system and a balance between aesthetics and functionality.  

Unlike some competitors that slide down or fail to stay secure during frequent use, OUGAR8’s precise Velcro adjustment mechanism offers a tighter fit. However, in terms of washing durability, microfibre options from others may slightly outshine it.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For all its features, the price of these covers feels fair. They bring significant convenience and practicality without breaking the bank. Compared to other options, they hold up well in terms of material quality, customization options, and longevity. Someone on a tight budget might even consider them a steal given how simple yet effective they are in keeping appliance handles pristine. And unlike disposable cleaning solutions, I’ve found these reusable covers save on long-term costs too.

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a note-taking app I built out of personal need.

I often come across bits of text or words online that I want to instantly add to specific notes without the hassle of copy-pasting and switching between apps. That’s what sparked the idea for a **clipboard-to-note** feature, and it eventually grew into a full-fledged app

It’s now on the Play Store, priced at just **€1** (one-time purchase). No subscriptions, no ads. I focused on keeping it lightweight, functional, and a cute UI in my opinion 😊

**Features:**

* **Essential note & checklist support** – Create, edit, and customize notes
* **Custom colors and labels** – To organize notes 
* **Search functionality** – Quickly find a piece of text stored in your notes
* **Unique clipboard integration** – Instantly append selected text to a note from anywhere 👈
* **Biometric lock** – Use your phone’s fingerprint to secure access.
* **Optional Google Drive sync** – For backups.

Despite being on the Play Store for a while, the app hasn’t gained much traction 😔

If it’s not something you’d personally use, that’s totally okay. But, I’d still really appreciate any feedback or thoughts.

Does the feature set feel complete and useful?

Is the €1 one-time price fair?

Any tips on where I could promote or share this more effectively?

Thank you for your time! Any honest feedback means a lot to me. Please be kind 😊

Nobody else seems to hear it and the sound gets so loud that I have to cover my ears, despite it being in my head, and squeeze my eyes shut for about 15 minutes before it subsides enough to move around again.

A bit of background to try to narrow this problem down. I'm a 6ft 220lbs male who has PMES seizures, chronic migraines, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I'm also currently taking dilvaproex for the seizures.
At my previous job, I was exposed to controlled explosions and gunfire as well as other high decibel noises for extended periods of time.
Now, my job is very lackluster in comparison, I spend roughly 14 hours a night in a very quiet area watching for wildlife.

At the time of the noise, I was standing in my kitchen drinking coffee. There was a few bug noises from outside, but nothing overly loud. Then the noise just hit me and I was nearly doubled over in pain.

Honestly, to sum this post up, I'm trying to identify what could be the cause of the noise and start working on fixing or at least minimizing it.

Let me know what you think. Either way, thanks for your time and patience :) \]\]*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ginger waitress drops a double espresso and my favorite portobello sandwich before I can say a word. “Looked like you were crashing,” she says.  
“Wow,” I tell her, “mind reader.”  
“Only the easy parts.” Wink. Gone.

Alex slides into the booth late. Same sharp eyes from school, now rimmed in what is probably research bag shadows. He’s always been a lab rat. We burn twenty minutes on life. He’s careful with the details: “tests,” “calibration,” “headaches I deserve.” Somewhere between the second and third coffee sip, I admit it’s been too long since I’ve had anything real with someone. He just nods, like he already knew.

I watch him for a moment, this guy buried in his work while I’ve been buried in nothing, and I ask, “Is it worth it?”

His eyes light up: ""Definitely, I can't talk about it, but if it works... if it works..."".

Outside, rain freckles the trunk as he pops it. Black duffel, half‑zipped. Wires. A thin black headband. A palm‑sized brick, green dot pulsing like a throat. I look away.

“Ride?” I ask.

He drives me across town to a house party Gabe roped me into to get me “out of the house.” I’m hoping he shows, because otherwise I’m stuck with strangers. We say we’ll meet again soon, and then Alex gives me a quick look, taps the wheel twice, like he’s agreeing with something I never said, and peels away.

The party is nothing special, maybe I am just getting too old for them. I spot Gabe, then lose him in the crowd almost immediately. Music. Plastic cups. A floor going soft under strangers. I find a wall and lean into it like that was the plan all along. Two minutes from now, I’m gone.

Then her.

Black dress. Bare shoulders catching the light. Stillness that doesn’t belong here. She watches me like a sniper and smiles like she’s already won.

We talk. It’s liquid, easy. She drops a band I haven’t thought about since I was twelve, a place I once swore I’d see. Each one lands like a coin in an old jar. Her eyes are a shade you can’t name in one try, catching mine and holding. She laughs half a beat before I do. My skin feels a size too small.

“You’re quick,” she says, leaning in so the faint scent of something expensive and warm hits me. “But you tidy your thoughts before you let them out.”

“That’s not…” I start, and already want the words back.

“Mmh,” she says, slow enough to feel like a hand tracing my spine.

I should go. I don’t. The black dress shifts when she tilts her head. “It’s quieter at my place.” Her mouth shapes it like an invitation I’ve been waiting on for years. I nod, and it’s as if I’ve been moving toward this moment all along without knowing it.

We cut three blocks. Cold air. Wet mint in a garden. Her door opens on a neat little house, books stacked with intent, a room arranged like a solved puzzle.

We don’t waste time. She moves like she’s a beat ahead of my nervous system. Every reach, every breath, anticipated, mirrored, improved. It feels incredible and wrong, like cheating at a game I didn’t know I was playing.

After, I’m still catching my breath. She slips off the bed, bare feet pale against the dark floor, toes flexing like she’s waking from a dream. “Water?”

""Yeah,"" I say. The room hums, steady, but not all the way smooth.

She’s gone longer than water takes. I’m still buzzing, lazy from the heat of her skin, the whole night vibrating in my head. Staring at the ceiling gets old. A board creaks somewhere past the door. I slide off the bed and wander out.

Halfway down, against the wall, a black duffel slumps like it was dropped mid-stride. Half-zipped. The thin headband inside catches the light. Same kind as Alex’s. My chest tightens, I keep going.

A door ahead hangs ajar. Inside: a man in his forties pacing a strip of rug worn to thread, buzzed hair, eyes on the floor. Fingers flipping a coin… tink, tink, tink.

“Hey,” I whisper.

He flinches. Squeezes his eyes tight. Words tumble out fast: “red cup, fridge magnet, two left shoes, Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday don’t…” He clamps his mouth. Looks at me like I’m a trap.

“You okay?”

He smiles wrong. “Teaspoons,” he whispers. “Think teaspoons. Or license plates. Or bones. She can’t eat noise.”

“What?”

Footsteps. He drops his gaze and starts muttering: radius, mycelium, femur, rhizoid… aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen… May ninth, fifteen. The words don’t connect to anything. Just scraps. His eyes flick up at me, wide, like I should already know why.

She is in the doorway. Phone loose in her hand, face lit furnace‑orange by the screen. She takes us in the way heat does when it finds bare skin.

“Aww,” she says. “Boys’ club.”

The coin stops. His mouth stays open. A slow heaviness spreads inside me.

She looks at me. Not at my face… through it.

“The call,” she says.

“When you were sixteen, and he said he couldn’t do it anymore… and you kept still, praying no one would remember seeing you on the bridge with him. I know, and you know… but would they believe you?""

Everything locks. I can’t breathe, the floor starts moving like the whole house starts tipping me toward her, my head going light.

“Don’t,” I say. Sound like paper tearing.

“I didn’t say a name.” Her thumb rests above SEND. Casual. “You keep your guilt in tidy rooms. It’s cute.”

“I don’t know you.”

“You do now.” She jerks her chin. “Living room.”

We go. She doesn’t touch me. She never has to. She steps into the gap where refusal would form and fills it with compliance. The pacing man follows like a string is tied to the soft part under his ribs.

She sits. I sit.  
The coin man’s muttering stutters. She slides a heavy tumbler across the table toward him without looking. “Drink.”

His hand trembles as he obeys. One swallow, then another. By the third, his knuckles are white around the glass. He shudders, eyes wide, then tips forward. The coin slips from his lap and disappears under the chair.

She doesn’t watch him fall. “They started with good intentions,” she says. “A handful of so-called scientists like your dear friend, Alex. They thought they could fix the human condition, introduce the next stage. No fear, no lies, no loneliness.”

Her phone screen, again, glows against her face while her eyes stay on me.

“They’ve been trying this for years in Russia. Whole towns, work camps, fishing fleets… the white coat idiots always start the same way: grinning like they’ve just fixed humanity. And for a few days, it’s beautiful. Everyone moving together. Thinking together. No hunger, no arguments, no waste.

Then the body starts eating itself.

In the outskirts of Yakutsk, they called it ‘streamlining.’ People who slowed the mind-reading collective were… processed. Their bones baked into winter bread. In Khatanga, dissent was a ‘fault,’ so they removed the minds but kept the bodies walking, empty shells doing whatever the others pushed at them. In Kuzomen, neighbors hacked each other apart with kitchen knives and shed hatchets until the snow was deep red and the town was silent.

Her voice softens, but it’s the softness of a blade sliding back into its sheath.

“I was inside a collective once. At first, it’s intoxicating… the rush of being known completely. Then you realize they’re not just reading you… they’re *inside* you. Rearranging you. Smiling while they move things you thought were sacred. And the worst part?”

She pauses just long enough for my pulse to stumble.

“They don’t need your consent. You can fight, you can scream inside your own head, and they’ll still make you feel what they want you to feel.”

Something tightens behind my eyes. I can’t tell if it’s panic or if she’s pushing on something in there, but the more I try not to think about it, the harder it presses.

She tilts her head, eyes locking on me like she’s already deep inside.

“I got out. But I took pieces with me. And now I decide where they go… Now I choose what to feed. Who to feed on.”

My throat feels raw when I manage to speak.

“Why me?” I ask, though part of me already knows.

“You don’t spill,” she says. “Most people leak every stray feeling. You keep it locked in. That makes you rare. And very, very useful.”

She stands, steps over the body, checks her phone. “In six days, a ship leaves from Odessa. Eleven on board. Eight like me. Three are much stronger.” Her gaze fixes on me. “You’ll be there.”

“I’m not…”

Her eyes lift, pinning me in place. “You will. Because if you don’t, I’ll pull out that bridge when you were sixteen, and what happened at twenty-four, and those thoughts you keep locked away, the ones you can’t let anyone see, and I’ll make sure the right people hear them. You won’t walk away from that. And there are worse things I could take from you.”

Somewhere outside, a horn blows, low, drawn-out, answered by another. She pockets her phone. “Time to meet the others.”",6,1754831178.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I once spent three months on a hustle that barely covered my coffee bill, but it completely changed the way I approach business. I learned how to negotiate, market myself, and manage my time. Skills I still use in every other hustle I’ve tried since.

It made me realize that even “failed” hustles can be stepping stones to bigger wins.

1mmhyl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1mmhyl9/there_is_hope/,There is hope!,"I (30M) have been following this for a few years on multiple throwaways. My gf (30F) and I have been together for nearly 10 years. I would have proposed years ago but we have had multiple family deaths, suicides etc that has made that push out. Then started the SSRIs and heavy weed smoking to “deal” with it all. Worst thing we could have done, anyway that’s another post for another group probs. We then went through the dead bedrooms and it felt like we were roommates. 

Well this post is a positive post and I am not trying to flaunt it or throw it in anyone’s face but it is just to bring some positivity and hope for everyone who needs it. I know the feeling big time. After alot of thinking and unfortunately how a lot of the posts go in this group I considered us breaking up. I thought for a last ditch effort as I am madly in-love with this girl and she is the love of my life that I would try to fix things once and for all. 

Everything I read into had the same ideas with the same end result of no improvement which is along the lines of the definition of stupid (same approach with the same result thinking it will be different). Talk, vent etc etc. This time I thought what can I do differently and instead of blaming my partner I blamed me. I looked from my partners perspective and thought would I want to sleep with me. It was a rude awakening. I would work all day, come home exhausted and do the bare minimum around the house, then cook dinner if it was my turn and retreat to my PlayStation or mancave to destress. I figured this was making me only stress more and think about the DB and everything else that was wrong in my life. The cycle would continue day to day and I would get more and more frustrated. After this awakening I had a new approach. It was simple to me actions speak louder than words… so I did the below. 

- Started walking with my partner after work every day and discussed all the shit things in the open and none was to be discussed in the home our new happy place.
- Surprised my love with breakfasts in bed (twice a week), coffee with a little love note under it and a big morning cuddle (daily). 
- Stopped PlayStation and limited it to a few hours a week. Instead I would ask my partner what she wanted to do or what shows we could both agree on and watch together. We also cut out the serial killer docos as I didn’t realise what a mood killer they were but like derrr. ‘Shameless’ was a great change with the humour but also multiple sex scenes per episode would really get us going.
- Didn’t just do the bare minimum of chores to get by but also thought hey we aren’t living in the 60s anymore. With the cost of living and the politicians and billionaires fucking up the world both partners now need to work so why should mine be doing majority of the house work and who did I think I was not to share it 50/50. I don’t wait for her to ask I think what needs to be done and get on with it. Also work is easier than being a stay at home parent. Don’t ever think differently. It’s exhausting and is wayyyyyy longer hours. 
- We both cook dinner together most nights and we love it. Unless one is exhausted or has to work late we don’t argue it’s just commonsense to get on with it. 
-Eat dinner together at the table with no distractions, no phones or tv and just discuss our day. No talking about others or the worlds problems just pick an interesting intellectual topic and discuss it in depth. Trivial Pursuit cards have the topics covered if needed.
- I started actually listening to her problems and instead of giving solutions I would stop and say do you want cuddles or solutions and go with whatever was needed. Fellas we don’t have all the solutions. Sometimes we just need to listen and then love. 
- I dropped the porn and masturbation daily as it was just adding to an empty void prior and not satisfying me. I’d say I was a sex addict.
- I deleted my social media apps and would only look once a week and now I just couldn’t care at all about someone else’s fake life. Also my feed was full of half naked sexual girls thinking that’s what I should expect from mine. 
- A few nights a week both shower and get ready for bed together and then she would give me a back massage and I would give her a bum massage (if you haven’t had one of tried it thank me later) 
- SPOONING… don’t expect sex from it every time but wow does it seem to get her going. If we weren’t fucking that night we were the next or within a few days. 
- Board games… the laughter and banter we got out of this made us feel like kids again in the honeymoon phase. Instead of doom scrolling depressing shit or reading some bs AI generated caption or free mongering fake video.
- Dropped all sexual expectations. Let it come naturally and wow do we cum now. Online surveys about how often couples have sex are bullshit. Some weeks or months you may be rabbits and others tortoises. 
- Dropped the resentment. This was making me moody all the time and not a nice person to be around. Further cock blocking me. 
- Exercise!! It doesn’t need to be vigorous but we started doing yoga together. Also a side bonus getting to see her sexy self and camel toe in that active wear. Now it seems that yoga seems to turn into naked yoga and stretching other muscles. Not all the time and only a few but hey that’s new. 
- Take care of ourselves. Not sexually but do the simple shit. Drink water, eat healthy, cut the alcohol to dinner parties or events only. Also no weed or drugs except the occasional doobie on a holiday or weekend away at the beach. Keep fit. 
- Now this one I have been told about for so long and thought yeah whatever but journaling is a game changer. Don’t trauma dump all your shit on your partner. Obviously have good communication about the things that need discussion but if you had a bad day take a moment before you go home and journal. You don’t have to write it down you can record yourself while driving then play it back to yourself and delete it. If you do write it down then read it over and delete it. Go in depth and take all your frustration out then listen or read, process and then forget. Life’s too short to hold onto this stuff.
- Communicate positively. Drop the negatives. Be positive. 
- Compliments!! Take notice of them. The little things matter and mean the most. Not when they are dressed up but at their most vulnerable. 

Really all that changed was instead of coexisting I put in the effort that my partner desired and deserved and let my actions speak louder than words. I’m at the point now where I was just joking today saying “sheeeit why did I ever complain now my dick is about to fall off”. I hadn’t had head in 3 years. Now it’s like the song colt 45 and she really “sucks that dick till the shit turned white”. It may not be the same for all of you here (sorry to the ones who do most in a household and aren’t being satisfied) but going back to the basic things in life, those little moments that when the end comes really are the big moments in life can be the difference. It’s corny AF but live, love, laugh! Don’t just exist, love the person that you love and don’t just tell them fucking show them! Don’t just blame them as it takes two to tango. 

A saying I have also started to live by that has changed my love life and everyday life, career, friendships etc for the better in every way is…
Good, Better, Best. Never let is rest. Until good is better and better is best! 

I hope this can help some of you. I have really been through it and maybe not for as long as some but after playing the blame game and turning the endless talks which lead to arguments into actions on my own part and a hard look at myself it changed everything. Although this group has helped me alot and I wish you all the best I am proud to say that I will be deleting my throwaways and most likely reddit in general. 

I sincerely do wish every single one of you all the best and as mentioned hope that this can help a few of you. There is hope and sometimes we need to turn the spotlight onto ourselves. Remember that everyone is different. Different things work for different situations. You are a smart cookie and if you can be honest with yourself and not just blame the other you will figure it out. In saying this too some situations may be that the love and desire has gone but you can either work to change that and if not then find what you deserve in your life. 

Much love to you all and thank you ❤️

1mmhvzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonesaveApp/comments/1mmhvzr/orukka_a_new_way_to_spend_cryptocurrency_with/,Orukka - A new way to spend cryptocurrency with smart payment rings,"Cryptocurrency has come a long way from being just a speculative asset. More merchants, services, and platforms are accepting it for everyday transactions, making it easier to live in a digital-first economy. The latest innovation in this space? **Smart payment rings**—wearable devices that let you make contactless payments with just a tap of your finger.



# The evolution of smart rings

Smart rings aren’t exactly new. The earliest models in the early 2010s used NFC technology for simple tasks like unlocking doors or making small contactless payments. They were handy, but limited.

Then came fitness-focused rings like the Oura Ring, which introduced advanced sensors for tracking health metrics. These devices proved that a ring could be more than just jewelry—it could be a powerful wearable computer.

Now, smart rings are entering a new phase: **financial utility**. Instead of pulling out your phone or wallet, you can simply tap your ring to pay for coffee, groceries, lunch or train ticket.



# How Orukka Smart Rings works for crypto:

Think of it like a contactless debit card you wear on your finger:

* You top it up from your crypto wallet (Bitcoin, ETH, stablecoins, etc.)
* It instantly converts to a spendable balance
* You tap at any NFC/contactless terminal and the payment goes through

No extra hardware. No weird merchant setup. It rides on the same payment rails your Visa or Mastercard would.

# Why this could actually matter

Right now, crypto is still awkward for daily transactions—you need the right app, the right network, sometimes even the right mood to deal with it. A payment ring removes all that friction.

If stuff like this takes off, we could see crypto spending go from “something you do on your laptop” to “something you do without even thinking about it.”

As at August 2025, Orukka is the first smart Ring startup to launch this. We hope more banks and players follow suit or collaborate with Orukka.

I’m always excited to meet someone who enjoys meaningful conversations, shared laughter, and the comfort of good company. I’d describe myself as kind-hearted, open-minded, and drawn to people who take life as it comes—with grace, curiosity, and a sense of ease.

A bit about me: I have a wide range of interests—from wandering through desert landscapes and discovering local art scenes to curling up with a good book or exploring charming cafés. I also enjoy staying active, traveling, and finding joy in life’s simple pleasures—especially when shared over a warm cup of coffee or tea.

I value genuine connections built on mutual respect, authenticity, and shared experiences. Time tends to fly, and I’ve come to appreciate how the moments we share with others are what truly stay with us.

If you’re someone who enjoys thoughtful conversations and embraces life with warmth and intention, I’d love to connect and see where things go.

Hi everyone,

A little over a year ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut. My days were blending together, and I wasn't feeling particularly inspired or productive. I kept hearing about the benefits of journaling, and while I was skeptical, I decided to give it a try. I stumbled upon the ""Grow Every Day Journal"" and its simple promise was exactly what I needed. I committed to writing in it every single day for a year, and the transformation has been nothing short of remarkable.

Here's how a simple, daily habit changed everything for me:

**1. Finding Clarity in the Chaos** Before journaling, my thoughts were a tangled mess. Taking just 10-15 minutes each evening to write down my day—the good, the bad, and the confusing—acted as a mental declutter. It forced me to confront my feelings and pinpoint the true sources of my stress and my joy. Suddenly, complex problems seemed more manageable when written down on paper.

**2. Cultivating a Habit of Gratitude** One of the prompts I followed was to list three things I was grateful for each day. At first, it felt repetitive. But over time, this simple exercise rewired my brain to look for the positive. Instead of focusing on what went wrong, I started actively searching for small moments of beauty and kindness throughout my day—a warm cup of coffee, a call with a friend, the sun shining through my window.

**3. Achieving My Goals, One Page at a Time** Writing down my goals made them real. I used my journal not just for reflection, but for planning. I broke down large ambitions into small, actionable steps. Seeing my progress tracked on the page was incredibly motivating. It wasn't about massive leaps; it was about the power of consistent, daily effort. The sprout on the cover of the journal became a perfect symbol for this slow but steady growth.

If you're feeling stuck or just want to connect with yourself on a deeper level, I can't recommend daily journaling enough. It’s not about writing perfectly; it's about showing up for yourself, day after day.

 Do you journal? I'd love to hear about your own experiences in the comments below!

1mmhlz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1mmhlz9/how_to_implement_double_meshpaper_filtering_need/,"How to implement double (mesh+paper) filtering? Need a fine mesh strainer, apparently","So, I bought a jar for making cold brew [https://www.amazon.ie/dp/B0C689JX1T](https://www.amazon.ie/dp/B0C689JX1T) . And the result is disappointing: the mesh inset is simply too small, I get a ratio that is too long, the result is drinkable as it is but not a concentrate at all. (I brewed in the fridge for 36 hours).

Then, while on a vacation trip, I tried brewing in a large jar without a mesh inset and with a pretty short ratio (I think it worked out at 1:6), again in the fridge for 36 hours. Then I filtered the coffee through a tea mesh and through V60 paper filters. The result was *good*, but the filtering setup was awkward, requiring two people (one to hold the tea mesh over the funnel, the other to pour). Also even the tea mesh was not very fine and I had to replace the papers a lot.

I'd like to do this same thing without needing an assistant. And at home I have the V60 as a proper paper-filtering funnel. What I don't have is the kind of mesh that would be both fine enough (as fine as the mesh in the jar inset) and conveniently shaped to keep it over the funnel. The jar inset itself would have to be held bny an assistant again, while the smallest mesh in a conventional strainer that I know if is something like this [https://www.amazon.ie/Tala-10A10005-Small-Stainless-Steel/dp/B000TAQOWY](https://www.amazon.ie/Tala-10A10005-Small-Stainless-Steel/dp/B000TAQOWY) , which I do have but it's clearly not fine enough.

There are mesh insets for the V60, but I'd need to stack two V60s which is quite awkward.

So where can I look for this kind of very fine mesh strainer? Or alternatively what other ways are there to set up double filtering?

EDIT: found nylon mesh that actually lists the fineness at [https://www.amazon.ie/KAIYAYA-Kitchen-Strainer-Handle-Plastic/dp/B0F9T5B7VM](https://www.amazon.ie/KAIYAYA-Kitchen-Strainer-Handle-Plastic/dp/B0F9T5B7VM) \- but it's nylon, how hard is it to wash between uses?

1mmhk08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmhk08,Reactivity and how to prevent it before it starts - for new puppy owners.,"Every dog related sub seems to be full of posts looking for advice on how to handle reactivity. As fans of the German Shepherd Dog we all know how common reactivity is within our breed.

I'm not going to share how to stop reactivity as that's another post altogether. I'm going to share how I personally prevent it from even starting to begin with. **This is how I approach it. Other people might do things differently and that's fine. There's more than one way to skin this cat.**

This is going to be helpful for people who are considering a new puppy or who already have a new dog and are wondering how to prevent reactivity from becoming a reality.

First, let's describe ""reactivity"" as it seems to be a catch-all term to describe lots of different types of problems. For the sake of this post I'm talking about what we usually think of when we talk about reactivity, the dog who blows up at the end of a leash - most commonly (but not always) towards other dogs.

What causes reactivity? Typically there's three emotions that the dog is experiencing when they become reactive: frustration, fear, and/or arousal, or any combination of the three.

The next question is, why is the dog feeling these emotions? That's a two part answer: learned behavior/experience and genetic proclivity. I'm not going to get too deep into the woods on these two points but they're important to understand. Briefly, the dog had an experience or a number of experiences that caused this behavior to develop and there's a genetic predisposition for it.

And another thing to touch on is what are known as ""fear periods"" in dogs. Again, I don't want to get to deep into the woods on this but in summary as pups grow and develop they experience fear periods where seemingly inconsequential interactions or experiences can imprint negatively on the dog. If you're looking for more info on this google will return numerous results.

Why is reactivity such a common problem?

In my opinion it has to do with how the everyday dog owner approaches ""socialization."" What does the every day dog owner do with their little puppies? They let every single person and every single dog approach and interact with their puppy. 

They believe that the positive (positive from the humans POV) interactions will create a dog that isn't fearful or aggressive with strangers or other dogs. The owners have nothing but good intentions but what they don't know is they are planting the seeds for future reactivity.

Why does this create reactivity?

Three reasons: 1) the puppy is actually fearful of the interaction and you are allowing the pups worst fears to come true. The pup learns that you will not protect him/her from being approached by strangers and strange dogs and they have to protect themselves. 2) OR, the interaction is so rewarding and so satisfying for the pup that there's nothing you can offer that will outcompete the self satisfaction the pup intrinsically receives from the interaction. And 3) what was formerly a positive experience for the pup becomes negative due to a poor experience with the stranger. For example: they get bit by the strange dog or some strange kid roughly handles them.

How do we prevent any of this while getting the puppy appropriately socialized?

I like to refer to puppy socialization as ""environmental exposure."" The second a new  puppy comes home to me I take them out everywhere. Even if it's just a car ride to get gas or a gallon of milk. I can't stress this enough, I work my ass off to make sure the new puppy sees as many different environments as possible. I take the pup out every. single. day. Parks, parking lots, in-town, stores, gas stations, coffee shops, etc. This creates confidence and social neutrality in the dog. 

What do we do when we're out getting our environmental exposure? We do two things. I put the puppy on a flexi leash and I let them explore but I constantly call them back to me and reward them with food/praise and second, we play. We play with each other alot. We play, play and play some more. This shows the dog that I'm the most rewarding and important thing regardless of what is in the environment.

My goal is to make sure I'm the most rewarding thing to the dog in any environment. Most importantly, I purposely take the pup into distracting environments and towards distractions and practice recalling the pup and/or playing with the pup. I can't stress how important this is.

How do we handle interactions with people and dogs?

There's two schools of thought on this. 1) Let everyone and everything interact with your dog and 2) don't allow your dog to ever interact with other dogs or strange people - ever.

I take a different approach. I will allow very brief interactions that I can control and that I know are going to be beneficial.

Let's talk about people. I don't allow strangers to walk up and touch my puppy or my dog. I stop them in their tracks and tell them NO. This is very important for the pup to see. This way they know you got their back. Second, I don't allow the puppy to just run up and great people. I want them to understand this is unacceptable behavior.

What I will do is this, if someone stops at a distance and asks to pet the puppy, I'll make some small talk with them, (feel them out) give them some instructions on how to pet my puppy and then I will release the puppy to go towards the person. (If the puppy doesn't go towards the person I don't force it) I never let the person come towards the puppy. I will let the interaction go on for no longer then a few seconds. I will call the puppy off the stranger, reward the dog profusely and immediately walk away. I do this very infrequently. Maybe once a week or less if I'm taking the pup out six or seven days a week.

This teaches the dog that strange people are no big deal to concern themselves with either positively or negatively - they just exist like a tree or a rock. 

How do I handle dog interactions?

I never ever allow strange dogs to approach my puppy. And I most certainly never take them to dog parks. One negative interaction can lead to a lifetime of behavioral problems for your dog. But what I do, is introduce them to dogs I know really well who are owned by people I know really well. While the puppy is small I treat the interaction just like I do with people. Brief, positive, infrequent and I always make sure the experience ends with ME being the most rewarding part of it. As the pup matures I'll allow more play time with well known and we'll behaved dogs but again, only occasionally.

I make a deal with the puppy from day one. I won't let strange dogs and strange people bother you and you don't act like a jerk on the end of your leash. Once the dog is about 5 months old or so, I teach loose leash walking and I enforce the rules. 

Get comfortable with telling people NO you and your dog cannot harass my dog. But also be ready to tell your dog NO you can't just go and run up on people or dogs either.

Enforce this for life. Use your best judgement when you do allow interactions. Keep it brief and make certain you're the most rewarding part of the interaction.

This is how I do it. I do not have reactive dogs. I do not have behavioral problems related to reactivity and I have dogs who trust me, follow me and who are incredibly social, confident and outgoing.

**Some people might do things differently. Some people might disagree with what I do. That is OK. This is how I do it and it's been successful for me.**

1mmhia8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mmhia8/explore_the_technivorm_moccamaster_kbt_coffee/,Explore the Technivorm Moccamaster KBT Coffee Maker: Is It Worth It?,"There’s something about starting my day with a perfectly brewed cup of coffee that feels non-negotiable. Enter the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112. I’ve spent several weeks putting this coffee maker to the test, and while it has quickly earned a permanent spot on my kitchen counter, I discovered some nuances worth breaking down. From its design to brewing performance, there’s a lot to unpack here.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
I’ll admit it. The first thing that caught my attention was the polished silver finish. It has this high-end aesthetic that instantly elevates the look of any kitchen. The Moccamaster isn’t just about looks though; the entire build feels solid. It’s not flimsy like other plastic-heavy machines. Measuring just about 6.75 inches deep and 15.25 inches tall, it fits neatly under most cabinets without taking up ridiculous amounts of counter space. Another thing I appreciated is how simple the one-button operation is. No tiny screens, fiddly menus, or overwhelming tech. This simplicity adds to the charm.

**Performance That Delivers on the Hype**  
Here’s where this machine excels. The Moccamaster brews a full 40-ounce pot in just six minutes. I mean, that’s faster than I can shuffle around half-asleep before realizing what day it is. And the coffee? It’s consistently rich, well-extracted, and piping hot. The pre-immersion drip-style system ensures an even bloom, so I’ve noticed my cup tastes better compared to other drip machines I’ve used. It has this 9-hole outlet arm that evenly saturates the coffee grounds, which feels like a game changer for getting that balanced flavor.

**High-Quality Components for Coffee Lovers**  
The thermal carafe deserves its own standing ovation. Let me tell you, it keeps the coffee hot for roughly an hour, but if you’re hosting guests or on an extra-long morning meeting spree (hello, Zoom fatigue), swapping the carafe lid to the travel lid keeps the brew warm even longer. Since this was handmade in the Netherlands with durable parts, it feels designed to last. Oh, the reusable filter? Another eco-friendly bonus I hadn’t expected to like as much as I do.

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b002s4di2s/)

**Merits**  
- Intuitive one-button operation—no learning curve needed  
- Exceptional, evenly brewed coffee flavor  
- High-quality stainless steel thermal carafe  
- Durable, hand-built construction backed by a generous five-year warranty  

**Hurdles**  
- Expensive compared to other drip coffee makers  
- No auto-shutoff feature—forgetfulness strikes again  
- Pouring from the carafe feels slightly awkward, especially for the first cup  

**Other Options**  
It wouldn’t be an honest review without touching on similar competitors in this category. The Moccamaster often goes up against machines like the Breville Bambino or the OXO Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker. While the Breville leans toward espresso drinkers, it lacks the Moccamaster's larger serving capability and elegant thermal carafe design. The OXO Brew, with its programmable settings, feels tech-savvier, but I found its plastic build less durable over time. Where this coffee maker shines most is in its balance of design, durability, and the ability to focus on producing excellent coffee, rather than flashy extra features.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When I saw the price tag, I had second thoughts. I was like, “Can a coffee maker really be worth this?” After using it daily, the answer is yes…mostly. If you’re someone who drinks their coffee plain or invests in high-quality beans, it truly brings out the flavors in a way cheaper models don’t. You’re paying for consistency, longevity, and simplicity—not bells and whistles. That said, for budget buyers, this might be more “aspirational” than practical.

i’m not sure if everyone’s aware of the eggtyler situation and if not that’s ok, im just confused. is anyone able to explain what’s going on?
from what i heard, she (eggtyler) and her friend found + leaked a coffee shop that tyler goes to with his family often, and they went there all the time “in hopes to catch them and talk to them” which looks really strange from a glance as he has small children and he’s just a person who wants privacy. then there was some sort of video of them trying to get into a gated community that was close to his house. they have lost quite a few followers which is obviously gonna happen when you stalk someone, and from everything they post daily im surprised this behaviour hasn’t been called out before, as it’s clear this user has some sort of parasocial relationship with tyler. 
they posted some apology which was mainly them avoiding accountability, saying it was their friend who had the address not her, etc. and that she’s gonna go back to posting as normal. everyone in the comments obviously are concerned about her, saying she needs some sort of help or at least a hobby that doesn’t revolve around someone she doesn’t even know. 
i commented saying something like “hey, this seems unhealthy, he has a wife and small children, you should find a job and go do something else with your life because this is too much.” now i can’t tell you exactly what i commented because after this, she blocked me. woke up this morning blocked. because i disagreed with what she did. she’s been blocking everyone who has opposed her, and is deleting everyone’s comments when they say that she should respect tyler’s need for privacy. 
he doesn’t live in california, he lives in his home state and when celebrities do that it means they don’t want to be followed and stalked. 
can someone please fill me in on what is actually happening?? because i still don’t understand the full story or why she is blocking everyone and deleting everything. she needs to seriously evaluate her life.

not in the way the world possesses,
but in the way a lonely city window
longs for a light across the street,
quiet, inevitable, and deep.

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

Laconic messages with just ""hi"", ""what's up,"" and the likes will be most likely ignored. If I can beat my own laconism when introducing myself here, so can you.",1,1754829439.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I started taking Vyvanse 4 days ago (20mg, titrating to 30mg this week). I’m not a coffee aficionado but I have always enjoyed a cup or two in the morning. I’m functioning fine without it, but it’s the habit of a hot delicious beverage that I am having trouble letting go of. 

So I’m looking for something to replace it that isn’t acidic or caffeinated. I considered decaf but I’m concerned about the acidity.

I do also enjoy tea but have stuck to less acidic peppermint and lavender which is ok but not really that satisfying. Anyone have any other suggestions for a coffee replacement?",3,1754829431.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

I need them for work, travel, and just keeping my sanity in noisy places. Here’s what I’ve ended up with after trying different models:

💎 [**Sony WH-1000XM4**](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/B08MVGF24M) **– my main pick**  
Still the best mix of price, sound, and noise cancelling I’ve tried. On planes I barely hear the engine noise, and in coffee shops it’s like the chatter just melts away, even loud conversations or random yelling from across the room turn into a dull background hum. It’s not total silence, but it’s enough that I can work, read, or just relax without feeling distracted. They’re light on the head, and I can keep them on for hours without sore ears. Battery lasts over a week for me with daily use. So it's really the best noise-cancelling headphones.

**Pros:**

* Strong ANC for travel and office noise
* Comfortable for long sessions
* 30+ hours battery life
* Custom EQ in the app

**Cons:**

* A bit large if you have a smaller head
* Case takes up space in a bag

💰 [**Soundcore Life Q30**](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/B08HMWZBXC) **– best budget choice of noise-cancelling headphones**  
If you don’t want to spend much on noise-cancelling headphones, these are surprisingly solid. The ANC has three modes (indoor, outdoor, travel), which actually make a difference. Sound quality is decent and adjustable in the app. Battery life is crazy long – I’ve gone weeks without charging.

**Pros:**

* Good ANC for the price
* 50-hour battery life
* Lightweight and adjustable EQ

**Cons:**

* Plastic build feels cheaper
* Mic isn’t great for calls

👂 [**Apple AirPods Pro 2**](https://www.marketexposer.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3) **– in-ear option**  
For people who prefer earbuds, these work well in noisy environments. The noise cancelling is stronger than most in-ears I’ve used, and transparency mode is useful when you need to hear what’s going on. They pair instantly with Apple devices and sound clean across different genres.

**Pros:**

* Strong ANC for in-ear style
* Great transparency mode
* Easy pairing with Apple gear

**Cons:**

* 5–6 hours battery before recharging
* Pricey for earbuds

If you want comfortable noise-cancelling headphones with long battery, and great ANC, go for the Sony. On a budget, Soundcore gets the job done. If you want small and pocketable, AirPods are the way to go.",1,1754829386.0,BestOnAmazon,0,1.0,False

I teach high school English. Oscillated back and forth in college and after college on whether or not I should teach, since I have an English degree and limited career/job prospects with stability and benefits.

I am a survivor of preverbal CSA and the memories began to resurface back in the fall. I also have trauma from being physically, emotionally, and verbally abused throughout my childhood and some of my early adulthood from my mother. I also experienced neglect, poverty, and a chaotic, dysfunctional household where we would have financial crisis chronically due to my mom’s negligence and lack of responsibility. I was also the family scapegoat.

I originally decided to find a teaching position while in a relationship with a refugee who shamed me for my lack of a ‘real job’ (I was a barista for years). I wanted to finally have a ‘real’ job and also secure good benefits since I believed that once/when my partner and I got married she could have guaranteed health insurance (she also was a trauma survivor). She soon broke up with me in an extremely cold way not long after I got hired for a position in May. We broke up in June. 

My work takes over my whole life being a new teacher. I spent hours after work and weekends working from home and there was even more work for me last school year with teacher residency work. Then bring on all the meetings (both work meetings and residency meetings), a 45min commute twice a day; waking up at 3:30a-4a, hardly getting any sleep. I also recently been diagnosed with ADHD and didn’t get on stimulants until this past winter or early spring.

I have been on medical leave since spring due to my chronic symptoms and deteriorating health. My return date to work is the 18th for a week of teacher work days, then the school year starts on the 25th. I have been focusing all summer on merely surviving and caring for myself and prioritized my EMDR therapy. We recently did 2 bilateral stimulation sessions and more cognitive memory fragments of the CSA occurred. I became destabilized again after the second one. Felt better a few days ago, only for the fear and dread of returning to work hit me hard yesterday. Was stuck in a flight state in the morning and a freeze state the rest of the day and slept for hours. 

I see my therapist tomorrow. Yesterday I sent him an email regarding my anxiety and dread of returning back to work. Idk if I can feasibly return. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Teacher work contracts will be emailed later in the month too. If I decide to stay I will be forced to stay for the full year. 

I can extend my leave but and later resign due to my illness but thereafter idk what I will do concerning health insurance or work. I could get another barista job or something, but most don’t offer health benefits. Can’t do Starbucks since I burned that bridge after a no-call no show years ago while in between local specialty coffee shop jobs.

Either way, my options are quite bleak.",2,1754829299.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Between a family vacation, getting sick, a wedding in the DR at a god tier golf resort (see picture of wedding portrait, the couple was blessed by me as Jesus), work, and getting sick I've had basically 0 time to enjoy coffee. I still have 2 unopened bags from last months subscription pack, situation is dire. More or less 2 full weeks without coffee until literally yesterday. 

I found myself on Friday sitting on a porch calling camera stores, getting fucked around on bad pricing, and pop comes this text about the ala carte. Dials as always has outdone himself. The searching for notes was really helpful since my girlfriend has almost unilaterally decided she hates anythign without a chocolate note.

1mmhdsr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmhdsr,Bit the bullet and got a DeLonghi Eletta Explore,"We had a Siemens superautomatic for nearly 5 years, got it as a housewarming gift from the in-laws. Terrible machine, I could only get the strongest beans in the store to taste anywhere near palatable. It lacked certain features due to the price range, so basically I could only tweak the grinder in 3 steps and set the volume of water for espresso and lungo. Within a year, it broke, just kept giving errors on start-up, took it back to Siemens, took them 6 weeks to fix it (they even tried to return it to us when we were on holiday, even though we explicitly told them after we found the repair to take too long, and then blamed that on us). Another year later, the machine started leaking; the tube that runs underneath from the reservoir to the heater sprung a leak. My father-in-law fixed that, luckily. Another year later, the brewer started acting up, so we put the famous rubber band around it that helps the spring to eject the pucks. And now, finally, after yet another year or so, even that modification can't get us any decent coffee anymore. It gives out half cups at random, the coffee tastes weird, and, quite frankly, I'm done with anything coffee related with a Siemens brand on it. Did some research, upped the budget, did some more research and came to a choice between a Jura E4 and the DeLonghi Eletta Explore. Seeing how the Jura demands only Jura maintenance products and has basically no easy way to get to the brewer, we went for the DeLonghi. So far (3 days in), we're really happy with it. The app is a bit slow, but we got the coffee beans dialed in immediately. Grinder is set to 5, we have the exact same beans in it as in the other machine and the taste is completely different, much more pleasant and not as bitter, even though it's still quite strong. Since the other machine wasn't that good, we just stuck to what we knew, so it's just L'Or Onyx espresso beans from the supermarket. We're just struggling a bit with the quantities of the drinks, it's so frustrating DeLonghi just puts S, M, L and XL in the machine, instead of giving actual quantities, especially since you can only tweak the amounts of the hot drinks, and not the cold drinks - I don't have a clue how many millilitres my cold brew is, so I keep sticking cups under the machine that are too big. The standard quantities in the booklet seem useful, until you realise it only tells you what an M is for hot drinks, and it doesn't state what the difference is between the sizes, nor what the sizes of the cold drinks are. All in all though, the coffee tastes great, and we're still getting to know the machine. The pucks it produces are solid, as can be seen on the photo here, it only crumbles after it's been in the container for some time. If anyone has tips and tricks for better taste or more control, I'd be very happy. This feels like the beginning of a journey of discovery - I'm sure I'm doing loads wrong and I'd love to learn. This machine can do so much more than the old one (I'm really impressed by the cold brew), and it gives more control, but it doesn't give a lot of guidance. It tells me what to do, but I'm not sure why I'm doing certain things, and how to tweak it to get even better taste from my beans (we set the grinder at 5 because that's the middle, basically, and the app just goes 'that's fine', but I haven't a clue why that's fine).",8,1754829170.0,superautomatic,1,0.9,False

It was 2 a.m., the coffee was cold, and I was still manually tagging faces so guests could get just their own pictures.

That’s when the “what if” hit me:  
What if there was a way to dump the entire gallery somewhere… and it automatically sorted photos by the people in them?

I started tinkering.  
It sounded simple enough — until I ran into reality:

* Lighting changes across the venue confused face recognition models.
* People wore sunglasses, hats, veils, and sometimes turned half-away from the camera.
* Processing speed tanked when I threw 10,000+ images at it.
* Privacy rules meant I couldn’t just store faces any old way.

I went down a rabbit hole of model tuning, batching strategies to keep things fast, and storage architecture that wouldn’t bankrupt me.  
It’s still a work in progress, but I’ve got something that can handle big event photo sets and sort them without me losing a weekend.

Now I’m wondering — for photographers here:

* Do you currently tag/sort manually?
* Have you tried any AI tools for this?
* What would be a “must-have” before you’d trust something like this in your workflow?

1mmha66,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1mmha66/never_fly_oman_air_again/,Never (fly) Oman Air again,"
On the 15th of July, my girlfriend and I were flying from Amsterdam to Muscat on our way to Bangkok. Upon arrival at Amsterdam airport, we tried checking in our luggage however my girlfriends passport was refused by Oman Air ground personnel for supposedly being “too damaged” (there were old coffee stains in there on all Visa pages; note, everything, including the ID card was still legible and the ID card’s RFID chip working, etc.). They claimed we would never get through passport control in Bangkok. Immediately after the rejection we were told  us an emergency passport would not be valid—this was wrong and almost made us miss our flight. So when they denied us boarding (read: checking in our luggage) my girlfriend went to the authorities (Marechaussee) whom actually check the passports, they said the passport was: “admittedly a little dirty but good to fly”. The Marechaussee even told this to the manager at luggage checkin over the phone but he still refused to let us on the plane. The Marechaussee then checked applicable legislation and found out an emergency passport would allow us to arrive to our destination. As said, the Oman Air personnel did not want to budge, they were all sure that an emergency passport could not be used to enter Thailand. They made several calls to ultimately find out the applicable law prescribed it could; something that we had earlier showed them. 

Here’s where the story even gets better. 

Upon boarding the plane we found out, to our surprise, we had (at online checkin) been upgraded to business class. Very nice after a rather stressful checkin. 5 minutes after we were seated someone from (what we believe to be their air personnel) came up to us telling us we had to go back to Economy class because “we are not allowed to give free upgrades”. We were like, “mmm, sure okay. Do we get to sit next to each other?”. To which he responded “unfortunately not, no”. 

We expressed our concerns to Oman Air in several messages to which we received, if you can even call it that, a generic response saying that “it is your our own responsibility for valid travel documentation”— they did not even read the whole email, so much was apparent. Note, this took them more than 8 days after we reached out. Honestly, I’ve never felt like an airliner gave less shits about their customers and whose customer support team is as inexistent as theirs is.

**Developing a Psychiatric Service Dog as My Natural Chill Pill**  
  

# 🎙️ Opening

Some mornings, the air wakes before I do. It stands at the edge of my bed, humming with a low, wordless tension—my old friend, anxiety—arriving like an uninvited guest who knows exactly where the coffee is.

And then there’s Maui.

The weight of his body spooned to my belly is not heavy. It’s *anchoring*. A pulse of quiet in my storm. If my breath is a fluttering moth, his presence is the open palm it lands upon.



# 💔 The Problem

I was not born with an easy nervous system. My body collects alarms like seashells—sometimes from real storms, sometimes from the imagined ones my mind rehearses.

I had learned the “official” way to train a Psychiatric Service Dog—structured lessons, checklists, the tidy curriculum that the professionals taught me when I attended the School for professional trainers. Obedience first, then task work: find any item, deliver it, be steady in any environment.

It worked… on paper. But paper doesn’t soothe a racing heart at 6 a.m. Paper doesn’t breathe with you.



# 🔥 Story Narrative

By the time Maui “graduated,” I had a dog who could ace any skills test. But when I brought him home, I realized the real work was just beginning.

I invented a morning ritual—not in the manuals, not on the certification checklists—born from equal parts need and instinct.

The rules were simple:

●        First thing in the morning, after my ritual long deep breathing exercise, before words or screens, I’d greet him with a soft, “Good morning.”  
  


●        He’d roll onto his side, sleepy-eyed, tail sweeping in slow arcs.  
  


●        I’d guide him gently onto his back so that his paw could rest against my leg, my grounding post.  
  


●        And then, slow body rubs—long, steady strokes—while I sang his “I love you” song.  
  


It became his favorite. Mine too. The same song would later become his *safety anchor*, a way to tell him, even in the middle of a chaotic store or on a crowded street: *We’re safe. You’re safe. I’m safe.*

Most mornings, we did this before I even sat up. Maui learned to wait for it, expect it, welcome it. I learned that if I started his day in joy, my own anxiety loosened its grip.

# 🧠 Science & Psychology

What we were doing—without naming it—was co-regulation.  
 When two beings rest in each other’s presence, breathing slows, heart rate steadies, cortisol drops. Touch paired with predictable, gentle rhythm activates the parasympathetic nervous system—the “rest and digest” mode that is the opposite of anxiety’s fight-or-flight surge.

Dogs, with their ability to attune to human heart rate and breath, can serve as living biofeedback. Studies show that petting a dog can lower blood pressure, slow respiration, and reduce stress hormones in both humans and canines.

# 🌿 Symbolism & Archetype

In Jungian terms, Maui became the *Servant-King* archetype—not one who commands, but one who offers his gifts in presence, mirroring my own slow journey toward self-service through service to another.

In Sanskrit, *Seva* means selfless service. Yet it was never one-directional. Each morning, as I tended to his joy, he tended to my peace.



# 🌌 Dream Sequence

Around this time, I dreamt I was carrying a glass jar full of fireflies through a crowded train station. Every bump of a stranger’s shoulder risked shattering the jar. Maui walked beside me, and the crowd seemed to open for him—space blooming around his body. I made it to the platform without losing a single light.

**Interpretation:** The fireflies were my fragile moments of calm. Maui was both the shield and the space-maker, guiding me to a place where what was delicate could remain intact.



# ✨ Turning Point

The turning point was realizing that Maui’s *service* was not in performing tasks but in being woven into my nervous system’s rhythm. The checklist-trained dog was useful. The dog who knew my breath was medicine.



# 🧘‍♀️ Closing Ritual or Reflection

**Morning Anchor Practice**  
 Before your day begins:

1. Begin Long-Deep-Breathing
2. Sit with your dog.  
3. Invite touch in a way your dog enjoys—long, predictable strokes.  
4. Pair it with a gentle, repetitive phrase or hum.  
5. Match your breathing to the rhythm of your strokes.  
6. Let the moment finish before the world rushes in.  



# 🕯️ Final Echo

Sometimes the truest training begins after the certificate is framed.

# 📋 Quick Reference Guide

**Your Dog as Morning Medicine**

●       **Anchor Before Action**  
 Start the day with touch and breath before tasks—this sets a nervous system baseline.  
  


●       **Pair a Phrase with Peace**  
 A song or mantra now can become a safety cue later.  
  


●       **Let Them Serve by Being**  
 Tasks are helpful; attunement is healing.  
  


●       **Make it Mutual**  
 Service is a two-way current—when you give, you receive.  
  


*You don’t need to be still to find peace—you just need a place to rest your breath.*

*And the Dog Knows the Way*

1mmh557,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1mmh557/life_in_paris/,Life in Paris,"I wake up at 5AM to the vibration of my smartwatch. I walk three steps away from the bed and unroll the extra set of blankets in this studio apartment. I do my 108 bows in complete silence and meditate. I then find myself in a bit of a pickle: what do I do now?

The studio we are staying at has no separate room and I’ve spent a few days trying to do things in the dark room where my wife is sleeping after a night-long battle with jetlag. The strain on my eyes were a bit too much after a few days so I just hopped on to the bed again and dozed off for a few more hours.

I’ve been feeling the itch to write again but I didn’t realize how much I depended on my environment to write. Having a room where I can gather thoughts in a bit of silence, being able to make a bit of noise without disturbing others, these had become a part of my writing routine. Being in a studio apartment in a culture where noise is deeply frowned upon from 10pm-7am, the first 2 waking hours have been tough.

Yesterday I stepped outside to find a place I can plug my keyboard and write a bit freely. Something I learned about France is, nothing is really open in the early morning except the train station. So I walked to the Montparnasse train station and settled myself on one of the waiting area desks and started writing.

The internet made it sound like the French are posh, condescending arses who look down upon your horrible French accent. The internet also made it sound like Parisians are the most cocky of them all. But in my personal experience it’s been the complete opposite of that. The French are very abundant with their smiles and they look into your eyes as you ask them to speak a bit slowly.

The man who sat next to me asked about my bluetooth keyboard. He seemed very impressed and I told him that it helps me not use my thumb to write long texts like this. Another thing I noticed: older people tend to speak more English than the younger people. He dozed off while watching YouTube and it was 8AM, the time the cafe at our street opens, so I decided to walk back.

I didn’t realize how much I enjoy walking. It’s very weird, according to my step counter it’s the same 10k steps but 10k steps in California seem like a very boring chore while 10k steps in Paris seems like a quick stroll around the neighborhood. Walking my dogs for an extended walk, all I see is houses and more houses along with strip malls all coated in beige. Walking to and from the train station to the studio, I see so many people living life.

I think that makes a difference in how you perceive yourself in connection to your community and surroundings. When I’m at Costco, I definitely see a lot of people but they’re all doing one thing: shopping at Costco. When I’m at a busy cafe in Los Angeles I see a lot of people, again doing the same thing: drinking coffee. When I’m walking in Los Angeles I rarely see people in the streets because people are mostly driving.

In Paris as I walk I see a group of people sitting outside of a cafe enjoying breakfast. I see people walking to their destinations. I see people repairing their bikes and people waiting for the bus. Some people are sitting and chatting, some people are enjoying some smoke time in the middle of their shift. My walking reminds me that I’m part of this collective organism of a community, at least for this moment.

A few hours pass and the street landscape looks completely different from the morning. As more shops open more people are out in the streets and there are sounds of life. My wife and I grab a quick bite from our haul at the local markets and venture outside again. Taking the bus, the metro, walking, stopping, taking pictures and videos, we have what you might call a typical day but this typical day was very missing from our life in America.

My wife grew up in Korea where public transportation is abundantly available. I used to be a Southern California drive-anywhere-and-everywhere kind of guy but now that I’ve experienced both public transportation and driving for an extended period of time I can see how needing to drive to places shapes your life in a certain way. This change is especially pronounced for my wife because she came from a completely different culture of not needing to drive at all.

Now that we’re both in a place where public transit is part of everyday life we’re out more. It is so nice to not have to care about parking, unprotected left turns, and whatever else you have to think about when you drive. This only works because we’re in an urban area where all the things you typically need to drive to are in walking distance. What will we think of a European suburban environment? Guess we’ll have to find out.

Soon it becomes evening and this is when the streets are the most full of life. It feels like all the people stayed in their cocoons to turn into a butterfly in the evening. All the food businesses are filled with people inside and outside as people wine and dine. We’ve been trying to cook more so we head back to the apartment to prep dinner but when we open the windows to let the sound of the streets in it’s like we’re bustling with them.

Cooking… Leaves a lot to be desired especially because this is such a small space. Pots have no lids so rice cooking has been difficult, heat is induction so it’s been hard to fix a “quick” meal. But even if the cooking is a bit horrible from the perspective of cooking techniques or equipments, the flavor is exception because the ingredients are all exceptionally good.

Late PM is my usual time when I have clients, so in between clients I do the cooking and eating. After that we shower up and wrap up the day. This has been life in Paris so far. How are you doing, wherever you are?

Photo is of the space currently—it just feels too tight to get around coffee table (image glass rectangle on the base) from the couch or tv. 

We measured and can fit the couch on the wall in front of the windows (a couple inches left on each side). The opposite wall should be big enough for tv (and then there are French doors into the room so that wall isn’t long enough for the couch). 

Thoughts on trying the placement? the hang up is that we just ordered a 9x12 rug so if we do this, the couch will be on the short side of the rug and I feel like it’s going to look silly.

And if you’re wondering, why not put the couch on the tv wall? On the opposite wall with the radiator is another French doors with glass panes. We could close the doors but don’t love the look or feel (may cut off air flow). 

And and we decided on a 9x12 rug initially bc we wanted maximum coverage for the dog - she has mobility issues and can’t move as freely on noncarpet… so we could return/replace with an 8x10 but that would limit a safe space for her and honestly maybe that would look silly with how much room btw the tv and rug?",1,1754828181.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

Then she would submerge that layer in still water so the art separates form the transparent layer and starts floating on the water. Then she would slowly transfer the art from water to coffee mug by submerging the coffee mug into water and slowly pulling it out. The mugs were so beautiful.

The show sparked international outrage. Toward the end of the set, Carr delivered what he called a ‘career ender’ – a joke about the Holocaust, in which he described the Nazis’ murder of thousands of ‘Gypsies’ as a ‘positive’.

The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial, and the UK government condemned the joke as ‘appalling’, ‘abhorrent’, and ‘racist’; Carr, critics said, was trading on the ‘last acceptable form of racism’.

Comedy touches every part of our lives. We tell jokes at the pub, around the dinner table, and by the office coffee machine. We all know someone who makes us laugh – and someone who seems to take things too far. But *is* there a line when it comes to humour? And if there is, who gets to draw it? Should we suspend our moral judgements when the lights go down and the curtain goes up? Or do jokes, like most speech acts, carry moral weight?

To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of comedy itself – what *exactly* it is we’re responding to when we laugh. Humour might be a release of nervous tension, a playful disruption of expectations, or – more troublingly, if it applies to Carr’s joke – a means of asserting social superiority. No doubt, comedy has the power to shape our culture and perceptions. But, as we’ll find out, it also tells us something about who we are, who we ought to be, and the things we value most.

Title: I Debugged Her Code… Now She’s My Girlfriend. Did I Just Hack Love?

Post:

> I’m a 25-year-old software engineer. A few weeks ago, a girl from my shared workspace was struggling with a nasty bug in her code. She’d been stuck for days, so I offered to take a look.

One “quick check” turned into me staying up until 2 AM rewriting a part of her logic and documenting the fix. The next day, she was so impressed (and relieved) that she insisted on buying me coffee.

That coffee turned into a 4-hour conversation, and now… we’re dating.

My friends keep teasing me, saying I “coded my way into her heart” and that she probably liked my skills more than me at first.

I’m wondering — is this just how modern attraction works? Do skills like coding actually make someone more appealing, or did I just get lucky?

I have spent hours  asking it about the Baltic states, their entrance into the EU, and Ukraine and its history. I learned about the internal political struggles of Russia and how the Ukraine war has played into it. 

I say this because this account was helpful for me to understand how people feel and how the war really feels in context or what I learned. It’s an incredibly engaging learning tool and grounds what I am interested in. 

Here is my prompt
“Write me a first person account of what being a Ukrainian soldier on the front lines is like”

——

I wake up to the hum before the blast.

It’s the sound of a drone somewhere in the gray above the trench, a thin mosquito note that crawls under your helmet and nests behind your eyes. You learn to sort the hums the way city people learn traffic—Mavik, FPV, something heavier. We call out “birds” on the radio. Someone throws a net over the trench roof. I tuck my chin and wait for the sky to decide who gets to live in the next minute.

The ground in front of me is a wet, chewed seam. We dug this trench by hand and shovel and swear word, then lined it with broken pallets and sandbags that leak like old men. We named the dugout “Malibu” because soldiers are cruel with humor; there’s a painted palm tree on the plywood door and a nail for hanging body armor when we pretend to sleep. The door doesn’t close. It just leans there, like all of us.

Breakfast is a metal mug of coffee strong enough to polish boots and a packet of buckwheat warmed on a candle in a tin can. The candle is paraffin and sawdust; it smells like my grandfather’s shed. I eat with gloves on and mud on the gloves. Mud is our extra rank here—Lieutenant Mud, Captain Mud, General Mud. It outranks artillery, drones, officers, promises. It gets into your socks and your jokes and your prayers.

My callsign is “Page,” because I read on rotation when the shells pause and because I used to teach high school literature. On patrol, the guys sometimes ask me to quote things to “keep the angels busy.” Today they want something short. “We must imagine Sisyphus happy,” I say, and Kaban snorts and says Sisyphus obviously didn’t have to carry two crates of 7.62 up the communication trench while being watched by robots.

We check the jammers. They hum like angry wasps—good wasps, our wasps. They don’t make us safe, just slightly less doomed. The air is full of small negotiations like that.

At first light, we glass the tree line with a thermal scope. The world converts to ghosts and embers. There’s heat where heat should not be: a truck idling in the folds beyond the berm, a cluster of men in the ditch who don’t belong to us. In another life, I taught kids how to annotate poems. Here, I annotate distance and wind and the shape of metal against leaf. We pass a grid to the battery. “Copy,” the voice says, flat and distant, like talking to your future self across a bad connection.

The round lands too far left. We adjust. Second round is a punctuation mark on a sentence we didn’t want to write. Someone’s truck stops existing. The radio says words we can’t print in a church bulletin. Kaban makes tea.

Incoming comes like weather. You learn the dialects: 120s cough; 152s bark; cluster whispers and then becomes a swarm. When it starts, we crouch and count. Counting is a superstition and a metronome: one, two, three—impact—four, five—impact—okay, they’re walking it. We move when the math says move. We freeze when the math says freeze. The body understands ballistics long before the brain does.

Around noon, a quadcopter sneaks low along the trench line like a curious crow. Its camera blinks. We stay statues. Heat discipline, movement discipline, silence discipline. No cigarettes on the parapet; no metal glint; no waving at death to show you are brave. Bravery gets confused out here. Survival is the only lecture that sticks.

We rotate a fire team to the forward pit. The path is a spine of duckboards, a trench ribboned with water the color of tea. There are frogs in the trench. They hop away from our boots and return when the world stops thundering. The frogs don’t care about flags. It comforts me and infuriates me in equal measure.

At the forward pit, Skeleton—thin kid, cheekbones like coat hooks—stares into the distances with a face that hasn’t decided if it’s twenty or forty. He points with his chin: “See that roof? Watch it breathe.” I watch. It does—a slow heaving under green netting. People breathe. Tanks don’t. We log it. We wait for the chain to move the note toward someone with bigger fists.

A siren in my head goes off an instant before the ground does: an FPV’s whine rising to a scream. We dive by instinct, hands over helmets, the world flips to dust and ringing. When the sound returns, it comes in pieces—someone calling a name, someone using the good swears, someone laughing because laughter is a tourniquet for the brain. Kaban’s fine. Skeleton’s fine. My hand is shaking like I’m cold, but I’m not cold, I’m here.

We check bodies, gear, radios. A fragment bit into the timber and died there. The trench wall has a new mouth. We file that under “improvements by enemy,” the joke we tell when a shell saves us work by digging.

There’s a lull after, the kind that makes you suspicious. Lulls are ambushes in disguise. We use it anyway: tools out, sandbags patched, wire tightened, batteries swapped. I change socks, the single greatest luxury of war, second only to sitting in a chair that isn’t trying to remember you.

A volunteer truck rattles up in the rear—flour, cigarettes, a box of tourniquets, and two loaves of bread wrapped in a towel that smells like a kitchen. The driver is older than my father and younger than my fear. He smiles with his whole face like we’re neighbors, and for five minutes we are. He leaves us a letter from a class in Ternopil: crayon tanks with sunflowers growing out of the barrels. Skeleton tapes one to the dugout wall next to a pinup calendar and a saint’s icon. We are a cathedral of contradictions.

Afternoon becomes evening without anyone asking it to. The sky bruises. Distant outgoing makes a slow drumline to the south. We eat stew from a plastic bucket, passing the spoon because we’re out of clean ones. I read three pages by headlamp from a book a medic tucked into my vest: a battered paperback about a long-ago war where men also made jokes and promises they weren’t sure they would keep. Kaban says the book needs more explosions. Skeleton says the book has enough explosions; it needs a girl who writes letters she never sends. We argue art like we aren’t dressed like scarecrows.

Night is when the drones multiply. They like the dark; they like our breath. We string chemlights low and keep radio chatter clipped. The jammers hum. The rats hold a little conference under the duckboards and go about their empire. Somewhere to the east, flares go up and hang like second moons. When a flare lifts, everyone forgets how to breathe until it dies.

Around midnight, we get a medevac call on the company net. Another sector, same map, same century-old verbs: carry, drag, lift, press. The voice on the net is nineteen and older than God. We listen because listening is what we can give. When they say “stable,” we let our shoulders slide down two centimeters.

In the small hours, quiet arrives like a shy animal, and—rare gift—stays. You should sleep in quiet, but quiet is when the mind opens its backpack and dumps the day on your boots. I try a trick a psychologist taught us on rotation: name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. I see mud, tape, a saint’s face, a cartoon tank, Kaban’s boots. I touch wood, cloth, steel, my own wrist. I hear jammers, wind, a far dog. I smell cordite and stew and damp wool. I taste metal. It works enough.

Dawn is always older than night. We start again: scopes, ranges, jammers, jokes. Somewhere, a staff officer draws a line on a map that does not have our frogs on it. Somewhere, a grandmother bakes bread and wraps it warm in a towel. Somewhere, my mother texts me a photo of our kitchen table with a place set I will not sit at today. I text back a picture of the cartoon tank and the saint and the pinup taped to our plywood wall. She sends a heart. I send a thumbs-up. Elation is too big to fit through these networks; so is despair. We trade in small coins of normal.

Why do I fight? People ask like it’s a philosophy exam. Some days it’s clean: because home is behind me and someone is trying to erase it. Some days it’s messy: because Kaban laughs like a cracked bell and Skeleton’s hands shake until he’s got a task and because the old man with the bread drove into the dragon’s mouth and came back. Mostly it’s because the man to my left believes I will be here when the sky clears, and I want him to be right.

Around noon, the hum comes back, thin and insistent. We look up without moving. We pull the net a little tighter. We bend our necks and make ourselves smaller than we are. The trench breathes with us. The day sharpens. The drone chooses. We wait for the math and the mercy. Then we climb the ladder again.
