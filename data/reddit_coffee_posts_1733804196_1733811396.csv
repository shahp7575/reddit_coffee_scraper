1havcsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1havcsr/a_story_ive_been_working_on/,A story I've been working on,"There isn't a clear plan, direction or purpose to it right now; I just started writing it one night when I couldn't sleep and I've been adding to it when I feel like it.  

The likely direction I'll take is building on the main character's lack of purpose to lead him into a friend group with his coworkers. However, their friendship devolves into the MC and his closest colleague feeding off each other's worst attributes. The third friend is the much more stable and level-headed person in the group and helps visualise their detachment from their daily lives. 

The MC and his mysterious best friend join a secret society. I'm stuck between going the cult or occult route. If the former, I'd build a lot more on their psychological traits; and explore the characters' pasts and inner workings. If the latter, the horror in the book would come more from messing with dark magic and spirits. 

Either way,  MC and his new friend spiral further and eventually go missing. The other friend uses her wits to find her missing coworkers. Her search leads her to the MC, who describes what happened to him and his friend in their time missing. The last missing friend's whereabouts are left unclear, but it's implied that he has either left town with the other secret society members or has died.

I've always been the odd one of the group and I can say maybe it's due to my shy nature and I was struggling to connect with people. Also, I didn't know I had autism growing up. Long story short, I moved away from family, friends, and everyone I knew. I'm living in a new environment and have been for the last 2 years, I think. It's hard for me to, say ""Hey, you seem really cool, you wanna grab coffee?"" And I share a car with my spouse and he mostly uses it for work. I can't reach out to friends, one of them is hard to reach,and the other would always gaslight me when I was friends with her. I have OCD, depression, and anxiety. I know I have my problems, but is there anyway I can reach out to anyone? Talk to someone, maybe? I can't talk to husband about my OCD. He thinks that I can better myself and I have it in me to quit my OCD. My OCD involves him so that's why it's hard for him to go through it with me. 

As pathetic as this sounds, I'm feeling lonely. I think often I talk to people too much when I get to because I know I will never get the chance to in awhile. Maybe that scares people away. I'm an introvert if you couldn't tell, but I'm having issues connecting with others

I would like to plan some financial goals for 2025 for myself as I would like to buy a house with my partner in the next few years. We are close in salary and can expect to see increases as we promote in the next few years (getting closer to $90k in 2ish years).

I’ve been working full time for about 6 months now. I started at $72,000 salary and about $8,000 in bonus this year. In this time, I was able to contribute 10% to my 401k and save $15,000 in a HYSA. I was working towards having $15,000 as my emergency fund in the HYSA. We have no debt or car payments. 

Now that I have reached my emergency savings goal, I would like to start a separate bucket in my HYSA. It will be a general savings bucket for house down payment, vacations here and there, etc but with the ultimate goal of a down payment. 

Going into 2025, my salary has increased to $82,000. I plan to increase my 401k contribution by 1% and will keep increasing when I receive raises with the goal of maxing it out eventually. I am receiving my full employer contribution of 12% which will be deposited once a year in full. 

I have been tracking my expenses since August to see where my money is allocated and learning to budget. I had the 50/30/20 budget in mind, but with saving more than 20% when possible. Most months, I have contributed a bit more than 20%.

Based on my tracking from August to now:
The largest expense is my rent. With utilities, I pay around $1,350/month. Groceries usually around $350/month. Eating out/coffees is usually around $300/month (something I want to reduce). Gas around $150/month. $200/month on recreation (outdoorsy gear, concert tickets, etc). I have also spent $200/month ish on clothes, but I have been building up my professional wardrobe with summer and now winter attire, so I feel okay with this since I know I’m investing in these pieces. I’ve spent around $1700 on gifts in the past six months (this includes Christmas, birthdays, wedding, bachelorette). $100-$200/month on beauty/wellness (hair appt, makeup, etc). Around $500 on vacation in this time. Then there’s the typical expenses that pop up such as a doctor visit here and there, renters insurance, car insurance (pay in full as they come up). I have a few subscriptions - gym, music, car wash, apple iCloud storage. 

There are definitely some categories I should cut back on, such as eating out/coffee, clothes, and shrinking the gift category some. 

I have one credit card (790 credit score). I am considering opening a travel card when there is a good points offer because we would like to go on an international trip in the next year. 

Just looking for any financial tips or opinions as I am very green to all of this and learning to budget and maximize accounts! I plan to listen to some podcasts on personal finance, too. Are there any goals I should have in mind for the next year? ",1,1733810498.0,personalfinance,0,1.0,False

1hav71u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusLegal/comments/1hav71u/vexatious_litigator_neighbors_and_council/,Vexatious Litigator Neighbors and Council Refusing to Approve Redrawn Plans,"Hi All.

Seeking some advice regarding my family's situation.

For context, we've had a home business (hair salon) running for over 20 years on our street with no issue. About 10 years ago, we made adjustments to part of our house to extend this business. We assumed that everything our builders had done went through the proper procedures. Apparently this was not the case, and that this extension was not approved. This was completely our fault. Furthermore, another member of my family runs a coffee van which is parked at our property but operates in another suburb.

Recently, our neighbors on one side of our house have decided to make their disapproval of our home business known, playing loud, sometimes inappropriate music during salon operating hours and by making claims to the council about both the salon and coffee van. Some of these claims are fair reports about working past operating hours, parking  and salon capacity- which my family has been trying their best to fix and adhere to, others have been purely false claims and reports which I believe have been meant to intimidate my family members.

My neighbours use system of cameras outside their home to monitor customers in the salon, and have on numerous occasions, entered the salon to express their disapproval of things such as where the customers park. They will report even the slightest infraction, such as having a car parked in an improper spot, or working a few minutes past the agreed closing time: which is difficult due to our inability to constantly monitor our customers parking and arrival times. We have clear signage about parking and working hours.

This issue was further complicated however by these same neighbours making a complaint to the council about the aforementioned unapproved plans (something that was unknown even to my family members). We worked with a 3rd party company to fix and redraw the plans of our house to get this approved, with these changes costing around 30 thousand dollars. When we finally finished all the adjustments to our property, redrafted plans and did everything we thought we needed to do- our plan was rejected by the council. Our contact at the company we have been working with described the council (or councillor she contacted) as very different to others she has worked with. Completely unwilling to approve the plan. We have been told our only option is to appeal this in a higher court.

This has taken a serious toll on my family, with huge economic, physical and emotional strain. Is there any other option than to appeal this at court?",0,1733810458.0,AusLegal,4,0.5,False

1hav3wj,https://v.redd.it/jmfczwcnny5e1,OPV help on new setup needed (Timemore 64D and MiCoffee V2),"Yikes… almost at my wits end.  2 hours in and finally have a decent cappuccino.

I’m on day 3 of my setup.  I received my  Normcore bottomless filter with a Normcore basket… and also bought an IMS 18-20 Big Bang basket.

I have my OPV set accurately on my machine (set it with the silicone disk and portafilter).  But I’m finding it impossible to get anything more than 4 bars of brew pressure even with my grind setting set at zero (1-4 is recommended espresso setting) with either one of the new baskets.  I figured out I could get 9 bars on the basket that was included with the MiCoffee….. which is a bit more convex (not the pressurized basket).

My question is why can’t I use the better baskets and get an appropriate brew pressure?     I’ve tried 18, 19 and 20 grams (just in case I did not have enough volume) and I’m using the Normcore spring loaded V4 tamper.  I have it set with the spring that came installed.

I’m including a video of my setup and the baskets.  On the left is the basket that came with the MiiCoffee.  Middle basket is IMS and basket on the right is Normcore.",1,1733810132.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Let me give you some back story.

**Backstory:**  
I was my parent caretaker since I was 12 years old until I moved out and went to college 5 hours away in 2019. Not that my parents couldn't take care of themself but because I am easily manipulated and want to not get yelled at. I did my moms laundry, cleaned their room, washed their sheets, made dinner by 6pm, made her lunches, coffee and tea in the morning, and clean the whole house on a weekly basis.  Had to wake my mom up for her pills at 4am, from 4am to around 6am I was in and out of bed for every 15 minutes cause she wanted 15 more minutes like I had a snooze button. When I rebelled about any of this or forgot to wash something I was grounded.  But when I moved out my younger siblings didn't do anything listed above for them. Before my older sister moved out I was mentally and physically abused until I was 14, I finally let my parents know at the age of 16. I was sexually assaulted multiple time by my older brother, but I never told them because I don't need or want pity.

**This past Thanksgiving:**  
I go home every once in a while, but during thanksgiving was I think my last straw. While I still have to go to the house,I see both my abusers but I sat across the table and didn't talk to them. I moved away got two degrees and im working on my next one while working a full time Job and becoming a alright adult. Before I came home I had to deal with my younger brother shoving it in my face that he makes more than me even without having a High school diploma. Now he is jobless and still living at home at the age of 19. He eats off my parents dime and they do not discipline him at all. He also disrespects my parents in more way than I can describe.

At Thanksgiving I was in the kitchen and he come in and casually grab a bottle of Whisky and starts taking shots, I look at my mom like **""you're going to encourage this behavior"".** And while he drinks he also smokes weed my mom buys for him. When I was growing up we were disciplined to have resect and we would never be caught dead with weed, vape, or alc. which at some point my younger sister was caught with a vape and my step dad would trash her room and literally threw her across the room so of course this was a shock to me. younger brother was in the kitchen, I said why are you take so many shots, and then said well I don't see you drinking. I then said **""Im not here to get drunk is Thanksgiving dude"".** He then proceeded to say **"" Oh I thought you were just pregnant"".** I walked away. During thanksgiving dinner as the whole family was playing games together he decided to go upstairs for the rest of the night and get high.

A few days after we matched we went out on our first date (on a Saturday) which was super fun and I just felt so comfortable and such a good connection with him.

The next week was Thanksgiving and he was off work, I had to be out in his area (we live an hour away from each other) and brought him a pie. He bought me flowers and a plant. It was super sweet, I've never had anyone do that for me. He also kissed me on this meeting for the first time.

We talked for hours after, he stayed over, stayed for a bit in the morning for coffee and it was super nice. I felt like we had gotten closer. He said he hadn't been with anyone in 2 years and was picky so that made me feel like I was good since he chose me.

4th date he invites me to his place for dinner, I stay the night. There were a couple things that bothered me on this meeting. He was showing me something on his phone and I looked at the 'recently used' apps and Hinge was the first one on there. I KNOW that we are dating and in the early stages...but this man and I had talked about how we were dating to marry and I felt that things were going well. We also met on FB Dating, so seeing that he had MULTIPLE dating apps was concerning. I paused my app after the second date then deleted it before this date (no I didn't tell him) because I felt so strongly and was like ""wow we have so much in common, conversation is great, sex is great, everything is great"". I didn't feel it was necessary for me to tell him and if he saw it well then whatever... I told him I was an all or nothing type of person and I don't mind being monogamous or showing someone I'm willing to commit to them (or at least, stop going on dating apps and LOOKING for other people if that makes sense.) 

I'm a single mom and I haven't been in the dating game for over 7 years. The first dating app date I went on was with a guy who also was a gentleman at first, then ghosted me after sleeping with me 3 times. This was two months ago.

We text every day all day, good night good morning, sometimes talk on the phone. Obviously we aren't over the top we both work but it's throughout the day and it's interest from both sides. But I keep getting this feeling like he's been emotionally pulling away already. We even had this great conversation the morning after the 4th date over breakfast that he made, we have a lot in common and have been through similar hard stuff in life, he said it was a good conversation afterwards. I'll say ""youre handsome to me"" or ""I like you"" but he doesn't tell me I'm pretty, or that he likes me. He says ""you look great"" or ""you're pretty ok to me"". It kind of throws me for a loop. He was a bit more flirty in the beginning, and now things have kind of simmered down. I feel like I'm trying to be flirty and show my interest more but he hasn't even asked me if I want to hang out again this Saturday (my only free night.) I've kind of been wondering if I should just pull away at this point, like maybe I'm making myself too available.

I get it. We're in the beginning stages of ""dating"" but why respond immediately to my texts and put in that much effort to communicate every single day if you're not feeling it? Or he is feeling it, and I'm over thinking things? I feel like he's almost friend zoning me right now? But FWB-zoning because he's obviously attracted to me.

I (21M) was in my apartment lying down on my couch watching TV around midnight. My only roommate (21M) who has a career lined up at a major bank tried to argue with me about turning down the TV volume which I did. He then tried to force me to put headphones on. When I ignored his request he went to back his room which was right next to the TV. He then unexpectedly came out of his room and approached me coldly and silently looking around then he grabbed my plate from the coffee table and smashed it so hard right next to me then ran back to his room.

I was so shocked that I quickly ran back to my room, locked the door, and called the police but since I was in such denial to call 911 (I called the non-emergency number), the police just thought it was a ""roommate disagreement"" even though I barely said anything to my roommate. The police report went straight to my University and they did nothing while he continued harassing me. I developed PTSD and struggled weeks after to do anything. I even had to go back to my parent's home because I thought my roommate would try to retaliate.

I can't really do much about this issue and my landlord refuses to move me to another unit. I have tried calling the police department trying to reiterate that it was assault but they think I'm just trying to get out of my lease. I tried getting an emergency order of protection but the judge did not care about my failing health. No department in the University has contacted me about any restitution and I am basically on the verge of failing classes living in a cramped dorm. So much for for trying to do the right thing.

1hauwtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TruthfullyALie/comments/1hauwtl/disconnected/,Disconnected,"I find myself so disconnected while growing up in the millennial generation. I didn't grow up like the rest of everyone around me. 

I had close to no friends in school, everyone had a phone by 6th grade. 
Me? By my first year of high school.
When I grew up. I didn't understand anyone my age.
Alcohol tastes really bad, coffee tastes really bad. I didn't understand parties or hooking up.
I learned from a by gone generation.
No one is traditional anymore.
The only people who understand me are all younger than 13 years old. And older then 40.
At least when I go to the kids tables, we can all agree adults suck, and we should be able to eat candy 24/7.
And no one at the table is obsessed with drinking alcohol. Win win. Those are my bros. 

And being the fool I am, for all I can understand, I understand Nothing and or everything. Understanding and learning about the perspective of others, I can see them as a way of life, but they don't become me, because of so many ways to live life, I can only pick one, and my brain in hardwired already with the mind of a hopeless romantic and a eternal philosopher.
Also known as... A Fool.
Being a expanded mind, full of all these ideas and thoughts, I fit in with no one almost, other philosophers I suppose, or others with deep emotions, love and  thoughts.

My friend Kate, our deep emotions connected us.
Moonlight was the same.
September more our thoughts. She is a philosopher like me.
A logic philosopher, my favorite.
She has all the answers.

I fit in with the kids here and there. We all hate adults. And they aren't in a rush to grow up, or so I tell them not to be.

When I go to work in the morning. Almost everyone is on there phones.
It's interesting to see. And I'm the only one looking around or out the window.
Is everyone but me addicted?
Well no.
It's an efficient use of time. To talk with friends, listen to music, or a podcast. Check on Friends or what not. but it is interesting to see.

I'm disconnected from many things.
I don't understand all the fighting in todays age. Can't we all sit down and talk like adults or something.
I'm to tired to yell. So I won't, but I stay away from all the infighting.
Be kind to everyone, that's the rule. 

I was disconnected from my heart for the longest time. 
That sucker would make all the decisions without me. Falling in love left and right.

Disconnected from time.
Sometimes days feel like seconds.
And years feel like days.
And few are the strangest moments that feel like an eternity.

I'm disconnected from my family.
My friends mean more to me.
As much as I love my family. They are second to my friends.

I'm disconnected from the sky above me.
My feet never leave the earth. The sky always towards to unreachable heavens.
I feel like I was once connected to the sky.
That bright baby blue feels apart of me.

And at times I even feel disconnected from the world. And something or someone calls to me from the other side.
Whispering to me to come home.

But right now. I'm connected to you.
The words you read are the same words I have written. All the words you have read so have I. We are disconnected and connected all the time. We've breathed the same air, we've looked at the same sky, the same moon. The same sun has shined on us. And we are both using the same site.
Connections everywhere.

Connections are a sad thing to think about.
If you can be connected, you can be separated. 
We might hold a dear friend or love in our arms. So it means that one day we will have to let go.

1hauutx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Real_Button_2421/comments/1hauutx/uncertainty_turns_to_passion_part_1/,Uncertainty Turns to Passion Part 1,"The first time I saw Liam, he was standing by the coffee machine in the campus library, his dark hair falling slightly over his forehead as he stirred a cup of black coffee. My heart skipped a beat, and I quickly looked away, pretending to be engrossed in the textbook I wasn't even reading. It wasn’t the first time I had noticed him—no, that would be an understatement. He was one of those people who seemed to radiate confidence without even trying, a quality that both intimidated and intrigued me.

That day, I decided I would do something about it. Something bold. Something I wasn’t entirely sure I was capable of.

I spent the next week rehearsing what I would say to him. In my dorm room, alone with only the sound of my own breath and the occasional creak of the building settling, I practiced. “Hey, Liam,” I would start, my voice wavering despite the empty space around me. “I was wondering if you’d like to hang out sometime? Maybe watch a movie or something?” The words felt foreign on my tongue, like they didn’t belong to me. But I couldn’t back out now. Not after countless nights of imagining what it would be like to actually talk to him, to see if the chemistry I felt from afar was real.

The opportunity presented itself on a Friday evening, just as the sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. I spotted him walking across the quad, his hands stuffed casually into the pockets of his jeans, a slight grin on his face as if he knew something the rest of us didn’t. My stomach twisted into knots, but I forced myself to move toward him, my legs trembling beneath me.

“Hi, Liam,” I managed to say, my voice steady despite the hurricane raging inside me.

He turned, his eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, I was frozen, unsure if I had truly spoken out loud. But then he smiled, a genuine, easy smile that made my chest tighten.

“Hey, Avery, right?” His voice was warm, low, and instantly comforting. I nodded, relieved that he remembered my name.

“Yeah, that’s me.” I laughed nervously, then took a deep breath. “I was wondering... would you maybe want to hang out tonight? Watch a movie or something?”

His smile widened, and for a second, I thought he might say no. But then he said, “Sure, that sounds great. Where should we meet?”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding. “My place? I’ve got some snacks and... uh, a bunch of movies.”

“Perfect. I’ll see you there at eight?”

“Eight,” I repeated, nodding. And just like that, it was set.

\---

The clock struck eight, and I was a bundle of nerves. My apartment was clean, the snacks arranged neatly on the coffee table, and the stack of movies I had painstakingly chosen sat beside the TV. I had changed my outfit three times, finally settling on a soft gray sweater that hugged my curves just enough and a pair of leggings that made me feel comfortable yet put-together.

When the doorbell rang, my heart leapt into my throat. I smoothed down my hair one last time before answering the door. There he was, looking even better than I remembered, in a simple white T-shirt and jeans that accentuated his broad shoulders and long legs.

“Hey,” he said, his voice sending shivers down my spine.

“Hi,” I replied, managing a small smile. “Come on in.”

We settled onto the couch, the distance between us small but still enough to make me hyperaware of his presence. He chose a movie—a romantic comedy that I wouldn’t have picked but secretly loved—and we started watching. The tension between us was palpable, although neither of us mentioned it. Every time our arms brushed against each other, I felt a jolt of electricity, and I could tell he felt it too by the way his gaze lingered on me a little longer than necessary.

As the movie played on, I found myself leaning closer to him, not just because I wanted to hear better but because I wanted to be near him. He smelled amazing, like cedarwood and something sweet, like vanilla. It was intoxicating.

“You okay?” he asked quietly, his voice breaking through my thoughts.

“Yeah,” I murmured, glancing at him. His eyes were on me, intense and curious, and I felt a sudden rush of heat flood my cheeks. “Why do you ask?”

“You seem... distracted,” he said, his lips curving into a smirk.

I laughed softly, shaking my head. “No, I’m good. Just... enjoying the movie.”

He chuckled, the sound low and smooth, and then shifted closer to me. “Good. Me too.”

I swallowed hard, my heart pounding as his arm brushed against mine again. This time, instead of pulling away, I let it linger, savoring the warmth of his skin against mine. He noticed, of course, and his eyes flickered down to where our arms touched before meeting my gaze again.

“Avery,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. The sound of my name on his lips sent a shiver down my spine. He leaned in closer, his breath warm against my ear. “Can I kiss you?”

I froze, my mind racing with a million thoughts. Yes, I wanted this. More than anything. But what if I messed it up? What if he didn’t feel the same way once he got to know me better? My hesitation must have shown on my face because he pulled back slightly, his expression softening.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to,” he said gently. “I don’t want to push you into anything.”

But I did want to. I wanted to so badly that it hurt. “No,” I whispered, shaking my head. “I do. I just... I’ve never done this before.”

His eyes softened, and he gave me a small, reassuring smile. “Neither have I.”

Before I could question him further, he closed the distance between us, his lips pressing gently against mine. It was everything I had imagined and more—his touch was soft but firm, his lips moving in sync with mine as if we had been doing this for years. I melted into him, my hands finding their way to his chest as I held onto him for dear life.

When he pulled away, I was breathless, my heart hammering in my chest. His eyes were dark with desire, and I could see the same uncertainty reflected in them. But there was also passion, a spark that lit up the room and made my body hum with anticipation.

“Avery,” he murmured, his voice hoarse. “Can I touch you?”

I nodded, unable to form words as he reached for me, his hand sliding up my thigh, sending waves of heat through me. He hesitated, his fingers brushing against the edge of my leggings before pausing. “Is this okay?” he asked, his voice trembling slightly.

“Yes,” I breathed, my body aching for more. He slid his hand higher, his fingertips tracing the sensitive skin along my inner thigh, making me gasp. Then, ever so slowly, he moved his hand upward until his palm cupped my breast, his touch tentative but firm.

A moan escaped my lips, and I arched into his hand, desperate for more. He pressed himself against me, his hardness pressing against my core, and I could feel the undeniable heat pooling between my legs.

“Liam,” I whispered, my voice breaking as he began to move against me, his thrusts slow and deliberate, driving me wild with need.",1,1733809184.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

I giggled in surprise and, more girlishly than ever, squealed, “Sir! What are you doing?”

I was surprised, startled, and delighted all at once as he effortlessly cavemanned me toward yet another unknown.

As one would expect, he didn’t answer my question and just carried me into his room, firmly but gently placing me in the middle of his bed.

As I lay there, helpless and hopelessly mesmerized by the moment—the image of him standing over me, looking deliciously powerful—I was ready to do whatever he desired.

He just looked at me with that desire and authority I was growing to enjoy so much. I lay there, waiting for his command and willing to carry it out to a T—or rather, the whole alphabet.

He looked at me once more and, with a look of extreme desire, said while nodding hurriedly, “Red, you’ve got your safe word?”

I acknowledged his nod by nodding and said, “Yes, Sir.”

What happened next came completely out of left field.

He grabbed my legs, lifted them, and put them up before burrowing his face in my… you know.

And… HO…LY… SHHHHHHIIIITTTTT!!

My eyes got BIG, I dry-gasped, and an immediate sensation hit me that I didn’t know was possible for me to feel. It was like my body short-circuited—a rush of sensations, everything in me screaming, “What the hell is this?!” in the best possible way.

My legs tried to close, but he held them open, and his grip only made it better.

I couldn’t decide if I wanted to scream, cry, or laugh hysterically—maybe all three at the same time. My hands went directly to cover my mouth to stop myself from screaming for my life.

All I could think was, “How have I been alive for soooo long and never known this was even a thing?”

I felt like he was installing a whole new, upgraded operating system.

I thought a vibrator was good… Pffft! Vibrators are for rookies! Holy fuck!

For a moment, I thought I could stay there forever, but then it hit me—it was going to be impossible.

The inevitable was coming, fast, and panic set in. What if I went over the edge without his permission? He wouldn’t have that, and I needed it.

I wildly said, “DENALI! DENALI! DENALI!” desperate to stop myself.

Gabriel released the lock he had on my legs, immediately pulled back, moved his hands to cradle my face, and asked, “Beautiful, are you okay?”

Still catching my breath, I stammered, “Sir, I’m GREAT… but… how am I going to know when to cum? How are you going to tell me when it’s okay to cum if your mouth is… you know… there?”

My voice cracked a little at the end… I needed him to tell me—his words, his authority, giving me permission. Without it, something would be missing.

The concern on his face was quickly replaced by a tender, loving smile as he said, “Red, you are such a good girl. I will let you know when you can cum. You just hold it until I tell you.”

Then he kissed me while his hand started teasing my clit, and just like that, my concern was gone, replaced with curiosity.

I didn’t know how it was all going to work, but I was going to do my damnedest to do my part—and I was eager to get back to what was happening.

He whispered, “Are you okay?”

I nodded while saying, “Yes, Sir.”

With a smile, he said, “Good. You stay up here; I’ll be back.”

I smiled as he started slowly trailing kisses down my neck, my breasts, my belly, and finally back to my clit, leaving one hand behind to tease and squeeze my nipples.

As he tongue-tamed my clit, doing some heavenly shit, I noticed something—the raw, caveman-like intensity with which he was doing it before was gone and transformed into this gentle, caring, and thoughtful man.

Don’t get me wrong, it was still amazing, but it was different.

Before I knew it, his face was very much burrowed in my pussy again, and both his hands were playing with my nipples.

All those feelings I had before came rushing back. Heat radiated again from my clit to the rest of my body and melded with the sensations radiating from my nipples, filling a pool of something indescribable in my belly.

The sensations started to overwhelm me, building in waves that felt like they were crashing into every part of me at once.

Gabriel’s tongue moved in magically perfect circles, teasing and pressing just enough to make my clit feel like it was pulsing and glowing.

His hands squeezed my nipples, pulling and rolling them gently, sending jolts of pleasure straight down to where his mouth was working its magic.

It was like every nerve in my body had joined forces, creating this melody of sensations that was both too much and not nearly enough.

I couldn’t stay still—my hips moved on their own, desperate to meet his tongue, to chase that indescribable feeling growing stronger with every second.

I can still feel it now as I write this, deep in my belly—that unrelenting pull.

My breathing messy, like I couldn’t catch enough air.

I whimpered a faint “Use me, Sir,” barely recognizing my own voice.

My legs instinctively wanted to curl around him, but his hands held me firmly in place, leaving me completely open and exposed.

The way he hummed softly, as if savoring the moment as much as I did, sent my mind reeling.

My hands gripped the sheets tightly, searching for something—anything—to steady me as the tension built, becoming almost unbearable.

Every possible good feeling coursed through my body. My toes curled, my back arched, and just as I felt like I might lose control, I heard his voice—steady, commanding, and everything I needed.

“Red, cum now.”

And that was it.

Everything fell apart. I came, getting lost in a rush of pleasure so intense I forgot everything.

And there I was again, breathless and wondering just what had just happened to me.

His head was still between my legs, and every so often, he’d flick my clit with his tongue, making me jump. I was so sensitive at that moment… It was like I wanted him to stop, and before I could react, it was over.

All I know is that during the whole experience, I made a lot of noises and said things I never thought I’d say out loud—things that made me cringe just thinking about them.

At that moment, though, I didn’t care.

I could only hope he’d miraculously gone deaf for just a second or two.

I felt him slide next to me, but it wasn’t enough for him to completely dismantle me—he still had to get my smell along the way. I felt his nose close to me and heard him taking it in… I loved it.

When he got back to where I was, he said, “You’re okay over here? Had a nice little orgasm, did you? Did you enjoy it?” mocking me for what I said earlier at the table.

Still trying to catch my breath, I said, “Yes, Sir, thank you. I am mildly sure that I am going to REALLY love Saturdays.”

He smiled, kissed my forehead, and said, “Have I told you how much I enjoy your wit?”

I said, “No, but I’ve gotten hints here and there.”

He just smiled and kept tracing lines between my chest and my belly button.

Then he said, “When you’ve recovered, go to the kitchen and get us two glasses of water. We’ve got some exploring to do.”

I quickly bounced off the bed and rushed to the kitchen to get some water—partly because we were both obviously thirsty, but also because I felt that familiar drowsy feeling I got after an intense Gabriel-gasm. And I was not going to go to sleep again… well, I could go for a nap, but not until I got my girlfriend-did-her-job badge, you know?

I came back with the water, took a big drink, and cheekily asked, “Sir, do you need anything else before we explore?”

I know it sounds like I was Ms. Confidence, but my heart was jumping out of my chest. It was more anticipation than embarrassment or shame… after all the nasty shit I said during my last orgasm, shame pretty much got defenestrated—and YES, I will continue to use that word.

While opening his right arm for me to join him, he replied, “No, beautiful. I just need you to come here, next to me.”

I happily jumped on the bed, slid right next to him, and burrowed myself into his side.

Being there, under his wing, so to speak, I felt good, protected, and like I belonged. I never knew such a small thing could mean so much and feel so good.

His presence was a constant highlighter of so many things I didn’t think I needed in my life, but apparently, I did.

Anyway, back to the topic at hand. While lying so deeply beside him, my face turned to his side and my hand on his chest, I gingerly hinted at my readiness to get things going by saying, “So, what do I do now?”

I couldn’t see him, but I knew he smiled by the way his breathing changed and asked, “Do about what, beautiful?”

I said, “You know! Don’t make me say it!”

He let out an audible exhale and smiled, then said, “Beautiful, I know you would like for me to guide you right now, and I can understand more than you would think… unfortunately, that directly interferes with my desire to see your creativity and curiosity at work. So, you can take it from here. But don’t feel pressured. If you decide that you’re not ready, it’s okay… there’s no rush. There’s always the DVDs.”

Oh no, my good Sir, I will not be demoted to DVD watching! If there is a DVD, it better be instructional. I took a deep breath and told myself, “Okay, Red, don’t be a wuss. This is what you wanted… so do it!”

I swiftly got up, got on top of him, and said, “Okay, Sir, what is your safe word?”

He gave me an endearing look, smiled, grabbed my face, and said, “Red, you are so adorable, and such a good girl.

Yes, generally, this is how you would handle it, and I am so proud of you for doing it. But if we ever get to the point where I will need a safe word while we do this, there has been some cosmic shift in the universe… but you are doing fantastic.”

After saying that, he instructed me to lift myself a bit while he removed his shirt, laid back, and pulled me to him so I could kiss him.

That kiss alone was all I needed to start gaining some confidence and get myself into that mode. It was amazing how he always knew what I needed before I even began to understand it.

Anyway, our kiss quickly turned into a make-out session, and I could feel his penis getting hard against me as I straddled him and dry rode him while he kept teasing my skin with his nails.

I almost fell for it. I found myself falling for the habit of just feeling whatever he was doing—and then he’d do whatever Gabriel-ish thing he did to make me want to give myself to him.

But this time, I was the one who was supposed to do stuff.

I quickly snapped myself out of it and started working my way down from his face, kissing his chest, his belly—each kiss bringing me closer. As I moved down, I could feel it coming up past my belly, past my boobs, until I was face to face with his waistband. My heart was pounding out of my chest so much I could’ve probably given him a heart-job because it was beating so hard.

I could feel the heat coming from it, and I could see a trail of my own wetness on him… a Red trail, if you will.

I was nervous but full of anticipation about meeting him for the first time. I just stuck my fingers under the waistband, pulled, and there it was…

It was… intimidating and fascinating all at once. I’d seen my share of pictures and read descriptions. But this was not just some random internet dick—this was Gabriel’s dick, and it was there for me for the first time. It was something else entirely.

It was just lying there with its head pointing toward Gabriel. It wasn’t enormous, but it was thicker and longer than I expected. I mean, I didn’t know what to expect, but I guess I had some idea. I kept staring at it, the way it looked alive, pulsing slightly, like it had a heartbeat of its own.

Then I ran my fingers on it. The skin was soft, but there was a hardness that made it feel weird in a good way. I found myself just staring—a mix of curiosity and nervousness washing over me as I tried to wrap my head around the fact that this was real—and that I was about to touch it in ways I never imagined or even thought I’d desire.

Without even thinking about it, I finished pulling Gabriel’s pants off. And believe it or not, Gabriel had now faded into the background. I was entranced and silently developing my own relationship with him… What’s your name, Sir?

I kept running my fingers on it, tracing the veins that traveled around it. Then I wrapped my hand around, and it felt soft but hard at the same time. It felt heavy. I never thought heaviness was a factor, but it felt heavy.

Then I pulled the skin back, revealing a wet, shiny head that was thicker than the rest of it. I did that slowly a few times. It was so fascinating in my hand, but visually, it was like a weird little game of peek-a-boo we were playing.

Without thinking, and following Gabriel’s example (I wanted to know what the whole smelling fuss was about), I put my nose on it and smelled along the shaft to see what it smelled like up close. But when I got to the head, I ended up with a bit of wetness on the tip of my nose. It was funny, and I said to Gabriel, “Well, that’s one way to mark your territory.”

He cracked up, but I didn’t have time to admire my comedic genius—I was dicksploring.

Without breaking “eye contact” with Mini-Sir, I asked Gabriel, “Why is it wet? Is it always wet?”

He smiled and said, “No, beautiful, that’s precum.”

I quietly pulled the skin as far back as it went and asked, “Does that hurt?”

He said, “No, it’s okay.” And as he said that, a drop of clear liquid started coming out of it.

I asked, “Is that precum coming out?”

And he said, “Yes, beautiful.”

Without thinking, I just thought, “Fuck it!” and licked it off. Might as well, right? Gabriel just smiled while quietly observing me.

The taste was surprisingly sweet-ish. I mean, I wouldn’t add it to my coffee for sweetness, but it wasn’t bad—definitely not as salty or bleachy as I had read. It wouldn’t take long to get used to it, and if it was an acquired taste, consider it acquired.

Without looking at Gabriel, I asked, “Sir, do you mind me just looking at it?”

He responded, “No, beautiful. I am enjoying your exploring a lot more than you, trust me.”

Since I got the okay from the boss to keep exploring, I just flipped it back and pointed it at Gabriel, and started looking at his balls.

They weren’t as fascinating as Mini-Sir, but they had their own thing going on with closely trimmed hair that gave it a tidy, but still natural, look. I didn’t love them, but I didn’t hate them either. They were just there, completing the picture and doing whatever it is balls do.

That was until I got it in my head to lick them. What can I say? I was curious! And when I did, I heard Gabriel grunt quietly and thought, “Ohh! My Sir likes that!”

I decided I should remember it—it was bound to come in handy later.

Alright, enough sightseeing—it was time to do it.

I wasn’t nervous or anxious anymore—I knew the terrain. If anything, I was a little intimidated. I was certain that, at some level, I was going to be compared to Chrissie, and she was probably a master at this. But my Sir had said a few times that he was confident in my curiosity and learning capabilities, and I was not going to let him down.

In a last-minute effort to make it as good as possible for him, I decided to be vulnerable-ish and gingerly asked, “Sir, before I give the head-debut of a lifetime, is there anything you like that you want me to do, or something I shouldn’t do?”

He just said, “No, beautiful, just be yourself. And if you’re on the verge of something I don’t approve of, I will let you know. Remember that this is an act of your self-expression. I just need you to get comfortable, play around, and find what you like. That’s all.”

I said, “Okaaaaay,” and looked back down at Mini-Sir, who was winking at me.

The first five or ten minutes, I just explored and played around while Gabriel just looked, smiling in approval. I started tentatively, my hand still exploring Mini-Sir.

As I leaned in, I opened wide and let the head enter for the first time. I paused immediately, unsure if I was doing it right, and glanced up at Gabriel, hoping for some sign. His eyes were glued to me, his breathing steady, and a smile that gave me enough courage to continue.

My tongue decided to come out to play, hesitantly tracing the edge of the head. It felt strange but not unpleasant, and I thought, “Okay, I guess this is fine?”

My exploration was interrupted by Gabriel, who said, “Red, do that again with your tongue.”

I said, “What? This?” and ran my tongue around the head again.

He said, “Red, stick your tongue out for me,” and I did.

As if in shock, he said, “Red, you have the sexiest tongue I’ve ever seen.”

What? That’s a thing? I asked, “What? Why?”

And he just said, “Don’t worry, I will explain later, I promise. I am just one lucky man… carry on, beautiful.”

I replied, “Alright, but I am curious now and will want to know…” and got back to business.

I put my mouth on him, not too far at first, just enough to get used to the sensation. My tongue moved experimentally, tracing the veins that I’d noticed earlier. I wasn’t sure what I was doing, but Gabriel’s soft exhale reassured me that I wasn’t totally off-track. My movements were clumsy, my hand following as I tried to find a rhythm. I wasn’t exactly confident, but I was determined—and that counted for something, right?

At one point, I remembered how much he’d liked it when I licked his balls. Carefully stroking him with one hand as I moved my mouth lower, I pressed a tentative kiss to his balls, unsure if I was doing it right. When I heard a low grunt escape him, my nervousness eased.

I licked one side, then the other, savoring the warmth and faint muskiness, and let myself feel a tiny rush of pride, thinking, “He REALLY likes that.”

As I moved back to Mini-Sir, I realized I’d accidentally let too much saliva linger and had to pause to wipe my mouth, laughing softly at myself. Gabriel chuckled quietly, his hand brushing my cheek, and that small gesture steadied me.

When I returned to focus, I started to find a tiny bit of rhythm, my lips and tongue moving in ways that felt a little more natural. I still felt awkward—like I was trying too hard to mimic what I’d read or seen—but every time Gabriel let out a soft sound, it made me think that I was doing okay.

Then some questions started coming to my head like, “Is he enjoying it?”, “Am I doing it right?” and the god-awful, “He’s probably just pretending to enjoy it so I won’t feel bad.”

That made me feel even more clumsy and self-conscious, like it was super obvious that I didn’t know what I was doing. Those thoughts and their importance started growing in my head, and I started to lose focus. I even thought about asking Gabriel if he wanted to finish himself and just put this whole facade behind us, you know? I mean, Chrissie would’ve probably finished the whole thing off by now. He was probably thinking the whole thing was a waste of time and he should’ve put on the DVD.

I decided to say, “Sir, are you sure this is okay? It’s okay if it isn’t, you can tell me. I won’t feel bad if you want me to stop and do something else.” —I know, I was so full of shit, but at the time I meant it.

Gabriel sat up, looked at me, and said, “Red, you’re doing very well, but I’m going to assume that you think you’re not. Am I right?”

I just nodded, and he said, “Red, you’re inside your head. Stop thinking or assuming that I’m not enjoying what we’re doing. The more you let those thoughts take over, the more they will.”

I said, “I just feel like I suck at this, and not in the way that you would like, you know? It’s not like you’re screaming and grabbing sheets like I was when you did it to me…”

He laughed a little at that and said, “Beautiful, we experience things differently. But unless you’re telling me that you don’t want to do this, we will sit here and finish this. Are you telling me that you don’t want to do this?”

I said, “No, I do want to do it. I just feel like I’m not good at it.”

He grabbed my chin and said, “So, we will sit here and practice until you get good at it. Remember, you started this—you wanted this. The only question that matters is: why did you want to do it?”

I said, “I don’t know… I guess because I wanted you to feel good, like you make me feel.”

He replied, “So you’re saying that you don’t want me to feel good anymore?”

I said, “No! That’s not what I mean.”

He replied, “So instead of letting bad thoughts distract you from your goal, keep your goal in mind. Think about the reason you’re doing it.

I’m willing to sacrifice myself for the greater good and let you give me head for the rest of the night, if that’s what it takes.” And we both laughed.

He continued, “Remember when we first started dating, I told you that if you applied your intentionality, things would become enjoyable?” I nodded, and he continued, “Well, that’s exactly what I meant. If you do things with the intention as the guiding force, everything—and I mean everything—will be easier and better. The more intention you put into things, the more intense and joyful things will be, for both of us.

When I ate you out, my mind was completely focused on my intention, not on the mechanics of what I was doing or worrying about what you were thinking. I just focused on my intention, which was to make you mine and make sure you knew there is only one man for you… me.”

I blushed and felt so wanted, and when he ate me out, it did feel that way, like there is only one man for me.

I smiled and said, “So, I should do it like I am the only woman for you?”

He replied, “Whatever you feel will work, do that— as much of it as you can. Just remember that the physical act does not guide the intent; the intent guides the physical act. Understand?”

I said, “Yes, Sir.”

He said, “Good,” grabbed my chin, and guided my lips to his, and we kissed.

I thought, “Okay, time to get back to it.” I literally got it in my mind that I was the only woman for him—temporarily, at least.

I started slowly, and then I remembered him once saying he liked that I generated a lot of saliva, so I stopped holding back, letting it flow freely. It was messy, and I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing, but Gabriel’s soft groans reassured me that he didn’t mind. I shifted slightly, angling myself to take him a little deeper, but when I gagged slightly, I pulled back quickly, laughing nervously, whispering, “Sorry!” He only smiled and gently brushed my hair back, his eyes soft with reassurance.

As he saw me gain a little confidence, Gabriel leaned forward and cupped my ears tightly. This brought my experience to a new level—the sudden muffled quiet startled me, but then I became acutely aware of the slick, rhythmic sound of my movements. It was oddly intimate, hearing every small detail of the lubricated friction as I moved. I felt his hands in my hair, steadying me as I continued, my tongue swirling and my hand stroking. I didn’t feel smooth or skillful—far from it—but I kept going, trying different things and noting what made him react the most. I kept paying close attention to every low moan or sharp exhale; they spurred me on and encouraged me to keep going despite the fact that I had no clue what I was doing.

Gabriel noticed my shift quickly when I found my rhythm and pretty much moved on from exploring to pleasing him. The look of gentle guide turned into my Sir, supervising my work and receiving the pleasure I had promised him earlier.

Something told me that an instruction was coming, and I continued to suck as I waited for it. It was so weird—it was like his eyes told me that the training wheels were coming off, but he didn’t need to say a word. I just knew.

Shortly after that, he said, “Red, don’t stop what you’re doing. Get on your knees, arch your back, and stick your ass out for me.”

I clumsily kept sucking him and found a way to get my knees under me, lifting my ass for his pleasure. I remember thinking, “JFC! My Sir is all about the ass! Well, if my ass is what my Sir wants, my ass Sir shall get.” I raised my ass like a flag at dawn and wiggled it while making eye contact, which got me a nice little dick-pulse on my tongue—well played, if I say so myself.

In between quiet grunts, he said, “You’re doing great, beautiful. It’s as if you were made just for me.” And THAT FELT GOOD. The mixture of my ass feeling open and exposed while he looked at me sucking his dick and telling me how I was made for him was incredible.

Then he sat up a bit and started grabbing my breasts, playing with my nipples, and ho-ly-shhhh-it!! He just kept making it better. It almost felt like I was the one getting the blowjob… fuck!! I remember thinking, “Why are people complaining about giving their boyfriends head?? This is gooood!”

Gabriel kept talking to me, telling me how he couldn’t wait to fuck my wet pussy while I was bent over the way I was at that moment. It made me feel like he was literally fucking me while I was there with his dick in my mouth. It was as if I was literally sucking pleasure out of his dick and taking it for myself.

Just when I thought his words couldn’t hit harder, he said, “You are such a good girl. I can’t wait to fuck you while I play with your ass.”

A wave of heat shot through me, and without thinking, I instantly tightened the suctional hold I had on his dick, which made it pulse in my mouth. It seemed like every time he acknowledged any part of me, it would come alive and make me react. Apparently, my enjoyment of “the butt thing” wasn’t exactly a well-kept secret.

Gabriel then told me to remain as I was while he got on his knees and put his dick back in my face… and there it was, that enormous figure I wanted to serve. I felt tiny in front of this large presence. It felt so powerful, and I was more than willing to continue sucking him in. He put his hands on my head and traced a path toward my butt, grabbing and stretching it, and then… a hard spank! It took everything from me not to gasp with his dick in my mouth, but I managed.

Then he stood up and pulled me so I was on my knees. I could tell something was about to happen. Was I doing it? Was he about to cum? There must’ve been some dick-sucking entity hiding inside me because I let myself go—I went crazy. Sucking, licking, and doing whatever else came to mind. At one point, my jaw got tired, and I switched to jerking him with my hand—but don’t worry, I had put so much spit on it, it’s probably still wet today. I alternated between stroking him and sucking the head sporadically, and each time, I was rewarded by his heavy breathing. I was excited. I was doing it!

I know I said I didn’t have a problem with swallowing his cum, but I also wanted to look—and he did say I should be myself, and myself is a curious little thing. I decided to suck the head until something happened, and when it did, I planned to pull back and watch.

I know, I know… I didn’t think it through, but I was too busy to plan ahead. Anyway, Gabriel did not disappoint! Shot after shot of cum kept coming out of his dick, and I was entranced. The first shot landed dead on my cheek, a little landed on my face, some on my shoulder, but most of it ended up on my chest… it was everywhere. It was like a cummy Fourth of July celebration. When the show was coming to an end, my excitement was too much, and I couldn’t help blurting out, “Do more! Do more! Do more!” which caused him to collapse on his bed laughing hysterically and cumming at the same time.

So, even thought my curiosity did me in again and got me an accidental “money shot”, or cumshot, I felt proud that I had completed my first blowjob, which lasted close to an hour and ended in a puddly, cummy mess. Still, I was happy to report that I had officially earned my girlfriend-did-her-job badge. 

My crowning jewel? A collapsed, laughing and cumming boyfriend.

I (22 F) met my best friend (21 M) in high school and we immediately clicked. We didn’t have too, too much in common other than the ways we talked and expressed ourselves and the way we saw the world. 

It was like a meeting of two minds and souls, we both expressed how we’d never met anyone like the other. We’d have hang outs at the nearest park or skip school and slack off at the nearest gas station, maybe buy tacos and whatever we wanted. We’d banter and bicker over shows and pop culture. Maybe vent about our dysfunctional families and how fucked things were while smoking the world’s tiniest blunt. We simply felt free and open with each other. 

It was a special bond between us, we were growing up and we knew we had some sort of feelings for each other but we never got together because of our circumstances. 

I wanted to give my partner the absolute best to them, I wanted to give the best version of myself, the best I could possibly do. But my environment and space did not give me the chance to be any of that for him at the time. And he was in the exact same predicament as I was. Neither of us were ready to be together, so we just flowed along as best friends, as gut wrenching and emotional as it was sometimes. 

And them, I found out he was sexually assaulted at around the same time I was when we were both kids… needless to say, it only drove us closer to each other. We were healing each other. Together. It felt like we were made to meet one another and I couldn’t stand to lose him then. 

Long story short, we graduated high school and decided to say our goodbyes. It was a mutual decision but we wanted to leave a good thing good, not watch it deteriorate slowly due to the distance and time zone differences. We’d healed a very wounded part of ourselves together and we came out stronger than when we came in. It was a hard goodbye but we needed it to grow into ourselves in the future. 

We both graduate uni. this year and I’ve never forgotten him, not for a single day. We check up on one another through stalking each other’s social medias but we never speak… I miss him and I want to get to know the man he is today. We’ve changed and I know the circumstances have changed as well. I want my best friend back and I hope he does as well. I plan to ask him after new years if he wants to meet for coffee and catch up. Wish me luck :)

When it comes to outdoor relaxation, a propane fire pit table can elevate your experience to new heights. These versatile pieces of furniture not only provide warmth and ambiance but also add a stylish touch to your patio or backyard.

### Understanding Your Space

Before you make a purchase, take a moment to evaluate your outdoor area. Consider these aspects:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/fire-pit-tables-propane  
  
- **Size:** How much space do you have available? Ensure the table fits comfortably without overcrowding the area.
- **Style:** Is your outdoor decor modern, rustic, or classic? Pick a design that enhances the overall aesthetic of your space.
- **Functionality:** Think about how you plan to use the fire pit. Will it serve as the main seating area for gatherings, or is it more of a decorative piece?

### Choosing the Right Design

Fire pit tables come in various designs, and selecting the right one can significantly impact your outdoor experience. Here are a few styles to consider:

- **Rectangular Tables:** Great for larger gatherings, these tables provide ample space for food, drinks, and seating. They often work well with sectional sofas.

- **Heat Output:** Check the BTU rating of your fire pit. Higher BTU ratings produce more heat, providing warmth on chilly evenings.

- **Easy Access to Propane Tank:** A good design allows for easy access to the propane tank for refilling and maintenance.

### Accessorizing Your Fire Pit Table

To maximize your propane fire pit table's potential, think about accessories that enhance comfort and usability:

- **Cushions and Throws:** Add cozy cushions to your seating area to ensure comfort while socializing around the fire.
- **Fire Glass or Lava Rocks:** These not only improve the aesthetics but also help distribute heat more evenly.
- **Protective Covers:** A weather-resistant cover will keep your fire pit table safe and extend its life.
- **Adjustable Flame Height:** Some fire pits come with adjustable settings that allow you to control the flame height, contributing to the mood and safety.

### Making the Final Decision

Ultimately, choosing the right propane fire pit table involves balancing style, functionality, and safety. Make sure to weigh your options carefully, and don’t hesitate to ask for recommendations or read customer reviews to ensure you’re making an informed decision. Once you find the perfect fire pit table, you’ll create a welcoming atmosphere for gatherings or quiet evenings under the stars.

No noise. No nonsense. No needless drama.

Then one fine day, I thought, “Why not give it a shot myself?”

So here I am, working full-time on an experiment in 'better journalism' (big words, I know!).

And with that, say hello to 'Dot'.

1hauifa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1hauifa/when_is_the_right_time_to_rebrand/,When is the right time to rebrand?,"If you’ve read my previous article on [*When your brand needs a change*If you’ve read my previous article on When your brand needs a change, this one serves as a follow-up.](https://medium.com/@designlabb/when-your-brand-needs-a-change-d0af64d0431e)

Rebranding is not as easy as it seems on paper. It’s actually more than changing a logo or a color palette. Like I said [in the article](https://medium.com/@designlabb/when-your-brand-needs-a-change-d0af64d0431e), rebranding is about developing a new identity and new positioning in the marketplace. Redesigning a logo is simply a *brand revitalization*.

Anyways, when is the right time to take the leap and do a rebrand? The short answer I could give you is almost never. However, there are some triggering factors that may make you decide to do a rebrand.

# 1. Change in business

Maybe you’re merging with another company, entering a new industry, or pivoting to an entirely different business model. If your company isn’t the same as it used to be, your brand shouldn’t be either.

A great example is [Dunkin’](https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/releases-20180925), previously Dunkin’ Donuts. Dunkin’ Donuts rebranded to Dunkin’ in 2018. But it wasn’t just about shortening the name. They wanted to redefine the brand to align with changing consumer preferences and their future vision.

The move signaled a shift from being primarily associated with donuts to becoming a broader lifestyle brand focused on coffee, beverages, and quick-service food.

# 2. Change in product

Sometimes, a new product or service offering can redefine your brand. Take Apple in the late 1990s. What started as a computer company transitioned into a tech lifestyle brand with the launch of products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Their rebranding around innovation and sleek design positioned them as a leader in multiple industries.

Similarly, Netflix began as a DVD rental service but rebranded to focus on streaming, which is now their core offering. That shift required not just operational changes but also a new brand identity to represent their cutting-edge approach.

# 3. Change in market

This is probably the most difficult trigger to pull but not impossible. When markets evolve, staying relevant is critical. Think of Airbnb. In their early days, they marketed themselves as a budget-friendly option for travelers. As the travel industry changed, they rebranded to focus on “belonging” and unique experiences, appealing to a broader, more upscale audience.

Another example is [Burberry](https://row.burberry.com/a-new-identity/). Once perceived as outdated, they rebranded with modern designs, social media-savvy campaigns, and younger ambassadors to appeal to a fresh, global audience while still honoring their heritage.

If you think rebranding is just about looking cool or modern, you’re wrong. It’s about staying relevant, resonating with your audience, and preparing for what’s next. So, before you dive in, make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons — and that you have a clear vision of where you want to go., this one serves as a follow-up.",0,1733807923.0,Design,2,0.4,False

1haugnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1haugnj/nc_with_nparents_but_wanting_to_reconnect_with/,"NC with NParents, but wanting to reconnect with siblings","Using a ✨throwaway✨ so some details will be left out and nonspecific for identity reasons. For reference, I'm trans, 26M.

CW ahead for mentions of physical abuse (I will attempt to keep it as non graphic as possible) and references to suicide/suicide attempts (again, going to keep it non graphic).

Crash course on my life: growing up sucked, as I imagine it did for most people coming here being raised by NParents/Enabling parents. My bio parents divorced when I was young and my mother had primary custody of me, while I'd visit my father on holidays and breaks. Unfortunately my mother passed when I was young and I ended up going to live with my father and his new wife full time. Immediately, I was cut off from my mother's family ""for my own safety"" and that they were no good for my mental health.

 They did not appreciate the way I acted and considered me a sneaky, lying, ungrateful leech of a child and all around ""untamed"" and mentally deficit (I was 11). My parents ran that household like the Navy, ""physically disciplining"" me via belts, spoons, cords, coat hangers, and yelling/arguing at me for hours. Several points I had been driven to nosebleeds due to the amount of stress these discussions would cause, something I didn't even think was a possible physical symptom irl. For years, I had been held to impossible standards, been told I was supposed to be the next Jeff Bezos or Steve Jobs and become something important, and that every mistake and flaw was something that made me impossible and undeserving of love, and respect was something that was earned. My interests in ""dark"" stuff like anime and creepypasta made me evil. It was a privilege to even be in their home. I was only loved ""unconditionally"" in only the sense that it was said and that I was blood related to at least one of them. I was too afraid to reach out for help because of the fear I'd ""destroy"" our family by getting CPS involved and myself + half-siblings getting split up and put into foster care, never to see each other again. Any time anyone asked where my bruises or marks came from, I'd blame our dog pulling me down while walking or some other accident. I would feel a sense of obligation to ""protect"" the family by lying about what was being done to me behind closed doors. This hell would continue until I had an episode at 14 y/o that resulted in my hospitalization and care at a mental hospital for about a month after I had finally been driven to the point of trying to end it all. I was diagnosed with major depression disorder, some flavor of psychosis due to deluding myself about the situation I was in (I was very adamant I was being divinely punished for somehow being related to my mother's death and/or she was secretly alive somewhere and would come save me one day), and anxiety.

My parents changed after that. I was no longer being physically abused any longer besides prodding a finger at my chest or getting in my face when arguing, but the verbal abuse would continue shortly after I returned back into the household. To the end, they blamed my episode on my affinity towards darker media like creepypasta and anime rather than the harm they caused.

Amongst all this hell, a few half-siblings had been born, with a 10 year age gap between myself and the eldest. I adored them and loved them, as did my parents. It became clear that they were being raised much differently than I was, especially as those siblings approached the age I was when I first joined the household, but I held no resentment towards them for it and was happy they received a decently well-rounded childhood. But I could tell I was an outsider/visitor in my own home as I got older; my dad had his new family and I was simply leftovers from a time long gone and dead. This was not helped by me coming out as trans along the way (FtM). Not only was I mentally deficit failure, but now I was now just looking for attention and wanting to be different/make my own life harder/harm myself by taking this path, etc etc. 
Eventually I was kicked out after coming back home for the summer after my first year of college once they found my needles used for HRT that I was prescribed while in college. They didn't want me to be a ""bad influence"" on my siblings. I was sent out into the world with only a handful of belongings, no means of transport besides public, no life experience, and no real job.

 I found support through my godparents on my mother's side after I decided in a last ditch effort to reach out for help before looking for a comfortable edge to jump from. To my surprise, they had been waiting for me to reach out after my dad cut off our ties and they were very quick to take me in and help get me back onto my feet. Finally I felt loved and wanted.

However, I did live in fear of my immediate family finding out that I ""betrayed"" them by seeking help from the ""bad family."" At one point, one of my siblings briefly reached out to me online in secret and revealed how things were going, and that my parents no longer talked about me. But they had known where I was during my time away and that I was with my extended family. During the height of COVID, I received an email asking for my new mailing address from my dad. I never responded as I knew he already knew where I was and was acting dumb to open that door again. That was the last time he's tried to reach out. 

Still, once the nightmares passed, I'd have dreams of having him back in my life, showing him what I've been up to and him being even just a little proud of me for getting where I am in life. I never changed my email or phone number in case he ever did want to try and fix things between us, but he never has since.

Recently, that same sibling reached out again to me, and we're back in contact and no longer talking in secret. I'm currently on vacation in the city they recently moved to. But my dad is also aware that I'm here for vacation. He's expressed to that sibling that we should meet to still see if I ""still care about them as siblings"", and that he's open to me ""explaining myself."" I really don't want to deal with that man right now since based on the phrasing, he doesn't seem to have changed at all in his views towards me, but my siblings are all minors so they'd be accompanied by him or their mom (who I'd want to deal with even less) if we did meet. 

They also were too young to remember the hell I went through behind closed doors. To them, they're nothing but your typical loving parents in their nuclear family. I don't really want them to feel upset or guilty by sharing what I went through since it wasn't their fault and they have had a different growing up experience with them than I did. I did try to lightly explain that I don't want to interact with our father, but they don't quite understand the complexity of our relationship  and suggested I just bring a gift and say sorry to him over coffee lol

However, I don't want them to think that I don't love them anymore by not accepting their invite to meet, but I would just prefer not to trigger a spiral during a time I should be trying to relax. I don't even know what I'd say to them after so long or what sort of explanation my father would want from me. I don't hate him, but I can't say he doesn't feel the same about me.

I've been NC with my parents themselves for about 7 years now aside from that prodding address email. I've done a lot of healing and became rather independent and comfortable in my adult life: good job (did not become Jeff Bezos/Steve Jobs however), stable housing, freely able to travel and do as I please for the most part, enjoy whatever media I so chose (did eventually grow out of creepypasta lol, but still do engage with horror as a fan and creator), transitioned decently, and have found much support from my formerly estranged extended family that I was isolated from by my NParents. A lot of people I've shared with have said my case is nothing short of a success and I'm very well established all things considered. I still suffer from the mental effects from being raised in that environment (no more psychosis, but I do still have MDD, anxiety, and now PTSD) but I've been coping through medication and therapy very well. I do however regret not making an appointment with my therapist before leaving on vacation, I would likely be more prepared for this situation. 

TLDR; Life big poopy stinky with bio Nparent+Nstep parent, but still adore half siblings. NC with NParents, but back in communication with half siblings. Half siblings want to meet up and reconnect in person while I'm in town for vacation. Nparent is aware of me being in town and has been using rather condescending language in regards to meeting up which is not giving me much confidence that this will be a very happy reunion, but don't want to make my siblings feel like I don't love them anymore, BUT ALSO don't want to spiral while vacationing, idk what to do 💀",1,1733807751.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I’m 24M and recently matched with a girl 24F who I was instantly attracted to on hinge. I’ve been using dating apps for a while now and have been on a few dates (hooked up with 2) and just met a few over coffee, but this one felt different because I seemed to be very physically attracted to her. We started talking and then I got her number and we were texting for some time and met 2 weeks after for our first date which I thought went really well because we spent around 4 hours together. We would talk a lot about qualities and values we’d find in a partner and etc etc, never really asked her directly what she’s looking for but the vibe she gave was that she wants something serious and just by seeing her and speaking to her I was willing to get serious with her.

After our date before leaving she mentioned she’s going to let me know about a 2nd date and that she needs time to let these things sit and process which I found odd. She went home that night and texted me thank you and texted a little more until she said goodnight. I decided not to say anything until she reached back with a clear decisive answer on if she wants to continue with moving things forward with another date and etc but after an entire day goes by she messages me asking hey how’s it going and when I responded she sounded off on how she felt upset and it rubbed her the wrong way that I didn’t say anything for a full day when even though I expressed interest in seeing her and that her speaking as usual would indicate continued interest. Stupid me, I took this as a hint that she’s pretty into me and we kept talking for another week on text and call and even scheduled a 2nd date and she would open up a lot about personal issues going on in her life and etc until she went on a girls trip a couple hours to another city. During the weekend and on this trip she was texting perfectly fine as she always does. Then out of the blue on Monday morning she sent me a message saying she realizes her feelings for me haven’t developed at this stage as she’d hope and that she hopes I can follow through with my other plans on the day we were going to meet again and that I didn’t do anything wrong in particular but that she’s firm on this decision. I told her I wish her the best and left it at that and we haven’t talked since. Now there are a couple details I’m leaving out of this due to anonymity and relevance but would love to get an idea from y’all on whether if I did something wrong or what could cause this abrupt end. I’ve spoken to friends and family about this and have seen other posts on Reddit where this is fairly common but thought I’d put my own experience on here since it’s a bit unique and get people’s perspective on it. It’s honestly been pretty heartbreaking as I thought it was worth emotionally investing into since we had a lot of similarities such as cultural, ethnic and values wise and all but I don’t know.",1,1733807388.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

So... idk man.

I (28) had been with my fiancé (Alex 34) since 2020. We met at a friend’s party, hit it off, and have/had been together ever since.

He finished his Doctorate in Economics just last year. Since then he has been working at the Uni. I have my Master’s in Media Sciences and decided to start working instead of going for a PhD.

Okay... so the problem is that Alex broke up with me last Monday. It was literally so surreal and honestly... just weird.

For the past few months, he’d been acting strange. He was making demands and then dropping them immediately. A few examples: he told me we were going to paint our walls back from dark green to white. When I asked why, he just said, ""For fuck's sake, forget it,"" and never brought it up again, even when I asked.

Another time, he came home and got mad because I was sitting on the couch with my head covered in a blanket (I had cramps). He was upset because I was “just sitting there watching Netflix” (mind you, the house was spotless). When I tried to talk about it, he said, “Forget it, it’s not a big deal.”

This kind of thing became common. Every time I tried to communicate... tried to figure out what was going on, whether it was something I did or maybe he was just stressed at work... he would just say everything was fine, but he was clearly seething with rage. I didn’t even have to do anything; he would find something to complain about (the apartment, clothes, me, work, etc.).

So, I gave him space, which apparently was also wrong. I told him I was going to help my parents with repairs for a few days, and somehow that was also wrong because he wanted to renovate the apartment too.

Then, on Monday, I got a text saying we needed to talk. I knew what was coming, and after the last few months, I had made peace with it.

When I came home, he was sitting on the couch. He didn’t even wait for me to take off my jacket before saying, ""I want to break up."" Then the verbal diarrhea started.

He told me he resented me. First, because I didn’t pursue my academic career further, even though I was capable, and he didn’t want to upset me at the time. Then, when I started making more money (since he didn’t make much as a PhD student), he felt like I should have the last word financially, and he hated it.

Mind you, I never said anything like “it’s my money, so I have the final say.” That’s a rule he imposed on himself, and he hated it.

He said he hated our paint scheme, the couch, and even our fucking crockpot.

Then, he told me he had rejected a better PhD program to stay here because I had already started my job by the time he got the acceptance letters. Only, he never told me he had even applied overseas. He said a few months ago he checked in with a friend who’s in that program, saw how they were thriving, and decided I ruined his life. He said I had too much control over his life and that he hated the idea that I could just decide not to pay for things and “fuck him over” (I honestly don’t even know what that means).

He also said he hated that all his friends loved me and didn’t let him vent about me.

Then he said again, “I’m done.”

I was floored. I had already made peace with the idea that we were ending, and it hurt, but after that rant, I was just disgusted. I looked at him, probably with a disgusted expression, and said, ""Okay.""

He lost it. He said this is exactly what he meant... that it was horrible. We had been together for four years, and all I had to say was “okay” to our breakup?

I just asked if he wanted to stay here while he figured out where to go. He said, “Typical, of course you’re holding the apartment over me,” and started ranting again, so I just left.

I told my parents, and they’re also confused. My dad suggested I reach out to our landlord and explain the situation to see what options I have. I can keep paying the rent no problem myself. He covered the utilities and some subscriptions.

Just to reiterate, I never had a problem with this. I saw that he was chasing his dream, and that was more important to me than a 50/50 financial split. I make good money and am happy at my job. I never saw it as “slaving away.” I always had the mentality that my money was our money because we were building a life together. Of course, I had my own savings and fun money, but I honestly never cared. As long as I felt he was working towards something and wasn’t taking advantage of me, I was fine with it. More than fine.

Alex is still mad. He’s going between texting me like a robot about the logistics of the split to being a seething asshole complaining about everything. I’m not even hurt anymore. I just feel nauseated by him at this point.

I don’t know. Should I have reacted differently?

Edit: Thank you for all your opinions! It was nice to get this off my chest, lol.

Just to clarify, tho. I don't feel like a victim. I feel like something happened, and my relationship just turned bad. He behaved like an asshole but that is the extent of it. Very clearly, something is going on. But he doesn't want me to be part of whatever it is, and I have to respect that.

Now I just have to detangle myself legally from him, and after that, I'll just be left alone with my ugly green wall color. I think I might also adopt a cat as my ex was really allergic.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA. Dude basically said he hates you and everything about you. What are you supposed to do, beg for his love when you can find someone who'll give it to you readily? Nah. Sorry this happened and that you were blindsided, but this will be a good thing in the long run. Onto the next.

FWIW he sounds jealous, insecure and emotionally stunted. If what you've written is how things played out then you dodged a huge bullet.

>**OOP:** He was basically doing his own renditions of ""10 things I hate about you"". Idk... I mean he wants to break up with me, why would i plead? It is done

*To a deleted comment:*

>I was really confused trying to take everything in. He talked really fast and a lot. So I did not know what else to say. Also because everything i do is wrong. I think he would have been even more annoyed if i started to cry or something

*Ghost him now:*

>I can't ghost him. We have to talk about the lease, about our wedding savings account and a few other things.  
*To another commenter:* Yes that is easy said. But I have to wait to get response from the landlord, we have to inform the bak etc etc. So until I don't have confirmation that I am in the clear I am keepig him unblocked. I have him muted tho lol

Commenter: Sounds like his ego couldn't handle you being the breadwinner. Not your problem, he could have communicated like an adult rather than seething in his own insecurities. He sounds emotionally weak.

>**OOP:** Which is so dumb. He is a Dr in Economy and pas persuing becoing a professor

Commenter: Dude basically hates himself for decisions he took without ever consulting you. He chose his comforts but now since others seem in a better position he is venting on you and making you the culprit.

NTA but your man has a little brain and doesn't know what to do with it.

>**OOP:** I would have supported im if he wanted to move away. Idk if we would have stayed together because LDR's are hard, but i would have been 100% supportive.

*Maybe he resented you for being successful while he wasn't:*

>But that is the thing. He was successful! He has even a few published papers in important Magazines and is on the way to become a Jr Professor. He is objectivley really successful. This is all just so weird

Commenter: Girl I’ve been with a man like that. They want drama. They want toxicity. They will fuck up your life out of pure insecurity and hate. You dodged a MASSIVE bullet. I’m sorry this happened, you deserve better. Wish you the best❤️

>**OOP:** Then I hope he meets the Telenovela star of his dreams! I prefer my boring happy life

Commenter: What country are you in? Here in the US, the avg person would have accumulated debt if they made it that far in their edu.

>**OOP:** Germany

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gzr7wg/update_aitah_for_being_disgusted_and_just_saying/)**: November 25, 2024 (1 month later)**

To start, Alex moved out pretty quickly after the breakup. He has been staying with a friend, and we sorted out everything like mail, subscriptions, and the lease.

I’m also in the process of adopting a cat. Her name is Luna, but I have been thinking about changing it since my family already has two pets named Luna, a Moon, and Qamar. She is still at her foster home for now, but I have visited her a few times, and I already adore her. She is a scrappy little tabby who follows her foster mom around like a shadow, and I can’t wait for her to move in during the first week of December. I’ve already gotten her bowls, toys, and a bed by the window ready.

Now onto what happened. Last week, I was out showing someone around the city. He is the son of my parents’ friends who recently moved here for work. My parents asked me to help him get familiar with the area, so I agreed. It was nothing special, just walking around, grabbing coffee, and pointing out useful spots in the city.

Apparently, Alex saw us.

I didn’t even realize he was there, but later that night, I started getting texts from an unknown number. I guess he got a new number since I blocked his old one. The texts were just weird. He accused me of flaunting my “new relationship” in public, said I must have been seeing this guy before we broke up, and told me that everything he suspected about me was true.

I didn’t respond. I wasn’t going to entertain his paranoia. The messages kept coming though. They went from angry to desperate, with him saying things like, “At least admit you were lying to me,” and, “Was anything about us even real?” It was exhausting and honestly a little scary to see how quickly he spiraled.

For the record, this guy isn’t my boyfriend. He’s not even someone I’m interested in. He’s just the son of family friends who needed help settling into the city. The whole thing was completely innocent, but Alex has twisted it into some kind of betrayal in his head.

What gets me is how little Alex seems to know me. I’m not the type of person to jump into a relationship so soon after everything that happened. Even if I were, it wouldn’t be any of his business. We are done. I’ve made that clear.

After I didn’t respond to his texts, Alex started calling. I didn’t pick up, but the voicemails were a mix of angry rants and desperate pleas. I ended up blocking his new number too. It feels ridiculous that I have to keep doing this, but I guess this is where we are now.

Then this weekend, I went out to a bar with my friends. A few hours in, guess who walked in? Alex.

I don’t know if it was a coincidence or if he followed me there, but as soon as he spotted me, he came straight over. He was clearly upset, asking to talk, and I told him no. My friends stepped in, and thankfully, he left without causing a scene, but it ruined my night. It felt like I couldn’t escape him, no matter where I went or what I did.

When I got home later that night, I was completely drained. I had just started to relax when I heard a knock on my door. It was Alex, standing there in tears.

He started crying, saying he missed me, that he didn’t understand why I was “doing this to him,” and that he didn’t know how to move on. It was like all the anger from earlier had been replaced with this desperate sadness. I didn’t let him in. I told him he needed to leave, and if he didn’t, I would call someone to make him leave. He begged me to listen, but I just closed the door.

I spent the rest of the night feeling shaken and honestly a little scared. I don’t know what he’s going through. I wrote his best friend about the situation but the plea of talking to him. He said he would.

I’m seriously considering getting a new phone number and possibly even talking to someone about how to handle this legally if it keeps happening. It feels unfair that I have to go to these lengths just to have some peace, but I don’t see another option.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h1u374/final_update_aitah_for_being_disgusted_and_just/) **2: November 28, 2024 (3 days later)**

Thanks for the concern and support I’ve received. I’m fine. Really. A lot of people suggested things like getting a restraining order, but I just want to clarify that it’s not as simple as walking into an office and asking for one. The process involves proving there’s an immediate danger to your safety, providing evidence like texts, calls, or witnesses, and then attending court to get approval. It’s not something you can do lightly or without solid proof.

And no, I’m obviously not getting a gun.

I’ve also seen people diagnosing Alex with various mental health issues, and I want to ask everyone to stop. Yes, something is clearly wrong, but I’m not a doctor, and neither are most of you. It’s not fair or helpful to label him with something like bipolar disorder or anything else without real expertise.

For what it’s worth, I don’t actually feel like I’m in danger. In the past month, these were the only three incidents that happened. I don’t think he’s actively stalking me so much as he just knew my patterns. The bar we were at is my favorite spot, and it was a party of one of my closest friends, so it makes sense that he might have guessed I’d be there. when he showed up at my apartment, he knows what time I usually get home. The city tour is the only thing that might have been more intentional, but it could also have been a coincidence that triggered everything.

Anyway, this is the end of it. Yesterday, Alex came over with his mom and one of his friends.

At first, I didn’t want to let him in, but he promised me that this would be the last time I ever saw him. I agreed, mostly because his mom and friend were there, and I figured it would be more awkward to argue on my doorstep.

When we sat down, Alex admitted that he was going through a crisis. He told me he was mad at me, but he didn’t know why. He said he doesn’t like me, that I annoy him, but that he weirdly still loves me, which is why he went crazy when he saw me with someone else. He assured me there wasn’t anyone else on his end either.

He said he felt like he was going insane. He talked about how he feels judged for being older and not being able to give me the life he thinks I deserve. He said he hates his colleagues, hates his job, hates everything right now, and that everyone and everything annoys him. He told me he feels old and like he should want kids at this point in his life, but he doesn’t, and that thought terrifies him. He said he just wants to be alone and not talk to anyone for a while.

I didn’t say much. I mostly just nodded because I didn’t know what to say.

After he was done, he told me he was leaving. He’s on some kind of mental health leave from work, and he said he’s leaving the country on Sunday. He’s going to South America to spend time in nature and “find himself.” He thanked me for everything and said he was sorry for how he acted. Then he just got up, grabbed the few things he had left at my place, and walked out.

His mom was inconsolable. She kept apologizing to me over and over, saying how embarrassed she was by his behavior. I told her it was okay and that she didn’t need to apologize for him. She cried a lot, and his friend ended up driving her home after Alex left.

I don’t really know how I feel about all of this. Part of me is relieved that it’s over. Part of me feels sad for him because he clearly doesn’t know how to deal with everything he’s feeling. Mostly, though, I just feel tired. I’m glad he’s taking steps to figure himself out, but it’s not my responsibility anymore.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

*On not getting a gun \[editor's note- it was more than likely a downvoted troll who asked, but I liked OOP's response\]*

1. You can’t buy guns at an Aldi
2. It's more dangerous to own a gun when you have no training with it than not owning one.

Commenter: He's a little young for a mid-life crisis, but certainly, the man is having issues with his life choices, and it's tearing him apart.

Your empathy is warranted, but in the end, those troubles are his not yours. Hopefully, this is the last you'll hear of him.

Good luck to you.

>**OOP:** It's just a life crisis then I guess. Who knows.

**Update (Same Post): December 3, 2024 (5 days later, about 6 weeks from OG post)**

**Edit 03.12** He is definitely gone. My friend sent me some of his insta stories of him at the airport and then about a day later in Bogota. So, yep, he is gone. I am safe, and on Friday, I get to pick up Helios Maximus the first, lol. Heli for short.

1hau5wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1hau5wl/suggestion_that_may_help_with_mj_fatigue/,Suggestion That May Help With MJ Fatigue,"Now in my 4th week and delighted to have lost over half a stone which is just amazing for me with PCOS. The only real side effects is feeling more cold than usual (easily solved with an extra layer) and bad fatigue.  I was feeling really wrecked with tiredness, particularly in the mornings and a bit brain-foggy too even though I was clearly eating enough calories including complex carbs. It was taking me twice as much coffee to get going in the mornings.

However, I discovered a recommendation on r/zepboundathletes  (I usually run a bit but have been finding that really hard on MJ) that I thought worth amplifying here and that's electrolytes. I took 2 electrolyte tablets in water for 2 days and then have been taking one a day for a few days since and I feel completely back to normal, energy wise. The maximum recommended number of the brand I take (Science in Sport Hydro) is 4 a day but I think this is really only if you are doing a lot of hard exercise and would be sweating a great deal.

So putting it out there in case it helps anybody else although it's only my experience and   not any kind of medical advice which I'm not at all qualified to give. Obviously electrolytes include sodium which may not be good for people on low sodium diets and there may be other reasons why they're not right for you.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I asked him to take our son to his doctor appointment for me because something came up with work so I couldn’t do it, and he didn’t have to work until late night. Let me tell you, the amount of complaining how he wanted to relax because he had to work tonight. He slept early last night, slept in, left to get himself coffee and was gonna play video games or watch Netflix until I asked if he could take him instead of me because of work. I was willing to move things around at work, if he really didn’t want to, but I was already the total bad guy in his eyes. He was back home in 2 hours and everything was fine. Like he freaked out so bad and then come back as if everything was normal. So I played it off. Things were fine, and I was working and we were having small talks.


Then when I asked him if he preferred me to take our youngest with me to a school thing for our oldest to. And he said “you can leave him here but I’m gonna be sleeping.” Then I responded “then I can just take him with me if you’re not gonna be watching him.” And he spun that whole conversation so fast yelling at me how I’m supposed to just know what I need to do because he clearly has that big job tonight and needs his rest and here I am taking that away from him so he can go to work all tired. He said I asked a dumb question, and he made his facial expression like “duhhhhh” like mimicking a dumb person and it was hurting my feelings and I got so frustrated that I just wanted to cry but no tears are coming out. I asked him why does he talk to me like he hates me? He truly think he’s not acting angry at me, just annoyed. He kept calling me bro which he knows I hate to be called so much. I asked him to stop for years and he still won’t, and does this to make me even more upset. 


I sent him a long text which I’m sure he won’t read but of me pouring out my heart and frustration. Then I told him the engagement is off and put my ring somewhere safe. Here I am in my kid’s bunk bed watching them sleep and finally the tears are flowing. I truly don’t know what to do. 8 years of this and I want to leave so bad. He’s so mean to me and sees me as such a horrible person. He doesn’t understand how much his words hurts, he keeps saying I need to learn to let it roll off my back, how weak I am, how I need to grow a backbone. Like why would I want to live a miserable life being around people that shouts at me and criticizes me for everything I do? His family may have been like that with him, but I’m not like his family.

I'm hoping this sub can help!

My preferred beer styles, in order are:

1. Hazy double or triple IPAs -- I prefer ones with lots of body, citrus, and on the sweeter side.  One perfect example is [Pantless Thunder Goose ](https://www.mastlandingbrewing.com/pantless-thunder-goose)(by Mass Landing as it so happens)
2. Stouts -- Looking for lots of body, and rich flavor.  Unfortunately, I find most stouts miss.  They’re some combination of too thin and lacking in flavor (Guinness), or they’re WAY over-flavored, and really more of a dessert stout w/ tons of sweetness, or they could pass as a weird coffee.  Barrel aged stuff often gets overbearing with the barrel (or booze) flavor, which I say being a bourbon enthusiast.  Example: Founders used to have a few knockout stouts, but it has been a minute since I’ve had them.  I have had The Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing, and can get that locally, so I'm skipping that one.
3. Porters - Same general notes as the Stouts, really.
4. Milkshake Sours - I don’t really know if this is just a Mortalis thing or if anyone else makes them.  I don’t like ‘normal’ sours, but I really enjoy some of these from Mortalis.  They’re pretty much exactly what they sound like - a boozy sour (really more sweet than sour) fruit milkshake.

From what I remember, the family was white, a mother, father, older sister and younger 11-ish old brother.
She finds that something is after her brother, through cameras(?)
Tries to show her parents and theres nothing
She tries to tell her brother(I believe it appeared to him as an ""imaginary"" friend"" not sure) but it tried to kill her brother once(with a fallen chandelier I believe
And then he accidentally set fire to the house or the sister did, either way she got blamed
And the cameras caught none of it
From a birds pov, facing the fireplaces, the stairs was to the right? A big rug which I believe took some part in the house catching fire. A coffee table behind the rug and 2 couches? I don't know if that helps much
I do know at the end she ran out the house, terrrified trying to look for help. Only to find the whole neighborhood is possessed by this demon and she can't save her brother or sum, I think it ends with her running at the camera.
A lot of the movie was dark to me. I have no idea about the girls name or the movie poster. I think it was a foggy green when she was running in the street, very shaky camera.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that can dramatically enhance your smile. Many people seek this treatment with high hopes, expecting to see stunning results. The transformative effects of teeth whitening are often documented through striking before and after photos that showcase the remarkable change. Understanding what to expect from this treatment can help you decide if it’s right for you.

### The Benefits of Teeth Whitening

One of the main reasons people opt for teeth whitening is the boost in confidence that comes with a brighter smile. Here are some key benefits:

- **Improved Appearance:** Whiter teeth enhance your overall look and can make you appear healthier.
- **Boosted Self-Esteem:** A radiant smile helps build self-confidence in both personal and professional settings.
- **Youthful Feel:** Brighter teeth can enhance the perception of youthfulness, making you feel more vibrant.
- **Affordable Treatment:** Compared to other cosmetic procedures, teeth whitening is relatively cost-effective.

### What to Expect: The Process

Teeth whitening can be done in various ways. The most common options are in-office treatments and at-home kits. In-office procedures can yield faster results, sometimes within an hour. On the other hand, at-home kits often take a couple of weeks to show noticeable changes. It’s essential to consider which method suits your lifestyle best.

### Before and After: What Changes to Anticipate

Before undergoing a whitening treatment, you might experience some common concerns:

- **Discoloration Causes:** Understand what has caused your teeth to lose their whiteness. Natural aging, consumption of staining foods, and poor dental hygiene can all play a role.
- **Sensitivity:** Many individuals experience increased sensitivity before starting treatment, especially if their enamel is already weak.

After the treatment, the changes can be striking. Most individuals notice significant improvement in the brightness of their teeth, often ranging from two to eight shades lighter. The process not only enhances the color of your teeth but also promotes a more uniform appearance.

### Maintaining Your Results

After enjoying the results of your teeth whitening treatment, it’s crucial to maintain your new smile. Here are some practical tips:

- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing help prevent stain buildup.
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Be cautious with coffee, tea, red wine, and berries, as they can cause discoloration.
- **Use Touch-Up Treatments:** At-home whitening kits can help prolong the results.
- **Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Regular visits to your dentist can keep your teeth in optimal condition.

### Real Stories: Transformative Effects

Many individuals have shared their experiences with teeth whitening, showcasing the powerful before and after effects. For instance:

- **Jessica:** After her wedding, Jessica felt self-conscious about her darker teeth. After a professional whitening session, she was thrilled with her bright, beautiful smile.
- **Mark:** As an actor, Mark knew that a bright smile was crucial for his career. Following a whitening procedure, he noticed increased auditions and confidence levels.

The powerful transformation is not merely cosmetic; it often leads to improved social interactions and personal happiness. Emotional wellbeing can greatly improve when you feel confident in your smile, showcasing the profound impacts of this simple yet effective procedure.

Safe and Effective Teeth Whitening Methods for Stunning Smiles
--------------------------------------------------------------

Having a stunning smile can boost your confidence and make a lasting impression. Many people are turning to teeth whitening methods to enhance their smiles. However, it's essential to choose methods that are safe and effective. Here we explore various teeth whitening options, helping you make an informed decision.

### Understanding Teeth Discoloration

Before diving into whitening methods, it's crucial to understand why teeth can become discolored. Common reasons include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Diet:** Foods and beverages like coffee, tea, red wine, and certain fruits can stain teeth.
- **Tobacco Use:** Smoking or chewing tobacco can lead to yellow or brown patches.
- **Age:** As you age, the enamel on your teeth wears thin, revealing the yellow dentin beneath.
- **Poor Dental Hygiene:** Infrequent brushing and flossing can lead to plaque build-up, discoloring teeth.

### Professional Whitening Treatments

One of the most effective ways to achieve white teeth is through professional whitening treatments offered by dentists. Here are the commonly used methods:

#### In-Office Treatments

These treatments are fast and yield immediate results. Using a concentrated whitening gel, dentists can achieve up to several shades lighter in just one appointment. Common procedures include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Zoom Whitening:** A light-activated whitening system that results in immediate, noticeable change.
- **Laser Whitening:** This method uses laser light to enhance the whitening effect of the gel.

#### Take-Home Kits

Many dentists provide custom take-home kits, allowing you to whiten your teeth at home. These kits usually include:

- **Custom trays:** Designed to fit your teeth perfectly, ensuring even application of the whitening gel.
- **Whitening gel:** A less concentrated formula than in-office treatments but effective with consistent use.

### At-Home Whitening Solutions

If visiting a dentist isn't feasible for you, there are several at-home whitening options. Here are some popular methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Whitening Strips

Whitening strips are a convenient and popular choice. They come pre-coated with a hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide gel. Just apply them to your teeth as directed. Most people notice results within a few days.

#### Whitening Toothpaste

These toothpaste products contain mild abrasives that help remove surface stains. While they may not provide dramatic results, they can be a good maintenance option after using stronger treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Baking Soda and Hydrogen Peroxide

Mixing baking soda and hydrogen peroxide creates a paste that can safely whiten teeth. Use it a few times a week to help gently lift stains.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Options

For those looking for more natural methods, several options can help brighten your smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Coconut Oil Pulling

This ancient practice involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth for 10-20 minutes. Not only does it help reduce plaque, but it can also lead to a whiter smile over time.

#### Apple Cider Vinegar

Due to its acidic nature, apple cider vinegar can help remove surface stains. However, it's important to use it sparingly, as overuse can erode enamel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Things to Consider

When choosing a whitening method, keep these factors in mind:

- **Sensitivity:** Some whitening treatments may lead to tooth sensitivity. Consult a dentist if you're prone to sensitivity.
- **Maintenance:** To keep your smile bright, practice good oral hygiene and consider periodic touch-ups.
- **Consultation:** It's advisable to consult with your dentist to determine the best whitening method for your needs.

Whether opting for professional treatments or DIY methods, achieving a whiter smile is within reach. Safe and effective teeth whitening can help you flash a stunning smile confidently. Enjoy the journey to brighter teeth, and remember—consistency is key!

### Conclusion

Achieving a brighter smile can significantly enhance your confidence and overall appearance. The transformative effects of teeth whitening are evident in the striking before and after results that many people experience. Whether you're preparing for a special event or simply wishing to boost your everyday smile, the difference can be remarkable. Those who have undergone whitening treatments often report not only improved aesthetics but also a renewed sense of self-esteem.

I have a good amount of anxiety, and I’m young and I’m learning how to deal with it, but sometimes it’ll still come back to nip me in the butt. I’m sure this will subside as I grow older but I’m worried at the same time it won’t and I’ll have trouble if I want to join the army. I’d be willing to deal with any of those anxious thoughts if that ment I could join, I’m just worried it’ll get in the way. I was wondering if any of you deal with similar and how it is when you enlist. For reference I’d like to be some kind of nurse or combat medic.

Public Affairs or Aircrew?

I’m having trouble picking a job, let alone a branch.

I’m currently majoring in theater and would like to major in film and photography.

The only job that I feel I connect the most with and has good transferability in the civilian world is Public Affairs. I’d be pretty content with a job like that, but it’s taken me a few years to come to that realization.

When I was first starting out, I wanted to be a Loadmaster in the Air Force because I heard how often they traveled and the money was good. One enlistment would be cool, but I don’t think that would sustain me after 4 years. I was always meant to create.

\- Hello! I'm currently on felony probation. (low level stuff for instance I still have my 2A rights after some time, nothing drug related, nothing violent, nothing sexual, nothing vandalized, no threats, honestly, if you must know I violated an EPO but it wasn't classified as Domestic Violence, as you know DV cases entails the Lautenberg Amendment rules and I still have my right to firearms so no worries there (going to basic and being handed a rifle... duh)

When I was incarcerated, in Booking I was 100% transparent.

  
My question is, when I was in booking for the first day I filled out an ""Intake Form"".

Here they asked me if I was in any gangs, used any drugs in my life, medical issues, etc.

I am wondering if I was approved (conviction waiver) and went to MEPS (people in the service know that when you go to MEPS you sign a disclosure that waives your rights to HIPAA (Medical Confidentiality))

will my Jail Intake Form be visible or requestable? I admitted on that form to using weed in highschool twice. I was 18 and scared so I did everything they asked and answered truthfully. Even got beat up pretty bad for it cause they thought I would snitch cause I was buddy-ing up with the CO's

I understand the full scope of what's going on here and I know it's not in my best interest to commit a felony because a popular thing I see is that sometimes recruits get a Drug Waiver or are told to straight up lie at MEPS about it. (if they are clean then its under the rug forever, ask and dont tell)

  
If I were to lie at meps about drug use (my use of weed in high school) without signing a waiver (cause I'd be clean anyways and I didn't tell a recruiter about that yet.) then in the event they got ahold of my jail intake form at MEPS after signing the HIPAA disclosure. (which is a very niche thing to get ahold of but its the U.S. Military, so it may not be a far fetched Idea at all.) then...

I'd be committing a felony if I am not mistaken.

This could be real help here since I scored a 94 on the ASVAB and my mom is a retired veteran of 21 years (SFC, U.S. Army) and it would make her proud to see me carry her torch. I tried and looked everywhere for an answer to this question but I just couldn't find one I even called MEPS and the Jail I was incarcerated in for a few months to ask and they couldn't give me an answer.

  
Salute to the people who give me a proper answer. I would fight tooth and nail for this country any day of the week, any hour of the day, any minute of the hour. I'd rather it be me than some kid.

  
Thank you.

Losing weight before BCT

I'm currently 235 about 5'10, I joined DEP about 3 or so months ago and have been going to drill. Between the last 2 drills I ended up getting my shit together and actually eating right and putting off weight (right before the drill date due to being lazy really, no excuses) and went down to 228. Currently back to my 235. Just looking for some good exercises to help me lose weight nothing crazy. 

I know it starts in the kitchen. I've limited myself to less than 1850 calories a day so I'm actively looking at boxes and what I consume. Nothing but water atm and no sweets. I don't leave until next June so I got some time to work on it. Thanks for any advice.

Question for 35P/35Ms:

I'm going to enlist soon and want to be a crypto-linguist. There are two contract options: I can either sign as a 35W for 3 years or a 35W for 5 years. 

My recruiter told me that if I sign for 5 years I will get 35P, and if I sign for 3 years I will get 35M. Is this true? Is this guaranteed? 

He is being unclear about this, since he says my contract will be extended anyway, even if I sign for 3 years. So, if I sign for 3 years, is it guaranteed that they assign me 35M, or could they assign me to 35P and extend it to 5 years? Please help me understand this

Hello everyone,
I went and took a practice asvab at the recruiters office. I scored an 84 overall on my asvab score and they are pushing me to go to MEPS as they believe my score is good and tell me I can get any job I want with that score. I feel as if that’s not the case and am stressing over it. Can you give me any advice on this.

Hi all, Can the current unit your in force you to transfer to another unit/ duty station? 

Today was my first meeting with my unit after 2 months of completing BCT/AIT. It was a headquarters or a brigade something like that. And I’m a 12B (combat engineer)E3
 National guard. When I first got there they made it seem like I was going to be bored there since they don’t really do 12B stuff. Which I don’t mind. They said I will just be a coffee getter or a driver for them. They told me that I need to transfer out of there. But the new unit they trying to transfer me to is 1hr way from my house compared to a 20 min drive to my current unit. 

They were talking about a voluntary transfer something like that which I don’t want to transfer. There goal is to get all 12B slot out. I asked them wouldn’t they just send another 12B if I transfer out and he said that if that’s the case he would rather have a 12B(E5 or above). So if I don’t agree to do the volunteer transfer can they still force me out?

I'm going to Future Soldier Training as the only ""Specialist"" among several other ""Privates"" and I'm being expected to be a ""leader"" among the group. It's pretty ill-suited for my personality but I'm willing to put up with it. What I'm worried about is BCT in a few months. My hope was to stick to the middle of the pack and try to lay low to avoid any unnecessary attention from the Srill Sargents. Is my higher rank gonna screw me over in this? I honestly do not want to deal with any leadership burdens when I'm literally no better at being a soldier than anyone else.

Hi I recently made the choice to start losing Weight to enlist I'm 25 and have gotten down to 240 so I went to my local recruiter to start the process of going in with the arms 2.0 stuff. Only issue I'm having now is I have given all my info to my recruiter went and took my asvab and got a decent score from my understanding (83 not sure what it's out of but was told it's good enough for what I wanted to do) and now we where supposed to set up getting a physical at meps. But now my recruiter is telling me that my pre-screen packet has been put on a ten day hold and he didn't say if he knew why. Should I be worried about it? I haven't been diagnosed with anything that would medically disqualify me although I have talked to my doctor before about a sleep apnea test and I did get an ekg cause I was worried something was wrong with my heart but I never did the sleep test and the ekg was non conclusive. I just want to know if I'm over thinking the hold or if I should plan around not being allowed in now?

Recruiter needs me to make a decision tomorrow:

I'm stuck between choosing to enlist as a 35W with a 5 year contract, or a 35N with a 3 year contract. I'm anxious about spending 5 years in the military, and would prefer a shorter length of commitment (it's 5 years because of the long period of training). However, I'm also excited about the idea of attending DLI and potentially working as a linguist. What is the better choice? Do you think DLI, the work and language training is worth the 5 years, or am I better off doing 3 years as a 35N and having 2 years more freedom even if I'm not as excited about the opportunity?

# Option 19 (MOS 12N) - Seeking More Information

I just signed the contact at the MEPS with MOS 12N. I chose option 19 when I signed the contract and my first duty station will be Fort Campbell, KY. Does it mean that I am guaranteed to be sent there after AIT? Will there be any changes from the Army's side? If yes, how often does it happen and how will it impact on my contract? I wanted to wait for the 92 Y, but it was not available. Option 19 incentivized me so I chose it. Did I make a right choice?

Army Enlistment help

Hello all! I’m currently in the process of enlisting in the army and I wanted to get an opinion/verification on what my recruiter is telling me. Exact message below:

“17D/17C are rarely ever available. It’s more like you apply for it 2 years into your contract but I can definitely find a 25 MOS for you”

So initially, I told him that I’m enlisting for 17 series MOS jobs because that’s what I wanted to do. I got a good asvab score that basically let me qualify for any job in the army but cyber operations and development is my niche and I have experience in the area. What I wanted to know is if what he said in the text is true and I can later apply for a 17d/c mos. Before anyone says anything lol, I already talked to two air force recruiters and they said they’re only hiring for security forces and aviation jobs right now, so that’s why I was checking out the army. Any advice is helpful, thanks.

Second of all I want to enlist to be 12r, if I do that will I be able to get a job as a journeyman Electrician after serving my 4 years? Additionally I want to know do 12r soldiers get deployed often? I plan on enlisting in active duty. Another thing I want

Recently decided to renenlist after being out about a decade. Formerly a 25N this time around heading for 12P before I get to power school I will have to attend 12B OSUT. Recruiter said it's kinda 50/50 if I'll just be treated as IET or if I'll get an accelerated bct then off to AIT. I haven't seen much mentioned about this. Does anyone post COVID have any knowledge about this? Preferably info specific to 12B at Leonard Wood but I'll take anything I can get.

I know a lot of these questions could be answered through a recruiter but felt this would be a nice place to get some general advice. 

I am a civilian now but I was Enlisted for 6 years in the reserve, got out as an E5 with 1 overseas deployment under my belt. I got out though because I hated being enlisted, and my unit/leadership was honestly not great either. I was 25 series (signal) for reference.

Now I have completed my bachelors in Data Analytics and honestly finding the job economy is quite bad right now unless you have connections (I dont). 

I am seriously considering the Officer path now but not sure if I should go Air Force or Army. Army I'm more familiar with of course but Air Force everyone says is more enjoyable. I honestly hate field shit so if possible I'd try to be something technical. 

Long story short here is some of my questions if anyone could please help answer:

1. Would it be pointless to commission in reserves/national guard if I'm trying to make money mainly. I feel like being part time will not help me at all really and be just a chore. But the ability to stay local if there is full time options is appealing. 

2. If I do go this route, will my time spent enlisted count towards my time in grade or increase my starting pay?

3. Is the commission process bad? Is it difficult/easy to fail? I know nothing really about it, was never explained to me. 

4. Am I a dumbass if I want to do pog stuff and pick Army? Should I just do Air Force in this case? 

Thanks for literally any input guys appreciate it

I am currently in the process of putting an officer packet together. Today, I had phone calls with people who would be willing to write me letters and they all, rightly so, asked me to send them information about what they need to do. When I asked my recruiter what I should send them for guidance, he responded “just have them send a letter of recommendation to your email.” This info didn’t help me at all. Although he has been EXTREMELY helpful so far he has also never submitted an officer packet. Is there a more official process, or more official guideline I should send them instead of “please send a letter of recommendation to my email?” Thank you ahead of time for your response.

Going to MEPS on Wednesday with a reservation for 37F, on the temp reservation doc it shows my estimated training pipeline as 19 weeks and 4 days at Leonard wood, 6 weeks and 3 days at Moore, and 2 weeks and 4 days at lwood for OSUT. Is anyone familiar with the specifics on this training pipeline? Is it in that exact order? Is airborne included somewhere in there? I’ve researched on YT but a lot of the info out was from four years ago and I asked my recruiter if airborne is part of it and he said no. Everything I’ve seen about the training says it is, including the goarmy site. Also, is the 19 weeks including my 10 week BCT? Or is it 10 weeks of BCT first and then to fort lwood? Just wanting a better understanding of how long I’ll be away from my family since I know upon selection you will then start language school as the last part of your training which could add another chunk of time on.

I am considering Finance or AG Officer currently. I was told that Finance doesn't really go to many places. AG I'm not sure about either. I was wondering if any FI or AG officers could offer their knowledge about duty stations y'all have been to and or seen for either FI or AG. I mean I would be perfectly fine if they just send me back and forth from Korea and somewhere stateside but if there are more opportunities overseas too id love to hear about those different overseas duty stations. Thanks!

Asthma Question

Hey there, I am highschool student trying to plan out my path for life. I’ve always aspired to be officer in the army but I’ve heard asthma is a disqualification. I’d say im in very good shape, I plan to play collegiate rugby. I workout 5times a week and eat a good diet. But when I do any physical activity I need to have my albuterol inhaler with me at all times. Would they let me go to OCS if I needed my inhaler? I always use a daily asthmatic inhaler in the morning and night. Is my aspirations feasible? I’ll take any advice please

I have a good amount of anxiety, and I’m young and I’m learning how to deal with it, but sometimes it’ll still come back to nip me in the butt. I’m sure this will subside as I grow older but I’m worried at the same time it won’t and I’ll have trouble if I want to join the army. I’d be willing to deal with any of those anxious thoughts if that ment I could join, I’m just worried it’ll get in the way. I was wondering if any of you deal with similar and how it is when you enlist. For reference I’d like to be some kind of nurse or combat medic.

Public Affairs or Aircrew?

I’m having trouble picking a job, let alone a branch.

I’m currently majoring in theater and would like to major in film and photography.

The only job that I feel I connect the most with and has good transferability in the civilian world is Public Affairs. I’d be pretty content with a job like that, but it’s taken me a few years to come to that realization.

When I was first starting out, I wanted to be a Loadmaster in the Air Force because I heard how often they traveled and the money was good. One enlistment would be cool, but I don’t think that would sustain me after 4 years. I was always meant to create.

\- Hello! I'm currently on felony probation. (low level stuff for instance I still have my 2A rights after some time, nothing drug related, nothing violent, nothing sexual, nothing vandalized, no threats, honestly, if you must know I violated an EPO but it wasn't classified as Domestic Violence, as you know DV cases entails the Lautenberg Amendment rules and I still have my right to firearms so no worries there (going to basic and being handed a rifle... duh)

When I was incarcerated, in Booking I was 100% transparent.

  
My question is, when I was in booking for the first day I filled out an ""Intake Form"".

Here they asked me if I was in any gangs, used any drugs in my life, medical issues, etc.

I am wondering if I was approved (conviction waiver) and went to MEPS (people in the service know that when you go to MEPS you sign a disclosure that waives your rights to HIPAA (Medical Confidentiality))

will my Jail Intake Form be visible or requestable? I admitted on that form to using weed in highschool twice. I was 18 and scared so I did everything they asked and answered truthfully. Even got beat up pretty bad for it cause they thought I would snitch cause I was buddy-ing up with the CO's

I understand the full scope of what's going on here and I know it's not in my best interest to commit a felony because a popular thing I see is that sometimes recruits get a Drug Waiver or are told to straight up lie at MEPS about it. (if they are clean then its under the rug forever, ask and dont tell)

  
If I were to lie at meps about drug use (my use of weed in high school) without signing a waiver (cause I'd be clean anyways and I didn't tell a recruiter about that yet.) then in the event they got ahold of my jail intake form at MEPS after signing the HIPAA disclosure. (which is a very niche thing to get ahold of but its the U.S. Military, so it may not be a far fetched Idea at all.) then...

I'd be committing a felony if I am not mistaken.

This could be real help here since I scored a 94 on the ASVAB and my mom is a retired veteran of 21 years (SFC, U.S. Army) and it would make her proud to see me carry her torch. I tried and looked everywhere for an answer to this question but I just couldn't find one I even called MEPS and the Jail I was incarcerated in for a few months to ask and they couldn't give me an answer.

  
Salute to the people who give me a proper answer. I would fight tooth and nail for this country any day of the week, any hour of the day, any minute of the hour. I'd rather it be me than some kid.

  
Thank you.

Losing weight before BCT

I'm currently 235 about 5'10, I joined DEP about 3 or so months ago and have been going to drill. Between the last 2 drills I ended up getting my shit together and actually eating right and putting off weight (right before the drill date due to being lazy really, no excuses) and went down to 228. Currently back to my 235. Just looking for some good exercises to help me lose weight nothing crazy. 

I know it starts in the kitchen. I've limited myself to less than 1850 calories a day so I'm actively looking at boxes and what I consume. Nothing but water atm and no sweets. I don't leave until next June so I got some time to work on it. Thanks for any advice.

Question for 35P/35Ms:

I'm going to enlist soon and want to be a crypto-linguist. There are two contract options: I can either sign as a 35W for 3 years or a 35W for 5 years. 

My recruiter told me that if I sign for 5 years I will get 35P, and if I sign for 3 years I will get 35M. Is this true? Is this guaranteed? 

He is being unclear about this, since he says my contract will be extended anyway, even if I sign for 3 years. So, if I sign for 3 years, is it guaranteed that they assign me 35M, or could they assign me to 35P and extend it to 5 years? Please help me understand this

Hello everyone,
I went and took a practice asvab at the recruiters office. I scored an 84 overall on my asvab score and they are pushing me to go to MEPS as they believe my score is good and tell me I can get any job I want with that score. I feel as if that’s not the case and am stressing over it. Can you give me any advice on this.

Hi all, Can the current unit your in force you to transfer to another unit/ duty station? 

Today was my first meeting with my unit after 2 months of completing BCT/AIT. It was a headquarters or a brigade something like that. And I’m a 12B (combat engineer)E3
 National guard. When I first got there they made it seem like I was going to be bored there since they don’t really do 12B stuff. Which I don’t mind. They said I will just be a coffee getter or a driver for them. They told me that I need to transfer out of there. But the new unit they trying to transfer me to is 1hr way from my house compared to a 20 min drive to my current unit. 

They were talking about a voluntary transfer something like that which I don’t want to transfer. There goal is to get all 12B slot out. I asked them wouldn’t they just send another 12B if I transfer out and he said that if that’s the case he would rather have a 12B(E5 or above). So if I don’t agree to do the volunteer transfer can they still force me out?

I'm going to Future Soldier Training as the only ""Specialist"" among several other ""Privates"" and I'm being expected to be a ""leader"" among the group. It's pretty ill-suited for my personality but I'm willing to put up with it. What I'm worried about is BCT in a few months. My hope was to stick to the middle of the pack and try to lay low to avoid any unnecessary attention from the Srill Sargents. Is my higher rank gonna screw me over in this? I honestly do not want to deal with any leadership burdens when I'm literally no better at being a soldier than anyone else.

Hi I recently made the choice to start losing Weight to enlist I'm 25 and have gotten down to 240 so I went to my local recruiter to start the process of going in with the arms 2.0 stuff. Only issue I'm having now is I have given all my info to my recruiter went and took my asvab and got a decent score from my understanding (83 not sure what it's out of but was told it's good enough for what I wanted to do) and now we where supposed to set up getting a physical at meps. But now my recruiter is telling me that my pre-screen packet has been put on a ten day hold and he didn't say if he knew why. Should I be worried about it? I haven't been diagnosed with anything that would medically disqualify me although I have talked to my doctor before about a sleep apnea test and I did get an ekg cause I was worried something was wrong with my heart but I never did the sleep test and the ekg was non conclusive. I just want to know if I'm over thinking the hold or if I should plan around not being allowed in now?

Recruiter needs me to make a decision tomorrow:

I'm stuck between choosing to enlist as a 35W with a 5 year contract, or a 35N with a 3 year contract. I'm anxious about spending 5 years in the military, and would prefer a shorter length of commitment (it's 5 years because of the long period of training). However, I'm also excited about the idea of attending DLI and potentially working as a linguist. What is the better choice? Do you think DLI, the work and language training is worth the 5 years, or am I better off doing 3 years as a 35N and having 2 years more freedom even if I'm not as excited about the opportunity?

# Option 19 (MOS 12N) - Seeking More Information

I just signed the contact at the MEPS with MOS 12N. I chose option 19 when I signed the contract and my first duty station will be Fort Campbell, KY. Does it mean that I am guaranteed to be sent there after AIT? Will there be any changes from the Army's side? If yes, how often does it happen and how will it impact on my contract? I wanted to wait for the 92 Y, but it was not available. Option 19 incentivized me so I chose it. Did I make a right choice?

Army Enlistment help

Hello all! I’m currently in the process of enlisting in the army and I wanted to get an opinion/verification on what my recruiter is telling me. Exact message below:

“17D/17C are rarely ever available. It’s more like you apply for it 2 years into your contract but I can definitely find a 25 MOS for you”

So initially, I told him that I’m enlisting for 17 series MOS jobs because that’s what I wanted to do. I got a good asvab score that basically let me qualify for any job in the army but cyber operations and development is my niche and I have experience in the area. What I wanted to know is if what he said in the text is true and I can later apply for a 17d/c mos. Before anyone says anything lol, I already talked to two air force recruiters and they said they’re only hiring for security forces and aviation jobs right now, so that’s why I was checking out the army. Any advice is helpful, thanks.

I know a lot of these questions could be answered through a recruiter but felt this would be a nice place to get some general advice. 

I am a civilian now but I was Enlisted for 6 years in the reserve, got out as an E5 with 1 overseas deployment under my belt. I got out though because I hated being enlisted, and my unit/leadership was honestly not great either. I was 25 series (signal) for reference.

I am seriously considering the Officer path now but not sure if I should go Air Force or Army. Army I'm more familiar with of course but Air Force everyone says is more enjoyable. I honestly hate field shit so if possible I'd try to be something technical. 

Long story short here is some of my questions if anyone could please help answer:

1. Would it be pointless to commission in reserves/national guard if I'm trying to make money mainly. I feel like being part time will not help me at all really and be just a chore. But the ability to stay local if there is full time options is appealing. 

2. If I do go this route, will my time spent enlisted count towards my time in grade or increase my starting pay?

3. Is the commission process bad? Is it difficult/easy to fail? I know nothing really about it, was never explained to me. 

4. Am I a dumbass if I want to do pog stuff and pick Army? Should I just do Air Force in this case?

Today, I had phone calls with people who would be willing to write me letters and they all, rightly so, asked me to send them information about what they need to do. When I asked my recruiter what I should send them for guidance, he responded “just have them send a letter of recommendation to your email.” This info didn’t help me at all. Although he has been EXTREMELY helpful so far he has also never submitted an officer packet. Is there a more official process, or more official guideline I should send them instead of “please send a letter of recommendation to my email?” Thank you ahead of time for your response.

Going to MEPS on Wednesday with a reservation for 37F, on the temp reservation doc it shows my estimated training pipeline as 19 weeks and 4 days at Leonard wood, 6 weeks and 3 days at Moore, and 2 weeks and 4 days at lwood for OSUT. Is anyone familiar with the specifics on this training pipeline? Is it in that exact order? Is airborne included somewhere in there? I’ve researched on YT but a lot of the info out was from four years ago and I asked my recruiter if airborne is part of it and he said no. Everything I’ve seen about the training says it is, including the goarmy site. Also, is the 19 weeks including my 10 week BCT? Or is it 10 weeks of BCT first and then to fort lwood? Just wanting a better understanding of how long I’ll be away from my family since I know upon selection you will then start language school as the last part of your training which could add another chunk of time on.

I am considering Finance or AG Officer currently. I was told that Finance doesn't really go to many places. AG I'm not sure about either. I was wondering if any FI or AG officers could offer their knowledge about duty stations y'all have been to and or seen for either FI or AG. I mean I would be perfectly fine if they just send me back and forth from Korea and somewhere stateside but if there are more opportunities overseas too id love to hear about those different overseas duty stations. Thanks!

Asthma Question

Hey there, I am highschool student trying to plan out my path for life. I’ve always aspired to be officer in the army but I’ve heard asthma is a disqualification. I’d say im in very good shape, I plan to play collegiate rugby. I workout 5times a week and eat a good diet. But when I do any physical activity I need to have my albuterol inhaler with me at all times. Would they let me go to OCS if I needed my inhaler? I always use a daily asthmatic inhaler in the morning and night. Is my aspirations feasible? I’ll take any advice please

# Well, it happened. I branched chem. What do I do from here?

I wanted one of the logistics branches, but I guess that wasn't in the cards for me. What should I do to be a good chem officer, and is it possible for me to get out of chem and go into logistics in the future?

No lie, this pole has been VERY good to me! I have been on and off poling throughout the 2 years and my pole hasn't fallen not even once! I have inverted, switch between static and spin, free flowed, etc. And have had no issues. Well, I recently turned 30 and wanted to redecorate my house and give it a more modern/minimalistic adult feel. Surprisingly- or maybe no surprise here- I wanted to keep my pole where its always been- my living room- but just shift it a little to the right. I started redecorating in my LR. After my couch and coffee table got here, I was ready to move my pole but, I can't get it down. I really just wanted to move the pole over to the right a little to give my couch breathing room and for when I wanted to pole, I wouldn't smack my body on various parts of my new furniture BUT I CAN'T GET THE POLE DOWN. And believe me, I have tried EVERYTHING. The ""o ring"" is stuck and will not allow me to loosen the pole to take it down. I watched the F2F take down video on YT a 1000x and my pole will not budge. I reached out to support which practically was a bust and would've been better had I talked to no one. I love Shelly and she's a total sweetheart but truthfully, ima little discouraged and disheartened because I did not think my pole would become an issue. The reason I got this particular pole was due to cost and me living in an apartment and not wanting to damage the ceiling or floor but now the pole is stuck. I am asking/begging/pleading anyone who has had the version 1 of the F2F pole, how did you get the O ring unstuck? Any help/advice you have available would be so helpful.

I’m a 37-year-old white guy from the Midwest, 5’11”, fit, and I’ve been told I’m easy on the eyes (but I’ll let you be the judge). I’m all about humor, adventure, and living life with purpose.

After serving in the military, I’ve built a life that’s solid and fulfilling. I value loyalty, hard work, and keeping things fun, and now I’m ready for what’s next—marriage, kids, and all the joys (and surprises) that come with creating a family.

I don’t smoke or do drugs, but I do enjoy a strong cup of coffee, the occasional drink, and staying active. Whether I’m scuba diving, cooking up a new recipe, working on a DIY project (yes, I renovated my entire house solo), or boating, I’m always keeping busy with things I love. Family is a big part of my life, and I believe in living healthy and staying active—finding someone who feels the same would be amazing.

I’m hoping to meet someone kind, down-to-earth, and emotionally steady, ideally in her 20s or early 30s, who’s ready to build a loving family and share an incredible future. If that sounds like you, I’d love to hear your story and see where this could take us!",1,1733805285.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1hatpvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraKaffe/comments/1hatpvp/tk02_terribly_inefficient_water_usage/,TK-02 Terribly inefficient water usage,"FYI, I used my kitchen scale to measure the water usage in oz in the Carafe, the Drip Tray, in my Coffee Cup, and in the ’spray catcher’ I use (in addition to the drip tray).  

[Water usage](https://preview.redd.it/a1z368nv9y5e1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8f29f317e4abe65256ad9d74aef7dc6d2dad051)

This data leads me to a number of observations / questions:

1. The TK-02 only use a bit less than half of the water from the (tIndy) tank for actual drinks.
2. Why do you force a cleaning cycle on manual wakeup, but allow an Auto-Start drink to ’skip’ the cleaning cycle?  That ‘wastes’ 3 to 4 oz of water on EVERY manual startup!!!
3. Why do you force the use to refill the machine with about 17 oz of water STILL IN THE TANK?  I DO NOT understand why the refill is set with so much water left…?!?!  I would guess, when the water gets low, you don’t want the user to do something that can't be done (not enough water).  OK.  You know what the recipes require, and what the machine uses for cleaning processes. It’s just math — you can gray out drinks if there isn’t enough water to make them (and still do the cleaning processes).  Forcing refills with 17 oz of water still in the tank just feels WAAAAAY too conservative — or even like there is a mistake in the programming?  That is almost 25% of the tank volume!!!  It just doesn’t make any sense!
4. There are about 10 oz water that ‘disappeared’.  The total of water used (60.9 oz) from the carafe should equal the sum of the water in the drip tray, drinks, and my spray catcher combined (only 50.4 oz). Where did the missing water go?!  Inside the machine, I guess?

Look, I know this machine is designed to be small-ish and it has a small water tank.  It also makes a very thoughtful trade-off between manual cleaning (yuck!) and automated cleaning.  I fully appreciate those choices — I agree with them!

However, It feels like there is DEFINITELY some low-hanging-fruit here that could make a meaningful improvement to the water usage efficiency:

* Let the user select a drink to make immediately on manual startup thereby saving the 3-4 oz of cleaning water — just like the auto-wake!  
* Use more of the tank volume before requiring a refill!  And possibly have this indexed against the drink water volumes — ie the bigger water drinks get greyed out first, but you can still make the others… My espresso only uses 2 oz!

I’d wager just these two changes could yield another 15-20 oz of usable water on EACH fill cycle?  That could be enough to get a lot of another drink or two (or three or even more?) before re-fills; a non-trivial improvement!   


Edit: FWIW, I’ve already stopped using my TK-02 for americanos & drip, and now use a hot water kettle. But I shouldn’t have to do that. There is easily a lot more water efficiency available.

Also, my brother bought a TK-02 and returned it because he was so annoyed by chewing through the water tank so fast. we can’t be  the only ones bothered by this…?  🤣",1,1733805223.0,TerraKaffe,3,0.67,False

manfred von karm is ultimate prosecuter and the lover of blaise debeste and revealed to also be lover of damon gant in prison game 5s witu blaise again also and i guess darth turnabout but then darth turnabout endee up being gants father accidental incest but i dont think this should be edited out because its funny simultaneously parodies both the luke leia kiss and i am your father but this isnt darth turnabout cut so idk why i ams aying this ANYWA he also appears in ultra hopelessness female


PRIZON GAME 1
von karma is introduce afger kristoph sat ""and who r u"" which fun fact was a dongo pictures aladdin reference
so basically von karma role includes being blaise close friend/lover and slams his head into wall over ptsd and losing election to ultimate politician paul atisho

sadly von karma life comes to a tragical end when he and alba exchange their motive videos in the mens toilet whic hleads to them both fighting and von karma getting edgeworth ptsd again and killing alba with andistandhin guitar which he left behind in toilet and yhen flushing alba body down the toilet... vln karma is obviously mondo parody here with anger issue motive and bond with blaise who cries so much and this was also used as RED HERRING because tigre being fucking obvious and the gsme playing it straight like he didn't clearly do it is parodie of 11037 and dahlia has similar lines celeste during von karma confrontation which is to imply she will chapter 3 kill but SHOCK she didn't well she did but first is gustavia

his motive is kinda unironical TRAGICAL? he didn't really do anything wrong other than be a massive dumbass because its obvious the whole meet with alba was going to go wrong and he's very close with blaise and ge isn't shitting on alba body and flushing it down toilet to get away with the kill murder its that he wanted to destroy body so that since body never found means no trial but sadly the body ended up in girl toilet instead so maybe one of the most tragic kill prison games

sadly i think he's the worst non-retibz and non-engarde pg1 because the funny things him (entire alba muder) can be trace back to alba and blaise is the more relevant ebtween the two so he is better when comes to tragic romance and his confrontation is kinda just ok its really just a mondo parody while the other pg1 killer are funny on their own merits imo i think the best part is the dragged out emotional scrum debage


THIS IS NOT END OF VON KARM HOWEVER

5s:
von karma is member of old man trio and has sex and things
i think von karma has best role in pg1 but in 5s he has SECOND funniest von karma line im sure you can guess what first is

manfred hold onto his shoulder at the spot were he shot blaise in the shoulder: gant i had a dreame but it was a nightmaire. it was a dream where jigoku was killt in a swimmint pool and it was godot who is another friend of mine that killed himm2 try make coffee

1hatnrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hatnrv/si2_diamonds_expert_tips_for_smart_buying/,SI2 Diamonds: Expert Tips for Smart Buying,"SI2 diamonds represent a critical value threshold in the market, with prices ranging from $1,300 to $7,500 per carat – approximately 40% less than VS2 stones. Market data shows that while only 30% of SI2 diamonds achieve eye-clean status, these select specimens can offer exceptional value, matching the visual appeal of higher clarity grades at significantly lower prices.

This strategic guide provides detailed techniques for identifying high-performing SI2 diamonds, including shape-specific selection criteria, inclusion placement analysis, and expert strategies for maximizing value in this opportunity-rich clarity grade.

# Bottom Line: SI2 Diamonds

When considering SI2 diamonds, keep these key points in mind:

* Clarity Characteristics: SI2 diamonds stand for “Slightly included 2” and have inclusions visible under 10x magnification. About 70% may not be eye-clean, so careful evaluation is crucial.
* Value Proposition: SI2 diamonds can offer fair value, allowing buyers to get a visually appealing stone at a lower price point compared to higher clarity grades.
* If you plan to purchase a lab-grown diamond, there is no reason to get an SI2 diamond as the price difference between SI and VS is negligible. 

* Price Range: Well-cut 1-carat SI2 diamonds typically cost $2,400 to $7,500 from online vendors. In-store prices can be about 40% higher.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious buyers looking to maximize their diamond purchase
* Those comfortable evaluating diamond quality and inclusions
* Shoppers interested in both natural and lab-grown diamond options

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers prioritizing high clarity and flawless appearance
* Individuals seeking diamonds solely for investment purposes
* Those preferring a simplified shopping experience without in-depth assessments

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Great value for those on a budget
* Potential to find eye-clean specimens
* Visual appeal with careful selection

Cons:

* Higher likelihood of visible inclusions
* 70% of SI2 diamonds may not be eye-clean
* Potential durability concerns depending on inclusion type and location

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Focus on eye-clean stones: Carefully examine high-resolution images and videos.
2. Consider diamond shape: Oval, cushion, and marquise cuts tend to hide inclusions better.
3. Review clarity plots: Understand inclusion types and locations to avoid problematic stones.

1. Prioritize cut quality: A well-cut diamond can mask some inclusions and enhance brilliance.
2. Compare prices: Look at both online and in-store options to find the best value.
3. Consider lab-grown alternatives: These offer similar qualities at lower price points.

1. Seek expert opinions: Consult with gemologists or use online tools to evaluate specific diamonds.
2. Don't compromise on certification: Stick with reputable grading labs like GIA for reliable assessments.

# FAQ

However, I understand that sometimes you just need quick, actionable advice without wading through pages of details. That's why I'm sharing these focused 500-word guides – each one delivers key facts and practical recommendations in a format you can read over coffee. These articles distill essential insights from my extensive research, stripped of industry jargon and marketing fluff.

Have questions about SI2 diamonds? Drop them in the comments below – I personally respond to each one and your questions help shape both these guides and my upcoming book",1,1733805021.0,Diamondsreview,0,1.0,False
1hatnm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hatnm9/girl_abruptly_ended_things_after_1_month_of/,Girl abruptly ended things after 1 month of talking and date ,"I’m 24M and recently matched with a girl who I was instantly attracted to on hinge. I’ve been using dating apps for a while now and have been on a few dates (hooked up with 2) and just met a few over coffee, but this one felt different because I seemed to be very physically attracted to her. We started talking and then I got her number and we were texting for some time and met 2 weeks after for our first date which I thought went really well because we spent around 4 hours together. We would talk a lot about qualities and values we’d find in a partner and etc etc, never really asked her directly what she’s looking for but the vibe she gave was that she wants something serious and just by seeing her and speaking to her I was willing to get serious with her.

After our date before leaving she mentioned she’s going to let me know about a 2nd date and that she needs time to let these things sit and process which I found odd. She went home that night and texted me thank you and texted a little more until she said goodnight. I decided not to say anything until she reached back with a clear decisive answer on if she wants to continue with moving things forward with another date and etc but after an entire day goes by she messages me asking hey how’s it going and when I responded she sounded off on how she felt upset and it rubbed her the wrong way that I didn’t say anything for a full day when even though I expressed interest in seeing her and that her speaking as usual would indicate continued interest. Stupid me, I took this as a hint that she’s pretty into me and we kept talking for another week on text and call and even scheduled a 2nd date and she would open up a lot about personal issues going on in her life and etc until she went on a girls trip a couple hours to another city. During the weekend and on this trip she was texting perfectly fine as she always does. Then out of the blue on Monday morning she sent me a message saying she realizes her feelings for me haven’t developed at this stage as she’d hope and that she hopes I can follow through with my other plans on the day we were going to meet again and that I didn’t do anything wrong in particular but that she’s firm on this decision. I told her I wish her the best and left it at that and we haven’t talked since. Now there are a couple details I’m leaving out of this due to anonymity and relevance but would love to get an idea from y’all on whether if I did something wrong or what could cause this abrupt end. I’ve spoken to friends and family about this and have seen other posts on Reddit where this is fairly common but thought I’d put my own experience on here since it’s a bit unique and get people’s perspective on it.",1,1733805009.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I work fully remotely and have for more than six years. My current company does not have a local office. Everyone works remotely in their homes. Last several months have been very difficult to work in my home office/my bedroom. Too many distractions that I am no longer able to Ignore very well.

I have resorted to visiting the local coffee shop shops and the library in my town.  I might spend 4-5 hours in these locations.  I always order beverages, sometimes food.  I always tip.  I am aware of what is going on around me and I try and take up the least amount of space so other patrons can enjoy the shops.  I don’t generally take conference calls, on my call heavy days I stay home.  I rotate through the shops, usually at each once a week (but I do have 2 favorites I frequent more regularly).  I do used their WiFi and power, but I also have a hotspot on my phone and tablet, it’s just not as good a signal.

As an Asian man growing up in the West, I constantly felt boxed in by stereotypes: too small, too quiet, too “unmasculine.” It’s tough to break out of those labels, and for years, I struggled with confidence—especially in dating.

But here’s what I learned: Confidence isn’t about being born a certain way. It’s about building the skills and mindset that allow you to take control of your life. And for me, the key to doing that was **discipline**.

Discipline isn’t about grinding endlessly or forcing yourself to do things you hate. It’s about training your mind to want the things that are good for you. Here are 3 actionable steps that helped me rewire my thinking and transform my life:

1. **Start Small and Be Consistent**: Instead of overwhelming yourself with massive goals, start with small, achievable actions. For example, if you want to improve your social skills, don’t aim to approach 10 women in one night right away. Start by smiling and saying “Hi” to 5 people a day—whether it’s at the grocery store, the gym, or your workplace. Over time, these small steps will build into bigger habits.
2. **Gamify Your Progress**: I’m a data nerd, so I started tracking my actions. Whether it was workouts, social interactions, or even rejections, I recorded them in a notebook or an app. Seeing the numbers improve over time kept me motivated. It turned what used to feel like failure into a game of progress.
3. **Remove Friction**: Set up your environment to make it easy to succeed. For instance, if you’re working on fitness, keep your workout clothes ready the night before or find a gym nearby that’s easy to access. If you want to improve your social skills, pick venues that feel comfortable to you—coffee shops, social clubs, or meetups. By reducing barriers, you’ll naturally stick to your goals.

Discipline helped me lose 60 lbs, overcome approach anxiety, and even succeed in my career. If you’ve ever felt stuck, start with small changes. Progress doesn’t happen overnight, but with consistency, you’ll see your confidence grow day by day.
