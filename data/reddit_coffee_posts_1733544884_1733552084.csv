1h8m24e,https://www.reddit.com/r/energydrinks/comments/1h8m24e/opinions/,Opinions,"Heyo, Just another post from someone looking for opinions on energy drink mix. Currently I've been rocking Sneak but I cant say I'm very happy with what the company has been doing lately. The ingredients in the U.S versions are getting crappier, and the FOMO driven company model I'm thinking about trading companies.

I'm really looking at 2 currently. 

Madrinas is the first. They seem to have a decent selection of energy mixes, more caffeine and a little cheaper than Sneak which I like, and I like the idea of the coffee and tea... tho those are a bit expensive(understandable but still). The beans to make hot coffee is something I like tho too. I'm pretty big on coffee all around lol.

Gamersupps is the second. Basically thic one comes down to the price. Even if you double up scoops to get to a useful level of caffeine it's the cheapest cost per serving. They also have more flavors than most other brands. 

So, what has been y'all's experiences with these brands, hows the taste, and how good are the formulas as far as ingredients and effects? Any info would be cool, thanks.",1,1733551204.0,energydrinks,0,1.0,False

I’m 24, my mom is 56. She was diagnosed with
dementia when I was 18-19. She started having symptoms when I was 16. We have no idea what caused it, not in the family or anything.

She’s currently in the hospital, she’s been in and out for a while but this time they said she isn’t coming home. She isn’t eating, she’s very weak and tired, she’s going to pass soon..

For context:
I lived with her, my dad, and my sister who is 22. My dad was abusive, I left home when I was 18 and then cut contact when I was 20 because my dad was stalking me and sending me horrible texts and voicemails. I felt so bad leaving my mom and sister behind. The rest of my family is very small and we don’t talk at all, nor did they keep in touch with my mom since I left.
I knew she had dementia, when I left home, she was unable to do the usual things like draw a clock, tell the date/time, tell who the president was, etc. My mom was still physically the same when I left, but she wasn’t fully present mentally. On the day I decided I was gonna cut contact, I visited home one last time while my dad wasn’t there, so I could grab a few things. When I left, my mom followed me out to say bye, she said we should go out sometime to get coffee. I hugged her and told her I loved her, (we didn’t do that much.) She said she loved me back, and then I left. 

I had no idea of my mom’s worsening condition until my sister found a way to get ahold of me last year. She declined a lot, lost weight, barely talks, unstable on her feet, unable to control her bladder/bowels, etc. She sent me a picture of her, my mom looks nothing like how I last saw her, I was devastated. My sister and I have been in touch since, and she had not told my dad that we are in touch again.

As I mentioned above, she’s in the hospital. Her dementia is shutting her body down, it mainly affected her digestive system, so she was in and out frequently for a while so they could take care of her. This time nothings working, they put her on hospice and are just focusing on comfort care. I’m inconsolable. They don’t know how much time she has, but the fact that she won’t eat or drink tells me it may be soon. I haven’t seen her in 4 years because of my dad. The guilt of leaving her behind is eating me alive. I want to see her one last time in hopes that my presence would make her happy. I have no idea if she’ll remember me or miss me or anything, all I want to do is comfort her and tell her how sorry I am. I wanna see her smile again even if she isn’t all there. I wanna hug her and talk to her and watch tv with her. My sister thinks I could try to go see her tomorrow after she and my dad leave, that way she can tell me where my dad is so I know he won’t just randomly show up while I’m there. 

I’m not prepared to see her, but something is making me do it. I feel I will never forgive myself if I don’t at least try to see her again. I hope it’s good closure for the both of us.. I just don’t think I’ll ever be ready to see her like this. I have no idea how she will react or if she will be happy. My sister doesn’t think she will react negatively. 

I just can’t believe this is it.. my mom is dying. She could pass as soon as tonight, I can’t relax, I can’t think straight. I’m going through all the stages of grief at once. I’m in denial, I can’t stop crying when I think of her, I’m so mad that this is happening to her, I just want her back so badly. I’m only 24, I’ll never be able to have her with me in the future. She’ll never be there for me when I need her most, when/if I decide to get married and have kids, or get a house, or anything. I can’t just call her up on a random day and invite her over for coffee. She’s never coming back. And on top of it all, I feel so terrible and guilty for leaving her. ",1,1733551000.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

When very irritated I feel tingling numbness in my pinky and ring finger tips. I have had an X-ray, MRI of the wrist, MRI of the arm, EMG, nerve conduction study all come out as normal. Had nerve hydrodissection which only caused more pain. Had dextrose prolotherapy which did not improve anything. Did physical therapy twice which only worsened the pain.

My ketone and sugar is amazing YAY 

In Japan the blood pressure log books (and app) want you to measure twice and log the average.  Why don't they do this in the USA?  The 2nd measurement is 99% of the time lower.  Just because you are sitting calmly.  I included a photo from the Japanese blood pressure app I use, and no it doesn't support other languages.  Depending on how much difference there is I sometimes take a 3rd measurement.  The average is what I log into other apps like fitness tracker and a USA BP app with better visuals.  


BIG PROBLEM /UNKNOWN 

I was fine all day Thursday until I went to bed.  My right hip HURT.  The bones hurt.  Enough to interfere with sleep.  It only hurts when I lay down.  So ...  is autophagy repairing something in my hip bone?  Is calcium needed somewhere else and being taken from the hip bone?  🤷🏼‍♀️  I honestly have no idea but it's easy to say I need calcium.  Bones need calcium, and vitamin D. 


So I might as well take everything.  And with that many pills I definitely want food to help with digestion.  Fat soluble pills need fat so a cheese omelette works perfect.  (yes I used a scale to weigh stuff)  In the evening after walking I took another calcium magnesium zinc combo pill.  For only one pill and recently eating I didn't feel food was necessary.  (Saturday ketone at 9.0 and BG at 85 so no damage done) 


Yes it helped.  I was only slightly aching when I went to bed.  My plan was to go to the bone doctor Saturday morning.  Saturday morning it hurt more and THIS Saturday the bone doctor is closed.  Ugh  (So more food and pills on day 7)  Because it hurt again by morning but not much at night I'm guessing I need calcium for some kind of repairs.  So I will eat breakfast to take vitamins for a few days to help my body = give it more building blocks to work with. 


Friday I exercised twice.  In the afternoon I went outside and logged as functional training.  I have jumpers knee and something that really helps is sideways and backward walking.  There's a parking lot next door so that was my walking area.  I walked sideways across then did torso twists, returned and did windmills.  I made 6 trips and did some calisthenics at each end.  Simple and easy but very beneficial.  In the evening I walked through downtown playing Pokemon Go with my husband.  (after we did 2 teacup raids 😉) ",1,1733550883.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1h8lvxk,https://i.redd.it/7os0us2q7d5e1.jpeg,Can I measure the performance of motion design ads?,"Did That Ad Just Move… or Was It My Coffee?""
Alright, folks, we’ve all been there. Scrolling through social media, minding our own business, and BAM! A beautifully animated ad slides onto the screen like it owns the place. Motion design ads are like that one friend who knows how to make an entrance—they grab attention before you even know what's happening. But how do we know if they’re actually doing their job? Because, spoiler alert: ""Looks cool"" doesn’t pay the bills!


---

📈 ""Impressions Are Like First Dates… Metrics Are the Real Relationship!""
Let’s talk performance tracking, shall we? You think your animation is amazing? Great! But does the audience agree? Enter CTR (click-through rate)—the gold standard of motion design ads. It’s like the ad equivalent of asking, “Did they call you back?” The more clicks, the better your ad is doing at saying, “Hey, look at me!” And if no one's clicking? Well, that’s the ad-world version of being ghosted.


---

⏱ ""Watch Time: The Netflix Test for Your Ad!""
Watch time is the secret sauce, people! It’s not just about if they clicked; it’s about how long they stayed. Did your 3D animation keep them glued for 10 seconds or have them bailing in two? Watch time is like the friend who shows up to your party and actually stays for dessert. If they’re sticking around, you’re doing something right.


---

🛒 ""Conversions: Because Pretty Animations Don’t Pay Rent!""
Clicks and watch time are great, but let’s be real—conversions are the MVP of motion design ads. Did they add to cart? Download the app? Sign up for that newsletter they’ll never read? Measuring conversions is where you find out if your masterpiece didn’t just entertain—it SOLD. After all, an ad’s job is to get that ka-ching sound going.


---

💡 ""A/B Testing: The Battle of the Animations!""
Here’s a pro tip: when in doubt, let your ads duke it out. A/B testing is like a boxing match for your animations. You put two designs in the ring, and only one emerges victorious. Maybe that slow fade-out wasn’t as sexy as you thought, or perhaps the kinetic typography hit harder than a Marvel trailer. Either way, numbers don’t lie.


---

🎩 ""The ROI Rabbit Hole!""
Let’s dive into the magical land of ROI (return on investment). Tracking ROI from motion design ads is like figuring out if the magician’s trick was worth the ticket price. Did your $500 animation bring back $5,000 in sales? Or just a “Thanks, but no thanks”? ROI is the ultimate way to see if your fancy visuals are as profitable as they are pretty.


---

🎉 ""Conclusion: Motion Design Ads Are the Beyoncé of Marketing!""
Let’s face it: motion design ads are the showstoppers of the marketing world. They grab attention, hold it hostage, and sometimes even make people open their wallets. But measuring their performance? That’s the cherry on top. So, remember: track those metrics, A/B test like a scientist, and always—ALWAYS—celebrate your wins.

Now go forth and animate like your ROI depends on it. Because spoiler: it does!

1h8lts2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusLegal/comments/1h8lts2/employment_offer_withdrawn_after_a_week_of_working/,Employment offer “withdrawn” after a week of working,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some outside perspectives on my current situation.

I’ve been looking for casual/part-time roles in hospitality here in Victoria for a while with some difficulty in landing a position.

It’s currently a very competitive market, and I’ve extensive hospitality experience. But from 2019-2024 I was focussing on a career in the finance industry. But prior to that and since 2009 I was in hospo in various environments.

A couple weeks back I applied for a place I was really interested in, I went in to interview, and a week later I was contacted to advise I had landed the role along with another applicant. The weeks shifts would be split between the two of us and the hours I’d be getting as a result were totally suitable for me.

I was asked to come in for a trial shift on the Monday to prove my technical skills. After this trial shift I was given $20 cash and told everything was great and up to standard and that I’d be commencing straight away and given shifts for the week.

I worked the full 4 shifts for that week. Consistently checking in with how they thought I was doing. Asking for feedback. Seeking out impressions of the coffees I was presenting. I’ve been in this industry a long time so I know how to adjust a machine if the shots are off. But taste tells us a lot as well so checking for taste was done with other staff and management. And again I was consistently being told it was great. The other staff member they decided to hire was less experienced and fairly recently out of high school so I also helped her with technique on the machine and taught her… well a few fundamentals that really should have been taught by existing staff or brought as part of her existing experience.

Out of the blue the day after my last shift I was contacted by the owner who out of nowhere told me she has decided to withdraw the offer of employment after already confirming I had landed the role.

I asked why this decision was made, and I was told that my technical skills weren’t where they needed to be.

The problem with this reasoning is that not a single member of the staff knew anything about calibration or correct use of the machine. Not when or how to clean the machines. They knew next to nothing and were not able to explain a single standard process to me.
I was also told the drinks I was making were excellent consistently. I was taking initiative, staying a little overtime to do a little extra cleaning which was not expected of me. Pouring silky latte art. The whole works.

I was also told I took their feedback poorly - a statement which is a categorical fib. I would ask for feedback, and when I wasn’t given a few grunts or short sentences like “yeah you’re doing great” I was given no feedback. So I’m upset that such an assessment of my character can be made without any grounds for this.

And I have not been paid for the shifts I worked.

So I guess I’m wanting to know, does this appear to be a breach of any fair work laws or wrong doing? I was told I had the role not that this was a whole trial week. And I wasn’t told there was only 1 position I was told there were 2. And that us two candidates landed those roles.

I’m desperate for the work and I work really hard. And I take small business seriously. If there were feedback I could integrate, I would love this. But I messaged a very respectable message to the owner asking for details or specifics on my suitability - the response was that the message was accidentally deleted but if I send the message again she would absolutely respond because she thought the questions were fair.

TLDR: was told I got a job after a trial shift. After a week of working, I was told the offer for employment (that had already commenced) was withdrawn but no specific reason was given. Wages were not paid. Can I do something about this?",1,1733550279.0,AusLegal,12,1.0,False

Basically the cafe I work at uses a super local dairy farms milk, it's great and all, but due to the ""season change"" there's a way lower protein content in the milk, thus it's frothing like absolute crap. Like when I say it's bad, I mean it's really bad.

All day today I wanted to just bang my head against the wall, even if I sit there and incorporate air into the milk almost the ENTIRE time, I'll end up with either straight bubbles or enough foam for a flat white. In addition to that, it's just continuously screeching, with the very minimal foam that's there give it 10 seconds and it's just pure screech. I genuinely don't even want to serve  the coffee, I feel embarrassed to. There's barely any latte art potential too. 

I have tried everything I could think of to try and fix/help it. Now I'm not a professionally trained Barista, I taught myself basics about a year ago and have come a LONG way. So there could be something I'm missing, I could be doing something wrong, who knows, hence why I'm here.

Right now, my intention is to do the three tops with a poly or something very durable and do the rest of the table with an easier to apply finish like tung oil. 

So my questions are can I do a polyurethane for a table top and an oil for the rest of the table?

Underrated?,"So me and my girl have talked about CDO being underrated, unlike Baguio, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and even the Municipality of La Union which are well-promoted and popular among many. We often see these cities on social media and travel choices, but less to never when it comes to CDO. CDO is a progressive major city but we barely get mentioned. Are we too quiet? Too humble?

**Cebu** has been known for their tourist spots, city life, Visayan pop (Vispop) and career opportunities. **Baguio**, mainly for tourism, filming locations, temperature and what, strawberries? **Iloilo** for their historical spots and gastronomy (Hello *Batchoy* lovers!) and finally **Davao**, being the big one in Mindanao. It even got more popular after the Ds had their first national reign. Labels like ""safe"" and ""clean"" seem to have effectively caught every investor's interest which explains the southern boom.

Cagayan de Oro, on the other hand, despite being known for its urbanization and northern boom barely gets a scene on the media. Perhaps, rafting isn't everyone's cup of tea, myself included. TJ Monterde and Arthur Nery are, undeniably, doing well in their music craft. But is *Palagi* and *Pagsamo* really enough? Really though, I want to thank Jonaxx for promoting the city well (alongside neighboring Bukidnon) through her Wattpad stories. But are the *Montefalcos* also enough? However, I do agree that CDO doesn't focus much on tourism. It's more on business, commerce and hospitality.

Camiguin's Vjandep Pastel doesn't come from us but we associate with it. Seven Seas is located in Opol but we also associate with it. Don't get me wrong, we're definitely managing these very well and that's exactly why CDO is also known for both these two.

If you don't know, it's a fantastic teahouse off Monroe/Northwest Blvd.

Was just there tonight, first time and we had the Saguaro Chai (pepper tea), Orange-Spice Rooibos, and the Tranquilitea. Saguaro Chai was my favorite, but their entire tea menu looks amazing.

Great blends, great staff, great atmosphere, just a generally great place to go spend some time with someone(s).

Can't recommend enough.

When all the options out there seem to be burnt coffee, milkshakes, burnt coffee milkshakes, or IPAs, having a chill, passionately looked after teahouse here in Spokane in winter has been a godsend.

Five years ago I’d have wanted this whirlwind romance, crazy ups and downs… but came here to say sometimes the average days in an average marriage are the best. 

Today for example; it’s December, we’ve been through a lot this year. Lots of tears and arguments, big huge wins, laughter, tight times and amazing times. 

Today we both worked from the time the sun came up (both in management level sales roles), it was 38 degrees Fahrenheit where we live so I stayed curled up in bed a bit longer while he got up and going. I was still asleep ish at 7am when he left with a shouted goodbye, and then I rolled out of bed to start feeding the dogs and schooching their butts onto a frosty lawn to do their business. We checked in with each other a few times via phone, chit chatted about family plans for the weekend, I moaned how tired I was on my second coffee and he grouched how his favorite restaurant switched to Pepsi instead of Coke. First world stuff. 

We wrapped up at 4:30, both sat in traffic ten miles away from each other, he hit the gym while I went home to take a walk for some fresh crispy air. We both ignored the piles of laundry in our faces, then heated up leftovers and went to see a movie with his parents (superrr sexy date night lol). Dishes in the sink, he’s playing some video games now as I prep for bed. I’ll probably lie down by him on the couch and ingloriously pass out (skincare routine done though). And it’ll be my favorite thing I’ve done this week.

In a world where digital currencies reign supreme and cash is slowly becoming as ancient as hieroglyphics, **Bitcoin ATMs** have emerged as the bridge between old-school money and the shiny, decentralized future. These machines, conveniently placed in coffee shops, gas stations, and even your favorite local pizza joint, are the gateways to cryptocurrency bliss. And guess what? With our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** (https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), they’re about to get even more magical.

# What is a Bitcoin ATM, Anyway?

Let’s start with the basics. A Bitcoin ATM (or BATM, if you’re feeling fancy) is a kiosk that lets you buy Bitcoin using cash or, in some cases, sell Bitcoin for cash. Think of it as the ultimate vending machine—not for snacks or sodas but for digital gold.

Unlike traditional ATMs, which are tied to a specific bank, Bitcoin ATMs connect to the blockchain. This means they’re not bound by pesky banking hours or complicated bureaucracy. Need Bitcoin at 3 AM while grabbing a midnight snack? A Bitcoin ATM has your back.

# The QR Code Connection: Why It Matters

Enter the humble QR code—a small, scannable matrix that makes crypto transactions fast, accurate, and hassle-free. Every Bitcoin ATM uses QR codes to link your wallet to the machine. Without QR codes, these ATMs would feel like something out of the Stone Age.

That’s where our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** comes in. Whether you’re using Bitcoin ATMs for personal transactions or setting one up for your business, our app simplifies the process by generating clean, error-free QR codes in seconds. It’s like handing a wizard their wand—you’re about to make magic happen.

# Why Bitcoin ATMs Are Taking Over the World

# 1. Accessibility for Everyone

Not everyone is tech-savvy or trusts online exchanges. Bitcoin ATMs provide a tangible, user-friendly way to interact with crypto. Got cash in hand? Feed it into the machine, scan your wallet’s QR code, and voilà—you’re a proud Bitcoin owner.

# 2. Anonymity is Key

Bitcoin ATMs often allow users to make small transactions without the need for extensive identity verification. While regulations vary by country, this feature makes ATMs appealing to privacy-conscious individuals.

# 3. Speedy Transactions

Compared to traditional exchanges, which may take hours or even days to process transactions, Bitcoin ATMs are instant. You walk in with cash, and you walk out with Bitcoin in your wallet.

# 4. Global Adoption

From Tokyo to Timbuktu, Bitcoin ATMs are popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. As of today, there are tens of thousands worldwide, and the numbers are only growing.

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Elevates the Experience

Bitcoin ATMs may be cool, but they’re not immune to the occasional hiccup. Misentered wallet addresses? Awkward delays? Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** eliminates these issues by making transactions as smooth as silk.

# 1. Create QR Codes in Seconds

Got a Bitcoin wallet address? Paste it into our app, hit generate, and boom—a QR code ready to scan. No more fumbling with long, clunky addresses.

# 2. Customizable for Businesses

Running a Bitcoin ATM business? Add your logo, brand colors, or custom designs to your QR codes. It’s not just functional; it’s a marketing opportunity.

# 3. Error-Free Transactions

Our app uses advanced encoding techniques to ensure every QR code is accurate and scannable. Say goodbye to failed transactions and frustrated customers.

# 4. Totally Free to Use

Why pay for QR code generation when you can do it for free? Our app is fast, efficient, and doesn’t cost a single satoshi.

# Adventures with Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

# Scenario 1: The Traveler’s Dream

You’re in a foreign country, your fiat currency is running low, and all you’ve got is Bitcoin. No problem! Find a Bitcoin ATM, scan your QR code, and withdraw local cash. It’s the ultimate travel hack for crypto enthusiasts.

# Scenario 2: The Business Opportunity

Imagine owning a Bitcoin ATM in a busy urban area. With our QR code maker app, you can brand your machine’s interface, offer seamless transactions, and attract more customers. Plus, the passive income from transaction fees? Chef’s kiss.

# Scenario 3: The Tech-Savvy Shopper

Your local cafe now accepts Bitcoin, and the barista points to a QR code at the counter. You scan it with your wallet app, pay in Bitcoin, and sip your latte knowing you’re living in the future.

# Fun Facts About Bitcoin ATMs

* **They’re Everywhere**: The United States leads the pack with the most Bitcoin ATMs, followed by Canada and Europe.
* **Bitcoin Isn’t the Only Option**: Many ATMs now support other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, and even Dogecoin.
* **The Fees Vary**: Transaction fees can range from 5% to 10%. While higher than online exchanges, the convenience is worth it for many users.
* **They’re Built for Speed**: Most transactions take less than a minute to complete.

# Building a Future with Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes

The rise of Bitcoin ATMs signals a broader trend: cryptocurrency is becoming mainstream. As more people adopt Bitcoin, the demand for user-friendly, reliable tools will skyrocket. QR codes are the unsung heroes of this movement, making transactions accessible to everyone from seasoned traders to first-time users.

Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** is your ally in this journey. Whether you’re buying Bitcoin, running an ATM, or building your own crypto empire, our app ensures you’re equipped with the best tools in the game.

# Conclusion: The Perfect Pairing

Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes go together like peanut butter and jelly, pizza and pineapple (yes, we said it), or Bitcoin and the blockchain. Together, they’re transforming how the world interacts with money.

With our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** (https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), you’re not just participating in the revolution—you’re leading it. So go ahead, visit your nearest Bitcoin ATM, generate that QR code, and embrace the future. It’s going to be a wild, exciting ride. 🚀",1,1733549330.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

 I'm bi and have only been with women. I have been sexualy intimate with woman but still a virgin. I'm 28.

This gorgeous guy and I spoke on grindr for 6 hours straight first time. Then we connected on Instagram. He Sends 8 messages flirting and asking how I'm doing from the first message.  

MAIN PART

He's a bottom. I am technically versatile but only get tops wanting me so defaulted to a bottom. I don't think he knows. I am very masculine and technically wish I was a top. 

 I would love to top him but I have a 4 inch penis. He's also 6'3. I am 5'1. And a virgin.

He's Model Status i mean unbelievably gorgeous. I'm just average. I know i bring a lot to the table in terms of personality and other aspects  Height never bothered me. But...combine all that with being below average it's a killer.

I just don't know how to go out with a guy. I need a plan. Where to go. What to do. 

I  ever went on dates with men. How to do it. I dont know whether to shake hands, hug when we meet. I end up friend zoning them or being too professional. I'm not like that with girls. I  hate it. But I am ready. I want to push myself out of this comfort zone. I guess it's also because I don't know what role to play. I'm very masculine but very empathetic person and super comfortable with emotions. 


I also don't like to play games and wait forever. I am crushing real hard for this boy. Haven't felt this way in a long time.

He is only 1 year older than me and is incredibly hot and we get along SO WELL. Every time I go in, we end up getting sidetracked because we start talking about our lives instead of what I came in to see him for. I could go on and on about all the things I like about this guy. He is incredibly smart and funny and I feel like I have known him forever. He is NOT my gynecologist or my shrink (two things I know I would be asking right away).

Of course I know all the many, many reasons this is stupid. We are both HAPPILY married. We both love our kids and wouldn't want to screw up their lives. I would NEVER want him to lose his license and, because he is really, really good at his job and I badly need his expertise (he is a specialist and I saw TONS of specialists before him who couldn't make me any better, but he has), I would never want to switch doctors. And even though we get along great as friends, I go back and forth on whether he is even attracted to me or just a really nice guy. I think it is probably the latter. 

But I CANNOT stop thinking about him.  I rehearse different conversations with him in my head, trying to figure out what I should say and then what he might say next. Like, I badly want to spend more time just TALKING with him, because he is fun and we get along, and I'd really like to ask him for coffee after work or over his lunch hour or something, so I keep trying to convince myself that this is ALL it is (because that is not something he can get in trouble for if that's all it is), so then I think of different ways to ask if we can just hang out. I try to aim for ""so blunt that I take you by surprise and make you laugh/smile/blush/all of the above"", and thus far I keep coming back to ""You realize that every straight woman in this building would sleep with you if you asked her, right? But it's been 12 years, and I'm pretty darn sure you aren't asking, and I'm fine with that, so if I ask you to grab coffee with me, can you trust me when I say that's all I'm asking? "" It certainly sounds like me when I write it down (in that it sounds blunt, confusing, and awkward) but then I wonder if maybe I should try to say something that doesn't sound like such a mess for a change. Or if I should just keep saying nothing and wondering what kissing him would be like. Sigh.

If you're going to ask, I would hope very much that if we could hang out, that would be enough and I wouldn't feel the need to DO anything, because of the many reasons listed, and I doubt it would be up to me anyway. I don't think I would be able to say no if he tried something, but I highly doubt that would ever happen.",1,1733549091.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

New Killer: The Smile
Name: Unknown
Gender: Unknown
Origin: Unknown
Power: Death Curse
Movement Speed: 115%
Terror Radius: Medium
Height: Average
Difficulty Ranking: Intermediate

Appearance:
The Smile appears as Skye Riley, the default costume being her after the car crash that killed her boyfriend, with a crutch being her weapon.
In her killer portrait, it does no pose, it simply stares straight at the camera with a dead eyed smile.

Cosmetics:

Like the Legion, The Smile has multiple different people be part of its cosmetics.

- Skye’s outfit from the end of the movie, with a microphone being her weapon.
- Skye’s outfit when she arrived to Morris near the end of the film. With a shard of glass as her weapon
- Lewis Frugoli from the second film, with a barbell weight as his weapon
- Laura Weaver from the “Laura hasn’t slept” short film, with a shard of broken plant pot as a weapon
- Rose Cotter from the first film, with a knife as a weapon
Additionally, if you get the chapter bundle. You get special head cosmetics for The Huntress,  The Wraith, The Clown, The Trickster and The Houndmaster where they all have the smile.


Power
Death Curse

For the entire trial, The Smile is able to transmit the curse (use left trigger on console, e on keyboard). When the trial begins, no survivors are cursed.
When transmitting the curse, The Smile uses their weapon to kill themselves. (unique animation for each weapon) Afterwards, The Smile reforms somewhere else in the trial grounds. If a survivor is within 20 meters of The Smile while they transmit the curse, they become cursed. Only one survivor can be cursed at a time. The Smile can transmit the curse to survivors even if they are hooked or downed. 

Cursed survivors have a timer counting down from 1 minute, which appears as a smile underneath their character icon that slowly fills with blood (only the cursed one sees this). The timer pauses when a survivor is hooked or downed. When the 1 minute is up, the cursed survivor stops what they’re doing, smiles, and snaps their own neck. Killing them instantly, regardless of their hook state. Any survivor within 20 meters of them when they die is the next to become cursed. 

When a survivor is cursed, they become vulnerable to the manipulation of The Smile.

Special Attack: Flashbacks

When a survivor is cursed, hold the active ability button to trigger a flashback on the cursed survivor.
A flashback will suddenly appear on the cursed survivors screen, obscuring their vision for a brief period. (Flashback is unique for each survivor, mostly snapshots of tome lore cutscenes.) At the end of the flashback, the survivor screams and any survivor within 20 meters of them are revealed via killer instinct for 3 seconds. Then this ability goes on cooldown for 20 seconds.

Special Attack: Smiling Illusions

Press the active ability button (Right trigger on console or Q on Keyboard) to use the smiling illusions. A random number of survivors in the trial (except for 0) will smile and look directly towards the cursed survivor. This is only able to be seen by the cursed survivor. When the cursed survivor is within 6 meters of their smiling teammates, they’ll scream and reveal their location. Additionally, 10 seconds will be removed from the curse timer immediately. This lasts for 15 seconds and has a 20 second cooldown. 

Special Interaction: Removing the Curse

There is one way for survivors to rid themselves of the curse. They must achieve an “Unaltruistic Actuon” event. A unique score event for The Smile only. Unaltruistic actions are performed when a survivor intentionally sabotages another. For example

- Messing up skill checks on cooperative actions (generators or healing)
- Blocking the way of a survivor who is being chased by The Smile.
- Performing a fast action when not in The Smiles terror radius

If an Unaltruistic action is achieved, the nearest survivor to witness it will receive the curse and the cursed survivor will no longer be cursed. Additionally, the curse timer resets. 


Perks

Inescapable 

They can try to stop you. But their plans will always fall to ruin. Anything they think of, you have already planned for.

When a survivor is unhooked or recovers from the dying state, their aura is revealed to you for 3/4/5 seconds.

“You can’t escape your own mind, Rose.” - The Smile



Brutal Illusions

You cast illusions on your prey that disturb greatly when they are found to not be real.

At the beginning of the trial, 1-2-3 fake generators will spawn. When they reach 50% repair progress, they disappear.

“This isn’t real, Skye.” - The Smile



Hex: Blood on White Satin

A Hex that makes others abandon safety, as there is no safety with you.

One totem in the trial becomes a hex totem. A hex totems effect persists until cleansed or blessed.
When a survivor leaves a dropped pallet 15-10-5 meters away, this hex takes effect on it. When a survivor comes within 5 meters of an affected pallet, it instantly breaks.

“You’re not in control, Skye. I am.” - The Smile



Mori:
The survivor turns on the ground and jumps in horror. The Smile is no longer taking the form of Skye. It is now them. It continues its Smile as it rips off its own head and the true form of the demon crawls out. It grabs their head and opens their mouth until it starts to split open. The camera zooms in on the opened mouth and goes to black. Shortly, it comes back to the survivor now smiling into the camera.
For the rest of the trial, The Smile takes the form of that survivor.

Syringe of Adrenaline

She believed it would help her, but in truth, it was all a lie.

Cursed survivors are in deep wound whenever they are injured.


Skye’s Phone

She was apparently texting an unknown number.

When an unaltruistic action passes on the curse, the cursed survivor and the non-cursed one scream.


Purple


Burnt Match

The one thing that set Rose alight as she smiled even in death.

Cursed survivors are broken for as long as they are cursed.

“Your mind is what makes it real” - The Smile


Smiling Paintings

One of many paintings of a horrific smiling shadow.

When Flashbacks are performed, a random un-cursed survivor suffers from it as well as the cursed one.

“Twenty-five years of marriage and that's what I have left to remember him.” - Victoria Munoz


Bloodied Weight

The weight Lewis used to pass on the curse.

When a survivor passes on the curse, every second survivor to get it will have half the time to pass it on.

“I’ve been experience some seriously freaky shit, man!” - Lewis Frugoli


Gemma’s Coffee

She seemed so real to Skye, but it all came crashing down.

When Smiling Illusions are used, 4 extra survivors will appear to the cursed survivor and will disappear when they cause them to scream.

“Gemma hates you, Skye” - The Smile


Iridescent

Smiling Dwight

A severed, smiling head of Dwight Fairfield. A twisted gift from the Entity itself to The Smile.

Multiple false generators, totems, pallets and chests will spawn to a cursed survivor. If they are interacted with, a smiling face appears on screen and the survivor screams, making their timer progress go down by 10 seconds.


Bloody Microphone

The whole crowd watched in horror as Skye bludgeoned herself to death.

Two survivors can now be cursed at a time instead of just one.

“Break a leg out there” - The Smile


Additional Tidbits

- The arms of The Smiles true form will appear when breaking a breakable wall.
- Other survivors witnessing the mori will only see their teammate scream and start choking, then get up and smile.
- Each unique weapon will have unique cooldown animations.
- When stunned, The Smile lets out a part of the cry from Skye when she discovered Paul’s body.
- When vaulting, the Smile doesn’t use their hands and simply steps over the vault. Similar to when it took the form of Rose’s therapist.
- The Menu Theme for the Smile will be the ending credits theme for Smile 2 (would recommend you listen to it if you haven’t!)

Hi! Who’s free and wants to watch a movie with me tonight? Let’s watch the last full show of Wicked or Gladiator II in Evia, Nomo or Alabang, and maybe coffee after? KKB. This is purely SFW and getting-to-know-you. I’m in that age when titas and lolas keep bugging me about dating and marriage 😅 And come to think of it, it’s super fun to be sharing life with someone. I’m taking my chance here but let’s start slow, so, movie anyone?

About me
- Age: 36
- Fun-sized
- On the heavy side with curves on the right places and seriously working on it. Hopefully this is not too important to you.
- Professional and very passionate about my career
- Kids: None but want them
- Low to moderate maintenance
- Manila and southie girl
- Maraming sabaw and funny moments especially wh en with friends. I don’t take myself too seriously but I know when to get serious.
- Life of the party with friends but actually an introvert
- Street-smart
- I have 3 cats who are my world; animal lover but…
- Not vegan
- I love singing, watching movies/concerts/plays/musicals (hence, the invitation for a movie date), star-gazing, travelling, spending time with my family, new adventures, and roadtrips.

About you
- Age: No strict age limit as long as you’re ready to settle down mentally, emotionally, and financially if this goes well.
- No baggages and walang sabit (no wife, no girlfriend; I’m not into open relationships)
- No height requirement 😅 basta taller than me so maybe 5ft or above
- Religion: Catholic sana (nothing against other religions but just don’t make me convert); I value spirituality more than being religious but I also don’t want complications because being Catholic is important to me and my family.
- Family person
- Has a good sense of humor; can keep up with sabaw or serious conversations (in short, makwento, makulit, and doesn’t take himself too seriosly as well)
- Values good governance
- Passionate for the things you love and like. 
- Ready to be introduced to family and friends if this goes well
- Kaladkarin 😅 Values quality time together.
- Preferably from the south/Metro Manila, or has a car or at least knows how to drive. I’m not materialistic but let me be real, sawa na ko maging driver for the nth time for my exes, especially if semi-LDR. We can take turns driving.
- Non-negotiable: Cat and all kinds of animal lover

They say don’t look for love and it will come to you. I have been waiting, universe. Hahahahha what’s a 36yo girl to do? 😂 Anyway, if this doesn’t work out, at least we were able to see a movie. 🙂",3,1733548930.0,PHR4RCaviteEtivac,0,1.0,False

I don't like to drink caffeine at night it keeps me up.  My variety pack had 3 Coffee Stouts in them.  Do they have caffeine?

I googled it, but getting lots of mixed answers.  Some say coffee beers have as much as a cup of coffee and others say there is hardly any.  Some even say it's illegal for coffee beers to have caffeine (in the USA), while others say it's legal if it comes from natural sources.  

I found a beer forum and there was like 12 pages of self proclaimed beer nerds hotly debating it, lol

The beer in question is ""Summit Blonde Ale Brewed with Bizzy Cold Brew"".  Neither their cans, box nor website lists caffeine contents.  Is that assumed to be none or just an unknown amount ?

0.5 oz Mr. Black coffee liqueur
1 tsp Dolin sweet vermouth
1 tsp rich demerara syrup
2 dashes Fee Brothers chocolate bitters

Stir & strain, no garnish

The specs intrigued me, so I had to give it a try. Per the main thread's suggestion, I added a spoonful of syrup since I'm using Mr. Black, which definitely seems to smooth things out. The change in flavor over the course of each sip is interesting: at first, the syrup and coffee hit. Then the old smoky taste of the scotch comes roaring in. What lingers is the chocolate and just a shade of vermouth.

It's an odd one for sure. Not something I'd want on a regular basis, but I can see myself having a hankering for this specific combo of flavors on occasion. I do think the vermouth gets a little lost. Maybe it could use more, or just a different vermouth.

While growing up, I made sure to constantly repeat to my parents (28F) and (28M), my cousins and uncles, who all just happen to be in the same age range as us, that I want to name future resurrected pterodactyl Bob, be a I loved watching Bob the Builder. I was just so fascinated by that show, and I wanted my future pterodactyl pet to have the bame of someone I looked up to.

My sis of course, being the other same aged woman who somehow in this incident is so against my every single wish, was just smirking at me, rolling her eyes and then rolling down the street like a bowling ball because, I forgot to mention that she is also fat and divorced and horrendous, to grab her basic b*tch iced latte from Starfunks. I just kept ignoring her dismissals, as her being petty and illogical and just a woman around my age.

Well, one month ago, one of my besties Val (28F), who is the ONLY logical female of my age range I ever met, just so happens to be a molecular biologist and genetist in Harvard University (did I mention she is also hot and we have a history and oh no, this is a story for another day teehee), told me something important, while drinking non-basic b*tch coffee at a local patisserie because we are so not basic.

Well, she informed me that my request for resurrecting genetically a pterodactyl was approved by a bunch of scientists, and in 6 months, I will have at home my very own pterodactyl pet Bob!

I was screaming in joy, hugging my bestie, and thanking her profusely by asking her if she wants a polyamorous relationship with me, my future wife Linda (28F) and the army of other women and men I am dating,  because, gosh, I am such a popular male guy dude (they are all 28 btw). Well, she said yes! 

We went to visit immediately my patents, calling all my future side spouses and my main spouse Linda. My parents were overjoyed for both adding another relationship to my collection and for soon having a pet pterodactyl. My sister, of course, just  so happened to join us by accident, still rolling her eyes from our last conversation 5 months ago. With her, were our cousins Alisha (28F) and Amy (28F, you know the drill). Karen had just come out of the hospital. She had given birth to a set of twins males. Well, she had put a name tag on each to not confuse them, because that's what you do to your twins to not confuse them. 

When I went to congratulate her coming out of the hospital 3 hours after giving birth to my nephews, I noticed their name tags, and I was horrified, flabbergasted and horrified (did I say horrified?). She named my first nephew (28M) Bob and my second as Bobby (28M). 

I looked at my sister in her eyes, for which I had to climb up the stairs for, since her eyes were still rolled up. She was smirking, and then she told me how happy she was for naming her sons such extravagantly awesome and authentic names. She always knew Bob was taken for my future pet, and I knew she just wanted to rile me up, because that's what males so easily do.

Then our cousins chipped in the conversation, when I told them about my future pterodactyl pet and my plans to name him Bob. They just laughed at me for wanting to name my pet after my nephews and how weird it was.

In that moment, I just erupted like a volcano of rage, and told my sister she knew that the name Bob, which is so rare and popular, was taken and I knew that she named her sons like that on purpose. We started screaming at each other, her blaming me for divorcing her husband because he fell in love with me 1 week before she gave birth. I stormed out of the house with my army of lovers, making sure to threaten my sister that either she names her sons another rare cool name like Bill or Batman, or I am uninviting her from my wedding in 1 month (did I mention my sister is fat, ugly and still rolling her eyes and smirking?).

Now, my family and friends are divided. My father, my friends and my army of relationships are on my side, because they also knew my love for the name Bob. My mother and female cousins chose to  take my sister's side because they are 28 year old females with no brains.  They blew up my phone with a satellite cannon, called me every name in the book and told me I am illogical and I overreacted. I think this is just an elaborate ruse to justify their bigotry because of my polyamorous relationships and that I have used all out family's money to resurrect a pterodactyl (oops). 

So Reddit, am I the AH?

Note: This is a shitpost and is based on a similar story I read a while ago. Although having a pet pterodactyl sounds cool af.

1.) Find your place: It's doesn't have to be somewhere far, or crowded, or extravagant. Just a place nearby you can go, where you say ""I like this place."" and just go sit there for a while. I recommend places like lakes, parks, nature in general if you have the luxury. 

2.) Integrate it into whatever routine you may have.: I know people who have mental health issues struggle with routine, but making your little trip as necessary to your routine as brushing your teeth helps a lot. 

3.)Stay for as long or as little as you like.: You made it, you accomplished the goal. If you feel uncomfortable, you can leave right away. If you want to take in your spot, chill there! 

4.) Treat yourself and recover.: You're home again, take a moment and recover. Now get yourself a treat of some kind, positive re-enforcement for yourself. For me that's usually a coffee. 

These may all sound trivial, but these really helped me get out every day. Test it out and see how you feel. Don't disparage yourself when you don't get out, pat yourself on that back for getting out. ",1,1733548080.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

We are in a 3-year Long Distance Relationship po. We spend time together every time we have a chance mag file ng leave. Gusto ko lang magkwento at makahingi na rin ng advice po.

Is it normal po ba na ma-upset everytime may labas or hang out yung bf ko with his work friends? Nagsasabi naman sya sakin. Sinasabi nya rin kung sino kasama nya. Pero still I feel upset. Hindi rin ako makatulog hanggat di sya nakakauwi. Lagi kami nag aaway sa ganito. Kasi papayag naman ako pag nagpaalam sya, pero after ng hang out nila I'll act cold kasi I feel upset. I understand may life sya outside our relationship, kaya pumayag ako. but I can't help na maging upset pa rin after lalo na pag I feel so lonely at night kasi wala ako makausap (like we always do, calls and vcs until maka sleep). Magagalit ako, mag aaway kami. He will insist na wala naman ako reason para magalit. Wala naman nakakagalit sa ginawa nya. And so on.

Context:
Then recently, nagcelebrate ng xmas party ang company nila. So go lang, kasi work related naman yun. I even asked him ano oras uwi nya, kaso di nya raw alam kasi walang nakalagay sa program. So okay lang. Matagal sya mag reply nun, kasi mahina daw signal dun sa venue. Ayoko naman maging makulit kasi may party sila so I let him lang at sabi ko enjoy.

Then around 9pm nagchat sya na may after party sila sa parang bar or lounge ganun with his work friends. Nag ask ako if wala sila pasok kinabukasan. And I said na ""ikaw kung gusto mo"", simply because I feel like I can't say No. Kasi he is in the middle of that, and me saying no will kill the fun. Hindi na sya nagreply nun. Sabi ko lang matutulog na ako at lowbat na din ako. Almost 2AM nagising ako, may chat na sya na galit daw ba ako, at andun na sila at nagsend ng video to show sino mga kasam nya. I feel like asking me if I'm mad is so unnecessary. I feel like it doesn't matter naman kung galit ako o hindi. It wouldn't change a thing naman.

From waking up 2AM, nag message ako na ano na hindi pa ba kako sya nakauwi. Until almost 4AM gising lang ako. Hindi ako makatulog. Until mag message sya na pauwi na sya. I immediately replied ""ingat"" at bakit 11:42 na ang huli nyang chat hindi naman pala kako sya lowbat, then he acts like everything is fine. Explaining this and that. Na nagkasiyahan, nasa bag ang phone, and etc. tapos hindi lang pala mga work friends nya ang kasama since yung ibang workmates nila ay sumunod din sakanila. So, idk the other people na kasama nila. Wala naman daw syang ginawang kalokohan. From that time nag update na sya na nasa bahay na sya, nag ayos lang bihis, at matutulog na daw sya.

I spend more time awake pa nun. Siguro 5AM na ako nakatulog. I feel so upset. Ni hindi nya manlang tinanong bakit gising pa ako. Or nagising ba ako? Or hindi pa ba ako natutulog? He acts as if everything is okay (ofc for him) Kinabukasan, message lang sya as if everything is okay. 

I feel so upset. Naiiyak ako sa sama ng loob. Pero thinking about it I feel like it's a waste of energy to open up about it to him. Sasabihin nya lang sakin wala naman syang ginawang masama at humingi naman sya ng pasensya sa no updates nya. Orrrr, he's just living his life outside our LDR, which I truly understand. I just hate why I feel like this. I understand naman mga teata/to na hindi lang saakin umiikot ang mundo nya at may iba pa syang buhay. Kaya ko sya pinapayagan kasi naiintindihan ko naman but I cant help it to feel this way. Ano po ba dapat kong gawin?

Attempt:
Minsan naiisip ko, I wish I could do those things din. But iba kasi yung nature ng work/profession ko. It requires full commitment. Work bahay lang literal. Even weekends ko minsan nacoconsume din. I have friends naman. But busy din sila sa life nila. And usually, lalabas lang for a coffee tapos catch up. That's it. Walang aabutin ng madaling araw. Haha",3,1733547829.0,adviceph,5,1.0,False

1h8l5ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aberdeen/comments/1h8l5ak/advice_on_comfortable_annual_salary_in_aberdeen/,Advice on Comfortable Annual Salary in Aberdeen,"Hello everyone,

I’m considering a job offer in Aberdeen and would greatly appreciate advice on what a reasonable or comfortable salary might be for living there.

The offer is £7,000 per month before tax. Based on my calculations, my take-home pay after tax and national insurance deductions would be around £4,900 per month. However, this seems like a significant deduction, and I’m unsure if my calculations are accurate*. (*[*source*](https://www.scottishbs.co.uk/intermediary-hub/intermediary-support/income-tax-calculator)*)* 

According to research from sites like [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city-estimator/in/Aberdeen?Recalculated=Submit+to+Recalculate&displayCurrency=GBP&members=3&restaurants_percentage=20.0&inexpensive_restaurants_percentage=70.0&drinking_coffee_outside=30.0&going_out_monthly=2&smoking_packs_per_day=0.0&alcoholic_drinks=10.0&type_of_food=1&driving_car=50.0&taxi_consumption=2.0&paying_for_public_transport=Monthly%2C+1+Family+Members&sport_memberships=0.0&vacation=150.0&clothing_and_shoes=50.0&rent=29&kindergarten_count=0&private_schools_count=1), the average monthly cost of living in Aberdeen for my family (me, my wife, and our son) is approximately £5,300. This excludes additional expenses like loan repayments or investments.

Given these numbers, I’m trying to determine if this salary is sufficient to live comfortably in Aberdeen, considering rent, utilities, groceries, and other family-related costs. Savings are also a key factor for me, as I have recent investments to manage.

If anyone with experience living in Aberdeen could share their insights, it would be incredibly helpful. Does this salary seem adequate, or should I consider negotiating for more to cover the cost of living and save comfortably?

Thanks in advance for your advice and guidance!",0,1733547725.0,Aberdeen,11,0.5,False

There is a guy at work that I would like to ask out ( I know how it sounds but please read the rest ) but i am not sure if I missed my opportunity. He seems to be physically attracted to me for about 1 year. Even asked if I was single to some colleagues of mine. It even seemed like He would go out of his way just to see me.That was last year until August. 

I wanted to ask him to go grab a drink but we worked together so I just couldn’t do it ! Then He moved to another department  and building in September. And ultimately I didn’t see him anymore. He became extremely busy as well . In November, I saw him for the first time since August, at lunch. I didn’t talk to him, but a few hours later, He came to my floor and started talking to me and my colleague. He was mostly talking to her but his body was always facing me ( as usual ). Then he left. 

Then in December. My dog died. I texted him to tell him about it since he knew I had a dog . We chatted for a bit by text . And the day after, he saw me heading to the coffee shop , and stopped me  just to greet me and talk about my dog a little bit before heading to his office. He seemed genuinely concerned, but I’m not sure if this was all friendly. 

I’m saying this because our interactions decreased drastically since September with his new job. He always been friendly, but before he was sometimes nervous/ flushed a bit. Now he seems to be more relaxed, composed. 

Just wondering if it all faded ? And if i missed my opportunity?

I wanted to share my experience exploring Los Angeles and help others plan their trips to this amazing city. I've lived here for several years and have hosted countless friends and family members, so I've pretty much become an unofficial LA tour guide!

First off, you absolutely can't miss the iconic Hollywood Sign. While you can see it from many spots in the city, I recommend hiking up to the Griffith Observatory for the best views. Speaking of which, the Observatory itself is fascinating - especially at night when you can stargaze through their telescopes.

Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier are must-visit spots. The boardwalk atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from SoCal - street performers, muscle beach, quirky shops, and that classic Pacific Ocean backdrop. The Santa Monica Pier's Ferris wheel is particularly stunning at sunset.

For movie buffs, Universal Studios Hollywood is incredible. The Studio Tour takes you through actual working movie sets, and the rides are top-notch. If you're into theme parks, Disneyland is just a short drive away in Anaheim.

One thing most tourists miss is the amazing food scene in LA. Skip the tourist traps and head to Grand Central Market downtown. It's a food lover's paradise with everything from authentic Mexican to artisanal coffee. While downtown, check out The Broad museum (it's free!) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

I recently discovered this awesome site https://athometouch.com/losangeles that lets you book various LA activities and tours. They have some really unique experiences that even surprised me as a local!

The Getty Center is another gem - amazing architecture, beautiful gardens, and world-class art collections. Plus, the views of LA from up there are spectacular. And it's free (just pay for parking)!

For nature lovers, Runyon Canyon offers great hiking trails with city views. If you're into beaches, Manhattan Beach and Malibu are less touristy than Venice and offer a more laid-back vibe.

Speaking of local spots, Echo Park Lake is perfect for a peaceful afternoon. You can rent paddle boats, grab coffee at a nearby cafe, or just people-watch.

Don't forget about the incredible shopping - from the luxury stores on Rodeo Drive to the quirky boutiques in Silver Lake. The Grove is a beautiful outdoor shopping center that's also home to the Original Farmers Market.

If you're planning your trip and want to make the most of your time here, check out https://athometouch.com/losangeles. They've got some really cool local experiences that'll help you see LA like a native rather than a tourist.

Last tip: LA traffic is no joke, so plan your activities by area. Don't try to do Venice Beach and Universal Studios on the same day - you'll spend more time in your car than actually enjoying the sites!

Hope this helps you plan your LA adventure. Feel free to drop any questions in the comments!",1,1733547090.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

Ever wondered what really happens when green coffee beans turn into that aromatic bag of magic we call roasted coffee? Last weekend, I visited Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters’ Govandi Roastery, and it was a caffeine-fueled crash course in coffee roasting! From the intense heat of the roaster to the precise science behind the 5 stages of roasting, it was like watching alchemy in action—but with coffee beans.

We even got to see a live roasting session where every crack, aroma, and color change told its own story. The highlight? Finally understanding how subtle tweaks can completely transform the flavor of your brew.

💡 Fun Fact: The first crack isn’t just a sound; it’s the moment when beans go from green to golden perfection. Coffee nerds, you know the thrill!

If you’re into coffee or even just curious about what goes into your daily cup of joy, this is your sign to explore the process. Big shoutout to the passionate folks at Blue Tokai for making this an unforgettable experience!

👉 Why this matters: Your coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an art, a science, and an experience. So, next time you sip, take a moment to appreciate the journey your beans went through!",28,1733547069.0,IndiaCoffee,6,0.98,False

How do I cope with her always having them around?,"When my girlfriend and I met, she'd been in the city I live in for a friend's birthday party. The friend having the birthday is unrelated, but the two I have an issue with were traveling with her. My girlfriend, let's call her Colette, and her friends had stopped at my favorite cafe to have coffee before heading out to the party. One of her friends had gone back out to their car for something or other while the other had gone to the bathroom. I'd been stealing glances at Colette for a while because she was, and still is, 100% my type. Seeing my chance, I got up, ordered another cup of tea and while walking back to my table, I stopped in front of hers and said something along the lines of, ""Hei, you're really pretty, and I'd love to get your number and set up a date."" She accepted and we've been together for a little over two years now.

During this time, those two friends have been around a lot. They come over a few times a week, Colette goes out with them very often, and sometimes she asks me to tag along with the group, which I do because I know how much they mean to her. The problem is that I find them incredibly annoying. All they talk about is sex, all they joke about is sex, and they do so seemingly as loud as possible. Colette makes her fair share of inappropriate jokes, she's only human after all, but not nearly as often or intensely as her friends.

Yesterday morning, Colette was telling me a story about something one of them did during high school when she cut herself off to tell me about an event she wanted me to attend with the three of them. She said that at the end of the week, they're going to see a movie and then go out to dinner. Usually, I'd say yes because I want to be there for Colette when she wants me to be, but the last time I hung out with her two friends, was about two weeks ago when we went out for lunch. When Colette got up to use the bathroom, they started talking, to my face, about how I'm ""no fun"" and ""bring down the mood"".  That didn't bother me too much, but then they started talking about how I've ""ruined Colette"" because apparently she used to be a lot more wild, but had calmed down since meeting me. I didn't respond and they stopped once she came back.

I don't want to hang out with them again, but Colette's happiness is much more important to me. And if she wants me to be there with her, who am I to say no?",1,1733546037.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- half Pinoy x half white 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW pics on my profile!)
- big fan of live music, good coffee, book stores, and silly questions like this!

Over the years, I've heard some people, both in person and online, say that my tite looks a little unique haha, or even weird. On the other hand, though, some have also seemed not to really notice. 

So now, I'm curious to hear what other people think, to see how ""different"" it really is, if at all. I'm especially interested in honest opinions, since it can be hard to tell whether someone in person is being more kind because they know me, or if someone online is being more harsh because it's anonymous. I'm hoping for an honest take!

So if you're interested in sharing your honest opinion, feel free to message me! I would be happy to share a picture on here, as long as you're comfortable with that! ",0,1733545615.0,PHR4Rhookups,0,0.5,False

2015 - started using mouse and curly shampoo
2020 - dyed hair for the first time, no bleach, semi perm dye
2021 - dyed hair fading, hair still pretty normal, only washing 2x a week. started basic skincare routine. moisturizer, toner, ninacamide, vitamin
C serum.
january 2023 - hair started becoming oily faster, 3x a week washing needed. face needed more washing.
february 2023 - hair greasy by third day, very noticeable visually and physically. face was oily by eod.
march 2023 - hair needed washing every other day, face was very oily within 3-4 hours, scalp would get itchy. took vitamin C serum out of the mix.
april 2023 - cut my hair short. summer 2023 - tried different shampoos, all recommended on reddit or websites and ones I wanted to try. added ACV rinses every 2 weeks. clarifying shampoo 1-2 a month. nothing was working.
i only condition my ends. have tried warm water, lukewarm, cool, etc. air dried, blow dried, styled, natural. products, no products.

i only condition my ends. have tried warm water, lukewarm, cool, etc. air dried, blow dried, styled, natural. products, no products. satin pillowcase washed weekly. brushes clean. use a scalp scrub massage tool since 2023.
2024 - my scalp and face are more oily than ever. ive cut out shampoos, tried different ones, switching them out, keeping it the same. added a scalp scrub recently, doesn't help. exfoliating my face recently every other day or every two days has been helping my sebaceous filaments so that's nice. tzone becomes oily within 2-3 hours of washing face/ skin care.
it's bad to the point like this morning, on day 2, my hair was soft but oily, my face felt like i hadn't washed it in days. i have never had this issue until last year, nobody in my family struggles with this. i have somewhat fine hair, potentially low porosity? so lately i haven't been put light oil on the ends, no mouse, nothing to weigh it down and still.
I get that this can be normal but that doesn't mean I want to be dealing with this anymore, it's not even about looks, i feel greasy and gross lol. It's itchy and just not comfortable. I don't want to wash my hair everyday because it takes forever to dry, air or using a blow dryer.

I've taken up to a week without washing, and done every other day usually, I don't think I can train my hair out of this. I'm not pregnant, never have been. birth control only used for a year,
2020 - 2021. my diet is clean, l've always drink lots of water, we don't have hard water since 2022 (but even on vacay or away from home, using hard water doesn't change this oiliness btw), i drink 1-2 coffee a day, and don't drink pop, the occasional processed sugar treat, i eat my proteins, veggies, etc.

So, all in all to ask, for those who have been through a sudden change like this with skin/ scalp, is anything helping?

1h8kfej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1h8kfej/does_anyone_else_really_enjoy_living_in_manila/,Does anyone else really enjoy living in Manila?,"So I see a lot of rants about Manila all the time. But personally I like it a lot. I wanted to make the post to see if there’s other people liking living here.

I’m privileged that I control my time, so I can go out whenever I want to. It’s incredibly easy to avoid the traffic hours, so traffic is not an issue at all.

Public transport barely exists here, but who cares, just Grab everywhere. Stuff costs like 150-300php per trip. Me and my wife go together. In Europe, a bus ticket for two people would be 240php. So I would rather pay similar price for a taxi that picks me up and drops me off exactly where I need to be than do the bus.

Access to international and local events is amazing. In the last 2 years I went to multiple basketball World Cup games. 3 international high end musicals. E.g. Philippines was the first Asian country to have Hamilton. Multiple local musicals. International concerts. Food experiences with one day fine dining events from high ends chefs. 

Access to the airports and everything around. The airport is huge, if you live strategically where you have good access to it, let’s say up to 30minutes drive. Then various small trips are very very accessible. There’s plenty of cheap and quick trips within Philippines. E.g. I’ve been wanting to go to Sagada but every time I think about needing to take a 10hour bus, instead I just get tickets to Bohol or some other island. 30minutes to the airport. Be there 1 hour before flight. 1h 20minutes flight. And I’m there.  Pay like 2500php and you are in a beautiful island in 3hours. 
Besides local stuff, the nearby countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong are incredibly accessible, short flight and cheap tickets.

The food options. You can truly find anything you want. All from super budget to very high end. All kitchens. There’s specialized things for everything. Often a lot of stuff is also accessible by grab and have long working hours.

Hobbies. No matter what niche hobby you have, there will be a community for it. I literally just passed by a huge tournament of a trading card game. There’s a rock climbing place that is always active. Skate park. Collectibles. Etc. there’s access to absolutely anything and people are friendly and welcoming.

Condo living. It’s actually really nice. Beautiful view. Amenities. Security. And connected to the mall that has access for shopping, groceries, immigrations office and food. No matter the weather I can always go out and do groceries or grab coffee without ever needing to drive a car. 

Also side note, but the air quality is surprisingly good. Many other cities that are this big have really poor air quality, but NCR has very little industrialization/factories, so the only pollution is from the cars. Making the air significantly better than many cities in Europe that have big industrial neighborhoods or burning stuff for heating.

It’s great. Of course there’s negatives like all places have. But overall there’s so many positives that are hard to get elsewhere. ",27,1733545153.0,Philippines_Expats,46,0.82,False

1h8kcl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1h8kcl8/my_parents_were_never_there_for_me_emotionally/,My parents were never there for me emotionally and I feel like it affects my relationships as an adult,"For context, I'm asian-south american (F 23). My parents and I moved to xx country when I was 2 years old due to work. They are incredibly hardworking people and thanks to them, I was able to get a good education. I'm thankful for that.

However, when it comes to the emotional side, I've realized my parents were never there for me. We have sort of a complicated relationship. My parents don't really speak spanish (my first language) and I'm not super versed in korean. This has put a strain in our relationship, as we don't communicate the way normal families do. I feel like I don't know them much and they don't know me either. They're also not super affectionate people, which doesn't help with this deep feeling of alienation that I feel.

Most of the times we talk about grades. They always expected a lot from me, you know, in typical asian family style. I just hadn't realized until recently that it was pretty much all we talked about. I've never had a deep conversation with any of them. I've had friends tell me excitedly how they told their moms about their new crush or whatever and that concept felt so foreign to me.

They're hypercritical about everything and judgmental, they're always gossiping about everyone.

In typical asian family style, they're also not very knowledgeable in mental health. When I was 5, the school counselor urged my mom to take me to the psychologist due to severe anxiety which turned out to be selective mutism. My parents took me once and decided that I didn't need therapy. I spent 3 years not speaking to a single soul outside of my family circle, and I was left to deal with it alone. I eventually overcame it, but I was left with social anxiety and thinking about it now, I just feel like I lost parts of my childhood because of it, and it makes me sad to think it could've been more normal had I recieved therapy.

My relationship with them is so strained to the point where I never felt safe to talk to them about my issues or ask for help. When I was 7 they left me with a babysitter who was emotionally abusive, extremely religious, would constantly tell me that I'd go to hell for doing things that ordinary toddlers do (like listening to music, watching movies, eating too slowly, etc), etc. I was on edge everytime she was around, because I never knew whether she would be in a good or bad mood, and it stressed me out. I would constantly try to find ways to please her. She'd give me the silent treatment if I did anything that bothered her, and all I wanted was for her to like me. Eventhough I scared of her, I could never bring myself to tell my parents, so she lived with us for five years. And it's not like my parents would've been okay with this behaviour. They would've been mortified if they had known. It's just that I couldn't bring myself to tell them. I didn't want to be a burden. I didn't wanna cause any problems.

When I was bullied, the only response I got from my mother was ""oh"". I was balling my eyes out and that was the only response. We never talked about it again.

I don't like it when colleges offer to buy me coffee. I don't even like when my parents spend their money on my clothes. I always felt guilty for asking for a birthday present.

All of these experiences have made me self isolate. I can make friends, just not deep ones. I feel like I cannot truly connect with anyone.

I think about it a lot these days because I met a guy and he was the greenest green flag that I had ever met. I had never met someone so kind before. He's pretty much the opposite of me. He asked me on a date and eventhough I liked him back, I rejected him due to fear. We talked about it eventually and I was able to open up a bit about my mental health. He understood and I could tell he was putting extra effort to make sure I felt safe. He encouraged me to open up, he said he wanted to understand me. But my brain still makes me feel like I need to push him away. My anxiety is through the roof. I want him and at the same time, my brain tells me to run away. I feel like my childhood has made it impossible for me to enjoy a normal relationship. I just feel so undeserving. I wonder why he even liked me.",4,1733544886.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.84,False
