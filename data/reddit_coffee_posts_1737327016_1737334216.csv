1i5e0ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i5e0ic/need_recommendations_for_beginner_for_good/,Need recommendations for beginner for good espresso beans that aren't too expensive,"I was using a Moka Pot for years, and usually bought the Costco 2lbs bag of San Francisco Bay French Roast. Unfortunately they discontinued it and I switched to Major Dickasons also from Costco and also tried some of the Kirkland brands. They were all ok, did the job, nothing spectacular.

However, now I switched my setup to an actual espresso machine and grinder, and I'm realizing how awful those beans actually are.

I am looking for some recommendations for beans I can readily get in LA and that are not too expensive but delicious through an espresso machine.

Most beans that I find outside of Costco are around $15-20 per 12oz which is just too expensive for me when I compare it to the 2lbs Costco bags for $16.

For flavor notes, I don't like fruity coffees at all. Usually I go towards medium / dark roasts with chocolate or caramel notes that are full bodied.

Any recommendations for such beans?
If there's truly none below the $15ish per 12oz, please recommend some that are actually worth the money.

Thank you! :)",1,1737334122.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1i5dzyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1i5dzyq/my_review_of_virgin_voyages_scarlet_lady_eastern/,My review of Virgin Voyages Scarlet Lady Eastern Antilles 8-Day Cruise. And why it will be my last cruise with Virgin Voyages!!!,"# I just returned today from an eight-day Eastern Antilles cruise aboard Virgin Voyages' Scarlet Lady. While the experience had its highlights, numerous issues significantly marred the trip. Below is an in-depth review of various aspects of the cruise, ranging from dining to entertainment and service.

# Dining Experiences

**The Wake Restaurant:**

* Bread and creamed spinach were standout items, but steaks were inconsistent, varying between excellent and mediocre.
* Breakfast options were disappointing. Eggs lacked flavor, and the salt provided was coarse sea salt, unsuitable for seasoning eggs.
* Service was subpar, with attendants like Bel being inattentive, and often distracted by their phones.
* Seating by the windows was restricted despite the section being occupied by other guests during brunch.

**Pink Agave Restaurant:**

* The chorizo and potatoes dish, elotes corn, and hanger steak were enjoyable.
* The enchiladas polo were bland, even with added salt.
* Desserts, such as the chocolate tacos, were overly sweet, a recurring theme for desserts across the ship.

**Lady Lotus Brunch:**

* The jalapeño bread and rainbow churros were decent.
* Other dishes, such as the wonton soup (with thick, cold wontons) and dumplings (hard and unpalatable), were substandard.

**Extra Virgin Restaurant:**

* Joanna and Angel provided exceptional service, with Angel standing out as the best server of the week.
* However, the wait times to place orders were excessive due to system inefficiencies. This was their best restaurant onboard. 

**The Galley:**

* Juice and lemonade options were severely limited. There were only three juice stations onboard, and bars primarily served soda.
* Rice Krispie treats at The Social Club were stale throughout the week, and flies were visible in the display case.
* ""Let's Taco Bout It"" was inconsistent, with dishes ranging from excellent chicken enchiladas to poor-quality duck tacos and overly fatty meat gyros.

**Other Dining Options:**

* The Test Kitchen was disappointing, with unappealing dishes like beef tenderloin with chocolate and beet puree.
* Pizza Place offered subpar pizza with toppings and cheese pooling in the center.
* ""Lick Me Till I Scream"" served ice cream that tasted comparable to fast food soft serve. Nothing fancy or elevated in the least.
* The Burger Bar in The Galley stood out with consistently good burgers and fries.

# Service and Staff

* While some staff members, like Joanna and Angel, delivered excellent service, others, such as casino manager Olga Ivanova, were rude and dismissive. Olga’s poor attitude discouraged further casino visits. The casino itself was closed for the biggest part of every day. A worker mentioned that Olga didn't want to keep it open.  She was nasty.
* Many staff members appeared disengaged or untrained, with incidents like a Russian worker in The Galley reportedly being handsy with a guest. Despite this being his third reported incident, no visible action was taken. Which was very appalling. 

# Ship Amenities and Maintenance

* Showers in the cabins were a highlight, offering hotter water than other cruise lines.
* The cleanliness of the ship was lacking. Sheets were not changed throughout the eight-day trip, and the walking track had soot falling from the engines.
* Two of the three ice machines in The Galley were out of service, and staff responses to inquiries about repairs were rude.

# Entertainment and Activities

* Entertainment skewed heavily toward an older demographic, with minimal variety for younger guests. Despite being marketed as a younger cruise, the music and activities felt geared toward those aged 60 and above.
* The Duel Reality show was decent but felt more like a cheerleading competition than a professional production.
* The lining up process for shows was inconvenient, requiring guests to queue 30 minutes prior, unlike the seamless entry offered by other cruise lines. It mirrored the disembarkation in that it was just more long lines. 

# Communication Issues

* The ship’s text communication system was unreliable. For instance, a text advertising Beef Wellington at Diner & Dash turned out to be inaccurate, as it was Asian Night instead. Similarly, confusing texts about disembarking in San Juan led to unnecessary back-and-forth between decks due to ramp issues. If you are not ready for people to get off the boat then simply don't send a text saying you are. 

# Miscellaneous Concerns

* The casino’s limited hours were frustrating, and the lack of a blender in the Casino bar made it impossible to order drinks like margaritas. Additionally, complimentary perks like unlimited coffee were of little use to non-coffee drinkers. As Casino loyalty match customers, we were given free drinks in the casino bar but couldn't order what they wanted which were Daiquiris and Margaritas because they had no blender. The offer was only good for the Casino bar.
* The Wi-Fi restrictions, including the banning of adult content, felt overly repressive and inconsistent with the cruise’s advertised open and progressive atmosphere.

# Conclusion

While there were some positive aspects, such as the excellent service from select staff and the quality of burgers at The Galley, the overall experience was underwhelming. Significant improvements are needed in dining, service, entertainment, and communication to compete with established cruise lines like Royal Caribbean. Based on this experience, I am hesitant to sail with Virgin Voyages again. I will NOT be cruising with Virgin Voyages again. I do reviews for different companies normally for a fee but this review was at my expense having to live through it the past 8 days. ",1,1737334072.0,VirginVoyages,0,1.0,False

It works just fine. I did a quick test by simply pulling off the cap on the propane, screwing on the torch. Pressed the button a few times and it worked. Yay.

I took off the torch and just before I put the little cap on the propane can, I just did a quick smell and I could get a wiff of the gas/propane. Sorry for my bad terms here.

Is this normal? I can't imagine what else there is for me to do with this other than putting the cap on. I treat it like my little tiny propane cannisters that I use for camping to boil my coffee. But they don't have a smell.

I’m intellectual but also very in touch with my body; I’d love it if you’re also a mix of the mind and the sensory. 

Healthy lifestyle is important to me and I value taking care of how I look, both outside and on the inside, so no I will not order McDonald’s with you, lol! I’d prefer a morning walk with you by the beach with some coffee, a afternoon yoga class (or something; I’m always up for trying something new) together, and then getting dressed up for some Michelin star dining in the evening.

I read a lot and am not woke. Opinionated and well informed, but not obnoxious. 

No kids, single, never married! Would prefer someone who can say the same. I don’t want kids, don’t want to hang out with yours, and don’t want to deal with any ex wife drama. I know, maybe a tall order, but this is Reddit, where we can be brutally honest. :)

1i5dsw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1i5dsw3/dont_feel_bad_if_your_pourover_sucks/,Don’t Feel Bad If Your Pour-over Sucks,"Here’s a brew method, that 

Firstly, I know more than regular folks about coffee, and not as much as many here.

Built an air roaster, with temp controller 10 years ago.  Don’t use it anymore.

If you’ve ever had the perfect extraction.  Where is makes your cheeks tingle with joy.

To be let down, by a new roast,  or next day extraction thats just bitter - and not as enjoyable… we’ve all been there.

Early on you get super into it.  Looking at all the gadgets… finding the perfect grind size.

Even buying a ppm meter for your water.

But realistically my method has gone from amazing Japanese filters… a slow pour… timing everything.

To grinding courser than I think I should.  Using a stainless steel filter (mainly because I’m lazy to literally click a button online to order more paper).

Heating water to a hotter than I think I should level.

Pouring water on the grounds to wet them.  (No stirring - because it’s a hassle)

Setting a timer.  Walking away.  Coming back 5 minutes later realizing I forgot all about it.

Then proceeding to pour 600 grams of water onto the beans to make up for lost time.

And drinking the coffee anyway… because I don’t care that much and need caffeine.

All in all - I see too many people trying to be perfect, when you can screw a lot of things up and still enjoy your cup.

Here’s some rules I’ve developed over the years that may come in handy to the beginner or seasoned pro to rip apart or be reminded.

1 -  Beans & roast matter.  (This should good without saying)

But early on I’d try to extract great flavor from crappy beans.  Duh.🙄 

Experiment and find a roast style you prefer. Light, medium, full city whatever you like is what works for you.

2 -  Use a scale for both beans and water.  Having a ratio of water to beans gives you consistency, when in your morning pre-coffee stupor you pretty much make it idiot proof.

3 -  Grind size over grind consistency.  Pour over is less fickle than espresso.  Grind courser than you think you should.  (Burr grinder preferably, because it’s just hard to get consistent with a whip grinder). You don’t need to screen your grind, it really it over kill.

4 - Water temp.  Brew hotter than you think.  Again I’ve experimented some but brew hotter than you think maybe 95 C.  Courser grind hotter brew -  at least for me = more idiot proof.

5 -  Try bottled water.  This can make a difference.  If you have water with too many minerals or not enough it can affect the flavor.

That’s really it.

I listed them in what will typically make the biggest difference.

Coffee is magical and not getting it right allows you to chase the dragon of that elusive delicious perfect cup.

Either way don’t be hard on yourself.  And heck this works for me.  

If you have suggestions of what works or want to add comment below.

I figured I’d write a post from a distracted lazy person point of view😂

Here’s to hoping your next cup is delicious.",4,1737333479.0,pourover,2,0.83,False

There’s a girl I have very strong feelings for. I’m not sure if she’s into me too- some things makes me think she is into me, some things not so much. Unfortunately I read way too into things and I find it difficult to tell what’s what.

We were supposed to get coffee together today but last night she texted me asking to reschedule. I did text her back this morning saying it was no problem and asked when worked for her. No text back of tonight- she’s pretty inconsistent with how often she texts so I’m not too worried.

It’s a little frustrating because we both have very busy schedules and it took a while to find the time today and then she canceled it last minute. However, I have no hard feelings toward her, sometimes things happen, and if she does try to reschedule it then cool.

But there’s the thoughts in the back of my mind; what if she doesn’t mean to reschedule it? What if she’s leading me on? What if she never planned on really going out with me? What if all the things I took as flirting were just her being friendly/polite?

I just wish I knew the facts. I thought I had my answer by the fact she agreed to getting coffee and texted as if she were excited about it. But I just don’t know now, and not knowing makes me anxious.

I’m usually a pretty confident person, I promise. But I’ll be damned if all that doesn’t go out the window whenever I crush on someone. I wish it weren’t so but here we are.",2,1737333297.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I’d crank up the volume on his alarm to wake him up in a panic and swap out his sugar for salt in his morning coffee. Every time he tried to smile, I’d remind him of that embarrassing moment he thought everyone forgot.)

^(Happiness is like heroin deceptively sweet at first but ultimately corrosive. People chase it, inject it into their lives, desperate for that fleeting euphoria, only to find themselves broken, dependent, and further from peace than when they started. It’s a cruel dealer, dangling the high just out of reach, forcing a spiral of more, more, more, while stripping away every ounce of contentment that once existed. If happiness was a person, it wouldn’t be a friend—it would be the con artist you regret ever trusting.)

^(Now,i realised if you wanted that son of a bastard known as happiness like me 4 years ago watching uneducated frogs trying to take control of your life just before injecting heroin into your butt has been the best bet.)

^(Well, I’ve said all these things, but in the end im just a hater of my past and seeing people trying to do the same. It just make me mad about the world. Its like people made theses "" Get theses fast free happiness stuff now "" just to take control of people who believe in nothing because ""puppetry is power"" in our society.

1i5dmum,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i5dmum,So I cut my own hair: some pictures and a brief essay on using style to heal from queer trauma,"My mom had silver hair down to lower back or longer all throughout my childhood, and I thought it was the most beautiful, magical thing I had ever seen. I still remember getting my first gray hair at 11 and being so excited that I might be prematurely gray like her someday. There were so few things in those early years that gave me a sense of joy or ownership in my body, but my hair was one of them, and I was constantly impatient at its growth and graying.

But I was a queer child, and therefore a problem child. Worse, no one in my family would ever stop to explain that I didn't fit their expectations of a straight and gender conforming child, much less the connection between that and their constant efforts to police my looks and affectations. Whenever I stepped too far out of line, my pride in my hair was the first thing to go. From puberty on throughout me running from home at 17, they'd regularly shear it down explicitly as a punishment. For weeks after I would feel so much more alienated and numb at my appearance in mirrors, I'd avoid them altogether. Over time, this and other efforts ingrained in me a sense that what I want for my body and how I feel about my body don't matter, and wound I've been struggling with for the last 12 years I've been out.

That numb, terrorized kid is a now grown woman, and that grown woman has been trying her damnedest to grow out her wavy and only slightly silver hair. Only, no one ever taught this woman how to value or take care of her body the way they ought to have. What's more this grown woman works long shifts on structural iron under the harsh sun, which fries her pride and joy just as crisp as the uv radiation from her welder does when she's in the shade. By the start of this new year, I was already feeling a sense of dread over the prospect of cutting out the damage, to this day going for a haircut leaves me feeling emotionally fraught. At the same time, the frizz, knots, and sun bleached color left me feeling less than my beautiful self.

So, I made myself a deal. I would cut out the damage on the condition I promise to give myself all the care I ought to have received from the start, forgive myself for trying and failing to grow out my hair, and learn my hair's needs the way I always should've been encouraged to. I threw out my Grocery Outlet shampoo and conditioner. I studied up on my hair type and it's needs. I spent all the money I had set aside for coffees, chocolates, and other pick-me-ups on the best hair regimen I could afford, and I cut, then washed, conditioned, and styled my hair. 

The initial result is cute and versatile, perfect for a woman who lives her life along the entire continuum of masc to femme.

The long term results, I can barely fathom, because it feels as though I've broken a curse. This soft, smooth tresses that were nonetheless entangled in so many neglected hopes and so much anguish, are mine again for the first time in decades. Given that my hair is one of many traumas I've endured, it gives me hope. If taking the time heal and nourish this neglected part of myself has already given me this much peace and joy, I can only wonder at what the same could do for the rest of my queer trauma.",6,1737332972.0,lesbianfashionadvice,0,1.0,False

1i5dkaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1i5dkaj/how_to_say_im_sorry/,How to say I'm Sorry,"I recently and finally feeling very happy and at peace with how my life is going. The last 8 years have been a whirlwind, I don't want to get into the details, but I had one friend who was particularly supportive for at least a year or two, she invited me for coffee every week and it was the only safe place I had to cry and just feel my feelings. I value our friendship so much. I don't know what happened exactly but I think I just got so wrapped up in the chaos of my life, that I didn't reach out to her. I was in survival mode for a very long time and did not have the emotional band width to be a supportive friend back. I feel like I can be that friend now, and she's accepted that I've reached out for a phone call. I want to apologize to her, and I accept that she may not want to be friends with me ever again. I just want to thank her for being such a good friend and apologize for never being there for her like she was for me. How do you think you would feel if your friend reached out to you like that? I'm just now coming to terms with how much I must have disappointed so many people during this time. But I always wrote it off as, well that wasn't me, I was in an exceptional situation, that was me in survival mode, it doesn't count. But it does count. My non actions and actions do affect people, regardless of it not being intentional.
I wish I could change that time in my life and be the friend I know she needed, too.

* Homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being childfree (non-negotiable)

* You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon—I prefer my adventures in or near civilization with AC, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea

As a child I was sometimes sent with him because apparently, he was a preaching expert, but all that meant was him being pushy and creating awkward situations that often involved me. He would make me memorize a script, naturally Id fumble and in the middle of it he'd step in, make a comment about me learning, take over and afterwards he would be upset at me for not ""trying"". One time when I was older, we stopped for break, and he saw a classmate of mine working at the coffee shop. I just said hi to him, but this guy had to call him over and create an awkward situation asking if I preach to him and some other probing questions(at this point I just sat down and tuned him out). He didn't like how I didnt stick around for his makeshift grill session. He also liked to test the humility of people by making them do ridiculous things. One time when we were having a cong. picnic in the park and even though he was standing right next to the garbage can, he called my brother over and made him throw out his cup. Perhaps the most ridiculous example of this was when he interrupted us working on the KH in order to teach my dad(who is an engineer) how to use a ruler for no apparent reason. He just walked over and made us stop for an impromptu demonstration. Even though he took the religion seriously, he treated the meetings like a funhouse. During one meeting he was especially misbehaved when he wouldnt stop tapping my shoulder(i was sitting in front of him) and he tried to trip the guy carrying the mic. Despite all this people would make excuses for him and say that he's an exemplary brother that says it as he sees it. ",13,1737332140.0,exjw,5,1.0,False

- sweetener (i put half a tsp of sugar free coffee syrop)

Whisk everything together and let sit for 15min. Psylliym husk will form a gel and then you spread it on the crepe pan and fry for a couple of minutes on each side. I usually get 5-6 crepes from this quantity.

He asked for my card and reached out for coffee after some texting back and forth for a few days. I knew that he was acting interested, but I thought there was no way he could actually be serious about me. I’ve always thought of myself as rather average. I work hard, but still struggle. 
We had a lovely coffee date and he very politely asked to kiss me at the end. He made it known that he was married but he is aware his wife is cheating on him. I was concerned about just being a “revenge partner” and maybe that’s what it was initially, but it has evolved far beyond that. I’ve never known such a thoughtful and considerate man. He is very kind, very communicative, and treats me like a queen. 
He will surprise me at my job, bring me gifts for no reason, drop off dinner or coffee for me. We talk everyday. Sex is exciting and passionate. He was the first to say “I love you.” Always offering to help me with projects or if anything breaks or goes wrong, he is right there to help. I have honestly never been treated so well. He usually sees me at least twice a week and I love that I never have to initiate plans. It is never just sex, but quality dates and time together, as well. He is on top of everything and makes me feel like a priority. He is very thorough and takes care of every detail for us. I never lift a finger or spend a penny. 
I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I’m trying to just enjoy the journey right now. I read a quote (I think it might have been on this sub!) that was something like “Happiness isn’t about getting everything you want, it’s about appreciating what you have.” I’m trying to keep that in mind as I wonder why he stays. I know marriages are complex, and there are many reasons why he may still be invested in that.

After playing with SignalRGB, I am surprised that the leds on my fans (16 leds fans x3) are mirrored with some leds on the strip (16 first at the beginning of the strip) and the leds on the case are inaccessible but have the same rendering as others. I'd like to point out that all the fans are on their own and chained to the second D\_Led connector on my motherboard.

My configuration: Gigabyte B450 gaming motherboard with 2 D\_Led connectors (apparently mirrored)

3x 120mm fans (16 Leds each), 2 chained strips, 1 case (noname xxLeds, I have to investigate this point: '( )

My goal is to be able to apply a SignalRGB layout (to see if it's possible and invest in lighting for my new graphics card :D).

After some misunderstanding and research, if I understand correctly, I'll need to add  a ""Controller ARGB"" to be able to configure each items separatly.

All I found are hubs (at 20€) that appear to be same things that a ""Daisy Chained"" pattern to synchronize Fans colors with PWM connectors... 

Are there controllers/splitters that allow me to address all my items separately ? 

On Amazon and some others i found some things but site's descriptions are confusing, with the term “Hub” appearing further down in the details, or devices with remote controls that make coffee ... my searches often brought me back to this thread, which is full of resources, thank you for your help.

I was a TA last semester and got along well with a student of mine who was around the same age as me (22). To get it out of the way, yes, I’m attracted to her and I’m almost positive she’s into me as she would stay after class to talk to me, sent me a kind thank-you email after the semester, and would blush whenever I called on her in class. My talks with her while she was my student were entirely professional and academic and I did not grade her any differently. Now, that she’s no longer my student and she never will be again because she’s graduating this coming semester, I was thinking of asking her to get coffee once school starts back up. I checked my school’s handbook and relationships with students are ok as long as they are not your current student, which she is not any longer. I’m also not worried about it affecting my academic relationships with other grad students and professors because we really don’t talk about our personal lives together and there’s really no way they’d find out. Would it be appropriate to ask her to get coffee with me? If so, what’s the correct way to go about it? If not, explain to me why it’s not appropriate to do so.

Update: So above is my post from a week ago, and I just decided to make a new post since it’s been a while. I followed her on Instagram yesterday AND… she never followed me back. Part of me is coping since she has a pretty large public profile that she just hasn’t seen it. I’m tempted to send her a DM or something like people suggested in the original post to boost my chances that she actually noticed I followed her and am interested in her but I don’t think I’ll push further.

last night i had a dream that i was with her at that party. we kissed and it was beautiful and romantic. i was thinking about tell her my feelings and got two of my friends opinions. both were on the opposite side of things from each other. i looked at her ig story and she posted this fortune cookie paper and it say “take the risk you’ve been considering”. how is that not a sign?

I have been having some weird symptoms. 

Shakiness at random times
Burning in my feet

I've been testing with a glucose meter (One Touch Verio) for the past week, and everything has been good (most readings under 90). 

Is this meter reliable? 

I had one of those shaky periods yesterday/midday and my meter read 113. I was shocked since this was the first time I've seen a number higher than 100. I may have been in ""post meal"" period since it was a little bit over an hour since I finished my 2nd cup of coffee (half and half with sugar free syrup).

I had a carby dinner (Cava bowl with no grains or bread) and Rebel ice cream last night, and my numbers have been higher today, but not crazy. My fasting blood sugar was 102 this morning when it's been in the 80s every morning since Monday. 

I saw my Dr on Thursday. He ordered blood work which I had drawn on Friday morning and I'm waiting! Not at all patiently. 😬

I've been taking a supplement with cinnamon and chromium before this all started. Has anyone had weird side effects from that? 

I've been doing keto/low carb for about a year with occasional ""anarchy"" (cheat) periods.  One of those periods was most of December, and I ate recklessly during that time. Holidays and a Disney trip!

I've been solidly back on the wagon since the 30th. I'm worried that I might have broken my pancreas.

Thanks for reading, all!

1i5d23e,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1i5d23e/just_the_flu/,JUST THE FLU,"I put on my running shoes with springs, designed to cushion the impact on the ground. It was my nightly ritual, something I did every single day without fail: running to the neighboring town, keeping my body busy and my mind free of thoughts. It was almost five o’clock, and the sun still stubbornly lingered in the sky, painting everything with a pale golden light.

I opened the door and was greeted by a strange smell. A mix of dampness and decay floated in the air, coming from somewhere behind me. The rotting stench made me wrinkle my nose, but I ignored it. I needed to run. I started climbing the hill, the wind against my face. I passed the entrance to the interstate highway, maintaining a steady pace. I was running at about 4 km/h, a moderate speed to warm up. I crossed the rusty sign that read “No Passing” and smirked bitterly.“Who’s going to pass you now?” I murmured to myself, my voice lost in the emptiness of the road. I kept running along the highway, the sound of my shoes hitting the wet asphalt echoing in the silence. When I approached the old brothel, a shiver ran down my spine. The place had been creepy at its best, but now… The sign that once announced the brothel’s name—something vulgar and flashy—lay fallen beside the building, which now resembled a charred carcass. The letters were faded, the wood that had supported the structure blackened and twisted like burned bones, and the windows were nothing but dark, empty holes that seemed to watch me as I passed.

The brothel was near a lake that used to reflect the vibrant, colorful lights of the facade on festive nights. Now, the water was dark, with an oily sheen under the faint light remaining from the day. The shore was littered with debris—broken bottles, pieces of wood that seemed to be parts of the building, and something that looked like a piece of red fabric.

A horrible smell emanated from the area, thicker than the stench of death I had encountered earlier. It was like a mix of rot and burning, as if decay itself had permeated the air. I looked at the entrance and saw that the old double doors, which used to spin open to welcome customers, were fallen, lying wide open on the ground. Inside, everything was in ruins: overturned tables, broken chairs, and what appeared to be dark stains on the floor and walls. Climbing the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of an abandoned property. The silence there was oppressive, broken only by the distant sound of thunder. The old farmhouse loomed like a ghostly shadow in the landscape. The main house was partially collapsed, with loose planks creaking in the wind, and the windows, which had once reflected life within, were now empty, like soulless eye sockets.

As I got closer, the smell of death grew stronger. In the yard, a man lay near the porch, his face covered in dried blood, flies buzzing around him. His glazed-over eyes seemed fixed on a point in the horizon that no longer existed. The ground around him was marked by erratic footprints and dark stains, as if someone had fought to survive there. Some children’s toys were still scattered across the dead lawn, creating a disturbing contrast to the scene of destruction. The trees around swayed in the wind, their branches like thin arms pointing toward the now cloud-covered sky.

In the stable, a few dead animals lay sprawled. The cow, still with blood on its muzzle, seemed to have collapsed recently. The horses lay beside it, their swollen bodies exuding that now all-too-familiar stench of decay. However, amidst this scene of horror, one pig was still alive, wandering among the corpses with hesitant steps, as if searching for a reason to be there. A few chickens pecked at the ground indifferently, their feathers stained with mud and blood. I passed through the fallen fence. Over the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of a place that seemed to have been abandoned long ago. The farmhouse appeared in the distance, shrouded in an ominous gloom. The trees around it, twisted by the wind, cast unsettling shadows over the waterlogged ground. As I got closer, the smell of blood mixed with decay hit my nose like a punch, making the air almost unbreathable.

In the yard of the house, a man lay sprawled, his face marked with dark patches of dried blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at the sky, as if searching for an answer that never came. The wooden porch creaked in the wind, and the door hung from its last nails, swaying slowly like a clock marking the end of time.

I moved forward and passed a truck stuck in the mud. The engine was off, and the vehicle looked as though it had been swallowed by the earth. Inside the cab, a man was slumped over the steering wheel, motionless. The putrid stench emanating from it was suffocating, but I no longer afforded myself the luxury of being bothered. I ran further, my footsteps echoing on the straight road leading me to the next town.

As I passed by a motel, it stood empty. The neon sign, which had likely once flickered incessantly, was dark and covered in soot. On the ground, bodies were scattered: prostitutes lying awkwardly, as if felled by an invisible force. The abandoned cars around the area told another story—a desperate escape, cut short before reaching its destination. The vehicles now came from the opposite direction, as if everyone was fleeing the city I had just left behind. The stench of decay permeated the air, a smell I was beginning to accept as part of my new reality. The sky grew darker, illuminated only by distant lightning. The stars, now almost fully visible, shone over the dead city. There were no more electric lights, no signs of life. A flash of lightning revealed the body of a small child, no older than five, lying next to her mother. They were holding each other, as if trying to protect one another until the very last moment.

Just one month. A single month, and everything was gone. There weren’t many people left now—perhaps no one but me. I thought about it as memories flooded my mind. I remembered school, before everything shut down for good. I thought of my girlfriend, my friends. All dead. Their families, too. Why am I still alive? That question echoes in my head every day. Why me? Why didn’t I die along with them? Along with everyone else? The Red Plague took everything but left me here, alone, wandering through this open-air cemetery.

As I run down this deserted road, my mind keeps revisiting the past, as if to torture me. I remember what the world was like before it all collapsed. Streets full of people, smiles, laughter. I remember going to school, complaining about classes, but secretly enjoying the routine, my friends, the small things that made me feel alive. My girlfriend… I remember her. I remember what it felt like to hold her hand, hear her laugh, feel the warmth of her embrace. Now, all that’s left of her is a memory that cuts like a knife buried deep in my chest.

My friends… Matheus, the one I used to joke around with, watch people at the mall, crack dumb jokes. We laughed like the world could never end. My mother. She died in my arms on the 22nd. That day is etched into me like a scar that will never fade. I held her as she drowned in her own blood, swollen, her eyes red and blind, unable to see me one last time. She tried to say something, but the words got stuck. And then she was gone. I can’t shake the feeling of her body growing cold in my arms.

I remember how happy we were with so little. I remember afternoons at the mall, eating McDonald’s and people-watching, everyone busy with their normal lives. I remember the conversations, the jokes. The sound of children laughing, the music playing in the stores, the smell of coffee and burgers. Now, all of it feels like a distant dream, something that was never real.

I even miss the things I once found annoying. The lines, the traffic jams, the bills. I’d give anything to have a life where those were my biggest concerns again. Now, all I have is silence. A silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps and the wind carrying the stench of death. It’s as if the whole world is frozen, stuck in a single moment. One month. Just one month, and it was all over. The world, which took centuries to build, collapsed in weeks. And I was left here, to watch it all end.

Heavy clouds rolled above me, dense and full of rain, occasionally lit by lightning streaking across the horizon. The smell of wet earth began to mix with the stench of decomposition, creating a suffocating sensation. The wind howled around me, cold and damp, as if trying to push me away from this place.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, drawing closer, like the footsteps of an invisible giant. When the first drop fell on my face, it was almost a relief, a reminder that the world still had something alive, something not consumed by the plague. The rain came suddenly, strong and relentless, drenching everything within seconds. The lightning illuminated the field around me, revealing a landscape that seemed ripped straight from a nightmare. Bodies were scattered everywhere, lying in random positions, as if the world had frozen at the moment of its greatest tragedy. Some were still in abandoned cars, others sprawled on the ground where death had caught up to them. Water ran over the corpses, washing away dust and blood, but it couldn’t erase the smell. That smell… No matter how much time passed, I knew I’d never forget it.

I kept running, feeling the heavy rain pounding against my clothes and skin, while my thoughts drifted back to things that now seemed impossible. I’d give anything to be home, on a normal day, eating a poorly made burger from some random diner, accompanied by greasy fries. Ice cream… How I miss ice cream. That feeling of cold sweetness melting on your tongue, dripping slowly as you try to savor every second. I’d give anything for ice cream right now. Or even something simpler: a glass of clean, drinkable water straight from the tap. Water that didn’t taste like rust or death.

I wondered what it would be like to sit in my room, playing video games, with the soft glow of the screen lighting up the space. And the internet… I remember how annoyed I used to get when it went out for a few seconds. Now, I’d trade my life to hear that annoying sound of a notification ping on my phone, any sign that the world still existed outside my head.

Electricity was another thing I’d taken for granted. Just turning on a light when entering a room, opening the fridge to find fresh food, or turning on the TV to watch something stupid. All of that had seemed so small before, but now it was an unattainable luxury.

The rain kept falling, heavier and heavier, as I looked up at the sky. Lightning flashed again, and more bodies appeared on the horizon. Children, mothers, men—people who once had dreams and worries just like me. Now they were there, motionless, as if they’d become part of the landscape. Why am I still here?” I asked myself as the water streamed down my face, mixing with the tears I no longer tried to hold back. They called it INF-1, the Beijing Flu, but I like to call it the end of the world. I don’t know exactly how it started. In Germany, it felt like we were safe at first. “The virus is far away,” the newspapers said. “We’re taking all the necessary measures.” Frankfurt Airport. A couple coming from Asia—nothing the government couldn’t control. That’s what they said.

Within days, hospitals began to overflow. It was like an invisible storm sweeping through entire cities. Berlin fell first, like a tree rotted from the roots. Suddenly, the streets were empty, except for ambulance sirens and muffled screams from behind windows. No one wanted to leave their homes, but it didn’t matter. INF-1 didn’t need you to be close to others. It found you anyway.

Bavaria, where I am now, was no different. The flu came like a shadow, silent at first, then brutal. Stores emptied. Schools closed. Train stations became packed with people trying to escape—to where, no one knew. I saw entire families crammed into train cars, coughing, unaware they were carrying death with them.

The virus was relentless. Symptoms started like an ordinary cold: a mild fever, a cough you’d ignore any other time. But within hours, people began drowning in their own blood. I saw my mother die like that. In my arms. Her face swollen, her eyes red, blind, as if her own body had turned against her.

Doctors disappeared first. Some died trying to save others, others simply vanished—maybe fleeing. I don’t blame them. Who could stand against this?

Germany had disaster plans, of course. We always did. Protocols for everything, from terrorist attacks to pandemics. But INF-1 laughed in the face of all of them. There was no way to track something spreading so quickly. No way to stop something that killed before you even knew you were infected. I remember the last time I watched the news. The anchor was a shadow of her former self, coughing between sentences as she read the numbers. “Seventeen million dead in Europe. The government has declared a national state of emergency.” Then the broadcast cut off. It never came back.

Now, Germany is nothing but a corpse. An entire country turned into an open-air graveyard. The cities that once pulsed with life are deserted, filled only with abandoned cars and bodies slumped in the back seats. Houses that once felt like fortresses are now empty, except for signs of struggle—overturned furniture, bloodstains on the walls, locked doors that no one will ever open again.

The smell… That’s the worst. You never get used to it. Decomposition has taken over everything. The air is heavy, as if the very environment is dying alongside the people. I wonder if it’ll ever go away. Maybe not. Maybe that’s INF-1’s final legacy.

I think about who we were before all this. Wealthy people driving luxury cars, living in expensive apartments, making plans for the future. Now, we’re all the same. It doesn’t matter if you were a banker, a teacher, or someone like me. INF-1 didn’t discriminate. It just took. Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin. All wiped out. Just the flu. It didn’t need a war. It didn’t need bombs or tanks. All it took was a virus.

I wonder if anyone else survived somewhere. If there are others like me, trying to make sense of why we’re still here. I used to ask myself every day: why didn’t I die with the others? Why didn’t I catch the Red Flu? Why was I the only one who made it through? But you know what? Screw it. The answer doesn’t change anything. I walked to a dusty shelf in a local market and found a forgotten chocolate bar. It was slightly squished, the wrapper worn, but it was still chocolate. I picked it up, unwrapped it slowly, and took a bite, tasting the sweetness, though strange, as if my sense of taste wasn’t the same anymore. While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",1,1737331287.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1i5cyna,https://www.reddit.com/r/JelaniDay/comments/1i5cyna/timeline_leading_up_to_jelanis_disappearance_per/,Timeline leading up to Jelani's disappearance per police reports and interviews,"According to one of Jelani’s instructors **(NOT Cara Boester)**, he was struggling in the program and clearly distracted (understandable with his dad being sick). She stated he needed lots of support throughout her class to achieve an “A”. She mentioned he was not showing up to class, was not reading his emails, and needed frequent reminders to turn his work in on time. She and other instructors spoke/met often about their concerns with Jelani’s progress. It was apparent to her that Jelani was struggling in his other classes, also. However, the instructors felt it was important to have their students feel as though they were on track.

***August 23, 2021*** (Monday)

**11:00 AM** \- This instructor **(Course Instructor and Clinical Educator)** set up a meeting with Jelani. When she spoke with Jelani she asked him some hard questions. They discussed his failure to submit a plan, to review his notes, and about his lack of professionalism in general. She described that Jelani was angry or frustrated at the expectations and believed that Jelani was likely upset because he was caught not performing well.

**1:00 - 2:15 PM** \- According to one of Jelani’s cohorts, he showed up approximately 30 minutes late to this class and appeared ""frantic"" coming into the class very quickly, sitting down, quickly opened his laptop and began taking notes. Jelani was very quiet during the entire class, which she stated was out of the ordinary for him. Jelani was normally an active participant in class and spoke up a lot.

**2:15 - 2:30 PM** \- A classmate saw Jelani walking near Dale Street and Main Street and described him as looking “dazed and confused”. She pulled up and asked him if something was wrong.  
He stated he misplaced his vehicle in one of the nearby parking lots. She gave him a ride back to Fairchild Hall. She stated his mind seemed like it was somewhere else and he was not very talkative.

**7:28 PM - 9:23 PM** \- Jelani called Cara (**Director of Clinical Education**). They spoke over the phone and texted in regards to him completing the 2 Step TB test so he could see his patient the next day at 3 PM. When he sent her his results, Cara noticed that he had only done the 1 Step TB test. The plan was for him to go to the Student Health Center the next morning to start the second step and show her. If he did that then he could see his patient on Tuesday. If he didn’t, then he would be non-compliant and would be unable to see his patient. (**Text messages from the Cellebrite extraction report prove their conversation was school related**)

**9:41 PM** \- Briefly spoke with his brother which was the last call on Jelani’s phone

.

***August 24, 2021*** (Tuesday)

**7:08 AM** \- Surveillance footage shows Jelani entering the Bone Pay Lot at ISU.

**7:19 - 7:21 AM** \- Arrives at Starbucks on campus and waits for his coffee.

**7:39 AM** \- Exits Bone Pay Lot. According to the footage, he was only on campus for 31 minutes. The health clinic does not open until 8 AM and no one remembers speaking with him.Missed meeting with Cara, didn’t show up to his clinical or see his patient at 3 PM. Did not call in or text that he would be absent.

***August 25, 2021*** (Wednesday)

**12:00 PM** \- Jelani misses a clinic meeting

**1:00 PM** \- Jelani doesn’t show up for class. Cara Boester (**Director of Clinical Education**), Heidi Verticchio (**Clinical Director**), and Heidi Harbors (**Faculty)** go to Jean Sawyer (**Department Chair**) with their concerns about Jelani missing classes, being late to meetings, being out of compliance with clinicals, and he quit responding to calls and texts. Jean Sawyer (**Department Chair**) then submits a report online to the **Redbird CARE Team.** ISU staff member, Joseph Thomas (**Dean of Student/Case Manager**), checks with dining services and the rec center and finds there had been no activity from Jelani. He also leaves a voice message on Jelani’s phone.

**5:00 PM** \- Jean Sawyer (**Department Chair**) submitted another **CARE** report reiterating that they were very worried about their student and would appreciate an update. The ISUPD requested BPD to attempt to locate Jelani.

**Evening -** Jelani's brother, D’Andre, called Carmen to let her know the police were at the house in Danville looking for Jelani. No one could reach him so D’Andre drove to Bloomington. In the meantime, Carmen speaks with Cara and a classmate of Jelani’s.

**8:57 PM -** BPD was unable to locate Jelani at his apartment. His car was not there and attempts to contact him via phone were unsuccessful. D’Andre met with an officer at Jelani’s apartment and stated he wanted to list Jelani as a missing person.

**11:00 PM** \- Jelani is entered into LEADS as a missing person.

***August 26, 2021*** (Thursday)

**9:32 AM -** Jelani’s dad waved down ISU Officer, David Erickson, in the Bone Pay Lot to advise him that there was a transaction on Jelani’s credit card at the Bone Student Center Starbucks on 8/24/21. The officer reviewed the video and a copy was logged, labeled, and uploaded to the ISUPD Q-Drive server.

Carmen spoke with Cara in her office that morning.  After leaving, she later called Cara to ask for her help in retrieving campus footage.  When Cara called her back, she told Carmen that footage had already been retrieved by the police.  Cara told Carmen she knows someone in the police department that had some higher up authority and they would get a detective on the case.

**10:32 AM -** Sergeant Paul Jones met with Jelani’s dad and older brother at Jelani’s apartment.

**12:08 PM** \- Paul Jones speaks with Cara Boester

.**4:20 PM** \- Jelani’s car discovered behind the YMCA

I just got prescribed 30mg vyvanse (generic) and wanted to experiment on the best time to take it. What I struggle with the most unmedicated (amongst the multitude of my ADD/ADHD symptoms) is binge eating and the physical/mental crash I get between 1-4pm (which usually involves a nap). I drink coffee once or twice daily, get plenty of sleep, weight lift + train for my 2nd marathon, and work at Crumbl haha. BUT I should be starting medical school come August if my interviews go well so that's why I wanted to hone in on my routine and seek help regarding my mental health :)

ANYWAY, I'm an early bird and love life between the hours of 6am-12pm because I usually am so productive and brain function is at 100%, but once the afternoon comes, I'm depressed, prone to binge eating, unmotivated and really feel like I have no more time left in the day. This cannot fly once I'm back in school because I will need all the time in the day to study/workout/clean.

I have been drinking my coffee in the morning and then taking my Vyvanse between 2-3pm and I have been easily been able to fall asleep at 10pm (my normal bed time). Is this normal or recommended? 

I know it's meant to be taken in the morning, my provider told me no later than 9am, and I see a lot of people on here take it early as well. I just know the inevitable crash that happens on stimulants after 4-6 hours and can't afford to feel even worse during that time of day. I did take it once at 10:45am and by 4pm I was yawning and done for the day. 

It seems to have the best effect 1.5-4 hours after ingesting. 

I also plan on only taking it on days when I really need it for tolerance purposes. But since my follow-up is in a month and my first time on a stimulant, I've been taking it daily to find what works for me.  

What are your thoughts?

TLDR: I take my 30mg vyvanse between 2-3pm to get me through the rest of the day and to avoid the midday crash. The effects last 2-4 hours for me and I go to sleep just fine. ",1,1737330865.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

Cigarette smoker
No alcohol, caffeine, or other drugs or medication

For the past 2 weeks I've had strange headaches at the back of my head, close to the top of my neck, particularly after 3pm. I'll be fine until I have to sit and then stand, or bend over and then stand. Then I feel intense pressure and pain in my head. Laying down makes the headache slowly go away. It seems to get worse and start happening earlier each day. Originally it was only happening after about 9pm.

I cut out all caffeine (not that I drank much to begin with, typically 1 cup of coffee in the morning) and all alcohol to see if it would help, which it didn't. My work schedule varies so I don't think it's a stress thing related to getting home from work. I've been careful about not skipping meals and I drink a good amount of water. I used to have migraines but those had warning signs, like flashing lights, and I haven't had one in close to 20 years.

Mostly I want to know if I should go to Urgent Care or wait it out, or if anyone knows a way to fix it on my own. I unfortunately don't have a primary care doctor. Thanks in advance!

1i5cw7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1i5cw7m/the_things_we_want_for_things_a_short_story_i/,The Things we Want for Things - A short story I wrote a few months ago,"**The Things we Want for Things**

The man looked down at the ground and saw a painted iron pipe protruding through the decaying foliage.  “That must be marking the northern corner, so I figure this is where our property line would be.”

“It’s an awful nice place,” she said surveying the canopy of the trees.

He lit a cigarette and kicked away the leaves to expose a section of sandy soil and cracked acorns while he thought to himself.  Looking back at her, he noticed how beautiful she looked in the strands of light coming through the treetops.  He appreciated her patience with him. 

The man did some quick math in his head and determined they could afford it, so long as he could put up with his old truck for a few more years.  They would have to hold off a little longer on the addition to their trailer as well. 



 “The owner bought the parcel when he came back from the Vietnam War, I guess he wanted to build a retreat for himself.  Hippie type – you know the kind.”  The realtor paused and looked for acknowledgement from the young couple. They smiled and nodded to oblige him.  “Anyway, that was some ten years ago now and he figures he won’t get around to it anytime soon so he’s just gonna sell it.” 

On the drive home, the man turned down the radio, “you don’t think it’s too far, do you?  We’d be able to get up there pretty easy on the weekends.”

“No, I don’t, I think your just being nervous.”

“Ok, Good.  I don’t either.”

Excited again, he talked to her about some ideas he had for how to construct the cabin and she thought about the sounds resonating from the creek bottom and how the leaves would turn to a rust color next month. 



That night when they made love everything was different for him.  The way he held her was different.  The way he stroked her hair was different.  The way he kissed her was different.  He felt like this time, for the first time, there was a purpose to what they were doing beyond the normal impulses.  When it was over, his eyes were flickering, and he began to cry motionlessly. She asked him what was wrong, and he explained that he was just overwhelmed and that he loved her.  He said he had all these dreams for their lives, and he would stop at nothing to make them happen.  She had never heard him talk like this before and she didn’t know what to say, so she pulled his head toward her shoulder and comforted him.

Two weeks later they started trying. 



He spent most of his waking hours and indeed many of those in which he dreamed thinking about ways to get back to the property and start working.  His shifts at the packing plant, which previously had dragged on and felt like an eternity, were now going much faster as the monotony was filled with planning and thinking through various scenarios.  He thought about when they had kids, and how they would go up as a family.  He thought about his wife smiling and looking up at the trees. 

He took overtime at every opportunity during the week to save up some extra money but kept the weekends open so that he could work on the foundation, frame the walls, and put the trusses up. 

It didn’t take the man long to get the cabin roughed in and sealed up.  “We can always add on, maybe build a second bedroom, but for now I think this’ll work.”  She agreed and told him that she wanted the porch done first. 

It was late October now and she was looking at the auburn leaves.  He read a well-worn book by Aldo Leopold and listened to the red oak acorns striking the steel roof.  They conversed only in fragments and mostly enjoyed their shared solitude.  That night, they sat under the sky, in a void of light and sound, with nothing to distract them except the low fire sending sparks toward the cosmos.  As the hemlock knots popped in the blaze, they talked about the future.  He placed a fresh log on the fire and adjusted to lay on his back.  Though he could only see a few of the distant stars shining through the branches, he enjoyed looking up.  It was easier for him to talk honestly without making eye contact.  The woman laid a hand across her stomach.  “Do you think it’s a boy or a girl?” she asked and looked over at the glowing silhouette of his profile. 

“I don’t know,” he paused, still looking up, “a girl I guess.”  And he hoped it was a girl, but he didn’t tell her that.



They had a son and a daughter and after the second child was born, she had to stop working to take care of them.  One evening, when he was loading his truck to go up to the cabin, she came out of the trailer. “You’re not going up there tonight, I need your help here.”

“We have been over this.  We talked about it last week.  Its opening day of rifle season, I’ll be home Sunday afternoon.” He looked at her and tried to read her facial expressions in the dark.  He could sense it was not an answer she would accept so he added to the negotiation, “I’ll watch the kids next weekend and you can relax, go visit your mom or something.” 

“That’s not the point.  You do this all the time.  I need you to be here.”

“I’m here a lot.”

“Well, I’m always here.”

He couldn’t think of anything to say so he took the keys out of the ignition.

“Alright, fine. Go.” she said flicking her cigarette butt at the grill of his truck then turned and walked back inside. 

The door closed with authority.  He stood there for a moment then climbed back into his truck and put the keys back in the ignition. 



“I was thinking, it’s getting pretty tight in here what with the kids getting so big, do you think this summer we can we do that addition to the trailer?” She asked without looking away from the laundry she was folding.

He sipped his beer and tried to suppress the annoyance he felt.  “You know that we don’t have the money for that.  Our savings, what savings we had, we spent on the transmission and that new coat you needed.”

She stopped folding, “don’t pull that shit, the coat cost 25 dollars.” 

He knew she was right, so he changed the subject. “The Packers might actually have a shot this year,” he said motioning with his beer bottle to the tube TV.

She didn’t say anything.

A few moments later she reopened the subject, “We could look into selling the cabin.”

“Out of the question.  Besides the kids love it up there.”  He wasn’t exactly hurt, but something close to it.  He knew she had thought about the idea of selling, but this was the first time she had said it out loud.  He had thought about it too but in an abstract way, not as an option to be explored yet.   

“They go up five times a year.  I’m just trying to be realistic.  I heard on 60-Minutes that land has been going up in value.  It could really be worth something now.”

“It’s worth something.” 



His coffee had gone cold, and he looked around the small office.  He scanned the maple bookshelf which displayed plaques to commemorate achievement, pictures of a family at the beach, and a few carved pine mallard decoys that had never seen a creek or pond.  The man was forty-seven and he felt his age today. 

“If you aren’t willing to sell the cabin, you’re going to have to give up almost all of your other assets in the settlement.” His lawyer was explaining. “We can sell the singlewide that is in both your names and probably get her to split that, but your retirement funds with the union will have to go to her, as well as most of the joint savings you have set aside.”

He took a sip of the coffee, “that’s fine.”   



There was a patch of hemlocks in a hollow on the back half of the property where the man liked to pass the time.  He left a lawn chair leaning against one of the trees and sometimes he would take a six pack of beer or a book and sit enclosed in their needles for a few hours, then return to the cabin.  He liked the hemlocks because they didn’t know what year it was.  The oaks and maples knew the change of the season, but time stood still in the hemlocks.  Things were always how they always were there.  Always how he left them.



His son now had a daughter of his own.  The man didn’t see him often anymore, but he would call him periodically.

“You all still good to come up here for Thanksgiving?”  He asked his son.

“Yes, we are looking forward to it.  We’ll bring a sweet potato casserole.”

“That’ll be good.  I was thinking, last week I saw an eight point down by the creek bottom.  He got a busted brow tine but he’s still a dandy.  Let’s go up to the cabin after Thanksgiving and see if he doesn’t walk under that old ladder stand we built back in ’98. I added a few more 2 by 6’s to it last week and its real sturdy now.” 

“Jill has gymnastics this week, Dad, we’ll have to be heading back down to Illinois after dinner.” There was a silence on the other end, so he added, “I bet he’ll be a ten-point next year, let’s make a plan to get him then.  We can put some corn out next summer. Alright?

“Ok.”

“Ok?”

“Sure.” The man looked out the back window of his duplex apartment.  The neighbors were playing in the shared yard with their kids. “How’s your mother doing?”

“Good, she’s doing well.”

“Good.”



One afternoon some years later, he leaned an aluminum ladder up against the rain spouting and scaled to just below the soffit of the cabin.  It was clogged with leaves and the water had been running over the sides.  There was an algae like film building up on the siding from the moisture and the pollen.  He took two handfuls of leaves out and felt his balance fail.  The ladder slid toward the chimney, and he reached for the stove pipe.  At the last moment he was able to steady the ladder.  He waited for his heart rate to slow and then climbed down the ladder. 

He was no longer a young man, nor could he even call himself middle aged, and it was hard for him to accept that.  The neglected cabin was becoming a sad site to see, and it seemed to hit him all at once.  He called his ex-wife that evening.

“Do you remember the first night after we bought our property?”

“Have you been drinking?”

“No. Not much.”

“Yes, I remember it, why?”

He knew all the things he wanted to say.  All the memories he had and how badly he wanted to go back to that time.  The things he wanted to apologize for, how he wished it had gone differently.  How many things he wished he had *done* differently.

“I guess I just wanted to see how you’ve been.”



A young man pulled off the side of the chipped stone road.  He looked over at his girlfriend, nodded, then put their SUV in park and got out.  As they walked over to the cabin, they saw an old man sitting on the porch which looked to have been recently constructed compared to the rest of the cabin. 

“We called earlier about the ad on Craigslist, are we at the right place?”

“Yes,” said the old man. “Take a look.  Let me know what questions you have.”

They looked around the structure and the young man quietly talked to his girlfriend about what it would take to fix the place up.  He seemed optimistic and excited.  She did too.  The old man appreciated seeing someone take interest in the cabin, but he gave them space and tried to look like he wasn’t eavesdropping.  The young couple disappeared into the woods to see the rest of the property and reemerged twenty minutes later.

“We like it a lot.  What do you want for the place?”

The old man smiled dryly and looked at his shoes.  He knew what they were asking, but all he could think about was all the things he had wanted for the place.",2,1737330821.0,KeepWriting,1,1.0,False

I feel horrible, but still standing my grounds. 

To give a bit of context. I’ve been with him for just over a year now, and the connection that we share is something I have never experienced before. I can feel the flame burning in me, and it’s just electric being with him. Often times when I rub his back in the evening there’s an actual spark to the touch, it feels magical. 

Our relationship has been intense since day one. After one week of knowing each other we went fully exclusive, a month after went to holidays and 4 months knowing each other we moved together. But wait, story is only getting better! 6 months after knowing each other we decided to open a coffee shop together. Sounds like a dream? Well you thought so. 

On one side, the love that I am feeling to him is out of this world, and we compliment each other in so many ways. Share the same vision, way of life and we match in so many many different areas. 

But having a business together? Is like all hell broke loose. Jesus Christ, I have  never had anyone testing my nerve like him. And on the top of that business is not doing amazing, it’s doing okay. But it’s just too much work required and not much reward back. 

To give you a little bit more perspective, we have staff and we also help each other with half days. Today, I was supposed to finish at 11am, but because it was quite & he had been working a lot I’ve said to him to come at 1pm that he can get more rest. But did he turn up at 1pm? No, of course he didn’t. He came half an hour, and forgot half of the things that I have texted him in a WRITTEN form for his convenience to read through, which he had to go back and get it and on top of that once he came back he was eating lunch. You are disrespecting my time by not just half an hour anymore but now an hour and a half! I was meant to get off an hour and a half ago, doing the behind admin work, but no I am still there. 

What was the cheery on the top of all this you may ask? Well he throw a tantrum. When he came back the place wasn’t too clean as I had customer, but at this point I have cleaned it twice when he didn’t show up. And then on top of that I was changing the waste water which he spilled everywhere and I refused to clean anymore. 

And then he left me there with customers and he went to finish his food. After I was done with customers, I said to him that I am going and I walk away. I went to another coffee shop to try focus on some work, and as soon as I sat down I received a message saying he’s left. Rest assured I check the cameras and he’s not there and the whole place is a mess. 

I go back, stay open until we closed, cleaned up well enough for the staff to be able to work tomorrow. I sent him a message if he doesn’t come back by 3.30pm I will be really really mad at him. Of course he didn’t come in, and at 3.35pm I text him I am staying with a friend tonight. 

Finished worked at 4.30pm, went home, showered & packed the bags. I was out by 6pm, got on the train into the city and whilst sitting on the train I found the hostel I am staying now. 

Fast forward to know and I feel horrible. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to turn for help. I am lost. I hate when we fight, I love him so much, but sometimes he is impossible to deal with - especially working together. This business has been way too much for us, our relationship is really suffering. I wish i’d be that easy just plugging the cord tomorrow and stopping with the business. 

Also I’d like to mention this is not the first time that he was late. He is always late when I am working in the morning and he closes. I don’t think there was a single time that he was on time. We had fights about this before and it seems like he just doesn’t learn. This time around it was really a step too far, it was really disrespectful to my time and me. 

I don’t want to lose him, he is really my everything.

In college I had a close group of girl friends and one of the girls had mentioned our first year in university that she liked this guy. We all knew the guy because he worked at the coffee shop we all hung out at. She went on that year to have crushes on four or five different guys. Going into our second year, I had gotten more confident and was pretty outgoing. I got to know many of the people who worked at the coffee shop, including the previously mentioned guy. He ended up asking me to hang out and I said sure. I recalled my friend having mentioned she liked the guy but that was long ago and she had never hung out with him or even talked to him one on one personally. She only admired from afar like someone would with a celebrity crush. So I said yes and we hung out a couple times. Some of my friends knew we had been hanging out and had told the girl. I did not think it was a big deal because just a week prior the girl had mentioned having a crush on another guy. So I figured she had moved on and found someone new to crush on. We eventually decided to start dating. Around this time I felt my friend group start to shift. I thought everything was good but apparently the girl found out and was really mad. I later learned my friends were talking behind my back and were mad at me for even hanging out with the guy. One day I was home and I walked into the main room to find the girl there sitting on the couch. She turned to me and said angrily ""I broke and lamp when I found out you were dating him"". I had been having a lot of anxiety and I already do not like conflict. I was very freaked out and went to my room to think about how to approach the conversation. I was really confused because I thought she was crushing on some different guy and why was she sitting in our home and was she waiting for me. I tried to calm myself and collect my thoughts when she started banging on my door and demanding I open it. I started crying and went into a full blown panic attack and hid in my closet. Then more voices started yelling threatening to call the cops and banging on my bedroom window and door. I called my mom and she tried calming me down. My mom also spoke to one of my roommates and told her I was fine and just very anxious and freaked out and needed space. I eventually got calmed down enough to come out of my room and find eight girls in our main room looking at me. One is crying and tells me she thought I died. I am super confused as to why all my friends are here and try to explain that I had been having some anxiety issues recently but I am not sure why they would think I was dead especially since my mom talked to one of the roommates. They then began to lecture me and explain that I should have come out when they threatened to call the cops. They mentioned that they had all been talking about me behind my back about the guy which really upset me. No one came to me before this. They then went on to say that I should have told the girl that I was dating the guy. I explained that we had just decided to start dating and I thought she did not like him anymore. Also, that she never spoke to the guy or expressed her interest to him. The last time she mentioned liking him was a year prior. It felt like they were all ganging up on me and was very overwhelming. This experience ended up fracturing our friend group. I was so confused and upset and felt like an awful person. I was so confused why everyone was talking to each other but not me. It was like they said one thing to me in person but another behind my back from then on. Ever since this experience I have a really hard time trusting people and making friends. I think about this experience at least once a week and I genuinely think I am a bad person. Needless to say this same girl later began flirt with the boyfriend of one of the girls in the group openly and told the others she wanted to steal him from her. None of the girls are close to each other any more but I still think about these events and still feel awful. I apologized to the girl and told her I should have mentioned that we were seeing each other sooner. She would say she accepted the apology but would go and talk about me behind my back. So AITAH because ever since this experience I feel like I am an evil person who hurts people on purpose and I can't change how I see myself. For example, if I cry about something to my boyfriend I have a small voice in my head that says I am doing it for attention and I am not actually upset and should just stop. I did go see a therapist after this experience and it helped some but I just still have never been the same since. I also have talked to my boyfriend and mother about this and they say the girl was crazy given things she did in the two years after, but I am not sure if they are jsut saying that because it is me.

1i5cla7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PvZHeroes/comments/1i5cla7/unused_animations_in_pvz_heroes/,Unused animations in PvZ heroes,"So for context a lot of cards in heroes have unused ability animations that are only seen via overshoot or modding the game. So I decided to just think of a ways they could be used in a patch, what they were supposed to be used for, or other ways they were supposed to be used.

For the cards that have the ability to effect other cards when either played or as a passive ability (Smashing garg, Gadget scientist, Parasol zombie, Teacher, Gargologist, Forget me nuts, Umbrella leaf, Spyris, and Dark matter dragonfruit) they could just play when they are placed down and then the ability activates afterward.
Similar thing for Gadget scientist, Trickster, Plantern, and Pod fighter just doing the animation when their ability is triggered.

For the anti-hero plants that have an unused animation I have a theory for what they were supposed to be used for. My idea is that they were supposed to be used when doing the anti-hero attack to the zombie hero and dealing extra damage, but was probably removed since it did the animation when buffed by normal means.

For the fusion plants that have unused animation (Lily pad, Pumpkin, And Pea patch) I don’t understand why these were put in the game even though the fusion plants just turn green and just stay there when they have something played on it.

For the zombies that have unused death animations and also give you a card on death (Octo zombie, and Turkey rider) they could just play when you’re milled and can’t draw another card, but for Gas giant it could just play when destroyed and deals damage to the plant hero.

For the environments that have unused animations (Coffee grounds, Red plant-it, Laser base alpha, and Moon base) it could just do it when something is placed in it.

Now for a few miscellaneous ones

Space pirate could just do its unused animation when moving lanes, and do the monkey shooting a laser thing for its anti-hero attack.

Unthawed Viking could do its unused animation when freezing everything, and it’s normal when only freezing the water. 

As for everything else I have no idea, they either already have animations when doing what they do or have no abilities in general so I’m out of ideas. 
Feel free to suggest ideas since I’m fresh out of them.

**The Situation:** We’ve been married for five years and have two young children—a 2.5-year-old in full-time daycare and a 1-year-old at home. After parental leave, I returned to work since I have the higher earning potential, while my partner resigned to stay home with the youngest. Being mostly alone at home has taken a toll on my partner; they’ve become increasingly depressed and irritated, to the point where even small things trigger anger.

These frustrations aren’t brought up constructively. Instead, 80% of our communication now involves screaming—whether it’s over buying two yoghurts instead of one, the toilet being dirty, or our child wanting to sleep in our bed after a nightmare. During a recent three-week stay with my in-laws, which I used my holiday time for at my partner’s request, I was told that my partner no longer loved me. At another point, they said they no longer found me sexually attractive—despite me being fitter, lighter, and more put together than even before our wedding.

At home, I’ve become a quiet, mindless worker just trying to keep the peace. I wake up early, care for the kids until 7, give them breakfast, make coffee for my partner, and then cycle to work (my partner needs the car for emergencies with the baby). I leave work early, risking my job performance, to get home by 5:30 because my partner finds it too overwhelming to handle both kids alone. We spend the evenings together—playing with the kids, feeding them, bathing them, and putting them to bed—before I collapse next to one of them, exhausted, and repeat the cycle the next day.

I’m falling behind at work, and it’s painful because I’ve always taken pride in my career. If my partner read this, they’d probably say I’m playing the victim. I’ve tried to initiate conversations to address this constructively, but these attempts are brushed off as whining.

My partner is grumpy, depressed and as I learnt during our stay with their family, received no genuine love growing up, which is biting us in the back now. 

The one positive is that we align on parenting and remain civil in front of the kids.  
  
**Question:** I want to rebuild this relationship—I don’t want to throw away everything we’ve built, hurt the kids, or give up on having a united family. But I don’t know how to fix it. We used to work well together, but now we’re stuck, unable to find a way to clear this hurdle.",1,1737329219.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Would you use a place where you could go and focus on training? A place that had a private bay for you to practice, a small indoor green for putting, and some light equipment for working your body? There would be some minor amenities, coffee, tea, water, some small snacks, but the focus wouldn't be food and drink. All of this for an estimated cost of $30-$40/hour. 

Recently moved to Vermont from a state where I was able to play and practice almost daily. After my move to, I found a few indoor sim places to practice, but they are, in my opinion, an expensive option if you just want to go and practice and are not concerned if you can get hot food or beer. Before food and beer these places are charging between $60-$80/hour. I have talked with some golfers in the area, and they say, ""..the prices are not bad if you split it with a few friends."" But what if I just want to go and focus on my slice for an hour or two by myself and get in the zone? What if I want to go try out my 6th driver, because..” this is the one that's gonna make me go pro.” I think it would be nice to have a place solely dedicated to golf and your training.

Looking for any feedback on the feasibility of this quest. Thank you!

It’s been tough but very rewarding. But I’ve been working monthly with a dietician who had me set my own goals, provide encouragement and direction on how to have healthy weight loss. Many of us have posted that Zepbound helps us resist the food noise. I’m one of them. I have no cravings for sugar but really enjoy fresh fruit and vegetables!!! I view Zep as a tool, not a crutch. It refocused my mind on what is most satisfying in other ways. Once I got down to 250, I actually cried when I met with my dietitian because it was a long time since I was at that weight, and I knew I could do it. 

Here’s how I got to this point. 
Logged everything that went in my mouth, except for coffee, tea and water. 
Watched my calories and protein intake. For a 56M 5’7” I have a limit of 1950 calories and 130 grams of protein. Didn’t watch fat/carb intake. 
Exercised slowly first, now I do it 2x a day at least 30 minutes each time and I enjoy it. Even remodeled a room in my basement to accommodate a tv with my recumbent bike and treadmill. (Both giveaways)
Had a lot of friends and coworkers encourage me, once they noticed I was losing weight. But I didn’t share that I was on Zep. I work in a large long term care facility, and it’s also rewarding hearing our residents say, you are looking good, I hardly recognize you anymore.

Ricky Alvarez is a level 8 number cruncher. He has worked at the Industrial Parkway company for the past five years and as he sits behind his desk crunching numbers and cold calling anyone who will give him the time-of-day Ricky thinks there must be more to life than this. A news report comes over the TV and Ricky watches as the reporter Manfeild Smith says that a gelatinous cube is swallowing cars on the freeway. As he stands in the middle of the office watching the TV Ricky wonders who will stop the cube and save the day. Ricky thinks back to the good old days when heroes would go on adventures to save the world and tame dragons, as he thinks about this time from so long-ago Ricky can't help but smile.

 

Out of nowhere his boss, a fat night elf called Illyrio tells him to get back to work and stop wasting time watching TV. The bald, black-skinned elf in his short-sleeved button-down shirt and tie sits in his office smoking ash weed while his employees work hard to make the company money. Ricky is cold calling some wizards to try and sell them some premium staff oil. One of the wizards he calls Magnus the Great an ancient wizard who lived during the time before technology. Magnus is one of the ancient wonders of the world as he is said to have spoken to their god the Dungeon Master. As Ricky is trying to convince this man to buy some staff oil the ancient wizard tells him to stop wasting his time and ask him what he really wants to ask him.

 

Ricky asks the wizard if he'd be willing to meet with him sometime this week and discuss his future. The old wizard laughs and tells Ricky that if the boy wants to have a future, he'll go back to selling staff oil and forget about questing. Ricky makes it clear that he still wants to meet, and he asks Magnus if he knows where the Marble mall is in town. Magnus doesn't answer, he hangs up the phone leaving Ricky to wonder if he will be wasting his time by going to the mall tomorrow. After work, Ricky catches the bus home to his single-bedroom apartment with a communal bathroom and washing machines. At home, Ricky watches The Real Housewives of Elden Hollow and Dance Elves until bedtime. The next morning Ricky wakes up to find it raining so he catches the bus to the mall. He waits at the fountain for an hour before the wizard Magnus, looking like an NBA star in his white tiger print suit with a lion main collar and stylish sunglasses sits down next to him.

 

Magnus is a hairy old man, but he appears to be muscular with a nice tan and gold chain around his neck. The old man asks Ricky why he wants to be an adventurer and for a moment his mind is blank Ricky can't think of one good reason he wants to be an adventurer. As the old wizard gets up to leave Ricky says there has to be more to life than this. Tears ran down his face and Ricky began to cry in the middle of the mall. The wizard tries to comfort him telling Ricky that the time before technology wasn't that great. It was a time when men fought wild beasts, and everyone prayed to the DM to send them a hero to save them from some savage monster. Ricky tells Magnus that he understands how hard life must have been in his day, but he would do anything to taste real adventure, a life free of service where he can be a hero and have influence. Magnus tells Ricky that there's a good chance that he does has an influence he just doesn’t know.

 

Magnus explains to Ricky that every living thing on the planet is important to someone or something else, you need to find that person or thing and keep them close. The wizard getting ready to leave tells Ricky that if he really wants to experience life in the old days, he can go camping with some friends just outside the city. Before he leaves Magnus gives Ricky a coin with the image of a sword engraved on the front and a crown on the back. He tells him to throw it into the water and make a wish. Ricky tosses the coin into the fountain and wishes for the adventure of a lifetime before going home and watching some porn and eating popcorn all night.

 

The next morning Ricky in his tank top and khakis wakes up in the woods. At first, he wonders if he is sleepwalking but after trying for 25 minutes to find the main road and only seeing a dirt road Ricky begins to wonder what is going on. Throwing up near a tree Ricky opens his eyes to find he has just thrown up on the dead body of a medieval peasant. The man was human and as he started screaming someone called out to him a troop of dwarfs with long beards and tools. The dwarfs are miners headed to the mountains to mine for gold and silver and as Ricky explains that he's just found a dead body the Dwarfs share a look as if wondering if Ricky might be crazy. The Dwarfs explain that the man was killed by the necromancer and left in the woods to rot one of the Dwarfs tells Ricky that such things are common since the last great hero died five years ago. Ricky asks where he is and the dwarfs, thinking he might be hung over tell him that the town of Windham is just a mile down the road.

 

The Dwarfs tell Ricky that he can stay at the inn for a few days without paying since it is Marlboro day, and the townspeople will be in the mood to help the less fortunate. Ricky, who's head is still spinning, decides to walk to the town and take his chances at the inn. Ricky, who feels like throwing up again, tries to keep his lunch down as he walks down the road. Ricky who isn't wearing shoes or a shirt begins to shiver as he walks down the road wondering why he isn't wearing a shirt; Ricky dams his night sweats and thinks to himself that he should build a fire. Having worked for Industrial Parkway for five years Ricky remembers going on two companywide camping trips. Yet as he thinks back on those trips, he doesn’t remember anything about building fires or finding shelter.

 

Ricky walks for two miles before reaching the town of Windham. Once he reaches the town Ricky sees a group of orcs commanding men and women into the streets for inspection. The orcs have green and blueish-green skin, and they wear tribal war paint on their exposed chests and faces. The orcs appear to be in service to the necromancer and are in town doing his bidding. The necromancer is level 25, and he has the power to turn the dead into his slaves. Ricky walks into town half-starved hoping for a free meal when he bumps into one of the orcs. The bull orc with his red face paint and hair in a ponytail turns to face Ricky ax in hand. The bulky orc brings his ax down on Ricky's foot taking off his foot entirely Ricky screams as blood gushes from his wound.

 

A knight rushes to Ricky's defense and the orcs and a group of knights begin fighting in the town square. The knights are outnumbered by the orcs two to one. But they put up a real fight against the monster men and are able to force the orcs to retreat. The leader of the knights Sir Willum Guilford picks up Ricky and drags him to the closest inn. Sir Willum orders the tavern owner to fetch a doctor for the injured stranger and the man tells the knight that the town doctor is upstairs sleeping off a day of drinking. The doctor Irving Mud stumbles downstairs half drunk and asks to see his patient. Ricky doesn't remember much about his surgery but the hours of agonizing pain and suffering he felt at the hands of his doctor. Once the surgery is complete Ricky looks down to see he has an iron foot.

 

The foot seems to work but it is heavier than a normal foot and hard to move sometimes. Ricky searches his pockets for anything that might help him survive in this new place and he sees in his pocket the coin that the wizard Magnus gave him. Walking outside to the fountain in the center of town Ricky throws his coin into the fountain and prays to the DM for home. The owner of the Inn tells Ricky he can stay the night but must leave once the sun comes up. Ricky thanks the man and spends his night tossing and turning in a straw-stuffed mattress. In the morning Ricky wakes up back in his apartment, his iron leg still there. Ricky, knowing that what happened wasn't a dream, decides to go to work and forget about adventures for the rest of his life.

 

Back at work, Ricky has a visitor. Illyrio tells Ricky to speak to his guest in the break room, which will count as his break. Walking into the break room Ricky sees the wizard Magnus dressed like a teach billionaire with his glasses and black mock turtleneck. As well as blue jeans that are frayed at the edges. Ricky thanks the wizard for his coin and reaches into his pocket to give it back to him. Finding the coin missing Ricky explains that he used it to get back home, and he doesn't have the coin anymore. Magnus explains to Ricky that the coin should have been returned to his pocket after he used it unless someone picked up the coin after he dropped it in the fountain. Ricky tells Magnus that after he used the coin, he went to sleep and doesn't know if anyone else could have taken it.

 

Ricky after talking with the wizard goes back to work and eats his lunch at his desk. After work Ricky returns home to find his home has been broken into. Calling the police on his cell phone Ricky waits for them to arrive. Forty-five minutes later the police arrive, one of the officers is a Dwarf and the other is a tall thin elf with silver hair. The two officers search the entire house before telling Ricky that the house is empty and asking him if anything is missing. Asking the two officers if they'll come with him inside, while he looks around Ricky sees that the only thing missing is an uncooked ham from his fridge. The police ask if Ricky would like to fill out a report for the ham, but he tells them no and the two officers leave. Ricky goes to bed and at about midnight he is awoken to the sounds of a low humming.

 

As he opens his eyes Ricky is shocked to see fog on the floor of his bedroom. Ricky walks around the house looking for any open windows and stops at his wide-open kitchen window. He looks down at his dinner table at the necromancer who is sitting at his table drinking coffee. The necromancer orders Henry to sit down and talk for a minute. The necromancer cuts an intimidating figure in his hooded robe with satanic runes burned into it. The necromancer's face is hidden by his robes as he explains to Ricky how he has come to be in his world one of his orcs arrives and presents him with a gift. The gift is from a little girl from next door. The half-elf girl is Tix, Ricky's neighbor and she is just six years old. The necromancer is pleased with the girl as her life force will sustain him for a week at best.

 

The girl Tix begins to cry as the orc won't let her go and is holding her arms at her sides. Ricky tells the Necromancer to let the girl go and he can have him instead. The necromancer laughs reminding Ricky that the two of them are adversaries and it would be foolish to kill him so early in the fight. The Necromancer grabs the Tix's hand and begins draining the life out of her. The little girl begins to age at an accelerated rate. Ricky pulls a knife from one of the orcs belts and he stabs the necromancer in the chest. Letting goes of Tix's hand the necromancer, laughing and applauding disappears with his orcs in a puff of smoke. Ricky grabs Tix's hand and she shies away from him the little girl is now a middle-aged woman with graying hair and crow's feet. Her once youthful skin was now wrinkled and aged with time.

 

The next morning Ricky woke up in his bed wondering if last night a dream was. Exiting his house Ricky sees ambulances and the police at the neighbor's door. Asking his friend Micky what happened Ricky is told that little Tix McGuffin got the life drained out of her by a necromancer last night and she has no memory of how it happened. Ricky is now sure that last night wasn't a dream and he goes to work so that he can call Magnus again. The old wizard doesn't pick up and as he is about to give up trying to call the wizard he receives a Witch-Time message from the wizard Magnus. Ricky eagerly picks up the call and tells the wizard what happened to little Tix McGuffin. The wizard listens to Ricky talk and he tells him that he'll have to defeat the necromancer before he takes control of the world.

 

While on his call with Magnus Ricky sees a pack of orcs and a gelatinous cube attacking the city. The cube is swallowing cars and people as the orcs lead it through the city. The police try and contain the gelatinous cube while also trying to stop the horde of orcs from looting stores and banks. The orcs are led by their Chief Pogu. The police try and hold the orcs back until one or more heroes arrive. Ricky looks out the window of his job and sees six winged horses pulling three chariots filled with heroes. One mage and three arches jump off two of the chariots while a barbarian and two knights jump off the last one. Ricky watches the knights and Barbarian as they tare through the orcs while avoiding the gelatinous cube. The mage is able to deal with the cube by mixing a concoction of Liquid Fire.

 

The liquid fire melts away the gelatinous cube turning it into goo. With the cube dealt with the police moved in to help deal with the orcs. Dozens of officers and orcs die in the fighting that precedes the police victory. As ambulances arrive on the scene to help the wounded a thick fog roll in and the dead start to rise. The heroes try and fight off the zombie orcs and police officers, but the dead continue to rise repeatedly after being vanquished. Ricky runs downstairs to warn the heroes about the necromancer, but he is stopped by his boss who reminds him that no one may leave the office while the police are outside. Ricky tries to explain to his boss that he can help the police but his boss refuses to listen.

 

Ricky is forced to sit and watch as the police are overwhelmed by the zombie orcs. One of the officers, a hobbit, knocks on the door to Illyrio's business demanding to be let in. Illyrio refuses to open the door to the wounded officer and Ricky jumps into action. Rushing past his boss Ricky opens the door and pulls the officer inside the little man is grateful. His chestnut brown hair was filled with blood and his leg was broken in two places. The officer tells Ricky that his name is Chester Manwoody, and he has a family, a wife and two children. Illyrio with his thick accent tells Ricky that he is fired for disobeying a direct order. The big round dark elf yells for Ricky to leave his office and never return. Ricky picks up Officer Manwoody and the two turn to

Leave.

 

Another office worker, Carol from the accounting department quits and decides to leave with Ricky. Carol is a night elf, and she knows a secret way out of the building where they can avoid the zombies. Two other workers quit and leave with them as well one Dwarf and a hobbit both named Curtis. The Dwarf is Curtis Short and The Hobbit is named Curtis Lee Young. Carol and Ricky carry Officer Manwoody while the two Curtis's trail behind them. Exiting the office through a back ally the group sticks to the shadows as they make their way home. Curtis calls for a Griffin cab as the group heads towards the cab and black smoke engulfs the Griffin turning it into a zombie. Ricky sees a dead adventurer and he pulls the dead man's sword out of his body.

 

Each of Ricky's friends finds a dead Hero and grabs one of their weapons to defend themselves. Carol grabs a bow and arrow quiver while wearing her button-down dress shirt and skirt Carol fires an arrow at the griffin's face. Curtis the hobbit grabs twin daggers in his blue button-down dress shirt and slacks. He stabs a zombie in the head breaking the curse that binds it to the earth. The Hobbit Curtis yells for everyone to aim for the heads as that will free their souls. Ricky swings his sword at a zombie cutting its head off and as the zombie's body turns to dust people begin to cheer. Men and women from all over the city come to cheer for their new heroes. Curtis the Dwarf reaches for an ax and a zombified hero bites him.

 

A fog rolls in and the Griffin and remaining zombies fade into the mist. Once the fighting dies down the wizard Magnus shows up and tells everyone to gather around him. He introduces the city to its newest band of heroes while simultaneously whispering in Ricky's ear that he must see him before his Dwarf turns into a zombie. The next morning after getting a free coffee from his neighborhood coffee shop Ricky takes Curtis the Dwarf to go see Magnus. The wizard lives at a palatial estate with two Griffin's guarding a hedge maze that surrounds the entire mansion. Ricky and Curtis enter the hedge maze and follow a map given to them by one of the guards at the front gate. Inside the maze, they turn left and right following the map until they reach a crossroad that isn't on the map.

 

Ricky decides to turn around and return to the last place they stopped at but as they turn to go a giant demon worm comes barreling toward them. The skin on Curtis's finger begins to rot as he is now turning into a zombie. Ricky hoping to stop the transformation grabs his friend and runs straight through the hedges with Curtis on his back. The two see Magnus's house in the distance and they sprint toward it. With the demon worm hot on their heels Ricky is forced to run until he can barely breathe. As they reach the front door of Magnus's house, they find the wizard waiting for them with a smile on his face. Ricky warns the wizard about the demon worm and Magnus laughs and tells him the worm is his pet and is very friendly.

 

The worm arrives a moment later and drops a ball at the wizard's feet the towering beast pants rapidly before retreating into the maze. Magnus tells Ricky and Curtis to come inside so they can talk. Curtis watches the flesh rot off his hand, and he screams Magnus gives him a potion and tells him to drink it fast before the cherry flavor wears off. Curtis asks what the potion is supposed to do, and Magnus tells him that in ten seconds it will knock him out. The room begins to spin, and Curtis passes out knocking over a vase as he falls to the ground. Ricky helps the wizard carry Curtis into one of his bedrooms and the two head to his office to speak. Magnus tells Ricky that his friend might be too far gone to help but he might be able to ease his pain before he dies.

 

Ricky tells him that's not good enough reminding the wizard that he promised to help his friend, and he'll have to do something now that they've come to see him. Magnus reflects on what Ricky is saying to him, and he tells the young man to sit tight for a few days while he looks for a cure. Ricky spends the next three days sleeping in a room with a giant eel's head mounted on the wall. Every morning, he visits Curtis who spends his days sleeping as the rot eats away at his flesh. The Wizard Magnus gives Curtis a sleeping potion every night to keep him from screaming in his sleep and on the fourth day he returns with a cure. Mixing some herbs into a poultice Magnus applies them to Curtis's skin while feeding him a potion to stop the infection from overtaking his brain.

 

Curtis awakens to see half his body and part of his face eaten away by zombie rot. Demanding to know what the wizard has done to him Curtis gets out of bed and walks over to Ricky. Ricky tells Curtis that this isn't the wizard's fault he was infected with a zombie virus and was dying. Curtis calms down after hearing that he was about to die but he tells Ricky and the wizard that he wants to be left alone. As he looks himself up and down Curtis sees his flecks of skin attached to his bare bones and he weeps. Curtis looks in the mirror and sees his black beard full of blood and he decides to take a bath before going home. Ricky and the wizard sit at the dinner table discussing what went wrong with Curtis's cure and what they can do to make him feel better.

 

Curtis joins Ricky and Magnus for dinner and the three eat in silence as they eat steamed Kraken tentacles and boar-filled boa buns. After dinner, Magnus shows Ricky and Curtis to the door, and he tells them that if they need to get past the hedge maze all they have to do a call one of the Griffin's for a ride. Returning to his home Ricky falls asleep on his sofa playing video games wondering how he's going to pay his rent. The next morning Ricky is awoken by the sounds of someone knocking on his door answering it Ricky sees that it's Curtis the Dwarf. Curtis explains that his wife and children were terrified of his appearance, so he had to leave home for a while. He asks if he can stay with Ricky for a while and his human friend tells him to come in and relax.   

 

The two men sit on Ricky's couch playing video games until they get a call from Carol who tells them she's signing autographs at the supermarket, and everyone is asking about them. Ricky hangs up and asks Curtis if he'd like to sign autographs down at the supermarket. Pointing to his half-eaten face Curtis tells Ricky that he isn't going anywhere until his skin grows back. Ricky offers to stay with his friend, but Curtis waves him off telling him not to worry as long as he can play Call of Gnomes Online, he doesn't need to ever go outside again. Ricky rushes to meet up with Carol and hobbit Curtis at the supermarket and as he hopes on the bus Ricky is swarmed with his fans. Most of the people just want a picture but one man a night elf tries to take a bite out of Ricky.

 

The people on the bus panic as they are trapped on the bus with a vampire, the monster's pointy fangs glinting in the sunlight as he leaps at Ricky. Unsure how a vampire can survive in the daylight Ricky thinks of another way to kill a vampire, and he remembers that you can pierce the heart with a wooden stake. With no wood on his person Ricky reaches for his sword and is stopped because of the huge crowd on the bus. As he tries to pull his sword Ricky bumps into someone from behind and then he knocks over a Gnome wearing a pointy hat and carrying a pickax. The vampire meanwhile is gutting anyone that stands between him and Ricky. Determined to stop the vampire Ricky finally gets enough room to pull out his sword and he cuts the vampire's head off with a single swing.

 

Getting off the bus, Ricky is confronted by two police officers who demand to know what happened on the bus. Magnus arrives to speak with Ricky, he tells him that if the vampire could withstand sunlight, it must have been at least 600 years old. Magnus tells Ricky that the necromancer must have brought some of his monsters with him into the future. Magnus explains that bringing monsters into the future with him would age the monsters while still keeping them young in appearance. Ricky can't understand what the necromancer wants in their time, and he asks Magnus what the monsters want with them. Magnus tells him that the necromancer is a Class A undead monster in service to a dark god who wishes to bring death upon the earth. Magnus tells Ricky that in order for the darkness to survive it must extinguish the light completely.

 

Ricky asks Magnus what other types of monsters the necromancer can summon, and the wizard tells him that a Class A necromancer can summon armies of ghosts, ghouls, zombies, and vampires. Ricky asks Magnus where the necromancer could hide such a huge army and Magnus tells him that he isn't sure, but his best guess is somewhere in the mountains. The Catskill Mountains are a mountain range near the city of Elden Hollow that surrounds the city in a semi-circle. Magnus walks Ricky to the supermarket where they join Carol and Curtis in signing autographs. That night Ricky and Curtis the Dwarf fall asleep playing video games and smoking Ragweed. Ricky tells Curtis that starting tomorrow they will have to head into the mountains and hunt the necromancer.

 

Asking his friend if he'll join them on their quest to stop the necromancer, Ricky waits for Curtis to respond. The Dwarf tells Ricky that he isn't sure if he should go with them given the circumstances, but he'd still like to help out if he can. Curtis tells Ricky that if he needs help, he can guide him up the mountains to a cave near the peak. Curtis tells Ricky that he will lead them up the mountain using an old Dwarf road. He explains that the Dwarf road was used back in ancient times by Dwarven miners heading up the mountain. Curtis continues to explain that while the road is no longer used to access the mines in the heart of the mountains many Dwarfs still use the paths to head up the mountain for picnics and climbing. The two men talk for a while before going to bed Ricky in his room and Curtis on the couch.

 

The next morning, the adventurers meet at Magnus's house and Officer Chester Manwoody joins them. He and six officers, all elves, agree to accompany the troop up the mountains. Magnus equips the adventurers with outfits for the snow and climbing gear to get up the mountain. Ricky and his troop take a police escort to the base of the mountain before proceeding on foot. Curtis the Dwarf leads the group up the mountain with his ax in hand. Curtis leads the group up the snowy Dwarf road. The adventurers walk until they are met by an old woman wearing a raggedy cloak and carrying a basket. The woman welcomes the adventurers to her home at the top of the mountain and she asks if they'd like to stay for dinner. The old woman leads the group to her cottage past her garden full of vegetables.

 

The four heroes and six police officers sit in the small cottage three on the old woman's bed and the rest scattered around chairs. The old woman stands over her stew pot adding spices and herbs to her food as she cooks a meal for everyone. Once the sun goes down the old woman begins dishing out bowls of stew to everyone in her cottage. The group begins eating after saying a prayer to the Dungeon Master. While eating Officer Manwoody bites into something hard. Pulling the object out of his mouth he sees it’s a child's finger bone. Chester spits the stew out before warning his fellow travelers about what's in the soup. The old woman begins to cackle as even more bones appear in the mouths of the adventurers until they begin to choke on the bones. Curtis the Dwarf is able to pull the bones out of his mouth as the skin on half his face is missing and lifts his ax to attack the witch.

 

The mad witch flies up into the rafters and Curtis swings his ax at the beams cracking them with every swing. One of the beams is so weak that as the witch lands on it the beam collapses burying the witch under a bunch of rubble. As they stop choking Ricky and the rest of the adventurers question the witch about why she attacked them. The witch trapped by the fallen beam her arms pinned down by rubble tells Ricky that word reached her that some adventurers would be coming up into the mountains to hunt a necromancer but what was to stop them from hunting all the evil creatures living on the mountains. Ricky assures the witch that they are only after the necromancer and his army and if she helps them find him, they will free her and pretend she never attacked them in the first place. 

 

 

The witch agrees to their terms and tells them she will lead them to the mountain base where the necromancer prepares his army for their next attack. Ricky thanks the witch and asks her if there is anything they can do for her before they go. She tells them to help her in her garden so she can bring in her harvest. Ricky agrees to help her on the condition that she stop eating children and try to be less evil whenever possible. After helping the witch with her harvest, the group spends the night in her little cottage before waking up at sunrise to follow the map she drew them. Officer Manwoody orders his men to follow at the rear while Ricky leads the adventurers from the front. As he and his men are walking behind the adventurer's Officer Manwoody sees something large come crashing to the ground covered in ice.

 

The ball of ice separates the two groups and as the giant ice ball explodes sending tiny shards of ice flying in every direction a humongous yeti appears between the two groups. The yeti has four arms and as it picks up one of the officers and rips his limbs off Ricky yells out to Officer Manwoody to attack the yeti's eyes so he can blind it. Chester yells for his men to shoot out the yeti's eyes but his four remaining men are terrified and turn to run. Ricky having seen enough charges at the yeti, he stabs the yeti in the chest spilling warm blood on his cold frozen sword. The yeti turns to face him, and it picks him up as it is about to rip him in half. The wizard Magnus arrives and using a fire rain spell burns the yeti in place. Magnus, who is wearing a winter coat, and sunglasses asks why he wasn't invited to the party.

 

Ricky thanks the wizard for saving his life and asks what brought him up the mountain to help them. Magnus explains that his half-sister just got in touch with him and told him that he and his group helped her with her harvest, so the wizard decided to come and return the favor. Ricky can't believe that the wicked witch on the mountain is Magnus's half-sister. The wizard fixes the cracks in the side of the mountain and Officer Manwoody joins Ricky and the adventurers on their quest. Magnus casts a snowstorm spell to ensure that he and the adventurers won't be seen as they approach the cave entrance. Walking toward the cave entrance Ricky sees two Orcs each holding an ax and dagger. The Orcs can't see him as the snowstorm acts as cover but sniffing the air one of the Orcs blows into his horn.

 

Coming out of the cave over three hundred Orcs begin sniffing the air and Ricky begins to panic. The wizard tells him to relax because he's put a plan in motion already. As the orcs continue sniffing the air trying to catch the scent of whatever is driving them crazy, Magnus summons thunder from the sky, and as it strikes one Orc after another the few remaining Orcs turn to run back into the cave. Magnus then takes some of the hair he took from the burned Yeti and creates a bunch of Yeti golems. Using half his magic to create 75 yeti golems Magnus sends them into the cave to cause chaos. The yeti golems tear apart the remaining Orcs and zombies leaving just the Necromancer and his zombie griffin. With his army destroyed the necromancer leaves the cave and comes out to fight.

 

The Necromancer holds up the coin that Ricky threw in the fountain, and he tosses it in the air. The coin disappears and the necromancer tells Ricky that he has just sent the coin back in time to the creation of light and darkness as a gift to the Dark god of creation. The necromancer laughs hysterically and then casts his bones to see his future. Pulling out some of his ribs the necromancer throws his bloody ribs at Magnus and the adventurers. Magnus puts up a shield to keep the bones from touching anyone and he yells for his group to watch out as the bones have a curse attached to them and they cause bleeding damage. The griffin fly's overhead trying to blow the adventurers off the cliff face. Ricky pulls something out of his pocket, it is a 20-sided die and as he rolls it a golden bow pops out of the die as it expands to give up its gift.

 

Ricky throws the bow and golden arrows to Carol who takes aim at the griffin's wing and fires her arrow. As the arrow leaves the bow it creates an explosion of golden light as it tears off the griffin's wing and half the undead monster's body. The necromancer watching his creation die pulls out some more of his ribs and uses them as claws. He tells the wizard that even though he will die darkness will live on. The necromancer takes his claws and runs them across his throat killing himself.

 

Three weeks after the necromancer's death Ricky and his friends are enjoying a meal with the president of the free world when a giant black eye with a golden iris appears in the sky. The eye blinks twice before blocking out the sun. To be continued. ",1,1737328934.0,shortstorywriting,0,1.0,False

The book is first person and the character talks very informally, she is in an abusive relationship and has conflicting views on her abuser because of that. Stockholm syndrome and all that jazz. I’m making this very brief just so there’s context. 
I’ve laid out the conflicting views she has of this person as a conversation. Normal text for against the abuser and italics for the one who still loves them. This happens nearly 100 pages in and this conversation layout is only for one scene. 

However, would this make the reader think my character hears voices and is crazy? I mean she kinda is, but not to the point of hearing voices. It’s just herself talking and kinda breaking off into separate view points. When referring to the voices though, I’m referring to them as ‘they’ but have made it clear it’s the protagonist’s thoughts having a conversation with each other. The voices say the words ‘us’, ‘you’ and ‘we’ when talking to each other

Should I keep the layout like that or have it all in one paragraph? I think having it in one paragraph would still show these different thoughts but be more confusing to read, but would also more accurately show that it’s my protagonist thinking and not having voices in her head.

I’m looking to connect with other women in Paris or nearby areas. I live about an hour away but I’m happy to travel! I’m 23F and currently have just one friend in Paris, so I’d love to meet new people and grow my social circle. I moved here in November last year and sometimes feel a bit lonely.

I’d also love to practice languages—my English is around B1-B2, and I’m a complete beginner in French (A1 haha). I speak Spanish too!

It would be great to grab a coffee, go for a walk, or do something fun during the morning or early afternoon, as I usually have language classes in the evening.

My first BWCA trip in 2022 was with three friends and fully outfitted by an Ely outfitter. This year, I decided to handle everything myself—route planning, gear, and adding more fresh food. Since some friends and I already backpack, we only needed to rent canoes. My goal was to bring five people, but I ended up with seven, including three who flew in. While the larger group was exciting, it came with challenges, especially on this route. I chose a loop out of Clearwater Lake (renting canoes through Clearwater Outfitters) for its unique scenery along the border and convenient travel logistics.

**Day 1 of 7: Saturday, August 24, 2024**

Today was the drive to Clearwater Historic Lodge & Outfitters in Grand Marais, MN, excited to explore the Gunflint Trail. Our group of eight (all early 30s) arrived in three waves.

My hometown friend (visiting from San Diego) and I left Appleton, WI, at 8:45 AM and reached Clearwater by 6 PM, with a key stop at the Holiday gas station in Tofte, MN, for leeches. The Milwaukee Mischiefs (two college friends) arrived around 7:30 PM after a longer drive than ours, though it looked like they might beat us at one point. The Madison Crew (four high school friends) had the longest journey, picking up members flying into Minneapolis before arriving around 9 PM.

Clearwater Outfitters was stunning, with beautiful views of the lake and palisades, but the laid-back vibe felt a bit unusual. The bunkhouse, far simpler than the one we had in Ely, was a surprise for everyone. With heat, humidity, and at least two snorers, we knew sleep would be a challenge.

The quiet here made it feel like wilderness already. Once settled, we walked the property, checked out gear, and waited for the others. When everyone arrived, excitement and nervousness were in the air. Stories, laughs, and Wisconsin-required beverages carried us late into the night—delaying the inevitable attempt to sleep in the bunkhouse.

**Day 2 of 7: Sunday, August 25, 2024**

Our trip officially began with a hearty breakfast at Clearwater Outfitters. Though I wasn’t initially impressed with the outfitter, their hot meal and cozy lodge redeemed them. Our group of eight shared laughs over breakfast before packing our gear. As the trip leader, I take responsibility for the lengthy process—overpacking food “just in case” made deciding what to bring a challenge.

We hit the water around 11 AM, aiming to camp at Mountain Lake. Paddling out of Clearwater was stunning, with palisades in view and the wind occasionally at our backs. The portage to Mountain Lake, though short, included an uphill trek. After the portage, we enjoyed a delicious outdoor lunch of cheese curds, mozzarella whips, and smoked salmon—a far cry from the bland spaghetti we endured last time.

Continuing East on Mountain Lake, we hoped to snag site 721 or 717 to fit our group. Unfortunately, the first three sites were taken, and while the 4th was open, it couldn’t accommodate our four tents. We finally settled on site 722—a small, elevated spot with a strenuous hike to the latrine. Some of the group explored Pemmican Lake (unsuccessfully), while others fished along the rocky shoreline, catching small bass and northern pike.

Dinner was a classic: fresh steaks, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. Cooking eight steaks over the fire proved challenging, with only half turning out well despite using quality ribeyes and New York strips. As much as I love steak, this will be the last time I attempt it on a trip—it’s just not worth the effort.

**Day 3: Monday, August 26, 2024**

Another hot, humid night meant poor sleep, and the damp conditions made finding dry firewood nearly impossible. Breakfast—bacon, farm-fresh eggs, and hashbrowns—provided much-needed energy for the day ahead.

We set out for Moose Lake, enjoying the elevated scenery and joking about paddling border lakes. Leaving Mountain Lake, we faced three portages. The first, to Fan Lake, was a muddy slog, but the second portage was worse, with knee-deep muck. At the end of the first portage, we met ""Detroit John,"" a solo paddler who was on the same route. While initially worried about competing for campsites, his scouting would later prove helpful.

After the final portage to Moose Lake, we paused for a lunch of hummus and pita bread before paddling onward. Moose Lake was busy, with every site seemingly full. Stress began to mount, but Detroit John scouted ahead and confirmed the last site (743) was open and suitable for our group. Grateful, we set up camp.

The site was larger than the previous night's but had limited flat tent spots and poor fishing access. Dinner was chicken fajitas with Spanish rice—a meal I’d been nervous about preparing but turned out to be a hit.

Exhausted from the day's challenges, most of the group turned in early. Light rain and distant heat lightning marked the end of the night, thankfully without storms.

**Day 4: Tuesday, August 27, 2024**

Another humid night made for uncomfortable sleep, a common Midwest camping frustration. Breakfast—bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns—was quick and satisfying despite the greasy cleanup. Concerned about finding campsites, we decided to move faster than previous days.

The paddle from Moose Lake to North Fowl Lake was challenging, with muddy, foul-smelling portages. To avoid the worst of it, some of us paddled out while waiting for the group. We ran into Detroit John again, who shared his plans to camp on John Lake. Friendly paddlers nearby were a comforting presence.

Passing through the Fowl Lakes, the sight of cabins—and a running chainsaw—dampened the wilderness vibe. Shallow, grassy waters forced us to walk canoes to the Royal River. Paddling through Royal Lake’s dense weeds was exhausting, but we eventually reached John Lake. The first site was taken, but we secured the peninsula site (747), which was perfect for our group with ample space and good fishing access.

Lunch was pita bread with cheese and salami, toasted over the fire for an added touch. Spirits lifted as we settled in. Fishing yielded a few pike, and we worked together to build a much-needed third bench for the site.

Dinner was a “redemption spaghetti,” complete with noodles, homemade sauce, Italian deli meatballs, and garlic fry bread. It was a warm, hearty meal that surpassed our disastrous first BWCA spaghetti in 2022. While eating, a father and young daughter passed by in search of a site. We debated offering them space but ultimately decided against it, unsure if our group’s dynamic would be suitable. In hindsight, I’d offer next time.

The evening was spent warming by the fire, with cloudy skies obscuring the stars. Given the crowded route, we mapped out plans for tomorrow. Aiming for West Pike Lake, we agreed to push farther to secure one of its excellent campsite.

**Day 5: Wednesday, August 28, 2024**

Finally, with cooler temps and less humidity, I had a good night's sleep. Breakfast was oatmeal to get moving quickly. With two big portages ahead, we aimed to avoid site battles.

The portage to East Pike Lake was the longest at 210 rods, but the trail was smooth. The wind pushed us toward West Pike, making for a fast paddle. We noticed at least one group camping on East Pike. After the West Pike portage, we discussed which sites to target. The island site (2017) was the top choice, but Detroit John had claimed it.

We settled on site 726, my top pick for West Pike. It turned out to be perfect—spacious with tall pines and great water access. The rocky, wind-sheltered shoreline provided a stunning spot to enjoy the warm weather.

Our spirits soared as we arrived. With only one portage left, we had the best campsite of the trip. Dinner was chili prepared by a friend who dehydrated all ingredients. Despite initial doubts, it turned out excellent.

That evening, we experienced the clearest sky with an unparalleled star display. Countless shooting stars and a view of the Milky Way created a magical moment. Standing on the rocks, gazing upward in awe, was an unforgettable experience—hard to capture in photos but deeply felt.

**Day 6: Thursday, August 29, 2024**

It’s the coldest morning of the trip, and I’m regretting forgetting base layers, a hat, and gloves. The forecast never predicted it would drop below 50, so I thought I’d be fine. After a chilly start, I slept in—much needed. Mid-morning, breakfast sandwiches and coffee were delivered. Can’t get much better than that.

Today is the first with no set plans—a slow, lazy day around camp. Talk of day trips was minimal, though one canoe checked out Gogebic Lake. Naps, lounging, journaling, and wood gathering filled the time. Fishing was a highlight with many casts from the rocky shoreline, sparking thoughts of “how many Mepps are at the bottom of this lake?”

By mid-afternoon, rain was forecasted overnight. We put up the rain flys and kept an eye on the weather with Garmin updates. Despite the wind, Brandon’s Bay, sheltered from the gusts, felt 10+ degrees warmer than the main site. This is where I began writing this report. Watching my friends cast on the bay, I started journaling and suddenly noticed the bobber disappearing. Grabbing the rod, I reeled in my first fish—a smallmouth bass! An incredible moment, and even better, it was eating-sized. Could we fry some fish tonight?

Dark clouds rolled in, but no rain was forecasted until tonight. Out of nowhere, we had a brief 10-minute rain shower. Camp was quickly tidied, and the fire maintained as we returned to fishing and dinner prep. Caught a few more smallmouth—eating size, but nothing special. Dinner tonight was lovingly dubbed ""chef's surprise,"" featuring mac with ground beef, dehydrated and seasoned by our friend. Delicious.

As the sun set, we hoped for one more fish to ensure a decent portion for everyone. Finally, one of us threw a Hail Mary cast and landed a nice smallmouth—enough for a fish fry!

It’s hard to believe it’s our last night. The storm arrived as we began cleaning and frying the fish in light rain. The fish tasted amazing, and the rain made for a fitting end to the trip. After packing up, we headed to bed as the rain picked up. Despite the weather, we would’ve stayed up late if it were nicer out. These moments are too precious to end.

**Day 7: Friday, August 30, 2024**

The last day of the trip brought a somber mood to camp. We took a group picture before our final portage to Clearwater Lake and back to the outfitter—another 200+ rod portage. While some say portages get easier towards the end, that only applies if you’re carrying a food pack. This one, however, was a beast.

Getting on Clearwater Lake, the wind was relentless, pushing hard against us. It was the toughest paddle I’ve ever done, draining every ounce of energy. It took nearly 4-5 hours to cross the lake—brutal and demoralizing. It was the worst way to end the trip.

One canoe stopped at the put-in point and WALKED their gear back to the outfitter—it was that bad. As we made our way back at different times, one vehicle headed home, while the rest waited for them. We shared a post-trip meal in Grand Marais before heading our separate ways. I stayed in Duluth with my friend for the night, while another car did the same in the Twin Cities.

Overall, it was a fantastic trip, and I hope we can take on the next adventure together.

Anyway, there’s this girl that I like which I haven’t known for too long. We work in the same profession but different places. I first met her at kind of a network meeting (both our places of work fall under the same trust) didn’t really talk to her at all but did communicate briefly through email. 

Last week as part of a wider network meeting she was there (I wasn’t aware she was gonna be there) there were like 4 different locations you could be at. Anyway coincidentally I ended up sitting next to her for this thing, ended up talking to her for the 2 and a half hours mainly about work. Towards the end I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee, she initially said no. A few minutes later she turns around and changes her mind. We leave this thing, she mentions that she only has 20 minutes before her bus. We grab a coffee and were there longer than 20 minutes probably around 40 ish. It was genuinely one of the best conversations I’ve had in a long time. I ended up asking for number which she said she had recently changed it and couldn’t remember it off the top of her head. But then she gave me her phone to put my number in (didn’t ask her to do that). 

But she never texted me… I also never asked her too (I should’ve have). Quite disappointed by that because I could tell we were quite similar and just how we got on. 

I emailed her the next morning which she mentioned she totally forgot (Not sure if it was genuine) but even replies to that were vague. I will add that she seems very work driven and professional in that sense. 

We have another network meeting in just over a week - I don’t know if she is gonna be there. I’m hoping to just be straight up with her and tell her that I like her? (That’s worded poorly but too that affect). But if she isn’t then what can I do? There’s a chance that I wouldn’t see her again and if I do it won’t be for a while. 

For context, a couple of my friends who are female can’t work this out. One thinks she’s not interested and another thinks that she’s just oblivious and doesn’t realise I’m trying to get to know her. My gut tells me she’s not interested but I don’t know that was the first time I’ve properly spoken to her.  ",1,1737328217.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I am a customer of a nonprofit that serves teas and coffees in a bar/hangout setting for people in recovery (the reason given for their nonprofit status). I believe that this is a fraudulent nonprofit, based on my experience in business operations and ethics. I would like to state that this business is extremely active, and based on my math, they are pulling in roughly $5k a day after expenses and overhead. I have reviewed their 990’s and they are all over the place. They only file every 3 years (4 is the max before you start to catch attention) and I believe that this is an effort to conceal their finances. Their expenses that I could verify have been inflated by 3-10x on their financials, specifically rent, at 10x what they pay for the space. There are several directors, and they claim to be receiving no compensation on their 990’s. I know these people, and I do not believe that that is the case. 

There is a second location sharing the name and branding, with a slight difference in wording, that was opened later, in a nearby neighborhood. It is registered as an LLC and is owned by the directors of the nonprofit. Watching them receive supplies (everything they brew/use/consume), I have observed that the nonprofit is purchasing the supplies and driving them to the LLC, at which point cash is paid for the supplies and provided to the registered business, bought secondhand from the nonprofit. 

I would assume that all expenses are being run through the nonprofit as a tax scheme, and the cash transactions are going into the pockets of the “nonprofit directors/business owners” based on a mutual agreement and split. I cannot prove this, but it’s obvious. I think that everyone can read into the other problems with the nonprofit specifically. 

 I would like to take these people down. I have filed complaints with the governing bodies at state and federal levels, and nothing has been done/I haven’t received a response. What is the best way to shut down this scheme? It’s not my business, but nonprofit fraud aggravates me greatly as a former nonprofit director and a person that works with vulnerable populations as my current career.

Avignon, a city steeped in history and charm, sits proudly on the Rhône River in Provence, France.  Famous for its incredible medieval ramparts and the magnificent Palais des Papes (Palace of the Popes), it’s a destination that effortlessly blends historical significance with undeniable beauty. This guide will help you plan your exploration of this fascinating city.


**Stepping Back in Time: Walking the City Walls**

The best way to truly appreciate Avignon is to walk its impressive ramparts.  These ancient walls, dating back to the 14th century, offer breathtaking panoramic views of the city, the Rhône, and the surrounding countryside.  Take your time; it's a leisurely stroll with plenty of opportunities for stunning photos.  There are several access points, so you can choose a section that suits your time and energy levels. Remember comfortable shoes – those cobblestones can be a bit uneven!

**The Palais des Papes: A Palace of Power and History**

The Palais des Papes is the undisputed star of Avignon.  This colossal Gothic palace served as the residence of the Popes during the 14th century, a period known as the Avignon Papacy.  Prepare to be awestruck by its sheer scale and the intricate detail of its architecture.  Explore its vast chambers, chapels, and courtyards; each space whispers tales of power, intrigue, and religious influence.  A guided tour is highly recommended to fully appreciate the historical significance of this incredible building.

Get lost (in a good way!) in its charming, narrow streets, discover hidden squares, and admire the beautiful architecture.  Avignon is a delight for those who love to wander and stumble upon unexpected gems.

**Must-See & Do in Avignon:**

* **Pont d'Avignon (Saint-Bénezet Bridge):** Though only partially standing, this iconic bridge is instantly recognizable and a must-see. Its history is as captivating as its appearance.
* **Place de l'Horloge:**  This lively square, with its striking clock tower, is a vibrant hub of activity. It's a perfect place to grab a coffee or lunch and soak up the atmosphere.
* **Musée du Petit Palais:** This museum houses an impressive collection of paintings from the Avignon School, offering a fascinating insight into the region's artistic heritage.
* **Enjoy Provençal Cuisine:** Indulge in the delicious flavors of Provence.  From fresh seafood to hearty stews, Avignon's restaurants offer a delightful culinary experience.


**Planning Your Trip:**

* **Best time to visit:** Spring and autumn offer pleasant weather and fewer crowds. Summer can be very hot.

Avignon is more than just a city; it's a journey through time. Its blend of historical significance, architectural beauty, and vibrant culture makes it an unforgettable destination. So, pack your bags, and prepare to be captivated by the magic of Avignon and the Palais des Papes.

But! The weak imports from the warm states who whine when it drops below +60°F drive me NUTS and I kind of really hope that this proper cold either makes them A) appreciate the moderate temperatures for what they are, B) leave, or at the very least, C) don't constantly whine at length about the weather. 

-------

Commenting on the weather, short discussions on recent/future /historical weather, snarking about how your nose/cheeks/fingers/toes almost fell off, talking about how the weather affects your house/your yard/the crops, stuff like that, that's all totally fine.

But going on long whiny tirades is obnoxious. Like, Reighley, I'm at the coffee maker to get coffee before work. We're seven minutes into your whining while I politely listen. Please catch the hint I am not enjoying your story, GTFO of the way to the coffee, and let me escape to get to work.

-------

There are tradeoffs to everything, it's silly to expect otherwise, and obnoxious and entitled to loudly whine about it!

You want all the good things about Minnesota? Pay the piper and face the subzero temps, cowards!

That doesn't mean you have to be outdoorsy, but whining at length about how it's so much warmer in California, and doing it on the daily is obnoxious. You weren't coming in blind, our weather is WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I am a customer at a tea and coffee bar for people in recovery that does an incredible amount of business. I am a former operations director for a nationally recognized cultural nonprofit. I now work with vulnerable populations on a 1x1 basis. 

I’ve reviewed this nonprofit’s 990’s, and the expenses that I can verify are being inflated by about 10x. 990’s are only being filed every three years, with the max allotted time allowed being 4 years to file. I believe that this is an effort to conceal their finances. The “directors” do not claim any compensation, however I know them well and they are definitely living a lavish lifestyle with obviously no other employment or income streams. The 990’s reflect consistent annual losses to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars. I cannot stress enough how much business this nonprofit location actually does - don’t think “coffe bar”, think “large sports bar that is always packed” with drink prices to match. 

There is a separate location using a slightly different name and the same branding that is a town over, registered as an LLC. The directors of the nonprofit are the owners of this LLC. I am aware that all supplies and expenses (to the tune of tens of thousands a month) are being purchased in cash from the nonprofit, as both a tax scheme and a way to pocket the cash from the business for the supplies directly - essentially laundering money from the business and also avoiding taxes on the supplies. The supplies are then reflected as an expense to the nonprofit. 

I have reached out to the governing authorities at the state and federal level, but my only response received has been to “chat with the people in charge of these businesses”. I would rather hit them hard and make them run an honest business or shut them down.

We are just so ecstatic to visit- it seems like PR has everything you could possibly want in an island getaway! There is so much we want to do and see. I feel like I am already planning my second trip back to see what I won't be able to see in a week lol. Below is our rough itinerary, any insight and advice is so appreciated!!

  
Day 1. Fly into San Juan, arrive around 11pm, get rental car and stay in Carolina for ease. 

Day 2. Wake up, explore San Juan, drive to Rincon and explore cuevo del indio along the way. Possibly stop at the Lighthouse and La Pozo Del Obizpo in Arecibo. Arrive at our lil surf bungalow in Rincon that evening. 

Day 3. Rincon! Surf lessons and surf.

Day 4. Rincon, surf, thurs night art walk. Maybe drive out to aguadilla and cascada gonzalandia while there. 

Day 5. Drive to Rio Grande. Make pit stop near Utuado for Caguano Indigenious Ceremonial Center. Also wondering if it may be worth it to spend the day at Tanama River and caving? It will definitely make for a long day, but it looks incredible. Really wanted to visit a coffee farm but I don't think we can make it happen.

Day 6. Visit El Yunque. Stay in rio grande. Is El Yunque worth it? I've read it is majorly crowded (by people like me lol) so I'm just curious if it's as amazing as it seems. 

Day 7. Ferry to Culebra from Ceiba. I got tickets for 9am-6:30pm. Or should we take a catamaran to icacos instead? I'm torn! We really just want a nice beach day, some snorkeling. Dinner at luquillo kiosks, drive to Carolina for close stay to airport

Day 8. Fly out at 7:30 am and leave paradise :( 

  
Is this all too much for a week? What would you add, what would you cut? 

I've been brushing up on my very rudimentary Spanish for the past few weeks and plan to continue up until we leave, I'll be bringing cash, getting the toll pass for the car, and bringing a microfiber towel for my suitcase so we are always beach ready!

It opened with three different songs, the first one had nice messages but the other two were a bit odd. One was talking about His blood, and didn’t mention Jesus once. The other one was talking about how His name is higher than all, greater than all, etc. It was oddly focused on His name and didn’t say anything about what He did. 

Other than that, I did enjoy it. I’m not trying to be negative or anything, just figured I’d share a little experience. But above all, I prefer The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

I’m a 22M who recently got a body scan at Cult with my friends. I thought my body fat percentage would be around 30-33%, but it went up to **44%**! I was shocked.

Here’s some context:

* A year ago, I weighed 80kg while working a WFH internship.
* Moved to Bangalore for a new job in July and weighed 85kg. My office hours are 11:30am - 7:30pm, 5 days a week...

* Over the last 8 months, my weight has only gone up by 2-3kg, but my body fat seems to have increased a lot. My shirts don’t fit well anymore, I wear hoodies/pullovers to office and I’m super self-conscious, especially about my thighs in light-colored pants.

I need advice on two things:

# 1. Workout Routine

* Started working out again from Jan 6.
* Doing a 2 muscle group/day routine.
* Struggling to lift more than 7.5-10kg dumbbells.
* Can’t do a single push-up. (I have never been able to do a push-up in my life)

# 2. Diet Issues

Here’s my current diet:

* **Breakfast:** Banana, 2 boiled eggs, black coffee with honey. 
* **Lunch:** Office mess (2 rotis + chicken/paneer) or chicken fried rice; sometimes just a fruit bowl.
* **Pre-workout:** Whatever I can find in the office, but I still feel low on energy.
* **Post-workout:** I order 1 L milk every alternate day, so 500mL/day in protien shake.
* **Dinner:** Used to cook 450g butter chicken/paneer with 3-4 rotis but started ordering from swiggy/zomato (Leon's, KFC, etc.) after Diwali. Also crave something sweet to sleep, like a DBC 💀💀💀. I can't fall asleep on an empty stomach... I need to eat minimum 2-2.5 rotis before bed...

I’ve been stress eating due to a toxic manager (good news: they were fired this January, and my new manager is great!).

1i5bjd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i5bjd5/the_dating_culture_in_the_west_suffers_from_the/,The dating culture in the west suffers from the economic system,"The opinion is likely unpopular for the west and the online community. 

Background- from post ussr countries. I want to give an insight into dating culture in Slavic and Central Asian countries as that’s what I grew up in, where my ancestors and family are from, where majority of my friends are from.
The youth (teens-20s) are more westernised and the dating scene is a little more similar to what you guys have but that's exclusive to the big city more affluent circles.

I don't nessecarily agree with the following but that's just how it is. Even if I find it wrong it's accepted by all.

Here's how dating and marriage worked for people throughout the 20th century in cities, for our great grandparents, grandparents and parents. 
A man and a woman like each other, meeting via work/friends/school/relatives. The man asks her out, dates at early stages of relationships rarely were 1 on 1. The guy brings couple of friends and so does the girl, not for them to date each other but as a background. 
An ice cream, movie, theatre or even a walk grabbing something to eat. The friends allow the guy who asked out to pay for the girls, and sometimes everyone too. For him to be able to show how courteous/generous and a great guy overall he is. A period of courtship, he brings her little gifts and for her friends as well. Most I heard is oranges/lemons/flowers/chocolate. Having sex before marriage wasn't a norm, unheard of for teens, but some 20 year olds still did. 
Soon after dating for a year or so proposal. They marry. 

A small aside- For most USSR countries culturally even before 20th century, autonomous on their own, there was no 'stay at home wife/breadwinner husband' unless filthy rich but in the rich case both didn't work. Jobs were generally different for a man and a woman but they couldn't afford not to work. USSR encouraged everyone to work all the same. My great grandmother was a head of construction site and other great grandfather was a head of flour factory. 
Grandmothers- bookeeper and a languages teacher, grandfathers- phd scientist later government worker and after the fall of the union small business owner and the other a miner turned politician turned nurse.

A marriage ideally approved by families, youth still did go against the parental wishes but that was ground for conflict.
After the marriage, early-mid 20s they had children.
The husband, unrelated to his income, has to earn not only for his family (wife+kids) but also for her side of the family and his own.
Not an unreasonable amount especially if you're freshly working but a chunk always went. The wife usually controlled the finances, even if both worked she had most of the household chores. Again not unreasonable amount, especially since relatives helped and it was normal for the young couple to co habit a house with parents. A good husband also helped around as well. The kids were most involved as both parents worked they had school, housechores and then could hangout with friends/attend clubs (sports/arts) 

If the husband wasn't financially helping both of the relative sides he wasn't taken seriously. Again not an unreasonable amount. Most young families didn't have much but still contributed and helped each other out, parents and relatives helped to buy a house etc. 
If the guy wasn't hard working then he would get laughed at, family and friends, the girl would also get laughed at for being with such man. 

Nowadays it is different, globalisation and all.
Here's the difference-
There are couples where the wife stays at home because the husband earns enough to afford that. She doesn’t do most household chores though, there's help as in staff.

The man is still the one bringing most income but that's threshold. It doesn't make him exceptional or 'high value' 
A good woman won't choose an expensive place for their dates or ask for expensive gifts of course. If the woman does so it's also frowned upon.

We have couples of the old rich guy and a young beautiful woman but they aren't taken seriously, just like everywhere else.
Transactional and shallow.

In Russia there is a new term 'tareloçnica' for women who go on dates to get free food but it’s a result of internet exposure, globalisation and poorer youth. Wasn't a thing until recently.

The standards are different, women are more well kempt and pay more attention to their looks. For a man if he's 'slightly more handsome than a monkey' then it’s alright.
The regular 'I want my girlfriend shorter/boyfriend taller' is present.

The way you hold yourself/behaviour plays into your attractiveness more than the physical features for most elders (used to be like that different nowadays)

There used to not be a rigid beauty standard, elders (40 and above to be frank) generally compliment as in 'well presenting' 'tidy' ''stately' and the cultural long living standards. This is more specific, country by country.

Couple also cohabitate together before marriage as well (dependant on the country tbf, ukraine and russia more lax on that but kyrgyzstan or uzbekistan it's taboo)

Mental health nowadays, for all, is shit though. 
Many men drink or cheat. As a result of health neglect suffer from early death. 'Man up' culture
Many women become billous husks. Unfulfilled and dependant.
Both resent each other to a certain extent. 
Marital, domestic abuse is a thing but not as common as you might believe. Also frowned upon but if you go to police or family they will say 'it's your familial issue just resolve it' 

Usually couples truly are in love as even with the family opposing they still are together, in poor and rich.


I personally don't participate in dating because I feel uncomfortable with the idea of a person paying for me but I also dislike the western dating scene as well. 
How I feel is abnormal and a result of westernization.
My family would never accept a guy who doesn't provide fully for me and also help his and my family financially even if I' working as hard as he is. 
It's the same for all people my age and older, younger in the big cities it's different and more like you guys are used to.

Friends who are men just laugh when I bring it up the bill splitting I had with my European dates, it's just natural for them (indocrination probably haha), I trust my brothers to choose good partners. Feel sad that they, growing up in a family where the the idea of 'duties' wasn't puched AT ALL. Have the need from just seeing their friends and families to also do the same, but they 'What about it' when I suggest otherwise.

 What I am trying to say is that you, the women and the men, should appreciate each other. Not your fault.
Wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the wages and costs of living.
It's ridiculous to demand expensive gifts early into dating or without the financial abiltiy to do so.
What I saw living in the west for a few years now, all of the young people aren't paid well, very focused on the monetary side because of it. It’s natural not want to pay for a date when you know that the wage is barely covering rent and groceries. 
Wrong that even a cinema date is so expensive.
It’s important to be aware and concious of your partners financial situation. 
I also don't think that a standard for having a partner who takes care of themself is absurd. Just be realistic, it is absurd to expect a billionaire or megan fox. 

I aspire for a world where a man or a woman can be generous and pay for their friends and partners. It’s human to want to share and take care of people. It is inhumane that we cannot do so.
Women/Men aren't the enemy but the rich fucks are. The shareholders cutting where they can and withholding the money to add to their billions is unnatural and actively damaging to the dating scene. I think that's why the younger generation focuses more on the looks and body as that’s somewhat possible to control and change to offer. 
Focusing on ticking off 'type' boxes of requirements is silly.
A person is a person. The nature, character and soul. We all age and get wrinlkly. Companionship stays. 



Would you be so opposed to paying (men or women) if you knew you were comfortable to do so? 

Edit: forgot the gay couples, if it’s a man/man or woman/woman pairs then in my countries they face issues much more serious than who pays for the coffee on the second date haha. More egalitarian I suppose. Less gender norms.

1i5bj2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1i5bj2v/fly/,Fly....,"	The trains rattled and clacked on the nearby tracks, and the sky seemed to glow, as only a desert sky can with its thin dry air. There was never a cloud in the sky. 

The desert is a strange and wonderful place. Even with all the wonders and modern conveniences, the ancient barrenness of the desert makes you feel small, temporary, and insignificant. There is ruthlessness in the desert, as if the sand, the wind, the grit, and the dunes constantly whisper to you that they have been killing people in this area for thousands of years and don’t plan to stop anytime soon.

The moon shone down on the homeless shelter on the outskirts of Yuma, Arizona. The official curfew was 9 p.m., but it was after 3 a.m. 

Most of the homeless, the destitute, the addicted, and the desperate were sleeping. Dinner had been served, and after dinner tobacco was used by those who could afford it, begged for it, or had stolen it.

The mission served a purpose, in so much as it gave the homeless a place to sleep, a community of sorts, and a centralized place to pool available public resources for the poor, the addicted, the refugees, and the mentally ill.

It’s not perfect because there are so many reasons that a person might feel lost, forgotten, or at the bottom, and these feelings are what bring people like us to places like this.

On this night Solomon and Scott were outside having a smoke and passing a bottle of Black Velvet Canadian whiskey back and forth. Both stayed at the shelter for different reasons but somehow had become more than associates and probably as close to friends as a couple of old formerly homeless dead-beats could get.

 Our commonalities kind of drew us into the same circles. We were both refugees of bad relationships, suffered from moderate depression, and didn't quite fit in. Neither of us was addicted to anything in particular but could become obsessed with anything at any given time. 

The difference between addiction and obsession is that when the obsessed are done with something or someone they are simply done. We put it down, walk away, and never look back. This is a good quality regarding mind-altering substances, but a horrible quality when it comes to relationships, careers, family, or most other things.

Like a couple of old dogs that turned in circles a few times before settling down, Scott and I had made ourselves useful and managed to get real beds in the dormitory, part-time jobs, and a place to hang our hats. Management didn't expect much from us, and we didn't give them much in return. 

Good business for a couple of vagabonds.

Scott was the kitchen auditor. His job was to write down what the kitchen used in frozen commodities from the freezer and keep some semblance of inventory. These records were saved and used for inventory control and applying for grants. He worked a few hours 6 days a week, collected some money on the 1st, and lived without expenses or expectations.

My job title was graveyard fire watch. From midnight to six a.m., I answered phones, stayed awake, and called 911, if something happened that I deemed an emergency.

Like Scott, I received a monthly check, was left alone, and received room and board. It’s not much but it’s enough for a couple of old men, hiding out from life below the radar, and just trying to stay invisible in the meaty part of the curve.

I know this because we do it every night at about 3 a.m., when Scott comes out of the dormitory for a break from completing his kitchen audits and after taking the meat out of the freezer that will be cooked and fed later that day. 

We have a drink mostly because we can. We're one of only a few people on the premises who aren't drug addicts or recovering alcoholics. Drinking alcohol is of course strictly forbidden but we do it anyway, it's just our way of being rebellious I suppose.

Everybody's asleep except me and Scott. I have the cordless phone for the shelter in my pocket and we're sitting on the back loading dock. I’m smoking a cigarette and we’re passing the bottle back and forth, two times, only two, it’s like our ritual. 

At some point in Scott's life, he has had a stroke. He's also in his seventies and suffers from neuropathy or whatever it's called when you can't feel your fingers that good. Of course, he doesn't talk to his doctor that much about it. He takes gabapentin a fistful at a time on the days he remembers and that's about it. 

He read an article somewhere that said if he tosses a ball from hand to hand it will help with his coordination and may help with his neuropathy. For some reason instead of seeing a doctor and doing what the doctor recommends he decided to treat his condition with this small, red, rubber ball. The ball is smaller than a tennis ball and made of solid foamed rubber. It's not hard enough to break a window or hurt someone if it hits them. It’s a ball you would throw teaching your dog to play fetch.

The two of us are out at the loading dock. I’m smoking and walking back and forth while he sits on the dock, with his legs dangling. He's tossing the ball from hand to hand. I'm chatting with him about something and he's ignoring me and focusing on this ball. Attempting to distract him I call his name, I want to watch him drop the ball.

“Scott, are you listening to me?” I say loudly.

“Yeah yeah I'm listening to you, you “Son of a bitch.” he responds.

He knows I want to see him drop the ball, but I would probably pick it up for him, and I know he doesn’t think I’m a ‘Son of a bitch’. This is just how we interact. I don’t expect anyone to understand unless you are an old man; or at least a man.

As he growls at me, he glances briefly at me, and I know he’s getting ready to drop the ball. I’m prepared to laugh at him and give him shit about being older than G-d. This is my custom, it’s what we do.

Now you have to understand that from where I’m standing, I can see him. He’s on the loading dock, and I can see the ball as it passes from hand to hand in front of his face. I’m standing on the ground; he’s sitting on the loading dock, less than four feet in front of him.

As he glances at me and calls me a SOB, the ball suddenly stops moving mid-air, then resumes its arc when he finishes speaking.

I’m literally shocked into silence. I review and replay it in my mind again and again. It’s like when a light quickly and unexpectedly flickers and you wonder if you didn’t just blink without realizing it. 

The rational part of my mind notes this extreme irregularity and begins to go down a check-list. Did I have a stroke? I evaluate how I’m feeling, no numbness, no confusion, no muscle discomfort, my face feels the same, my mouth feels the same, no numbness. OK, scratch stroke off the list. 

Now I replay the event in my head. Perhaps my brain froze for a microsecond. I’ve never heard of that happening to people but I know it happens with computers or cellphones, or digital TVs. Sometimes, electronic things just freeze up for a second, and I know that the brain is controlled by electrical impulses, synapses, and shit like that. This chain of thought crumbles because I remember him calling me a son-of-bitch without interruption. I don’t recall a verbal lag when the ball stopped. As I replay the memory I’m sure I saw his lips moving while he cursed me. This means nothing stopped but the ball.

I’m still puzzled but also reassured because I don’t feel as if my physical health has changed for the worse. Next, I have to question my sanity. I feel fine now, and as I look around I don’t see anything weird, gravity-defying, or contrary to the normal operations of time and space. As I understand it, hallucination is seeing something that isn’t there, or maybe hearing voices in your head or something like that, but the ball was there, it is still there, it just seemed to have stopped moving for no reason at all, and then resumed movement in the blink of an eye.

I’m not one to panic or to even seem rattled. Sudden alcoholic rages, domestic violence, and managing 3 younger brothers when I was 7 taught me early and taught me well that the way to maintain order is to fake it. Panic spreads panic, chaos breeds chaos. Just because it’s 50 years later, and I’m not the sole caretaker of a house full of children doesn’t mean these rules have changed.

“Fuck You, Scott,” I say as I walk up the stairs to the loading dock and let myself back into the homeless mission.

“Yeah,” Scott said.

Part of me wondered if the ball stopped again when he spoke, but I didn’t look. I didn’t want to know for sure, at least not yet.

The rest of the night watch went off without a hitch. I started the big coffee pot at 4 am and turned on the computer to get a dose of the daily news while I waited for the ancient 3-gallon coffee pot to percolate.  I had coffee with Freddy the laundry guy at about 440, turned on the lights to wake the masses at 530, nodded to the 6 am - 6 pm as they came on duty, and went to my smaller bunk room that I shared with only Scott and was asleep by 7 am.

As I was dozing off I heard Scott come into the room and go back to bed. We will both be up by noon. We will do something, probably away from the shelter, and pretend we are regular people for a couple of hours. Like chameleons, we blend in as well at the coffee shop in town as we do the desert lot across from the homeless mission. By ‘blending in’ I mean somehow becoming invisible to most people around us. It’s a subconscious art we’ve developed out of necessity. 

Imagine a colorful fall leaf in the gutter, if someone notices it, they see it for only a moment, and even then it doesn’t really register. When did it blow away? No one knows, it was there and then it was gone. The irrelevance of the leaf makes it invisible, it’s the same with Scott and I. We are irrelevant and invisible, and we like it like that.

At about 10:45 we wake up to start our day.

The issue with the ball from the night before is still on my mind. But I know Scott well enough to know that bringing it up directly will be the fastest way not to discuss it. He’s just a dick like that. I overlook it, most people don’t.

As humans, we are social creatures, and as individuals, Scott and I are limitedly social but do it only with great contempt. 

We’ve realized that people will let you down, people will lie to you, they will leave you, they will betray you, and they will use you. Not just some of the people some of the time, but all of the people all of the time. Even so, we still need someone so we tolerate one another begrudgingly, reluctantly, and skeptically. It gets tricky because as human beings we are not meant to be alone, it’s in our DNA to form societies and be social, but that doesn’t mean we like it. Our defensive mechanisms are so ingrained that they are automatic, like pulling your hand away from a hot stove, or closing your eyes when you sneeze.

By 10:50 am we are parked in front of the fast-food joint.  We eat two sausage biscuits for 3 dollars, while the radio plays some classical music. While we scroll our cell phones and smoke cigarettes, I ask….

“Did you take your pills yesterday?”

“No, I haven’t taken them in a couple of days,” Scott admits.

I don’t say anything else on the subject, it would just be a waste of words. I reminded him like I do every day. He heard the reminder and now it’s on him. We know one another well enough that often; more is said without words than is said with them.

“You're getting better tossing that fucking ball around. You look like an idiot when you do it, but at least you aren’t dropping it as often, just to bend over and chase it around, like some kind of a retard.”

Scott looks up from his phone.

“I guess I’m getting a little better,” he admits.

Now, like a fisherman trying to bait the nasty bullhead catfish at the bottom of the murky water, I wait to see if he will take the bait. I know if I wiggle the bait, if I move it suddenly or too much it will be rejected. This old catfish hasn’t lived this long by making sudden choices. The thought of the hook is always in the back of its mind, and the hook is too much interaction, too much interest, too much responsibility, too much opportunity, to be seen, to be noticed, to be let down, or to let others down.

I wait, I smoke, I eat my biscuit, and look at my phone.

“The weird thing is, sometimes it’s like I’m on fire. It’s like I just toss the ball with one hand and no matter what the other hand just catches it. It’s fucking amazing. It’s like my neuropathy has vanished completely, even more than that it’s like my hand works better than it ever has in my whole fucking life.”

Now it’s my turn to think, to consider, to contemplate. Part of me is excited at Scotts' confession. This could be evidence that I’m not losing my mind, but I had already, pretty much convinced myself of that. 

Also, it’s complicated cause… well…. Scott. I know if I respond too excitedly or with too much interest, the conversation will end before it even begins. This old catfish has taken the bait, but he’s not on the hook, he can spit it out as quickly as he sucked it in.
“Kind of weird isn’t it?” I ask him, deliberately not looking at him or acting particularly interested in his reply.

“You have no idea how weird it is. I’ve re-read the article several times and I know you think it’s bullshit, and I guess it could be, but my results are off the fricking charts. Sometimes it’s even like…” 

“Like what, Scott?” I say as I look at him.

I know this is the make-or-break moment. Scott likes to argue. Scott likes to act like he knows everything about everything. It hurts his pride to ask a question. Scotts a Dick. We both are, we are men, and we aren’t limited by the expectations and behavioral requirements of society. If the conversation isn’t like we want it to be we simply end the conversation, and move on. 
All we have is our pride and we hoard it, we are stingy with it. We stash it away and sit on it like a dragon with gold. We will incinerate you with fire before we surrender one single nugget no matter the size. Like a dragon, people don’t see us, or admit it if they do. Like a dragon, we are solitary by nature. Unlike a dragon our treasure isn’t gold jewels or wealth, it’s just our pride, but still dismissed or dead it doesn’t matter what the treasure was.

“Sometimes, it’s like the ball waits for me.”

Now Scott is looking at me and I’m looking at him. The smokes, phones, classical music, and pride are forgotten. Scott is on the hook and I need to decide whether to reel him in or leave him lay.

I’ll reel, I decide.

“I think it does too Scott, I thought I was losing my mind last night but it looked to me like for a moment the ball just stopped, just stopped in the fucking air, until you were ready to catch it. It was the weirdest thing I’ve seen in my whole fucking life.”

“I figured that shit was in my head,” Scott replied and then went back to his phone.

One thing I appreciate about Scott, and a trait we share, is that once we have said what needs to be said, the conversation just lulls, and that’s ok.

We don’t play politically correct, we don’t play ‘let's see how many words I can use to make a point’, we don’t play around with reiterating a point or repeating ourselves. We said what we said and now it requires contemplation. So contemplating is what we did.

I assume he was contemplating this unusual occurrence because that’s what I was doing. It is possible though, that Scott just found the conversation unremarkable, and stopped remarking. With Scott, you just never know for sure.
We ate our sausage muffins, drank our instant coffee, and smoked our cigarettes. The Vitamin String Quartet streamed from his phone into the speakers of the car, and my thoughts whirled like a tumbleweed rushing unencumbered across the desert plain.

I do my best thinking on the back burner. If I think of something head-on, rarely do I come up with anything productive, anything wise, or anything that’s much use to anyone, myself included. 

Imagine my brain as an old electric stove, one of those with the numbers next to the dial. Although the numbers suggest the heat is regulated with a gradient scale, reality shows that it’s not. Warm weather exists but it’s barely warm enough to bring a pot of water to a simmer. Medium is hot enough to boil oil easily, and hot creates a heat that will char a pan,  singe the hair from your arm, and burn your house down with ease. The burner glows with the white-hot heat of the sun and will melt any unfortunate utensil that you accidentally left lying beside the burner.

This burner is in the front. It’s for stirring or stir-frying, for adding ingredients, or for browning meat. It’s an action burner. It’s for things that need immediate attention. It’s for turning sugar into caramel, burning bacon, or turning animal fat into blinding, horrible, eye-watering, call the fire department, put a wet towel over your mouth and nose, and belly crawl to safety, kind of burner.

The point is that’s not the burner I try to use for anything.

I try to use the back burner, the medium-sized one, the one that will boil something slowly given enough time. It still glows red, but not, hell-fire molten lava, incinerating a village from a quarter mile away red.

As I watched the world go by I smoked cigarettes, and thought of other things while the whole Scott pot, simmered like a witches' cauldron with new smells, exotic spices, and unlimited possibilities. Did the pot contain puppy dog tails, 3 drops of maiden blood, wild mushrooms, swamp water, and dirt from a graveyard? Maybe it did and maybe it didn’t.

These thoughts came from the back burner while I watched people pass in front of the car walking their dogs. 

Some walked one dog, and some walked three or four dogs. Some of the dogs were dressed in a t-shirt, by their owners and some weren’t. Some had heavy leather collars and harnesses that were expensive, some wore cheap nylon collars that cost much much less. Some were purebred dogs, they were polished and groomed with perfect nails and shiny coats, the rest were mixed breed, some long hair, some short-haired, and in every imaginable shape and size. Some pit-bull mixes, some lab-mixes, lots of poodles, jack russells, and every mix imaginable.

They all have one common trait. They all held their tails high, they walked as if at a dog show instead of a dusty sidewalk in a desert town. You could tell they were proud, proud to be on display, and proud of their people. I could feel their unquestionable love and loyalty to their owners.

I could tell that they didn’t care if they were walking with leather and rhinestone leashes and collars or a piece of bailing twine tied loosely at their throats. They didn’t care if they were eating 60-dollar specialty food and sharing steak with their owners, or eating 15-dollar-a-bag cheap dog food and licking refried beans from a can.

They were just happy, tails high, ears pointed forward, sparkle in their eyes, happy. Taking in the smells, enjoying the wind and grit, taking turns lifting their legs against the light poles, and smelling the scents the dogs in front of them had left behind.

 I could feel the joy coming off of them, and for a moment I loved dogs, more than people even, I didn’t just love them but I envied them. Simplicity, happiness, loyalty, companionship, and love. Who wouldn’t want to be a dog? I asked myself.

I know some dogs aren’t so lucky, some dogs bite, some dogs are dangerous, some dogs are abused, some dogs are trained to hurt people and attack people, and some dogs are turned into weapons and literal death machines. But not all of them. Not even most of them. I had just seen 10-15 in a row that looked like the happiest pups in the world. I can’t remember the last time I’ve ever seen even 2 people in the world living their best lives.

“If the ball stops, we both suspect that it did. Then it would follow that you somehow stopped it.”
