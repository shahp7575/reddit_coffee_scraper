1hafy95,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hafy95/aitah_for_reporting_my_drunk_coworker/,AITAH For reporting my drunk coworker?,"I started a new work from home job for a pharmacy run by an insurance company a few weeks ago and I am currently finishing up the training along with another 30 something other virtual coworkers, after about a week or so of the training we made a WhatsApp group to stay in touch, complain, the usual informal work stuff. 

One guy stood out as a bit of a red flag I‚Äôm not really sure what it was about him but on his first day she sounded a little rough, possibly hungover. He turned out to be pretty funny but very immature for his age (mid to late 20‚Äôs) and ALWAYS talked about going out to the pub after work (we‚Äôre all based in Ireland so it doesn‚Äôt do much for the stereotypes).

Anyway the company offers work from home or the option to work in the office if you live in the area so he has been doing his training in the office. A few times he mentioned in our WhatsApp group chat about getting ‚Äústarted early‚Äù in relation to going to the pub and I took that as a joke as he had become known as the fella who lives a pint. Then he started saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already had two drinks today‚Äù and when people would question how that was possible as we could see him on camera in teams he IN THE OFFICE he would reply like ‚Äúwhat do you think the coffee cup is for‚Äù, keep in mind there are at least 20 people in our WhatsApp group. I started to feel a bit uneasy about this as he has a young daughter but judging what he has told us about his personal life I get the feeling he‚Äôs not at all that present in her life.

Now comes the issue, before last weekend we were all doing calls training role plays and he was picked first, it was near the end of the day so we were all a bit tired and he sounded very strange, he kept giggling like a schoolboy and forgetting everything about the job, he made a bit of a fool of himself and when he was finished he typed into the groupchat that of course he was picked first after having 7 pints of beer, we all thought that was pretty extreme and I asked him how that was possible as I‚Äôve seen him there all day on camera and he basically told me he ran to the pub next door on the multiple breaks we‚Äôve had during the day and chugged the pints as fast as he could. I was shocked firstly because he was supposed to be in work but also because he so boldly and unapologetically bragged about it in a group with his coworkers. I told him to be careful as someone will see him as the pub is directly beside the office. 

Over the weekend I thought more and more about the situation and it made me pretty upset, he‚Äôs a really nice guy and I‚Äôve enjoyed joking around with him and had even considered meeting up with him and a few more colleagues to get to know each other better but the abuse of alcohol disturbed me due to a lot of alcohol abuse that I‚Äôve seen in my family, including my own mother passing away from cancer which would not have been helped by her drinking habits. I also felt like a hypocrite as I had to work during me and my girlfriends one year anniversary and because I‚Äôm on American time for work, had to work late that day, in the last hour of the shift there wasn‚Äôt much happening and my girlfriend and I decided to share a glass or two of wine to celebrate which probably wasn‚Äôt the best from the point of view of work but felt harmless at the time.

Today I called my team leader and told him about my coworker drinking during work hours and how it made me uncomfortable, especially the bragging and how he sounded drunk during training, I provided screenshots but did not include anyone else‚Äôs responses only the messages of the guy who said he was drinking, it included the name of the pub and even the amount of drinks he‚Äôd had. He has since been in meetings with higher management and in the last hour the coworker in question has left the groupchat and has had his camera off on teams.

I have a strong sense of guilt as I know this will probably cost him his job if proven true but I know he has been incredibly foolish and thinks nothing will happen to him because a lot of his family work in the same company, was it any of my business? AITAH????",0,1733767373.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

Hello Charlotte if youre reading this I am a huge fan and youre the reason i decided to start making reddit posts about all my absolutely crazy and and some slightly normal life experiences/stories. Hope you enjoy the comedy dramma that is my life story lol. 


Hello jurry of reddit, I'm 24f and have been wondering if im wrong for going low contact with my half siblings on my dads side. I never told them i was doing it, i just sorta eased into it and over time they stopped messeging me unless it was for big life updates and such.

Okay some back story, from the moment i can remember i have always lived with and was raised by my grandparents. I was told as a child the truth and how my bio dad and my mother fought constantly and it was BAD. My mother has a mental illness that wasn't being treated properly and my father... Well lets just say he wasnt an upstanding citizen. When i was taken from them i was a baby and was found on the floor with glass and other things smashed everywhere while my parents fought. After that my mom got help and my dad had the option of staying in my life either visiting me or getting a job and proving he could take care of me. He chose neither and gave up all his rights and never once reached out for 16 years.

When i turned 16 i asked my grandmother if i would be able to meet him, i wanted to see if maybe he had changed and maybe could be apart of my life. My grandma helped me get in contact and we set up a time to meet at a local coffee shop after dinner. When we got there i couldnt believe what i saw.

The whole place was empty except for one big table with 3 kids a mother and a man who i assumed was my dad. Everyone greeted eachother and my dad hugged me, it felt weird. He introduced the woman and the kids and this is where i started feeling anger. The kids were a FEW of my half siblings that could make it that day, and the woman was his ex that he met after my mom... she had the exact same name as my mother. 

I got through the meet up and the kids seemed excited to have a much older big sister. I didnt hate them but i couldnt shake how mad i was that they adored him because i knew what he did and how he chose them to be worthy of putting in effort. My grandma saw i was getting silently frustrated and made an excuse so we could leave.

After that i didnt see my dad for a couple more years. The next time i saw him i was 19 and living with a guy i was dating (I'll call him Tyler). Tyler encouraged me to see my dad again and to mend things because to him my mom was the bad guy all because she was mentally ill. I gave in and contacted my dad and we made plans to visit him at his place.

When Tyler and I showed up to the run down townhome I plastered a big fake smile on my face. My dad opened the door and my eyes almost popped out of my head at what i saw. Kids everywhere. The three i met last time had grown up a bit but then there was 2 other kids running around. The place was also a complete mess, like i know its almost impossible to keep a clean and tidy home all the time with kids as i now have my own beautiful little girl, but this place was a disgusting to me. I looked to the living room and saw a woman that I didn't recognize, (sorry if i sound rude here but im telling the plain truth) she was one of the grossest looking people ive ever met. She looked unwashed and maybe looked to be about 300 pounds or probably a lot more honestly. She stayed on the couch and was trying to force one boy to eat a sandwich that made prison food look good.

After i was introduced to all the new kids my dad introduced me to the woman, his latest ex that let him live with her (i wont say the reason just know its gross) and guess what? Same freaking name as my mother! At this point im freaked out and already want to leave.

I tried to stick it out because i thought these kids might need me in the future, good lord knows those two are exactly model parent figures. But then my dad came outside with me for a smoke and what he said almost made me snap. He tried what i assumed was his best to be tactful, but in a round about way he tried to get me to ""think"" about helping out with money issues. He liked Tyler because Tyler made good money at his job and my dad thought that i would want to use some of that money to help him out.

Needless to say at that point i gave up even trying to fake it for the kids. Most of them were too young to understand but the oldest one (Ill call him Gabe) needed to at least stop idolizing our father and protect his younger siblings. When Tyler and I left i messeged Gabe and i was very gentle in explaining how i didnt approve of our dad and that i do not see him the same and that one day i hope he understands why i wouldnt be visiting anymore.

Gabe disagreed with me and for years stuck with his dad and would even have posts on fb about having a good dad. I ignored it all and when Gabe got older he would reach out to me about our dad or visiting i would explain to him a bit more straightforward how our ""dad"" was a bad person and the older he got the more i would explain. Gabe still stuck by him. And i decided i couldnt keep it up, if they wanted him as a dad then unfortunately i wouldnt be able to really be a big sister to them.


Okay thats the whole backstory, now this is where idk if im in the wrong for still keeping low contact. I feel like im the bad guy a bit but idk for sure.

About a month ago Gabe reached out to me, he sent me a big messege about how he was done with his dad and told me every he said to him. Apparently Gabe told him off, basically calling him a sorry excuse for a father and said lots of other things that were clearly meant to just rub salt in the wound. After i read it all i thought i would feel happy for him and the other kids but all i felt was disappointment for some reason. 

I spent so much effort trying gently help them years ago but they just treated it like i was the kid dad didnt want (they werent mean they were just young and thought he loved them) and would always say that he was trying his best to love them. 

After everything i just didnt feel like they were family to me. Biological yes they are and i do have an oldschool thing about family, but its for family i deem worthy and let me just say the bar is low. 

Part of my feel bad, but I responded to Gabe essentially saying im happy for him but he didnt need to make a big show of it and badically tell his dad hes worthless. If someone said all the thing Gabe said to dad, to me, i would have thought id be better off dead in a ditch. I aint defending my bio dad, to me hes nothing, but i just told dad i wouldnt be involved in his life at all anymore and left it at that.

So now idk if what i did and what im doing is the right thing. I dont reach out and i rarely respond to Gabe or the other kid's messeges on the rare occasions they do messenge me. I dont even know if i can call them family really after the way everything played out. Its not their fault, but I chose to keep doing little to no contact.

1hafput,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hafput/aitah_for_ending_a_friendship_via_text/,AITAH for ending a friendship via text?? ," I (25F) and she is (25F). 

OK, here‚Äôs a bit of a backstory because I have been thinking about ending this friendship for at least the last three months. I‚Äôve just noticed so so many red flags that I was ignoring that I no longer could ignore. I also started feeling like a bad friend because I was realizing I didn‚Äôt really like the person she was but I just kept trying. I am trying to get my shit together and all aspects of my life. And I basically feel because isn‚Äôt where she wants to be in life, she is just an anchor in mine. She‚Äôs so comfortable being stagnant that she‚Äôs a hater to people around her who are trying to do better. She cares more about social media. And then her actual life. And it honestly feels like being her friend feeling more like a chore. I‚Äôve even brought this to her attention. We have had numerous conversations about some of the things that she does in this friendship.

So she is really pretty girl but that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all she has going like there‚Äôs no substance. And I‚Äôve been trying to help her find hobbies go to therapy and get a job you know just get something going for yourself. You cannot rely on being pretty to get you through life when you‚Äôre lazy and financially challenged. Like nobody likes to work, but she really just doesn‚Äôt like to work and she has so many excuses and I can see why she gets fired or people don‚Äôt want to hire her. But that being my friend at the time, I was still trying to help her.

I also feel like this friendship was a lot more one-sided the more I set back in analyzed. Like I was definitely there for her more than she was there for me. We could be talking about situation. I‚Äôm going through or just my day and she would flip everything to make about her or some shit she seen on Instagram. She was more focused or where Ari and  Moneybagg Yo got going on vs getting a job so she wouldn‚Äôt get evicted. Like she was so invested in Instagram and TikTok and thinking that she‚Äôs just gonna take off and be viral, but there is no back up plan. I‚Äôm not saying that those things cannot happen but until you get there? Are you just gotta continue to fuck up your credit? Like I was really just trying to be realistic with her like ‚Äúwell girl until that happens. What‚Äôs your plan now?‚Äù I was trying to be supportive but at the same time I‚Äôm not gonna support stupid. Because if I was being dumb and unrealistic, I want my friends to be honest with me and tell me that.

Some of the things that really started opening my eyes were. You‚Äôd rather take out an Afterpay for an outfit then pay one of your bills. Your car isn‚Äôt repossession, but you gonna go out and post about it. You‚Äôre begging everyone for five dollars so you can put gas in your tank but posting how you‚Äôre out for lunch with that same money. Yeah I just don‚Äôt understand it like the priorities are definitely not there. Yeah I would mention these things like real. When you get some extra money you don‚Äôt take care of the things that are going wrong on your car or you don‚Äôt get caught up on something. And it was always ‚Äúoh I will‚Äù. 

So I definitely stopped loaning money. I didn‚Äôt care if we was on the phone and I was in a Starbucks drive-through getting me some coffee and she was talking about. She needed some money because this is my money I go to work every day for this money if I wanna treat myself, I have it to treat myself. I take care of my responsibility so I do not feel bad. And I also feel like I‚Äôm done letting somebody use me so the answer is always going to be ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. 

It isn‚Äôt it that took place a few days ago really was like the icing on my cake. So I‚Äôm in a relationship. but I‚Äôm also really private about my relationships. I feel like anything me and my partner go through this between me and my partner not me and my partner and my friends and I honestly feel like that has work for me, but she is so mad that I don‚Äôt like to share my relationship business either her. Guess she knows that I‚Äôm private about my relationship. It‚Äôs not a secret. It‚Äôs just not her business or anyone else‚Äôs. Recently, my man bought me something because I just got accepted into school and she made a big deal out of it and was giving me envious vibes. And when I called her out about it. She tried to make it seem like I was throwing shade to her. Like what??? That really irritated me because if this was the other way around, I would be happy for her. 

It is not like I‚Äôm letting my man get away my friendship, but why are you being weird because my man gifted me something? So I did cause me to be kind of a bitch. And say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre acting weird because my man chose to buy ME something. Girl I feel like you‚Äôre jealous because you‚Äôre a boy crazy ‚Äúlesbian.‚Äù‚Äù And then I just stopped talking to her for a few days and she was sending me a whole bunch of apology text but I just wasn‚Äôt hearing it. 

Knowing they try to have a face-to-face conversation or even a phone conversation will get nowhere with her. I decided to send a text.
I said ‚Äú Hey, I've been doing some thinking, and I feel like we're growing in very different directions. I really valued the time we've shared, but I think it's best if we let this friendship go. I wish you all the best.‚Äù  I removed her from all my social media. 

And now apparently, a mutual friend has shared that this girl has been throwing shade about me..

So, here's the deal - I've been with my girlfriend since I was 16, she was 15. Total high school sweethearts, y'know? She's gorgeous, like a solid 10, and always takes great care of me. We've been on some amazing trips together and share so many amazing memories. I really do love her.

But here's the thing, she just doesn't seem into giving head. Like, at all. I get that it's not everyone's favorite thing, but sometimes, especially when we're just chilling and watching TV, I really crave that intimate connection. Feeling her soft lips wrapped around me, looking up at me with those beautiful eyes while she pleasures me. It's just such a turn-on.

So yeah, I messed up. I created a fake account on a dating app because I was bored and curious. After a few weeks, I matched with this really pretty girl. When we met up for coffee the first time, nothing happened. But on our second date, she surprised me big time! She started going down my legs with her tongue, and oh man, it felt incredible. It wasn't even about the actual blowjob itself, but more the thrill of being with someone new, the excitement of the unknown.

We kept meeting up, and things got more heated each time. Eventually, we even had sex twice in a public restroom. Super risky, but also so freaking hot! We used condoms, of course. But then she got a boyfriend, and that was that.

Months went by, and I didn't find anyone else to hook up with. Until one day, I matched with this girl who was a solid 7/10. Turns out, she had the best oral skills I'd ever experienced. She just kept sucking and sucking, even after I'd already came in her mouth. She was like a blowjob queen!

We met up a bunch of times in public restrooms, but then one day, she invited me over to her place when she was home alone. I asked if I needed to get condoms, but she said no. Who am I to refuse a young, fresh, raw pussy? We started fooling around, and she was so responsive, screaming for my cock and coming over and over again. She just loved it, worshipping my dick with her mouth and eyes full of adoration. I couldn't get enough of her.

We had sex at her place like three or four times, and one time I asked if we could try anal since my girlfriend would never go for that. She agreed but told me to be careful. I was, but my dick was just too big for her tight little asshole. She couldn't take it, so we stopped. I did film it though, have the videos saved still.

But like all good things, it came to an end. She eventually told me we couldn't see each other anymore. Now I'm left feeling so empty, craving that forbidden pleasure and adrenaline rush again. I want to find a girl just like her - someone who craves my cock and swallows every load without hesitation.

But at the same time, I don't want to hurt my girlfriend's feelings anymore. We have such a great relationship, and we've made so many incredible memories together. I just don't know what to do. Part of me wants the thrill of cheating again, but another part knows it's wrong and could potentially ruin everything we have.

I've never drank matcha every day, it's always been occasionally. I also enjoy coffee lattes, but I noticed that coffee does give me anxiety sometimes.

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety 9 years ago, also OCD more recently, and I have been taking lamotrigine for that for a while now.

Caffeine does help my intrusive thoughts, so I have it daily - usually some black tea, or oolong tea, or puerh tea. Sometimes I do go to Starbucks and get a grande matcha latte with soy milk, no sweetener.

I've noticed though lately that I think it's causing brain fog and derealization for me. It's like I suddenly feel in a fog, I can't really make any decisions, I feel spaced out. I've had a grande matcha latte yesterday and today I woke up feeling this way, spaced out. Not sure what to do with my day, feeling lost.

Does anyone else get this from matcha? I've read that a Starbucks grande latte is three scoops of matcha. Could that be the issue - that's it's just too much l-theanine? I don't feel this way if I have coffee - not spaced out. And I don't feel this way from brewing teas at home.

So could the issue be the amount of matcha? I remember trying l-theanine supplement a few years ago and it also gave me a derealization episode, so I stopped the supplement. Could this be a reaction to too much l-theanine?",1,1733766571.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

Ooooooh I'm soooooo impressed.

A very large amount of individually expensive ingredients doesn't automatically make a good meal!

These stupid things are only popular because of cooking shows because making a normal burger that actually tastes good is ""boring"" for the purposes of television so they have to make some ridiculous nonsense, and they make them gigantic so they show up better on camera. These stupid things always have such ridiculous portions that there's absolutely no structural integrity, and no human being can actually eat it like a normal sandwich.

A good burger is a reasonable
portion of good-quality fresh ground meat fashioned into a single, thin patty, well seasoned with a variety of spices common to grilled food, served on a basic white sandwich bun with a single slice of generic orange cheese (optional). Mayo, ketchup or mustard in any combination is fine, just enough to moisten the bun, but a really well-cooked burger doesn't need it. Maybe one or two toppings like pickles, onion, tomato or lettuce are also fine. I'm not the food police here, I'm not the kind of person who judges people for drinking their coffee with lots of milk and sugar instead of black or anything. I'm just saying, the basic burger has endured for more than a century because it's the ideal form.

1hafh8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/comments/1hafh8t/my_damage_control_protocol/,My Damage Control Protocol ,"  I asked this question last week and didn‚Äôt get a satisfactory answer, so I decided to do my own research before my cheat day. This is the protocol I came up with. hopefully I'm not the only one. The 4HB approach to cheat days emphasizes simple interventions to manage excess calories, improve insulin sensitivity, and maintain metabolic efficiency. The protocol combines targeted supplements, light exercise, and strategic timing.

Step 1: Supplements for Cheat Days

# Cissus Quadrangularis

* **Why**: Traditionally used for joint health, Cissus may also support fat metabolism.
* **How**: Take **1,000 mg before lunch**, particularly on cheat days.

# Grapefruit Juice

* **Why**: Unsweetened grapefruit juice contains compounds like naringin that improve insulin sensitivity.
* **How**: Drink **4‚Äì8 oz** of unsweetened grapefruit juice 15‚Äì30 minutes before meals.

# Caffeine

**Why**: Caffeine boosts fat oxidation and enhances metabolic rate.

**How**: Consume **100‚Äì200 mg** (a small cup of coffee or green tea) **30‚Äì45 minutes before meals.**

# Step 2: Light Exercise for GLUT-4 activation

Physical activity is crucial for directing calories into muscle cells instead of fat storage. Ferriss recommends two simple but effective techniques:

# Pre- and Post-Meal Exercises

* **Why**: Activates GLUT-4 receptors in muscles, improving glucose uptake.
* **How**:
   * Perform **15‚Äì20 air squats or wall presses**:
      * Within **90 seconds before meals**.
      * Within **90 minutes after meals**.

# Walking

**Why**: Enhances GLUT-4 activation and reduces post-meal blood sugar spikes.

**How**: Walk briskly for **10‚Äì15 minutes** within 30 minutes after eating.

The following techniques were also mentioned, but I figured they were either obvious or not worth the effort. Strategic meal composition involves drinking at least one glass of water before meals to support digestion and reduce calorie absorption. It also advises avoiding the combination of high-fat and high-carb foods in the same meal, as this increases the risk of fat storage‚Äîbetter to choose one macronutrient to focus on. Then there‚Äôs the idea of a protein or fiber preload. And finally, there‚Äôs cold therapy‚Ä¶ sheesh.

   ""Damage Control"" techniques allow you to indulge on cheat days without derailing your progress. By combining supplements, light exercise, and thoughtful meal strategies, you can enjoy your favorite foods while minimizing fat gain. Integrate these practices into your routine, even on non-cheat days, to maintain steady progress toward your health goals. Good Luck!",3,1733766255.0,4hourbodyslowcarb,0,1.0,False

It's my dads car and he usually never drives fast enough to spill a cup of coffee but one of my sister's kids got ahold of it and pitched it over on a salt flat at about 50mph. I wasn't there to see it so I'm not certain of how fast they were actually going, but thats the story.

The roll cage is done, but the six points of connection to the front and rear frame assembly also seem to be bent towards the drivers side.    
I am thinking that these 6 points might be manipulated back into shape with some heat as they aren't really bent past the tabs where it bolts to the cage. The frame doesn't seem to have any twist to it when looking at it from the bottom.   
The real question here is, should I? other than FB marketplace and offerup - which I hate using- Were might I track down some take-offs for suspension, a cage, doors, and maybe some plastics? And what might I expect to spend to bring it back into usable shape?

1hafcw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1hafcw9/research_paper_vs_aiusing_students_who_wins/,Research Paper VS AI-Using Students: Who Wins?,"In today's cage match. The champion: An old-fashioned 10-12 page research paper that requires students to cite and describe their sources in depth as well as apply critical thinking/research evaluation skills learned in class. The challenger: AI-enabled students with all major LLMs at their fingertips. 

Prefight info: By this point in the semester, I know who is using AI regularly and who isn't (I've read several written assignments). Several students have gotten prior negative feedback about fabricating material from their sources, so they've been warned not to BS. 

The outcome: Students who regularly used AI during the semester were soundly defeated by the paper. Here are types of submitted papers they submitted:

1. Tried to use AI, then rephrased to sound more ""human"". Many ridiculously worded sentences which combined jargon terms at random. Citations included information which did not appear in cited sources. Not many students submitted this variation of paper. Grades: Very low.

2. Used their own grammatically incorrect writing interspersed with very technical AI-generated writing. Clear ""two authors"" vibe here. The students' writing wasn't even on the same topics as the writing generated by AI. Failed the paper, but invited students to meet with me to describe their paper and the underlying research, at which point I will be happy to change their grade if they can satisfactorily describe their own paper to me. Haven't heard back from any of these students.

3. No clear use of AI, but a paper that does not follow instructions or demonstrate relevant knowledge. These students did not consume key assigned readings/lectures so they had no idea how to describe or evaluate a study. I guessed that these AI-reliant students would get their comeuppance on the research paper even if they didn't use AI on the paper, and I was right. They learned nothing about the empirical foundations of the field and that's what this paper was all about. 

4. Straight-up AI throughout the paper with little attempt to disguise it. AI detectors suck, and the lack of inter-detector reliability is notable. But the use of AI is easily detectable when people make things up, writing things that don't correspond to the cited source - especially when this happens often. The downside is that this requires some extra time to compare their cited work to their paper. But the misrepresentations of sources are often so egregious that it does not take much extra work. It's like they cite a paper purportedly about the nutritional value of apples, but the cited source is actually about the role of coffee in the motivation of professors to grade papers. It's possible that they just made stuff up rather than using AI. I don't care - either way, fake info in a research paper is bad news.

Silver lining. The minority of students who were not using AI this semester - they did okay on their research papers. These were also the students who consumed a greater portion of relevant learning materials.

Once I post these paper grades, I await the onslaught of complaints. But I was relieved to see that an old-fashioned research paper still seems to thwart AI-abusing students. ",3,1733765963.0,Professors,0,1.0,False

Right now the plan is to fly from Big Island to Maui on Monday, May 6th, leaving us with about 6 days on Big Island.

  
My basic plan is to balance chill time with adventure time. I also don't want to crowd the schedule too much and leave us extra time in case we find interesting things to do on the fly (hike further than we planned, stumble upon an activity or nice place to relax, etc.). We can also extend the Big Island segment in exchange for one day in Maui, and fly out a day later.



Here is the basic itinerary for the Big Island leg of the trip:

**Tuesday, April 30 (Stay on Kona side in Airbnb/Condo)**

* Arrive in Kona, Big Island
* Beach for sunset

**Wednesday, May 1**

* Coffee tour in Kona
* Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park
* Captain Cook Monument Trail
* Explore the coastline

**Thursday, May 2**

* Hawaii Volcanoes National Park

**Friday, May 3 (Stay in nice resort)**

* Pololu Valley Hike
* Hapuna Beach

**Saturday, May 4**

* Chill on the beach/resort
* Night time Manta Ray snorkeling

**Sunday, May 5 (Stay on Hilo side)**

* Mauna Kea Summit Tour

**Monday, May 6**

* Hawai‚Äòi Tropical Botanical Garden
* Akaka Falls State Park
* Depart from Hilo
* Arrive in Kahului, Maui

  
**TLDR:**

* We are in Big Island for 6 days, possibly more - at the expense of less days in Maui
* Looking to balance chill and adventure
* I want to make sure I am not making any glaring mistakes with my itinerary

My partner and I are eloping on New Year's Day. We will have a larger celebration in a year or two, but we want to make this small day special for us. There's going to be a maximum of 8 people including the 2 of us and the officiant. The ceremony will be short and we just want to take a few pictures after. Less than an hour total. Here's the issue: we need a tiny and affordable venue.

We love books and fireplaces especially with rustic/antique vibes. We would love you find a venue with one or both of those. We thought about the library downtown as well as asterisk supper club, but both will be closed new years day. We are open to just about anywhere (a library, book store, restaurant, coffee shop, community space, etc), as long as it's affordable and they're willing to open for us for an hour or so on new years. If it's a place with food we'd love to do a little lunch or dinner there after, but that is in no way necessary. We can host our own little reception in our home after.

I understand Adderall is illegal in Dubai. The job (hotel industry) would start in 6-7 weeks. I will have stopped taking adderall now. I am able to function without it. I will work without it. 

However, after going through reddit posts. It kind of confuses me on how to go about this. As it appears that those coming into work residence are more thoroughly searched?

Even the slightest residue in your body or baggage is considered a felony (understandably). I understand that work residence medical tests do not test for adderall (its HEP, HIV, TB). I am concerned with regards to if I get a random drug test at the airport. Certainly the urine and blood would clear of amphetamine. But the hair would not. 

Usually wouldn't be concerned about this to this extent however, recently there was a Canadian man who was caught carrying prescribed CBD oil. I don't even plan to bring ANY adderall with me. Will deal with either getting concerta/ritalin/etc when I get there. Or just go through worklife with coffee and nicotine. 

**My question is.**.. should I even go through getting a validated, stamped, sealed, and approved prescription for trace amounts adderall that I wont even be bringing? Is this overkill? 

Any guidance is much appreciated. Thank you in advance.",1,1733764809.0,UAE,2,1.0,False

I got the Botox last Wednesday and wanted to share my experience so far. 

Surgery went well. No complications. I was home within a few hours resting. The day after I had a really sore throat and felt pretty exhausted. Out of an abundance of caution I stuck to yogurt, eggs, and soup for my meals. I tried ramen on day 2 and it was a no go. It took a couple of days for the sore throat to go away. I started having what I can only describe as microburps on the third day. I was also extremely gassy and it felt like air was escaping out of my body any way it can lol

On day 3 I also started experiencing slow swallow. I chased my breakfast down with some water only to sort of choke on the water, and burp through coughs. It was really bizarre. On day 4 the same thing happened but some food came up with it and I felt like I would possibly throw up. I didn‚Äôt but I became aware that coffee was a trigger for me and it was extremely difficult to drink a black coffee after breakfast on day 5. 

I am now on day 6. I still have throat gurgles and painful hiccups. I burp on accident with very little control over them when I move into a different position or turn my head quickly. I‚Äôll often have my mouth closed and feel the burp travel up into my mouth and nose which hasn‚Äôt been pleasant but it‚Äôs manageable. I am getting more comfortable with the sensation but think a lot of the gas is still getting trapped in my throat making it difficult to actually burp it out. I‚Äôm not forcing anything. I plan to start drinking carbonation after my post op appointment next Tuesday. I have found drinking really warm water with meals has helped with the slow swallow. Today I managed to have toast with very little slow swallowing however the coffee is contributing to hiccups, a burpy feeling in my throat, and gurgles. 

I am being patient and hoping with more time more substantial burps will come. I have noticed already that I am not getting as bloated with meals and that has been crazy. I didn‚Äôt realize how bloated I used to get. I took a week off from the gym (weightlifting) and I‚Äôm hoping to return maybe this week though my doctor said I should just stick to walking til my post op appointment. I am also back to taking cannabis edibles with 0 issues. 

All this to say, wish me luck! I hope it sticks. This Wednesday is my 28th birthday and I‚Äôm wishing for a big fat burp. I will continue to update the group throughout 2025! ",2,1733764697.0,noburp,1,1.0,False

1haes2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1haes2e/approaching_11_years/,Approaching 11 Years,"Hey Reddit, I apologize for any ramblings or spelling or grammatical errors. I haven‚Äôt slept in over 24h (we will get to why).

First a bit of backstory:

Met my partner when I was 19 and she had just turned 18. Both of us coming off some toxic relationships, found comfort in each other and hit it off. Very quickly I might add.

Two months into this, I slept with a high school sweetheart whom I‚Äôd been chasing for years. I pounced the opportunity as I‚Äôd never dreamed of it happening. This was my one and only instance of straying from a partner. I thought my time had finally come with this girl. But a wave of shame overwhelmed me, and I told my girlfriend a day later. 

She was obviously upset, nothing I could say or do was going to make it any better. But she agreed to move forward if I told the other girl it‚Äôs done. To which I agreed. My relationship was rocky for awhile  but slowly the smugness turned to this feral desire to be physically intimate. Very, very, very often. 

We achieved balance in our trust again, and she was very active at making sure I knew that my‚Ä¶ bits? Were hers to enjoy and not anyone else‚Äôs.

This was at around our four months of dating. And this continued, happily for a long time.

As you do in steamy young relationships, you forgo a lot of common sense. At this point she ended up pregnant with what is our first kiddo. 

Pregnancy was rough, she had medical conditions and I dropped out of my ‚Äúsuper senior‚Äù year of high school to make sure I was home to make sure she was okay. Our sex life continued strong throughout the pregnancy, if anything it got more intense.

After the birth. We sorted out some life plans. Agreed that it financially it made more sense for me to be working and her to stay home. I had a higher than average paying job, and daycare was and still is insane. She had never had a job so she‚Äôd be starting off at such a low pay it wouldn‚Äôt make sense seeing as the cost of childcare would be her whole paycheck.

I was and still am a very attentive father, overly concerned for health and safety. And managed to keep that despite working some long days in a physical job. But this is when the bedroom problems began.

Initially after the waiting period. We tried and she said it hurt immensely, I figured that‚Äôs not too strange right? Yeah you had a c section but everything goes through so much change I wasn‚Äôt surprised. So we put it off for a bit longer. Just need some more time yanno?

But that time really never came. Until years later. That‚Äôs not to say we didn‚Äôt, but it was a very, linear and specific endeavor lacking all sense of passion or enjoyment. To top it off, it was a rare, maybe every two months if I‚Äôm lucky kind of deal. 

This was frustrating, which I communicated in a calm way. But she didn‚Äôt really seem interested in getting to the bottom of it. No extra doctors appointments, claims she mentioned it to the OB and they said it can just happen but isn‚Äôt concerning.

Which initiated the start of my resentment. Which I‚Äôll admit, I wasn‚Äôt always in control of how I articulated that. Particularly when she would just flat out reject me. 

This was the song and dance for a year or so, until one day she said the pain wasn‚Äôt as bad anymore and we started having more intimate moments. Albeit a far cry from what we used to.

This led to baby 2, which unfortunately we lost. This was a tough time on us both.

Once that was cleared up, and she was greenlit. We were back at it again, even less than previous though.

Baby 3 joined us.

More of the slow decline in intimacy

Baby 4 joined us

More decline

And here we are now. Where it‚Äôs maybe once a month if lucky. And I am rejected almost all the time. 

She no longer initiates, and it‚Äôs reverted to a missionary only kind of routine.

I communicated how this makes me feel, how the rejection feels. And she would mention it‚Äôs either the kids burning her out, or she‚Äôs physically tired. (The pain portion disappeared after baby 4 when they removed her ‚Äúbaby factory‚Äù parts as she called them)

We‚Äôve gone through books, communication methods. I‚Äôve recommended therapy and have offered full support in anything she needs. But she hasn‚Äôt taken any of the offers, advice, or recommendations. Leaving me to have unmet needs, and no outlet for them.

She‚Äôs against porn, she‚Äôs not thrilled with self play, and i mentioned an open relationship and got scolded.

This has been my life for quite some time. The occasionally lifeless soulless sex that just barely gets the edge off.  In which we go through the same song and dance of arguing about it, nothing coming of it. Etc.


One notable thing however, is the way she talks about it. She doesn‚Äôt like that I will ‚Äúturn situations into something else‚Äù, as in turning Netflix n cuddle into Netflix and steamy. She shames it, and actually pokes fun at how ‚Äúangsty‚Äù I get about it.


Now for the real bit.

I was laid off in October, my company downsized due to mismanaged funds and being the highest paid on the product team, I got axed. I survived three previous rounds of layoffs to still be cut.

I was devastated, I‚Äôve been scrambling to look for work sending dozens of applications. And still nothing. Unemployment is a joke in our state, and it‚Äôs stressing me out.

One thing I am doing though is finishing my GED, and upskilling myself for product management roles. 

I had bought a book on product management and was going to use the kindle app to read it. I‚Äôd never used the app before so I logged in and it lagged horribly. I figured it was just classic Amazon but it was actually because it was loading 25,000 books that were in my library. 

I was puzzled, I‚Äôve never used kindle so what the heck‚Äôs happening.

I then realized, we have an Amazon family set up, and ebooks are shared between us. This is my wife‚Äôs books. 

‚ÄúOh that makes sense now, she‚Äôs always reading on the ereader I bought her and has always been an avid book worm‚Äù

That was my initial thought, until I actually looked at the contents.

Rows upon rows upon rows of erotica, smut, bdsm novels filing my screen. Many of which, the blurbs and descriptions were solely focused on the topic. Not just some adventure book with the steamy protagonist who bones the girl. 

Genuine erotica, spanning genres far and wide.

I was upset‚Ä¶.. very much. Here I was simply looking to read a book to gain a skill to provide for my family and land a better job. And I‚Äôm greeted with my wife‚Äôs collection of smut. 

I approached her, showed her calmly. Ran down the excuse list with her. 

She will dedicate time to these, but can‚Äôt dedicate time to her husband who‚Äôs very much voiced how much he desires her and whose needs aren‚Äôt met. 

She‚Äôd mock me for turning every opportunity into a ‚Äúshoot my shot‚Äù. But she‚Äôs reading erotica at the coffee table next to our kiddos.

She‚Äôs against me self pleasuring, and pornography is banned in this household. But text based BDSM is okay for her.

She claims she never hid it, claims I never asked. But took that statement back when I told her I have mentioned it, I‚Äôve seen a spicy paragraph or two over her shoulder and she‚Äôs assured me she‚Äôs not into that and it‚Äôs just a small scene. Which I believed and didn‚Äôt question any further.

She said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how this would make you feel‚Äù. Which honestly hurt more‚Ä¶. You didn‚Äôt even think for a second ‚ÄúI wonder what this would look like to the husband I am starving of physical intimacy‚Äù?

Stayed in the living room last night, I get an ick being in the same bed with her at the moment. And I‚Äôm not interested in her touch in any way right now.

Now I have to live with every physical interaction leading to the reminder that it‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs all for show, it‚Äôs not cause she wants me. She‚Äôs genuinely prefer a fantasy book over her partner who‚Äôs busted his ass for his family.

I told her she needs therapy or I am leaving her. She needs to figure herself out. But I‚Äôm honestly not even sure she can come back from it. I get nauseous even thinking about being intimate with her right now. I don‚Äôt know if she can repair that bond and trust. 

I‚Äôm asking for advice from anyone who‚Äôs experienced something similar. Should I be more firm of my requirements? I figure therapy is a good start. Couples therapy. Something. 

I am not asking for your opinion on erotica. It‚Äôs achieving the same intimate stimulation. While neglecting me as her husband. ",2,1733764546.0,DeadBedrooms,1,0.67,False

1haen6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1haen6f/the_portrait_of_an_indian_woman_as_a_young/,THE PORTRAIT OF AN INDIAN WOMAN AS A YOUNG DIVORCEE,"
She sits at the edge of her world, a chipped mug of coffee in her hand. The steam rises, curling like the stale gossip that sticks to her name in family WhatsApp groups. A divorcee. A failure. Another woman who couldn‚Äôt make it work. That‚Äôs what they say.

She wanted to be an IAS officer, once. Big dreams, sharp dreams. But her father was a doctor, her uncle too. Her kid sister? A gynecologist now. So, they shoved her into medicine like they were loading a truck. She was good at it, sure. Good enough to pass. Good enough to put up with the patients waiting outside while she sipped her coffee, slow. Good enough to feel like a fraud.

Then there was him. The writer with no money and big ideas. She met him at 22, fell hard, moved in. He quit his engineering job to chase words and blank pages. He said it was freedom. She called it unpaid labor. The money from her parents barely stretched. She cooked his meals, washed his clothes, swept his floors. She edited his sentences when they were weak, tightened his metaphors when they slumped. She carried the weight of him, and he let her.

When he conned his parents into paying for his journalism degree, nothing changed except that he spent less time with her. He said the coursework was brutal. She said nothing. When he finally landed a job, it paid him crumbs. But crumbs are better than nothing, and for once, she let herself believe this was the start of something.

It wasn‚Äôt.

He became the guy who worked 16-hour days. He became the guy who touched his laptop more than her. He became the guy she visited every two months after she took a government job back in her hometown. It was like visiting a stranger she used to know.

She stayed anyway. She thought she owed him that much. Years of her life poured into building him into someone the world respected. The guy who earned a six-figure salary. The guy who came from nothing but was now everything, except hers.

And then her father ended up in the ICU. She begged him to come. He didn‚Äôt. He had deadlines, he said. That‚Äôs when she knew. She packed up her hope, shoved it in a corner, and signed the damn divorce papers.

The aunties wagged their tongues, called it rebellion. She calls it survival. One life. That‚Äôs all she‚Äôs got.

Now she sits at her desk. Sometimes she cries. Mostly she works. The mornings are still gray, but at least they belong to her.

She rolls her sleeves, not for a man or for a meal, but for something better. Something she can‚Äôt see yet but feels deep in her gut, like the first throb of a new bruise.

When the world looks at her, it sees damage. A broken thing. She looks in the mirror and sees a crack.

1haemw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1haemw0/park_hyatt_new_york_city_review/,Park Hyatt New York City Review,"My wife and I stayed at the Park Hyatt New York for three nights using a combination of points and a Guest of Honor award. The cash rates during our stay were over $2,000 per night, but we redeemed 45,000 points per night instead. Having previously stayed at the Park Hyatt Paris, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, while the Paris property exceeded those expectations, the New York location fell short in several areas.

# The Disappointments

1. **Check-In Experience:** The check-in process lacked warmth and hospitality. Although the official check-in time is 4 p.m., our room wasn‚Äôt ready until then, even though we arrived around 1:30 p.m. Other guests were also waiting in the lobby for their rooms well past the check-in time, which wasn‚Äôt ideal.
2. **Turn-Down Service:** On the first night, we did not receive turn-down service. Despite calling late in the evening to request it, no one showed up. While turn-down service was provided on the second and third nights, it was underwhelming. Apart from hanging robes and placing water bottles in the room, there were no refreshed towels, glasses, or thoughtful touches like chocolates. This is disappointing for a hotel with such high rates.
3. **Room Bedding Issue:** On the first night, our bed lacked a sheet, leaving only a mattress pad and comforter. Initially, we thought this was intentional, but on the second night, we noticed a sheet had been added‚Äîan odd oversight for a luxury property.
4. **Room Service Inconsistencies:** While the room service breakfast was prompt, the execution was inconsistent. For example:
   * Day 1: Ordered a large pot of coffee but received a small one. Bacon was missing despite being confirmed during the order.
   * Day 2: Order was accurate.
   * Day 3: Received a small pot of coffee again after ordering a large one. On a positive note, the hotel did not enforce the Globalist breakfast limits. We ordered additional items like avocado, pastries, and protein sides, and all were comped at checkout.
5. **Doorman Service:** The hotel doesn‚Äôt have a traditional doorman. Instead, staff members linger inside the entrance but don‚Äôt assist with opening the doors, which are heavy and sometimes the automatic opening malfunctions. For a property charging over $2,000 per night, this lack of service feels inadequate.

# The Positives

1. **Room Upgrade:** We were upgraded to a City View room, which was spacious and included heated bathroom floors and Le Labo toiletries.
2. **Location:** The hotel‚Äôs location is excellent, making it convenient for exploring the city.
3. **Food Quality:** While the room service food wasn‚Äôt exceptional, it was good and arrived on time each morning.

# Final Thoughts

While I might consider returning if I had an excess of Hyatt points, I wouldn‚Äôt pay the cash rates for this property. The Thompson Hotel nearby, for example, offers stays for 29,000 points per night, making the Park Hyatt worth the additional points for its elevated experience‚Äîbut only just. At its price point, the lack of attention to detail and subpar service make it hard to justify a repeat stay without significant improvements.",0,1733764194.0,hyatt,4,0.5,False

1haekif,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1haekif/she_called_and_we_came/,"She called, and we came.","By the time the Thargoids set their sights on Sol there had been myths for centuries, rumours for a decade and a credible threat for years. For most Commanders - the independent, licensed members of the Pilot‚Äôs Federation - they were just another one of the many wonders to be encountered in space. An opportunity for adventure to those with the interest, but the galaxy offers many sights to see, many thrills to seek and many fortunes to be made. A number of us went to wonder at their sites, or passed through their territories hoping to have a close encounter to brag about in the concourse bars. Some of us grabbed a few artefacts from their planets, or from their ancient, extinct foe the Guardians, trading for technology to enhance our own vessels. But Commanders are creatures of whim, searchers for novelty, and like tourists we came, we wondered and we left.

Few of us took the threat seriously, even while stations were burning and systems taken from human control it seemed like an issue for the big guns to take care of. Let those in charge of Farragut and Majestic-class Battle Cruisers deal with this one. While Thargoids offered the chance for combat pilots to test their mettle and altruists to aid in rebuilding, for most Commanders they were just stories of historic conspiracies picked up by hyper-transmission while orbiting stars far from humanity‚Äôs cradle, or pictures to gawp at over a hot coffee while hauling goods through the trade routes. The Anti-Xeno Initiative led the independent pilots‚Äô efforts and many a Commander congratulated them on their work, but to a lot of us they seemed like just another club offering structure to those looking to renew their interest in sailing the black, no different to the Fuel Rats, the Distant World Pioneers or the Hutton Orbital Truckers.

Then the Thargoids targeted Sol. Then they threatened Earth. She called, and we came.

The cradle of humanity. The Blue Marble. The Pale Blue Dot. Birthplace for those who never flew within 100ly of her orbit. Home to those who never walked beneath her skies. A spinning wet rock, one among uncounted millions, remarkable only for the ingenious, expansionist and aggressive creatures it released on the galaxy. Creatures now learning of the threat to their world.

It started as a trickle as independent pilots started to congregate in the stations of systems surrounding Sol. Political agents abandoning their intrigues to answer a higher calling. Hotshot fighter pilots bragging of their bounties and combat bonds, hoping their bravado would cover concerns their skills against pirates would not transfer to these greater targets. Traders with mass haulers came pursuing something worth more than profits. There were Commanders making awkward greetings to the first humans they'd seen in months or years, their eyes ringed red from the hundreds of jumps needed to bring them back to the bubble of civilisation, their boots stained with dust from worlds where no human had previously walked or ever would again. Ground-pounding mercenaries lumbered around in heavy protective suits wondering how their advanced personal arms and armour could help in this fight. The obscenely rich brought their private fleet carriers loaded with premium vessels and modules, some releasing shoals of other grateful pilots who had hitched lifts from humanity's farthest flung outposts. There were Commanders who had considered themselves retired, a bulging paunch under their flight suit revealing the years of good living from their great profits, rubbing shoulders with green pilots who had clumsily maneuvered their shiny new Sidewinders into port.

If Sol was humanity's cradle then the nearby systems were its nursery where human ships had learned to run and jump in preparation for the outwards expansion. Now this region was teeming with independent pilots, echoing with the sentiment *what can I do, how can I help?*

Standing calmly amid the developing chaos, the pilots of the Anti-Xeno Initiative. Advising, guiding, coordinating, leading. Forging the stream of potential and energy to be humanity‚Äôs sword and shield. Under their tutelage favourite ships were mothballed in favour of those proven effective against the Thargoid vessels. Favoured loadouts put aside for the weapons developed for just this foe. Beyond human space Thargoid and Guardian sites crawled with SRVs as some Commanders sought materials to give them the edge in ensuing battles. Luxury liners had their high class accommodations ripped out in favour of economical seating for mass evacuation. Prospecting ships, their hulls pitted with micro-debris from hundreds of exploited rocks, became smooth and shiny with military grade armour, abrasive blasters and seismic shells replaced with multicannons.

We can not know the minds of the Thargoids, if indeed they have minds, but surely they could not have expected attacking our home world would provoke a response so large, so vicious, so desperate. It will take time for all her wayward children to return and be made ready, even as the invaders are driven back from Sol‚Äôs neighbours more Commanders come streaming in - *what can I do, how can I help?* - but for as long as humanity walks the stars let friends and foes alike remember that when Cocijo, last of the known Thargoid Titans, came to threaten Earth - she called, and we came.

I'm an avid coffee drinker and i'd usually drink fairly strong espresso based drinks in fasting without issue but i recently started drinking matcha (Literally yesterday) and I prepared my matcha same as i did before but now using a scale. I used 2.5 grams of a very vibe green matcha with barely hot water as recommended by the online store disolved with a handheld frother (my matcha set hasn't arrived yet) and topped up with sparkling water and some ice

After a while i started feeling naseous but i assumed it was another thing, so i kept on drinking my matcha. Now i can't take a sip without wanting to throw up. My current thougths it's that my caffeine tolerance from coffee is going to be the same as matcha, it's something more i should know about matcha? I'm trying to limit my caffeine usage so i thougth matcha could help. Thanks for reading in advance",3,1733763634.0,tea,9,1.0,False

1haecuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1haecuh/aio_my_girlfriend_does_not_want_me_drinking_at_all/,AIO My Girlfriend Does Not Want Me Drinking At All. ,"My girlfriend and I have lived together for almost 2 years. Over that time, she‚Äôs brought over her three younger siblings one by one to live with us, because her parents are very toxic/abusive. I agreed to this although I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be ideal. They were 16, 17, and 18 at the times they each came to live with us. My girlfriend and I are 21 and 24, respectively. 

I graduated college at 20 and have been working for almost 3 years in a stressful office job, making good money. I pay the bills  and it‚Äôs tough sometimes I‚Äôm not going to lie. The siblings weren‚Äôt raised with the best role models and are often rude to me, although I think they do it without thinking. I do not like the city where I live and the only reason why I am still here is my girlfriend. On top of this I have for a long while believed myself to be some sort of neurodivergent, probably ADHD. Stimulants or depressants of any kind immediately have me feeling more stable and so I‚Äôve been medicating with coffee and alcohol for a few years. I know it‚Äôs not the healthiest or safest way to do this but it works fairly well for me. When my girlfriend met me I drank much more, but she got me down to 1-2 days a week pretty easily. My safe place is feeling comfortable in my own home and right now that is difficult, considering I don‚Äôt want to live in this town even. At my age I want to start experiencing other places with my girlfriend and start working up, FOMO is eating me alive. 

Recently my girlfriend has told me she doesn‚Äôt want me drinking at all, and when I asked her why she said it‚Äôs because she feels scared and alone when I do drink, because it feels like a different me. This was a surprise to me because I‚Äôm not sure how I could be scaring her, I‚Äôve never raised a hand against her (she‚Äôs hit me before though) and given her no indication that I would. When I drink I love to listen to music, read, play video games, or watch a movie. I am at my most passive when I drink and always invite her to be with me. As for being alone, SHE is the one who brought almost her whole family to the house, people that I don‚Äôt particularly care for. I feel like I am entitled to my safe place and a little booze to block out some of the negativity that life in general is filled with. She admits that my relationship with alcohol has gotten better, but last Sunday night, after spending the rest of the weekend taking her on dates and spending time with her, I asked if I could get some beers since I was feeling a little overwhelmed and wanted to relax before work in the morning. She said flat out no and that‚Äôs when i started feeling how unfair this was. If I ever bring up how I am not the happiest in this situation she tells me immediately just to leave if I am unhappy. I feel like drinking some nights should be a good middle ground but she does not seem to think so. 

What do you think? Does alcohol really hurt my partner or is she being overly controlling about something that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue? ",2,1733763539.0,AmIOverreacting,18,1.0,False

Nespresso:

	‚Ä¢	Easy to use
	‚Ä¢	Low maintenance
	‚Ä¢	Relatively inexpensive machines

	‚Ä¢	Coffee capsules are pricey

At 40 (41 next month), I‚Äôve done everything possible to maintain my health‚Äîno alcohol, reduced coffee intake, all the recommended vitamins including CoQ10, regular exercise, and keeping a healthy BMI. The retrieval itself went reasonably well, but we were blindsided by my husband‚Äôs semen analysis results.

Despite having a perfectly normal analysis a few months ago, this time his count, motility, and morphology were all significantly below normal. This was a shock, especially since he leads a healthy lifestyle and doesn‚Äôt drink alcohol. After coming home and digging into possible causes, we discovered that meloxicam‚Äîthe NSAID he‚Äôs been taking nightly for back pain over the past couple of months‚Äîcan negatively affect sperm count, motility, and morphology. It suddenly made sense.

While I knew I needed to avoid NSAIDs, I hadn‚Äôt realized they could impact my husband‚Äôs fertility as well. If we‚Äôd been warned, he would have stopped taking the medication long before this. He had done everything else to prepare for the retrieval, so it‚Äôs frustrating to realize we overlooked something that could have been avoided. We have mentioned his medications to our RE  a while back, but we weren't warned about it except that I needed to avoid the NSAIDs, not my husband. 

We decided to proceed with ICSI, hoping it would mitigate the impact of the sperm quality issues, but I can‚Äôt help feeling foolish for this oversight. I just hope it doesn‚Äôt affect our chances too much in the end.",5,1733763194.0,IVF,2,0.86,False

I have one coffee machine getting cups pulled off by a grabber into another coffee machine, then I have a grabber chained to that grabber, going into another coffee machine. Usually it was working fine, then one day only one grabber was working all the sudden.

I picked each grabber up and put them back down, still didn't work. So I picked them up and put them back down in the opposite order and it worked again.

Any idea the game's logic behind how this happens? I am 99% sure I did not touch the grabbers the day before they stopped working. It was easy enough to fix, but I would just like to understand the grabber logic here.

1. I had a dream that I was at this garden place. The reason why I walked in the garden was because the kids had walked out of the classroom with the teacher . As if I was a threat to them. I walked the garden peacefully until I saw a familiar figure watching me towards the name of Santiago. I looked out and saw the giant garden separated into four smaller squares or accompanied by one large square.¬†



1. I had a dream that Chance‚Äôs parents were thugs and gang members I met them at the middle school in Jimmy Carter for some reason I angered them and they chased me up a tree.



1. I had a dream that someone shot up our school. I ran outside of MAS looking for coverage but only found the densely poorly put together string of sewage pipes and water pipes converging with each other. The killer chased me deeper into the mess of pipes. I arrived at my house and ran inside my bedroom to be brought up by an alien sitting in my desk chair. I asked the alien how much smarter he was than me and he said 10,000. I woke up in a sweat desperately running to my school downtown. I asked my chemistry teacher Mr. Ricter about the alien and he explained by asking me a question.



1. I had a dream that a local businessman got arrested and was brought to the ruins of a highschool. Years before the highschool shut down. But it got reopened and turned into a mall. But the mall got turned down and abandoned. From what I get from the dream¬† is they go down there in order to get something. Like something is hidden deep inside.



1. I had a dream that at the Detroit Lakes High School we had to have a race with cockroaches. I was picked and passed out.



1. I had a dream that Shane and I went to a school. It was a fortress in the middle of the plains. We spent time in the pool talking to each other as a prince outside of the school pool inside of the golden wheat field watches his dad blind his girlfriend.



1. I had a dream that a childhood friend of mine played in the snow in our neighborhood. A little neighborhood that curved like a wishbone neatly tucked below the Peak of a lake shore. I played a little longer with her until I got called inside my grandma's house. I go to bed upstairs and just as Nana tucks me in I. But I see a monster looking through the window and scream. The next day I confront the monster with my childhood friend but it turns to cardboard. Papa congratulates us and tells us that this is all just a test.



1. I had a dream that I was with a friend. He showed me a place deep beneath his bunker and introduced me to his mother and sister. He was fiddling with a machine until he broke something. The ground shook beneath us and a giant tornado tore apart the house. I got on my motorcycle getting the hell out of there. After the craziness of it all I soon discovered that the tornados not only destroyed¬† the city but also changed the weather forever. Me or technically Maxwell Boit, my old friend from Detroit lakes went to an orphanage to see if any help was needed. The nanny kindly declined but set us up with one little favor giving us our oath that we would kill whoever did this to their city. Max promised and set off to go to the beach. The broken land was swarming with clouds and dusty water droplets poisoned the remaining swept up clean water reserves. Max does well in the school he is at and excels in the math department so he gets a scholar trip to cancun. But his mother and family stop him from achieving his dreams.

I heard his parents arguing behind my back. He looked sorry for me and even said it to my face.¬†

  


1. I had a dream that I went to the Sandia mountains again to find myself traversed in a savannah like area. I went back home to talk to my parents and we both went to the top of the peaks.

You just have to find the right one.

1. I had a dream that during my spy years I lived at a mansion near the mountains. The greenery didn‚Äôt match up with the pale walls of the building. It looked almost like the forest resented what man has built here. I saw kids going through a parkour course as the old man looked at them. He talked to me a little. I went back towards the city and confronted a woman who barfed all over the floor of her expensive hotel room. It started to snow outside.

I felt like I was floating and free to do anything space would allow me to do in this dreary area.¬†



1. I had a dream that I was in this Olympic sized track and field. I had to move this giant boulder across the moving arena. I somehow was able to make this and move on. From there I met the rest of my competition.



1. I had a dream that this huge swampy area in nana‚Äôs lot. Inside of it was this huge mansion, emblazoned with white pearls on its staircases and pointed wooden roofing sticking out like a soar thumb managing to look like a witches house painted white and rolling with neatly trimmed grass. I met the daughter. Inside of her room is a aquarium. A wife and the aunt are making pea soup in the kitchen. They tell me about her daughters father and the monster he became. I come across a enslaver shackling children and telling them to find something. One of the tree forest kids help me get out of the area and flew me up. I met the leader and he flew me up hundreds of feet from the ground.



1. I had a dream that I lived in the Detroit Lakes countryside and outskirts. Were my grandparents and I would drive up to this post office. This rockstar dude also had delivered our packages and letters. We went back to our house. The town looked different though with giant pillars coming out of it and rock cliffs shaped like sticker thorns. My first destination was at the barbershop. The barber happy to see me congratulated me on something about upcoming prom. I went later to the elementary school. I saw the boy scouts leader.



1. I had a dream I was in painted sky elementary school. The school curled like a one story tall horse shoe. It was cloudy outside and inside of the horse shaped¬† school was the playground. I saw the arts and crafts room and -



1. I had a dream that the events of dreams 47 are now being continued. I opened the arts and crafts room and heard a bus coming. I went outside of the school to see what the hassle¬† was. The bus driver told me to get on and I did. As I sat awkward in a flying school bus it finally landed in a small town. The houses looking like they would collapse at any minute because of their unsturdy foundations in the rocky wrapping around in a birds eye view. I stopped at the school and pressed the elevator as I went spirling downwards. I saw the doors open and show me the atrium area. Large arches supported the ground below us and the middle sections of the underground roof showed us the outside. The windows were at ground level. We must of been at least 60 meters below. I saw a kid drinking coffee and joined him.



1. I had a dream that I went to Duluth with a couple of friends. They asked me how I got here so quickly because I flew when they had to trek through the forests of the north. They scratched it off though and I found out that duluth was not a lake. It was a bay area widened out, suffocated by the two different mountains barreling down to the size of a river then widening out, dipping back into the ocean.¬†

1. I had a dream that I saved chance from a school bus. We landed in the parks water probably downtown chicago. I met these robots but only two that I very distinctly remember Rover. A robot with something metallic and circular in the middle of it. Originally I was going to say that rover was to be a part of mars but he probably is from a different world altogether. This robot guy had a floating drone that had copied whatever personality he had felt or saw. The drone seemed to have a mind of its own and only copied on instinct to what it wanted to do not what its owners wanted. The coding was physically present sent into a holographic displayer. We all saw this young child running away from these large dogs. I wanted to help but Chance and the robots stopped me. The child fell down as the dogs tore the clothing apart. The crowds around the scene looked just as terrified as me but the child instead shapeshifted into a teenaged girl beautiful my mouth fell wide open. Chance saw me and gave me a nudge. She greeted chance and he and her talked as we went to the zoo. Chance had to go to the bathroom so I was left with her. My first impressions were nowhere near excellent as she asked me what I was handling and I told her it was a platypus. She looked at it and screamed like I was killing her. I could tell we both embarrassed each other. And she was not happy with the performance.



1. I had a dream that something was chasing us out of the outskirts of a coastal city. We were in the plains and I took off towards the gleaming city skylines.

1. I had a dream that I moved into Oklahoma City which eventually looked a lot like the Chicago I had dreamed of earlier. I saw Jesus and Alma. One day I had an argument with my mother about being here on the phone and told her I wasn‚Äôt going to move back with her ever again.¬†



1. I had a dream that I was back in Detroit Lakes and inside of Nana‚Äôs house. I went upstairs and found a little door half the size of me go somewhere. As I climbed inside I realized I was inside of the elfs letter storage capital. The place where all the letters in the world where sent to and distributed. I climbed out and headed towards the airport. From there I met tristan and talked to him a little before he handed me a golden ticket and offered to take me to some city.

1. I had a dream that I was on an airplane with several other people. We started going off and into the air where I saw mont Rainier and several other mountains. They were separated by the mainland but only by a hair and a string of cheese shaped land the mountains occupied. It was barely large enough for them and looked as if the mountains were oversized for the land sloping into the water. The airplane I was on malfunctioned and crashed into the cheese mountains. After that with the rest of the remaining survivors instead of working together we all started to fight about something.



1. I had a dream that I was at Nana‚Äôs house for some reason I was living with a stuffed animal dog that could predict the future. But this time he did it wrong and told me that my friends airplane was going to crash and explode in the air. I didn‚Äôt know that airplanes could crash in the air but ok. Anyways the point being he was wrong thank god.



1. I had a dream that I was going on this airplane. This girl kissed me before getting off telling me about sofia. When I got off and landed in Fargo it felt like I was inside a portrait of a painting. The colors the artist splashed on the painting where absolute and masterfully welldone.¬†

But not only that rumors where going on that the husband threatened to kill his wife and that was why he tried to burn the house down. He was then arrested as my mother pinned and locked the front of the entrance door so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape.



1. I had a dream that we lived in front of a landmass that resembled Alaska. It looked like a steampunk version of Anchorage and the locals asked me what I was looking for. I told them I wanted to go to the tops of the maps at the top of the world and they looked at me confused. They only told me that dangerous magic looms there where witches use it to keep out any outsiders.



1. I had a dream that we were riding jaguars in the colorado mountains. Later I was in a downtown shopping place. I went outside to try and warn elijah of the blade that went through his head but by then it was already too late. He died and I went back to the shopping district. Seeing the prices of everything go up made my heart sink knowing deep inside this would drive away any customers in such a desolated part of of the world. I was surprised people still heard of us.

¬†

1. I had a dream that we were in a forest with some kids. One kid died and the others died in the cabin. So I went out and ran as fast as I could away from the crooked forest. I vowed to kill whatever that thing was. But it looked like a cat that could stand on its two legs.

1. I had a dream that this guy was talking about how depending on what city you where at time moved differently. He used the waters of italy as an example. And also the capital of Kenya as well. Afterwards I arrived at this house. With a core memory shaped like a mini carousel where it glowed bright red. Then I tried to destroy but this person wouldn‚Äôt let me so I just left it there. I tried to go to its default memory. It was snowing outside as well. Gavin and this kid also where running away from this other kid that tried to shoot them down. He got one kid and eventually did get Gavin.



1. I had a dream that how a friend and I were making something in nanas garage. Afterwards we arrived at his empty house which for some reason had the shape of a disfigured foxy. Afterwards I tried to warn him not to go running in the facility but he didn‚Äôt listen to me. I also met slenderman to in his house. I found the city broken but mine to live in. Something I‚Äôve never felt. It was almost like it was ok to be broken and in a place that you hate. I tried to \*\*\*\*\*\*\* all over myself. I came to farmington with my parents and with the girls. I picked out the cutest wooden carved out sculpture they were selling.¬†



1. I had a dream that a massive tornado hit Oklahoma City. We were driving in downtown where the time was midnight and it was dark, stormy and wet.

Later or fast forward I am in Colorado Springs I met these boys and I am invited to their house to play. I look out it was covered to the tops on a very steep spikey landscape. It had looked so beautiful and wonderful and very snowy on the tops we played video games up until late at night. We all cuddled up in our beds in the same bed for some reason I had to leave for. Crack came to us and said goodbye. I talked to snape about the power of dreams before departing. I arrived at this sacred underground place where Crack showed me. It was a mysterious dungeon¬† a his parents chased after us we arrived at a deep into the sewage systems into some laboratory of some sorts. Intrigued I looked into it before waking up at 9:10 in the morning.



1. I had a dream that a monster lived in the sewers. I went up into the land to find a youtuber talking about¬† how his minecraft world had changed. He showed me the strange base and pipes that crawled to the tops of the sky. Water was drizzling inside of them as well. I also remember Fit telling me about how the mods had a hard time dealing with hackers on a daily basis. He in response took me to the other side of the hilltop where his base used to be. Much of it was intact and ready to be lived in but I do suspect that he must of been afraid somebody had the chance to raid the dam thing.



1. I had a dream that I was in this house up north inside it was victorian styled furniture. The small house was set in the snowy plains of the northern slopes. Endless snow drifts down the dark rolling clouds in the most loneliest town on earth. I called it barren and all the residents of the town knew each other well. They all talked about stuff as I hosted the party. I‚Äôm pretty sure this connects to some other dream I had about the core memories. Interesting how it all connects like its some sort of spider web.

1. I had a dream that I was in a strange school shaped to be the most fitting castle in the world. It had fancy chandeliers the richest would be jealous of.

1. I had a dream that Tristan was being a dick to me at the bar. So I drove away on my motorcycle. Anahi asked me something at the playground and I got kissed by her.



1. I had a dream that there was a mississippi in the deep south. To the south rich white manions dominated the riverside but to the north poor trailer riled up the junkyard. The junkyard being everything in the vicinity to the northern slopes of the town. Here young teenagers would mess with policemen hoping they wouldn‚Äôt get caught in the act.

1. I had a dream that a tsunami destroyed the resorts of the sea.



1. I had a dream that I was walking with Vincent and Samantha down a street in Albuquerque. At first he started walking in font of me but kept on going faster and faster until we were all practically racing. I could never catch up to Vincent because he was running to fast and ironically was frustrated with himself for not going faster then what his potential would allow him.¬† Afterwards I went to bed at night to only be awaken by a swarm of UFOs. One large UFO in the sky kept on attacking the other UFOs and swallowing them whole. They came to my house and for some weird reason made a celebration for me.



1. I had a dream that I was at this house. I knew we were near Albuquerque because of the mazonono mountain range. Being there and all. Afterwards I looked outside to find a giant dark storm and wanted or felt like something was off about it. I wanted to go explore it as we were in this house and all but just could not. Later in the house nana came to us and told that if we do not use our toothbrushes correctly then bugs would go into our eyes. Next I saw Maxwell and another boy walking the path the lonely road.



1. I had a dream that a young girl was screaming outside of my window at night. I looked out and saw two men pushing her inside of a van. They soon to drove away. Later in my dreams I had these two nice asian people as we ate stuff they gave me their small house to live in. I asked them if they could teach me to speak their language but they said no saying it was dangerous to even talk about it. I eventually got them to agree but only because I knew a little bit of it from a different world. Also a vampire met miguel and they played a game of the sun.



1. I had a dream that It was really hot. Especially in places like sedona. I went inside of the high school, met celeste but realized quickly that her body was mangled like a twisted coke can thrown out. The school went on lockdown and Joel was put as the prime suspect for it. I snuck inside of the school and on the fourth floor found Vincent playing basketball. I wanted to jump off but didn‚Äôt because I was deathly afraid of heights. I met Luke inside the school while spying on the authorities and their meeting at the top floor of the school. He showed me along with a black girl what exactly was in this school. LIminal spaces that would contract on size if felt threatened. I went to the ball pit.



1. I had a dream that I was in a house. I went back and pulled the blankets over my face after realizing that a monster arrived in my house. I tried to pull the monster back but it never worked and the monster saw me dragging me to the small shed in the backyard. I arrived a giant library in a strange school. As I walked around I discovered things about the world and the harsh propaganda it endured from its leaders. Finding a radio I put the batteries in and noticed a talking voice inside of it. It was another person more intelligent about the nature of this world and what it brought along with it. In other words it was the soul of my drive and willpower. (potentially to free whatever shackled these people or beings down in the world in the first place?)¬†



1. I had a dream that Jan showed me the school in the water or in the middle of the ocean. The winds grabbed out like a thousand hands pushing me in different directions as I tried to walk across the schools confusing maze. It was also divided by the japanese and the filipinos.¬†



1. I had a dream that I was at Detroit Lakes community school. I looked around the place as I saw Mr. Castro get arrested. There was people at the movie theator also.¬†



1. I had a dream that I was in this secret looking laboratory where I met this girl. She was nice until I heard her brother telling us to pack our bags and leave the plants inside of the laboratory he worked so hard on. So we did just that. He enrolled his sister in a special private school in exchange for the laboratory and the plants inside of the labatory as well. How weird and strange. Why would they want these plants in the first place? He told me he couldn‚Äôt be there for her all the time and wanted me to look out for her wellbeing so I also enrolled and lied telling the people I got picked by the highest lord in all the lands. I actually forged it. I followed her around the place making sure she wouldn‚Äôt get into crazy trouble. Meawhile in the downtown city the boy sought out the love of his life as he and her kissed under the skylight moon.¬†



1. I had a dream that I was with Chance at this strange hill. We and Anahi talked about looting the nearest place the top of Tlano hill. But as we got there whoever owned the hill kidnapped Anahi and held her for ransom. Leaving no real choice as I hid on top of the shaft going upwards to the top of the floor I saw that this was a bomb factory and wasting no time lit the match sending shock waves all over the place. I do not know if any of us survived but I think I‚Äôm giving it the benefit of the doubt.



1. I had a dream that Cottonwood classical was actually a large mansion that was generously donated by someone rich. So that was me of them. I got in I think. Unless of I don‚Äôt actually know. But I do know the last dream for this entry to conclude Serpunus.



1. I had a dream that a weird cat creature was standing outside of my doorway. I went on the school bus as usual but something was off. I looked outside to realize that here was a true monster. Somebody told me that everyone in this world has two beetles inside of their bodies to accommodate for the lack of something else they did not have. I walked the path into the future. I noticed several things like how the majority of people did not know how to read. I wonder if this had to do with the way the old couple did not want me to read or write in their language. How they thought that the languages would hurt society rather than help them.



Blazor- Yikes when are you going to make my story?



Det Cing- He better! I know you have more than just those dreams!¬†



Sara\* Guys calm down. He‚Äôll get to us I hope at least. Let these guys have their spotlight. It‚Äôs a different world for them.¬†

Blazor: Yeah right. You hardly know how to wash the dishes

Det Cing: Shut it you idoit!

Sara: Guys calm down. Yikes

Det Cing: By the way he‚Äôs missing two other dreams. The one about the guy who creates a piece of technology and kills someone cause they experiment on them and the other where a girl barely escapes a rapist who is on some sort of drug?

Blazor: Give him a break and start acting on your part.

Det Cing: Thinking you know better¬†

Blazor: Cause I do.¬†

Sara: Yeah I‚Äôm practicing as well as I can you should to Det Cing.

1hae47l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hae47l,Crema getting out of hand,"I had a Vertuo POP and just bought a new Vertuo Next thinking my POP was getting old. 

I use the same travel cup every day and one day I left the POP unattended and my Alto capsule overflowed out of nowhere. I was very confused as for over a year I have been using the same cup and it was never an issue. Refer to picture 1 showing a new attempt with an Alto after descaling and cleaning.

Fast forward, I bought the new Vertuo Next machine thinking it would solve the problem. I got the same issue with the new machine and all other capsules too. Picture 2 I‚Äôm using Melozio.

Has there been an update to the software? I strongly believe that I am not crazy, and this is definitely more crema / foam than before because I have been using Vertuo since late 2022 and never had this much. It works out to 1:1 coffee to foam ratio which is strange. 

PS: excuse the magazines below the POP machine, I had a nicer black box which I ruined with the coffee spill incident. I was going to buy the Nespresso drawer but I bought the Vertuo Next instead to mitigate the need to raise it. ",6,1733762936.0,nespresso,2,0.72,False
1hae3ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hae3ux/why_are_starbucks_store_managers_not_required_to/,Why are Starbucks Store Managers not required to wear a hat?,"I've been at this starbucks airport for over a year now and the micromanagement is awful and never ends at the Orlando airport. It's especially worse, when you have a 'teachers pet' who's trying to act like a Store Manager assistant and makes it a habit to micromanagement you on nearly everything (sequencing, making sure to put order names, tell everyone thank you have a good day at handout) 

Yet these people don't hold themselves to the same standard. Their drinks come out half assed and they tell Me how to do it, when my drinks come out good lookin and tasty. They don't say thank you to every customer like a robot and scrutinize us once we miss one. They don't bother to care to understand that I put names on every order systematically, it's the shitty system that prints out no name at times, one hand is used to put their hand on their hip and watch you sequence and finish, when they could easily be helping out setting up more drinks and finishing up refreshers at least.

Customer connections is a joke from their perspective, all they're telling me to do is up-sell customers, while trying to make it sound friendly. The outcome is still the same and I don't care to make more money for the company, especially when I'm just continually told what to do and not rewarded except for a monotone reluctant 'good job'

Assuming the best out of customers and being friendly is in the handbook, yet they treat the customers in a hostile way, both tone and actions. Things move fast, people are naturally silly, no need to go back and forth to see if the customer actually ordered the drink on their receipt and complain to them that the drink is fine when it wasn't made that well, instead of just taking the 30 seconds or less to remake the drink real fast since it's not hard and not a big deal, this is an underlying bad issue that has more to go with it, but condensing. 

I work 2 jobs, I'm just not tolerating bullshit very much when I deal with worse at the nightclub. At the end of the day, I tell them, it's just coffee, so theirs no need to be acting the way they do and trying to tell me how to do my own job, when its easy and I've been working their longer then they've been in that store, high turnover.

I'm not going to give a customer a big stink about unchanging them an extra 50 cents or a dollar, just to add some half and half or whip, it's not a big deal to me, especially when this job tries treating you like a drone. I'm a generous god when it comes to customers and proactively act in my own way because I am not starbucks barista at the end of the day, I'm the People's Barista, so intentionally give free shit away too behind the scenes every day because I'm not gonna go back and forth arguing with them, when they've already made it their decision to keep being mean and get in the habit of telling others what to do, that dont't stop be, I'll just act deceptive and vindictive in the background because I don't like being told what to do continually.

Store managers and little drones keep telling me what to do, and they don't follow the same standards and I tell them, they say that they don't need the hat cause it's not apart of the outfit for SM, yet they're on the floor a lot too and have much longer hair and styles. I have sexy hair and im growing less tolerant of their tomfoolery, and have been acting more rebellious and will hang the paper of termination as a badge of honour at this point. 

When you do more than others, and wake up every day responsible for yourself and trying to make moves to make money over day for $2500 rent at the end of the month, you don't wanna tolerate petty bs from people, especially at a job like this where they want to keep treating you like a drone while being deceptively friendly about it. They don't want to explain more of their reasoning most of the time and just talk more assertively. I don't respect that and act out.

I was not staring. Just a few seconds of realizing I recognized him. I worked at a company and we were trying to get him to make content (edit: he had no idea I worked at some company that approached him and I'm sure he had tons of companies doing the same). And his assistant told us ‚ÄòTim doesn‚Äôt get out of bed for less than 250k‚Äô. Which always struck me as kind of douchey but also hard not to respect in some ways.

Getting older makes it harder and harder to find a partner it seems. I can relate. And it‚Äôs gotta be odd for him being a known personality and just famous enough in certain circles to be recognized. And having strangers coming up to you everywhere and wanting to chat. Losing that anonymity has to be tough. I remember reading his post about starting to conceal carry. I know a lot of people love that security but carrying a hand gun everywhere would stress me out.

I also remember some recent-ish episode where he was talking about having a bad trip and just so desperately craving his ex-gf to be there and comfort him. Can also relate to that. Just so deeply missing someone is such a lonely and miserable feeling.

I have a guy friend who has a trust fund and in his early 40s he opted to finally just bite the bullet and go for the surrogate + egg donor route. And now he‚Äôs got two toddlers in his late 40s. It‚Äôs doable with a lot money to be able to hire help. And Tim could totally go this route too. But it‚Äôs also lonely at times I‚Äôm betting.

Life is brutal. So many people are in really bad relationships. And so many people are single and wishing they could be with someone.

For a guy as intense + successful as him, I can only imagine that his desire to have kids has reached a fever pitch in his mid 40s.

I‚Äôve really appreciated his interviews over the years. While I‚Äôm guessing he was early on sort of a life hacker DN douche bag, he seems like a good guy at his core.",1,1733762787.0,timferriss,0,1.0,False

1hae05g,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hae05g/why_are_starbucks_store_managers_not_required_to/,Why are Starbucks Store Managers not required to wear a hat?,"I've been at this starbucks airport for over a year now and the micromanagement is awful and never ends at the Orlando airport. It's especially worse, when you have a 'teachers pet' who's trying to act like a Store Manager assistant and makes it a habit to micromanagement you on nearly everything (sequencing, making sure to put order names, tell everyone thank you have a good day at handout) 

Yet these people don't hold themselves to the same standard. Their drinks come out half assed and they tell Me how to do it, when my drinks come out good lookin and tasty. They don't say thank you to every customer like a robot and scrutinize us once we miss one. They don't bother to care to understand that I put names on every order systematically, it's the shitty system that prints out no name at times, one hand is used to put their hand on their hip and watch you sequence and finish, when they could easily be helping out setting up more drinks and finishing up refreshers at least.

Customer connections is a joke from their perspective, all they're telling me to do is up-sell customers, while trying to make it sound friendly. The outcome is still the same and I don't care to make more money for the company, especially when I'm just continually told what to do and not rewarded except for a monotone reluctant 'good job'

Assuming the best out of customers and being friendly is in the handbook, yet they treat the customers in a hostile way, both tone and actions. Things move fast, people are naturally silly, no need to go back and forth to see if the customer actually ordered the drink on their receipt and complain to them that the drink is fine when it wasn't made that well, instead of just taking the 30 seconds or less to remake the drink real fast since it's not hard and not a big deal, this is an underlying bad issue that has more to go with it, but condensing. 

I work 2 jobs, I'm just not tolerating bullshit very much when I deal with worse at the nightclub. At the end of the day, I tell them, it's just coffee, so theirs no need to be acting the way they do and trying to tell me how to do my own job, when its easy and I've been working their longer then they've been in that store, high turnover.

I'm not going to give a customer a big stink about unchanging them an extra 50 cents or a dollar, just to add some half and half or whip, it's not a big deal to me, especially when this job tries treating you like a drone. I'm a generous god when it comes to customers and proactively act in my own way because I am not starbucks barista at the end of the day, I'm the People's Barista, so intentionally give free shit away too behind the scenes every day because I'm not gonna go back and forth arguing with them, when they've already made it their decision to keep being mean and get in the habit of telling others what to do, that dont't stop be, I'll just act deceptive and vindictive in the background because I don't like being told what to do continually.

Store managers and little drones keep telling me what to do, and they don't follow the same standards and I tell them, they say that they don't need the hat cause it's not apart of the outfit for SM, yet they're on the floor a lot too and have much longer hair and styles. I have sexy hair and im growing less tolerant of their tomfoolery, and have been acting more rebellious and will hang the paper of termination as a badge of honour at this point. 

When you do more than others, and wake up every day responsible for yourself and trying to make moves to make money over day for $2500 rent at the end of the month, you don't wanna tolerate petty bs from people, especially at a job like this where they want to keep treating you like a drone while being deceptively friendly about it.

","Hi so I am unfortunately writing this for help because I am so uncertain of what to do.

  
I started dating my partner 6 years ago having met her online, she was living the other side of the country so we did almost a year of dating before she told me that she was not happy with the long distance relationship, I KNEW (and still know) that this was the woman for me so I managed to find a job and moved in with her which was a massive step as I have always lived at home with my family who I was incredibly close to.

  
When I moved up and in retrospect I was not ready AT ALL I was a messy man child and I can admit this without any hesitation, I kind of struggled a little if I am honest with the lower pay and complete change in my life and then she gave me the talk that I needed essentially telling me to start doing stuff around the house, stop being messy and contribute a lot more, which I did do because it was really my fault.

  
After 3 months she started feeling ill she would literally come home from a long day at work and go to bed I was barely seeing her and I could feel the relationship fail because we just wasn't spending time together but hand on my heart she was happier with me before getting ill so I put this down to the illness (Maybe I am mistaken) after a month of being ill we found out the absolutely fantastic news that she was pregnant this being a miracle as she tried a long time with an ex partner and multiple failed IVF with him.

  
Needless to say we were over the moon and we really worked together up until our son was born, he truly is the best thing to ever happen to me, the kicker COVID! he was born the 1st day of Covid regulations and he had to basically learn what to do ourselves with out friends family and other children for him, we have had challenges with his development but he is looking like he is turning the corner thank god!!!

  
Now here is the situation at the beginning of the month we went to my family with our son and in fairness I thought we had a great time doing Christmas stuff but on the day we left she had to do a few things, get petrol, pick up some medicine and drop her keys off to her parents who lives 15 minutes away, she was gone for 3 hours (not like I was counting but she said she wanted to leave at 10am) she came back and said they just wouldn't stop talking to her and she couldn't get away, similarly the day we came back when she got the keys and a pizza and she was another 2 hours this time she was moving furniture I thought strange but ok.

  
The next 4 days were just weird she was barely talking to me and when I tried to spend time with her like giving her a hug she just kind of withdrew from me so this is when I asked why do I feel you are pulling away from me and this is when she told me that she wasn't sure what she wanted and she was considering leaving me, the long stays at her mum's was to talk to her about me and the relationship, her reasoning being she feels like she is being a mother too much and that is all she is valued for, that I do not contribute enough financially and my sexual performance and these combined has made her question our relationship she then added that she doesn't think we would have made it through COVID if not for Seth.

  
Now I respect her feeling and agreed that I can fix all of those things despite not fully agreeing with them for some factors 

**Mothering**

So yes she does a lot of the mothering to our Son because she works 2 days compared to me being FT, however Seth no longer has a room because we rescued her Brother who is sleeping there so for the last year he has been in our room, this has caused strain financially and emotionally and dare I say sexually, she does all the shopping and when I ask what she wants from me to pay she says its alright, she has said that not only is she looking after our son she is looking after me and her brother, I am trying to address this because if she feels that way I have failed her and I do not want to let her down

  
**Finance**

I pay for half the bills, Very and car loan however its fair to say that she pays a lot I have tried a numerous amount of times to ask her what she wants and how much it comes to but she won't ever accept it she has this notion in her head that I enjoy holding the 'power' of money over her which is completely untrue, the one thing she brought up again was a situation where she DID ask for money to go get a coffee with her Mum which I asked how much do you want? this wasn't a power play I just wanted to know she had enough to do what she wanted to do if that included a meal, getting her nails done etc, but she never said and then I got busy at work so didn't send her money, we had an argument over this and despite me saying exactly as the above she still wasn't happy, is this my fault potentially yes but genuinely not intentional.



**Sexual**

I will take this on the chin I have tried my best and I would love sex all the time if it was possible however with the bedroom situation and the brother we have not been able to have it as much.

She has said that it is getting boring and that I am done too quickly, so yeah I get her complaints however I make sure she gets something out of it because I want her to obviously, the issue is I just finish far too quickly its not because I just want it over its because I literally can't go any longer, this I will need help for but I have denied it too long because its hard to admit these things.



**Wouldn't of made it through COVID**

for me this is the most frustrating one because we did, I know what she means about would we have done it without Seth and I truly think we would have, and then the phrase of ""if your mother was a man she would be your father but she isnt"" comes to mind and this is really clouding her judgement.

  
Nevertheless the current predicament is that after 4 days she is just talking to me like a candle in the wind I know its still early on but my efforts to do stuff and pay isnt getting any responses and she is annoyed that I am trying to do so much around the house.

  
Sundays are our family day however she went round her Mum's with our boy so I was alone without them. She went out driving one night for 2 hours coming back at midnight because she felt I burdened her too much but I am hurt I am very hurt and am trying my best to give her time and space.

So what do you think I should do, I want to talk to her to understand more and try and reconcile but I am not sure how likely this is and she doesn't really want to talk about it I am trying to let her breath and have her space however my gut keeps telling me I need to ask this or that and I need to fight for her.

Hydrogen water into your hydration strategy can be an enjoyable way to support various aspects of your health. From promoting better athletic performance to enhancing cognitive clarity, the benefits are compelling. So, why not give hydrogen water a try and discover how it can enhance your overall wellness?

How Hydrogen Water Compares to Regular Water
--------------------------------------------

When comparing hydrogen water to regular water, it‚Äôs essential to understand what sets them apart. Regular water, known scientifically as H<sub>2</sub>O, is vital for our survival. It nourishes our bodies, aids in digestion, regulates temperature, and clears waste. On the other hand, hydrogen water is regular water enriched with molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). This infusion of hydrogen is believed to provide a variety of health benefits that are not found in standard water.

One of the main attractions of hydrogen water is its potential antioxidant properties. Antioxidants neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. While regular water hydrates you, it does not provide the antioxidant boost that hydrogen water does. Many people are drawn to hydrogen water in hopes of enhancing their overall well-being through better hydration.

Another interesting aspect of hydrogen water is its potential impact on inflammation. Studies suggest that molecular hydrogen can help reduce inflammation levels in the body. This is particularly appealing to those who suffer from chronic conditions such as arthritis. Regular water certainly helps with hydration, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same anti-inflammatory properties that hydrogen water claims to possess.

**Let‚Äôs break down some specific benefits of hydrogen water compared to regular H<sub>2</sub>O:**

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Enhanced Hydration:** Some users report that hydrogen water feels more hydrating than regular water, possibly due to its smaller molecular size, which may help with quicker absorption at the cellular level.
- **Improved Athletic Performance:** Athletes are increasingly turning to hydrogen water to help reduce oxidative stress and muscle fatigue after intense workouts. Regular water is essential for post-exercise recovery, but hydrogen water may take recovery to another level.
- **Better Skin Health:** The antioxidant effects of hydrogen water may help improve skin hydration and reduce signs of aging. Regular water keeps your skin hydrated but lacks the added benefits of molecular hydrogen.
- **Increased Energy Levels:** Some people report feeling more energetic and alert after drinking hydrogen water. This could be related to its antioxidant properties that may help reduce fatigue. While regular water is crucial for energy, it doesn't provide this extra boost.
- **Supports Metabolism:** Some preliminary studies suggest that hydrogen water could help improve metabolic functions. Regular water aids in digestion but does not have the same influence on metabolic rate as hydrogen water potentially does.

That being said, it's important to note that research is still ongoing. While many users have shared positive experiences, scientific studies are needed to confirm some of these benefits definitively. Regular water, as we all know, is the foundation of a healthy lifestyle, providing essential hydration without any additives.

People often wonder if they should switch to hydrogen water entirely or simply incorporate it into their daily routine. A balanced approach could be beneficial. Staying well-hydrated with regular water should remain your priority, while enjoying hydrogen water occasionally could provide those extra perks. If you're active, or interested in adding antioxidants to your diet, consider hydrogen water as a supplement rather than a complete replacement.

When it comes to taste, both hydrogen water and regular water are generally refreshing, although some people do report a slightly different mouthfeel with hydrogen water. The overall experience can vary based on brand and preparation method, but they are both effectively clear liquids that serve their primary purpose of hydration.

In terms of price, hydrogen water can be more expensive than regular water. The infusions of hydrogen gas into water and the methods used to create it can drive up costs. If you're considering making this switch or addition, it‚Äôs essential to weigh your budget against the potential health benefits.

Ultimately, the choice between hydrogen water and regular water may come down to personal preferences and health goals. If you‚Äôre looking for that extra edge in terms of hydration, energy, or recovery, trying hydrogen water might be worthwhile. However, your body still relies fundamentally on regular water, so maintain a balanced intake of both for optimal health.

Feel free to message me directly (can trade hot springs secrets for British Columbia/Alberta) if you don't want to spill in public. 

2) Where is the best place to stop on the side of the road and see keas fucking everything up? I'm an avid birder and need to see these cheeky parrots living their best lives! 

3) Random local treasures that are off the beaten path? Good sourdough, chocolate, coffee, camping, hikes?

I'm starting in Auckland on Xmas day, driving to Wellington, taking the ferry across, heading to the west coast of the south island, then through Lake Tekapo, over to Oamaru, then to Queenstown before heading home!

Overall this trip should take 2 weeks... for keas I'm looking for a highway number to drive.

But, they deeply get attached to me very soon. All of them admired my intelligence and how I view and talk about things.
The INFJ I recently met has become so attentive to me so fast that i keep questioning if that is even real! Is it Because they feel seen and understood in my presence? The guy works in communication field(corporate), he is also good at communication and networking.  I feel I see a different side of him that he doesn‚Äôt show to others. We like to spend time away from others and he seemed quite introverted to me too. He sucks at math and I'm v good at it.I'm a CS girlie. He is also very caring about my studies. He sorta dropped out and focused on his entrepreneurship. He has his own vision and works for it and I have expressed my faith in him. We know each other just for 2-3 years.(only meeting at events,  and saying hi)
He is going through a rough patch in his life in every circumstances. After the first date,  he said to me that im too precious for anything casual and we both decided to be friends. He litetally shared all of his life traumas..he had a n ugly breakup, his business is suffering financially too. He has a tough time with his mother about his life choices and dropping out. There have also been issues in his family too.
I really don't want to get into his life right now and put him under more pressure. I really dont know where this is going. I've always been attracted to nerds. He was not my type when we first met. But, we felt a soul connection when we started talking. I've never been cared for so deeply and so emotionally intimately. We both shared how emotionally  intimate we feel with each other. We listen to each other's worries without any judgement and with the intention to understand and provide empathy. It feels so natural.  
He keeps coming to meet me and says just listening to me brings him happiness. I'm talkative, typical enfp who cracks silly jokes,loves being silly. And he just likes listening to my daily stories(rants?). He says that's how he takes a break from his life and enters my world. It's like a short escape for him.

He also got me meaningful gifts. He attended events and got me a journal. I mentioned about craving coffee one morning and he ordered it to my door. Gifted me sth important Because i keep losing it and also shared his thought process and i found it so genuine. 

Now that,I've also started putting in efforts,i feel he seems a bit distant. He overthinks a lot and says he doesnt wanna look lyk a bad guy in my eyes. He wont be able to bear that.He just likes looking at my eyes. He says, he doesnt want me to ignore my work because of him. He sometimes open up a lot,and sometimes doesnt say anything. I honestly dont know how i should behave now.Should i take the lead or just let things be because i think me being serious about us makes him scared as he is sorta commitment phobic too.

Also, us being emotionally intimate has made us crave physically closer too.. We shared hugs,kiss cheeks. I stated how im not really into sleeping or making out with guys im not seriously seeing and being physically intimate will bring us more closer, then what?, we both keep overthinking about that and i think this is why he is also keeping distance. He said it becomes tougher for him to be around me and not to touch me.  I think both of our love languages are physical touch and we keep stealing random touch ie handholding. 

I seriously don‚Äôt know how to navigate the whole thing.Should I keep patience with him? Should I act serious? His biggest fear is hurting me and looking bad in my eyes. He fucked up big time and being blamed by everyone close to him.
It doesn‚Äôt look like but he is a very emotional guy. I feel what he feels for me is genuine but i still keep questioning everything. I've shared connection with infjs before but this one feels too special. 
My last romantic encounter was with an intp who was so passive that this infj feels too strong to me.

I do like him. We are so similar and have similar views and morals. He said my chaotic self is his inner world and his outer, sorted, responsible outer world is how my inner world is! We both are impulsive.. Im more tho. I love randomly roaming around the city alone at night..we both talk about our dream lives and It's kinda weird How similarly we fit to each other's lives.

I dont let people in romantically this easily either.
Should i just focus on my life while being with him as friend? 

Does he sound like one of you? I feel he is being honest with me. Can you please help me see things from his perspective?
He has been a provider and a responsible guy in every relationships that he has. His father died early and he is the man of his famil. He has mother and younger sister. He is deeply connected to them. He keeps things to himself. Feels sad for being misunderstood. He doesn‚Äôt clarify when he gets misunderstood.He is scared of hurting me and leading me on. I dunno what we are doing and should i believe in him. (I feel v comfortable with him.i trust him a lot. I dunno why.my gut feelings are usually right) he made me study on video calls with him Because i was procrastinating before exam. Told me to make routines and sleep early as my finals are approaching.  He also avoid being in a v close space with me as i shared my restriction to physical intimacy.

Still, all of this feels very confusing for me.I've moved on from my past relationships and in a fresh mindset to date. I'm also 'all in' or  'nothing ' type of person. It's hard for me to be in situationships without labels. The last one with intp frizzled out Because it was long distance and he also had commitment issues and not in right space to date( he just moved for higher studies when we met)

I'm not really asking for particular advice. Just share your perspective about my situation with me.

I wore all of them except for Followed which if you‚Äôve experienced the scent you will understand why. I work at an elementary school. 

Overall I really enjoyed exploring this brand and will try more in the spring. I tried to focus on more winter-y fragrances this time. The longevity for all of these on my skin ranged from pretty good to really good. 

Follow: I LOVE how this smells on me. Like a dark corner of a wood paneled cafe where someone is smoking a cigar outside. It smells almost chocolate-y on my skin but very coffee-forward. Like a mocha with chile spices. Lasts forever ‚Äî like days on the skin if you don‚Äôt scrub it off. Lasts even longer on fabric. Wore it on a cold day and it felt like it warmed me up. I was scared to spray as much as I normally do so I just did my chest and back of my neck and my coworker said she couldn‚Äôt smell me even up close so I think I‚Äôll be more brave next time I wear it. 

Followed: This I don‚Äôt like. Cloying maple syrup. Also lasts forever and you can smell it from down the hall. Like outside of my apartment and down the hall to the elevator you can smell it. It‚Äôs been weeks since the first spray and I swear I can still smell it on the furniture in rooms I never sprayed it. I‚Äôm honestly scared to wear this on my skin. If I smell it through two closed Ziploc bags in the back of the closet it‚Äôs a nice scent of maple syrup on fresh pancakes. 

Unknown Pleasures: A rich layered gourmand at first which turns into straight up cotton candy within an hour. I don‚Äôt get earl grey or citrus notes at all on skin. My coworker said it smelled like coconuts and reminded her of a vacation scent. Ended up giving me a headache. 

Winter of 99: Warm and spicy. Smells like baking spiced gingerbread. Definitely some cinnamon notes as well with the dry down. My aunt smelled me and said I smelled like potpourri which kinda ruined it for me because it was very true. Still smell it after twelve hours. 

Walk the Sea: I love this. Smells like walking on a rocky beach when it‚Äôs cold out. More of a skin scent on me. Compared to other Kerosene fragrances, this doesn‚Äôt have the sillage and longevity I‚Äôve associated with the brand. Coworker said she smelled a faint floral scent at first. When I told her the name she smelled again and said it reminded her of walking through a beach resort. 

Sweetly Known: So much incense. I can smell vanilla if I put my nose to my wrist but I smell like a walking new age crystal shop. It‚Äôs awful. I regret wearing it. I tried to wipe it off with baby wipes at work and it still stuck around. I could even smell it on me the next day. I wouldn‚Äôt have even ordered it if I knew it smelled like incense, maybe it‚Äôs the cardamom note? But I don‚Äôt mind actual cardamom? No idea. 

Copper Skies: I don‚Äôt like it at first spray but once it settles it‚Äôs nice. I definitely get clove and smoke. Very woody as well. So basically, smoking clove cigarettes in a forest but in a good way. I‚Äôd love to smell this on a guy. 

Promises, Promises: Musky vanilla. Not a synthetic vanilla at all but a genuine vanilla scent. Not super or sickly sweet and I could still smell it on my skin twelve hours later.

She was the one the made the first move at the coffee shop and came up to me to talk. We had a brief but entertaining conversation so we exchanged numbers and told her that I would like to see her again. We texted almost everyday between when we met and our first date. A week later we go on a date which went great, we pretty much spent the whole afternoon together. She told me that she was interested in getting to know me better and that she would like to go on a second date, which i agreed. The week after our first date we barely talked which was fine cause I was busy and so was she. I messaged her later in the week to set up our second date, that day she left me on read pretty much all day and when she did replied she completely ignored the text I had sent her and only apologized for not getting back to me and told me that work was really busy and that she was stressed about a business trip that she had coming up. I told her it was fine and wished her an easier week, i didn‚Äôt bring up the second date again.

She was traveling for work for the next two weeks so the day she left I wished her a good trip and we had brief convo thru text, which i think went well. She was very responsive and seem to take it well that I texted her. I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to reach out during her trip cause i knew she would be busy etc but i was expecting her to reach out after she got back. At this point she had never initiated a convo once, it was always me who was texting first. Anyways, at this point its been a week since she got back from her trip and still no text so I chalked up as that we lost momentum during those 3 weeks of not talking and she moved on. But she actually messaged me this morning (its been two weeks now since she got back) telling me to have a good week and that we should see each other soon. 

Im conflicted cause my friends are telling me she pretty much ghosted me for a month and now she‚Äôs trying to rekindle the connection. And while I agree, i do remember her telling me that these next two months are always really busy and she doesn‚Äôt really have much time to do anything else besides work. Ive been thinking about giving it another shot cause she was a really nice girl but then again she did mentioned that she was an avoidant so maybe she was playing me all long?

1hadm11,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1hadm11/its_all_my_fault/,It's all my fault,"I‚Äôve never posted on Reddit before, and I never thought I would. But right now, I just need to share this with someone outside of my life.

It all began during my senior year of high school. I was preparing to go to college for Music (I play jazz piano) and thought joining a choir would be valuable experience. So I auditioned for the extracurricular advanced choir and was accepted. That‚Äôs where I met her.

From the first rehearsal in September, we clicked. It was like we had known each other forever. She was perfect: beautiful, funny, charming, and blessed with an amazing voice (especially for jazz). Over the months leading up to the winter concert, we grew closer. But there was one catch‚Äîshe had a boyfriend of three years.

I tried to distance myself, knowing how wrong it would be to fall for her. But we kept gravitating toward each other. In the spring, when jazz band season kicked in, we were thrown together even more. She was the vocalist for one of our competition charts, and we also shared two classes. We spent nearly every day together, and she began confiding in me about her relationship. She described it as toxic with less love and more attachment.

As her relationship fell apart, we grew even closer. At the time of the spring musical, her boyfriend hadn't even showed up for her, and that was the final straw. She broke up with him.

The week after, she sought comfort in me, but I felt conflicted. My feelings for her were overwhelming, and I knew it was too soon for her to move on. Yet, during a late night car ride, after a jazz competition, she broke down and kissed me. It felt like the world stopped, like all I had hoped for had finally come true. But I knew deep down that the timing was wrong.

Despite my reservations, we fell into an intense, rushed relationship. We‚Äôd spend hours by the lake, sharing moments that felt straight out of a movie, and loved each other greatly. But cracks began to show. Our lives, beliefs, and upbringings were vastly different. I was raised as a conservative Christian, while she grew up in a liberal, non-religious home, and while my faith told me to be ‚Äúequally yoked‚Äù in relationships, but I ignored that.

I hid our relationship from my parents, knowing they wouldn‚Äôt approve. Instead of leading her in faith, I made compromises I shouldn‚Äôt have. While our relationship deepened in love, but it was also rooted in lust and secrecy. Still, we shared beautiful moments coffee dates, hikes, singing together, watching movies/shows and simply talking about our days.

When college started, the distance was tough. I was an hour away at a private Christian school, and she stayed home for state college. Still, our love managed to stay strong and close through visits and long phone calls. Then, in March, everything changed. She gave her life to Christ.

That moment was one of the happiest of my life. Her thirst for God grew, and we dreamed of building a future together on a foundation of faith. We talked about marriage, traveling, raising kids, and all the little things that make life beautiful.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the guilt of how we started. I knew if we were to have a truly godly relationship, we‚Äôd need to start over. Yet, I was too scared to take that step, I thought by doing so I would lose her.

By sophomore year, the weight of my lies became unbearable. I finally told my parents about her, and as expected, they were upset. They urged me to end things and rebuild our relationship the right way. But I hesitated, too afraid of losing her. Instead, I pulled away without explanation, avoiding her under the deceit of being ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù

She was left feeling abandoned, especially as her family opposed her newfound faith. The love I was supposed to show her became a source of pain. Two months later, she asked for a break. I thought it was temporary, and that we‚Äôd use the time to grow and come back stronger. But I was wrong.

A month later, I heard from a friend that he had seen her on a date with someone else. When I reached out for clarity, yet she didn‚Äôt respond. Weeks later, when we finally talked, she admitted she felt betrayed by my lies and neglect. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure she loved me anymore and didn‚Äôt see a future with me.

I broke down. I knew I had failed her in so many ways. I hurt the person I loved most, and in doing so, I pushed her away. I asked her if we can meet, and she said that she'd think about it (this was last night).

Now, I feel empty. I‚Äôve lost my appetite, my drive, and even my passion for music. I know I messed up, and I don‚Äôt blame her for moving on. But I can‚Äôt shake the belief that we‚Äôre meant to be together. I dream of a future where we can rebuild and get it right. Until then, all I can do is wait and pray for both of us. I will never stop fighting for her. I'll do anything.",1,1733761648.0,heartbreak,1,1.0,False

1hadkg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1hadkg0/finally_moving_on_from_a_job_that_caused_me/,Finally moving on from a job that caused me anxiety and debt ,"About a year ago, I quit my job and had a hard time finding a new one. Eventually, I landed a job at a coffee shop where a former coworker was the GM. At first, it seemed promising‚ÄîI was told I‚Äôd get about 40 hours a week, and the pay was better than I expected. Unfortunately, that wasn‚Äôt the reality. Neither the hours nor the pay lived up to what was promised.

This job made me miserable. The pay was awful for the amount of work we had to do, and the environment was toxic. My coworkers made fun of me behind my back, excluded me from their cliques, and were just rude to my face for no reason. Nobody was ever held accountable, and I constantly felt like an outsider. On top of all that, the stress kept me up at night, worrying about my finances and dreading going in every day.

A few months ago, I got a serving job at an upscale restaurant. It‚Äôs been a lifesaver, but I stayed at the coffee shop to pay off some debt I had accumulated while working there. This past Saturday, though, I hit my breaking point. On Sunday, I texted my coffee shop manager to let her know I wouldn‚Äôt be coming in and gave my two weeks‚Äô ‚Äúnotice‚Äù (even though I was going to be gone for the next two weeks anyway).

When I told my serving job manager that I‚Äôd be going full-time, she was so supportive and happy for me! Honestly, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I haven‚Äôt felt this relieved and happy in such a long time.

I‚Äôm about to graduate college next week, and things are finally looking up. Time to leave the negativity behind and focus on positive things ahead! Cheers to fresh starts and brighter days! ",6,1733761542.0,work,2,0.88,False

Interestingly people even asked if I had drunk something unusual because of its unique smell. The mouthwash has a distinct medicinal scent kind of like the smell you notice when walking into a hospital. It‚Äôs hard to describe but it‚Äôs unmistakably clinical

Like, Red Shoes White Socks clearly tells a story of going south of Missouri which could be referring to a real occurrence as they are based in St. Louis. Cold Chicken and Coffee also seems to refer to something that actually happened, maybe a memory of a diner in Miami where they were served cold chicken and coffee (although he does start talking about ""not doing what you say"" later into the song so I don't exactly know how that would relate to the overarching story)? Let me know if you can think of anything but so far this is what I am trying to figure out:

1: Is there some sort of cohesion? A specific theme?

2: Does it tell a story linearly? Do the order of the songs mean anything?

3: Are there underlying themes behind the songs?

I'm in the process of designing the electrical system for my food truck, and I'm looking for some expert advice on how to solve a power supply problem. Here are the details of the situation:

Equipment to be powered:

* Coffee machine: 8800 W
* Refrigerator: 500 W
* Freezer: 500 W
* Ice maker: 380 W
* Beverage fridge: 250 W
* Coffee grinder : 310 W

Total: 10,740 W

Context:

* The city provides me with power via a 32 A single-phase socket (7360 W max, at 230 V).
* The coffee machine only needs 8800W when the boilers are heating up. In theory, the rest of the time, consumption is well below that.

Possible solution:

I've been considering a solution in which it would be possible to integrate a battery with a grid-synchronized inverter to supplement the missing power during peaks. The idea is to use the 32 A socket as the main power source and add a battery coupled to an inverter to inject additional power during peak consumption periods. I'm looking for a solution so that it's not just a selector that chooses a power source (either battery or grid) but a solution that can supplement the lack of power from my 32A socket alone. And this ‚Äúboost‚Äù idea wouldn't have to be continuous, but just when power was needed (so I'd need a management system that could communicate these needs with the inverter). Also, the best thing would be to be able to recharge the battery with low power throughout the day.

If you have any ideas, it would be a great, great help! Many thanks in advance",1,1733761403.0,ElectricalEngineering,1,1.0,False
1hadi84,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1hadi84/advice_for_anyone_struggling_with_their_homemade/,Advice for anyone struggling with their homemade cold brew,"I have been struggling with having a strange sour/bitter flavor in my homemade cold brew for years. I‚Äôve experimented with many different factors and still experienced this gross, off-putting flavor every time. I was using this french press type device for cold coffee, basically steeping the grounds in with the water and pressing the grounds to the bottom after the desired amount of hours. Every time, without fail, it turned out disgusting. I recently bought beans from a local coffee shop where I‚Äôm a big fan of their cold brew. I had them grind the beans for me on coarse and asked for their recipe. I followed it exactly and the flavor was still off. This is when I got frustrated and knew I needed to try something different. I bought one of those mesh strainers that you put in a mason jar because my boyfriend‚Äôs dad and brother use it and only had good things to say. I had one of my family members try the two cold brews made with different methods this morning and they were shocked at the flavor difference it made. Now this might seem obvious to some of you, but I have seen many people make cold brew by just leaving the grounds in the water and straining it the next day. Having that added filtration definitely helps cut back on some of that bitterness and drastically improved the flavor of the cold brew. If you are struggling with the flavor and have tried many different things, I highly recommend just switching up your method. I am so excited to be able to make cold brew at home that I enjoy now and don‚Äôt just have to dump it out and run to my local coffee shop. ",4,1733761385.0,coldbrew,6,1.0,False

For nearly 2 decades, this shop has been more than a place to grab coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs been a community hub, a supporter of local events, a safe-haven for many baristas and customers, and a proud part of Roswell‚Äôs history.

The building itself is from the 19th century, carrying significant historical value and embodying the charm of downtown Roswell. Yet, it‚Äôs currently under threat.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

* The new food court, Roswell Junction, has started removing parking spaces in the main lot‚Äîspaces that have been shared by the coffeeshop and previous tenants for years.
* They‚Äôre threatening to tow cars that park in these spaces, discouraging our customers from visiting.
* There are rumors that they intend to purchase the coffeeshop, demolish the historic building, and turn it into additional parking for their business.

This isn‚Äôt just about parking. It‚Äôs about protecting a space that has been part of Roswell‚Äôs identity for decades and ensuring it doesn‚Äôt get erased in the name of convenience.

We need your help:

1. Raise awareness: Share this post with friends, family, and anyone who values preserving our community‚Äôs history.
2. Speak out: Contact city officials and local historical societies to express concern over the potential loss of this historic building.
3. Visit and support: Come to Land of a Thousand Hills, enjoy a coffee, and let the owners and staff know you stand with them. Every visit counts!
4. Protest their actions: If the situation escalates, we may organize a peaceful protest to demonstrate just how much this place means to all of us.

Roswell‚Äôs history and community spaces are worth fighting for. Let‚Äôs show that we won‚Äôt let corporate interests erase what makes this city special. Please share this post with anyone else who understands the importance of keeping Historic Roswell and Land of 1000 Hills Coffee alive.

1haderc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1haderc/i_can_only_taste_fruity_notes_with_fermented/,I can only taste ‚Äúfruity‚Äù notes with fermented anaerobic coffees,"I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I read this sub a lot and look at conversations and am totally not getting any of the tasting notes y‚Äôall describe when making pour overs.

The only time I get really clear fruity notes that are distinguishable are in heavily fermented anaerobic roasts. Stuff that is usually off the cuff from your normal rotation most roasters provide.

Outside of that. Literally any coffee I buy from speciality roasters tastes the same. Natural or washed or whatever. If you were to blind me and tell me the difference between two different light roasts I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the difference. It all just tastes like coffee to me. There is nothing I pick up that has any discernible difference. I LOVE blueberry and I have yet to brew a coffee with any hint of blueberry despite me actively seeking it out. 

I mostly use a V60. Just started using a switch. 3rd wave water. And a 1zpresso ZP6. (Prior I had a Feld2). Hoped I‚Äôd get some different flavor profiles but it largely tastes the same.

Granted all the coffee tastes great. But I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on what I could be potentially getting seeing what you all describe. I would say my palate just needs to be refined but I‚Äôve been doing pour overs for 3-4 years and still nothing stands out to me.",1,1733761139.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

I'm in the process of designing the electrical system for my food truck, and I'm looking for some expert advice on how to solve a power supply problem. Here are the details of the situation:

Equipment to be powered:

* Coffee machine: 8800 W
* Refrigerator: 500 W
* Freezer: 500 W
* Ice maker: 380 W
* Beverage fridge: 250 W
* Coffee grinder : 310 W

Total: 10,740 W

Context:

* The city provides me with power via a 32 A single-phase socket (7360 W max, at 230 V).
* The coffee machine only needs 8800W when the boilers are heating up. In theory, the rest of the time, consumption is well below that.

Possible solution:

I've been considering a solution in which it would be possible to integrate a battery with a grid-synchronized inverter to supplement the missing power during peaks. The idea is to use the 32 A socket as the main power source and add a battery coupled to an inverter to inject additional power during peak consumption periods. I'm looking for a solution so that it's not just a selector that chooses a power source (either battery or grid) but a solution that can supplement the lack of power from my 32A socket alone. And this ‚Äúboost‚Äù idea wouldn't have to be continuous, but just when power was needed (so I'd need a management system that could communicate these needs with the inverter). Also, the best thing would be to be able to recharge the battery with low power throughout the day.

If you have any ideas, it would be a great, great help! Many thanks in advance",1,1733761060.0,SolarUK,0,1.0,False
1haddj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1haddj6/if_im_only_avoiding_something_because_im_tired_i/,"If I'm only avoiding something because I'm tired, I do it anyway","I often have low energy, but I've noticed that activities that energize me require an initial push. So I made a rule: if tiredness is the only thing stopping me, I do the thing anyway. This applies to everything from getting up off the couch to pee or heat my coffee to going for a walk or making some art or playing guitar or whatever else.

This doesn't help with deciding what you want to do. But when tiredness is the only barrier between me and an activity I know I want to do, this rule helps overcome that initial resistance.

I know this sounds easier than it is, but there's a growing pattern now where I start to recognize that I'm only stuck bc I'm a little tired and then I have to follow the rule I already made. 

Note: This isn't about ignoring your need for rest. It's about building momentum when you want to be active but feel stuck.",11,1733761052.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False
