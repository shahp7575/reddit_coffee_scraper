So my SO and I recently started living together and he has this very rigid rule that he has to spend an hour a say with each of his kids alternating days (he has 50/50 with them so they are here the first half of the week one week, and then the other half the next week). Which I think is wonderful and I encourage that. (I also have my own child as well so I totally get it). He set a really firm boundary in the beginning of our relationship that this is the time he spend with his kids and he doesn't want any interruptions. Which has been fine. I go find something else to do or I spend time with my daughter. 


However I've noticed there have been some times where I feel like it doesn't entirely make sense for him to still carve out that time. So for example, there have been a few times we have all done things together like gone to the zoo or went to a water park  (literally gone allllll day for these things) and then when we get back he says he is exhausted but he still has to do his time with X or Y kid. Or when the kids have their sport practice and he has been gone immediately from when he gets off work to take them (he stays with them to watch the entire practice or game)  and then he comes home and we have dinner then he says he has to go hang out with them for an hour, so by the time he is done it's time for everyone to go to bed (about 10-10:30pm or so). 


Then tonight just happened where I had texted him asking when he would be done with one of the kids so I can be back from my walk and we can hopefully spend some time together and play video games before bed. He says he would be done shortly after 10, so I get back by 9:50, take a shower, and make a coffee and waited for him and he comes down at 10:20 and says he doesn't feel good and wants to go to bed early. He's been sick with the flu, so it's totally okay he wants to go to bed early but I was waiting on him for almost half an hour thinking we could spend some time together (we haven't had much alone time just the 2 of us this week). With this one, I am disappointed we didnt get to spend any time together like i thought we would, but i understand things happen, but if he really didn't feel good then he should have prioritized his health and gone to bed. There are also times where he is so exhausted by the end of the day when he does spend time with them (usually they just want him to sit with them while they play video games) he just ends up falling asleep and either they have to wake him up or I've had to go get him for bed. 


I know I will get my time with my SO when the kids aren't here or he will make it up to me when he can. That's really not exactly the issue, I just guess I feel like... at what point is it to a detriment to himself? I also just feel like if we all go out together at the zoo or something then that should count somewhat as quality time, right? Or if he is sick and needs to sleep or literally doesn't have the energy then he should prioritize his own needs, right? It just seems like he really doesn't want to disappoint them, I guess, but sometimes there literally isn't enough time in the day and I feel like he should just have to tell them it can wait another day?? 


I'm honestly not sure if I am over reacting about this or not though and I'm worried that if I try to talk to him he's going to think I'm trying to take away time from him and his kids which isn't the issue at all. I can survive an hour, but sometimes it just seems unreasonable. I feel like there should be limits or stipulations? He's just so rigid about it and doesn't even seem willing to cut the time short if needed.

1l3pxih,https://i.redd.it/9vy74w0v915f1.jpeg,"Stop chasing the rug, start building the world's first BRANDCOIN with KENDU","**üöÄ Kendu Inu: Real-World Utility Meets Decentralized Coordination**

Most crypto projects are stuck in the simulation just numbers, hype, and vaporware. Some AI Art, and guys making mysterious promises that never happen, and then they disappear with your money.

  
Kendu Inu is different. It's proving what happens when decentralized communities stop talking and start building. IRL. This is a permissionless brandcoin with community as service, buliding real life businesses and asking you to do the same without stopping to ask ""dev team may i?"" If you dream it? You ""can do"" it!

No venture capital. No central authority. Just aligned incentives and actual output.

# üß† Some examples of current Community-Driven Innovation (Yes, in the Physical World)

1. **Autonomous Retail (Kendu Vending Machines)** Deployed in Nashville. Fully branded, 24/7 smart vending machines. Not a startup. Not a franchise. Just the Kendu community executing. Imagine if 7-Eleven was open-source.
2. **Consumer Goods (Kendu Energy)** Energy drinks. Real product. Real distribution. Featured at public events. Community-formulated, community-marketed. This is memetic branding at physical scale.
3. **Urban Visibility (Kendu Murals)** Mural installations in Miami and other cities. It's not just art. It's decentralized advertising, funded and executed by believers. No marketing budget needed when your community *is* the brand.
4. **Kendu Coffee** Beverage vertical expansion. Not a partnership. A creation. Represents the kind of lateral innovation you get when constraints are removed and incentives are aligned.

# üåç The Kendu Protocol for Real-World Execution

Kendu Inu functions like an open-source IP layer for brand and business creation.  
Anyone can build under the Kendu name: no permission required, only community trust.  
It‚Äôs not a company. It‚Äôs a decentralized economic membrane.

This isn‚Äôt about coins. It‚Äôs about coordination.  
The Kendu community isn‚Äôt speculating. 

They‚Äôre shipping.

**üöÄ Kendu Inu: Decentralized Innovation at Its Finest**

People keep asking what‚Äôs next in Web3. The answer‚Äôs already here. 

Kendu Inu isn‚Äôt just another memecoin. It‚Äôs an emergent protocol for grassroots coordination, brand virality, and bottom-up economic creation. It‚Äôs what Dogecoin was supposed to be but with utility, creativity, and actual human energy behind it. Social media and community metrics support the idea that Kendu builds.

# üåê Reddit: Open-Source Community Dynamics

The Kendu subreddit isn‚Äôt just growing. It‚Äôs evolving.  
5,000+ members isn‚Äôt just a number. That‚Äôs a node map of decentralized content creation, memetic engineering, and iterative community product feedback loops.

In other words: no marketing spend, no influencers just signal building some beautiful noise.

# üß† Twitter (X): Network Effect in Real-Time

Kendu‚Äôs growth on X is a classic case study in how organic communities outperform centralized branding teams.

* 20K+ followers.
* Viral spikes of 600+ followers per day.
* Zero paid media.

That‚Äôs what happens when you build a memetic brand with emergent behavior. It‚Äôs like if Tesla and Shiba Inu had a baby only the baby‚Äôs caffeinated and running a vending machine business in Tennessee.

# üìâ On-Chain Metrics: The Graph Never Lies

Holder count is climbing over 16,500 wallets and accelerating.  
This isn‚Äôt hype; it‚Äôs a signal that Kendu is hitting resonance with early adopters across ecosystems.

>

Kendu is now past the initial virality phase and entering network saturation.

This isn‚Äôt just memecoin culture. It‚Äôs applied DAOs with shipping velocity.

We‚Äôve talked a lot about AI, autonomy, and economic singularities but Kendu shows how human networks still win through creativity, humor, and trust.

# TL;DR

Kendu Inu is what you get when you combine open-source brand logic, self-replicating memetics, and IRL execution.

Will it go to $0? Possibly.  
Will it also 100x because someone just launched a food truck called ‚ÄúKendu Dogs‚Äù? Also possible.

But the real question is:

**Are you building or just watching?**

My parents, accumulatively, make about $200,000 a year. We live in an ordinary middle class neighborhood. So, of course, they could afford for me to go to college. 

They just don‚Äôt want to. they don‚Äôt want to help. they don‚Äôt want to aid in literally any way aside from giving me somewhere to live. However, they love to bring up college and all the things I could do. To be honest, it kind of pisses me off. 

I‚Äôm going to see an academic advisor for community college to go for a couple years and hopefully transfer to university. I‚Äôm currently working between 40 and 50 hours a week in a restaurant, and the money I get gets split between savings for school, savings for my vacation in September, and a little bit leftover for gas (and a couple coffees or something if I can). 

Fortunately, I do get paid every week. That‚Äôs pretty nice. But I had severe social anxiety for years, so this is now my first job. I‚Äôve only been working since March, and I‚Äôm 21. So far I have about $2000 saved for school. 

I think i‚Äôm ok right now, but school is expensive and I have no idea what to do. I‚Äôm still financially dependent on my parents, so I can‚Äôt get any kind of financial aid. It‚Äôs frustrating, because I can‚Äôt get help paying since my parents make too much money, but they don‚Äôt want to help. 

Is there anything else I can do aside from working as much as possible? Also‚Äî I‚Äôm keeping this a secret from everybody. I already have a meeting scheduled with the academic advisor, but because I don‚Äôt want anybody interfering with my education or my plans, I‚Äôm keeping this a secret from them for a while. as long as I feasibly can, really.

We‚Äôve been in complete no contact, but he‚Äôs been on my mind constantly. For the longest time, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that what we had wasn‚Äôt something I could just move on from.

He wasn‚Äôt just another relationship for me, we shared such a genuine love and connection that I truly don‚Äôt think I will ever feel again. He was my person, my best friend, soulmate and the person i wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Being with him made everything feel right in a way I‚Äôd never experienced before. It was deep, emotional, and full of meaning. Even after everything, no one I‚Äôve met since has even come close to that kind of connection.

About a week ago, I reached out. I had been carrying so much weight, had been thinking about him constantly, and I just needed to know if there was anything still there. He was kind and receptive and said he needed some time to think, and he‚Äôd like to reconnect and meet for coffee in a couple of weeks to talk.

I spent so long aching over this person, over what we lost, and now that I‚Äôm close to maybe getting some answers, I don‚Äôt even know what I feel anymore.

Has anyone else been through something like this? Where you were holding onto something so tightly for so long, and then when the moment finally comes, it feels like it‚Äôs gone? I don‚Äôt know what this shift means or what to do with it.

1l3pvr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/geometrydash/comments/1l3pvr5/the_current_difficulty_of_the_demonlist/,The current difficulty of the demonlist,"for some time now ive found many people struggle to conceptualize how difficult this game is, especially if you haven‚Äôt played it to experience the difficulty yourself



I decided to compare the difficulty of known difficult levels using the only semi reliable metric out there: attempts.



Taking a median from my own and several other youtuber‚Äôs play sessions, I estimate a good focused player can output between 300-2000 attempts per hour, depending on the difficulty density of the level, the respawn time of the game, the game speed, and the focus of the player, among other factors.



To estimate the amount of attempts a novice player should take to beat the given levels, I averaged out the attempts taken as different players improved across their careers using [pointercrate.com](http://pointercrate.com) data. taking into account the hardest level that player had beaten at that time (their hardest demon), I basically added up all of their attempts up until their hardest level.



So basically these gd levels are estimated to take a novice player at least the same amount of hours playing the game to complete for the first time as these skills. Take it with a grain of salt, I'm nowhere near the skill to speak about some of the hardest stuff in here, i just thought this would be fun to try to compare.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/s/VOhGMyuFWD)  **May 15, 2023**

My apologies for how long this is about to be.

My nesting partner (29M) and I (34NB) have been together for almost 8 years, polyamorous for 3. I'll call my NP Dennis for the purposes of this story. Our journey was a little wonky as we started off as newbie, inexperienced poly folks, and our relationship became functionally monogamous as busy adulthood ran us over. Eventually, we did some reading/work together, and jankily waded our way into polyamory in earnest.

For the most part our progress has been steady. We've worked on communicating as much as we can, respecting each others' boundaries, and working on our respective issues with jealousy. I have two other partners and he has one (whom I met for dinner recently and got on like a house on fire!). We've talked about polyamory being a great fit for us and how it enables us to explore relationships with people we care about - we have both known all of our respective partners for over a decade.

The one recurring theme is that Dennis gets huge amounts of NRE when he meets someone new and there's mutual attraction. Unfortunately, most of the time these people end up either not open to ENM, or are brand new to it. I've supported him through many bouts of grieving when he realises a relationship can't possibly happen, or crashes and burns because the other person realises ENM isn't for them.

I've also encouraged him to be proactive with finding people who are already experienced in ENM to avoid heartache down the line. Especially after his first relationship, with a childhood friend who ended up wanting to cowgirl him, exploded spectacularly and put us all through a huge amount of pain.

Overall, however, I had thought Dennis and I had a strong relationship. We're at the point in our lives where we own a small business that we operate on Saturdays together, have two beautiful old greyhounds, and are only a couple months away from moving into our dream house, which we purchased in 2020 and has undergone a ton of renovations. This was also stressful as we got a couple bad contractors before finding our current one, so a renovation process that should have taken 6 months has now been over 2 years in the making. We also want to expand our business soon to a standalone space and make it our full-time gig.

A few months ago, Dennis told me about one of his staff where he works. We'll call her Cheryl (25F). Dennis works in a small corporate cafe space. While Cheryl isn't his direct report, she is the employee of Dennis' co-manager (we'll call her Kinsey). Dennis and Kinsey work closely together to manage the space as a team, and Dennis often will ask Kinsey's staff to do tasks on her behalf if she's not available. The team is small and tight-knit, and regularly go out for beers and to play pool together.

Dennis told me that he and Cheryl have a flirty relationship at work (to the point where Kinsey had to tell Cheryl to dial it back a notch), and they had mutually expressed interest in each other. Cheryl has never been in an ENM relationship. He asked me my opinion about the situation. I told him truthfully that I thought it was a really bad idea to date a member of his staff from both an ethical perspective (power dynamic) and a logistical standpoint (citing his first relationship). As an HR professional in my day job, I also told him I'd be very hesitant to start a business or remain in a relationship with someone who couldn't draw that line in the sand. He was disappointed but seemed to take in and appreciate my perspective.

A week or two later, a stressful situation at his work happened after Dennis had gone out with his other partner. Cheryl had previously expressed that she didn't want to hear about his dates with other people (though has no problem hearing about me), but also was suspicious about his whereabouts the night before as he had simply told her he had ""plans."" He told her that he had been on a date, and she was cold to him the rest of the day and told him she didn't want to talk. Dennis ended up leaving work early because of the stress and toxicity, and Cheryl ended up calling out of work the next day. Dennis spent 48 hours feeling stressed out about the situation because she refused to talk to him, outside of a couple of passive aggressive messages along the lines of, ""How long have you been with this girl?"" and ""How long have you been lying to me?""

Eventually the situation cooled off and Cheryl did apologise for how she reacted, especially since they aren't together, and they went back to being flirty but platonic at work.

A few weeks ago, I noticed Dennis acting nervous and less affectionate than normal. He asked to talk. I made us dinner and he expressed that he is incredibly close with Cheryl and wanted to talk to me about the ethical implications about dating her. In summary:

* He isn't her direct manager, and doesn't have a lot of power over her outside of asking her to do some work-related tasks. He has no control of her pay, vacation, scheduling, etc.
* He is genuinely interested in a relationship with her and expressed that he would work hard to ensure there wouldn't be favouritism at work, and their feelings for each other are very strong.
* He spoke with others who work in the same industry as him, and the opinions he got validated his own feelings - as long as it can be kept professional at work, it shouldn't be an issue.
* He feels that she is open to learning about ENM, though admitted she hadn't yet cracked open the book he had loaned her about the subject.

I responded:

* Though he doesn't have admin-related powers over her, there is still a dynamic at play that creates invisible but tangible obstacles in the workplace for a manager-staff relationship.
* Even with the best intentions, there could be consequences such as: toxicity from other staff due to perceiving favouritism, real or imagined; the possibility of HR getting involved and them losing their jobs, drama from their relationship spilling over into work due to high emotions, etc. There are a million reasons that a manager-employee relationship can end badly that are outside of his control.
* They *hadn't even been dating* when she had had a jealousy blow up at him large enough to cause multi-day drama at work and in our home life. How does he truly expect to keep the level of professionalism immaculate if they actually do date?
* His first relationship had been a hot mess because he and the girl hadn't jointly done the work to build a solid foundation for an ENM relationship, that he was repeating the exact scenario now, and that I was going to lose patience for having to go through the identical predictable drama again.
* I would not stay with someone who couldn't see the ethical implications of dating their subordinate, nor would I start a business with someone with a history of doing so. I don't want to put my own livelihood and/or reputation at risk.

I also suggested that if this is something he really wants to pursue, there are many avenues for doing so that are a lot less of an ethical grey area. Such as:

* Waiting until they were no longer working together.
* Communicating with the company's HR department and seeing if one of them could be moved to a different space within the company, or at least examining their office dating policies.
* Find a different job, since he's been working at his current one for nearly a decade and hasn't been particularly happy with it in some time.

He was unhappy with all of these suggestions, as he wanted to act on these feelings so a relationship could develop organically, didn't want to get higher ups involved in his personal life, and doesn't want to have to force a big life change in changing jobs just to be in a relationship with her. He sees her every day and doesn't want to lose that. He just wants to be in a relationship with her.

It escalated into a horrible fight, and things have been tense between us ever since. He has since expressed that he feels I am restricting him in ""telling him who he can and can't date."" I can see why he feels this way, but I also don't feel that I can compromise my own ethics and feel good about staying with him. He's also now said that he's uncertain about everything now, including our relationship, expanding our business soon, and polyamory itself. He told me he has been ""unhappy for a while now."" He doesn't want to blow up his life and end our relationship, but he's upset and frustrated with my stance and is no longer certain about what he wants. He's even acknowledged perhaps this is due to NRE, but he feels so strongly for Cheryl that he feels ""stuck.""

He says that Cheryl makes him feel special. Makes him feel wanted. Tells him, ""You're my favourite person"" and calls him handsome at work all the time.

My heart is breaking. We've had several fights over and over about this. We've built a life together and it feels like it's slipping away. If he wants to be with Cheryl I don't want to stop him from pursuing her, but I just wish he could look at the situation with more clarity and go about it in a better way.

The other night when he went out for beers and pool with his staff, I was doing a bit of cleaning around our shared apartment when I found what looked like a pile of receipts on his nightstand. When I went to go throw them out, I realised they were 30+ love notes from Cheryl, calling him ""baby/handsome"" and saying things like, ""I just can't fucking help myself around you."" My heart was racing and when he got back, I asked him to be honest and tell me if he was already in a relationship with her. He told me no, that the notes were from much earlier, when Kinsey had to ask her to dial back the flirtiness, and before they'd had their conversation about remaining platonic. She's since toned down the constant note-leaving, but they made him feel special and he wanted to keep them. I put them in a jar so I wouldn't mistake them for receipts to throw out, and gave him the jar.

We've had a few more conversations about the situation and he did apologise for how he was acting towards me, but that he felt hurt, manipulated and controlled and was trying to not take it out on me. I asked him to still show up for our relationship and asked him to take the time and think things through before making any rash decisions. I think the situation is a combination of having an existential crisis combined with blinding NRE. I also feel as though me being busy for the last year (I was involved in several community theatre productions that took up a lot of my time) made me a less attentive and present partner. I've taken a break from theatre for my own mental well-being and to take more time to work on my relationships.

We've agreed to work on our relationship and seek advice from a poly-friendly therapist to work through this impasse, and to at least wait until we've moved back into our home in case part of the existential crisis has to do with us being in survival mode for the last couple of years (pandemic and the reno stress). He's considering a few avenues but isn't sure how to move forward, and we fundamentally disagree on the ethics of the situation.

Sorry for the long post. I don't feel like my ethics, perspective and boundaries are unreasonable, but I also don't want to come off as controlling of who he dates. Everything just feels like it sucks right now and I need to hear other perspectives.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/s/aYOWuF7aNS)  **May 19, 2023**

Update 2023-05-19:

Dennis had been cold to me all week, saying he needed time to think about what he wanted. We slept separately and he went out most nights this week, to visit family as well as have dinner with a friend. He said we'd talk on Sunday once he ""gathered his thoughts.""

I spent days being stone-walled, crying, with my stomach in knots. I lost a few pounds from no appetite and was in a holding pattern of terrible anxiety.

Finally, tonight when he came home from work, I set out a nice dinner and cocktails for us, and had taken care of his tasks for our Saturday business so he could relax. I couldn't hold myself together and started crying while I tried to eat, but then had to go to the bathroom to sob. He ignored me and kept eating while I cried.

I finally came back to the table and said I wanted to respect his wish to not talk until Sunday, but my anxiety was through the roof, and if our relationship was over, I wanted him to tell me rather than drag it out for days.

He finally said that it was over, and that he'd wanted to wait until Sunday to figure out what to say. He went on an impassioned speech about how he hadn't been happy in a long time and realised he just wasn't poly. I begged him to still go to therapy with me, even if it were just to get some closure and learn what we could have done better, and he refused, saying that he didn't believe therapy could fix us. I was upset and asked why, after 8 years, a house, and a business together, he couldn't have said something sooner, and why all of the life we built wasn't worth even considering therapy.

I then asked, again, if he was already with Cheryl.

He froze and said, ""We're really close, emotionally I guess.""

I asked, ""Did you sleep with her? Kiss her?""

He admitted he had kissed her. Yesterday. At work. While I was waiting for him at home, with my stomach in knots and staring down the barrel of our possible end. Before we ever got to our conversation on Sunday.

I am fucking devastated. He would never have admitted it until I dragged it out of him. He was my best friend and I'd always trusted his honesty.

I asked why he couldn't have been honest with me and he couldn't give me an answer.

I told him to pack a bag and get out of our apartment, and leave his keys behind. He's staying with his brother.

A fleet of people, including one of my other partners and some friends, rallied at my doorstep. All of them held me as I cried, reassured me as I asked why I wasn't worth going to therapy with, and told me my value wasn't predicated on Dennis' scummy behaviour and atrocious handling of the whole situation. They wouldn't let me clean up the half-eaten dinner still sitting on the table or walk my dogs myself. My one partner is sleeping beside me as I try (and fail) to get some sleep, and my friends are showing up tomorrow to work the cash register of my business in Dennis' absence.

Things suck a lot but it's good to have friends in your corner.

I'm going to be okay.

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/s/QjlERwfsRW)  **May 29, 2025**

Two years ago, during what I will refer to now as The Incident**‚Ñ¢**, I created two posts in quick succession about my NP (referred to as Dennis) wanting to date his employee (referred to as Cheryl).

TL;DR - Dennis did not want to consider any ethical way to date Cheryl, and ended up cheating, said, ""I'm just not poly,"" and imploded our relationship of 8 years.

**Disclaimer: This update is long as fuck. Enjoy the novel. It's been a long journey.**

Hello everyone,

I've been quiet on this subreddit, as it's taken me a couple of years to put the pieces of my life back together, which has been a process. I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for my community of friends and loved ones who have helped me bear the load when it was hardest, and made it possible to come into my own. A lot has happened, so I'll try to break everything down into distinct parts for ease of reading.

Life was extremely ugly for a long time, but I am so, so grateful for my friends.

**Part I: The Immediate Aftermath**

The day after The Incident, I had to wake up at 6:00 a.m. to run my business solo for the first time in three years. Two of my closest friends (I'll call them Rattrap and Loris) showed up and hopped behind the counter of the coffee bar I run to handle customers. One of my regulars, Elle, realised immediately that something was very wrong, and offered to hop on the till the next week while I worked on hiring staff. Rattrap, Loris, and Elle refused payment for the help, and it helped me not have to directly interact with any customers while I made a few hundred drinks in a state of shock and grief.

We made it through the first two weeks, and in that time, I placed job ads, interviewed candidates, and hired two staff to help bear the load.

The Tuesday after The Incident, which happened over a long weekend, I started a new contract position at a non-profit organisation, which does good work providing wraparound support to unhoused youth in my city. I had planned this transition prior to my life changing, leaving my full-time permanent position for what I believed to be a calling, and losing health and dental benefits in the process. Dennis had told me ten days prior to The Incident that he would ""support me in whatever way I needed"" with his company benefits, so I could pursue this role.

I sought therapy and tried to keep up with taking care of myself. I was still on Dennis' benefits as his spouse, but after one therapy session and dental appointment, he cut off benefits entirely, saying he had never agreed to helping me. I was on my own.

The first month, I stayed in the apartment I had shared with Dennis, while he stayed with his brother. I lost 20 lbs. because I had no appetite, and had to preplan very simple set meals (half a bag of salad from Costco + some sort of air-fried protein) to remember to eat. The lease on the apartment was coming due, and Loris (who at the time was escaping an abusive domestic situation) and I searched for a place to live together, and eventually found an apartment and signed a year-long lease.

I also sought legal counsel. Dennis, uncharacteristically on top of things, found counsel before I did. The lawyer he found was exceptionally sketchy, and harassed me daily by email while I searched for counsel of my own. I had fortunately drawn up documentation when we had first purchased our house that protected me from the possibility of him claiming 50% ownership, since I had provided 100% of the down payment, and when I did find my own lawyer, she was extremely happy I had all the receipts.

In the meantime, I had to finish renovations on the house we had purchased and had been 80% through renovating. For obvious reasons, we no longer had shared funds to finish renovations through our contractor, so I drew up a Gantt chart of everything that needed doing to wrap up and close our permits.

I held meetings with our renovation vendors to let them know what was happening, and luckily most of them were gracious and understanding. I asked Dennis if he would at least help split up the items that needed finishing so we could sell the house and part ways if it came to that. He got halfway through painting one room and put down three floorboards in the basement before he stormed out and texted me, claiming he was having a panic attack and couldn't do more. I had to walk him through his panic attack over text, and his lawyer followed up with a fairly nasty email telling me that ""forcing"" him to work on the house was ""harassment.""

And so began the year of hell...and healing.

**Part II: The Year of Hell and Healing**

Loris and I both landed in the safe space that was our new apartment. For the first time in a long time, both of us were in a stable living situation where the person we were living with wasn't prone to yelling and gaslighting. My two dogs seemed happier as well. I was cut off from therapy as I didn't have benefits, so I threw myself into cooking for the both of us and making tasty meals. It was therapeutic for me and supportive for her, and we created a lot of fantastic memories through food and hangouts.

My two staff at the coffee shop trained up fantastically, and I was soon able to take time off to alternate being able to decompress, as well as to work on home renovations. Dennis had been dead-set against hiring anyone, so this was the first time in years that I could have free Saturdays!

Working on the house was incredibly hard. There was a lot to do and being there was traumatic. This was supposed to be a forever home. We had custom-designed so many details together. I was lucky to have friends who could share the load, especially during weeks where all I wanted to do was scream and cry. I did flooring, painting, built stairs, tiled, installed trim, installed lighting, refinished a fireplace, installed barn doors, and demolished and rebuilt a failing fence. I managed to find inexpensive handymen who could finish the things I couldn't handle, such as plumbing and hard-to-reach areas for paint.

There was a bit of a hiccup when the home was broken into twice over the course of a weekend, and my tools (among other things) were stolen from the house. I have a wonderful community though, and Rattrap and Loris were there for me through the police reports and hysterical crying. I borrowed tools for cheap through the local tool library, which allowed me to press on.

My contract ended with the non-profit after six months, and I found a new contract role with an insurance company, covering for a maternity leave for one year. My performance with the former hadn't been great due to my mental health from the ongoing situation, and I was glad to get a chance for a clean slate at the new company.

My legal situation and finances were completely fucked. Due to the open permits on the house, and it being in varying stages of completeness through the year, I couldn't occupy the property, and was paying for a separate apartment with Loris. Dennis stopped paying for anything to do with our shared responsibilities - including his half of the mortgage on our house that was still in both our names, so I ended up having to pay for everything on my meagre salary in order for the house to not foreclose. At the same time, his lawyer were doing everything they could to drag out the separation process, and fighting me on everything, such as:

* I'd paid off $15k of his credit card debt and car loan in order for us to qualify for our original mortgage, with the intent he would pay this back at some point. He claimed it was now ""a gift.""
* He was furious about me keeping the dogs, and didn't ever inquire about how they were, but wanted to keep his favourite dog and leave the other with me. I put my foot down with this - his work often has him out of the house for 12 hours at a time, and at this point both dogs were seniors that had been together for nearly a decade. I was not about to separate them.
* He fought me on the costs of having to pay for half the house during the year we were separated, which thankfully were mostly quashed.
* He would take weeks/months to review and return revisions to our separation agreement, claiming he was ""stressed."" Though, interestingly enough, he somehow had the time and money to jet Cheryl and himself off on vacation to a different country.
* His lawyer and he got pissy over making arrangements for him to pick up his belongings from the house - which had been abandoned there for nearly a year. I'd begged him multiple times to remove them so that I could keep working on the house without all his stuff in the way. He wanted his belongings brought to my lawyer's office so that he could pick them up there. My lawyer thankfully squashed this pretty fast, citing several past emails she had sent detailing where his belongings could be picked up (that he'd agreed to and forgotten about).
* When we finally arranged for him to pick up his stuff, he missed the window we had agreed to, and instead broke into the house to drop off some of my items that he'd held onto since our separation had begun. Having stopped paying for anything to do with the house, and the draft separation agreement stipulating the property being signed over to me, he had effectively abandoned any controlling interest in the home, and he had no right to be there without any prior agreement. A neighbour's camera caught the break-in and my lawyer told him in no uncertain terms that if he pulled something like this again, we would be calling the police.

Eventually, a year after The Incident, the separation agreement was finally finalised and signed. After everything, Dennis was made to pay back the money I'd loaned him for his credit card debt and car payments, and I kept the house (he had no interest in anything to do with it) and dogs. He was also bound to a repayment plan for his half of all payments to do with the house from time of separation until the agreement was signed.

**Part III: Pushing Forward**

It would be remiss of me to not talk about my community. I had an outpouring of support from those I loved. People made me meals, got me out of the house, helped me make good memories, rallied together to help me finish renovations, co-signed my house and helped me list it on the market, and contributed financially. I have been so incredibly fortunate to have a village behind me - especially since my relationship with Dennis had largely isolated me from my greater community for many years, since he had displayed jealousy of my circle of friends.

We eventually arranged for Dennis and I to meet at the house one last time to pick up his belongings. This was the first time I had seen him in-person in over a year. I brought Rattrap, Loris, and another friend, Bullfinch, as my support. Rattrap and Loris dealt directly with Dennis to ensure he didn't make off with any of my possessions, while Bullfinch and I hung out within eyeshot but outside of speaking distance.

As Dennis stepped out of his car, Bullfinch leaned over to me and asked, incredulously, ""Does his affair partner have an mpreg fetish?""

The year had not been kind to Dennis. He had always been a slim person, but it looked as though he'd spent much of the last year in the bottle. He'd made making cocktails at home his whole personality for a while before The Incident, and it didn't look like he'd stopped. A shirt that I remember fitting him nicely once upon a time was stretched painfully over an obvious beer belly. His hair was greasy and looked as though he hadn't cut it in a long time, paired morosely with scraggly, unkempt facial hair.

This is not meant to body-shame, but to illustrate a stark difference. The painful narrative in my head had been that he had run off into the sunset with Cheryl for an amazing new life, while I was left with the broken pieces, and the reality in front of me sat in stark contrast to this. Possibly a little petty, but a colleague had treated me to my first set of pretty nails, I had a little makeup on, and I was looking cute in a sundress. I had taken up running, and this paired with the workout from constant renovations...I looked *good*.

Dennis and I didn't speak a word to each other, and after he drove off (in his beat up old car that sounded like the transmission was going to go any second), I never saw him again.

My new new job went much better than my previous new job as I was pulling myself out of the mire. Halfway through my contract, my company created a new role specific to my recruitment talent, and offered this to me on a full-time, permanent basis. I didn't have to worry about finding the next job after my contract ended.

That being said, it certainly wasn't all roses. My mental health was shattered for a long time, and it wasn't until I was in my role full-time that I started receiving health benefits again. I started going to therapy again as soon as I was able, and started detangling the twisted threads of what I now realise was abuse.

Lessons from therapy:

* The feeling of walking on eggshells in a relationship is not normal
* Having to constantly de-escalate your partner in a relationship is not normal
* What I believed to be a ""superpower"" of ""being able to read people"" is actually a trauma response called *hypervigilance*
* I was taking on nearly all the emotional and logistical labour in the relationship, and I didn't have to accept this from this or future relationships
* Expecting a partner to take on their own emotional accountability is perfectly reasonable and should be the bare minimum in this and future relationships
* Being cheated on and left behind had nothing to do with me and my value, but the choices that Dennis had made - they had to do with him

I started working on myself. I worked out more, took time to relax, took up crocheting as a hobby, and spent more time nurturing friendships. I took myself on self-dates and started making more friends in the local kink/queer community.

My small business won the top spot in a community award for best coffee shop in the city, thanks to my amazing staff who worked hard every weekend.

I successfully completed a wedding officiant course with Humanist Canada, and will be officiating the weddings of a few friends in the upcoming months. Dennis had been very critical of me signing up for this, so it felt very nice to get my certificate of endorsement. I can now also joke that I am the ultimate poly person, since I'm ""marrying everyone.""

As of this week, I've gotten a mental health assessment with a psychiatrist, and it appears that I have symptoms aligning with CPTSD/BPD/GAD from everything that's been going on. I'll be working with them as well as my GP to start some therapies in the near future. This gives me hope that I'll be able to live and love again in the ways that bring me and those around me joy.

**Part IV: Relationships**

I decided to put this in a separate section, since relationships largely took a backseat to the rest of my life.

Soon after The Incident, I de-escalated relationships with both of my other partners. I couldn't bring myself to engage in romantic relationships. I felt broken and like my entire world had shattered below my feet. I felt repulsed and terrified by the idea of intimacy. Later, through some hard, honest conversations, we found that we worked better as friends, and remain so to the present day.

In the months that followed, I went through cycles of utterly despising the idea of relationships as well as desperately needing validation, closeness, and connection. I swiped sporadically and listlessly through dating apps, even though my mentality was still very broken, and I engaged in a few self-destructive one night stands before calling it quits on anything remotely close to dating.

Several months later, I met Stanley (35M), a single dad and workaholic who was similarly somewhat recently separated from a long-term partner. We had a lot in common, and neither of us were looking for anything particularly committed. We enjoyed each other's company where we could in our busy lives, and his kindness made me start re-evaluating what I wanted out of partnerships. He was consistent, understanding, and competent without me asking, even though we were only seeing each other casually, and this started making me realise how much I had abandoned myself in my relationship with Dennis.

Stanley was an incredible rock for me during this time, and was happy to listen to me vent about my situation. He also had a background in construction and was very happy to give pointers about my various renovation projects, even taking time to help me build a new fence.¬†He was there when I was supposed to meet Dennis at the house to do a final possessions exchange, but my car was t-boned and totaled on the way (I was okay!). Stanley went ahead to the house so we'd be there on time‚Ä¶and Dennis missed the meeting anyway.

We enjoyed each other's company for a long time, but there were eventually some compatibility issues we couldn't reconcile. With my mental health a long way from being recovered, I found myself developing limerence for Stanley, feeling anxious and uncertain when he was out of touch for a long time. He wasn't the most communicative person, and while he liked me a lot, he wasn't in a place in his life to reciprocate my feelings. Some therapy and self-work later, we ended our partnership. We are still friends and talk frequently, but we ultimately weren't compatible as partners.

I spent a few months being intentionally single. I put together a list of what I would want in my ideal partner, and worked with my therapist to detangle some of my trauma.

I asked myself, ""Who would I want to be, if I knew I were going to die alone?""

This might sound morbid, but the most important relationship, I was growing to realise, was the one with myself. I took myself out on a lot more self-dates, took up new hobbies, and spent time with friends. I spent time alone, sitting with myself and becoming more and more comfortable in my own solitude.

And I decided I would no longer look for relationships. For the first time in a long time, I felt at peace.

Around Halloween of last year, a friend was going through their own separation, and wanted to go to a Halloween-themed local kink event to rediscover the scene post-breakup. They asked if I could go with them for moral support, as they were worried their ex might show up. I agreed and decided I'd go and have fun. I dressed up as an (extra slutty, if that's possible) Betty Boop and went with my friend. They quickly got into their scenes and I was glad to provide company when their ex did show up (we joked that I was a much hotter date than the ex).

While my friend was otherwise occupied, I met a lot of cool people in the local kink scene! I got chatting with folks and started making some friends, and even got to engage in some pickup play with a stranger. I'm happy to say all these new humans make up a cool new social circle that I regularly hang out with these days.

Among the people I met was a person I'll call Q (28M). He found and vouched for the pickup play person, and helped introduce me to a number of folks that would go on to be my friends. During the night we got chatting. He was very attractive - insert your own stereotype of a tall, dark, and handsome stranger here - and a complete neurodivergent oddball like me. In the midst of a sea of people in various scenes, among a cacophony of moans and screams, we got into a delightfully energetic 20-minute conversation...about the type of bread we were making (he was into focaccia and I was into sourdough - I showed him my sourdough journal Google doc because I'm very good at flirting).

At the end of the night, when I was saying goodbye to everyone, Q came up to me, and, his voice shaking with nerves, asked if I'd like to go out sometime. He was leaving for a business trip in the next couple of days, and didn't want me to disappear into the night to never see me again. I hesitated, because this wasn't what I'd gone into the night looking for, but something made me say yes, exchange info, and agree to chat while he was away.

Sadly, these first meetings are never as good as the ones in movies, and we ended up discovering some incompatibilities right off the bat. While neither of us were particularly interested in a serious relationship, both of us were subs, and he was aro. I was also older than him by a few years, which made me nervous. I was worried about being with someone younger - I had bad memories of having to coach/drag Dennis through stages of maturity and had no desire to do this again.

Still, we continued talking, and had a casual first date once he was back. He hosted; I made Nashville hot chicken. We wore masks because he was a bit under the weather, and I was set to perform at a Santa Claus parade a couple weeks later, so no intimate contact. However, there was an undeniable physical chemistry...and I made some damn good chicken.

We kept seeing each other, and I kept discovering things about Q that I assumed were ""relationship fantasy football roster""-level qualities - he regularly went to therapy, was reflective and accountable for his behaviours, was committed to and educated on polyamory, took initiative to plan dates without prompting, and was very sweet and kind about my situation. I had been upfront about this, as my mental health was not fully recovered, and my finances prevented me from being out on a lot of fancy, ""spend money""-type dates.

We also shared a lot of things in common: a love for gabbing at each other about pretty much anything, an unhinged sense of humour, similar cultural traumas (kids of immigrants to the front!), passion for helping people, engagement in politics, love for cooking and baking, and desire to go on silly little adventures. At the same time, we had good boundaries for ourselves and had our own hobbies - he had been into martial arts for years and coached at his local gym, and I had recently taken up crochet. We both had a mutual respect for both of us wanting to be our own humans.

We were able to be vulnerable and open up to each other in ways neither of us were familiar with, and this was healing for both of us. We discovered that this vulnerability allowed us to be incredibly sexually compatible as well, and we discovered that feeling safe with each other let us both explore our switchy sides in a mutually fulfilling way. My libido returned in a huge way - by the end of my relationship with Dennis, I had come to the reluctant realisation I was ace, but this was actually from the constant mothering I had to do.

He also ended up being one of the most romantic people I have ever met - but his brand of romance (consistency and thoughtfulness as opposed to grand gestures) had just never really landed with previous partners.

The first time we said ""I love you"" was on Christmas morning.

He surprises me with thoughtful gifts. I crochet him little wearables for the cold. When I'm feeling sad or upset, he asks, ""How can I best support you?"" When we talk about other partners, the conversations are thoughtful and keep everyone's feelings and needs in mind. Reasonable concerns I bring up are validated and heard rather than dismissed. When we have issues, it's us versus the problem rather than each other. When either of us are triggered from trauma, we greet each other with patience and understanding rather than apathy and disdain. We laugh until we cry, support each other in the things we love, and feel truly treasured by each other.

He amazes me every single day...>!and makes me cum a LOT.!<

My healing journey isn't over, and I will continue to work on myself. And the realist in me knows it's still early days. But it brings me joy to know that I am safe and cherished, and it brings me hope that this kind of love can exist after a long hard road.

I'm not one to believe in omens, but I find it poetic that after everything, I've found such a wonderful anchor partner, whose name - translated to English - means ""King of One Thousand Compassions.""

Thanks for reading.

The first day was great, I had a bunch of energy and the will to actually use it and i cleaned up my room and went on a walk, though it only lasted about 1-2 hours roughly and dropped off. The next few days was the same but without the heightened energy, just feeling a bit more able to get things done and stop binge eating but then it drops off. I had coffee two mornings with the Vyvanse and it made me feel super anxious like no matter what I do its not good enough and just feel very overwhelmed with life and everything in general so I've stopped having caffeine now.

After the whole anxious coffee days and restricting caffeine, I've found the Vyvanse isn't really working ? Its been 3 days now and I'm back to binge eating, laying in bed, just getting nothing done at all accompanied by feeling really depressed (Not new but had been feeling really good for a week before starting Vyvanse) and its kicking my ass and I just hate the feeling. I'm trying to make an appointment to discuss this and hopefully do something about the meds not working but it could take a while as I had to go through DCJ to get my appointments paid for and I really don't want to keep taking these without it doing anything and feeling bummed.

Today I tried taking one 30mg tablet and then taking another half so I was taking 45mg today, same as before didn't really do much, had a bit of motivation to get stuff done but then a quick mood shift to it being like ""what's the point I cant do anything, life sucks"". Basically I want to know if I should just take two 30mg tablets tomorrow and hope for the best, I'm sick of feeling like this and just want something that works and don't want to wait for the whole process of the appointment getting paid for and booking it to do anything about feeling this shitty way.",1,1749096171.0,ADHDmeds,0,1.0,False

1l3pt29,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3pt29,Black Vault has Fallen - Ralph‚Äôs fury (2019),"Author‚Äôs note: This is a rewrite of ‚ÄúPaz.‚Äù This is also a long chapter. Enjoy! 

Ocoro, northern Bolivia

Elcira Paz could not shake the feeling that something was off when she got in the car that was to drive her from the restaurant in Moko to her residence in Campo de Ana, Ocoro.

For the past five months she had been collaborating with Bolivian journalist Lupe Vera on the wave of violence plaguing Bolivia and the data hack that was seemingly connected to it.

That proved to be quite a pain: almost everyone they had talked to was unwilling to divulge anything, as if talking about it would unleash something far worse. 

If only‚Ä¶

The collision sent the phone flying out of Paz‚Äôs hands as the car lurched forward. First, she heard shouts of alarm as her cartel guards reached for their weapons.

Then Paz screamed as bullets pelted the vehicle. ‚ÄúStay down, senorita!‚Äù One of the guards cried, readying his assault rifle.

‚ÄúDamn it, it‚Äôs the enemy!‚Äù Someone else shouted. ‚ÄúOpen Fi-!‚Äù

The man‚Äôs head exploded before he could finish.

Suddenly, the car was spinning and Paz was clutching the headrest of the driver‚Äôs seat, screaming as her vision became a blur of motion.

Then the car slammed into a nearby tree, sending Paz‚Äôs head smashing into the passenger side door.

Her vision swam as she caught sight of several blurry figures running towards the vehicle. They were all able-bodied men, with heavyset builds. They wore a mix of civilian clothing and urban camouflage military uniforms, with balaclavas concealing some of the men‚Äôs faces.

Then she screamed as she felt a gloved hand clamp across her mouth. Paz thrashed like a dog, trying desperately to bite her attacker‚Äôs hand.

Two seconds later, she felt her hands being pinned behind her and duct tape being wrapped around her wrists.

Then the hand was removed and Paz began pleading with the captors in both Spanish and English. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt me, por favor! My family has money! They can pay you!‚Äù

Her words were muffled as one of her captors plastered a strip of tape over her mouth. Then a bag was pulled over her head and she felt herself being dragged out of the vehicle.

Paz continued screaming as she was half-dragged, half-carried away from the vehicle, before being thrown into the trunk of what looked like a van.

‚Äú¬°Vamanos! Let‚Äôs get out of here,‚Äù One of her captors shouted before the van sped off.

The kidnapping had taken about thirty seconds. Paz was sure nobody saw her being taken.

‚Ä¶

It was about 7:30 PM when Ralph Rager arrived in Pujio, in Ocoro Province. By this time, the coffee he‚Äôd gulped down back at the safe house had kicked in and he was wide awake.

For the past several weeks, Rager had been trying to forage for intel on the least suspicious way of escaping the country ever since the wave of violence happened. He knew it was a matter of time before Santa Blanca or La Unidad found Adam Rorke, his girlfriend Amber and himself. 

The previous evening he‚Äôd gotten a tip from an anonymous informant claiming to have found information on a possible safe exit from Bolivia. The guy gave Rager a series of coordinates leading to a restaurant in Campo Ana. He‚Äôd been told that the area would be on a public area, with plenty of people around to hide him from SB. 

But the street where the address was located was empty. 

Rager‚Äôs senses immediately went on high alert. Was the source compromised and had he been lured into a trap? Or was his source a Santa Blanca mole? 

That wasn‚Äôt the only problem. 

The street itself was empty. 

Rager scanned the street for threats. 

Then Rager saw it: a lone figure in the shadows. At first, Rager thought it was the source, awaiting his arrival. But then Rager took a step closer and saw that the guy didn‚Äôt have the right build. He wasn‚Äôt even the right height.

Then Rager saw the glint of a suppressor in the moonlight. Taking a step closer, he noticed that said suppressor was attached to an FN Five Seven. The gun itself appeared to be custom made, the pistol modified to be integrally suppressed. 

*Could be a plainclothes UNIDAD goon.* He thought. *Proceed with caution.*

The man then began moving towards an alley and Rager followed, taking measured steps as he followed the man‚Äôs shadow. This served two purposes: to keep the guy from realizing he‚Äôd been made, and it allowed Rager to use the various windows and rear view mirrors of vehicles to watch the watcher. 

Rager continued following the man through a maze of alleys. But just as he was about to round a corner, the shadow disappeared.

The man was gone. 

*Damn it. He‚Äôs probably trying to flank you right now!* Rager thought. 

Then Rager heard voices from the right and followed them. He found myself navigating towards a gated fence. Noticing the gate was slightly ajar, he paused, stomped his foot firmly into the dirt in case the suspicious person came back, before blasting through in a sprint. 

Then Rager heard two screams-one from a man and one from a woman. They came from the left.

Following the sound, Rager traversed through another alley, then made a right.

That‚Äôs when Rager found myself at an abandoned schoolyard.

In front of him was a gruesome scene: several gunmen wearing signature red-and-green military fatigues, except some of them were also wearing black.

They were surrounding a man wearing a flannel shirt and jeans, a bag taped over his head. He was tied to a cross. 

One of the goons was guarding a young woman, her hands tied behind her and duct tape wrapped around her mouth and head. 

She was the one who was screaming.

The man was screaming, his words muffled behind the bag. 

Was he the woman‚Äôs father? Brother? Husband? Boyfriend?

It didn‚Äôt matter. These monsters needed to be stopped.

One of the men picked up a container of kerosene and began dousing the man on the cross with it. Rager‚Äôs eyes widened in horror. They were going to burn him alive in front of the woman!

Rager immediately went for the pistol on his leg holster just as the guy lit a match. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù Rager raised the gun.

It was too late. By the time his finger pulled the trigger, the match was already thrown, the man‚Äôs body engulfing into flames right as the 9mm round drilled through his murderer‚Äôs head. 

The burning guy‚Äôs agonized screams mixed with Ralph‚Äôs howls of rage as he began taking medium range potshots at the attackers. The next guy to meet his Maker was the one holding the woman hostage. Rager sent another 9mm round through the guy‚Äôs jaw before finishing him off with another shot to his throat. He went down clawing at his neck.

Rager was seeing red, his breath coming out in angry huffs as he moved through the alley towards the carnage, squeezing the trigger each time the pistol‚Äôs sights snapped onto target. 

He never saw the massive man barreling towards him. By the time Rager did take notice, he found himself staring at the barrel of a Colt M1911A1 handgun, its grips decorated with Santa Blanca‚Äôs logo. 

At first, Rager felt his entire body shaking. 

But the shock of being caught off guard was quickly replaced by bloodlust. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Rager snarled, grabbing the barrel of the handgun with one hand while using the other to push the button that ejected the mag and sent it falling to the ground. Then he racked the slide, ejecting the bullet from its chamber and rendering the gun useless. 

The whole maneuver happened so fast, it froze the man in his tracks. 

Before the man could even react, Rager fired off a lightning jab that obliterated his nose and sent a tidal wave of blood into his mouth. The man shouted in pain, but Ralph wasn‚Äôt done. 

The next shot was to his solar plexus. The man retched, and I saw his breath in the form of a crimson mist that stained the front of his shirt.

The rage in Ralph‚Äôs eyes was as hot as a blowtorch. This guy was going to be a broken, bleeding mess by the time Ralph was finished. 

Rager drove his knee into the man‚Äôs groin, followed by a snapping of the forearm to the man‚Äôs throat that sent the man staggering backward.

The man retched once again, before sending a looping hand slicing through the air. Rager ducked under the blow, then uppercut the man in the jaw! 

Rager felt the man‚Äôs teeth and jawbone exploding upon impact with his fist! He relished it; scumbags like him deserved to be steamrolled. 

The man groaned in pain, and Rager looked towards the corpse of the burned civilian on the cross. 

Then Rager sneered as I kicked the attacker right into the burning cross. His groans became muffled screams as his body was set on fire on impact with the burning cross. He collapsed to the floor, his muffled screams continuing for about two-three seconds before finally falling silent. 

Rager turned to the woman, who was now staring at him with horrified eyes. Rager‚Äôs look of bloodlust and fury instantly transitioned to concern and he walked over and unwrapped the tape from her head. 

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Rager asked, before walking behind the woman and cutting her wrists free. 

The woman immediately turned and embraced Ralph in a hug, thanking him profusely in both Spanish and English. 

Rager gently shushed her before asking, ‚ÄúWho was the guy they burned?‚Äù

The woman let out a strangled sob as she buried her face in her hands. 

‚ÄúM-my father,‚Äù She whimpered.

‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù Rager asked.

The woman looked up at him, tears still brimming her eyes. ‚ÄúMy name is Elcira. Elcira Paz.‚Äù 

‚ÄúName‚Äôs Ralph Rager,‚Äù Ralph said, shaking her hand. ‚ÄúAnd de nada.‚Äù 

It was then that Adam Rorke appeared, followed by Amber Halford. They looked at Rager, then at the bodies strewn all over the place. 

‚ÄúRemind me not to get on your bad side,‚Äù said Rorke.

I've been buying quality beans from Atlas Coffee Club for a few years now, but up until recently, I have been grinding the beans with a $99 Capresso burr grinder. The ground coffee was used for a Moka pot, a vintage Chemex pourover, and a Keurig K-Cup universal ground coffee holder. Overall, the coffee flavor was meh. Then I found a KitchenAid dual-boiler espresso maker made by Gaggia for less than $150 delivered. After repairing the espresso maker and lurking on the Gaggia and Espresso feeds for awhile I made a few upgrades and equipment purchases including a Shardor Professional flat burr grinder.

From my constant reading of this and other feeds having to do with espresso, coffee beans, and coffee in general, I have gained a lot of knowledge that I have been able to apply towards obtaining what I feel is my perfect espresso shot.

It seems to me that more attention is dedicated towards the formulas and times widely accepted for obtaining the shot, or shots, of espresso instead of looking and listening. I have been very happy with flavors and aromas I've obtained with my 2006 KitchenAid by observing the espresso as it comes out of the bottomless portafilter for the change in flow opacity instead of using a timer, and listening to the minute changes in the sound of the pump when I pull a shot. I don't feel I've failed when pulling the shot if I don't get crema 1/4 inch thick that stays in the cup for 5 minutes, but I am getting crema.

I have been using the Coffeeza coffee pod machine for the last 4 years, but now want to move on to a semi-automatic machine. 

I would love to have a machine at home that can produce great espresso shots (double preferred). I have looked at both the Agarro models, but have mixed opinions and am not sure if they would make great shots. 

Budget is not a big concern, but I don't want to spend 50k right now for a machine. I want to gradually move on to better and more expensive ones later on. ",2,1749095631.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

Are we product/outcome of the Code?,"Hey fellow human beings, ever get lost thinking about why we‚Äôre here or what the universe is up to? Is our DNA like a cosmic USB drive, gravity the universe‚Äôs Wi-Fi, and humans the latest app in a 13.8-billion-year-old program? Grab a coffee, and let‚Äôs unpack this!

DNA: 

The Universe‚Äôs Memory StickPicture your DNA as a tiny hard drive packed with life‚Äôs blueprints. It‚Äôs got this code (A, T, C, G) that tells your body how to build you‚Äîkinda like a 750 MB file of ‚Äúyou‚Äù instructions. In geeky terms, it‚Äôs ‚Äúlow-entropy,‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs super organized, storing info for life. Since the Big Bang, the universe went from a neat, tidy start to a messy sprawl, and DNA‚Äôs how it keeps track of complex stuff like us.

Gravity: 

The Cosmic Wi-FiOkay, gravity‚Äôs not just why we don‚Äôt float away‚Äîit‚Äôs like the universe‚Äôs signal. Back at the Big Bang, everything was a hot soup, but gravity pulled bits together to make stars, planets, and us. It‚Äôs like the wiring that carries the universe‚Äôs ‚Äúmessage‚Äù across time, setting the stage for life. Without it, no DNA, no humans, no nothing.

Humans: 

The Universe‚Äôs Newest TrickSo, here we are‚Äîhumans! Evolution spent billions of years tweaking DNA to make us, and now we‚Äôre building rockets (SpaceX, anyone?) and AI (like xAI‚Äôs Grok). Musk‚Äôs Rogan chat about AI and Maher talk on free speech made me think: Are we the universe‚Äôs big project? We‚Äôre not just sitting around like evolution‚Äôs other creations‚Äîwe‚Äôre hacking our own code and aiming for Mars!

Are Aliens Calling the Shots?
Here‚Äôs the fun part: What if some cosmic beings are watching? Total sci-fi, I know, but what if DNA‚Äôs their code for building life? Maybe they‚Äôre collecting data, running a universe-sized experiment, or fighting chaos (that‚Äôs entropy, the universe‚Äôs tendency to get messy). Musk loves this ‚Äúare we in a simulation?‚Äù stuff‚Äîmaybe he‚Äôs onto something!What‚Äôs Next When We‚Äôre Gone?When we die, our DNA stops, and things get messy (entropy wins). But our books, AI, and space probes (like Voyager) could carry our story forward. If aliens are out there, they might save our DNA‚Äôs info for their cosmic scrapbook.

1l3phqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l3phqa/ruined_my_relationship_and_not_sure_what_to_do/,Ruined my relationship and not sure what to do,"My (20m) gf (20f) have been together for a little over 3 years now. I‚Äôm her first boyfriend, kiss, everything. She‚Äôs my first serious and long-term relationship and I honestly consider her my first everything and real love too. She's beautiful, wonderful, amazing, and incredibly sweet. She‚Äôs so smart hilarious and witty.  She‚Äôs the type of person to go out of her way and help you without even asking. She‚Äôs the type of person who will listen to you talk about your problems the first time she meets you. She‚Äôs a wonderful woman and I love her more than life itself and I do mean that. I‚Äôve never met another living soul like her and I‚Äôm certain that there is quite literally, no else like her.  We met in high school and were friends at first and had some of the same mutual friends. She comes from a very strict and religious family and when we met she was basically in her shell still.  She got me to go to Church with her, but she didn‚Äôt invite me, I simply wanted to go with her so I could be closer to her. Going to church is something I haven‚Äôt done in years, before I met her I didn‚Äôt even believe in God anymore and she somehow got me to go and take the steps to get my first communion. There‚Äôs so much I‚Äôve changed and have done for this girl and I don‚Äôt have any regrets. Her mom used to constantly berate her and treat her just so awful. I hated whenever she would tell me about the things her mom did to her or said to her. I always speak my mind about everything and I‚Äôm never afraid to open my mouth when I see BS or something that just didn‚Äôt sit right with me. So I‚Äôve always given her my two cents and told her how I would approach the situation and deal with things. But whenever I do she always says the same ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just how they are‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine I deal with it all the time‚Äù. She‚Äôs becoming more assertive now and I‚Äôve been helping her come more and more out of her shell little by little.

This all started a little after our first anniversary had passed. I one night got very drunk and thought it would be a good idea to text some girl I used to mess with, dumb very dumb I know. I was trying to apologize for something irrelevant I did and she flirts with me and I didn‚Äôt try to stop it. She got nude on FaceTime (she called me I don‚Äôt remember why) and it just went from there. I don‚Äôt know wtf I was thinking and realized the mistake and regretted it the second it was over. I never once cheated in my life and never thought I would mainly because of how I saw my dad treat my mom when I was growing up and never wanted to be like that when I was married. (He didn't cheat or anything he was just an asshole when he was drunk and would leave for a night or two but come back like nothing happened). Anyway, the following day we hang out and the guilt is just eating me alive the whole day and she can tell something‚Äôs wrong. I finally cave in once I drop her off and tell her everything that happened. She‚Äôs visibly pissed but quiet but she starts bawling her eyes out and yelling at me and saying things like ‚ÄúHow could you do this to me‚Äù. I just stand there crying and apologizing and she settles down and says she has to think about it. The next day she forgives me but she‚Äôs never going to forget about this, and her trust in me is nonexistent and I have to prove myself from now on. I stopped drinking right then and there. Her anxiety is at an all-time high and her confidence has been crushed. I do everything I can after that and try constantly reassure her by sending pics of where I‚Äôm at and who I‚Äôm with and telling her every little detail about my day that I can think of. Even when at work I would constantly update her. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to prove I‚Äôm trying.

Fast forward next year into February and I‚Äôm going to some commuter college 2 hours away twice a week. I‚Äôm in some communications class and we get into groups and I‚Äôm put into a group full of girls. No biggy, I don‚Äôt do anything but show up to class do my work and keep my conversations outside of class professional. (We had to share numbers to work on the project outside of class on Zoom). I don‚Äôt tell my gf anything because well I don‚Äôt think she would be thrilled about me being in a group full of girls and having their numbers. The semester ends, I lose their numbers then the next thing you know spring starts. I‚Äôm still commuting 2 hours because I already signed up for a full year of classes and paid for my books. I run into one of the girls from my old group and we have a quick chat before I go back to class. After I got home she messaged me and we chatted and she asked when I was free to grab coffee at school. I think nothing of it and accept her invitation. Well for the next few weeks, we‚Äôre just talking like normal and we occasionally meet at school to talk or grab a coffee or whatever. I don‚Äôt mention anything to my gf because well, I had no intentions with this girl other than just being friends and I thought what she didn‚Äôt know couldn‚Äôt hurt her. I know you‚Äôre thinking that I‚Äôm a dick and in reality, I am for everything I‚Äôve done but unfortunately, I‚Äôm not done yet. Gf eventually finds out by going through my phone one day while hanging out and I‚Äôm asleep on the couch. She confronts me and demands I take her home. I tell her everything, that she‚Äôs just a friend and that nothing is going on but she‚Äôs not believing me and I don‚Äôt blame her. All I can do is try to explain myself but the car ride to her house is silent. I drop her off and not a word is said. On the drive home, I‚Äôm thinking that it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm not getting a third chance and this is it. I got back home and we started texting I don‚Äôt remember everything but we basically didn‚Äôt see or talk much to each other. It wasn‚Äôt until the third day that we met and she said she believed me and forgave me but didn‚Äôt want me to hide anything. Anyway, I go full recovery mode. Everything I was doing before but like x10. I also gave her access to my phone whenever she wanted to see it. Basically from last April up until today I‚Äôve been trying and using everything in my power that I‚Äôm not hiding anything and that this relationship is all I want. In the beginning, though it was very stressful. I commute 2 hours to and from work daily. So in total 4 hours of driving. I get home very late, like 7-8 ish sometimes even 9. Whenever I would get home she would immediately want me to come over and spend time with her. This went on for months and it was completely draining my physical energy and causing me to wake up late for work. I didn‚Äôt want to tell her anything because, hey I‚Äôm a fucking asshole so why should I complain after what I did? But then there was more. Basically, anytime I didn‚Äôt spend at work or school was always with her or on the phone with her. I love spending time with her but juggling these three things at the same time was so stressful for me. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything, in my mind this wasn‚Äôt even a punishment for me, this was me making up for the mistakes I made and building up trust again in the relationship. So I bit my tongue, but then she would constantly bring up people in her life or online and it would seemingly be normal. She would mention a coworker or woman internet celebrity and some relationship they have with their bf, and all these stories had the same thing in common. Their bf or husband cheated on them and fumbled and whenever she would tell me I always felt like she was targeting me and it would constantly make me feel bad.  Then it started with her asking who a bunch of girls on social media I followed were. Everyone I follow I either know in person or went to school with. Every girl I was following/followed by was a friend from a previous school I went to than the one we met at. She would tell me she felt insecure and anxious about all the girls I was following and that even tho they were my friends they could still have bad intentions. I know they didn‚Äôt because every time I posted her they would like and comment saying how beautiful she is. (Plus half of them had bfs who I knew and was cool with). But I didn‚Äôt say anything and just unfollowed them. After that things seemed normal but she would need constant reassurance 24/7. I constantly feel ashamed and blame myself for everything that I‚Äôve put this poor girl through. This caused me to spiral and made me utterly depressed and ashamed of myself not only as a bf but as a man. I was attending therapy for a little over a year at this point and I‚Äôve been telling them everything that‚Äôs happened but I felt like it was just a waste of time because I knew what was wrong with me and what I needed to do to fix it. But all I could was think about how horrible I am for what I did. In the end, I canceled the therapy because I wanted to just see if I could handle it on my own at that point. I didn‚Äôt. I ended up spiraling even more and broke down twice and told gf that we couldn‚Äôt be together because she was too good for me and I didn‚Äôt deserve her. I attempted to end the relationship twice (the first time back in September of last year and the most recent was in March I believe) and she stopped me both times and was the one to reassure me and told me that she still loves me and knows that I‚Äôm a good person. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve been a lot more moody lately whenever we go out, not at her but because I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in the same room as her anymore. Every time we go out or we‚Äôre together I‚Äôm just sad and angry at myself and she can notice it always. The other day we hung out and I was in a bad mood the whole time we spent together I just wanted it to be over and leave and go home, again not because of her, but just because I didn‚Äôt feel like I was good enough to even be seen with her in public. I feel like the relationship ended the second I cheated and honestly can‚Äôt even look at myself the same anymore. She says she‚Äôs scared that I‚Äôm going to leave her and truthfully I feel like she‚Äôs more attached than in love with me simply because I am her first. I remember the way I acted during and after the relationship with my first ex and it wasn‚Äôt pretty tbh. The only reason I haven‚Äôt said anything again is that I don‚Äôt want to seem like the boy who cried wolf again and chickened out because she showed me compassion. Also, one of the main reasons why I haven‚Äôt left yet is because of her anxiety. It was so bad last year and she was also stressing a lot at her job and with her family. To top it off a lot of her friends and our mutual friends barely even talked to her so she didn‚Äôt have anyone outside of me or her family to talk to or support her if we did break up. Somehow I‚Äôm the one getting reassurance now and she constantly reminds me that she forgives me what I did and she wants to start a life with me. But I can‚Äôt imagine being with someone I‚Äôve hurt and wronged. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I don‚Äôt even think I want to get married anymore or have a family because of this and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her without breaking her heart. The truth is I know she can do so much better than me and I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so scared to lose her. I know it‚Äôs selfish of me but I do love this girl but I fear that I‚Äôm only going to hold her back and I only want to try to make things right by taking myself out of the picture. Right now I feel like it would be an appropriate time mainly because her confidence has been cranked up at least 11 notches and her anxiety is almost completely gone. She also got a new job which she loves and has met some new friends there. There‚Äôs never a good time for these things but I figured waiting till her other situations were better was the best idea I could think of instead of kicking her when she was already down. I‚Äôve caused this poor woman so much pain and suffering and made her self-conscious and insecure about herself when she has only ever loved and cared about me. All I see when I look at her is her face the night she cried her eyes out to me. I can‚Äôt believe I did this to my sweet girl, I just wanted to make her happy. What should I do? Thanks

TLDR: I cheated on my gf and she forgave me and reassures me everything‚Äôs ok but the guilt and shame and more importantly harm that I‚Äôve cause her have made spiral down this hole. I feel like taking my myself out of the picture and breaking up is the solution but I don‚Äôt want to break her heart.",1,1749095021.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

---

*[A sprawling cafe woven into an ancient tree, its furniture grown rather than built, sunlight dappled through enchanted leaves. The scent of cinnamon bark tea and wildflower scones fills the air. A small sign outside reads: **‚Äú‚ò†Ô∏è WARNING: WILD HUMAN LOOSE. DO NOT FEED. DO NOT ENCOURAGE. DO NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS.‚Äù**]*

**Zalrielle** *(a sparkly-eyed Fey with a too-large hat, entering the cafe)*:
‚ÄúRyn, darling. Why does your sign say *‚ÄòThe human is not a pet, do not name him‚Äô?‚Äù*

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(behind the counter, wiping a teacup aggressively)*:
*sighs* ‚ÄúBecause someone‚Äî*someone*‚Äîtried to name him. Called him ‚ÄòSquish‚Äô. Thought it was *adorable*. He climbed onto the chandelier and refused to come down until he was knighted.‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
‚Äú‚Ä¶Knighted? As in...?‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
‚ÄúFormal sword ceremony. Demanded a feather cape. Said his ‚Äòrogue subclass requires ceremonial validation‚Äô.‚Äù

**Zalrielle** *(delighted)*:
‚ÄúOhhh this sounds like a story. Spill.‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
‚ÄúDo I look like I have *time* for spilling? I‚Äôm still plucking moss out of the espresso wand from the ‚Äòbog milk latte‚Äô incident.‚Äù

**Zalrielle** *(pulls up a vine-swing stool)*:
‚ÄúI brought you moonberry croissants.‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(already opening the box)*:
‚Äú‚Ä¶Fine. But if I start twitching, throw a glamour blanket over me and pretend I‚Äôm furniture.‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
Deal.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(groans)*:
‚ÄúIt started three moon-cycles ago. I was reorganizing the illusion shelf‚Äîyes, the one where the books bite back if you mispronounce their titles‚Äîand I heard the door chime. I turned around expecting someone normal. A Pixie, maybe. A will-o‚Äô-wisp with a coffee addiction.‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
‚ÄúThere he was. *A human*. Just‚Ä¶ standing there.(*MENACINGLY*) Holding a notebook.  Staring at the scones like they‚Äôd insulted his ancestors.‚Äù*

**Zalrielle**:
‚ÄúWas he cute?‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
‚ÄúHe looked like a confused houseplant. But in that way humans have. Big eyes. Messy hair. The expression of someone who just woke up inside a dream‚Äîand also possibly on fire.‚Äù

**Zalrielle** *(cackles)*:
Awww.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(deadpan)*:
I tossed him a honey-drop. He *flinched*. Like I was offering him a poison dart.

**Zalrielle**:
Well, to be fair‚Ä¶

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
It was a *mildly* hallucinogenic honey-drop. He didn‚Äôt even eat it! Just started asking me questions. Like:

‚ÄúDo you charge souls for soup?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is the spoon whispering in Latin?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you legally allowed to grant wishes indoors?‚Äù

And my favorite:

‚ÄúWhat happens if a firstborn sacrifices you instead?‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
‚Ä¶Okay that one‚Äôs kind of clever.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
I chased him out with a broom made of memories. Thought that would be the end of it.

**Zalrielle**:
It was *not* the end, was it?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(muttering)*:
He came back the next day. THROUGH THE TEAPOT PORTAL. I hadn‚Äôt even opened it.

**Zalrielle**:
The one in the cupboard?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
Yes! He just *crawled* out of it! Covered in sugar cubes. Claimed he ‚Äúgot lost following the scent of forbidden jam.‚Äù And then he‚Äîhe *licked the wallpaper*.

**Zalrielle* *(choking on croissant)*:
Oh gods.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
He does this *thing*. Where he pretends I‚Äôm the strange one. I tell him to leave and he just squints at me like, ‚ÄúWait, are you *real* or symbolic?‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
Oh no.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(increasingly agitated)*:
I put up anti-human sigils. He *high-fived* one and said, ‚ÄúNice runes, but your perimeter wards are garbage.‚Äù THEN HE GAVE ME TIPS. As if I *asked*.

**Zalrielle**:
You‚Äôre sure he‚Äôs human?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
I checked. He bleeds ketchup.

**Zalrielle**:
Oh. Definitely human.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
I even tried to *reason* with him *once*. Sat him down, gave him tea (non-sentient), and told him: ‚ÄúYou need to stop breaking into my cafe. This is the Feywild. You're not supposed to *be* here.‚Äù

He looked me dead in the eye and said:
‚ÄúThen why do you have a loyalty card system?‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
Wait. Do you?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
Yes, but that‚Äôs *not* the point.

**Zalrielle** *(grinning)*:
This is amazing.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(head in hands)*:
He once rewired my illusion lights to flash ‚ÄúOpen For Chaos‚Äù. Told me it would ‚Äúincrease foot traffic among dimensionally curious raccoons.‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
What do you call him?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(grudgingly)*:
*‚ÄúChaos Lad.‚Äù*

**Zalrielle** *(beaming)"":
Perfect.

**Zalrielle**:
You should really write a book about him.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
I have. It‚Äôs under the ‚ÄúCursed Tomes‚Äù section.

**Zalrielle**:
What‚Äôs it called?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
*‚ÄúWild Human: A Field Guide to the Annoying, Endearing, and Chaotic.‚Äù Subtitled ‚ÄúHow To Remove Jam From Your Sigils.‚Äù*

**Zalrielle** *(laughing)*:
So what finally made you put the sign outside?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(dryly)*:
He started bringing friends.

**Zalrielle**:
*WHAT.*

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
Three other humans. All with backpacks. They said they were on a ‚Äúresearch expedition.‚Äù One of them tried to interview my pastries.

**Zalrielle**:
Did the pastries answer?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
Of course they did. But only in riddles.

**Zalrielle**:
Naturally.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
So I put up the sign.
Then another.
Then one in rhyme because apparently humans ignore prose.

**Zalrielle** *(reading off the mental list)*:

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pet the human.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt follow it into metaphorical woods.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDo not engage in philosophical debates. He will win, and you will cry.‚Äù*


‚Äú‚Ä¶Wait. He *wins debates*?‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
He has *TED Talks*. In his *back pocket*. I don‚Äôt know how. He once made an animated argument about why dragons should unionize.

**Zalrielle**:
‚Ä¶Okay that‚Äôs kind of brilliant.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(quietly)*:
He didn‚Äôt come last week.

**Zalrielle** *(sensing the shift)*:
Oh?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
The first day was peaceful. I made tea. Rearranged my gravity shelves. Even got through lunch without existential questions about fae ethics.
By the third day, I was *checking* the dimensional locks. Left the back gate open. You know. ‚ÄúBy accident.‚Äù Just in case.

**Zalrielle** *(gently teasing)*:
You missed him.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(grudgingly)*:
No. I missed the‚Ä¶ *chaos equilibrium*. Things were *too quiet*. Customers started making eye contact. I couldn‚Äôt handle it.

**Zalrielle**:
And?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(relieved)*:
He burst in last night through the chimney. Covered in leaves. Said:
‚ÄúI have returned! The curse is broken!‚Äù

**Zalrielle**:
He had a curse?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
A cold. He sneezed so hard he summoned a small squirrel army.

**Zalrielle** *(cackling)*:
And you just‚Ä¶ let him stay?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
I gave him a cup of ginger root stew and told him to sit quietly or I‚Äôd hex his shoelaces into venomous worms.

**Zalrielle**:
And did he?

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
He asked if the stew was ‚Äúemotionally vegan.‚Äù Then passed out in a sunbeam.

**Zalrielle** *(smiling warmly)*:
You‚Äôre fond of him.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(sighs, then chuckles)*:
He‚Äôs like a walking paradox. A clueless, stubborn, clever little storm. He doesn‚Äôt belong here, and yet‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like he makes the place more *real*. Somehow.

**Zalrielle**:
You know that‚Äôs very Fey of you.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira**:
What?

**Zalrielle**:
Keeping the thing you claim to hate most. Just to see what happens next.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(smirking)*:
Maybe. Or maybe I just like having someone around who treats me like a riddle instead of a threat.

**Zalrielle** *(nods sagely)*:
That‚Äôs very human of him.

**[Suddenly, the front door bursts open with a dramatic flourish. Chaos lad, slightly muddy, holding a suspiciously glowing rock, yells:]**

**Chaos lad**:
‚ÄúOkay! Hypothetically! If I ask you to turn me into a metaphysical concept, but like *part-time*, is there a form I have to fill out?!‚Äù

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(without missing a beat)*:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs laminated and stapled to the back of the dragon skull. Third shelf.‚Äù

**Chaos lad** *(offscreen)*:
‚ÄúTHANKS!‚Äù

**Zalrielle** *(grinning)*:
You‚Äôre doomed, you know.

**Ryn‚ÄôQira** *(smiling, finally, just a little)*:
Probably.
But at least I‚Äôm not bored.

**[BONUS SCENE]**: 

**Chaos Lad**: ""OKAY! If a metaphor punches me, is that considered an *Emotional Damage*?!""

 **Ryn'Qira**: ""Only if the metaphor has intent."" 

**Zalrielle** *(laughing)*: ""You're running a caf√©, Ryn. Not a reality support group."" 

**Ryn'Qira** *(fondly)*: ""Same thing, some days.""

for context, we‚Äôre both 24. the thing she describes me discussing with her is the fact that she feels pressured to go to college. initially in our relationship, i agreed with her family that she should - then, she put absolutely no effort towards it for two years and last week, i told her that it‚Äôs her life and i am no longer going to be part of that chorus of people in her life because i am in law school, currently working in a prosecutor‚Äôs office, and i have my own goals to fulfill. i also told her that her negativity towards anybody getting an adult education - and god forbid, enjoying it - rubs off on me and i can feel a lot of resentment for it. almost to the point where her actions - like fighting with me the night before all my finals, and not giving me space to study or rest, feels like sabotage because I‚Äôve worked hard for something she does not have right now. 

FFW to this exchange. She works at a coffee shop. She is mad because some high school seniors walked in and were proud of their achievements. They‚Äôre 18 years old. They should be happy for themselves - they are on the road to good things. It‚Äôs not their fault that my GF did not get through her freshman year - and even moreso that she never went back. She fixates on the social aspects - the parties, the drinking - shit that she has NEVER liked. It makes no sense to me. I know she explains that because she didn‚Äôt have it then (at 18, underage) she doesn‚Äôt want it at all now, but that‚Äôs bullshit in my opinion. Sometimes it just feels like anyone doing remotely well deserves to be dragged down - even me, on occasion - in her eyes.

I'm sitting on my ass doin nothin. All I do is scrolling, texting some of my friends I met online. 

I've controlled my scrolling pretty much but yk I've got like 3, 4 friends whom I text all day and one of em is my favourite and we've been friends for like 9 months (damnn I'm thinking bout it js now, it's been 9 months ü´† and I met her online lol) so I text her all day in insta and she's a typa girl who likes to talk w me for hours(not for hours) so I use insta to text her and few of my other friends too. So what I'm trying to say is that I use insta and I can't delete it easily and bcz of that I get distracted in it, my notifications of insta is off so I constantly check if someone texted me or not and if not I checkout my feed and I end up scrolling like 5 or 6 reels(pretty glad that I can stop after 6 reels lol).

So my daily routine is like, wake up open insta, text em, check tg for the gc waste some time there get back to reddit and post some comments which gets me KARMA ü§ë and I kinda respond to all the replies that I get, it gave m dopamine hits yk like realising that fact that I've been accepted or I made a good point I feel myself proud üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è.  Then it'll be time for having breakfast (gonna have it) and after that I'll make a coffee on my own. And then I again repeat the same process, open up insta, tg, reddit. 

What I likes to do is, I wanna take care of myself, I wanna do skin care, work on my body, read books, learn coding (learn a new skills) journaling and whatnot...

So I wanna change, I wanna cut off all the distractions I've got and I need some advice on skincare routine too. I'd appreciate if someone can drop some of your skincare routines which worked for you guys and tell me what your day looks like so that I can know and connect w peeps who are worser than me and I can help em and myself to improve ü§†, thanks a lot of reading üòÆ‚Äçüí®",3,1749094222.0,TeensofKerala,4,1.0,False

My body feels like a minefield that is just exploding. My period is 3 days late now, just waiting and waiting. My lipidema has ballooned out of control, I'm not even eating anymore, just some eggs and coffee and I'm still getting fatter and veins are bulging out all over me and hurt so much. It's all new and awful. My genitals are vaporized. I leak pee on myself all the time despite so much pelvic floor therapy. And I can't use the cream because I'm allergic to it. And as of yesterday my eyelashes are falling out, probably because I tried an eye serum literally once three weeks ago and it burnt the shit out of my entire eye sockets and now the skin is all floppy and crepey and the opthalmologist said I damaged my glands so my eyes don't make lubricant anymore. I've lost like half my hair in the past 2 years. I go to doctors and they won't even give me referrals. I can't sleep, if I'm lucky I sleep from 4am-9am. I went to the ER for extreme pelvic pain and they figured out I've got pelvic congestion syndrome (which explains why I've been in so much pain for 20+ years) but I am not going to get treatment for it apparently. My index finger knuckle has some kind of arthritis or something that puffs up big and red like a cartoon injury and the whole finger hurts randomly and then it fades away(mostly) again randomly. All of this just the past few months...

I am in hell, I am dying and I don't even know what to do to try to slow it down because ""hormones look normal"" and I don't have enough money for anything, but I don't even know what I would do if I could. Medical tourism? If this is really just me hurtling rapidly toward the end of my life, what am I supposed to do with the time left to me? I've been begging for help for years but things are happening so fast now. And I just keep bursting into tears (which is really painful because of my eye damage) because everything hurts so much and I'm scared and I don't have any help and no one believes me except Reddit. My body has betrayed me completely and I don't know what to do. 

It's really hard to see the humor in all of this when no one will even acknowledge what is happening to me. I feel like I must just be a really bad person or someone put a curse on me. I must have done something wrong. I want to make smart decisions but everything backfires. Making this post is probably going to rain down a fresh hell on me. 

I'm trying to do my best but it seems like reality is gone because nothing works the way it should anymore at all and I really just don't know what to do",12,1749094068.0,Perimenopause,0,1.0,False

Context: I am 20f, full time university and part time work in a fast paced environment always on my feet. My adhd is high inattentiveness and low-mid hyperactivity, i also struggle with both depression and anxiety and take pristiq for that which has worked for years. 

I was only recently diagnosed with ADHD and started 20mg of vyvanse 2 months ago. I felt great on the 20 mg but my psychiatrist recommended a higher dosage as the benefits I was receiving from the 20 mg were not ‚Äúas good‚Äù as they should be. I went up to 30mg and started taking it 4 days ago. I have worked everyday this week, finished 2 large essays for university and am now studying for final exams next week. Plus I usually have 1 cup of coffee a day. 

Since being on the 30mg I have accomplished lots of uni work, but in a general sense I feel so overwhelmed and the constant brain fog is so draining.  I feel anxious all day about no particular thing just a constant feeling of anxiety, i can‚Äôt hold conversations without changing the subject every 2 seconds or forgetting what I was just talking about. At work, I feel constantly rushed even when work is slow, I feel like I can‚Äôt relax and I have to be constantly doing so much at once. Two days ago I experienced a severe overload of anger, long story short i was working with an incompetent worker and it just set me off for the whole day. This co-worker left early at around 11am and I still carried the anger I felt into the night and just could not shake the feeling of frustration and overwhelm. I did not actually get angry at this person, but I could feel the anger in my body, and it was literally all I thought about all day. I did everything my psychologist has told me to do when i cant regulate my emotions but nothing has helped. There's also been some other symptoms, like forgetting tasks, being slightly anti-social, constantly tired etc. 

The 20 mg seemed to work fine but I did think it could‚Äôve been better, but now the 30 mg I feel like has completely rocked me. I have read old posts on this group about dosage but couldn't find much that related. I also drink lots of water, cut out citrus and make sure I eat 30g of protein each morning. 

Sorry for the long rant just hoping someone could help/share their experience before I can get in with my doctor. Thanks in advance ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**Scene 1**

**INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - MORNING (THREE WEEKS AGO)**

SOUND of distant city hum

The apartment, 1413, is a testament to curated detachment. Polished concrete floors, minimalist furniture with razor-sharp edges, a single, oversized abstract painting on the wall that seems to hum with suppressed energy. Sunlight, when it deigned to visit, pours through the expansive, uncurtained windows, illuminating dust motes in a slow, celestial dance. No fire escape beckons, no balcony offers a precarious perch; just glass, steel, and the sprawling, indifferent city beyond. It is a stylish cage, immaculate and silent, reflecting back to Amelia a life lived in exquisite, almost painful, order.

Amelia‚Äôs days unfold with the precision of a clockwork mechanism, each hour a cog in the monotonous wheel of her solitude. Morning begins not with an alarm's vulgar shriek, but with the subtle shift in the ambient light.

AMELIA (20s-30s) rises from her bed, the faded pink robe, a garment of plush decay, sighing around her. Its belt, a casualty of some long-lost laundry cycle, had vanished into the ether years ago, leaving the fabric to hang open, a silent testament to its abandonment. Beneath this flimsy shroud, the delicate lacework of her panties, a sliver of dark silk against her pale flesh, offers the only true embrace.

She moves to the kitchen with the quiet grace of a specter.

AMELIA : (Muttering to herself, a quiet ritual) > Another day, another cycle. The beautiful, predictable grind.

The ritual of coffee-making is her first prayer. The rhythmic thrum of the grinder pulverizing dark, fragrant beans, the delicate gurgle of the water as it drips through the filter, each drop a tiny measure of time. The bitter aroma fills the air, a fleeting, potent warmth in the cool, still apartment.

She sits at her crystalline glass desk, the laptop her portal, its screen a blinding rectangle of light against the muted tones of her living space. As a finance manager, her dominion is the monochromatic ballet of digits. Today, it‚Äôs the forensic dissection of quarterly earnings, the ruthless hunt for anomalies in sprawling datasets. Her fingers, nimble and precise, dance across the keyboard, coaxing secrets from columns of figures, her brow furrowed in a concentration so absolute it borders on trance. The low, incessant hum of the machine is the day‚Äôs constant companion, broken only by the almost inaudible sigh she might release as a particularly stubborn formula yielded to her will. Her gaze, unwavering, consumes the glowing text, the world beyond the screen‚Äîthe actual, breathing city‚Äîa distant, forgotten tableau.

AMELIA : (Whispering to the screen) > There you are, you little anomaly. Nowhere to hide.

Lunch, an act of pure sustenance, is consumed at the desk, a utilitarian salad or a pre-packaged meal, its plastic tray a sterile island in the sea of her work. The afternoon bleeds into the evening with seamless, uneventful progression. Virtual meetings, disembodied voices on a flat screen, offer no true communion. Her contributions are always measured, her tone neutral, her camera steadfastly off. She prefers the disembodied anonymity, a voice without a face, a mind without a body in the echoing void of digital space. The faces of her colleagues, glimpsed briefly in the grid, seem like inhabitants of a parallel dimension, their triumphs and anxieties mere flickering pixels.

As the light outside softens, fading from the sharp clarity of day to the melancholic glow of twilight, a subtle unease begins to stir. The silence in her apartment, once a comfort, now begins to feel less like peace and more like an expansive, encroaching vacuum.

**INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - EVENING (THREE WEEKS AGO)**

The evening's true ceremony, the ablution, begins with the delicate dance of scented candlelight. The tiny flames, wavering like trapped spirits, cast dancing shadows across the pristine white tiles of her bathroom.

Amelia looks at her reflection in the mirror, her face a composition of soft, unremarkable features, a canvas too often left unpainted by the brush of strong emotion. Yet, amidst this landscape of the ordinary, two startling prominences assert themselves: her breasts. Naturally ample, their perky uplift defies the gentle tyranny of gravity, crowned by areolas of a tender pink, puffed like miniature souffl√©s, from which, in an exquisite inversion, her nipples recede, drawing inward, secrets whispered only to the soft confines of her brassiere, or to the cool caress of the air when the robe slipped aside. Her skin, from nape to ankle, thigh to abdomen, is a landscape meticulously denuded, shorn bald, a velvet-smooth expanse maintained with an almost surgical devotion.

AMELIA : (To her reflection, a soft sigh) > Still here. Still perfect.

She fills the deep porcelain tub, the rush of water a fleeting, thunderous roar in the quiet. Steam, thick and fragrant, rises to caress her face, momentarily obscuring her reflection in the mirror, transforming the harsh lines of reality into a soft-focus dream.

Sinking into the scalding embrace of the water, her body exhales, the day's tensions dissolving into the shimmering heat. She closes her eyes, letting the warmth cocoon her.

AMELIA : (A breathy whisper) > This is my sanctuary. The only place where the edges soften.

Then, the meticulous ritual of the blade. The razor, a gleaming sliver of surgical steel, is selected with reverence. Lathering her legs, she watches the pristine white foam bloom against her skin, then with a practiced hand, draws the scalpel-keen edge upwards. Each stroke is precise, deliberate, stripping away the invisible down, leaving behind a surface of velvet-smoothness, sensitive to the slightest breath of air.

This same meticulousness extends to the most intimate geography of her body. With a quiet breath, she applies the foam to her pubis, the white cloud a stark contrast to the dark lace she had discarded. The razor follows, carving a path through the softest of hairs, leaving no trace, no shadow. It is an act of extreme privacy, a precise self-sculpting for an audience of one, a flawless, hairless expanse maintained with the precision of a votary.

AMELIA : (A low murmur) > Clean. Controlled. Perfect.

Dripping and flushed, she emerges from the bath, swathing herself in a large, thirsty towel, before returning to the familiar, comforting disarray of her open robe and the fresh lace of her panties.

Dinner, a solitary affair, is consumed in the hushed elegance of her dining nook ‚Äì perhaps a simple pasta, its sauce a vibrant stain on the white ceramic, or a medley of roasted vegetables. Always, a book lies open beside her plate, a portal to a life beyond her own. She devours narratives of impossible love, cosmic horrors, or intricate mysteries, vicariously experiencing the passions and terrors denied to her own existence.

AMELIA : (Softly, to the open book) > If only life could be so‚Ä¶ vibrant. So dangerous.

Later, the television flickers to life, its blue light a cold, flickering companion in the deepening gloom. She scrolls through an endless parade of streaming options, never quite settling, never quite engaged. The fabricated dramas, the curated emotions, feel both too distant and too close, a mirror reflecting a life she is not living.

Eventually, the quiet, persistent thrum of exhaustion guides her to her bedroom, the city lights outside her window twinkling like a scattered handful of indifferent diamonds. Sleep is often a shallow thing, her mind occasionally looping back to the day's spreadsheets, or drifting into vague, unformed yearnings that dissipate with the first hint of morning light.

**INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (THREE WEEKS AGO)**

SOUND of distant city hum

The rap on the door, sudden and insistent, tears through the uncanny quiet of the evening. It is a little past ten, the city a muted, distant hum. Amelia, half-submerged in the plush cushions of her sofa, a well-worn paperback resting open on her bared thigh, freezes. Her breath catches, a small, painful gasp in her throat. No one knocks. Not truly.

Then, again, a lighter, more questioning tap.

SARAH : Amelia? It's Sarah from 14B. Are you alright? We haven't seen you around much lately.

Sarah. Always Sarah, the building's self-appointed conscience, a woman whose boundless, effervescent sociability is a constant, gentle pressure against Amelia's carefully erected walls. Amelia‚Äôs fingers tighten on the spine of her book, the thin pages crinkling. The robe, as if sensing the intrusion, slips further open, revealing more of the dark lace.

AMELIA : (Voice a shade too bright, too quick, brittle) > Yes, Sarah, I'm perfectly fine! Just a bit under the weather. Thank you for checking, though!

She stands there, rigid, listening. A soft sigh, the whisper of fabric, the faint scuff of shoes against the carpet, then silence. Sarah had receded, a tide ebbing from her shores. Amelia releases the breath she‚Äôd held, a shaky exhalation that tasted of dust and unspoken dread. She remains, suspended, her hand hovering over the doorknob, a barrier unbreached. The loneliness, a cold, familiar weight, settles back into her bones, a heavy cloak in the quiet, stylish, and eternally solitary chamber of her apartment. The door, a simple slab of wood, feels as impenetrable as a vault.

**Scene 2**

**MONTAGE - THREE WEEKS LATER**

FADE IN:

**INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY**

Three weeks pass. Three weeks of deepening the grotesque stain emanating from apartment 1413. It commenced as a phantom whisper on the prevailing currents of the building's air conditioning, a scent so faint it was dismissed, waved away as the residue of a forgotten takeaway, a distant plumbing issue, or the spectral breath of urban grime clinging to the ventilation shafts.

SOUND of air conditioning hum, distorted, growing in intensity

But as the days accumulated, stitching themselves into a ragged tapestry of time, the whisper grew into a murmur, then a low hum, and finally, a guttural, undeniable presence that seemed to cling to the very air. It is a smell that defies easy categorization, a complex blasphemy against the senses. Not merely the cloying sweetness of decay, nor the sharp tang of something putrefying, nor even the acrid bite of chemicals. It possesses a deeper resonance, a metallic undertone, like blood long dried on forgotten surgical tools, laced with the sickly, sweet perfume of lilies rotting in standing water, and something else, something profoundly animal and profound, hinting at flesh undone, at boundaries breached, at a hidden corruption blooming behind a sealed door.

The residents of the fourteenth floor, accustomed to the easy currents of communal existence ‚Äì the borrowed cup of sugar, the impromptu hallway chat, the shared lament about the rising cost of utilities ‚Äì find their social graces curdling. Sarah from 14B, whose initial pleasantry had been so readily rebuffed by Amelia‚Äôs disembodied voice, now finds her inquiries laced with a mounting dread that tightens her throat.

She taps on Amelia‚Äôs door, her knuckles brushing against the smooth, unyielding wood.

SARAH : (Voice thin with anxiety) > Amelia? Are you really alright? That smell‚Ä¶ it's getting rather strong, dear. Are you sure you don't need anything? I could pick something up for you.

From within, always the same unblemished voice, calm as still water over pebbles, a voice that never seems to crack or waver.

AMELIA : I'm fine, Sarah. Just‚Ä¶ a little indisposed. Thank you for your concern.

No click of a lock, no reassuring creak of hinges, no comforting crack in the door, no glimpse of Amelia. Just the flat, uninflected reassurance, made monstrous by the evolving stench that coils from beneath the door, tasting of something utterly wrong.

And it isn't just the smell. A new, unsettling malaise has begun to infest the floor, a creeping pestilence of the senses. The lights in the hallway, once a steady, reassuring glow, begin to flicker erratically, sometimes dimming to a sickly orange pulse, sometimes snapping off entirely, plunging the corridor into an unnerving, transient darkness that feels more like a tangible presence than a mere absence of light.

SOUND of flickering lights, then darkness

Neighbors jump, startled, then glance nervously at 1413, as if the very darkness, the very power drain, emanated from within its sealed walls.

Then came the water. Or what appeared to be water. A strange, viscous blackness, thick as crude oil, begins to pool sporadically in the indentations of the polished concrete floor. It appears without warning, seemingly from nowhere, a glistening, opaque stain that defies logic. It has no discernible source; no burst pipes, no overflowing sinks could be traced back to its sudden appearance. It simply is.

One morning, MR. HENDERSON, the building manager, finds a spreading slick outside apartment 1409, a few doors down from Amelia's. He kneels, his finger tentative, and touches the viscous liquid. It is cold, unnaturally so, and left a faint, disturbing oily residue on his skin that wouldn't wash off easily, clinging like a shroud. The building's maintenance staff scoured the pipes, checked every utility closet, but the source remained elusive, a dark, weeping mystery that clung to the floor like a spreading bruise on the building's very soul.

The smell and the black water, the flickering lights, become an unholy trinity of dread, slowly tightening their grip on the residents of the fourteenth floor, twisting their anxieties into open fear.

**INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR AREA - DAY**

In the small, awkward gatherings by the elevator, the theories begin to bloom, wild and desperate.

MR. GOLDBERG  (60s, pale): It's a burst pipe, I tell you! (Trying to project practicality) > Must be some kind of toxic mold growing in there. That's why she won't open the door. Afraid of the spores.

MRS. RODRIGUEZ  (50s, clutching purse tighter): Mold doesn't smell like that, Arthur. That's‚Ä¶ that's like something dead. Like a whole animal. Or worse.

Her eyes flicker towards 1413, a morbid fascination warring with outright terror.

DAVID (30s), Amelia‚Äôs direct neighbor across the hall, has grown noticeably gaunt, the constant presence of the stench eroding his appetite and his peace.

DAVID : What kind of person changes their locks when they're 'a little indisposed' and their apartment is leaking‚Ä¶ that?

He gestures vaguely at a fresh, inky stain near the communal recycling bins, its edges strangely precise, like a graphic design.

Sarah, her voice tight with suppressed hysteria, wrings her hands.

SARAH : But she said she was fine! Every time! So calm. It's not right. And the lights‚Ä¶ it's like the whole floor is cursed. My cat won't even go near her door anymore. Just hisses at it.

YOUNG WOMAN : Maybe she's‚Ä¶ gone. And‚Ä¶ whatever she had in there‚Ä¶ started to decompose.

This theory, whispered in varying degrees of horror, is the one that truly settles, a cold, heavy stone in their stomachs. But if she was gone, then who was answering? The calm, even voice from behind the door becomes the central, most chilling mystery. Was it a recording? A trick of the air? Or something else entirely? The black water and the flickering lights seem to confirm their darkest imaginings, hinting at something beyond the mundane, a slow, invisible transformation within Amelia's sealed world.

The smell, now a monstrous, palpable entity, has permeated the entire building. It clings to clothes, seeps into hair, and tastes metallic on the tongue, a constant, sickening reminder that invades their private lives. Finally, the collective unease, sharp as a sliver of glass, prompts a formal, desperate call to the building manager, a plea for intervention that carries the weight of their sanity.

**Scene 3**

**INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT**

Mr. Henderson, a man whose placid demeanor usually only ruffled when rent was late, arrives with his master key, a ring of glinting steel that promised access to every private world within his domain. He taps on 1413, a brisk, confident rhythm, hoping to project an air of calm authority that he is rapidly losing.

MR. HENDERSON : Ms. Finch? It's Mr. Henderson, the building manager. We've had a few‚Ä¶ concerns, some rather unusual reports. Just a quick wellness check, if you please.

Silence, thick and expectant, descends. Then, that calm, unsettling voice, as unblemished as a fresh-dug grave.

AMELIA : I assure you, Mr. Henderson, all is well. There is no need for alarm. My‚Ä¶ indisposition is simply taking a little longer to pass.

Henderson frowns, his nostrils flaring involuntarily at the overpowering stench that now seems to emanate directly from the door, a foul breath from beneath the crack, moist and heavy. He inserts his master key, twisting the brass with a confident snap. It turns freely, without purchase, spinning uselessly in the lock. He tried again, jiggling, rattling, forcing. Nothing.

A chill, colder than any air conditioning, snaked up his spine. Amelia Finch had changed the locks. A defiant, solitary act that spoke volumes of her hermetic will, a sudden, brutal severing of her last tangible link to the outside world, a barrier raised against a world she had decided to abandon.

**INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS**

The police arrive swiftly, two uniformed OFFICERS, their faces initially etched with the weary patience of routine calls, an almost condescending pity for the hysterical neighbors. They knock, harder, announcing their presence with official, unyielding authority.

LEAD OFFICER : Police! Open the door, please, Ms. Finch! We have received reports of a strong odor and other‚Ä¶ unusual occurrences.

Again, the voice, unchanged, unperturbed by the blare of their presence, an impossible calm.

AMELIA : There is no need for your presence, officers. I am quite alright. Please leave me to my privacy.

A frustrated sigh escapes the Lead Officer, his jaw tightening. They confer briefly, then the first officer, a burly man whose bulk seemed to absorb the hallway's oppressive atmosphere, raises a heavy boot, aiming for the plate beside the knob. The impact is a dull, shattering BOOM that echoes down the hallway, rattling the teeth of unseen residents behind their own doors. Yet, the door to 1413 held. Unyielding. A second kick, a third, each one a desperate, failing assault against the silence within. The wood groaned, the frame shuddered, splinters flying, but the door, a golem of wood and steel, remained an impenetrable maw. It is as though the very air behind it had solidified, bracing it against their invasion, infused with an unseen, unholy resolve.

The LOCKSMITH, summoned from his quiet domesticity, arrives, his tools clinking in a canvas bag, a mundane counterpoint to the escalating horror. He is a small, meticulous man, accustomed to defiant mechanisms, but even he seems to shrink in the presence of the burgeoning stench, his eyes watering. He works slowly, deliberately, the small scraping and clicking sounds of his instruments a grotesque counterpoint to the pervasive, fetid perfume emanating from the door. Minutes stretched into an eternity, each tick of his watch a measure of escalating dread. Sweat beaded on his brow, blurring his vision, the task proving far more obstinate than any he had encountered in recent memory. It is as if the very lock had a will of its own, imbued with a malignant life force, refusing to yield to the prying metal, a desperate resistance to exposure, to the intrusion of the mundane world into whatever horrific sanctity lay beyond.

The air, thick with the unholy scent, seems to grow heavier, pressing in on them.

And then, with a final, protesting GROAN of tortured metal, a sound like a cry of surrender from something unwillingly broken, the mechanism yielded. A soft, wet CLICK, almost audible over the oppressive silence. The door, which had seemed so impossibly bound, stood unlocked.

The Lead Officer took a deep, fortifying breath, a grim set to his jaw, and placed his hand on the cold doorknob. He turned it, slowly, the dread in the hallway thick enough to taste, a sour, metallic tang on the tongue.

The door swung inward.

**Scene 4**

**INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - DINING NOOK - NIGHT (THREE WEEKS AGO - THE FINAL NIGHT)**

SOUND of distant city hum

Hours before the locksmith‚Äôs tools finally cracked the defiant shell of 1413, Amelia Finch had been engaged in the quiet sacrament of her evening meal. Pasta, a simple and unchallenging dish, lay congealed on her plate, a testament to her waning appetite. Her well-worn paperback, a tale of ancient, forgotten horrors, lay open beside her, its pages soft beneath her fingertips. The plush robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a faint shadow against her skin. The only sounds were the distant, anonymous hum of the city, the soft rustle of the turning page, and the occasional clink of her fork against ceramic. Her plain face, usually a mask of mild indifference, was softened by the low glow of the reading lamp, revealing the subtle hollows beneath her cheekbones, the slight puffiness around her inverted nipples that sometimes appeared when she was relaxed. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually a smooth, cool expanse, was subtly flushed from the warmth of the meal and the quiet comfort of her solitary ritual.

Amelia takes a bite of the pasta. She sighs contentedly.

AMELIA : (To herself, a wistful whisper) > Another life. Not this one. Always more interesting in the pages.

Then, the world outside her meticulous routine exploded.

SOUND of splintering wood, metal shriek ‚Äì LOUDER, more VIOLENT

With a sound like thunder, the door to her apartment‚Äîthat very door now being forced open by the police‚Äîburst inward from its frame. Wood splintered, metal shrieked, and a gust of foul, cold air, laden with the stench of something unspeakably wrong, assaulted her.

Amelia gasped, her book scattering to the polished floor, a sudden, sharp CLATTER against the silence. Framed against the shattered entryway stood a FIGURE, stark and terrible: a man cloaked in absolute black, every inch of his form swallowed by dark fabric, his face obliterated by the blank, malevolent void of a black ski mask. In his hand, he held a bludgeon, a heavy, crude club, its surface rough and dark, glinting wetly in the faint light that pierced the doorway.

Terror, a cold, sharp blade, pierced through Amelia's habitual lethargy. It was a sensation so raw, so alien, that it jolted her from her quiet drone, stripping away the layers of monotonous comfort and revealing the trembling animal beneath. Her plain face contorted, a mask of pure, uncomprehending fear, her eyes wide, showing too much white.

She SCREAMED, a raw, choked sound torn from a throat unused to such utterance, a sound that grated in the sudden, abyssal silence, and scrambled from the table, overturning her chair in a desperate scramble. The crash of ceramic and wood was swallowed by the sudden, guttural ROAR of her attacker, a sound of pure, bestial hunger.

He moved with a horrifying speed, a dark blur against the fading light of the hallway, a creature of pure, unadulterated intent, a shadow given terrible form. The first blow was aimed at her head, a whistling descent that she barely ducked, the wind of its passage tearing at her hair, a chilling caress of imminent violence. It struck the wall behind her with a sickening THUD, leaving a deep gouge, a wound in the very fabric of her home, a testament to the brute force unleashed.

\&lt;center> AMELIA  \&lt;/center> > (Voice thin, useless, utterly inadequate) > No!

He came at her again, relentless, a predator claiming its due. Her legs, usually so languid, pumped with a sudden, desperate energy she hadn't known she possessed, fueled by a primal need to survive. She fled, tripping over the scattered remnants of her dinner, a desperate, instinctive flight, a flight of pure, unthinking survival. The apartment, once her sanctuary, her ordered, quiet refuge, became a labyrinth of impending doom, each familiar object transformed into a treacherous obstacle.

As she stumbled and scrambled, her body a frantic, uncoordinated mess of limbs, the plush robe, already loose and unbelted, snagged on the overturned chair. With a tearing sound, a fabric cry of surrender, it ripped free from her shoulder, falling away in a heap on the polished floor, a discarded skin, leaving her utterly exposed.

Now, she ran in nothing but her lace panties, her body a pale, desperate flash against the deepening shadows of her home. Her natural, perky breasts, freed from the slight restraint of the robe, swung wildly with each panicked stride, two pale, bobbing targets, visibly jiggling and bouncing, pulling at the skin, against the gloom. The inverted nipples, once hidden secrets, were now exposed to the cold, predatory air, shriveling in the sudden, agonizing terror, like eyes retracting from a monstrous vision. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually so smooth and cool, was now slick with a sheen of desperate sweat, prickled with gooseflesh.

She scrambled past the crystalline glass desk, her hand tearing at the sparse hair on her head, her fingers clamping, pulling, as if to rip the terror from her skull, past the inert laptop that had once anchored her days, now a silent, impotent observer of her final moments. She ran for the bathroom, the only true refuge, a small, enclosed space of porcelain and tile that promised, foolishly, escape from the nightmare that pursued her.

She slammed the bathroom door shut behind her, fumbling for the lock, her fingers slick with terror, desperately trying to find purchase on the smooth metal, her nails scraping against the cold brass. The wood groaned under the impact of his body, a desperate, shuddering protest, but it held, for a blessed, agonizing moment.

She turned, her bare back pressed against the cold tiles, eyes wide, breath ragged, staring at the gleaming white bathtub. It was a porcelain maw, waiting, its clean lines mocking the chaos that had erupted, a pristine basin ready to receive her broken form.

The door splintered inward, ripped from its hinges by the force of his relentless entry, wood tearing with a sound like dying breath. He filled the doorway, a monstrous shadow, his form distorted by the dark fabric, the crude club raised high, silhouetted against the dim light of the hall, a cruel parody of an executioner.

Amelia SCREAMED again, a sound that tore from her lungs, pure, unadulterated horror, a final, primal cry of defiance, a desperate animal sound. She stumbled backward, tripping over her own feet, her legs tangling, falling heavily into the tub, the cold porcelain shocking her exposed skin, a chilling premonition of her tomb. Her body slumped, a broken doll, the lace of her panties a stark contrast against the white ceramic.

He was upon her instantly, a dark, heavy weight, a living shadow descending. The club descended.

The first blow struck her chest, directly between her breasts, a sickening CRACK that echoed in the small, enclosed space, stealing her breath. A blinding agony bloomed, fiery and absolute, radiating outwards from her sternum, a burst of searing pain that momentarily eclipsed all other sensation. She choked, a strangled cry escaping her lips, her body convulsing, her breasts, now bruised and mottled, still trembled with the force of the impact, collapsing inward.

The second blow landed on her ribcage, a dull, crushing impact that drove the remaining air from her lungs, forcing a ragged wheeze from her lips. She could feel the sharp edges of bone grating, tearing, a hideous symphony of destruction beneath her own skin. A hot, wet gush erupted in her mouth, metallic and coppery. Blood. It overflowed her lips, a crimson testament to the violation, running down her chin and neck.

The club rose and fell again, and again, a terrible, rhythmic punctuation to her dying gasps. Her head lolled, her vision blurring, the blank black ski mask above her swimming in a crimson haze, a swirling vortex of red and black. She felt a searing impact on her skull, then another, a deafening drumbeat of bone against blunt force, each one a final, annihilating declaration, crushing her very thoughts. Her limbs spasmodically, her body becoming a broken puppet, twitching, convulsing, no longer under her command.

Blood blossomed like a terrible, dark flower around her, painting the pristine white of the tub in grotesque new hues, a tableau of crimson horror. Her screams were reduced to a gurgling wheeze, then silence, a silence more profound than any she had known.

The blows continued, each one a final, annihilating declaration, long after the life had drained from her eyes, leaving her a broken, pulpy mass, forever entangled with the cold, gleaming porcelain. He stood over her, a dark monument to destruction, his silhouette filling the doorway, then turned and vanished back into the night, leaving the broken door, the shattered life, and the emerging, monstrous stillness.

**Scene 5**

**INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - DAY (PRESENT)**

The door swung inward with a faint, final CLICK, revealing the interior of apartment 1413. The three men‚Äîthe two officers and Mr. Henderson‚Äîare immediately assaulted by the full, unfiltered force of the smell. It is no longer a pervasive undercurrent; it is a physical blow, thick and choking, like breathing putrefied velvet. It cloyed at the back of their throats, burned their nostrils, and immediately settled in their stomachs, threatening to revolt. The air inside seemed heavier, stagnant, a tangible weight on their lungs.

The apartment itself is a tableau of interrupted existence, now long past. Dust motes, thick as velvet, dance in the shafts of light that pierced the gloom, illuminated by the officers' flashlights. The minimalist elegance from Amelia‚Äôs living photographs had devolved into a grim, unholy disarray.

On the glass dining table, two plates sit, one with the fossilized remains of what might have been pasta, now a dark, crusted mass, mottled with grey and green fungi. Beside it, a single, overturned chair lay sprawled, a broken sentinel guarding the decay. A well-worn paperback, its spine cracked, lay open on the polished concrete floor beside it, its pages yellowed and warped, a silent witness to a scene of forgotten terror. Every surface is filmed with a thin, almost oily layer of grime, and the silence, absolute and profound, pressed in on them, far heavier than any sound.

The officers, grim-faced, moved slowly, their flashlights cutting swathes through the oppressive atmosphere. They follow the source of the stench, which intensifies with each step, growing from an overpowering reek to a nauseating, undeniable assault. The black, viscous liquid, which had puzzled the building staff in the hallway, was now plainly visible as faint, dried trails on the polished concrete, leading directly towards the bathroom.

The bathroom door hung awkwardly from a single hinge, its wood splintered, a jagged, gaping wound in the otherwise pristine wall. The air in here is a noxious miasma, a concentrated distillation of the foulness from outside.

The officer in the lead raises his flashlight, its beam cutting through the oppressive darkness, then he lowered it slowly, revealing the scene within.

The bathtub.

Amelia Finch lay within it, a grotesque parody of repose. Her body, or what remained of it, was a shriveled, blackened husk, reduced by the merciless march of time and decomposition. The once-plush robe was indistinguishable from the matted, dark mass that had once been her hair, clinging to the skeletal remains of her head. The delicate lace panties were gone, consumed by the relentless process. Her large, perky breasts are now flat, shrunken pouches of desiccated flesh, the nipples sunken into a dark, leathery areola, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding decay. The skin, meticulously shaved in life, was now taut and stretched over the sharp angles of bone, a leathery mummy. A dark, dried pool of viscous fluid, almost black, adhered to the bottom of the tub, staining the porcelain a permanent, unholy hue. It was not merely the smell of death, but the profound silence of a body long abandoned, dissolving back into the earth from which it came.

One of the officers GAGS, clamping a hand over his mouth. The other, the Lead Officer, simply stares, his face ashen beneath the harsh beam of his flashlight. The scene spoke volumes of a terror unheeded, a death unmourned, and a life consumed by the very solitude it had embraced. This was not a fresh corpse; this was a relic of suffering.

The police pathologist, called moments later, would confirm their silent horror: Amelia Finch had been dead for at least two months.

And then, the questions began to bloom, sharp and insidious, in the minds of the officers. How? How had the killer entered this sealed tomb? The front door, now hanging by a single hinge, had been secured not only by the changed mortise lock, but by a series of heavy-duty, manual deadbolts and chain locks, all engaged from the inside. The locksmith had struggled mightily, attesting to their formidable security.

There was no fire escape, no precarious external staircase leading to the fourteenth floor. The apartment building stood alone, no other structure close enough for a jump or a precarious traverse. And the windows‚Äîsleek, modern, and expansive‚Äîwere immovably sealed, designed for insulation and climate control, offering no egress, no crack to the outside world.

The officers exchange baffled glances, their expressions shifting from grim discovery to profound unease. The killer had vanished without a trace, leaving behind a locked, impenetrable fortress, a perfect, horrifying enigma. It was as if the apartment itself had opened its maw to devour its victim, then sealed itself shut, leaving only the stench as a mocking testament to the horror within. The ordinary laws of ingress and egress seemed to have been utterly, irrevocably violated.

With a shared, unspoken understanding of the impossible, the officers retreated from the apartment's reeking interior. They returned with tools, not for investigation, but for containment. Heavy sheets of plywood were nailed across the broken door frame, crude planks of wood sealing the secrets within.

LEAD OFFICER:  (Muttering to himself, hollow) > Forensics will handle it. Until then, nobody goes in. Nobody comes out.

The last nail hammered home, a brutal, final CLANG, sealing the mysteries of 1413 behind a raw, wooden barrier.

**INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

SOUND of distant city hum

Meanwhile, Amelia Finch sat on her plush, minimalist couch. The reading lamp cast a warm, intimate glow over her. The faded pink robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a soft murmur against her skin, revealing the delicate curve of her upper thigh. On her lap, a plate of pasta, steaming gently, sat beside a well-worn paperback. She took a slow, deliberate bite, savoring the taste, her gaze fixed on the page, utterly absorbed in the narrative. The quiet hum of the city was a distant, comforting drone, a familiar lullaby. She was alone, in her stylish apartment, in the exquisite, terrifying solitude she had always craved. The world outside, its horrors and its mysteries, was a million miles away, a faint, forgotten echo.

This year has been some of the worst experiences I've had with food trucks in my entire life. I was so excited to CCE because I consider myself to be quite the foodie- and having lived in a few other cities through my travels, and having lived here in Denver for about a decade- I know there are some solid trucks out there and have grown quite the passion for food trucks. I know Denver isn't particularly known for its food truck scene, but I have been to a few really solid ones around the city.

I tried 4 trucks this year:

Astro Coffee Van: This is the only truck I would say was ""good"". A little on the pricey side, but its hard to mess up coffee drinks. They have good variety, and their espresso tastes decent. Not disappointing, worth a try.

Papa Friets: Best described as ""fine"". Tried the bratwurst, the brat itself was flavorless- seems like a really low quality brat, but the toppings were pretty good. Overall, wouldn't say no to the truck again if it was somewhere and I wanted a quick, simple bite.

Mukja: Disappointing. I've heard so much about this truck, and seen it so many times, but never had the chance to try it because either I wasn't hungry, or I didn't feel like waiting. This is hailed as an award winner. I tried the popcorn chicken (TTPC) meal and fries... over fried, stringy, and tasted like old oil, the seasoning was fine but a bit too salty- and I am a salt lover, overall dry and not worthy of a recommendation. The portion size was at least decent.

Cheese Love Grill: I hate to say it, this is the one that probably has turned me off trying any more trucks at CCE this year. If I had to pick one word to describe my meal- it would be ""DISGUSTING"" in all caps. I ordered the Philly cheese, hold the peppers. Let me tell you this was not only the worst food truck food I've eaten in my entire life- it is possibly the worst thing I've eaten that wasn't obviously spoiled in my life- and I served in the Navy for 8 years. The roll was soft and mushy, similar texture to pure white bread, not toasted or grilled at all, no crust.  The ""meat"" was **gray**. It was obviously microwaved chopped meat. I say meat because it didn't taste like steak, it tasted like salt and had literally zero other flavor. The mushrooms were obviously canned mushrooms, and they were not grilled at all- they weren't even warm. soggy, wet, giant raw canned mushroom slices slapped on top of the meat. And then the cheese...

I originally grew up in the Philly area, and I am no stranger to cheese sauce cheese steaks- I know they are not for everyone, but I always had an affinity for them. I also accept that not all cheese steaks are ""authentic"" and I have different expectations for cheese steaks outside the Philly area. This was not it. The cheese was slightly warmer than the air outside today- so the cheese was probably around 70 degrees. It was also obviously the lowest quality crap bulk unflavored nacho cheese sauce. My sandwich was yellow slathered on gray slimy mushrooms laid upon gray saltmeat, stuffed into soft white bread served in a watery topless to go container. I cannot stress enough how bad it was. My sincerest apologies to the owner of this truck, but I feel it is incredibly important to not charge $15+ for what has got to be $3 worth of ingredients- all of which was microwaved slightly- likely an hour prior. I took two bites, and threw the rest in the garbage having actually ruined my appetite for the rest of the day, for dinner I had a few pieces of broccoli and hummus because this damn sandwich is still living rent free in my head. I should have known something was wrong when my order was ready not even 2 minutes after I placed it.

To me- it seems some of these trucks may be struggling with demand. Maybe they aren't used to being so busy, and they are constantly rushing- and quality is lacking because of it.  CCE has been quite busy while I'm there.",8,1749093393.0,denverfood,4,0.79,False
1l3oz87,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_wuance_moore/comments/1l3oz87/why/,Why,"The way you shyly tried to ask whether I wanted to go out with you to try street foods. We could never go with that plan as the shop shut downed. But you offered to cook for me and send it over. Did I invite myself over when I suggested I could come over instead? You seemed happy in my presence. Though I got mixed signals that night, but you treated me like my mom would, by pestering me with all the food you made. I‚Äôve never felt that kind of love from someone, but I‚Äôm never going to be sure whether you were feeling the same tension as I was feeling. 

But when I invited you to hangout over coffee, you declined and rejected me, you wanted to know whether it was casual or a date, I got spooked maybe I crossed a line, a tried to hint that I liked you but at the same time keep this casual at first. Your rejection felt shocking and I was betrayed by my own mind and heart thinking there was something. As days went by, I thought you would distance yourself from me, but you still trust me more than others around and kept close and afar at the same time. I don‚Äôt know what you want from me, but I am clear about what I feel for you. You are maybe talking to someone else that you don‚Äôt have space for me in your life, maybe I‚Äôm not worthy enough, maybe I‚Äôm not enough. These days when you talk to me, there‚Äôs this look in your face of discontent and happiness at the same time. Last day you saw me heading towards to the pantry, I genuinely came to fill my coffee mug, but you came to fill glass of water, and as you said, you do that as an excuse to come to the pantry, and so you did to talk with me. God I never imagined I would fumble on someone like you so hard, what started as liking, and doubts whether I should do this with you, has turned into a one sided distant love. 

For what it was worth, I really did cherish every moment with you when I look back, even if it was surface level, you tried opening up to me about your vulnerable side, and I listened, so did I with you, you did listen. Everytime I look into your eyes I feel peace, like trying to see what‚Äôs beyond the horizon of a shoreline, and all you see is waves till infinity, and that brings me peace. I saw that in your eyes. I tried myself to like someone else, but I don‚Äôt see that in their eyes. There is something about you, the tension. You know you hypnotize me always. You fractured your finger last week, you sent me a picture when you were at the hospital, and then seeing you suffering in that pain at work made me feel uncomfortable, sorry. 

I definitely know I am delusional but I need to let myself out sometimes, hence I write this. If there was ever something, I‚Äôd wish there is a reality, some other universe , where we are born in the same religion, and we are happily together, sharing each others problems and sharing each others happiness. I really love you, I am trying my best not to. But may you find a man that you feel the same for, and may that man keep you safe and feel the same, at this point that is all I could ask for.

1l3oycn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3oycn,Ketl Tomfoolery travel pants review,"Alright, I'll be that guy who posts a pants review. But hear me out. I've been hunting for the unicorn of pants for years and might have actually found something.

The Problem: Finding one pair of pants that actually ""does it all"" and not just what the marketing says. Casual enough for the city, comfortable enough for long days and still durable and stretchy in case I want to hike in them.

What I tested: KETL Tomfoolery Pants, quirky name aside I got them in March and have been wearing them 2-3 times a week since.

Pros:
‚óè    Actually look normal. Not ""outdoor bro"" normal, just... normal
‚óè    Handled a lot of different situations: multiple hiking trips, bike commuting, working from coffee shops
‚óè    Water just rolls off them, which was clutch during an unexpected downpour on a trail
‚óè    The stretch is solid and I can actually move without feeling restricted
‚óè    Pockets have zippers (surprisingly rare feature)

Cons:
‚óè    Price point is on the higher side (~$95). Quality feels worth it, but definitely an investment
‚óè    Sizing runs a touch large, I'm usually a 32, which would be their size medium but I went down to size small (29-31) and it worked better. Waist band is stretchy which is nice but also means you need to pick a size range. They do have free returns and exchanges which I did utilize.
‚óè    The small orange'ish label on the left pocket is a bit ""loud"" and I don't mind the mismatched back pocket style but I could see some not liking that.

Bottom line: These have basically streamlined my wardrobe. I'm down to wearing these + one pair of jeans + gym shorts. My closet feels more minimal now.

Worth considering if you're in a similar situation - tired of outfit changes and want something versatile. Might not be necessary if you're already happy with your current rotation.

I am 20 and got the diagnosis from a cardiologist in March. I've had the symptoms my entire life, however. It has come to the point where my job at a busy coffee shop is beginning to risk my health. I honestly am not sure how I have gone this long without a medical emergency. My heart rate is consistently racing for the entireties of my 6-8 hour shifts, and usually stays high for hours after I get home. 
Though I have this diagnosis, and others related to chronic pain and chronic GI issues, I am extremely doubtful that I will be accepted for disability. Yes, I can't work right now because of my disabilites. YES, I struggle to do basic tasks at home because of them as well. But yes, I have been working anyways!! I have no choice, I have no other way to afford life right now. My family can't support me. 
I wish age was not a factor in any of this. If I were 60 with the exact same symptoms and diagnoses, they'd probably give me the benefits with such few questions. But I am a 20 year old girl. And I can't possibly be risking my life by mopping a cafe.
I wish they'd just compensate for my rent while I found a new job. I don't even need permanent compensation. But I am going to get myself hurt if I keep working on my feet for long hours. No, they can't accommodate me by letting me sit. Its a busy cafe and I need to run around endlessly to keep the business moving.

1l3oxy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3oxy1/the_hitchhiker_part_1/,The Hitchhiker ( Part 1),"I stand in front of the gates of hell. 

Above the tunnel's entrance, the words stare back at me, burning into my brain, searing me with a paralyzing, primal fear. I never should have left my house in Manchester. None of this would have happened if I hadn't. Now I stand here, one last time. I don't know what comes at the end. That certainty was yanked out from under me.

I never deserved this. All I wanted was to see my family again. I had plans‚Äîso many plans, things I wanted to do to make up for the time I missed. This trip was supposed to be a new beginning‚Äîa beginning that I would never see.

That day, I left later than planned. Time is a fickle thing‚Äîit slips through your fingers before you even realize it. By the time I noticed, the day was already gone‚Äîthe winter sun had started to set, staining the horizon with a deep, bloody red.

My trip faded into nothing but a slow, mindless crawl through rush hour traffic‚ÄîNumbly daydreaming as I inched slowly through the highway. When it seemed hopeless‚Äîstuck between impatience and resignation‚ÄîI decided to take a detour, getting off Route 6 and turning onto Route 44 at the fork.

The change was slow but distinct. The suburban sprawl gave way to dense, endless forest‚Äîthe trees bunched so tightly together that they only broke occasionally to reveal rare glimpses of weathered-down houses perched on the roadside. I watched as the sun slipped beyond the horizon, giving way to a black, starless sky.

My car's headlights being the only source of light that night,¬† lighting up the thin strip of road ahead of me. The only sounds were the low hum of the engine and the rustle of trees as the wind swept through their dry leaves. It was a quiet, meditative silence‚Äîso deep that I almost didn't notice him.

A man stood alone on the side of the road. His arm was outstretched, thumb raised‚Äîa classic hitchhiker‚Äôs gesture. His other hand waved over his head.

Looking back, I curse myself for that moment. My action was fueled by no more than a smidgen of empathy. Nonetheless, my car screeched to a stop just a couple of feet away from the man. Glancing at the side mirror, I saw him slowly approaching my car. I sighed and rolled down the passenger-side window, leaning slightly toward it

‚ÄúHey, stranger! What are you doing out here at this hour?‚Äù

The man walked up to the open window and leaned in. Now that he was closer, I could get a better look at him.

He looked to be in his late 30s, maybe early 40s‚Äîand definitely not dressed for the frigid conditions outside. His red flannel shirt was too big for his wiry frame, hanging loosely over his shoulders. His hair was long and matted, a tangled mess of red, and his beard was short but unkempt.

He looked at me with eyes as dark as green pine and smiled.

‚ÄúOh, thank God you stopped for me,‚Äù he said, his voice unnervingly cheerful for the situation he was in.‚Äú I was starting to get worried‚Äîthought no one was gonna come down this road tonight.‚Äù

His tone was far too chipper for a man standing out in the dead of winter. I couldn't help but question it, raising my eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou seem to be having a good time out here friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no, it‚Äôs not that... I‚Äôm just glad to finally see someone else out here, you know? I‚Äôve been out here for a while now. Didn‚Äôt really expect to be stuck out here this late at night,‚Äù he said, offering a friendly chuckle before rubbing the back of his head.

‚ÄúSo then... What happened? Why are you here?‚Äù I asked, a hint of suspicion creeping into my voice.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of embarrassing, actually,‚Äù he admitted, glancing away. ‚ÄúI was taking a taxi on my way to my place, but... well... when the driver realized I didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay for the whole trip, he kicked me out and drove off. I‚Äôve been waiting here since. ‚ÄùAlmost on cue, a cold gust blew past us, making us both shiver as the mistress cold wrapped around our figures.

‚ÄúWhere were you headed?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúCranston,‚Äù the stranger replied.

Almost reflexively, I scoffed.‚ÄúCranstonian,‚Äù I muttered with a sarcastic tone.

The man shot back with a smug smile. ‚ÄúPVD hipster,‚Äù he quipped.

I stared at him, genuinely surprised.

‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù I asked, baffled.

The stranger just shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got it written all over you,‚Äù he said with a mischievous grin.

‚ÄúOh, fuck you,‚Äù I chuckled, knowing he was completely right. Our laughter faded quickly, swallowed by the drifting wind as it swept through, stealing away the brief joy and leaving only the eerie silence of the night. We looked at each other for what felt like ages before I finally spoke.

‚ÄúSigh... hey man, look‚Äîwhy don‚Äôt you just hop in? Cranston‚Äôs on the way. I could drop you off.‚Äù

His face lit up with a grateful smile‚Äú Ha, thanks a lot ! ‚Äù he said as he opened the door and got into the passenger seat. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve got money back at my place, I promise. Once we get there, I‚Äôll pay you back. I swear.‚Äù

Honestly, I highly doubted it. He didn‚Äôt look like the type of guy who had any money‚Äîstruck me as more of a drifter. But maybe it was some sort of kinship with this man, or just a willingness not to be alone for the next few miles, that made me let him tag along for the ride.

As the stranger got situated in my passenger seat, I started the car and got back on the road.

‚ÄúWow, this is ancient‚Äîa Caprice! I haven‚Äôt been in one of these since my uncle had one. How the hell do you keep her running?‚Äù the stranger exclaimed, laying his hand on the dashboard like it was something sacred.

I smirked at that. ‚ÄúIs my car the reason you wanted to get in?‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúMore or less,‚Äù the stranger chuckled to himself, leaning back in the seat with a comfortable grin. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. It was nice to finally have someone to break the monotony of my drive.

And so, that‚Äôs how we spent the rest of our ride‚Äîjust talking. About everything and nothing.

We talked about our favorite films, books, shows, and everything in between. We debated which coffee chain truly had the best brew and which one was overrated. We swapped stories about our time in university, laughing over which professor had the worst reputation in Rhode Island. We argued about which restaurant was the best spot to dine and dash‚Äîeven though I don‚Äôt really do that anymore. We reminisced about our childhoods, and at some point, we even opened up about our fears and regrets. It was endless.

To say this stranger was enigmatic would be an understatement. He was just... easy to talk to. Like we‚Äôd known each other for years.

""It wasn't your fault"" the stranger said, genuine sympathy leaking into his words. I tightened my grip on the wheel at this and sighed. After all this time, what felt like millennia of pain, I needed to hear those words‚Äîand they came from a man I knew nothing about.

""I just wish I knew what was going on through her head. Why would she do such a thing?"" I confessed to the stranger, the truth was at the end of Faith's life , I truly didn‚Äôt know her.

""Sometimes we don't know the full extent of a person,"" the stranger said thoughtfully. ""We don‚Äôt know what's going on in their head. We‚Äôre terrible at telling people how we feel. I wish it got better with age, but it doesn‚Äôt really. We‚Äôre afraid to tell those we love the truth‚Äîperhaps in a way, we‚Äôre afraid of facing it ourselves.""

Silence.

""You must have loved her a lot?"" the stranger asked gently.

""Yeah... a lot. So, so much."" Each word hurt to say, like thorns piercing into my heart.

""I'm truly sorry. I know it doesn‚Äôt mean much coming from me, but I am sorry for your loss Alex"" the stranger said, with a genuine, empathetic sadness etched across his face.

""Yeah... thank you,"" I said softly.

Silence again.

""Christ, you really know how to make a man spill his guts, huh?"" I joked, breaking up the awkward silence that loomed between us.

""Yeah. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm a good listener. I don‚Äôt really know how, honestly. I‚Äôve always just been good at Empathizing,"" the stranger said, leaning back in his chair.

""That being said, I never would have guessed you spent a couple of years in prison. The PVD Hipster part I could read, but not the jail thing‚Äîyou don‚Äôt look like someone who‚Äôs spent time in the slammer.""

""Do ex-convicts usually have a look to them?"" I questioned him.

""Usually, yeah. They act all rough, constantly on edge‚Äîlike they have something shoved up their ass. Honestly, they probably already have"" the stranger remarked.

""Holy shit dude!"" I said, genuinely surprised.

""It happens more than you think.,,,,,,, You don't swing that way do you ?"" He gave me a skeptical, playfully horrified look.

""No, no, no, no! Jeez, ha, stop, dude. My time in prison wasn‚Äôt that bad. I spent most of my time staying out of people‚Äôs way and minding my own business. Kind of what helped me in the end, now that I think about it. People really don‚Äôt bother you if they don‚Äôt acknowledge you exist. I spent most of my time working on myself there‚Äîread a lot, mostly religious texts. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not trying to convert you. After the drug bust, I spent some time really reflecting on my life‚Äî spiritual shit, you know. After Faith‚Äôs death, I was shattered. I did some really stupid shit. That forced solitude really gave me time to reflect and get myself straightened out.""

""I'm glad you're doing better now. Would have been a shame‚Äîwould‚Äôve never gotten to meet you then,"" the stranger said, looking out the window toward the dark, inky blackness outside. That‚Äôs when it dawned on me‚ÄîI never really got the stranger‚Äôs name. I felt guilty about not knowing. Here this stranger was, listening to my issues with all my complicated emotions, and I couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to ask his name.

""Hey, sorry if this is out of the blue, but I never really got your name. What is it?""

Silence.

I spared a glance to where he was seated‚Äîhe was still staring out my passenger-side window, entranced by the murky blackness. Deducing that he must not have heard my question, I nudged him with my elbow.

He felt cold.

""Holy shit, dude! Your a fucking ice cube!"" I exclaimed, startled.

At this, the stranger was pulled away from his trance as he turned to look at me.

""Huh? S-Sorry, what did you say before that?"" he asked groggily, as if he had just woken up from a dream.

""I asked your name. But never mind that‚Äîdo you need me to turn on the car heater? You shouldn‚Äôt be this cold,"" I asked him, still unnerved.

""Oh, no, you don‚Äôt have to do that. I‚Äôve always been this cold. You‚Äôre not the first one who‚Äôs ever touched me and said the same thing,"" he answered, as casually as he could manage.

""Are you sure that's normal? ""

""Don‚Äôt worry about it. It‚Äôs normal,"" he abruptly cut me off. To my chagrin, I realized I must have hit a nerve.

""You asked for my name, right? Sorry, I was distracted. Sometimes... I forget. It just takes me a while to remember it,"" he said, his tone distant.

I was taken aback by this. What the hell was he talking about? I stared at him, eagerly waiting as he continued.

""It‚Äôs an old name. It takes me a bit of time to translate it into a more common word. It‚Äôs Cha‚Äî""

HOOONK!

I yanked the steering wheel to the right as a pair of bright headlights came rushing toward us. My car swerved back into the correct lane just in time as a semi-truck roared past us, missing by a hair. My heart was pounding heavily in my chest‚ÄîI could have died. Worse, I could have gotten both of us killed. One more second, and we would have been smear on the asphalt.

I instantly turned toward the stranger to offer my apologies for my carelessness, but he just stared back at me, unfazed, and shrugged.

""They‚Äôre coming from Naraka. They are at fault for trying to outrun the inevitable,"" he said, his tone still cold.

That caught me by surprise. How did he know where the truck was coming from?

""N-Naraka? W-What the hell are you talking about?"" I blurted out.

The stranger just dismissively waved his hand at that.

""You wouldn‚Äôt remember. No one really does. Some people pass through it; others don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äîwe‚Äôre almost there."" the strange said What the fuck was he talking about? The stranger was completely different now. What used to be a joyful and enigmatic individual had transformed in an instant‚Äîa cold, uncaring presence now sat beside me. It was like someone else had taken his place, and it all happened with the snap of a finger. Still, there was a strange gleam in his eyes, a kind of feverish light.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there,‚Äù he muttered, his voice carrying a strange, almost nostalgic tone‚Äîlike someone returning home after years away.

‚ÄúHey, hey! What the fuck, man? What‚Äôs with this switch? You‚Äôre creeping me out. I thought you were from Cranston. You... you haven‚Äôt been lying to me, right?‚Äù I snapped, my nerves frayed by his sudden change. I hated being creeped out, and this was pushing it too far.

No response.

I turned toward the stranger. He was staring straight ahead, eyes reflecting a gleam as if a light was bouncing off them. How?

‚ÄúYou know... the jumping spider lets itself look like prey when it meets other spiders,‚Äù he blurted out, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.

‚ÄúAlright, fuck this. Get out of my car,‚Äù I growled, gripping the wheel tighter. I didn‚Äôt know who this guy thought he was, but I didn‚Äôt appreciate being deceived. Whoever this man in my passenger seat was now, he wasn‚Äôt the same guy I‚Äôd been spilling my guilt to earlier.

‚ÄúKeep your foot on the pedal. You‚Äôll die if you let go.‚Äù

I froze. He turned to me, and that‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîhis eyes were pure darkness, void-like, with a single pinpoint of light, sharp as a needle tip, glowing in the center. My heart spiked, but my mind was clearer than ever. I didn‚Äôt know why, but I did as he said. At that moment, I believed him. I truly believed that if I stopped, I would die.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny, really,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe spider thinks itself so mighty within its web‚Äîsafe, invincible. Everything that steps into it is his prey. He knows he‚Äôs stronger, so he pursues the weaker ones, because that‚Äôs the law of his world. But he forgets the true law of nature... that he too can be hunted.‚Äù

The man kept talking, his voice cold, almost analytical.

‚ÄúAlex, you‚Äôve lied to me. Ever since this trip started, you‚Äôve lied‚Äîto me, to yourself. I thought I could offer you comfort, Alex. But seeing you now... you make me sick. You truly deserve this.‚Äù

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúW-what do I deserve?‚Äù I whispered, forcing the words out.

He just looked straight ahead again. Then, he said it, low and calm, but it carried a weight that made my stomach drop.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my stop.‚Äù

The tunnel appeared suddenly, emerging from the darkness‚Äîa massive, gaping mouth ready to swallow us whole. Above it, a green sign, in words, faded from time.

Welcome to Naraka.

I barely had time to process it. My reaction was slower than it should have been, overwhelmed by dread. We were swallowed by the tunnel, and in that instant, every sense vanished. There was no sound, no light‚Äîno feeling at all. Just nothingness.

I slammed the brakes, forcing myself to stay conscious despite the paralyzing fear.

When the car finally jerked to a halt, I found myself on the other side of the tunnel. My senses returned‚Äîthe rustle of leaves in the wind, the warmth of the sun on my skin, and my heartbeat thundering in my ears.

I looked to the passenger seat, ready to yell, ready to shove him out.

But there was no one there. The seat was empty, positioned just as it had been before I picked him up. I sat there, alone on the other side of the tunnel.

Alone in Naraka.

Milliseconds became seconds, seconds became minutes. Time continued to march on as I sat in my car on the other side of the tunnel. My mind played on repeat what had just happened. The pit in my stomach grew deeper and deeper‚Äîa sense of absolute dread.

How did he disappear!? He was right there! No‚Äîhow was that possible!? What did he mean? Is this Naraka!? Am I in Naraka!?

I pushed those thoughts down, breathing deeply as I shoved them into the dark recesses of my mind. I had to compose myself‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have time to unravel. I wasn‚Äôt going to spend another minute here. Whatever had just happened, I wasn‚Äôt going to deal with it. There was a pathway a couple of miles back that would take me back to my original route‚ÄîRoute 6. I resolved to reach it.

I turned the car around and stopped. I stared at the empty darkness in front of me ‚Äîa black hole that consumed all light. I tightened my grip on the wheel and drove into the tunnel.

In a few seconds, I was out on the other side. I glanced at my rearview mirror and felt relief wash over me as I saw the green sign slowly fade into the distance.

It wasn‚Äôt long before I fell into a quiet, empty state, staring at the road‚Äîmy brain an empty static of dead channels as I watched the double lines on the road pass by. I refused to let myself think about the situation throughout the drive.

It was in that empty state that a thought wormed into my subconscious. How long had I been driving? I glanced at my car radio clock: 2:34.

My sense of time was nonexistent in that numb state, but I‚Äôd been driving for what felt like ages. Why hadn‚Äôt I seen the exit by now?

I kept driving, desperately hoping to find an exit‚Äîa break in the trees, a house, anything other than the mass of looming black giants swaying in the breeze. But the exit never appeared.

I pulled my car over to the side of the road and reached into my glove compartment, pulling out a worn-out map. I gently unfolded it, the paper crinkling as I laid it on the driver‚Äôs wheel and scanned for any nearby road. It took me a while to pinpoint my last location, but there it was‚ÄîSouth Frontage Road. My door out of hell.

I threw the map onto the passenger seat and glanced at the car clock.

The digital display still read 2:34.

My fist connected with the car radio. My breath was lodged in my throat as I continued to slam my fist into the digital display. Each hit became more frantic, more desperate‚Äî a quiet prayer whispered between every strike, begging it to change. To move just a single digit.

Nothing happened.

Then the car radio turned on.

My fist froze in mid-air, just inches away from striking again. I stood there, paralyzed like a deer in headlights, as a faint sound slipped into the static‚Äîa faint, distant sound of a woman weeping.

It lasted no more than a few seconds before abruptly cutting off, leaving an empty silence.

Desperation fueled me as I got back onto the road, panicked I pressed my foot into the gas pedal. My car started to pick up speed, tearing down the road. I didn‚Äôt care at that point‚ÄîI just wanted out. Honestly, the idea of going to prison again, a couple weeks behind iron bars, was nothing compared to this endless, black road.

My eyes darted from side to side, searching for signs‚Äîanything to prove that I wasn‚Äôt losing my mind, that there was a way out of this.

Then, like a revelation, my eyes caught the glimmer of a sign reflecting off my headlights: South Frontage Road.

My tires screeched as I swerved onto the road‚Äîmy escape route.

I eventually eased off the gas pedal. Once I had put enough distance between me and Route 44, I let out a sigh of relief and began to relax. I was home free. If I kept going down this road, I would eventually hit 295‚Äîand from there, freedom, normalcy.

Shhhhhhh

The radio turned back on.

Static filled the entire car once more, accompanied by the sound of a woman crying.

It was soft again, just under the grating noise of the static, but it pierced through as clear as day.

I froze, my breath caught between my throat. The crying was familiar. It was‚Äî

‚ÄúFuck this!‚Äù The words escaped my mouth as I reached to turn off the radio.

Shhhhh

It never turned off.

I pressed the button again.

Shhhhhh

I pressed it again. And again. And again. The cries grew louder.

The wailing continued to intensify‚Äîblending into a chorus of new voices. The voices of people pleading, sobbing, wailing. Each one distinct as they began to merge into a sick, rising cacophony, growing louder and louder, until it drowned out the static completely.

My blood turned to ice as a single word broke through the chaotic noise‚Äîa hateful, high-pitched scream. A name. My name.

‚ÄúAlex!‚Äù

A dam broke within me as memories flooded in‚Äîmemories I had tried to suppress. That voice‚Äîit was familiar.

‚ÄúAlex! Alex! ALEX!‚Äù The woman‚Äôs voice continued to yell.

Other voices joined in, rising in violent, chaotic harmony‚Äîa choir of hate calling my name over and over again.

I tried to block it out‚Äîto suppress and bury it deep. But it was too much. The memories crashed into me, threatening to drag me down under.

Until‚Äî

Screeeeech

I slammed my foot on the brake, skidding to a halt.

The voices stopped.

For a moment, it was as if the world had paused. My breathing slowed, and my pulse pounded in my ears as I struggled to focus at what was in front of me¬†

Then I saw it.

Hanging above the tunnel entrance, in words, faded from time .

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right laptop in this price category necessitates a careful evaluation of key features. These are the most critical components to consider when making your selection.

**Processor:** The processor is the brain of the laptop, influencing its ability to handle everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, and multimedia playback.Intel Core i3 and i5 processors, as well as AMD Ryzen 3 and ryzen 5 processors, are common in this price range. Look for models that offer at least a quad-core processor for better multitasking capabilities.these should also be the latest generations of those processors.

The processor‚Äôs clock speed and cache memory also play a role in performance. A higher clock speed enables faster processing of instructions, while a larger cache memory allows the processor to access frequently used data more quickly. These together can result in smoother overall performance and improved responsiveness.

**RAM (Random Access Memory):** RAM directly affects a laptop's ability to handle multiple applications simultaneously. 8GB of RAM is generally recommended for smooth multitasking and handling demanding software,though increasingly 16GB would be the optimum starting point. Some laptops in this price range might offer 4GB, but that can limit performance if you anticipate running multiple programs or working with large files.

The speed of the RAM, measured in MHz, also contributes to performance. Faster RAM can transfer data more quickly, improving overall system responsiveness.Ensure the laptop supports upgrading RAM if you anticipate future needs.

**Storage:** Storage capacity and type are critical factors. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is significantly faster than a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD), resulting in quicker boot times and snappier application loading. aim for at least a 256GB SSD,although a 512GB SSD is a more desirable space if you intend to store and work with large files or numerous applications.

While HDDs offer more storage space at a lower cost, their slower speeds can negatively impact overall performance. Some laptops might offer a combination of SSD and HDD, with the SSD handling the operating system and frequently used applications for speed, and the HDD for larger files.

**Display Quality:** The display impacts viewing comfort and productivity. Look for laptops with a full HD (1920x1080) resolution for sharp and clear visuals. Panel type, such as IPS (In-Plane Switching), offers wide viewing angles and accurate color reproduction, making it ideal for content consumption and graphic design.

Brightness, measured in nits, affects visibility in different lighting conditions. A brighter display is easier to view outdoors or in brightly lit environments. Consider a display with at least 250 nits of brightness for pleasant viewing.

**Battery Life:** A longer battery life is essential for users who need to work or play on the go. Look for laptops that offer at least 6-8 hours of real-world usage on a single charge. Battery life can vary depending on usage patterns, screen brightness, and the types of applications being used.

Battery capacity, measured in Watt-hours (Wh), indicates the amount of energy the battery can store. Larger battery capacities generally translate to longer battery life. Consider a laptop with a battery capacity of at least 40Wh for decent power.

i (20F) need some outside perspective on my bf's (25M) behavior is concerning or not. We've been together for 3 years and I‚Äôve started noticing a pattern that‚Äôs bothering me more and more.

Here are some examples:

* Recently, during a conversation, I asked him what team his coworker Mel is on (since he was the one who was initially mentioning her and also mentioned her brother Ben who's on his team. He was mentioning how they didn't do much work and were constantly chatting getting coffee on another floor). He initially dodged the question and claimed he didn‚Äôt know, which seemed odd because he was the one mentioning all these other details about her and her brother and how they worked. I already knew about the brother Ben because they're on the same team, but not much about Mel. I asked again later and he finally said she‚Äôs on the finance team and that was that. About 30 mins later I just had a weird feeling and asked why he didn‚Äôt just tell me that in the first place (This was all i said in a normal tone). He got defensive and angry and said ""I literally told you after!"" and ""I'm so annoyed right now"" when he was fine before during that 30 mins we were chilling after that convo.
* A while ago, I caught him deleting a DM from his male coworker on iMessage. I saw it before he erased it, and it said: *‚ÄúImma throw a ring at her.‚Äù* I asked him what that meant and why he deleted it, and he got annoyed again and said he did it *so I wouldn‚Äôt ask questions.* I pressed again, which he vaguely mentioned how there was some pretty girl sitting near his team in the cafeteria. His answer was so vague that to this day I still don't even know what it's referencing exactly and how that really comment really fits into that. I had a weird feeling at the time too but pushed it down after he gave me that answer.
* My boyfriend has a small all-male team at work. During a team bonding event\*\*,\*\* a few of them tried to cheat on their partners, one (Leon) even planned to lie to his fianc√©e to meet up with a girl at a bar and had his arm around her. Another (Ben) was going to cheat despite meeting his girlfriend‚Äôs parents the next day. My boyfriend didn‚Äôt participate, he left early, called me, and I fully believe he didn‚Äôt do anything shady, which I appreciated. His other 2 coworkers are not cheaters and I think are good dudes. He said he isn't friends with those cheaters.
* The issue for me was his reaction afterward. In the group chat, he joked about Ben ‚Äúit‚Äôd be crazyyy to cheat on her the day before meeting her parents,‚Äù and later insisted the other coworker Leon didn‚Äôt actually cheat because the girls scammed them for drinks, so nothing happened. But to me, the intent was clearly there, Leon would've cheated if he could've. I don‚Äôt understand why my boyfriend is so eager to defend that as ‚Äúnot cheating,‚Äù especially when Leon has a whole fianc√©e.
* I also found a blonde hair in his car. I have dark hair, and he claimed it must‚Äôve gotten stuck to his backpack somehow during his work trip back home. I think that is the case but just wanted to add it for more context for everyone's thoughts. I know he definitely didn't do anything shady during his work trip because he works very hard at his job and takes the work seriously.

  
Everyday in my prayer to God, I ask that my relationship with him is happy and healthy. But several days in a row, many times it's nonstop every time I sleep, I get horrible dreams of him cheating or doing something to betray me. In a way though, I get relieved when I wake up and realize that never happened in real life. Not sure if this part is relevant but this does affect my sleep.

Assalamualaikum everyone 

I just really want your sincere advice on what to do in my situation. I‚Äôm 32 btw not a child so this will put into context why I feel the way I do.

I got married few years ago and my wife came to live with me and my parents (not my idea). I didn‚Äôt have a job for about 6 months and my plan was to move out as soon as I started earning. 

My wife was very close with her parents and they kept telling her not to move out and they justified this by saying that because I‚Äôm the son I have every right to live with my parents. They did this just so we could save money and avoid paying rent. My parents were okay with it but they also expected we move out once I was stable in my job.

This was at the cost of the relationship with my parents. My parents grew to detest my wife and my relationship with them also soured. Granted they didn‚Äôt treat her the best. Also a lot of my wife‚Äôs fault too because she always called and sought advice from her mother about everything. She did always tell my wife to be respectful but when it came to money she wanted my wife to save every single penny. My wife carried this behaviour and kind of controlled how I spent what I earnt as well.

I think what pushed my parents over was how my wife treated my mom and sister on an overseas trip we went and again the issue was money.

Anyway things grew so bad and they eventually asked me and my wife to move out. We left and my wife and I hated my parents for a while. Didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt talk. I tried being nice to them and eventually slowly started to visit them and invited them over so it became somewhat cordial.

Anyway we lived by ourselves for a while and my wife got a good job opportunity in the country where her parents live. So we decided it would be best and I wanted to finish some studies so why not. Big mistake. I‚Äôve never gone from loving someone to despising them so fast. Idk Wthek I was thinking.

So then my mother in law was extremely overbearing. Shes calmed down a bit now but ‚Ä¶she would control how we drive the car where we take it in case we spend too much petrol, how we spend our money, hat we buy, she wants everything to go through her. She would yell scream fight 

I felt exhausted and still do. I‚Äôm trying to get out of this mess. I moved back to my country recently but they had moved here before me and I had to stay with them again until our place is ready to move into. She‚Äôs been much better here but she still has the tendency to give advice where not necessary. Her and my father in law ask me if I buy lunch outside if I buy coffee etc etc 

They‚Äôve calmed down but who do they think they are they can control me so much. I‚Äôm gonna move to my place as soon as it‚Äôs possible but idk going in the future I feel like I need to set some boundaries but idk how. I honestly feel like I am being bullied by people who think they have too much control over me. I‚Äôm exhausted. My wife stood up for me but I think even she‚Äôs tired.

I‚Äôm worried now they‚Äôve moved to the same city as me and my wife they‚Äôre continuously going to be overbearing.

She‚Äôs asks me everything in a demeaning and condescending way as if I‚Äôm spending her money. She‚Äôs trying to save us money as were paying off a loan but I‚Äôm not her child that she can control how I spend my money in fact it‚Äôs not her business to ask me these things.
She wants to know everything and always the first question is how much. She is always asking about the price. My in laws ask my salary. If I want to get a hair cut they will tell me to cut my hair at home. Like what I. The actual hell is this.

So I‚Äôve told my wife that I feel bulllied and her mother should not be asking me these things. I‚Äôm over it. But I‚Äôm afraid to speak up as I fear I‚Äôll get angry.

The only other way I‚Äôm thinking is I actually start exxagerating everything. I tell her how extravagantly I spend and watch her have a meltdown. Tell her I spend hundreds o n lunches , hair cuts , gifts. I just stop caring.

Idk how I answer them when they ask how much I earn. I have told them my salary tbh I didn‚Äôt mind as they tell me all their finances and they‚Äôre very transparent but it‚Äôs way to brag how they don‚Äôt spend anything it‚Äôs like a badge of armor for my mil. I don‚Äôt however like her asking me the nitty gritty. How much salary I make weekly. How much I bought this for. How much I spend on my holiday.

And yes I know I put myself in this situation. I let her stomp all over me. Yes I do feel like a doormat. But Insha Allah I will find a way to put a stop to this madness. 

Your feedback on how I approach this is welcome

Hi all

36f, USA,  combo skin,  constant sun exposure for to area of living (cannot get away, I wear sunscreen inside my house can't get away from it).

I'm currently using Alpyn Instant Bright Eye and Alpyn beauty line filling eye creams. 

I'm not seeing any difference. 

Bright eye helps occasionally but that's only when I have really bad dark circles (intermittent insomnia) and most of the time it really does nothing. 

The beauty line one just feels slimy and heavy. 


I need something for eye that I can put on at day and night that works for wrinkles/crows feet, and isn't super super heavy. I'm tired of feeling like I've slicked butter across my eyes and not getting any benefits. 

I'm not expecting instant/overnight erasure of crows feet (though it would be nice! ), but I do know that my eye area does get really dry throughout the day.

Retinol is not an option for me right now until winter time/ less sunlight- I am just way too sensitive for it (I've tried,  dermatologist told me to avoid if able during summer months cause I get red red red red red that won't go away for ages), even for night use,  my skin will still go apeshit the next day with any sun. 

I drink 3 40oz stanleys a day (it's a struggle lol but water is IMPORTANT), have a decently clean diet (if I don't make it we don't eat it. I cook a LOT),  though I did FINALLY quit vaping (3mo!) So I know that took a toll on my skin.  I do drink wine (2-3 glasses a week), lots of teas, never coffee. 

Budget is 100-200, but it really NEEDS TO WORK.  Sleep or not.

But now I'm at a fork in the road... I kindof hate every coffee table ever.  But I like to have a place to put my wine without worrying it's going to end up all over me. 

This sofa set came with 2 huge cloud-y ottomans, that are kindof unfunctional at the moment. 

I'm thinking maybe I get a big giant walnut tray that is stable (but not permanent) and use that for the drinks, decor, moss bowl/ succulent tray, etc etc.  But that's probably not enough ""table space"" if there's more than a few people eating or drinking.  So do I supplement with end/ side tables on both ends of the sofa?  Again, running into the same problem of only finding heavy clunky IKEA looking tables .. which seem like coffee tables, just a tad smaller?  I cannot seem to find anything I like that seems like a fit for the space.

My first time writing need honest feedback 

What do you think of the story and the characters I‚Äôm writing please I want people honest feedback good and bad 

It was early fall on campus, and a slight chill drifted through the courtyard. Leaves rustled at the feet of clustered students, their jackets pulled tight, their laughter light and fleeting like the wind. Among the crowd stood Alex, hands shoved in his hoodie pocket, nerves fluttering in his stomach. He scratched the back of his neck, his voice uncertain but sincere as he stepped a little closer to the girl standing nearby.

‚ÄúHey, um‚Ä¶ Jean,‚Äù he began, his voice catching slightly. ‚ÄúHow are you doing? Haven‚Äôt seen you since summer. Now it‚Äôs fall‚Ä¶ and I guess I‚Äôm falling again.‚Äù

For a moment, there was silence. The small group quieted. Jean blinked, then let out a soft chuckle, her expression unreadable.

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶ yeah, Alex,‚Äù she said with a polite smile. ‚ÄúThat was‚Ä¶ a good joke.‚Äù

Before the moment could stretch too awkwardly, Paul‚Äôs voice cut in like a blade‚Äîloud, overly confident, his grin wide as he threw an arm around his girlfriend, Stacey.

‚ÄúOh boy, here we go again,‚Äù Paul called out. ‚ÄúThe ol‚Äô puppy eyes are back. Everyone, brace yourselves‚ÄîRomeo‚Äôs here!‚Äù

Stacey laughed softly at first, brushing his arm. But then she gave him a light smack and muttered, ‚ÄúStop it. Be nice.‚Äù

Paul shrugged, still smug. ‚ÄúI am nice. I just don‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt say anything wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know exactly what you did,‚Äù Stacey replied, folding her arms.

Alex stood quietly, his eyes lingering on them. It was always like this‚ÄîPaul would poke fun, Stacey would giggle and scold him, but she never really pulled away. Alex couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: if she didn‚Äôt like how Paul acted, why did she still lean into him like that?

Jean turned to him again, gently changing the subject. ‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶ it was a great summer. How was yours?‚Äù

Alex forced a grin. ‚ÄúOh, it was wild. Fought monsters, investigated the paranormal, stopped Desmond from unleashing alien tech‚Äîsaved the world.‚Äù

In his mind, it played out like a comic book. In reality, he‚Äôd spent the summer working behind the counter at a 7-Eleven.

Jean smiled kindly. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ at least you had fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta run,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúClass is calling. Bye, guys.‚Äù

She walked off with that same graceful ease, and Alex waved. Then he turned toward Paul, frustration creeping into his voice.

‚ÄúCome on, man. You‚Äôre my best friend. Why do you always gotta call me out in front of everyone?‚Äù

Paul laughed, already heading off. ‚ÄúBest friend? Please. You did this to yourself. Anyway, I‚Äôm not getting caught in your girl drama. I‚Äôm out.‚Äù

He walked away, leaving Alex standing alone in the courtyard. A sigh escaped Alex‚Äôs lips. He crouched down, picking up a small stone from the cracked pavement and rolled it between his fingers. The sky above was gray, thick with clouds.

‚ÄúFall sucks. College sucks,‚Äù he muttered to himself. ‚ÄúBut hey‚Ä¶ class is about to start.‚Äù

He tossed the stone aside and rushed off, late again.



It was a rainy Friday night at CJ‚Äôs Diner, one of the most popular spots for any college dorm crowd. Paul and Stacey were obviously together. Stacey was quiet and reserved, while Paul stayed quiet but observant, wearing a classic black and brown combo.
Stacey looked effortlessly graceful, wearing a typical white shirt and blue jeans.
They were the long-term couple ‚Äî going strong for six years, high school sweethearts.
The school crowd was there, and so was Jean ‚Äî tall, with long brown hair that curled softly over her shoulders. She smiled with grace and care. Everyone was having a swingin‚Äô time.
Alex walked in.
‚ÄúSooo‚Ä¶ Paul, thanks for the invite.‚Äù
Paul, exaggerating: ‚ÄúWho invites this guy again? Alright, I‚Äôma head out.‚Äù
Stacey laughed, brushing his arm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny. But stop ‚Äî be nice.‚Äù Then she turned to Alex with a monotone voice, but a warmth behind it. ‚ÄúHi, Alex.‚Äù
Then came Jeremy ‚Äî long-haired, rugged.
‚ÄúPaul, you‚Äôre such a jerk,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLeave him alone. Come on, Alex. Sit down.‚Äù
Alex tried, ‚ÄúCome on, Paul‚Ä¶ you intend me, right?‚Äù
Paul replied, ‚ÄúLoser? No. But whatever, I‚Äôma be nice today, I guess.‚Äù
As they all ordered food, Alex had a slice of pie with coffee. Jeremy had wings, listening to the soft jazz playing across the room. Paul and Stacey shared pancakes drizzled with syrup, while Paul munched on a ham and cheese sandwich. Alex looked around, enjoying the space and warmth in the air.
Boom.
Alex froze.
He saw her ‚Äî Jean ‚Äî walking in through the diner door, laughing with her friends. And just like that, something shifted inside him. His breath caught. It wasn‚Äôt just attraction; it was like gravity. A pull. As if the whole room dimmed and she was the only thing glowing.
Time slowed for a second.
Her hair flowed over her shoulders like soft waves, her smile easy and kind. She looked like she didn‚Äôt have to try to be beautiful ‚Äî she just was.
‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs here. She‚Äôs here,‚Äù Paul muttered, finishing his food.
But Alex wasn‚Äôt listening to Paul anymore. He was still staring at Jean.
Paul snorted. ‚ÄúBruh, I feel bad for that girl. She gotta deal with you. Poor girl gonna suffer.‚Äù
Alex, timid ‚Äî like a scared kid reaching for a flashlight: ‚ÄúShut up, Paul. I‚Äôm just asking for an honest opinion.‚Äù
Paul shot back, ‚ÄúYeah, and I‚Äôm giving you one, freak.‚Äù
Jeremy barked, ‚ÄúWanker! You‚Äôre so rude to him. What did he do to you?‚Äù
Paul shrugged, ‚ÄúHe was born. And annoying.‚Äù
He smirked, ‚ÄúWatch ‚Äî he gonna go over there like a little boy, say hi, and be weird.‚Äù
Stacey, drawn into the conversation: ‚ÄúWhy are you always like this, babe? What‚Äôs going on with you two?‚Äù
Paul shrugged, ‚ÄúNothing. He started it.‚Äù
Alex sighed, ‚ÄúUgh. Never mind. Sorry I asked.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell guys,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI made money this week. I‚Äôll pay for the appetizers and stuff.‚Äù
Paul lifted his coffee, warm and calm. ‚ÄúThanks, buddy.‚Äù
Stacey smiled. ‚ÄúYeah, thanks, Alex. Really sweet of you.‚Äù
Jeremy grinned, ‚ÄúYou got money now, huh? Lol ‚Äî thanks, man.‚Äù
Alex left quietly, picking up the crumpled twenty dollars he‚Äôd made doing a quick oil change.

From being on a PPI, having horrible side effects from it, changing my diet completely, losing over 25lbs, cutting coffee as a coffee lover, shortness of breath and many more life altering stuff. I‚Äôve cried many times in the last year. I‚Äôm still learning to manage my GERD/LPR and I still cry sometimes but I‚Äôve learned to accept it and look at it the most positive way I can. Since last year, I eat the healthiest I‚Äôve ever done in my life, I started talking therapy, I got closer to God, I‚Äôve manage my anxiety better, I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight, I go outside more, I basically try to live my life the best I can. I was also diagnosed with a brain tumor and it changed my perspective in life. Yes, I still miss my life before all of this and I miss the old me but I‚Äôm really proud of the new me. 

I wanted to share and give someone hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The path is not always paved but it can lead to something beautiful.

 in November, they‚Äôve lived here for a couple years. I am on the lease, I had to go through a background check by the landlord who actually owns this condo before I got approved to be signed onto this lease. We‚Äôre all renting. 

About a month or two ago they went out of town for almost a week and I agreed and was happy to take care of their pets. They have 4 cats and a small dog. 
Well the morning after they left to catch a flight I walk around the living room getting ready for work as if no one was watching. Wasn‚Äôt fully dressed. As I‚Äôm making my morning coffee I see a camera that was placed in the living room that happened to be pointed right at me. 
My stomach dropped and walked out of view. When I left for work I texted them in our group chat and told them to delete the footage if it was recorded and that I would be unplugging the camera if I had friends and/or my boyfriend coming over that weekend for their privacy. 
The girl roommate responded with a screenshot with the camera moved to the view of the cats‚Äô litter boxes (which are placed in front of one of the entrances of my bedroom door) and that they just forgot to move it back to the view of the litter boxes after they installed the camera. They said they didn‚Äôt text me about the camera because it was late at night and didn‚Äôt want to bother me. 

I was totally annoyed about it, but I wanted to be chill and not dramatic. I was still annoyed because even if the camera is out of view of the general area A) it‚Äôs still in a common area without my consent first B) it‚Äôs in front of one the entrances to my bedroom and C) even if I cannot be seen I could still be heard with convos with friends  if they logged into the live feed or if our motion was being recorded. 

I told the girl roommate about how I felt after they got back and they said they‚Äôre not even subscribed to motion detection on that camera and they don‚Äôt even really look at it. I let it go after that. 

Well a month later the other night I was mad at the guy roommate for being too handsy and overbearing with me when he was drunk. I unplugged the camera that night because I just had a bad feeling I was being watched. Also if they don‚Äôt even really use it like she said it shouldn‚Äôt matter right? 

Well that camera with re-plugged the next day.

1l3ol7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l3ol7g/am_i_the_problem_in_my_friendships/,Am I the problem in my friendships?,"I moved away from my hometown a few years back. I had some friends I had known for over 10 years online I went to visit them after a failed relationship. Ended up hitting it off with one of the guys and moved in with him. I was lonely and struggling to find my place in my new town. Struggling to make friends or find a good job. I had gained a lot of weight too and was getting over the trauma that happened with my ex. Finally after a year I was doing well, had a decent job and was gaining back a good amount of savings. But still was lonely. 

One of my bf‚Äôs friends was looking for a relationship and I got the idea to hook him up with someone I knew back home. I showed him a few girls and he didn‚Äôt really like them and then I thought about this one girl I was friends with years ago but we hadn‚Äôt seen or spoken since I moved here. So about a year and 1/2 at this point since I had been in contact with her. He ended up thinking she was cute I told him a bit about her and he was down to get to know her if she wanted to also get to know him. I said I would reach out to her and I did. I asked if she wanted to get in a game with all of us. She agreed. I‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt express the intentions to hook her up with my bf‚Äôs friend who was going to be playing with us but they actually ended up naturally hitting it off. 

Things were going good between them and she after a few months came here to visit with him. We hung out during this time and things were fine. She eventually did move here and was also struggling to find a job and so I got her a job with me but it just wasn‚Äôt for her and I could tell she was stressed and unhappy. She expressed this to me but it was stressing me out so I told her I couldn‚Äôt deal with her problems and that I gotten her a job and been paying for her coffee and lunches here and there bc I knew how it felt to not have a stable income but there‚Äôs nothing else I can do and for her to stop venting to me bc it was messing with my mental health. 

She ended up not wanting to hang out with me as much as I was hoping. I found myself becoming jealous because she was still close with friends from back home that she had and was making new friends here. She ended up quitting the job with me and starting at a new job. Which worried me because I felt this would distance us further as she‚Äôd continue to make new friends. I don‚Äôt mean to be that way I guess I‚Äôm a bit insecure. But I was right it did distance us more. 

Eventually we stopped hanging out all together and slowly stopping even texting. I ended up trying to text her and my texts weren‚Äôt going through as if she blocked my number but she still had me on social media so I assume she got a new number and didn‚Äôt give it to me. We go out as a group with our boyfriends and there friends here and there and I confronted her and asked if she hated me bc we never hang out. She told me she doesn‚Äôt hate me that she‚Äôs just busy and finding her place here. I tried to be understanding but it feels like there‚Äôs more than that to her lack of friendship. 

I still haven‚Äôt made any friends as every girl I‚Äôve befriended here ends up kinda just being insane and we end up having a falling out. I started making YouTube videos and TikTok‚Äôs in attempts to have social connections to distract myself from my loneliness. 

And for my bf, he is very introverted and plays video games all day. We use to do that together but I often want to go out and he doesn‚Äôt. I just struggle with friendships so badly and I don‚Äôt get why? Am I the problem?

1l3ojwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l3ojwy/apartment_1413/,Apartment 1413,"The faded pink robe, a garment of plush decay, clung to Amelia Finch like a second skin, or perhaps, a forgotten dream. Its belt, a casualty of some long-lost laundry cycle, had vanished into the ether years ago, leaving the fabric to hang open, a silent testament to its abandonment. Beneath this flimsy shroud, the delicate lacework of her panties, a sliver of dark silk against her pale flesh, offered the only true embrace. At twenty-eight, Amelia was an edifice of the average; her body neither sculpted by the gods nor blighted by disfigurement, merely‚Ä¶ functional. Her face, a composition of soft, unremarkable features, held a certain plainness, a canvas too often left unpainted by the brush of strong emotion. Yet, amidst this landscape of the ordinary, two startling prominences asserted themselves: her breasts. Naturally ample, their perky uplift defied the gentle tyranny of gravity, crowned by areolas of a tender pink, puffed like miniature souffl√©s, from which, in an exquisite inversion, her nipples receded, drawing inward, secrets whispered only to the soft confines of her brassiere, or to the cool caress of the air when the robe slipped aside. Her skin, from nape to ankle, thigh to abdomen, was a landscape meticulously denuded, shorn bald, a velvet-smooth expanse maintained with an almost surgical devotion.



Her apartment, number 1413, was a testament to curated detachment. Sunlight, when it deigned to visit, poured through the expansive, uncurtained windows, illuminating dust motes in a slow, celestial dance. No fire escape beckoned, no balcony offered a precarious perch; just glass, steel, and the sprawling, indifferent city beyond. The decor spoke of stark elegance: polished concrete floors, minimalist furniture with razor-sharp edges, a single, oversized abstract painting on the wall that seemed to hum with suppressed energy. It was a stylish cage, immaculate and silent, reflecting back to Amelia a life lived in exquisite, almost painful, order.



Her days unfolded with the precision of a clockwork mechanism, each hour a cog in the monotonous wheel of her solitude. Morning began not with an alarm's vulgar shriek, but with the subtle shift in the ambient light. She‚Äôd rise, the plush robe sighing around her, and move to the kitchen with the quiet grace of a specter. The ritual of coffee-making was her first prayer: the rhythmic thrum of the grinder pulverizing dark, fragrant beans, the delicate gurgle of the water as it dripped through the filter, each drop a tiny measure of time. The bitter aroma filled the air, a fleeting, potent warmth in the cool, still apartment.



Seated at her crystalline glass desk, the laptop became her portal, its screen a blinding rectangle of light against the muted tones of her living space. As a finance manager, her dominion was the monochromatic ballet of digits. Today, it was the forensic dissection of quarterly earnings, the ruthless hunt for anomalies in sprawling datasets. Her fingers, nimble and precise, danced across the keyboard, coaxing secrets from columns of figures, her brow furrowed in a concentration so absolute it bordered on trance. The low, incessant hum of the machine was the day‚Äôs constant companion, broken only by the almost inaudible sigh she might release as a particularly stubborn formula yielded to her will. Her gaze, unwavering, consumed the glowing text, the world beyond the screen‚Äîthe actual, breathing city‚Äîa distant, forgotten tableau. Lunch, an act of pure sustenance, was consumed at the desk, a utilitarian salad or a pre-packaged meal, its plastic tray a sterile island in the sea of her work.



The afternoon bled into the evening with seamless, uneventful progression. Virtual meetings, disembodied voices on a flat screen, offered no true communion. Her contributions were always measured, her tone neutral, her camera steadfastly off. She preferred the disembodied anonymity, a voice without a face, a mind without a body in the echoing void of digital space. The faces of her colleagues, glimpsed briefly in the grid, seemed like inhabitants of a parallel dimension, their triumphs and anxieties mere flickering pixels. As the light outside softened, fading from the sharp clarity of day to the melancholic glow of twilight, a subtle unease would begin to stir. The silence in her apartment, once a comfort, now began to feel less like peace and more like an expansive, encroaching vacuum.



The evening's true ceremony, the ablution, began with the delicate dance of scented candlelight. The tiny flames, wavering like trapped spirits, cast dancing shadows across the pristine white tiles of her bathroom. She would fill the deep porcelain tub, the rush of water a fleeting, thunderous roar in the quiet. Steam, thick and fragrant, rose to caress her face, momentarily obscuring her reflection in the mirror, transforming the harsh lines of reality into a soft-focus dream. Sinking into the scalding embrace of the water, her body exhaled, the day's tensions dissolving into the shimmering heat.



Then, the meticulous ritual of the blade. The razor, a gleaming sliver of surgical steel, was selected with reverence. Lathering her legs, she watched the pristine white foam bloom against her skin, then with a practiced hand, drew the scalpel-keen edge upwards. Each stroke was precise, deliberate, stripping away the invisible down, leaving behind a surface of velvet-smoothness, sensitive to the slightest breath of air. This same meticulousness extended to the most intimate geography of her body. With a quiet breath, she applied the foam to her pubis, the white cloud a stark contrast to the dark lace she had discarded. The razor followed, carving a path through the softest of hairs, leaving no trace, no shadow. It was an act of extreme privacy, a precise self-sculpting for an audience of one, a flawless, hairless expanse maintained with the precision of a votary.



Dripping and flushed, she would emerge from the bath, swathing herself in a large, thirsty towel, before returning to the familiar, comforting disarray of her open robe and the fresh lace of her panties. Dinner, a solitary affair, was consumed in the hushed elegance of her dining nook ‚Äì perhaps a simple pasta, its sauce a vibrant stain on the white ceramic, or a medley of roasted vegetables. Always, a book lay open beside her plate, a portal to a life beyond her own. She devoured narratives of impossible love, cosmic horrors, or intricate mysteries, vicariously experiencing the passions and terrors denied to her own existence.



Later, the television would flicker to life, its blue light a cold, flickering companion in the deepening gloom. She scrolled through an endless parade of streaming options, never quite settling, never quite engaged. The fabricated dramas, the curated emotions, felt both too distant and too close, a mirror reflecting a life she was not living. Eventually, the quiet, persistent thrum of exhaustion would guide her to her bedroom, the city lights outside her window twinkling like a scattered handful of indifferent diamonds. Sleep was often a shallow thing, her mind occasionally looping back to the day's spreadsheets, or drifting into vague, unformed yearnings that dissipated with the first hint of morning light.



The rap on the door, sudden and insistent, tore through the uncanny quiet of the evening. It was a little past ten, the city a muted, distant hum. Amelia, half-submerged in the plush cushions of her sofa, a well-worn paperback resting open on her bared thigh, froze. Her breath caught, a small, painful gasp in her throat. No one knocked. Not truly.



Then, again, a lighter, more questioning tap. ""Amelia? It's Sarah from 14B. Are you alright? We haven't seen you around much lately."" Sarah. Always Sarah, the building's self-appointed conscience, a woman whose boundless, effervescent sociability was a constant, gentle pressure against Amelia's carefully erected walls.



Amelia‚Äôs fingers tightened on the spine of her book, the thin pages crinkling. The robe, as if sensing the intrusion, slipped further open, revealing more of the dark lace. ""Yes, Sarah, I'm perfectly fine!"" she called out, the lie thin and brittle in the sudden stillness, her voice a shade too bright, too quick. ""Just a bit under the weather. Thank you for checking, though!""



She stood there, rigid, listening. A soft sigh, the whisper of fabric, the faint scuff of shoes against the carpet, then silence. Sarah had receded, a tide ebbing from her shores. Amelia released the breath she‚Äôd held, a shaky exhalation that tasted of dust and unspoken dread. She remained, suspended, her hand hovering over the doorknob, a barrier unbreached. The loneliness, a cold, familiar weight, settled back into her bones, a heavy cloak in the quiet, stylish, and eternally solitary chamber of her apartment. The door, a simple slab of wood, felt as impenetrable as a vault.





Three weeks passed. three weeks of deepening the grotesque stain emanating from apartment 1413. It commenced as a phantom whisper on the prevailing currents of the building's air conditioning, a scent so faint it was dismissed, waved away as the residue of a forgotten takeaway, a distant plumbing issue, or the spectral breath of urban grime clinging to the ventilation shafts. But as the days accumulated, stitching themselves into a ragged tapestry of time, the whisper grew into a murmur, then a low hum, and finally, a guttural, undeniable presence that seemed to cling to the very air. It was a smell that defied easy categorization, a complex blasphemy against the senses. Not merely the cloying sweetness of decay, nor the sharp tang of something putrefying, nor even the acrid bite of chemicals. It possessed a deeper resonance, a metallic undertone, like blood long dried on forgotten surgical tools, laced with the sickly, sweet perfume of lilies rotting in standing water, and something else, something profoundly animal and profound, hinting at flesh undone, at boundaries breached, at a hidden corruption blooming behind a sealed door.



The residents of the fourteenth floor, accustomed to the easy currents of communal existence ‚Äì the borrowed cup of sugar, the impromptu hallway chat, the shared lament about the rising cost of utilities ‚Äì found their social graces curdling. Sarah from 14B, whose initial pleasantry had been so readily rebuffed by Amelia‚Äôs disembodied voice, now found her inquiries laced with a mounting dread that tightened her throat. She would tap on the door, her knuckles brushing against the smooth, unyielding wood, and call out, her voice thin with anxiety, ""Amelia? Are you really alright? That smell‚Ä¶ it's getting rather strong, dear. Are you sure you don't need anything? I could pick something up for you."" From within, always the same unblemished voice, calm as still water over pebbles, a voice that never seemed to crack or waver, ""I'm fine, Sarah. Just‚Ä¶ a little indisposed. Thank you for your concern."" No click of a lock, no reassuring creak of hinges, no comforting crack in the door, no glimpse of Amelia. Just the flat, uninflected reassurance, made monstrous by the evolving stench that coiled from beneath the door, tasting of something utterly wrong.



And it wasn't just the smell. A new, unsettling malaise had begun to infest the floor, a creeping pestilence of the senses. The lights in the hallway, once a steady, reassuring glow, began to flicker erratically, sometimes dimming to a sickly orange pulse, sometimes snapping off entirely, plunging the corridor into an unnerving, transient darkness that felt more like a tangible presence than a mere absence of light. Neighbors would jump, startled, then glance nervously at 1413, as if the very darkness, the very power drain, emanated from within its sealed walls.



Then came the water. Or what appeared to be water. A strange, viscous blackness, thick as crude oil, began to pool sporadically in the indentations of the polished concrete floor. It appeared without warning, seemingly from nowhere, a glistening, opaque stain that defied logic. It had no discernible source; no burst pipes, no overflowing sinks could be traced back to its sudden appearance. It simply was. One morning, Mr. Henderson, the building manager, found a spreading slick outside apartment 1409, a few doors down from Amelia's. He knelt, his finger tentative, and touched the viscous liquid. It was cold, unnaturally so, and left a faint, disturbing oily residue on his skin that wouldn't wash off easily, clinging like a shroud. The building's maintenance staff scoured the pipes, checked every utility closet, but the source remained elusive, a dark, weeping mystery that clung to the floor like a spreading bruise on the building's very soul. The smell and the black water, the flickering lights, became an unholy trinity of dread, slowly tightening their grip on the residents of the fourteenth floor, twisting their anxieties into open fear.



In the small, awkward gatherings by the elevator, the theories began to bloom, wild and desperate. ""It's a burst pipe, I tell you,"" insisted Mr. Goldberg from 1401, trying to project an air of practicality, even as his face paled. ""Must be some kind of toxic mold growing in there. That's why she won't open the door. Afraid of the spores.""



""Mold doesn't smell like that, Arthur,"" countered Mrs. Rodriguez from 1407, clutching her purse tighter. ""That's‚Ä¶ that's like something dead. Like a whole animal. Or worse."" Her eyes flickered towards 1413, a morbid fascination warring with outright terror.



David, from 14C, Amelia‚Äôs direct neighbor across the hall, had grown noticeably gaunt, the constant presence of the stench eroding his appetite and his peace ""What kind of person changes their locks when they're 'a little indisposed' and their apartment is leaking‚Ä¶ that?"" He gestured vaguely at a fresh, inky stain near the communal recycling bins, its edges strangely precise, like a graphic design.



Sarah, her voice tight with suppressed hysteria, wrung her hands. ""But she said she was fine! Every time! So calm. It's not right. And the lights‚Ä¶ it's like the whole floor is cursed. My cat won't even go near her door anymore. Just hisses at it.""



""Maybe she's‚Ä¶ gone,"" suggested a young woman from 1410, her voice barely a whisper. ""And‚Ä¶ whatever she had in there‚Ä¶ started to decompose."" This theory, whispered in varying degrees of horror, was the one that truly settled, a cold, heavy stone in their stomachs. But if she was gone, then who was answering? The calm, even voice from behind the door became the central, most chilling mystery. Was it a recording? A trick of the air? Or something else entirely? The black water and the flickering lights seemed to confirm their darkest imaginings, hinting at something beyond the mundane, a slow, invisible transformation within Amelia's sealed world.



The smell, now a monstrous, palpable entity, had permeated the entire building. It clung to clothes, seeped into hair, and tasted metallic on the tongue, a constant, sickening reminder that invaded their private lives. Finally, the collective unease, sharp as a sliver of glass, prompted a formal, desperate call to the building manager, a plea for intervention that carried the weight of their sanity.



Mr. Henderson, a man whose placid demeanor usually only ruffled when rent was late, arrived with his master key, a ring of glinting steel that promised access to every private world within his domain. He tapped on 1413, a brisk, confident rhythm, hoping to project an air of calm authority that he was rapidly losing. ""Ms. Finch? It's Mr. Henderson, the building manager. We've had a few‚Ä¶ concerns, some rather unusual reports. Just a quick wellness check, if you please.""



Silence, thick and expectant, descended. Then, that calm, unsettling voice, as unblemished as a fresh-dug grave. ""I assure you, Mr. Henderson, all is well. There is no need for alarm. My‚Ä¶ indisposition is simply taking a little longer to pass.""



Henderson frowned, his nostrils flaring involuntarily at the overpowering stench that now seemed to emanate directly from the door, a foul breath from beneath the crack, moist and heavy. He inserted his master key, twisting the brass with a confident snap. It turned freely, without purchase, spinning uselessly in the lock. He tried again, jiggling, rattling, forcing. Nothing. A chill, colder than any air conditioning, snaked up his spine. Amelia Finch had changed the locks. A defiant, solitary act that spoke volumes of her hermetic will, a sudden, brutal severing of her last tangible link to the outside world, a barrier raised against a world she had decided to abandon.



The police arrived swiftly, two uniformed officers, their faces initially etched with the weary patience of routine calls, an almost condescending pity for the hysterical neighbors. They knocked, harder, announcing their presence with official, unyielding authority. ""Police! Open the door, please, Ms. Finch! We have received reports of a strong odor and other‚Ä¶ unusual occurrences."" Again, the voice, unchanged, unperturbed by the blare of their presence, an impossible calm. ""There is no need for your presence, officers. I am quite alright. Please leave me to my privacy.""



A frustrated sigh escaped the lead officer, his jaw tightening. They conferred briefly, then the first officer, a burly man whose bulk seemed to absorb the hallway's oppressive atmosphere, raised a heavy boot, aiming for the plate beside the knob. The impact was a dull, shattering boom that echoed down the hallway, rattling the teeth of unseen residents behind their own doors. Yet, the door to 1413 held. Unyielding. A second kick, a third, each one a desperate, failing assault against the silence within. The wood groaned, the frame shuddered, splinters flying, but the door, a golem of wood and steel, remained an impenetrable maw. It was as though the very air behind it had solidified, bracing it against their invasion, infused with an unseen, unholy resolve.



The locksmith, summoned from his quiet domesticity, arrived, his tools clinking in a canvas bag, a mundane counterpoint to the escalating horror. He was a small, meticulous man, accustomed to defiant mechanisms, but even he seemed to shrink in the presence of the burgeoning stench, his eyes watering. He worked slowly, deliberately, the small scraping and clicking sounds of his instruments a grotesque counterpoint to the pervasive, fetid perfume emanating from the door. Minutes stretched into an eternity, each tick of his watch a measure of escalating dread. Sweat beaded on his brow, blurring his vision, the task proving far more obstinate than any he had encountered in recent memory. It was as if the very lock had a will of its own, imbued with a malignant life force, refusing to yield to the prying metal, a desperate resistance to exposure, to the intrusion of the mundane world into whatever horrific sanctity lay beyond. The air, thick with the unholy scent, seemed to grow heavier, pressing in on them.



And then, with a final, protesting groan of tortured metal, a sound like a cry of surrender from something unwillingly broken, the mechanism yielded. A soft, wet click, almost audible over the oppressive silence. The door, which had seemed so impossibly bound, stood unlocked. The lead officer took a deep, fortifying breath, a grim set to his jaw, and placed his hand on the cold doorknob. He turned it, slowly, the dread in the hallway thick enough to taste, a sour, metallic tang on the tongue.



The door swung inward.



The door to apartment 1413 finally yielded, a groan of tortured metal and splintered wood, swinging inward to reveal not a silent, hermetic sanctuary, but a gaping maw. Yet, before the light of the hallway could fully penetrate the abyssal gloom within, before the living could truly cross that threshold into the domain of the corrupted, the narrative of Amelia Finch demanded its final, brutal prelude.

The Final Night



hours passed, before the locksmith‚Äôs tools finally cracked the defiant shell of 1413, Amelia Finch had been engaged in the quiet sacrament of her evening meal. Pasta, a simple and unchallenging dish, lay congealed on her plate, a testament to her waning appetite. Her well-worn paperback, a tale of ancient, forgotten horrors, lay open beside her, its pages soft beneath her fingertips. The plush robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a faint shadow against her skin. The only sounds were the distant, anonymous hum of the city, the soft rustle of the turning page, and the occasional clink of her fork against ceramic. Her plain face, usually a mask of mild indifference, was softened by the low glow of the reading lamp, revealing the subtle hollows beneath her cheekbones, the slight puffiness around her inverted nipples that sometimes appeared when she was relaxed. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually a smooth, cool expanse, was subtly flushed from the warmth of the meal and the quiet comfort of her solitary ritual.



Then, the world outside her meticulous routine exploded.



With a sound like thunder, the door to her apartment‚Äîthat very door now being forced open by the police‚Äîburst inward from its frame. Wood splintered, metal shrieked, and a gust of foul, cold air, laden with the stench of something unspeakably wrong, assaulted her. Amelia gasped, her book scattering to the polished floor, a sudden, sharp clatter against the silence. Framed against the shattered entryway stood a figure, stark and terrible: a man cloaked in absolute black, every inch of his form swallowed by dark fabric, his face obliterated by the blank, malevolent void of a black ski mask. In his hand, he held a bludgeon, a heavy, crude club, its surface rough and dark, glinting wetly in the faint light that pierced the doorway.



Terror, a cold, sharp blade, pierced through Amelia's habitual lethargy. It was a sensation so raw, so alien, that it jolted her from her quiet drone, stripping away the layers of monotonous comfort and revealing the trembling animal beneath. Her plain face contorted, a mask of pure, uncomprehending fear, her eyes wide, showing too much white. She screamed, a raw, choked sound torn from a throat unused to such utterance, a sound that grated in the sudden, abyssal silence, and scrambled from the table, overturning her chair in a desperate scramble. The crash of ceramic and wood was swallowed by the sudden, guttural roar of her attacker, a sound of pure, bestial hunger. He moved with a horrifying speed, a dark blur against the fading light of the hallway, a creature of pure, unadulterated intent, a shadow given terrible form. The first blow was aimed at her head, a whistling descent that she barely ducked, the wind of its passage tearing at her hair, a chilling caress of imminent violence. It struck the wall behind her with a sickening thud, leaving a deep gouge, a wound in the very fabric of her home, a testament to the brute force unleashed.



""No!"" she shrieked, her voice thin, useless, utterly inadequate against the encroaching darkness and the relentless, mechanical advance of her assailant. He came at her again, relentless, a predator claiming its due. Her legs, usually so languid, pumped with a sudden, desperate energy she hadn't known she possessed, fueled by a primal need to survive. She fled, tripping over the scattered remnants of her dinner, a desperate, instinctive flight, a flight of pure, unthinking survival. The apartment, once her sanctuary, her ordered, quiet refuge, became a labyrinth of impending doom, each familiar object transformed into a treacherous obstacle. As she stumbled and scrambled, her body a frantic, uncoordinated mess of limbs, the plush robe, already loose and unbelted, snagged on the overturned chair. With a tearing sound, a fabric cry of surrender, it ripped free from her shoulder, falling away in a heap on the polished floor, a discarded skin, leaving her utterly exposed.



Now, she ran in nothing but her lace panties, her body a pale, desperate flash against the deepening shadows of her home. Her natural, perky breasts, freed from the slight restraint of the robe, swung wildly with each panicked stride, two pale, bobbing targets, visibly jiggling and bouncing, pulling at the skin, against the gloom. The inverted nipples, once hidden secrets, were now exposed to the cold, predatory air, shriveling in the sudden, agonizing terror, like eyes retracting from a monstrous vision. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually so smooth and cool, was now slick with a sheen of desperate sweat, prickled with gooseflesh. She scrambled past the crystalline glass desk, her hand tearing at the sparse hair on her head, her fingers clamping, pulling, as if to rip the terror from her skull, past the inert laptop that had once anchored her days, now a silent, impotent observer of her final moments. She ran for the bathroom, the only true refuge, a small, enclosed space of porcelain and tile that promised, foolishly, escape from the nightmare that pursued her.



She slammed the bathroom door shut behind her, fumbling for the lock, her fingers slick with terror, desperately trying to find purchase on the smooth metal, her nails scraping against the cold brass. The wood groaned under the impact of his body, a desperate, shuddering protest, but it held, for a blessed, agonizing moment. She turned, her bare back pressed against the cold tiles, eyes wide, breath ragged, staring at the gleaming white bathtub. It was a porcelain maw, waiting, its clean lines mocking the chaos that had erupted, a pristine basin ready to receive her broken form.



The door splintered inward, ripped from its hinges by the force of his relentless entry, wood tearing with a sound like dying breath. He filled the doorway, a monstrous shadow, his form distorted by the dark fabric, the crude club raised high, silhouetted against the dim light of the hall, a cruel parody of an executioner. Amelia screamed again, a sound that tore from her lungs, pure, unadulterated horror, a final, primal cry of defiance, a desperate animal sound. She stumbled backward, tripping over her own feet, her legs tangling, falling heavily into the tub, the cold porcelain shocking her exposed skin, a chilling premonition of her tomb. Her body slumped, a broken doll, the lace of her panties a stark contrast against the white ceramic.



He was upon her instantly, a dark, heavy weight, a living shadow descending. The club descended. The first blow struck her chest, directly between her breasts, a sickening crack that echoed in the small, enclosed space, stealing her breath. A blinding agony bloomed, fiery and absolute, radiating outwards from her sternum, a burst of searing pain that momentarily eclipsed all other sensation. She choked, a strangled cry escaping her lips, her body convulsing, her breasts, now bruised and mottled, still trembled with the force of the impact, collapsing inward. The second blow landed on her ribcage, a dull, crushing impact that drove the remaining air from her lungs, forcing a ragged wheeze from her lips. She could feel the sharp edges of bone grating, tearing, a hideous symphony of destruction beneath her own skin. A hot, wet gush erupted in her mouth, metallic and coppery. Blood. It overflowed her lips, a crimson testament to the violation, running down her chin and neck.



The club rose and fell again, and again, a terrible, rhythmic punctuation to her dying gasps. Her head lolled, her vision blurring, the blank black ski mask above her swimming in a crimson haze, a swirling vortex of red and black. She felt a searing impact on her skull, then another, a deafening drumbeat of bone against blunt force, each one a final, annihilating declaration, crushing her very thoughts. Her limbs spasmodically, her body becoming a broken puppet, twitching, convulsing, no longer under her command. Blood blossomed like a terrible, dark flower around her, painting the pristine white of the tub in grotesque new hues, a tableau of crimson horror. Her screams were reduced to a gurgling wheeze, then silence, a silence more profound than any she had known. The blows continued, each one a final, annihilating declaration, long after the life had drained from her eyes, leaving her a broken, pulpy mass, forever entangled with the cold, gleaming porcelain. He stood over her, a dark monument to destruction, his silhouette filling the doorway, then turned and vanished back into the night, leaving the broken door, the shattered life, and the emerging, monstrous stillness.

The Awakening



The door swung inward with a faint, final click, revealing the interior of apartment 1413. The three men‚Äîthe two officers and Mr. Henderson‚Äîwere immediately assaulted by the full, unfiltered force of the smell. It was no longer a pervasive undercurrent; it was a physical blow, thick and choking, like breathing putrefied velvet. It cloyed at the back of their throats, burned their nostrils, and immediately settled in their stomachs, threatening to revolt. The air inside seemed heavier, stagnant, a tangible weight on their lungs.



The apartment itself was a tableau of interrupted existence, now long past. Dust motes, thick as velvet, danced in the shafts of light that pierced the gloom, illuminated by the officers' flashlights. The minimalist elegance from Amelia‚Äôs living photographs had devolved into a grim, unholy disarray. On the glass dining table, two plates sat, one with the fossilized remains of what might have been pasta, now a dark, crusted mass, mottled with grey and green fungi. Beside it, a single, overturned chair lay sprawled, a broken sentinel guarding the decay. A well-worn paperback, its spine cracked, lay open on the polished concrete floor beside it, its pages yellowed and warped, a silent witness to a scene of forgotten terror. Every surface was filmed with a thin, almost oily layer of grime, and the silence, absolute and profound, pressed in on them, far heavier than any sound.



The officers, grim-faced, moved slowly, their flashlights cutting swathes through the oppressive atmosphere. They followed the source of the stench, which intensified with each step, growing from an overpowering reek to a nauseating, undeniable assault. The black, viscous liquid, which had puzzled the building staff in the hallway, was now plainly visible as faint, dried trails on the polished concrete, leading directly towards the bathroom.



The bathroom door hung awkwardly from a single hinge, its wood splintered, a jagged, gaping wound in the otherwise pristine wall. The air in here was a noxious miasma, a concentrated distillation of the foulness from outside. The officer in the lead raised his flashlight, its beam cutting through the oppressive darkness, then he lowered it slowly, revealing the scene within.



The bathtub.



Amelia Finch lay within it, a grotesque parody of repose. Her body, or what remained of it, was a shriveled, blackened husk, reduced by the merciless march of time and decomposition. The once-plush robe was indistinguishable from the matted, dark mass that had once been her hair, clinging to the skeletal remains of her head. The delicate lace panties were gone, consumed by the relentless process. Her large, perky breasts were now flat, shrunken pouches of desiccated flesh, the nipples sunken into a dark, leathery areola, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding decay. The skin, meticulously shaved in life, was now taut and stretched over the sharp angles of bone, a leathery mummy. A dark, dried pool of viscous fluid, almost black, adhered to the bottom of the tub, staining the porcelain a permanent, unholy hue. It was not merely the smell of death, but the profound silence of a body long abandoned, dissolving back into the earth from which it came.



One of the officers gagged, clamping a hand over his mouth. The other, the lead, simply stared, his face ashen beneath the harsh beam of his flashlight. The scene spoke volumes of a terror unheeded, a death unmourned, and a life consumed by the very solitude it had embraced. This was not a fresh corpse; this was a relic of suffering. The police pathologist, called moments later, would confirm their silent horror: Amelia Finch had been dead for at least two months.



And then, the questions began to bloom, sharp and insidious, in the minds of the officers. How? How had the killer entered this sealed tomb? The front door, now hanging by a single hinge, had been secured not only by the changed mortise lock, but by a series of heavy-duty, manual deadbolts and chain locks, all engaged from the inside. The locksmith had struggled mightily, attesting to their formidable security. There was no fire escape, no precarious external staircase leading to the fourteenth floor. The apartment building stood alone, no other structure close enough for a jump or a precarious traverse. And the windows‚Äîsleek, modern, and expansive‚Äîwere immovably sealed, designed for insulation and climate control, offering no egress, no crack to the outside world. The officers exchanged baffled glances, their expressions shifting from grim discovery to profound unease. The killer had vanished without a trace, leaving behind a locked, impenetrable fortress, a perfect, horrifying enigma. It was as if the apartment itself had opened its maw to devour its victim, then sealed itself shut, leaving only the stench as a mocking testament to the horror within. The ordinary laws of ingress and egress seemed to have been utterly, irrevocably violated.



With a shared, unspoken understanding of the impossible, the officers retreated from the apartment's reeking interior. They returned with tools, not for investigation, but for containment. Heavy sheets of plywood were nailed across the broken door frame, crude planks of wood sealing the secrets within. ""Forensics will handle it,"" the lead officer muttered, more to himself than anyone, his voice hollow. ""Until then, nobody goes in. Nobody comes out."" The last nail hammered home, a brutal, final clang, sealing the mysteries of 1413 behind a raw, wooden barrier.



Meanwhile, Amelia Finch sat on her plush, minimalist couch. The reading lamp cast a warm, intimate glow over her. The faded pink robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a soft murmur against her skin. On her lap, a plate of pasta, steaming gently, sat beside a well-worn paperback. She took a slow, deliberate bite, her gaze fixed on the page, the quiet hum of the city a distant, comforting drone. She was alone, in her stylish apartment, utterly absorbed in her book, the silence her only companion. The world outside, its horrors and its mysteries, was a million miles away.",0,1749091963.0,scarystories,0,0.5,False

We were on a really good schedule, he would sleep around 7:30-8:00 pm and wake the following morning around 8:00 AM, and sometimes he would even sleep in until 9 AM. 

Now, he falls asleep around 8:30-9:00 PM and fights sleep the entire time. He also fights all of his daytime naps. He usually only has 2 daytime naps that are each around 1.5 to 2 hours. He is taking 15-30 min daytime naps, 1 to 2 times a day. No matter what I do he just becomes hyper as soon as I lay him down to breastfeed and sleep. He doesn't concentrate long enough to nurse effectively, and he jumps and wants to play, but as soon as he's out of the bedroom he wants to sleep again. Could it be the cup of coffee I'm drinking everyday? I recently started drinking Yerba Mate (traditional style, not canned), but only 1-2 times a week. Im not sure if this would be enough to affect his sleep for the past 2 weeks. 

He was recently teething but all 4 teeth have erupted. I also realize he's at an age where he needs more stimulation throughout the day, so we are taking more walks outside and playing a lot. 

Any ideas as to what could have caused this change? He's also started waking up with tons of energy multiple times a night and it takes hours to  get him back to sleep. 

Please any advice or ideas as to what is going on would really be appreciated. Thank you.",2,1749091852.0,cosleeping,0,1.0,False

At a time when most wellness solutions feel overwhelming or unsustainable, Java Burn offers a refreshing approach. By using trusted, well-studied ingredients to stimulate your body's own systems, it provides a clear, manageable way to support your health goals ‚Äî all starting with your favorite cup in the morning.

**How Java Burn Helps You Unlock Natural Fat-Burning Potential**

To understand what makes Java Burn stand out, it‚Äôs important to look at how your body processes energy. Your metabolic system is responsible for converting nutrients into fuel. However, with age, stress, and modern habits, this system tends to lose its efficiency ‚Äî resulting in weight retention and sluggishness. That‚Äôs where this unique coffee enhancer makes a real impact.

Java Burn is a neutral, dissolvable formula designed to be added to your daily brew. Once mixed with coffee, it initiates a warming response in the body that encourages calorie usage ‚Äî a biological mechanism that transforms stored fat into energy. When this thermal process is optimized, your body begins to work smarter, not harder, at burning fat, even during rest.

This morning ritual becomes even more powerful when consumed on an empty stomach, as Java Burn‚Äôs components are strategically chosen to maximize energy output and accelerate internal fat utilization. Unlike ordinary caffeine, the ingredients in this blend work together to elevate your system‚Äôs ability to use fat as a primary fuel source ‚Äî helping to support long-lasting energy and more efficient metabolism throughout the day.

Java Burn‚Äôs formula includes a carefully selected combination of supportive compounds that assist the body‚Äôs natural ability to manage weight and enhance endurance. Here‚Äôs how each plays its part:

**- Antioxidant-Rich Green Tea Concentrate**  
This extract, derived from green tea leaves, helps stimulate the body's natural calorie-burning process. It activates a special type of fat cell responsible for turning stored fat into usable energy and supports better sugar balance, which is key in preventing new fat accumulation.

**- Plant-Based Chlorogenic Compound**  
Extracted from raw coffee beans, this element plays a role in managing how your body processes sugar and carbohydrates. It encourages the body to use incoming calories for immediate fuel rather than storing them. It also provides a layer of cellular protection, guarding against metabolic wear and tear.

**- L-Carnitine Fuel Transporter**  
This amino acid derivative plays a critical role in delivering fatty acids to the energy centers of your cells. Once there, they are burned for fuel. This makes it easier for the body to tap into existing fat stores, especially during mentally or physically demanding times.

**- Trace Mineral Chromium**  
Known for its role in maintaining sugar stability, this mineral helps balance energy levels and reduces the highs and lows that often lead to sudden cravings. It also helps your body better process carbohydrates, ensuring fewer are converted into fat.

By leveraging these ingredients, Java Burn turns an everyday habit into a strategic wellness boost. Instead of relying on complex diets or intense training routines, this formula supports your body in working more efficiently ‚Äî all while you enjoy your morning coffee.

It‚Äôs not about shortcuts or unrealistic promises. Java Burn offers a consistent, natural way to support your energy and fat metabolism ‚Äî designed to help you feel better, stay focused, and manage your weight without disrupting your lifestyle.

In a world saturated with weight loss fads, quick fixes, and contradicting health advice, finding a safe and effective solution can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.¬†That‚Äôs where¬†**Java Burn**¬†enters the spotlight¬†‚Äî a groundbreaking natural coffee additive that transforms your ordinary cup into a metabolism-enhancing powerhouse.

Touted as the first and only 100% natural, flavorless supplement specifically crafted to be mixed with coffee, Java Burn is designed to accelerate fat loss, increase daily energy, and curb appetite ‚Äî all without the crash commonly associated with conventional stimulants. Just one stick of Java Burn in your morning coffee can help turn your daily habit into a science-supported, fat-burning ritual.

This thermogenic blend works in harmony with coffee‚Äôs caffeine content to ignite your body's metabolic furnace. With thousands of users embracing this simple yet strategic weight loss approach, Java Burn is quickly becoming a go-to solution for those seeking sustainable results with minimal lifestyle disruption.

In this in-depth review, we‚Äôll break down how Java Burn works, examine its clinically supported ingredients, highlight real user feedback, and compare it with other popular metabolism-boosting beverages. Whether your goal is fat loss, enhanced energy, or a healthier coffee habit, this guide will help you discover whether Java Burn is the smart addition your wellness routine needs.

**Breaking the Cycle: Why Sustainable Weight Management Feels Out of Reach ‚Äî And How Java Burn Could Help**

In our hyper-connected, always-on world, the journey to healthy weight management has become more complicated than ever. Despite a flood of weight loss solutions ‚Äî from trendy diets and calorie tracking apps to gym memberships and miracle supplements ‚Äî obesity rates are on the rise, and millions are still battling low energy, stalled progress, and mounting frustration.

The reality? Weight struggles often have little to do with motivation or discipline. Instead, they're deeply tied to biological shifts like slowed metabolism, hormonal imbalances, and chronic stress ‚Äî factors that most mainstream programs fail to address. For many, it‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre doing things wrong ‚Äî it‚Äôs that their body isn‚Äôt responding the way this used to.

As time passes, the body naturally undergoes changes that impact how efficiently it utilizes fuel. What used to be an effortless process of burning off extra calories now slows considerably. You may find that your physique begins to change even if your eating patterns and movement habits remain relatively consistent. The body begins holding on to extra fat, and recovering from physical activity becomes noticeably harder.

Compounding the issue is the modern lifestyle ‚Äî long hours spent sitting, a heavy reliance on packaged meals, restless nights, and the never-ending pressures of daily responsibilities. These factors disturb the body's internal balance and make it harder to maintain a lean, energized state.

In an attempt to break free from this rut, many reach for quick-energy beverages or stimulant-heavy formulas. While they might provide an initial jolt, they often lead to unease, shaky hands, or exhaustion shortly after. Others go to extremes with overly strict food plans or artificial solutions, only to be met with minimal and short-lived changes.

What‚Äôs truly needed is a natural ally that aligns with your body‚Äôs built-in rhythms ‚Äî not another drastic overhaul. That‚Äôs where¬†**Java Burn**¬†makes its mark.

It's late so I'm particularly vulnerable to late night purchases. I'm in that bad demographic that is a tobacco smoker, overweight, and shopping addict. I quit drinking alcohol 20 years ago but I'm a major decaffeinated coffee drinker and that's getting pretty expensive too. I don't like drinking cold stuff so it'd be hard to quit that. I did buy several types of tea last week to have when I quit smoking.

I just think my time is better spent trying to improve myself instead of shopping. But I know it'll be tough. Have any of you successfully conquered any other addictions?",5,1749091395.0,shoppingaddiction,5,1.0,False

It targets the underlying factors that often block progress ‚Äî such as slowed energy use, inefficient digestion of nutrients, and inconsistent stamina.

What makes Java Burn different is its simplicity. There's no special regimen to follow, no complicated schedules ‚Äî just a small enhancement to something you already enjoy daily.

At a time when most wellness solutions feel overwhelming or unsustainable, Java Burn offers a refreshing approach. By using trusted, well-studied ingredients to stimulate your body's own systems, it provides a clear, manageable way to support your health goals ‚Äî all starting with your favorite cup in the morning.

**How Java Burn Helps You Unlock Natural Fat-Burning Potential**

To understand what makes Java Burn stand out, it‚Äôs important to look at how your body processes energy. Your metabolic system is responsible for converting nutrients into fuel. However, with age, stress, and modern habits, this system tends to lose its efficiency ‚Äî resulting in weight retention and sluggishness. That‚Äôs where this unique coffee enhancer makes a real impact.

Java Burn is a neutral, dissolvable formula designed to be added to your daily brew. Once mixed with coffee, it initiates a warming response in the body that encourages calorie usage ‚Äî a biological mechanism that transforms stored fat into energy. When this thermal process is optimized, your body begins to work smarter, not harder, at burning fat, even during rest.

This morning ritual becomes even more powerful when consumed on an empty stomach, as Java Burn‚Äôs components are strategically chosen to maximize energy output and accelerate internal fat utilization. Unlike ordinary caffeine, the ingredients in this blend work together to elevate your system‚Äôs ability to use fat as a primary fuel source ‚Äî helping to support long-lasting energy and more efficient metabolism throughout the day.

Java Burn‚Äôs formula includes a carefully selected combination of supportive compounds that assist the body‚Äôs natural ability to manage weight and enhance endurance. Here‚Äôs how each plays its part:

**- Antioxidant-Rich Green Tea Concentrate**  
This extract, derived from green tea leaves, helps stimulate the body's natural calorie-burning process. It activates a special type of fat cell responsible for turning stored fat into usable energy and supports better sugar balance, which is key in preventing new fat accumulation.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://b21194lgpa-55m5heffx9ouvcm.hop.clickbank.net/?&tid=ai0svut)

**- Plant-Based Chlorogenic Compound**  
Extracted from raw coffee beans, this element plays a role in managing how your body processes sugar and carbohydrates. It encourages the body to use incoming calories for immediate fuel rather than storing them. It also provides a layer of cellular protection, guarding against metabolic wear and tear.

**- L-Carnitine Fuel Transporter**  
This amino acid derivative plays a critical role in delivering fatty acids to the energy centers of your cells. Once there, they are burned for fuel. This makes it easier for the body to tap into existing fat stores, especially during mentally or physically demanding times.

**- Trace Mineral Chromium**  
Known for its role in maintaining sugar stability, this mineral helps balance energy levels and reduces the highs and lows that often lead to sudden cravings. It also helps your body better process carbohydrates, ensuring fewer are converted into fat.

By leveraging these ingredients, Java Burn turns an everyday habit into a strategic wellness boost. Instead of relying on complex diets or intense training routines, this formula supports your body in working more efficiently ‚Äî all while you enjoy your morning coffee.

It‚Äôs not about shortcuts or unrealistic promises. Java Burn offers a consistent, natural way to support your energy and fat metabolism ‚Äî designed to help you feel better, stay focused, and manage your weight without disrupting your lifestyle.

In a world saturated with weight loss fads, quick fixes, and contradicting health advice, finding a safe and effective solution can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.¬†That‚Äôs where¬†**Java Burn**¬†enters the spotlight¬†‚Äî a groundbreaking natural coffee additive that transforms your ordinary cup into a metabolism-enhancing powerhouse.

Touted as the first and only 100% natural, flavorless supplement specifically crafted to be mixed with coffee, Java Burn is designed to accelerate fat loss, increase daily energy, and curb appetite ‚Äî all without the crash commonly associated with conventional stimulants. Just one stick of Java Burn in your morning coffee can help turn your daily habit into a science-supported, fat-burning ritual.

This thermogenic blend works in harmony with coffee‚Äôs caffeine content to ignite your body's metabolic furnace. With thousands of users embracing this simple yet strategic weight loss approach, Java Burn is quickly becoming a go-to solution for those seeking sustainable results with minimal lifestyle disruption.

In this in-depth review, we‚Äôll break down how Java Burn works, examine its clinically supported ingredients, highlight real user feedback, and compare it with other popular metabolism-boosting beverages. Whether your goal is fat loss, enhanced energy, or a healthier coffee habit, this guide will help you discover whether Java Burn is the smart addition your wellness routine needs.

**Breaking the Cycle: Why Sustainable Weight Management Feels Out of Reach ‚Äî And How Java Burn Could Help**

In our hyper-connected, always-on world, the journey to healthy weight management has become more complicated than ever. Despite a flood of weight loss solutions ‚Äî from trendy diets and calorie tracking apps to gym memberships and miracle supplements ‚Äî obesity rates are on the rise, and millions are still battling low energy, stalled progress, and mounting frustration.

The reality? Weight struggles often have little to do with motivation or discipline. Instead, they're deeply tied to biological shifts like slowed metabolism, hormonal imbalances, and chronic stress ‚Äî factors that most mainstream programs fail to address. For many, it‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre doing things wrong ‚Äî it‚Äôs that their body isn‚Äôt responding the way this used to.

As time passes, the body naturally undergoes changes that impact how efficiently it utilizes fuel. What used to be an effortless process of burning off extra calories now slows considerably. You may find that your physique begins to change even if your eating patterns and movement habits remain relatively consistent. The body begins holding on to extra fat, and recovering from physical activity becomes noticeably harder.

Compounding the issue is the modern lifestyle ‚Äî long hours spent sitting, a heavy reliance on packaged meals, restless nights, and the never-ending pressures of daily responsibilities. These factors disturb the body's internal balance and make it harder to maintain a lean, energized state.

In an attempt to break free from this rut, many reach for quick-energy beverages or stimulant-heavy formulas. While they might provide an initial jolt, they often lead to unease, shaky hands, or exhaustion shortly after. Others go to extremes with overly strict food plans or artificial solutions, only to be met with minimal and short-lived changes.

What‚Äôs truly needed is a natural ally that aligns with your body‚Äôs built-in rhythms ‚Äî not another drastic overhaul. That‚Äôs where¬†**Java Burn**¬†makes its mark. Instead of forcing radical lifestyle changes, it quietly complements your current habits ‚Äî particularly your morning brew.",1,1749091377.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

I was at a Pride event in my state this week, I had the troops up by 7am to drive down for our whole day. I got a hotel, had our coffee ready to go, the whole shebang 

The day went perfectly 
Started the party early, was drinking all around a beach and got a lot of love from others on my fit~ 

I have never had a night a club where I‚Äôve ended up making out with a stranger but alas, we‚Äôve done it 

It was after midnight, dancing in this awesome gay club when this attractive, semi older fellow(mid 40‚Äôs? For context I am 26) came into the mix and sure as shit I guess it started happening

I wish I could remember more of it bc it comes in and out of memory , right up until the lights came on lmao. But I remember being touched how I wanted and definitely gave him a show haha 

I‚Äôll never see that man again but thanks for making me feel like the hot gay man I‚Äôve always known I could be x 


Ps There was a fine ass man on this rooftop bar that was interested in me and I totally blew it bc I was a little lit and so focused on getting back to my friends that I just answered his question and left lmao 

Being caught off guard when you‚Äôre not used to such fun attention is both thrilling and unfortunate bc I always leave the conversation like FUCK I could‚Äôve gotten free drinks ",18,1749091250.0,ftm,1,0.91,False

The key is to build a portfolio that screams professionalism‚Äîand charge accordingly\.

But this isn‚Äôt about churning out generic fluff\. It‚Äôs about delivering value\. Clients want clarity\, creativity\, and consistency\. If you can master those three C‚Äôs\, you‚Äôll never have to worry about the next paycheck\.

### Web Development and Tech Consulting

In a world driven by code\, web developers are the architects of opportunity\. They build e\-commerce sites\, landing pages\, and custom applications that help businesses scale\. For digital nomads\, this means access to high\-paying gigs from anywhere with an internet connection\.

Marketing is the art of persuasion\. In the digital realm\, it‚Äôs also a science\. Digital marketers use data\, algorithms\, and psychology to drive traffic\, boost sales\, and grow brands\. For nomads\, this is a goldmine\. You don‚Äôt need a team or an office‚Äîyou just need a laptop and a brain full of strategies\.

From social media campaigns to email marketing funnels\, the possibilities are endless\. You could be managing ad accounts in Singapore while sipping coffee in Chiang Mai\. The beauty of this field is its scalability\. One campaign can reach millions\. One strategy can change everything\.

But here‚Äôs the catch\: you have to be relentless\. You have to test\, analyze\, and adapt faster than your competition\. And you have to deliver results\. That‚Äôs the only language that matters in this game\.

### Graphic Design and Visual Storytelling

Visuals speak louder than words\. A single image can convey emotion\, tell a story\, or sell a product\. Graphic designers are the silent influencers of the digital world\. They create logos\, banners\, infographics\, and more\. And they get paid handsomely for it\.

For nomads\, graphic design is a dream profession\. You can work from anywhere\, set your own hours\, and choose your clients\. The challenge is standing out in a crowded market\. You need a unique style\, a strong portfolio\, and the ability to understand your client‚Äôs vision\.

And let‚Äôs not forget private tutoring\. Many digital nomads offer one\-on\-one lessons in languages\, math\, or music\. It‚Äôs flexible\, lucrative\, and deeply rewarding\. Plus\, you get to watch your students grow while you travel the world\.

### E\-commerce and Dropshipping

Entrepreneurship meets mobility in the world of e\-commerce\. Dropshipping allows you to run a business without holding inventory\. You partner with suppliers who handle the logistics while you focus on branding\, marketing\, and customer service\.

This model is ideal for nomads because it requires minimal overhead and maximum agility\. You can start small\, test different niches\, and scale as you go\. The key is finding a product that solves a problem and resonates with your audience\.

But dropshipping isn‚Äôt a get\-rich\-quick scheme\. It demands discipline\, patience\, and persistence\. You‚Äôll face challenges‚Äîsupply chain issues\, customer complaints\, and algorithm updates\. But if you‚Äôre willing to put in the work\, the payoff is huge\.

The secret to success lies in niche selection and audience trust\. Choose a product you believe in\, and build a community around it\. Whether it‚Äôs through blogs\, YouTube\, or Instagram\, your goal is to provide value and drive action\.

Once you‚Äôve established a system\, the income compounds\. More traffic means more commissions\. More followers mean more influence\. And more influence means more opportunities\.

Software engineers build the backbone of this ecosystem\. They write code\, debug systems\, and deploy solutions that power the digital world\. With the right skills\, you can land remote jobs at top\-tier companies or start your own venture\.

But this isn‚Äôt for everyone\. You need to be technically proficient\, detail\-oriented\, and constantly learning\. The tech landscape evolves rapidly\, and staying relevant is essential\. However\, for those who thrive in this environment\, the rewards are limitless\.

### Photography and Videography as a Nomadic Profession

Images capture moments\. They tell stories\. They sell dreams\. For digital nomads\, photography and videography are both a passion and a profession\. Whether you shoot stock photos\, create travel vlogs\, or produce branded content\, your visuals can generate income\.

Plus\, the beauty of this field is its versatility\. You can work as a freelancer\, start a YouTube channel\, or even launch your own brand\. The sky‚Äôs the limit‚Äîif you‚Äôre willing to take the shot\.

$1300 just on coffee, over $6000 on Amazon of which easily 80% was shit I didn't actually need, probably $1000 on takeout because I was too lazy to cook, guesstimating about \~$1500 overspent at the grocery on fancy crackers and artisan pickles that I didn't need, and about $200 in useless subscriptions.

Like the radio blaring through heavy traffic, its static crackling in the claustrophobic silence. I won‚Äôt have to listen to my dad‚Äôs complaints about it anymore. Outside the window, the cars inch forward in a sluggish crawl, the city‚Äôs skyline fading behind us. My mom sits beside me, her voice almost a whisper as she hums along, forcing herself to sing‚Äîprobably to drown out the memories of my dad‚Äôs constant silence. Tommy, my little brother, is in the back, fingers flying over the screen playing Roblox, oblivious to the weight of everything. He‚Äôs just about to turn nine, still trying to grasp why Mom and Dad aren‚Äôt together anymore. I don‚Äôt want to spoil his innocence with my own worries. As we edge closer to the outskirts of town, I notice Mom‚Äôs nose scrunching and her hands tightening on the wheel, her knuckles white. This move‚Äîthis new start‚Äîit's a hard road for anyone, especially her.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your charger?‚Äù Tommy asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in one of the boxes in the trunk, I think,‚Äù I replied. You would‚Äôve thought I just hurt a dog in front of Tommy the way he reacted.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhy are we moving so far from Dad?! Is he coming with us later?‚Äù Tommy screamed.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNo honey, your dad and I love you very much, but we‚Äôre having a difficult time right now,‚Äù my mom tried to comfort Tommy.¬†¬†

As Tommy was sniffing his tears away, I reached in my pocket and gave him a Chief Wahoo pin. My dad loves Cleveland baseball, and he would always take Tommy to the games. I wish just once he would take me. Giving Tommy that pin reminded him of Dad and brought him just enough comfort to pull himself together.¬†¬†

We‚Äôve been driving for thirty minutes and haven‚Äôt seen a single restaurant or grocery store‚Äîjust a Dollar General and deer crossing signs. That‚Äôs what most of Ohio consisted of outside of the city.¬†¬†

Finally, we pull into our new home, surrounded by woods. It‚Äôs nothing fancy, just a humble three-bedroom, two-story house. We stretch as we get out of the car and just stand, staring, in silence.¬†¬†

Mom broke the silence by saying, ‚ÄúC'mon boys! Let's see your new rooms!‚Äù¬†¬†

It was nice to think that I was finally going to have my own room. Tommy and I had to share a room, and most of the time share a bed. Not because we only had one bed, but because sometimes we heard Mom and Dad fighting, and Tommy would be scared and slip into my bed while I was sleeping.¬†¬†

Breaking free of the trance, I shake my head and grab my bag from the car. I pat Tommy on the back, and we make our way up the old wooden porch. From what I was guessing, I would say this house was built in the 60s‚Äîbased on the house‚Äôs chipping paint, creaky wooden porch, and vintage window curtains. But again, I‚Äôm excited for this new chapter. Well, not really excited, but intrigued.¬†¬†

When Mom finally pushed open the front door, I braced myself for chaos‚Äîbroken furniture, trash strewn across the floor, signs of a hurried abandonment. Instead, I was met with an unnerving stillness. The house felt frozen in time, as if the owners had simply disappeared, leaving everything exactly as it was‚Äîfurniture draped in ghostly layers of dust, curtains hanging limp and yellowed, swaying faintly as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. The stale air clung to my skin, thick with the scent of neglect and forgotten memories. Every step I took echoed unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence, like the house was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I help Tommy with his bags as he runs upstairs to see his new room. I throw mine over my shoulder and head up the stairs.¬†*Pop-ching! Pop-ching!*¬†I freeze. These steps‚Äîthey don‚Äôt even creek when I step on them. They‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôve never heard steps that make that noise.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shout. ‚ÄúWatch what happens when I walk on these steps.‚Äù¬†¬†

*Pop-ching!*¬†As I put my weight on the first step.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHuh, that‚Äôs unique!‚Äù My mom then turns away to continue unpacking boxes. I have a feeling that bothers her too, but she‚Äôs trying to stay positive. So I don‚Äôt say anything either‚ÄîI‚Äôll just have to put up with the odd noise. I‚Äôll have to figure out another way to sneak out at night.¬†¬†

I reach the top of the stairs to see one single hallway where all three bedroom doors meet. I enter the first one to see Tommy looking out the window.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey buddy, wanna help me unpack your games?‚Äù I ask him.¬†¬†

But he‚Äôs just staring out the window.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTommy?‚Äù I ask again.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOh, sorry, I was looking at that old barn out there,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúThe old barn?‚Äù I look outside to see a leaning wooden barn, about half the size of the house. ‚ÄúMaybe we can check it out after we unpack.‚Äù I say, trying to get Tommy to help me.¬†¬†

Like a conductor on stage, Tommy told me where and how exactly he wanted his toys‚Äîhow to face them and what position they should be in.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMy pin!‚Äù Tommy yelled as he frantically checked his pockets.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll find it. You just had it; it can‚Äôt be far,‚Äù I reassured him.¬†¬†

After scouring his room, I figured it was in the car, when I gave it to him. I walk down the¬†*unique*¬†stairs and go outside. I open the rear passenger door and see it on the floor.¬†¬†

As I close the door, Tommy yells from my bedroom window, ‚ÄúWas it there?!‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúGo Indians!‚Äù I jokingly say as I lift up the pin.¬†¬†

Suddenly, a faint voice sliced through the silence‚Äîdistorted, broken, like a record scratched beyond repair. It was close enough to make my skin crawl, yet distant enough to be dismissed as a neighbor. But I knew better. The voice was warped, fragments of words drifting in and out, echoing with unnatural echo. My mind spun, trying to find sense in the fractured sounds. ‚ÄòDid we even have neighbors?‚Äô I wondered, trembling. ‚ÄòOr is something else here‚Äîsomething that shouldn‚Äôt be?‚Äô The voice‚Äôs strange, broken cadence sent icy shivers down my spine, each word a jagged shard of a nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake from.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou moved my bed wrong.‚Äù Tommy instructed me from my bedroom, which broke me out of my deep thoughts.

‚ÄúGet out of my room.‚Äù I plainly say as I walk inside.¬†¬†

Nothing was in my room; I was just tired of getting bossed around by an almost nine-year-old.



The first night passed, and now the house had a mix of the old furniture from the previous owner and the items we brought. Mom is very happy that she doesn‚Äôt have to buy new couches or lamps, since I know she can‚Äôt afford them.¬†¬†

I decided to crash on the old couch, as I didn‚Äôt get a full night‚Äôs rest. I woke up last night with Tommy asking if he could sleep with me. The old springs groaned loudly beneath me as I plummeted onto the sagging couch, its rusted coils protesting with a squeal.

We really didn‚Äôt bring much furniture‚Äîsince we didn‚Äôt have any‚Äîbut one thing we did bring was the TV. I turned on¬†*The Sopranos*, and before I knew it, I was extremely tired.¬†¬†

I woke up to see Cleveland Baseball on the TV, but Tommy was nowhere to be found. Annoyed, I get up and look for Tommy.¬†*Pop-ching! Pop-ching! Pop-ching!*¬†as I run up the stairs.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to change the channel, at least be there to watch it!‚Äù I yell as I turn the corner into Tommy‚Äôs room. But he‚Äôs not there.¬†¬†

I walk up to his window and look out into the backyard, where I see him just as he enters the barn. Curious about what Tommy was doing, I head downstairs so I can follow him. I exit the front door and slowly start to make my way to the backyard. At this point, I realize that I never took in the surroundings outside of the house. I glance at the peeling siding and chipped paint, but I don't look at it with disgust. I'm almost in awe that the outside of the house is basically falling apart, yet we find the inside untouched.

*BAM!*¬†‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî?‚Äù As I was looking at the house, I seemed to run into an old dog house. Just like the outside of our home, the dog house has seen better days. It has white siding and a red-painted roof, which is chipping. Right above the entrance, I see a painted-on bone with a name written on it. ‚ÄúSamson,‚Äù I mumble under my breath. No sign of any dog here.

I pick up my pace and jog to the barn. I stop before walking through the open doors of the barn to appreciate how it's still standing, even though it has an impressive lean. ‚ÄúTommy?‚Äù I nervously ask. With no response, I enter the barn. The rusty tools clink softly as I brush past them, their jagged edges catching what little light filtered in. The air inside the barn was thick with the scent of mold, old hay, and decay. I could feel the rough, cold wood of the beams beneath my fingertips and hear the distant drip of water echoing through the stale silence. Straw covers the ground, and there are soggy bales of hay that look like they were placed 40 years ago. A drip of water falls on the bridge of my nose, startling me. I look up to see more sky than roof.

""Tommy, seriously, come on."" My voice edged with impatience as I scanned the barn. Two horse stalls sit against the weathered wood, the first one creaking softly. I hear a faint rustling from inside. ""Dude,"" I say, more sharply now, stepping closer. The gate is closed, but the wood has been rotted thin, gaps opening like broken teeth. I lean in, squinting. There‚Äîan eye glints back at me through the cracks. My stomach tightens. I jump back, slipping on the damp hay sprawled across the ground, and stumble onto the dirt.

I hear a burst of laughter, It‚Äôs Tommy, pushing open the gate with a grin. I glare at him, trying to catch my breath.

""Yeah, real funny,"" I mutter, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou told me to come in here! I heard you call me out here, but I couldn't find you, so I thought we were playing a game. Remember when you said we could explore the barn after we put my things away?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah, I guess I did say that,‚Äù I replied. I rub my eyes and head, feeling a mix of confusion and the aftereffects of the fall.

‚ÄúC'mon, let's go inside,‚Äù I say as I rub his back.

‚ÄúWanna watch baseball with me, Jonathan?!‚Äù Tommy asked me eagerly.

‚ÄúSure, buddy.‚Äù I replied.



The room was cloaked in darkness, the only sound was my steady breathing and the TV commercials. Despite the silence, a strange comfort washed over me‚Äîthis rare quiet, broken only by distant creaks and the whisper of the wind outside, made me feel like I was finally alone in this haunted place. It's only the second week of being here‚Äîin our new house, in our new life. Not surprisingly, baseball is on the TV. It's not even a live game; it's a rerun. Just having the game on in the background reminds Tommy of Dad. Tommy never saw the side of Dad I saw. He only saw the side that took him to games and bought him a hotdog.

I sit in the old recliner in the living room, next to the couch. I look into the kitchen and see the back door, and notice something odd about it. The back door was a fortress‚Äîno window to see outside, just three heavy locks securing it. The thick, dark wood seemed to absorb the moonlight, leaving the house feeling more like a prison than a home. I wondered who had built it like this‚Äîwhat secrets did those locks hide? Now that I notice that, I realize there are no windows on the ground floor. But who knows what they were thinking when they built this house in the '60s. Maybe it had something to do with the Cold War.

I relax as I watch the rerun alone. Mom was asleep after a long day of work, and Tommy was in his room doing who knows what. What I was most excited about in our new lives was the quiet. You‚Äôd be surprised how stressful it was, living all together‚Äîlistening to Dad try to sneak out with his latest woman, slipping through the kitchen like a thief, while Mom yelled at him from the front door. Sometimes, it was a guy. Over time, you stop reacting. You go numb. Mom fell into that same trap. But thankfully, my aunt helped her break free.

I jolt upright from the chair, gasping, sweat sticking to my skin. I must‚Äôve dozed off. The TV flickers with an old shopping commercial; I switch it off and stand. As I turn toward the stairs, I catch it‚Äîa muffled voice, faint but strange: ‚ÄúWatchhhhhh‚Ä¶ baseball?‚Äù My heart skips. I freeze. That‚Äôs Tommy outside, right? But it doesn‚Äôt sound like him. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs learning to talk again‚Äîmumbling, uncertain, almost like a toddler. I rub my eyes, trying to shake the fog. But I can‚Äôt go check the window‚Äîthere are no windows here.

I wait and wait, but nothing happens. ‚ÄúMaybe Tommy was sleep talking? Or it was still part of my dream,‚Äù I ask myself in my head. I finally decide to head up to my room, so I turn around and go up the stairs. Damn, I totally forgot that we have¬†*unique*¬†stairs. I'll have to try my best to be as quiet and light as possible when I take these steps. I carefully place my foot on the first step.¬†*Pop-ching!*¬†The sound rings out sharply in the silence. My stomach tightens. I freeze, holding my breath. The noise echoes unnaturally loud. I quickly shift my weight against the wall, trying to muffle the sound, but the¬†*Pop-ching!*¬†repeats, each step feeling heavier with dread.

‚ÄúHello? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Mom‚Äôs voice is groggy, fogged with exhaustion.

I hang my head, feeling defeated. ‚ÄúSorry, Mom‚ÄîI fell asleep downstairs. Just... tired.‚Äù I hate robbing her of the little sleep she gets lately.

She offers a faint, tired smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, honey. I‚Äôll see you in the morning.‚Äù¬†¬†

I force a faint smile and hurriedly climb the creaky stairs.¬†*Pop-ching! Pop-ching!*¬†Each step sounds like a scream in the silent house. I grit my teeth. ‚ÄúWhy do these stupid stairs sing every time I step on them?‚Äù I mutter, my voice edged with irritation.¬† I stumble into my room and collapse onto the bed. The only light filters in through the window‚Äîan icy blue glow from the moon. My body aches from exhaustion, but a faint shiver still runs down my spine from that dream‚ÄîTommy‚Äôs voice echoing strange and distorted. I sit up stiffly, pulling the curtains closed, shutting out the darkness and trying to shake off the unease.



It‚Äôs been a month since we moved, and today marks the day Tommy‚Äôs been counting down to since we arrived. The day Dad finally takes him to a Cleveland Indians game. From the moment the sun rose, Tommy‚Äôs been bursting with energy‚Äîwearing his Indians jersey and cap, talking nonstop about the game like it‚Äôs the biggest event of his life. Meanwhile, I feel a quiet knot in my stomach‚Äîthis is the day Mom‚Äôs least looked forward to: seeing her ex-husband again.

I don‚Äôt feel much about Dad‚Äîno anger, no warmth. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a stranger I pass in the hall. And I‚Äôm pretty sure he feels the same. But if Tommy‚Äôs smile can be because of him, then maybe that‚Äôs enough. I slip into the kitchen, peeking around the corner just enough to hear Mom talking softly on the phone. Her voice is calm, but I catch certain words‚Äîher mentioning a date with her ex. I stop, pressing my back against the wall, trying not to make a sound. It‚Äôs almost shocking‚Äîonly a month out of love, and she‚Äôs already talking about dating again? Or maybe she‚Äôd fallen out of love long before she left him. The thought stings, sharper than I expected.

I step outside with Tommy, tossing the ball back and forth beneath the fading late-afternoon sky. The yard is quiet, save for the occasional laugh or thud of the ball. About fifteen minutes in, a strange voice cuts through the stillness: ‚ÄúSamson? Where areee...?‚Äù The words are drawn out, distorted, like they‚Äôre coming from far away, then abruptly cut off with a scratchy, static-like noise.¬†

As I turn to face where the voice came from, the ball hits me in the back of the neck, startling me and breaking the moment.¬†

‚ÄúSorry, Johnathan!‚Äù Tommy yells, his face pale with worry.¬†¬†

I rub the spot where the ball hit, grimacing. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I say, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúI thought we didn‚Äôt have neighbors around here.‚Äù¬†

Tommy tilts his head, eyes wide. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre looking for their dog?‚Äù he suggests softly, voice tentative.¬†¬†

I glance in the direction where the old, weathered dog house sits in shadow. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old dog house back there,‚Äù I murmur, more to myself than him. A chill runs down my spine.¬†¬†

Tommy hesitates, then asks quietly, ‚ÄúShould we go check?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, let‚Äôs go inside,‚Äù I say quickly. I lock the door behind us, the click echoing in the quiet house. The air feels heavier now, shadows stretching across the walls. I flick on the TV, tuning into the game, trying to drown out the strange feeling crawling up my spine. Tommy plops onto the couch, eyes fixed on the screen, while I listen to Mom upstairs‚Äîstill on the phone, her muffled voice drifting down.

I lean closer, catching snippets of her muffled voice upstairs. ‚ÄúI know! Maybe Pink?‚Äù she whispers, her tone tentative.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, you know...‚Äù she trails off, voice lowering to a whisper I can barely hear.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe did have that thing‚Äîwhat, nine years ago?‚Äù The words hang in the air, strange and out of place. My stomach tightens. What are they talking about?¬†¬†

My heart leaps as Tommy suddenly appears beside me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs nine years ago?‚Äù he asks innocently, but there‚Äôs a hint of curiosity I don‚Äôt like.¬†¬†

I startle, turning sharply. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? I thought you were watching the game,‚Äù I say, voice tight. Without thinking, I gently but firmly push him onto the couch, trying to mask my rising unease.

I hear the gravel beneath the driveway crunch loudly as a figure appears. Tommy‚Äôs eyes widened with anticipation. Without hesitation, he bolts outside, sprinting toward the battered Chevy parked at the edge of the yard.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù Tommy shouts, voice full of excitement.

Dad steps out of the car, a wide grin spreading across his face. ‚ÄúTommy, my man! How‚Äôs my little buddy?‚Äù he calls, opening his arms.¬†¬†

Tommy charges forward, launching himself into a hug. Dad ruffles his hair affectionately, a fleeting smile touching his lips‚Äîthough I notice a flicker of something guarded in his eyes.

Dad approaches cautiously, voice hesitant. ‚ÄúHey, Johnathan. How‚Äôs the new house treating you?‚Äù¬†¬†

I shrug, trying to keep my tone neutral. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù¬†¬†

He glances toward the house, then asks softly, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your mom?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúUpstairs,‚Äù I reply. He hesitates, then just settles onto the porch steps, watching the house but not going inside.

Suddenly, Dad raises his voice, calling out, ‚ÄúHeather! Heather! Come here!‚Äù His tone is casual but urgent, almost like he‚Äôs calling a lost dog.¬†¬†

From upstairs, I hear Mom‚Äôs voice, soft but wary. ‚ÄúJohn, what is it?‚Äù she calls, peeking around the doorframe.¬†¬†

Dad gestures impatiently. ‚ÄúCome here! Let me see you,‚Äù he insists, voice firm but strained.

‚ÄúBring him back before dark, please. We don‚Äôt have any street lamps down here,‚Äù Mom says sharply, turning away and heading upstairs.¬†¬†

Dad mutters, ‚ÄúWhat a dump,‚Äù under his breath, then grabs Tommy by the shoulders. They climb into the battered sedan, and as they drive away, I catch Tommy waving at me through the window, a bright smile on his face. I raise my hand in return, forcing a smile of my own. But as soon as the car disappears down the road, that smile slips away, replaced by a heavy silence inside me.

Inside, I find Mom at the dining table, sweeping crumbs into a dustpan. I hesitate, then speak. ‚ÄúMom, we heard that voice outside. It was weird‚Äîkind of scratchy, like it was far away but close at the same time.‚Äù¬†¬†

She looks up, brushing her hair back. ‚ÄúMaybe it was just some hikers passing by. Could you put this box of your school papers downstairs?‚Äù she asks, her tone trying to sound casual but distracted.

As I descend into the basement, an eerie silence replaces the usual creaks and groans of the old stairs. These steps are older, more fragile, and strangely quiet‚Äîalmost unnerving. I set the box down in a convenient corner, then turn back.¬†¬†

Jackpot. An old cardboard box with ‚ÄúMemorabilia‚Äù written in Sharpie across the top. I sift through it, finding faded photographs and a few worn diaries. I pull out one, flipping through the pages‚Äînothing exciting, just scribbles and memories. Since I left my PS4 at Dad‚Äôs, this will have to do for passing the time.

I climb back up the creaking stairs, glancing at the quiet, aged steps. Something about them bugs me‚Äîtheir silence, the way they seem so different from the loud, protesting steps I remember. I decide to figure out why the stairs going upstairs are so loud. I toss the diary onto the rickety coffee table, then head toward the small closet beneath the stairs. No light inside‚Äîjust darkness. I fumble for my flashlight, flick it on, and the beam cuts through the gloom. My breath catches as I see what‚Äôs inside.

I kneel beneath the staircase, heart pounding. Tiny, almost invisible mechanisms are embedded just beneath each step‚Äîan intricate web of thin wires snaking across the wood. They‚Äôre connected to a small, rusted bell mounted on the wall, its surface mottled with age. My fingers tremble as I trace the delicate wires, realizing someone went to great lengths to set this trap. The faint metallic ping of the bell echoes softly in the silence, like a warning whisper.¬†¬†

It‚Äôs no accident that these stairs don‚Äôt creak‚Äîevery wire, every trigger, is carefully wired, a sinister alarm system designed to alert someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwhen I move. A cold shiver runs down my spine. Why? To wake the house when I sleep downstairs? To keep watch over me? My mind spirals with questions, each more unsettling than the last.

I rise slowly, my mind racing with everything I‚Äôve just uncovered. I head upstairs, intending to tell Mom, but her muffled voice drifts down‚Äîshe‚Äôs on the phone again, talking with her friend. I hesitate, listening for a moment, then decide to wait until she‚Äôs finished.¬†¬†

Reluctantly, I go back downstairs, the house eerily quiet. I grab the old diary from the corner, settle onto the couch, and try to steady my nerves.",3,1749090962.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Hey.

It's not easy to start this without feeling my throat close up. Without hearing the sound of his breathing behind me ‚Äî even though I know there's no one here. Today, I write to warn. Because what happened to me and Manel... it's not just about fear. It's about meat. It's about what can be ripped away from you when you ignore the signs.

Manel started to understand. I came home from work looking back. Sometimes I thought it was paranoia. Until it wasn't anymore.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. Irregular, almost childish handwriting. No subscription. Just one sentence that burned:

> ""You're even more beautiful in person than in the photo. I like to see you come back.""



We returned to my family's house. We thought it was the end. But that... that was just the beginning of the dismemberment of our peace.

The second letter came after the first photo.

Manel vomited when she saw it. It was sweaty, blurry, but it was her ‚Äî in front of our building, holding the grocery bag. A moment she didn't even remember. But he remembered. He archived.

He smiled. It didn't run. He just turned and walked slowly. As if he were guiding me.

> Rule 5: Never follow. Never follow something that wants to be followed. You will get where he wants you.



But I followed.

I ran to him. I reached it. I pushed against the asphalt. The sound of the impact was dry, and the smell... his smell was rotten, like a dead pig on the side of the road.

The police took it. They found the photos. Several. Some from Manel. Others‚Ä¶ from women we don't recognize. One, in particular, had her eyes crossed out and her mouth cut out with a red pen.

But then‚Ä¶ silence.

No judgement. No sentence. No name.

> Rule 6: If the police say they ‚Äúwill take care of it‚Äù, ask the detainee‚Äôs name. If they refuse, start digging. You may need a hiding place before the week is over.

> ""I loved the new haircut. It would go with formaldehyde.""



> Rule 7: If a message appears inside the house, even with locked doors: change it. Don't even think. Don't even hesitate. Leave as you are, even if it's naked and bleeding.



Manel hasn't spoken since. She sits in the corner, looking at the wall. He scratches the same word with his nails, again and again: ‚Äúreturn‚Äù.

I? I don't sleep. I just write, watch, and prepare.

Because the man who took our peace of mind...

> Rule 8: If he takes your peace, he doesn't just want that. He wants the sound of your bones breaking in the dark. And he will wait for the right moment to hear it.



And if you, reader, got this far ‚Äî memorize these rules. Spread it out. Because he might be reading this over your shoulder right now.

And if he is...

> Last rule: Never look back slowly. If you have to look, let it be to hit the stake in the neck.

2. They always ghost. I previously always booked lunch or dinner for 1st meet to get to know each other but lots of times, ladies just ""disappears"" few hours before the meet. That's why I think coffee chat is a good idea just because it's lightweight and won't waste you too much time.

3. They refuse face time and request a few hundred dollars even for 1st meet without intimacy which I don't understand...

1l3o0qc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3o0qc,Neat Cakes Dominion Road,"Over the last couple of weeks I‚Äôve been venturing around Mount Eden on foot trying out different cafes.

My periambulations (and Instagram) took me to Neat Cakes just down from the op shops at the city end of Dominion Road.

Neat Cakes does plant based baked goods (specialising in cake) and I, a dairy fiend, was intrigued to see how well a vegan icing hit the icing spot.

Over my travels I have returned to Neat Cakes multiple times and have now tried a fairly decent chunk of their offerings and feel qualified now to say I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend them to people looking for cakes and other baked goods - even if not vegan. I have also found that they last a good number of days in both the fridge and the pantry which came in handy with some of the richer flavours. 

Here‚Äôs some of the food I‚Äôve tried:

The Bruce Tub:
This is supposed to be a version of the bruce cake in the Matilda movie. This is layers of chocolate cake and Whittakers chocolate ganache. This was tasty but (unsurprisingly) very rich. It took me a couple of days to finish because after the first couple of bites I found it did get quite one note. It needed a bit of cream or something else to cut through all the chocolate to make it more sophisticated (for me, at least). Dug out with some whipped cream or ice cream would both give you diabetes and likely hit the spot. I also found the tub format quite difficult o eat from in this case - the top of the cake stuck to the lid and you really had to dig out the cake. It is definitely cake for if you are going through a Bridget Jones style break up and want to eat your feelings with a chocolate cake rather than a pint of ice cream. If i wanted a more sophisticated cake that wasn‚Äôt entirely chocolate overload (though there‚Äôs a time and a place for that ofc) I‚Äôd definitely go for the chocolate/salted caramel offering from Mint Cakery. 

Black Forest Tub (no photo):
This was layers of chocolate cake sandwiched between cherries and cream. Again the same issue with the Bruce tub where the top stuck to the lid (if you care about ‚≠êÔ∏èaesthetics‚≠êÔ∏è. However this did what I needed the Bruce to do - the creamy layer cut through the richness of the cake and the cherries added great sour/tartness. I really enjoyed this one and would get it again instantly.

Tiramisu Cake Tub (no photo):
Italian nonnas of generations past are probably rolling somewhere because While yummy, unfortunately not a Tiramisu in my mind. This might be one where you need the authentic dairy experience. The coffee and booze notes needed to be stronger and the creamy layer didn‚Äôt have quite the same decadent quality of a mascarpone tiramisu. Still yummy though but if you want a proper tiramisu you might be disappointed. 

Peanut Butter and Chocolate Mini Cake:
My favourite. Would eat again and again. A moist chocolate cake with a creamy top that you can‚Äôt tell isn‚Äôt dairy cut with a peanut butter sauce and crunchy peanut bits. Delightful. No notes. Covered in gold glitter too which appeals to the ‚ú®fancy üåü in me.

Ginger Kisses:
Good old fashioned home baking. I love a ginger kiss. These are massive and nicely subtly flavoured. You can tell the cream filling isn‚Äôt dairy based as it tastes a little ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô but I didn‚Äôt find this to be a negative. Good second day too.

Lemon and Passionfruit and Lemon and Raspberry Mini Cakes:
I‚Äôm a bit of a lemon cake snob as too often I have had a lemon cake that isn‚Äôt remotely lemony. These are nicely lemon flavoured (though I wouldn‚Äôt overwhelmingly so) and very moist. The icing on top I found to be slightly bland and needed the fruit syrup to liven it up - which it did delightfully. The meringue kiss on top was also delightful. 

Chocolate and Raspberry Mini Cake:
At the risk of sounding repetitive here, the same as above applies to this cake. The chocolate cake itself is moist and nicely flavoured. The icing on top is not overly sweet and so is nicely enhanced by the raspberry coulis which makes it just the right amount of sweetness. Again you can tell the frosting is plant based in the mini cake. Interestingly it wasn‚Äôt so noticeable in the chocolate peanut butter one - maybe a slightly different recipe with some PB incorporated into it? That isn‚Äôt to say its off putting, just a different experience from the standard dairy based frosting (of course). 

The coffee: 
Solid. Never fear: you can get dairy based milk as well as the special stuff. To be honest I‚Äôm not really going here for the coffee and am not really a coffee expert but I‚Äôve been happy each time.

I mentioned to her that my nevermo friends watched it and were asking me questions like, ""How come Mormons can't drink coffee or tea, but can have tons of soda and, you know, ketamine."" Her first response was, ""What's ketamine?"" I guess I should have seen that coming. 

After I explained it, though, she admitted it sounded bad and even though she thought they were wrong, she understood why they wouldn't feel like it broke WoW because it's not explicitly against the rules-- not to mention that it was administered by a doctor, so they might have thought it was like a prescription? 

I guess I was overcome with the spirit of contention, because I just started spurting problematic facts about the WoW-- we don't follow it the way it was intended, Joseph meant \*literal\* ""hot drinks,"" the whole thing was massively changed around the prohibition, there's a ton of studies showing the benefits of both coffee and tea, etc. Even though I info-dumped exmo facts, I kept my tone respectful. I didn't actually mean to go off, the words just hit my mouth before they passed through my brain, and when she seemed down I kept going. Keep in mind, she seemed to fully accept all of this, and was even nodding through a lot of it. She even emphatically agreed when I said it was so much unhealthier for people to drink energy drinks and tons of soda instead of coffee and tea. And she was even on board when I said I wished they'd change the WoW to be more about common sense health decisions instead of outdated rules. I finished it all with something like, ""With all the changes they're making, maybe they'll make coffee and tea okay, soon.""

And after all of that, she was like, ""Well, even if they do, I'll never drink them."" And she said it in the most TBM tone you can imagine-- you know the one. It's so frustrating, because she can see the problems, she can see how the rules as they are now let people convince themselves ketamine is not against the rules (even though she feels it is), she sees that the WoW isn't actually healthy, and yet I am sure she will follow it to her grave and seeing the issues with it won't so much as leave a smudge on her testimony. I know many TBMs are like this, but it's absolutely infuriating. I just needed to rant about it. The TBM thought shield is real.",46,1749090217.0,exmormon,12,1.0,False

(UEIC): Remote, But Not Forgotten","I‚Äôm going to continue posting writeups on investments I genuinely believe are undervalued. I‚Äôll try to stay consistent with these, but just a heads-up it takes a good amount of time and research to dig deep into each name, and I‚Äôm doing this solo. That said, I enjoy the process, and if you get some solid returns out of it too, even better. Cheers.

One quick note: I won‚Äôt be disclosing how many shares I own in any of these companies just my average cost basis. I‚Äôll also mention if I plan to add to a position. I‚Äôm not here to manage your money, but I do want to share some alpha and lay out my thinking, instead of letting the research just sit on my hard drives or float around in my head.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm not one to chase the next hot SaaS name or some flashy ‚ÄúAI disruptor‚Äù that‚Äôs trading at 30x sales. What grabs my attention are unloved, under covered micro and small-cap stocks, the kind of companies nobody‚Äôs talking about on CNBC. That‚Äôs where inefficiencies live. UEIC fits that mold perfectly. It's a name I stumbled into, did the work on, and ultimately took a position in currently owning at an average cost of $9.209. I'm not here to sell you dreams just laying out why I think the market‚Äôs sleeping on this one. 

Now let‚Äôs be honest: UEIC isn‚Äôt sexy. They make remotes, smart thermostats, IR blasters, and some backend software that helps devices communicate. It‚Äôs not the type of product you Instagram. But boring doesn‚Äôt mean broken. In fact, boring businesses often print the best returns, especially when they‚Äôve been beaten down like this one. 

Headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, Universal Electronics Inc. has been around since 1986. They specialize in wireless control tech for smart homes and entertainment systems. Their hardware and cloud-based software power many devices you likely use without thinking the remotes from your cable provider, HVAC interfaces from Daikin, and other household controls. They‚Äôre embedded in the ecosystem. The market, however, priced them as if they‚Äôre on the brink of irrelevance like a remote lost in your couch cushions. 

What makes things more interesting is Immersion Corporation (IMMR), which now owns nearly 12% of UEIC and has Eric Singer IMMR‚Äôs CEO sitting as UEIC‚Äôs Chairman. That‚Äôs not a coincidence. While there hasn‚Äôt been a formal activist campaign launched (yet), it sure smells like something is brewing. When someone builds a stake that large and starts planting board members, they usually aren‚Äôt just there for free coffee. 

Financially, UEIC‚Äôs Q1 2025 results were fine, not earth-shattering, but stable. They did $92.3 million in revenue, a slight increase year-over-year, with growth in the connected home segment offsetting declines in traditional entertainment. The headline here isn‚Äôt the growth rate, it‚Äôs the fact that they‚Äôre generating $90M+ in quarterly revenue, still positive on gross margins, and trading at a market cap of just $87 million. That disconnect is where the opportunity lies. 

The company has taken a scalpel to its operations. It‚Äôs closed unprofitable factories, moved production to Vietnam, cut SG&A, and is targeting 30% gross margins in the near term. It‚Äôs no longer the bloated version of its former self. With just \~$27 million in cash, manageable debt, and no financial red flags, the balance sheet is clean. They‚Äôve also bought back shares in recent quarters, signaling management knows this thing is dirt cheap.

 One overlooked point: they‚Äôre not just a random parts supplier. UEIC has tier-one clients like Comcast and Daikin, plus proprietary tech like QuickSet that‚Äôs embedded across a wide swath of connected devices. That gives them an economic moat, albeit a quiet one. 

The bear case largely revolves around soft demand post-COVID and the secular decline in traditional TV. Fair enough. But what happens if demand stabilizes or even modestly rebounds in connected devices? With all the fat trimmed, a small revenue bump could translate into outsized earnings growth. 

Valuation-wise, this thing is a textbook value play. Based on a 5-year average EV/EBITDA multiple of 16.99 and a normalized EBITDA of $23.9 million, you get an implied enterprise value of \~$406 million. Back out the net debt and divide by the share count (\~13.1 million), and you land on a price target of $32.55 a clean 370% upside from current levels. That‚Äôs not based on fantasy either, it‚Äôs anchored in historic operating norms, with plenty of room for upside if activist pressure builds or growth reaccelerates. 

Bottom line: UEIC is one of those names that looks boring on the surface, but the numbers and the setup tell a different story. In a market obsessed with narratives, sometimes it pays to focus on value hiding in plain sight.",1,1749090123.0,u_0Baby0Driver0,0,1.0,False
