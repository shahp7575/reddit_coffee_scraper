1oobdpd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oobdpd,Regional Pricing in Brazil,"Hello, Coffee Stain team.

I’m a Brazilian player and a big fan of your work, and I’ve been really excited to play Satisfactory on PlayStation. However, I noticed a huge difference between the regional pricing on Steam and the pricing on the PlayStation Store.

On Steam, the game follows proper regional pricing, making it much more accessible for players in Brazil. But on PlayStation, the price is simply not affordable when compared to our minimum wage and the cost of games on other platforms.

For example, the recently launched game ARC Raiders initially had its Brazilian price set at R$ 214,90 on PlayStation, then was later reduced to R$ 144,80 in recognition of regional-pricing concerns. 

The current PS Store price is around R$229,90, while on Steam the regular price is R$107,99, and the lowest historical price was even R$35,99 — a massive difference for us.

I really want to play Satisfactory on PS5, but with this price gap it becomes financially impossible for many Brazilian players.

Please consider implementing regional pricing for the PlayStation Store, just like you already do on Steam. It would make the game accessible to thousands of players here who love and support your work.
Thank you for your attention, and I hope this can be reviewed.

So i was reading this breakdown of Kalshi on CoffeeSpace (on their founder journey series) and it hit me how delusional you actually have to be if your idea is truly a winner. Because instead of chasing quick growth they spent years building infrastructure and fighting regulators for a license they might never get, and only then went to see if anyone even cared.

So, should i stop looking for projects that i think people would want and start something that i actually care about? Should i build, get punched by reality, keep going, and hope to win evantually?

I’m getting so worked up i think i even might start lurking on coffeespace now to find a cofounder. What if the next kalshi is being cooked up in one of those chats right now?

In the past decade, the coffee industry has transformed into a highly competitive and brand-driven market. From local roasters to global coffee chains, everyone is striving to create a unique identity that resonates with their audience. One of the most effective ways to achieve this distinction lies in the packaging—specifically, *custom coffee bags*. As coffee culture expands worldwide, consumers are no longer just looking for a caffeine fix; they are seeking an experience. Custom coffee bags play a critical role in delivering this experience, combining functionality, freshness, and design to attract attention on crowded shelves. These personalized bags not only protect the flavor and aroma of coffee beans but also tell a story about the brand’s values, style, and quality. The growing trend of customization allows brands to connect emotionally with customers, making packaging a powerful marketing tool that goes beyond mere storage.

**Importance of Functionality and Freshness in Coffee Packaging**  
While visual appeal is vital, the core purpose of any coffee bag remains to preserve freshness and flavor. Coffee is a delicate product—exposure to oxygen, moisture, or light can rapidly degrade its quality. [Custom coffee bags](https://es.bowepack.com/collections/custom-coffee-packaging) are designed with this challenge in mind. Manufacturers now offer multi-layer materials, such as kraft paper combined with aluminum foil or biodegradable film, to create an airtight barrier. Additionally, one-way degassing valves have become standard in premium packaging, allowing carbon dioxide to escape without letting oxygen in. This technology ensures that roasted beans maintain their aroma and taste for longer periods. Resealable zippers, tear notches, and gusseted bases also add convenience and functionality for end users. Beyond practicality, the choice of materials and features communicates a brand’s dedication to quality. For example, eco-conscious brands may opt for compostable or recyclable coffee bags, appealing to environmentally aware consumers while maintaining freshness and integrity.

**The Role of Design and Branding in Custom Coffee Bags**  
The visual design of a custom coffee bag can significantly influence purchasing decisions. In fact, studies show that consumers often judge a product’s quality based on its packaging before even tasting it. Custom coffee bags provide a canvas for storytelling—through colors, typography, textures, and imagery, a brand can express its identity and philosophy. Minimalist designs with matte finishes may suggest sophistication and craftsmanship, while vibrant colors and bold illustrations can appeal to younger, trend-driven audiences. Modern printing technologies, such as digital and rotogravure printing, make it possible to reproduce high-resolution graphics and custom finishes that enhance brand recognition. Additionally, brands often use packaging to communicate transparency—listing sourcing information, roast levels, tasting notes, and certifications like “Fair Trade” or “Organic.” These design elements help consumers connect with the story behind the product, making them more likely to form long-term brand loyalty.

**Sustainability and Innovation in Coffee Packaging**  
Sustainability has become a defining factor in the modern coffee industry, influencing both production and packaging. As consumers grow more environmentally conscious, brands are under increasing pressure to adopt eco-friendly practices. Custom coffee bags are evolving to meet this demand through innovative materials and production methods. Recyclable pouches made from polyethylene (PE), compostable bags made from plant-based PLA films, and biodegradable kraft paper options are gaining popularity. Some companies are experimenting with water-based inks and minimal packaging designs to reduce environmental impact further. Moreover, lightweight flexible packaging lowers shipping costs and carbon footprints compared to rigid containers. Sustainable packaging doesn’t just appeal to the conscience—it enhances brand reputation, showing commitment to ethical and responsible practices. For coffee roasters and retailers, adopting green packaging is no longer just an option; it is a strategic advantage in a marketplace where consumers actively seek brands that align with their environmental values.

**The Future of Custom Coffee Bags in a Competitive Market**  
The future of custom coffee bags lies at the intersection of innovation, personalization, and sustainability. As technology advances, we can expect more smart packaging solutions—such as QR codes or NFC tags—that provide detailed product information, brewing tips, or even traceability data from farm to cup. Customization will continue to evolve beyond visuals, incorporating tactile and interactive elements that engage multiple senses. Small and medium coffee roasters will benefit from digital printing technologies, which allow affordable short-run customization and quick design updates without compromising quality. Furthermore, the focus on sustainability will drive continuous improvements in materials, ensuring eco-friendly options that perform just as well as traditional ones. Ultimately, custom coffee bags will remain an essential part of the coffee industry’s identity—merging aesthetics with performance to create packaging that not only preserves quality but also builds trust and brand loyalty. In a world where coffee is both a product and a passion, the bag it comes in is more than just packaging—it is part of the story that connects roasters to consumers, one cup at a time.",1,1762272767.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

It is not my first round as my longest streak was 120 days last year. I just decided to jump back in again as if I hadn’t left. The first two days were the worst and by day three I was locked in. 

Last year after being a month in I was not hungry until around the time of my eating window. It was easy to ignore the little hunger I did feel from time to time, not to mention my job then was more demanding than what I am doing now. I fear it has something to do with what I am consuming in the morning.

I drink Mio energy in the morning to get my day going. It used to be coffee until it started to upset my stomach. I found the Mio to be much easier on my stomach and I would follow it up with some water to stay hydrated alongside the caffeine. From my understanding Mio Energy has 0 Calories and 0 sugar, though now I’m worried that the artificial sweetener is causing my body to react in some way that breaks my fast. I know little of nutrition, could it be possible I am ruining my fast with my Mio Energy consumption? Thank you for your time.

1oob8tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oob8tb/shadow_under_the_city/,Shadow Under the City,"They had met at a metal show in Kansas City, down in the West Bottoms, which was a part of town that always smelled like piss. Together, they bonded over their love of decay, and their affection for hateful guitars and screaming vocalists, and these two passions bound them, and drove their every decision. 

Saturday was one of the days they had off together. Kurt woke a bit before noon, relieved to not start the day in a blind rage as he did most mornings, when he would groan and curse at his alarm as it ripped him from his slumber, forcing him to get up and pull on his always-muddy boots and stagger to his rickety black Honda to go to his job at the warehouse, so he could stuff boxes into the backs of semi trucks. He had no passion for his nine to five, and despised mornings, but it was better than starving.

Instead, today, his eyes fluttered open on their own, and he sat up, rubbed them, and oriented himself as he gazed around his bedroom. He regarded his belongings. The box of vinyl records next to his dresser, the stack of cassettes on top of it, one of the dog skulls he had found in New Orleans on top of that. Next to his door hung his army old jackets, which he had picked up at a military surplus store, since he had never served a day in his life, despite his affinity for the attire. He had sewn the patches and artwork into the digital camo and olive drab jackets himself, as any true punk or metalhead should. 

I’m no poser, he assured himself.

His walls were adorned with band posters and photos he had taken on his adventures into forbidden ruins, and on the wall above his nightstand were several drawings done by Jane, mostly of them and the time they had spent together over the past eight months. Next to him, on the nightstand itself, laid his KA-BAR, the combat knife he favored so much, sitting in its sheath. 

Underneath his nightstand, in a lockbox, was his Colt 1911. Like the KA-BAR, Kurt had never truly used it, but he took it to the range often, and having it and knowing how to use it made him feel much safer in his home, since he knew firsthand that locks could only keep out so much. 

On his other side, laying in the bed next to him, still comatose, was Jane. He watched her for a moment as she slept, gazing at her slender form. The covers had been pulled halfway off of her as he had sat up, leaving her exposed. She slept in a tank top, and he looked at the tattoo of a feathered serpent wrapped around her bicep. He smiled as he thought about the terrible tattoo of a small flower on her hip that she had gotten one drunken night from an old friend who owned a tattoo gun. Her hair was a mess, and she had drooled on her pillow. 

God, she's pretty, he thought, as he leaned down and kissed her cheek, causing her to groan unconsciously.

He stroked her loose red curls, and then pulled the blankets back over her as he got up. 

Kurt pulled on a pair of pajama pants and a Midnight t-shirt off the foot of the bed, and went into the kitchen. Austin and Elijah were at work, but Liam sat on the couch in the living room, watching something about the occult on Youtube, which streamed through the TV, as he sparked the communal coffee table bong. It gurgled as he inhaled, and he coughed as he exhaled. Liam had grown up in Grandview, in an evangelical cult, and, while he was certainly no longer Christian, he still believed in the power of prayer and the existence of the divine, practicing some form of paganism that Kurt was unsure of the name of. Liam finished coughing, spat into a small trash can sitting at his feet, and sat the bong down as he pushed his long black hair out of his clean-shaven face and tucked it behind his ear. His bloodshot eyes focused on Kurt, and they grunted an acknowledgement to each other. 

Kurt assumed that was all Liam had planned for his own day off, but Kurt had big plans this afternoon. Recently, Jane had been contacted by another explorer via Instagram, who called himself RatKing. This was a common way for urban explorers to network with one another, so it wasn't unusual, even though neither her nor Kurt knew him, but they had a lot of mutual followers, many of which were other explorers that Jane knew and trusted. This RatKing fellow was claiming to have found a way into a monstrously huge underground cold storage facility, that was supposed to have been sealed years ago when parts of it had caved in after a fire in the 90s. The property was supposed to span almost a thousand acres, almost entirely underground. 

Jane would’ve assumed this was a bullshit claim from some strange man on the internet trying to bang the goth girl, except he had supplied photos as evidence. What Ratking shared was breathtaking; heavy machinery left to rust, some kind of railroad system to move goods through the facility, and vaults containing historic film reels, all of which were things that both Jane and Kurt decided they had to see. So, when Ratking said he wanted to meetup, giving a time and a set of GPS coordinates, Jane agreed.

Kurt ate his late breakfast, and then went back to his bedroom to rouse Jane. Then, they got dressed, laced up their boots, and Kurt watched her pull her messy hair back into a ponytail and apply eyeliner in the mirror on the back of his door. She smiled at his reflection as he pulled his OD green jacket on, until his dark eyes fixed on her. His shaggy brown hair was barely brushed, and the neckline beneath his short beard was unkept. 

“You look like a homeless Vietnam veteran in those jackets,” she told him, a smirk across her lips. 

Kurt furrowed his brow, “Thanks, I think?” 

They met RatKing at a gas station. The sign on the front read Please Stop! as if it were begging for mercy. It was next to a busy roadway, with an expanse of woodland behind it. Kurt’s car was one of the only two in the parking lot, and the caged counter was staffed by a polite Indian man who thanked Jane for buying an energy drink. 

They were slightly early, and they looked around for their contact when they walked back outside. Jane leaned against the Honda, its peeling black paint still hot in the October sun. She lit a cigarette, puffing it, and sipping her energy drink, until, after a few minutes, a scrawny white man with a buzzcut wandered around the side of the building. He was wearing a wifebeater with an unzipped hoodie over it, slightly ripped jeans, and black rubber boots, all of which were covered in a layer of mud and dirt. His cold blue eyes found Jane’s, and he smiled, revealing a gray front tooth. He outstretched his filthy hand to shake hers as he approached. 

“Are you Dusk?” he asked, referring to her online handle, DuskDreams.  

“Yeah, RatKing?” Jane asked back, accepting his hand. 

RatKing looked at Kurt, who looked at the tattoo of the razor blade above RatKing’s brow. The online stranger asked Jane, “And who's this?”

“This is my boyfriend, Charon,” Jane explained, releasing RatKing’s hand to gesture to Kurt. RatKing’s eyes widened in surprise. 

“Oh, pleasure to meet you!” he said, patting Kurt’s shoulder. Kurt smiled politely, noticing that the knuckles of the hand on his shoulder had the numbers 1-3-1-2 across them. 

“I only expected one of you. It's cool though, just, ya know, don't tell anyone about this entrance I found. Don't want any taggers or YouTubers blowing the spot,” RatKing continued. 

“Of course,” Kurt assured him, “We know how it is. Loose lips sink ships.”

RatKing revealed his gray tooth again. 

“Cool, now come on, lemme show you guys what I've found.”

He turned and led them into the woods, which had taken on their autumn tones for the year. A brown mat of dead leaves crunched beneath the boots of the three explorers, and Jane’s hair blended right into the foliage that still clung to the trees and overgrowth. Kurt glanced over at her, scowling and jerking his head towards RatKing, whose back was to them. 

The meaning of Kurt’s look was clear; I got a bad feeling about this guy. 

Jane shrugged. It was just one guy, and Kurt had his knife, so she felt secure enough. 

Kurt decided to ask RatKing about his background to get a better feel for him, deciding that maybe he was just being judgemental. 

“So, RatKing, what do you do for work?”

RatKing kept his eyes on the ground ahead of him, but spoke over his shoulder, saying, “I don't work at all right now, actually. I live as a train hopper, but I'll pick up a job here and there to get by when I need to.”

“Don’t think I have the grit to get by like that.”

“It’s not always easy, but the places it takes you, the people you meet, and the mornings you wake up and still have half a cigarette to smoke make it worth it.”

“Don’t get me wrong- it sounds badass, just, yeah, difficult. How’d you end up in KC?” 

“Just crashing with my ex for a few weeks. Heard about this place through some explorers while I’m in town. Found a sinkhole that led down into it, and figured I could share it with some like-minded people, maybe make some friends, maybe hit some other spots with them.”

“Shit, maybe. What else have you hit?”

RatKing told them of his time on the rails, and how he’d have to stuff himself into various compartments on cargo trains and hope the bulls wouldn’t bother to look for him, and, if he got into the railyard unobserved, they never did. Railroad police are always prowling in their white pickup trucks, and always eager to beat someone senseless. He told them about his time with punks in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, where he just happened to end up that time, and how much coke they did that night when they broke into a recently closed down bank. Said he and some of them then rode the rails to Chicago, and ended up in Gary, Indiana, where they holed up and squatted together in an abandoned building in the industrial wastes, far away from any place that was truly civilized, and that they weren’t either. None of them owned a cellphone, but some of them carried instruments, and knew how to play acoustic, and they’d get fucked up on whatever they could get their hands on, and party all night, every night, but that was a long time ago now.

Kurt and Jane were both fascinated by the stranger’s tales. He had lived hard, and seen and done many things, much of which was more daring than anything that either of them would bother messing with. 

“So you’re a train hopping folk punk, then? Are you into Ramshackle Glory?” Jane inquired.

RatKing flashed his dead tooth again, answering, “I fuck with Pat the Bunny super hard. What about you guys?”

“Oh, I knew it!” Jane laughed, “No, One Last Big Job is an occasional guilty pleasure of mine, but I don’t consider myself a fan, per-se. Charon and I are metalheads, for the most part, but I think we can both get behind some punk.”

Kurt nodded in agreement, gesturing to his band tee and battle jacket.

“Hell of a life you’ve lived. You, uh, sober these days?” he asked RatKing tentatively.

“I wouldn’t say that, exactly. It’s more like I found a new vice,” RatKing told him, as he shoved through the underbrush, and pointed toward the sinkhole that had sucked down a patch of woodland ahead of them. 

They had reached the muddy maw of the monster buried below. Kurt guessed that the sinkhole was about fifty feet wide, and twenty feet deep. When the ground gave way, it took several trees with it, some of their rotten logs still stuck out of the mud and rock, broken and barely covered, like bodies in a shallow grave, left in the woods to decay. On the far side of the pit, one tree still desperately clung to the surface, leaning over the grave of its friends at an angle, its roots partially exposed, like twisted fingers grasping at the earth beneath its trunk, holding on for dear life. 
At the deepest part of the sinkhole was the entrance to the cold storage mine itself. A black hole at the bottom, big enough to fit through. All the explorers had to do was slide down the incline and step over the broken shale and dead foliage. 

RatKing led the way, and, once he was through, Charon slid into the stygian darkness, and Dusk descended after him. 

Kurt knew a bit about this place, as other local explorers had been searching for an entrance on and off over the years, and Jane had filled in some of the details she had gleaned from RatKing for him. The place they had entered into was something like Atlantis or El Dorado as far as urban explorers in KC were concerned. A treasure trove full of untold mystery, lost to the world, begging to be found. Kurt began referring to this particular ruin as Tartarus, however, since there were no roads paved in gold or sunken cities struck down at their height. Instead, Tartarus was an oppressively dark pit, which was covered in grime, and filled his lungs with the scent of earth and decay. 

It began its life as a limestone mine, and, like every limestone mine Kurt knew of, was a room and pillar mine, meaning that it was essentially one giant cavern that was held up by regular pillars of rock that hadn’t been carved away and mixed into cement, like everything else in the space. The layout was much different, and much more open than the winding tunnels and deadfalls of gold mines one typically pictures out west. The ceilings were about ten to fifteen feet tall, so that heavy machinery could come and go unimpeded. Tartarus was no exception in this aspect, but the sheer scale of how far it reached was startling to contemplate. So much still, uninterrupted black.

On top of this, Tartarus became a cold storage facility in the 50s, after the mining ceased, which wasn’t unusual either, since underground hovers around a constant sixty degrees no matter the weather above ground, with no need to heat and cool the space, as it did so naturally. Another thing that made Tartarus so exceptional was that when it caught fire in the 90s, it was left to smolder for six months, as the fire department didn’t want to risk navigating the abyss, particularly while it was full of smoke and flames. Tartarus was- almost literally- a hellscape like its namesake, and the openings to the mine were sealed to suffocate the inferno once it was clear that no one was trapped within, and the contents of its warehouses and vaults were considered a total loss. As far as anyone knew, that’s how it had been up until recently, when RatKing found the sinkhole in the woods left by a section of ceiling caving in on itself due to neglect, and, potentially, heat damage.
Kurt clicked on his flashlight, scanning his surroundings. He was knee deep in mud already, but his boots were waterproof, and laced tightly enough to not be pulled off by the gluttonous slurping of the hungry muck. It felt like it was trying to suck him under, and probably could, if it were deeper. The image of a pair of huge, brown lips wrapped around his ankles, greedily licking at his leather boots played through his head as he pushed forward. 

The area they found themselves in was partially filled in, with various passages snaking off to the sides. It appeared that some of the undeveloped sections of mine had been intentionally filled with a very fine, gray powder, that Kurt recognized as fly ash, which is a byproduct of coal power plants, and is often pumped into old mines to keep them from caving in. 

A lot of good that did, Kurt thought, as he squelched through the sludge, following RatKing forward. 

He looked over at Jane next to him, partially illuminated by the flashlights. Her clothes were already filthy, and her hair and face were streaked with dirt from their entrance. She turned and looked at him, and smiled, eyes lit with excitement. Kurt was still somewhat apprehensive about their guide, but he, too, was thrilled about this find. 

The passage they were in was easily large enough for two semi trucks to pass by one another unimpeded. The floor was thick with mud, and the walls and ceiling were sheer faces of pale gray limestone. RatKing led them deeper, until they reached the back end of the developed area itself, marked by the remains of a chain link fence, now no longer attached to its posts. Past this, the floor was smooth cement, and there were cinder block walls and offices, the paperwork still sitting on the desks, the chairs sprouting mold, and the filing cabinets rusted shut.
Kurt picked up one of the papers on the desk, finding that it was no longer crisp and rigid, but instead soft and floppy, almost as if it had been fished out of a swimming pool half an hour ago. He tried to read it, but whatever had once been printed on to the papers was now entirely illegible. He set the paper back down on the desk, and realized that some of the material had disintegrated on to his fingertips. He wiped away the white flakes on his muddy pant leg. 

“Charon, look!” Jane called behind him. 

He whipped around, to see her pointing her light at the peeling wallpaper on the drywall in the hallway of the office space they were in. He approached and inspected the wall. He was pretty sure it was supposed to be eggshell white at one point, but now, it was mostly a light brown, with large black patches, particularly near the floor. There's a lot of mold here, Kurt thought, noticing the particles floating in the beam of his flashlight, realizing that almost all of them must have been mold spores. The mine was turning into a dank, dark cave since it had gone three decades without upkeep. 

“Ah, so that's why my lungs feel so heavy. Guess I'll worry about this in another ten or twenty years,” Kurt joked. 

Jane giggled. RatKing encouraged them to continue the tour. They pressed onward, deeper into the dark. They exited the office area, and found themselves on what was likely once an empty loading dock, crossed it, and then jumped a few feet down onto a roadway that was roughly the size of the one they came in on. To the left, the path was totally blocked off by a cave in. However, in front of them, was the largest dome-out that Kurt had ever seen. It had to be at least a hundred feet of jagged rock ahead of them, and piled over ten feet high. Despite the startling amount of material that had fallen from the ceiling, there was no daylight visible coming from above, but Kurt knew, one day soon, where he was standing now would be the bottom of a sinkhole. 

“Don't just stare. Come on, let's go,” RatKing instructed. 

“Alright, if you're sure,” Jane said, taking a deep breath, and grabbing a handhold on a boulder to pull herself up. 

Kurt did the same. He was nimble as he crossed over the top of the rock pile, hopping from one large boulder to the next, like they were stepping stones that shifted slightly beneath his weight. Jane was far more slow and methodical, careful not to get her ankle caught between the rocks, or trip and have one of their jagged edges meet her skull. Kurt thought about a horse breaking its leg in a gopher hole and then being put down by its rider. He hoped that wouldn't be a relevant comparison. 

RatKing had a similar approach to this large obstacle as Jane, tripping once as he picked his way across, and cursing as he went. 
They reached the other side, which led directly into another loading dock, which was empty with the exception of a random wheelchair, just a few feet from the base of the dome-out. Kurt considered sitting in it, but it was so rusted, he was fairly certain it would collapse underneath his body weight, to say nothing of how filthy it was.

RatKing led them through this warehouse space through another tunnel, saying that the loading bay to the left was entirely flooded. Kurt and Jane followed him up the passageway. It appeared to lead into a parking area of some kind, which Kurt assumed was for the workers of these various warehouses. 

“Oh my god!” Jane said, pulling Kurt’s sleeve and pointing, “Look at that!” 

She practically skipped her way through a doorway to their left. Kurt followed her, and she stopped in front of a row of lockers, pulling one of their doors open a bit more, and shining her light inside, revealing playboy pinups of topless women taped to the inside.

“No fucking way!” Kurt cackled, “All of these lockers are covered in rust, and the titties are somehow unscathed?”

He knelt down examining the contents of the rest of the locker. There was a Royals baseball cap hanging on a hook, the remains of a ziplock bag that contained something that was roughly sandwich-shaped, but it was now a very dark green, and Kurt dared not open it. He shined his light on the room behind him, revealing more lockers and a few benches. He approached a broken mirror on the far wall, his fractured visage looking back at him through the spiderweb of cracks and condensation. He was drenched in sweat from the hike down here, and covered in mud and grime, just as RatKing had been when they had met him by the gas station. Then, the smell hit him.

“Dear fuck, what is that?” Kurt gagged, light darting back and forth, looking for the offending source. 

His light found a brown puddle on the floor, and he walked around a brick divider to discover its source; a bathroom stall, its door hanging on one hinge. It wouldn’t have been the first time his boots had touched human feces, but he didn’t want them to. He could guess what was seeping out from under that door. Looking down at the edge of the puddle, however, he noticed several boot prints that he had not noticed a moment ago, belonging to several different shoes, coming and going from the bathroom stall, tracking sewage out of the locker room, before getting lost in the gray limestone dust that covered the floor of the entire facility. Kurt turned to RatKing, who leaned in the threshold of the doorway, watching them. He met Kurt’s gaze.

“You shown anyone else this place?” Kurt asked, suddenly remembering his suspicion.

“No,” RatKing shook his head, “Just you guys, so far. Though… maybe someone else found a way down here?”

Kurt looked at RatKing for a moment. His face was still, and his gray tooth hidden behind his lips. It’s possible, Kurt thought, besides, if he wanted to rob or rape us, he could’ve tried to by now. Kurt shrugged.
“Makes sense. Let’s keep an eye out for any other signs of activity,” he agreed, diffusing the tension.
Jane took a photo of the porno pinups, and the two of them followed RatKing out of the room, continuing their tour through the moldering abyss. Before long, they found themselves on a platform next to a railway junction, likely used to move freight and heavy equipment around at some point. The rocky ceiling was stained black from smoke, making the area seem even darker than it already was. There was a cave-in blocking one side of the tracks, and the other end went off into the darkness, and around a bend. The tracks themselves had a forklift on them, with the tracks themselves sitting under several inches of clear, glassy water.  

This intersection of two flooded railroad tracks branched off into several directions, RatKing explained, one direction leading to a loading dock and past that, undeveloped mine and mud. Another way, blocked by untold tons of shattered shale and limestone- but his favorite direction from here was through the abandoned food storehouse.
Kurt and Jane looked at each other in amazement at this sprawling junction, considering its different pathways. The gleam in their eyes and a grins across their faces was almost enough to light the dark without their flashlights. The pair were nearly salivating at how the mine continued to open up further to them, the deeper they went into it, and the possibilities beyond the pathways before them. 
They let RatKing lead them over the tracks, skipping over the cab of the forklift, using it as a rusty stepping stone over the cold, clear water, and feeling the metallic clang of the metal travel through their boots and up their legs. RatKing walked through a wide doorway, pushing aside the filthy brown plastic flaps that separated the railway junction from the next room. Kurt followed behind him, and was immediately hit by one of the worst smells he had ever experienced. His eyes watered and he gagged, as if he had run face first into a solid wall of stench and it smashed into all of his sinuses at once. 

“Christ, what the fuck is that?” he retched, as Jane came in behind him and didn’t even have time to be confused before she had the same reaction Kurt did. 
RatKing laughed, but his nose was wrinkled in disgust too.

“I told you; this is the food storage! This is where the fire started, and everything has been left to rot down here ever since. Hell of a thing, right?” he reminded them, the gray tooth revealing itself once more.
Kurt wasn't sure if he was simply getting used to the smell, or if it was scorching out all of the olfactory nerves in his nose, but after a few moments, he got more or less used to it. His skin still crawled, and his lungs still felt dirty, but he persisted, and looked around, as they followed RatKing through the chamber. Most of the foods were dried goods, including powdered milk, some grains, and several crates full of Ms. Butterworth syrup, which had separated into layers of something that no longer resembled syrup. All of these were once organized into neat rows and sections, but this was no longer the case. Ash covered everything, and many of the palettes of goods had fallen over, and some crates split open, creating a maze of filth. Kurt couldn't quite tell exactly where the fire started, but he assumed they were close to it, since ash covered all of the foodstuffs, and the ground, and coated the rocky ceiling in a matte black finish. 

On the ground, Kurt was surprised to see dozens of mice. Most of them were white, and darted in between the rows of rotten food, in and out of the holes they had gnawed into the bags and crates. There must be enough of this stuff down here to feed them for centuries, Kurt thought. He wondered if any of them had ever seen daylight before, as he watched several of their small shapes dart away from the beam of his flashlight, and into the nearest dark nook. Their tiny paw prints dotted the ashy floor. 

Kurt looked down at them as they walked, before he abruptly stopped again, and said to the others, “Y'all see this shit too?”

“Yeah! How many generations of mice do you think have lived down here?” Jane wondered. 

“Well, yeah, that, but also,” Kurt pointed his light at the floor, “That.”

Jane and RatKing followed his beam. There, leading away from the direction they were headed, and deeper into the food storage, was a set of bare human footprints in the black ash. 

“What the fuck?” Jane shuddered. 

Kurt turned again to RatKing, seeing the razorblade tattoo above his brow raised in a question. RatKing looked back at him, and shrugged. 
“Those definitely aren't mine,” he assured them.

“I'd hope not. What sort of fuckin lunatic would come down here barefoot?” 

“Not me. Dunno why they would, but, we're almost at the coolest part of the tour. Just a bit farther.”

Jane walked a bit closer to Kurt as RatKing continued showing them the way. They hadn't seen any evidence that there was anyone else in the dark with them that they weren't aware of, but this place wasn't the fresh crack that they had believed it to be. Someone else had been down here, and it was now a bit more unnerving to consider who, or when. The hike to the sinkhole from the gas station felt pretty long, and the hike this deep down into the mine was long and fairly treacherous. If they met an unfriendly stranger, they both knew, the lack of cell phone reception through the tons of rock over their heads would make it even harder to find help, but RatKing promised them that the best was yet to come, and what they had seen thus far convinced them that it was more than worth the risk of running into a barefoot freak. 

That is, until they thought they heard the distant sound of one sharp cough, as if someone, somewhere were trying to clear their throat. Kurt and Jane immediately clicked their lights off, and Kurt grabbed RatKing’s arm, holding a finger to his lips, and signaling him to do the same. He went still and turned off his light too. The three of them crouched down, not moving, ears straining. The darkness was suffocating, and the smell of the millions of pounds of rotten food was still hard to ignore. They saw no other lights in the infinite black, and the only sounds to be heard were their heartbeats pulsing in their ears, and the squeaking of the blind mice around them. 
After a tense few moments, RatKing whispered, “What’d you guys hear?”

“Pretty sure someone coughed, but I'm not sure where,” Kurt whispered back. 

“Sounded far,” Jane added. 

“Sure it wasn't the mice?” 

“Pretty sure.”

RatKing sighed, sounding impatient. He wasn't being loud at all, but the sound still reverberated off the rock walls. 

“So what do you guys wanna do?” he asked them.  
Kurt grimaced, and, after brief consideration, told the train hopper, “There’s no way in fuck it's a cop all the way down here, so I’m gonna call out. If whoever is out there is friendly, they'll make themselves known.”
Kurt stood, balancing himself by putting his hand on the huge bag of powdered milk next to him. He could smell its sour stink, and even though he couldn't see it in the dark, he knew the grit that came off onto his hand was black ash. 

“Hello?” Kurt called into the blind dark. It echoed back from all over the limestone chamber, and down every corridor.

“We ain't cops! Just exploring! We know you're out there! It's all good!” he continued, his voice filling the void surrounding them once more. 

Silence. Only the squeaking and scampering of mice, and a steady drip of water into a distant stygian pool could be heard.

“Fuck this,” Jane said, louder than a whisper, and half to herself. 

“I'm getting some bad vibes right now, man. There's definitely someone else down here, and we've also been walking for a while. I'm worried that if we push deeper this time, we won't be able to find our way back out,” Kurt said. 

He could almost hear RatKing rolling his eyes in the dark. 

“Nah, come on, I know my way around down here pretty well. There's nothing to worry about,” RatKing insisted. 

“No,” Jane said, speaking sharply through the silence, making both men jump, “I have a bad feeling about this too. Let's come back to this place some other time.” 

She stood and turned on her flashlight. It was briefly blinding after being smothered by the void for the minute or so they had been on alert. The three of them were about halfway through the rancid maze, and Jane began walking back in the direction of the doorway they'd come through. Kurt followed her. 
“Alright, fine. I think you guys are overreacting to some fucking footprints and a destroyed bathroom, but whatever,” RatKing complained, shaking his head, and moving to follow them. 

They were almost back to the filthy plastic flaps of the doorway that led to the railway. Jane was a bit ahead of Kurt, and continued to walk as he turned around to face RatKing. 

“Do you really not think anything is off here? There's another person down here somewhere, and they've been here awhile based on the amount of shit in that toilet. You can roll the dice and fight whatever rat-person is in this mine if you want, but I wanna come back when I've collected myself and gotten more familiar with this labyrinth of tunnels. I doubt it's going anywhere,” Kurt said to him, anger edging into his voice. He already didn't quite trust the stranger, but now, he decided, RatKing was being a douchebag. 
“Even if there was someone down here, so what? He fucks around, I'll beat his ass. You guys are freaking out. Do you need a beer or something?” RatKing said back, his tone making it obvious that he wasn't truly being diplomatic. 

“Ya know, you might like getting fucked up when you're doing risky shit, but I prefer to keep a clear head, and right now, it's telling me-”
Behind Kurt, Jane yelped, and her light clattered to the filthy cement floor. Kurt whipped around, just in time to see the multiple pairs of grimy hands reach through the blackened plastic curtains and wrap around her arms and face. They swiftly yanked her off her feet and pulled her into the darkness on the other side. 

“JANE!” Kurt cried, the anger in his voice now overwhelmed entirely by fear and panic. 

His right hand went to the hilt of the knife on his left hip as he tried to dash forward, but he was held back by the arm that suddenly wrapped around his neck. RatKing had dropped his light and jumped on Kurt's back, embracing him in a stranglehold. His arm coiled tightly around Kurt's trachea, doing his best to squeeze the life out of him. Kurt tried to twist his body free of the death grip, fumbling to get the knife out of its sheath as he did so. By the time he ripped the black blade free of the leather, he was already seeing spots, but he knew he had a chance now. 
He thrusted the blade over his left shoulder, trying to catch the face or the eye socket of his assailant, but RatKing weaved his head out of the way, pulling the both of them to the ground, himself beneath Kurt, who flailed wildly on top of him, choking and straining, doing his best to kill for just one gasp of the vile air, even though, a moment ago, he had been thinking about what he would do to breath any other air on the planet. 

Kurt almost dropped the knife in his frenzy as his hands grew clumsy, and the ash-blackened ceiling above him began to resemble a night sky as stars sparkled across his vision. He thrust it repeatedly behind his back in a less-than-elegant fashion, multiple times missing his mark and hitting the cold stone floor beneath them as RatKing squirmed out of the way of the wild stabs. He wasn't willing to release his hold on Kurt, until the blade struck flesh. RatKing winced in pain, once, twice- then groaned- then gasped- and finally loosened his grip enough for Kurt to get one solid gulp of stinking air, and pry the punk’s arm off of him. 

He clumsily rolled to the side, trying to come to his knees and then on to his feet, but almost fell back again as he struggled to draw air into his lungs. He coughed and sputtered, the metallic edge of his knife now stained red along half its length, and pointed back towards RatKing, who was attempting to scramble away, holding his stomach with one hand, the white cotton of his wifebeater darkening with blood beneath it as he dragged himself out of the beams of the fallen flashlights streaking across the floor, his eyes wide with panic as the desperate struggle had turned against him. 

Kurt lurched towards him as fast as he could manage, pulling himself up as he groped across the bags of grain and generations of mouse droppings next to him, bringing him to his still-unsteady feet as he struggled to get more air into his lungs, determined not to let his adversary slip away into the shadows like the other rodents in the cavern. Kurt sucked down another deep breath, and, now standing over the wounded man, drew his foot back, and sent the steel toe of his boot into RatKing's face as he cried for help. The black leather boot shattered RatKing's teeth with a wet crack as his head snapped back, and his body went limp. Kurt wasn't sure if he killed him, and he didn't care right now. He had to get to Jane. Who had just snatched her? 

He turned in time to see one of her assailant’s fists smash into his face, knocking him back against the palette of foodstuffs, and putting stars in his eyes once more. Another pair of hands grabbed his wrist and twisted it, wrenching the KA-BAR free of his grip. It clattered to the ground as another blow struck him in the temple, and another to his stomach, as the hands on his wrist pulled him over and forced him to the ground, his cheek bouncing off the cement, and his wheezing breath sucking foul ash into his mouth as he coughed and spat. 

“Fuck, don't kill him!” a voice shouted. To Kurt's weakened consciousness, it sounded like he was underwater. 

“But look what he did to Tyler! The fuck you think I'm gonna do?” an angry man’s voice argued, sputtering slightly, speaking just a bit faster than the mouth that formed the words was designed to move. A foot pressed down between Kurt’s shoulder blades, forcing a gasp out of him. Blood ran from somewhere on his face, and into his eye. 

“No- it's up to the Veiled One! He might want this one too!”

A snarling sigh from above, and a kick to Kurt’s stomach. He coughed and wheezed more, trying to curl into a fetal position. One of the people shining a light in his battered face had snatched up his knife, and he didn't know where Jane was. He shuddered to think of what these people had in store for her. 
Scabby, filthy hands roughly fastened his own with zip ties behind his back before his strength could return to him. He said nothing as they dragged him through the ash and into the darkness. 

Through the haze of pain that still clouded his brain, a clear thought shined through: I'm gonna find Jane and get her out of here, even if it kills me. His eye that wasn't swelling shut darted to the figures who had him by the arms on either side, and were taking him to god-knows-where. 

If they hurt her, he swore to himself, I'm gonna make them pay. ",0,1762272572.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

Whereas coffee tends to have an alternative name such as kaff, kafe, etc etc.

Obviously, I am now struggling to think of more examples - but I'm convinced this is a trend!

Wondering if people had thoughts on why this is and any more examples?

My current theory is ""tea"" seems to be relating to anything brewed (nettle tea etc.) whereas coffee is specifically coffee beans so needs to be renamed to a fantasy-adjacent beverage.

It could also simply be a language thing too I guess.

At Day a Corporate Professional, Night, a Sensual Masseur. How I got my first client.

So I was working a corporate job at Delhi since 2016(around 2 years) but still, My earning was very limited So I was thinking about earning some extra money. So I decided to do some extra work which can help me to make money and have fun also. I decided to be a Male Masseur and provide Body Massage Only to Ladies in Delhi at their home as well as Call Boy (PLAYBOY).

But that was not so easy and I had no idea about how to start the journey, I went to several Spas But not succeeded. So I posted several classified and ads about My services on some sites like Vivastreet and Skokka and Locanto.

And that thing worked for me. I got several calls from Females for home service. A lady also called me to discuss massage. She wanted to have a massage at her place. we discussed it on the phone.

She wanted to try my Body Massage service. So she asked me to meet at Rajeev Chauk, Delhi. I said I need to go to my room to bring some stuff to give you better service but she said today I just want to meet you over coffee and want to talk about some personal things after that I will let you know when I will be ready for your service. I said Ok. I left my office and took the metro for rajeev chauk.

I reached at Rajeev Chauk Metro Station, after 45 minutes and Called her. She picked and said that she was stuck in traffic and she will reach there in 10 minutes. I was waiting suddenly a Lady with a Car stopped in front of me and Said ""Lucky??"" Right?

I said ""Yes"" and sat in the Car.

I was feeling glad to see her because She was a damn beautiful and pretty lady. her boobs size was 36, the waist was 30, and the ass was 38 We left for CCD.

We reached and Ordered Coffee than she started talking about her, she told me that She is a working woman and doing a well-paid job in the government sector. she also told me about her married life and husband. She said: ""My husband belongs to a very high profile family and his father is working in HCS( Haryana Civil Services) But her husband is unemployed and also a traditional boring person. He sleeps at 7.30 PM. He never talks to me and also doesn't like to listen to me. He spent my salary and I have no issue with this but he doesn't care about What I want. He never pampers me"". She became emotional and The tears started flowing from her eyes. I said, ""Calm down"". I understood what she wants. She also asked about myself, my profession, and my education. I told her everything about myself. Then she said I need some relaxation from this type of stress. I want a good listener who can listen to me and understand my emotions. i want a hug and want to kiss someone. I want someone who can pamper me.

I was listening very carefully..but her emotions became limitless. So I said, Please Calm down. This place is not good to talk about such things. We should go somewhere else so that we can sort out these things and I will give you everything whatever you want to have from my side.

We have talked about Many things and Now she trusted me because I just saw her face and eyes and tell her that what she wanted. She told me all these things that she wanted to say to someone. She was very happy now because she found a good listener as she wanted.

She was happy to hear that I understood her feelings.

So she said, let's go somewhere else. After some time see bring me at one of her places.

She relaxed on her sofa and started talking again and started crying. After a few minutes of listening to her. I said don't weep please and let me make you relax.

We went to her bed than she said it's very weird and strange for me. But I hold her hand. And said don't worry I will make it comfortable for you.

She said ""It's a very weird feeling for me, i never did these things with another man, and then she closed her eyes.

I put my lips on her lips and started kissing and she was also smooching me. Slowly I was kissing on her neck and licking her shoulder and neck area.she was moaning and said it's tickling. Please lick my whole body I love it when you are doing this. So I started licking her neck again and slowly I push her left side boob so she stopped me.

She said"" Not Now. I love Slowly""

So I sucked her Tongue and bite slowly on her neck. she moaned loudly. and then I ask her to remove her top. She removed her top. She wore a red bra. I started licking on her backside and started biting on behind her neck. and slowly I push her boobs. this time she holds my other hand and started pushing her another boob with my hand. then I laid down and pulled me upon her. then i started sucking her nipples one by one. she was moaning louder and louder and slowly I started rubbing her thighs which makes her turn ON and I insert my hand into her panty. She was terribly Wet. I started fingering on her pussy and i found her g spot and started rubbing. she was moaning too loudly and after sucking and fingering her around 20 minutes, she squirted.

Than I started kissing and licking her waist and navel and than I reached at her pussy and i spread the clitoris and insert my tongue into her pussy and started licking. She again started moaning and started moving her butt.

I inserted my tongue deep into her pussy and licked G spot which makes her turn on. and after 20 minutes of licking, She said "" I can't tolerate more, Please fuck me now""

Then I put her legs on my shoulder and insert my dick slowly. It was little hard but the pussy was wet so i inserted my dick into her pussy in one time. She started shouting and ask me to hold on.

I stopped and waited for a minute and than she said""now fuck me"". and i started fucking. after fucking of 5 minutes in this position, She said""I want to sit on your dick""

and She came to my dick and sat on it and started moving. Now she was enjoying more and I was also enjoying too much  and she also started kissing me.

She did this at 10 minutes and than she said to fuck in Doggy style. I fucked her in Doggy style as well.

We enjoyed a lot on that day. it was 12, O Clock and she said now you should go. Se booked a Cab for me and gave me 1000 rs also.

I said what is it for, I didn't give you Body Massage?? She said You need money , I need love. Please keep it..and Next time I will call you for Body Massage than I will cut the money from your service and also blinked at me.

1oob803,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1oob803/christmas_2025_the_year_the_pine_cone_grew/,CHRISTMAS 2025 - The year the pine cone grew,"I started an email for me son when he was born and send him random emails and stories about life.    I plan on giving him the email when he turns 18.    Sent this to him this morning and my eyes are filled with tears.   It has been one hell of a year.....


It all began when we picked up the Walmart Christmas toy catalog during one of our shopping trips. You spotted it right away, sitting by the entrance, and your face lit up like it was already Christmas morning. A few days later, we found the Sam’s Club catalog too, and just like that, your holiday excitement began to grow.

Then one day, the Amazon catalog arrived in the mail. You were so thrilled to open it, flipping through each glossy page filled with toys, games, and surprises. Suddenly our coffee table was completely covered in catalogs, each one filled with possibilities.
But we were still missing one. You wanted the Target catalog, and so began our little adventure. We went from store to store, searching the aisles and asking at customer service desks, until finally we found one. It felt like a Christmas treasure hunt, and when we brought that last catalog home, you held it close like it was something truly special.

Ever since then, you have looked through those catalogs every single day, studying each page, circling your favorite toys, and trying to decide what Santa should bring. Watching you reminds me so much of when I was your age, lying on the floor with the JCPenney Christmas catalog, dreaming about what might appear under the tree.

This year feels extra special. It is the first year we started decorating on November 1st. The pumpkins were barely gone before we began bringing out the boxes of lights, garlands, and ornaments. We are taking it slow, one little decoration at a time, letting the house fill with that cozy, magical feeling that only Christmas brings.

I remember how long the Christmas season felt when I was little, how it seemed to stretch on forever in the most wonderful way. I want your childhood to feel like that too — full of anticipation, sparkle, and wonder.

We also started a new tradition this year: planting our Christmas tree. We brought one of our big potted plant buckets inside, filled it with soil, and let you and Stevie each pick out a pine cone to “plant.” You pressed it into the dirt carefully, poured just enough water, and made a little wish that it would grow overnight.

And the next morning, when you woke up, something magical had happened. Right there in the bucket stood a beautiful Christmas tree. You looked at it in pure amazement and said with the biggest smile, “It worked!” I will never forget that moment. It was the perfect mix of wonder and belief — the heart of what Christmas truly is.

Every night now, you open the fireplace door and talk about making cookies and milk for Santa. You always remind us not to forget the carrot chips for the reindeer. You keep checking your catalogs, just to be sure Santa knows exactly what you’re hoping for.
The lights twinkle softly, the stockings are ready, and our “planted” Christmas tree stands proudly by the window, a symbol of the magic that can grow from even the smallest pine cone.

I hope you will remember Christmas 2025 for a very long time. Because this was the year when you discovered that a little imagination, a little love, and a lot of belief can make Christmas truly magical.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

having my gf with me, this trip wasnt tourist kind of visit but rather a local experience. stayed in sinchon so everywhre was pretty close. we went (mapo gu, seogyo, itaewon, banpo) to cyber cafes, photo booths, clubs n pubs, local streetwear shops n coffee, eating ramen at the convenience stores, walk between neighbourhoods, and so on. skipped itaewon on friday cuz its on a halloween night but went there on sat. I LOVE IT. off all the places there, we went to Badass HipHop Bar. Exceptional music btw. AND THE pharmacy!!! gf told me tht korea has every remedy for hangover!! Love that. decided to visit Han River at night (stupid idea cuz it was 0° and we only wore 2 layers 😂) and it was so beautiful. 

no bad experience at all! had no encounters of racism or discrimination. although i was taken aback abit about the ppl spitting here. maybe its the cold but they would charge up loudly before spitting, and they didnt even bother to hide it 🤣

1oob6qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkViperAU/comments/1oob6qw/the_thing_i_will_take_from_this_tgg_situation_is/,The thing I will take from this TGG situation is what Para-social actually means,"I let myself get wrapped up in the TGG is Matt's other girlfriend or adopted kid, too.  I loved at the ending to the Wanted video when TGG was frustrated, tired, and ticked off from Kray \[I think\] running him all around the lifeguard tower \[was it\]. But when he saw matt giving up you could hear the relief in his voice and it warmed my heart. 

  
But that's it. That's why John Williams and Ennio Morricone get the big bucks. It's how you cry at the end of EdgeRunners. And, it's why seeing just the opening to Expidition33 I knew I'd be playing with a box of Kleenex. \[Still need to do that\] I'm a softie. 



But I don't know Matthew Judge and better than I know Ben Starr. 

  
Ok, that is not entirely true. I know a lot more about Matt but it is to stress, I know what matt has shown.  Time and time again Matt has welcomed me into his personal life.  When Times were rough for and when they were good. When he was right and when he was wrong.  At every turn I feel I have found wisdom and truth in his words, and a request to reach out and mend fences and apologize in a real and sincere way whenever necessary. 

  
*This thing i did \[pause for clip\]. I should have have done that. It was wrong and I was wrong for it.*

  
Every time I see another controversy with Matt pop up I worry, this will be that one that makes him quit YouTube.  I'm too old \[embarrassingly so\] to care this much about a guy with The Mask Glitchless World Record. But people also follow sports figures for 3 years investing hours on numbers, graphs and more just to watch a ball on TV as reward.  



I have gained so much more from Matt then he can ever know.  You remember when John Cena apologized to China?  My first reaction was how dumb and weak it was. You call the bad government out for bad things.

Latter that same week I turned Rambles on YouTube and this cake-punching-goof-ball changed my mind in just a few words.  Forgive me as memory is what it is, but basically Matt said John obviously did not believe his apology but this apology would help keep the jobs of several hundred people.  John did stand up to power and the demand for that apology showed the continued foolishness of the Chinese Government.  For this trouble China got a weak apology that wouldn’t satisfy China but would work to save many jobs.

  
He showed me a diffrent way to look at it and it softened my view of John in the situation. In that same Rambles video he mentioned how he's not trying to change minds anymore because it's pointless.  I commented at the irony of him doing it in this very Ramble video with out trying.  Matt's logic is not perfect but it is reasoned and thought out. 

  
I will never know Matt but I know I am thankful for his wisdom and advice over the years.  his analytical nature on everything from clipping into a wall to an apology an actor made, shows me his care and attention to detail for reasoned thought in every argument he presents.  He brings complete context with receipts, and when he gets it wrong, even slightly \[Trevor's mom and illusion - Gatterkeys\], he calls it out, publicly with receipts for that too. 

  
All of this to say I will continue to support Matt. Buy the plushies and hell, I think I need some Gamer Subs after this \[Use Code: DarkViperAU to save at checkout\], and maybe a new coffee cup too. 

  
But I will do so know it is still a Para-social relationship.  I can and do still love and support Matt and his content for more then five years now.  But I also know our relationship is a story I tell myself and no more real then I am to Matt.  

We are both humans, that are spinning on opposite sides of a water covered rock in space at the same time. I'm very lucky for that and have benefited immensely. But he can only know me for a few chant entries and my Reddit memes and I can only know him from YouTube.

My weed habit worsened to an addiction and I began smoking practically as soon as my eyes opened every morning. Of course, this became a consistent problem at the store clerk job I’d managed to find and my manager regularly chewed me out for being high on the job, but he was barely less apathetic towards the dead-end job than me, so nothing came of it for a while.

I don’t know what Laney knew, but I’m sure she guessed. She came to visit a couple of times just to get away, but she didn't have much time after school started back up following their spring break, so I tried to go to hers when I could. While I could still sense a lingering trace of sadness, like the heaviness of Leo and Laney’s experience had caused them both to grow up some, it seemed that they’d grown even closer through it. They leaned on each other, even in small ways, and seemed to understand one another without words, sometimes even with just a look. Delaney’s joy wasn’t so abundant as it had been before, but I wasn’t expecting it to be. Her smile was still just as infectious though, and that haunting look of defeat was no longer in her eyes.

She didn’t like talking about the details of what had happened, so I didn’t press her. It was clear that she wanted to move forward, to look ahead, and to start living the life she’d been dreaming of. We went to her favorite diner for breakfast while I was visiting late that May and she’d dreamt to me about the future she wanted with Leo, how she wanted to fill their home with light and laughter, and to not give up on the idea of being a mother. “I know it won’t be anytime soon,” she said, cupping her mug of coffee to herself, “We both still need to heal some, I think. But what happened in February… It really made me realize what I want.”

I nodded solemnly across from her. “I get that. And I know you two will get there. You deserve to be happy.” I said, offering a small smile.

“Alright babes, I’ve got your check here but there’s no rush.” Said our waitress, flashing us a kilowatt smile. “You sure I can’t get you any more coffee before you head out?”

“I’m great, but thank you Millie.” Delaney replied and I nodded my head in agreement.

“You got it, honey. I’ll see you next week?”

“I’ll be here.” She answered warmly. I watched absentmindedly as Millie made her way past our table and back towards the kitchen when an arm shot out from a booth a few tables away and grabbed her gruffly by the arm, stopping her in her tracks. I immediately frowned and set my cup down, peering over Delaney’s shoulder and straining to hear. Delaney cocked a brow at me in a questioning look and then glanced over her shoulder, following my line of sight.

Millie smiled and laughed amicably at the man holding her arm as the guy across from him chuckled at something that was said. Both wore worn-down vests and button-ups, scruffy, unshaven faces, and distinctly unsavory expressions as they looked her up and down. My blood began boiling as Millie gave a placating laugh and made an attempt at stepping back, gesturing towards the kitchen, but the man only pulled her down into his lap, much to the obvious enjoyment of his companion. Delaney snapped her gaze back to me and a wordless exchange took place as we gathered our things in record time, each slapped some cash on the table, and bee-lined for the booth. 

“Millie, I forgot that I still have those books you lent me in my car!” Delaney said as she stepped close and offered the men a smile of acknowledgement. “Excuse me for interrupting, we’re just about to head out. Would you mind coming with me for a sec so I can get them back to you?” she directed that last part at Millie with a tilt of her head. I didn’t even attempt a poker face and glared openly at the men from behind my sister.

“Oh, Millie girl was just agreeing to sit and keep us company here.” The first man said, squeezing the arm he had wrapped around her. She said nothing and stared at the table, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.

“There’s other places to go besides a diner if you’re trying to pay someone to keep you company.” I retorted. “How about you back off and let her get back to work?”

His companion scoffed in disdain, but the man seemed to squeeze Millie’s arm harder as he glowered at me, not even pretending to hide his anger. Then, the effect lifted and he gave a friendly smile, although to me it looked more like a baring of the teeth, and raised his hands off her in surrender. I could see the white imprints of his fingertips not yet faded from her skin. “No need to be rude, girlie. Nothing wrong with being friendly.” I narrowed my eyes at him as Millie sidled off his lap and Delaney slid her arm under hers, guiding her to front of the restaurant. “Have a nice day.” I snipped over my shoulder, following them out.

“That one will have to be dealt with.” I heard one mutter into his mug. From behind my back, I thought I heard his companion respond, “by the blood of our brow”. My anger seethed behind my teeth.

“Thank you both but you really didn’t have to.” Millie said, glancing nervously back towards the table where the men sat scowling at us. “No, it’s unacceptable.” Delaney said incredulously. “I can’t believe they did that and thought it was ok. You’d think we’re back in the 70s or something.”

“I know, but really, it’s better not to make a big deal.” Millie insisted. “Those type of guys don’t really do any harm until you give them a reason to.”

“You should at least talk to your manager.” I suggested. “They could be banned and then you wouldn’t have to worry about it.”

“Look, I don’t want to lose out on the tips.” She snapped, removing her arm from Delaney’s. “I gotta get back to the kitchen. See you next week, Delaney?”

“Sure, yeah. See you later.” We watched her rush back off behind the swinging door and then exchanged confused looks. All Delaney responded with was a shrug. After we said our goodbyes outside, I glanced back through the slated windows just in time to see Millie return to the booth and sit back down with the men, and my breakfast soured in my stomach.

\~

My sister and I didn’t see much of each other that summer, but I was glad of her company when I had it - the majority of the rest of my life was gaining speed as it went steadily downhill. My days became hectic and I started working as much as I possibly could in a hail Mary attempt to eliminate my nearly crippling student loans, although things were gradually deteriorating with my manager at the store clerk job, and I habitually and idiotically spent my paychecks on weed. I’d done community college and was taking my time getting my BFA in film studies once I transferred schools so that I could work as I went, but I was no star student and got very little financial aid. As a result, I started a second job as a bartender downtown, a development that Delaney despised, although she tried her best to keep it to herself. I was grateful for the distance at that point because drinking very quickly became more than social and my new job became more than enabling. 

Whenever I did see her, I would put on a face and only tell her about the little class dramas and frustrating college projects, I’d expound only upon my future plans and show her the little sister that was making her way and standing on her own two feet, not the one that was stumbling through life and becoming a bitter disappointment. Odds are that she saw right through it, but she never said anything to me about it.  

One evening towards the end of one of my visits, Leo stepped out with me on the back deck under the pretense of getting me to put out my cigarette while Delaney finished the dishes. The crickets chirped noisily in the gathering dusk and we stood there silently for several moments just watching the little lightening bugs blink in and out of the tree in their postage stamp of a backyard. I glanced over my shoulder and verified that Laney was occupied, then held out the last of my cigarette to Leo, which he took and brought to his lips with a little tilt of his head. “My goodness, didn’t your doctor ever tell you those things will kill you?” I teased sarcastically. These moments had become somewhat of a bond between us because Leo didn’t care to police me like Laney did, and it worked out for me to let him bum one here and there since he didn’t want it to become a full-blown habit again. 

 “Eh, I’m more of a believer in ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’”. He replied with a sidelong smirk. “Listen,” he said, exhaling a cloud of hazy blue smoke, “I want to talk to you about your sister. Ever since… you know.. Well, I’ve been thinking about what I want and we’ve talked a lot about the future. She’s really the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I want to do this right. I… I want to marry her, love her for the rest of her life and give her everything she could dream of. But, I know it’s really always just been the two of you, so I wanted to get your blessing. What do you say, Cass?”

It was as though my life flashed before my eyes in that moment, but comprised only of my memories of Delaney. Us as children, sharing a seat on the bus ride to school, playing mermaids in the rundown trailer park pool, her dragging me home on our makeshift sled after I broke my arm going down a hill, the two of us inventing heinous recipes from the random half-empty ingredients we could find in the too-bare cabinets, teenagers screaming at each other for stealing clothes we never admitted to taking, her catching me smoking in my first ever boyfriend’s car, us staying up all night talking on a random swing set the night of our father’s funeral and passing a bottle of cheap vodka between us – the only time she’d ever drank with me.

I felt almost overcome in that moment by the bitterness of having to let go of her. My sister. The one person that was always there with me through everything else. But then I thought of the way she looked at him, of how happy he made her, and of her dreams for her future. I pushed the bitterness down along with the lump in my throat. 

“Of course you do, Leo. She’ll be thrilled.” I said, looking up at his grinning face. He wrapped me in another of his patented bear hugs, which he quickly broke for fear that Delaney would notice the exchange through the sliding glass door, and promised to be in touch about his plans.

\~

He proposed in their home just before that start of the new school year. He decorated the place with candles and flowers, and had picked out a gorgeous vintage ring of iridescent moonstone. She, of course, said yes and wept with excitement and emotion, all of which I captured on camera from my covert hiding place in the closet. She looked radiant that night. I think that was the last time I ever saw her truly happy like that. 

Delaney busied herself as much as possible in the weeks that followed. She threw herself back into work with the new school year, picking up coaching some extra-curriculars and tutoring late into the night when Leo was called away from home so that she didn’t have to be home alone for so long, and of course, planning their wedding that they’d set for the following fall. I didn’t see her in person for a long time and our schedules didn’t align much for phone calls either.

I distanced myself from Delaney purposefully too, knowing she would get on my case about my job and “coping mechanisms”, as I called them. I didn’t want to be lectured or looked down on, but more than anything, I didn’t want to disappoint her. She had so much going on too that I was loath to add anything to her plate. Things would have turned out so differently if I had allowed us to lean on each other; I so desperately wish that I had been there for her more during that time, that I had made time for her. I should have seen what was happening, but I was too selfish to see past my own problems, and I told myself that she had always been the stronger one anyways.

“Hey, Cass. You got a minute?” She sounded tired. It was still early autumn, but most of the leaves had already abandoned the trees and only a few clung on to the barren branches in scraggly clumps.

“Uh, yeah, I’ve got a couple. I’m just on the bus into town right now.” I replied, shoving my neglected study binder back under my crumpled shift-change clothes, cringing as I heard the papers get crushed within the over-stuffed bag. “What’s up?”

“Look,” she sighed, “I know you probably will think I’m going crazy – hell, I already think I am – but I just need to vent. I can’t keep going to Leo about it, he’s done too much already.”

“Okaaay,” I said, quirking a brow, “spit it out, what am I gonna have to tell the orderlies when I turn you in?”

“You know how sick I was over the winter and how sensitive I was to smell?”

“Yeah?”

“Well, I thought that had just been the pregnancy hormones and stuff at the time, but it’s still happening.”

“Geez, like you’re still getting sick like you were?”

“No, no, just the smells thing. I don’t know if that permanently changed my nose or something, but I keep smelling these awful smells that make me feel super nauseous and dizzy. It’s not all the time though, it usually hits me at night.”

“Ew, gross. Sorry you’re dealing with that. Think it could be something dead in your vents or something? Does Leo not smell it too?”

“That’s the thing, it’s not coming from anywhere specific in the house and I’ve even smelt it at work a couple times too. No one else has said they can smell it when it happens so I just end up looking crazy, gagging over something that no one else can smell. It’s driving me crazy.”

“Yeah, that’s weird as fuck.” I concluded. “You said you think it’s from the pregnancy?”

“Well, it could be. It can make your nose super sensitive in general, so maybe mine just never went back to normal? I don’t know, I’ve been wondering too if maybe I picked up some sort of long-form virus from the school, or maybe it’s a type of migraine? I’ve heard those can affect your senses.”

“Have you gone to your doctor about it? And what does Leo say?”

“He’s been really sweet actually – keeps bringing home different candles and air purifiers to try to help. He had the maintenance guy check the HVAC and water systems back when I was only smelling it at the house, but no dice. When I went to my GP he didn’t find anything wrong, and Leo even had me come to the hospital to run some extra tests but nothing came up from that either. I feel bad telling him about it now because I can tell he feels helpless.”

“Man, I’m sorry Laney. That sucks. So nothing’s helped at all?”

“Not so far. I’ve been trying out some supplements that Luke researched but if anything, it’s just happening more frequently. If nothing changes this month, I think I’m going to see about the migraine thing and getting some meds for that.”

“Hmm.” She sounded exhausted, I could almost see her rubbing circles in her temples.

“There’s more too.” I sensed her apprehension in telling me, I thought because she figured I’d tease her for it. “Now *don’t* laugh.” She prefaced. “It’s happened like 4 times now… I’ve been hearing footsteps.”

“What, like a haunted house?” I asked irreverently.

“Yeah, exactly. The first time, I was doing laundry in the basement and I could have sworn I heard someone walking around in the kitchen right above me. Obviously, I figured it was just Leo getting some food or whatever, but when I came up, he was sound asleep in our bedroom on the next floor.”

“Ok, and you’re sure he wasn’t just pranking you or something?”

“You know how squeaky our stairs are, there’s no way I wouldn’t have heard him go back up. Besides, he’s not the type to joke like that and he swore he had no idea. He even went around and checked the house after that just to be safe.”

“Ok, sure, that’s weird.”

“The second time, I was walking down the upstairs hallway and it was like there was an echo to my steps, you know? Like someone behind me was stepping just after I did.”

“Ewww, that’s creepy.”

“Yeah, and I was home alone that time. Gave me goosebumps and everything. Last week, it happened at work too – I was in my classroom late grading homework and setting up projects for the next day, and all of a sudden, it sounded like there was someone slowly walking towards me, barefoot on the tile floor.”

“Ugh, no way.” I said, covering my mouth at the thought. “That’s so freaky. And there was no one in there?”

“No, it was just me. And the crazy part is, our class pet hamster, Mimzy, is usually sleeping when the lights are dimmed in there, but right after that happened, she started freaking out and squeaking like crazy, running all around her cage and even straight into the walls. I’ve never heard so much as a peep from her but she was literally screeching over and over. I didn’t even know hamsters could make sounds like that. Poor little thing hit the glass so hard that she was bleeding from the mouth and she wouldn’t let me catch her. She calmed down eventually but I just felt super uneasy after that, like I wasn’t alone in the room.”

“Wow, ok well that’s insane. So, do you think you’re being haunted or something? That’s sounding straight up like a horror movie.”

“I don’t know. It’s been awful, though. And this morning it really freaked me out again. I was coming down the stairs, getting ready to leave for an early morning tutoring session and it was still dark outside and everything, and just as I was almost at the bottom, it sounded like something was literally *sprinting* down the stairs after me. Like, barreling down them full speed. I pretty much shit myself and fell against the wall, but there was nothing there. I got full body chills though, and it felt really cold in the house after that. Jetta had been laying on her tree too and she ran straight under the couch and wouldn’t come out.”

“Holy shit, Laney. You need to sage the house or something. Definitely don’t stay there on your own.”

“Yeah, I know. I told Leo about it and he suggested that we stay at his parent’s place tonight, so he’s gonna pack up Jetta and some clothes for us and come pick me up from work once school lets out.”

“That’s good, at least. I’m glad you’re not messing around with whatever’s going on.”

“Definitely not. Harold, Leo’s dad, is a pastor so I think we’ll have him come bless the house or anoint it or whatever.”

“Ok, well keep me posted then. My bus just pulled in though so I’ve gotta run.”

“Alright, will do. Thanks for listening, Cassi. Love you.”

Of course, during that entire conversation I was reminded of my own experience the last time I’d been at her house and the undeniable similarities. But she was clearly already stressed and exhausted and I didn’t want to burden her with even more to worry about. I grew to understand what a mistake that had been.

Over the next few weeks, I got more and more concerning calls from Delaney, but usually only late at night as that’s when she needed someone the most. Her health declined slowly at first, but consistently. She began suffering from chronic migraines that would strike suddenly and leave her dizzy and in full body chills, and she said she frequently felt cold, colder than could even be explained by the now crisp and frost-tinged weather. She also started having vivid nightmares almost every night, but she had a hard time remembering them once she’d woken up, which is one of the reasons she would call me so late.

“All I remember is being in this dark forest at night,” she described, “and all the trees were bare and it was completely silent. It was so cold, I still feel cold even now. I looked up and the moon was full, then all of a sudden it turned blood red and I heard this weird droning sound. Then there was a bright light, like looking directly into someone’s highbeams, and I woke up.”

She described other dreams - dark figures stalking through her home, their footsteps following just behind hers, but they were always on the edge of her vision, never fully visible. She told me of one where she was standing paralyzed in the hospital hallway and Leo was standing a few yards away, holding a bundle of bloodstained cloth that she knew was their baby. She said that he looked like he was screaming for her but she couldn’t hear him and she couldn’t even open her own mouth to respond. Then the overhead fluorescents down the hallway behind Leo began burning out one by one, showering sparks down upon the tiles as the hall was consumed by darkness. Eventually it swallowed up Leo, and then herself. 

Sometimes she would mention that her nightmares smelled of the same blood and decay that would frequently overwhelm her in waking hours but still went unnoticed by all others. She still regularly heard footsteps too, at home, at work, in public. Harold had anointed all the doorposts and prayed over the house like she’d said. She also saged and smudged the whole place, cleansed with salt and holy water, hung dream catchers and protection sigils. She started going to a therapist as well, although she told me that she often felt rather dismissed and condescended to. 

“I just hate feeling like such a freak, but I don’t know what else to do, Cass.” It was late, already the wee hours of the morning. “I tell him that I’m afraid to sleep and he just wants to up my medication. I tell him that it makes the migraines worse and he just says it’s a known side-effect. I don’t even want to tell him about the dreams or auditory stuff anymore because all he does is make a note in his stupid little book and look at me like he’s waiting for a reason to institutionalize me.”

“I thought you liked this guy better than the last one.”

“I did at first, but they’re all the same. And it’s not getting any better. I feel like I’m just going through the motions at this point so that Leo doesn’t worry I’ve given up.” She always called me on the nights when he was away working, but she’d often even call from another room when her nightmares would wake her so that she didn’t disturb his sleep even more.

“And still nothing from the doctors?”

“They finally ran the second CT scan the other day, but I haven’t gotten the results for that yet. The specialist is still refusing to order an MRI for me, which is infuriating. And yeah, other than that, it’s the same old ‘have you considered anxiety medication, what if you lost some weight, try these sleeping pills’ bullshit. It’s exhausting.”

“Are you shitting me? That’s completely ridiculous, I don’t get why they won’t just listen to you. It’s literally their job. Can’t Leo do something about it?”

“I know. I don’t know what else I can do at this point. Even when Leo goes with me, all they do is say the same things to him instead like I’m not even in the room. He’s frustrated too. He got another citation this week from the hospital board for the conflict of interest of him trying to handle my case. I can’t keep going to him anymore.  And I’m tired of researching all these other ‘solutions’. I’m just tired of all of it.”

I couldn’t blame her - she and Leo had done everything they could. Even though Leo wasn’t experiencing any symptoms, they had the house checked top to bottom for mold and carbon monoxide leaks and water purity, he’d researched furiously for possible causes, tried every number of spiritual cleansing rituals, switched their eating habits, tried all of the medical solutions the specialists begrudgingly suggested. Leo even started looking for a new house for them, but it was slow going with the market in their area. In the meantime, they would spend a couple nights a month sleeping at the homes of friends or family, or even a few hotels in the area, just to see if that gave any relief to Delaney but her condition remained mostly unchanged. She still was hardly sleeping and of course was struggling at work because of the severity of her symptoms. 

She said that people were sympathetic for a little while, but it was clear that the bizarre nature of her experiences and health issues made it hard for them to respond. She struggled to speak openly about what was going on because she could tell it made people uncomfortable, and eventually they stopped asking about it too. She would vent to me sometimes about feeling that no one cared, or the frustrations of their overstepping and offering unwelcome advice, which most often was both ignorant and insensitive. But she was kind and wouldn’t let it impact those relationships, even with my encouragement to be petty.

“It’ll get better, Laney.”

“…How?” It always scared me when I could hear the hollowness in her voice.

“I don’t know, but it will. This stuff doesn’t last forever, and you’re due some major slack from the universe by now.” She was silent on the other end for a few moments; our phone calls were often punctuated by long spells of silence when there was nothing more to say, or when being present was all that could really be done.

“You’re right.” She sighed. “I’ve got you and Leo, plus the wedding to look forward to. It’ll be ok.”



As winter approached, things only got worse. Delaney’s symptoms became stronger and she started waking to the taste of blood in her mouth, although Leo and the other doctors could see no visible cause and had no explanation for this either. She told me, too, of her now constant headaches and the way her eyes would burn like she was staring at the sun. She was so tormented by her nightmares that she slept as little as she could and often relied on me to either calm her down or keep her awake. I’m sorry to say it, but I grew to truly resent her; each time I was jarred from sleep at the sound of my ringer and saw her name on the caller ID, it was like another drop of anger was added to some internal jar that welled up inside me. Of course, I never *wanted* her to feel like a burden or that she was unimportant to me, but I couldn’t help being overwhelmed by the constant need to support her at all times, and the lack of any forward progress on her part was difficult to bear as well. I felt awful every time I would snap at her, especially when she would be so apologetic and placative, but I wasn’t prepared to be practically her entire support system all by myself or for the consequences it had on my own life. 

I struggled with my tasks at work and started falling asleep on the job. My boss gave me numerous warnings, probably a good deal more than he should have, but that grace eventually ran out too and I was let go from the store clerk job the week after Halloween. My irritation at my sister increased exponentially at that point and I started ignoring some of her calls entirely. Leo’s too. I was so torn by guilt that I couldn’t sleep most nights anyway, but I couldn’t overcome the rage that had brewed up within me. As a result, I abandoned her when she needed me most. I will never forgive myself for that.

Drinking was no longer the social device I told people it was, and very quickly it became more than even a weekend blackout. I would get drunk at my bartender job until I was fired from that too, after which I would stock up on the cheapest liquor I could find and drink it straight almost every night, until the hangovers became so tiresome that I would day drink too. Even with my miniscule workload, I skipped classes and had no mind to absorb the material of the lectures I did attend, so my progress at college stalled pretty much completely. Only one semester left, too. I self-medicated my growing depression with shitty nights out with shitty friends, ending most weekends with shitty sex with strangers that I never wanted to see again. 

I spiraled deep into my own darkness and drank away my severance. Things became even more strained between Delaney, Leo, and I. She didn’t reach out hardly at all and when she did, she was less forthcoming with the details of what was going on with her, although it’s not as though I could have even been there for her with how unrelentingly and irrationally irritated I became at even the sound of her voice. Part of it was also my shame at how badly I was failing in my own life - I didn’t want her to know, to see me like that, to look at me the way she had looked at our father. She would ask questions about me and how I was doing, and I would berate her about prying in my business and pretending to care. I knew it hurt her to hear those things. I don’t know why I said them and I wish so much, Delaney, that I could take it back.

When Leo would call and ask if I was alright or if there was any way I could come for a visit or just check up on Delaney, I would give him half-assed excuses and hang up at the earliest opportunity. When I wasn’t angry, I was numb. I preferred it that way, and so I would drink and smoke and do whatever mindless bullshit I could think of. I didn’t go to their place for Thanksgiving. I didn’t even return Delaney’s voicemail when she invited me. That’s part of the reason why it took me so long to realize she’d gone missing.",0,1762272234.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

**Host:** Jason Wade, Founder of [NinjaAI.com](https://NinjaAI.com) & [AIMainStreets.com](https://AIMainStreets.com)

**Duration:** \~9 minutes





**\[0:00\] — Introduction: The Shift in Local Marketing**

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping how local businesses connect with their communities.

The AI GEO Framework — short for *Artificial Intelligence Geographical Optimization* — gives small businesses the power to act like data-driven enterprises.





**\[1:15\] — The Big Idea: Data-Driven Local Power**

Imagine a Lakeland coffee shop adjusting its Google Ads in real time as morning commuters drive by.

That’s the precision the AI GEO Framework delivers — local intelligence that acts faster than intuition.





**\[2:30\] — How It Works: AI, Location, and Prediction**

It combines AI, location data, and predictive analytics.

The system reads patterns in customer movement and digital behavior, then transforms them into instant marketing actions.

Example: when “lawn care near me” spikes after a rainstorm, the AI GEO engine automatically reallocates ad spend to that neighborhood.





**\[4:00\] — Accessibility: Leveling the Field for Small Businesses**

Small business owners don’t need to be data scientists.

AI tools now automate the heavy lifting — analyzing Google Maps data, reviews, and check-ins to suggest where to focus next.

It’s what we teach at NinjaAI.com and AIMainStreets.com: visibility through automation.





**\[5:20\] — Case Study: Grove Café, Winter Haven**

Grove Café used AI GEO targeting for early commuters — and doubled breakfast sales within weeks.

Simple timing, smarter targeting, zero guesswork.





**\[6:40\] — Predictive Marketing in Action**

In Orlando, fitness studios use AI GEO systems to forecast membership demand — often based on local events, weather, or even seasonal motivation cycles.





**\[7:45\] — The Compounding Effect**

Every click, check-in, and review makes the system smarter.

The longer you run it, the more it understands your audience. That’s compounding intelligence — the new competitive moat.





**\[8:30\] — Closing Thought: Smarter Beats Bigger**

Whether you’re a Tampa florist, a Lakeland HVAC tech, or a Winter Haven boutique owner — the AI GEO Framework turns your data into your strongest marketing asset.

The future of local business isn’t about being bigger. It’s about being smarter.

1oob03q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1oob03q/did_i_do_the_right_thing_by_blocking_him/,Did I do the right thing by blocking him?,"I broke up with my ex about over a month ago, and then proceeded to call him a week later saying I regret it, let’s get back together, to which he said he doesn’t want to, because he doesn’t want to get hurt again, and I’ve been neglectful of his needs in the relationship before, to the point where he’d pick fights just for my attention, anyway, a week later I called him and asked if we could meet up, he said it’s over and asked me not to call him ever again. Just for context he’s anxiously attached and I’ve some avoidant tendencies, so I thought since he’s asked me not to call him again, I won’t, and went out of town for a vacation, post vacation he sent me a reel, saying, this reminded me of you. I replied haha true, and left the conversation there. Then he started posting sad cryptic statues on WhatsApp only I could see, cross checked with friends, and they confirmed it didn’t show up for them. A week or so after that, I met up a male friend of mine for coffee at a cafe my ex claimed was his fav spot. And his bestf saw us, and told my ex. My ex drunk/rage texted me that night saying, I’m an evil person, and I couldn’t even wait a week before being seen out with another guy , while he was waiting patiently for the dust to settle between us and blocked me. 
Then I gave him some space for a week, and my sister called him and tried to explain that it wasn’t a date, just a friend. He unblocked me later. I texted him, hi, how’s he been, he texted back with anger and resented, saying stuff like he won’t be my back up option and stuff. So I just calmly said it was a friend, nothing more. And left the conversation.  
I texted him again after a week, hoping he must’ve calmed down a bit and we could have a proper conversation, asked him if he was still waiting on us? He replied with sarcasm, saying stuff like I’m going to jail, enjoy your life with your new person, and the same rant about how cruel I’m.
Then I stopped reaching out altogether. 
 I was very confused during this time, about him wanting to be together or us breaking up for real, because he would say it’s a breakup and not mean it, he has done this before. So my bestf texted him to clear it out, he said he’d speak to me and then one night apparently he called me, but I’d forgotten that he’d blocked him after one of the arguments, he told my friend that it’s over for good, he wanted to take me for a drive and talk it out, but it’s done now, asked me to move on. I texted him, thanks for the clarity, wishing you well.
Then again, he’d post some statues mirroring mine, statues only I could see. 
But I didn’t react. However one day I was out and he was near my place and we bumped into each other, I asked if we could talk he was hesitant at first but agreed and we went for a drive in his car. He ranted angrily how he was losing so much sleep that he started losing hair and had to get a wig, then he said how could I do that to him, he hates me for it, and I’ve lost him forever. I apologised and didn’t say much then he dropped me off. One day I went to see him at his work, i was missing him, he smiled like a kid when he saw me, he complimented me, said I looked nice, other men must love seeing me, we hugged and I told him I wanted to fix it, he said no he has made up his mind, also asked me not to show up at his work when he’s trying so hard to move on and that he’s seeing multiple other people. Later that night, I texted him, I get that you’re done, and I’ve tried enough, I’m letting go now, especially since you’re seeing other people and that’s a boundary I don’t want to cross. He replied within a min picked a fight with me saying I was a hypocrite for losing it all just because he mentioned other people and when he used to say he has a problem with my male friends I didn’t do anything about it. I called him out that friendship and seeing people are two different things. He argued with some baseless points, and I had, had enough. So after that argument I blocked him everywhere.

He’s up 10-12x throughout the night with watery stools. Working at his job very little. 4 small children. A wonderful wife but he’s getting extremely discouraged. He has an appointment with his GI tomorrow. He’s eliminated the majority of caffeine except for an occasional cup of coffee. Very limited sugar intake. Any words of encouragement or recommendations of how to proceed or what to ask his dr? I’d gladly trade places with him if possible.

I’m currently considering the Outin Nano with the additional basket kit and a stand. I like that it’s automatic and can make good coffee, though I’m not completely sure how great it really is. Maybe someone has other devices in mind that make great coffee at home with 100-200$ budget. What do you think?

My friend Kyle 31M started a coffee cart in April called Dockside Beans. At a bbq he asked if I could help with “a quick logo, nothing fancy, just vibes”. I said sure, I can do a friends rate if we have a brief and a deadline. He waved his hand and said we’d settle it once he launched. We did two sit downs at Starbucks, I sketched on my iPad, then moved to Figma. I sent three options, he picked one, requested tweaks, color codes and a black white version for stamps. Total time was around 14 hours across two weeks. I told him my friends rate is 25 per hour, half of my normal. He said cool and asked for the source files so the printer could do cups and a vinyl wrap.



Two weeks later I see my design on a sandwich board, on Instagram ads, on a square flag, on hoodies. He tagged me as “our creative genius” but never brought up payment again. When I nudged him, he texted “I’m cash poor rn, can we do gift cards”. I said a partial is fine and sent an itemized invoice for 350, 14 hours, plus 18 for two test prints, due in 30 days. He stopped replying. I ran into him at the cart, he handed me a free latte and said we’re even. I said no, I appreciate the drink, but an invoice is an invoice. Last week my design appeared on a POPUP banner and on his Square reader screen. I emailed a final notice, then a take down request to the printer with my proof of authorship. The printer paused his next order. Now he’s blasting me in our friend group chat saying I’m torpedoing his small business and that friends dont nickel and dime. One mutual said I should have just gifted it since I “got exposure”. My rent does not accept exposure. Kyle’s girlfriend dm’d me to say I embarrassed him and I could have asked privately, even though I had, for a month.



I feel gross about involving the printer but also I’m tired of being the free design fairy. AITA for invoicing and asking the printer to pause new merch until he pays or at least sets up a plan

### Context/History: This is my 2nd marathon. My first was 9 years ago (MCM) where I ran a 2:53:32 a year after college and no preparation other than high mileage easy runs. I finished feeling amazing and planned to run many more marathons, but I’ve battled constant injuries that have prevented me from getting to the start line (very frustrating) and I had two kids in 2019 and 2020 which really threw my body off for a few years (still ran but no racing). Finally tried a first half marathon in Sept 2023 and won (Harrisburg Half in 1:21:32)…then was out of running for 7-8 weeks with a blown up ITB and hamstring tendon near right knee. Healed and got one good Pfitz 12/70 block and ran NYC Half 2024 in 1:19:53 and left with sharp right obturator pain. Worked through it and tore the top of my left groin a month later. Took time off running, worked back in with some level of pain for summer 2024 but felt good about my training (another Pfitz 12/70) for NYC Marathon 2024. As soon as my left groin pain was fully gone in Sept 2024, I tore my right adductor in the middle of an easy run and ultimately deferred my NYC Marathon entry as I could not run at all. Took a long time in PT to heal. Bought the Lever for the Tread and used it all of December 2024 to slowly work back into running. Removed the Lever and did regular tread running January into mid-February (I had been afraid to run in the dark with the icy winter as I didn’t want to rip my groin again). Finally got to outdoor running by the end of February and my right adductor/groin pain started to officially dissipate. Ran the Brooklyn Half in a 1:21:35. I hadn’t done any workouts (just stuck toneasy runs and building my long run) and I was just proud to finish. Took a week off since my right hamstring had strained less than a week before the half and needed TLC. Light running in June. Raced my first 5k in 12 years on 4th of July and got a course record which was fun. Kept up with easy runs and rebuilding the long run as a bace before NYC Marathon 2025 training, but the injury train started by mid-July. My left foot and ankle were wonky so I took a few days to cross-train, ran four days on the treadmill to test it and got back outside only to find my left ITB was hurting like hell (but foot was fine). Started going to PT and running was touch and go by early August.
Placeholder text!

### Training: minimal - so I am very confused by my race result?! I was going to loosely follow Pfitz 12/70 but it never happened. On the same day I found out I got into Puma Project3 for the race, my left outer ankle shit the bed on me mid-easy run. Couldn’t run for 8 days and yes I went to PT and even a foot/ankle ortho appt. As I got back to running, the left ankle was better if taped but the left ITB pain was back to play and it hurt like hell along my lateral leg, impacting the outer quad and hammy. I was getting graston scraped at PT which gave some relief but trying to keep running was painful. After running on it for 3.5 weeks, my body finally had enough and was compensating. My right outer ankle started to get crappy and then I felt like I was tearing the bottom of my right quad/adductor area. So I cross-trained the last 2 weeks of September. Tried a short run-walk on Oct 1st and although my left ITB was fine, I had a ton of nerve pain along the bottom of the left outer hammy and top of calf. Wondered if I herniated a disc for the third time in my life but the pain pattern felt different and it ultimately dissipated with PT. But on Oct 5th, I was on a light run and my right outer ankle popped out of knowhere and I hobbled home. Couldn’t run for a full week. Are we having fun yet? Told myself I get one last shot to work back into running and if something takes me out, I am not running the NYC marathon. I was scared to go out for every run. Both outer ankles would make it through the run but I’d limp the rest of the day. On Wednesday before the race, my right ankle felt scary after the run so I decided to commit to no running Thurs/Fri/Sat before the race and just show up and see what happens (which was scary AF)!
Placeholder text!

### Pre-race: Drove 3hrs to NYC w/ husband and kids on Friday and arrived at 5pm. Met up w/ my parents and went to dinner. Got up Sat morning and used the hotel bike for a light sweat. Both outer ankles were sketchy. Picked up my gear bag at the Puma store. Spent too much money on my kids at the Lego and MLB store. Went to the race expo and back to the hotel to put my feet up. Went to dinner and told my family and friends that I was only mentally prepared to early DNF due to ankle injury. Told them how I sorry I was that they were on this trip for me and it was likely going to be a big fail. Went to sleep around 10pm and got up at 4:30am. Got dressed and had water and a quick cup of coffee. My dad walked me to the sub-elite bus two blocks away. It was very cool to get the police escort to Staten Island. We arrived at the indoor Ocean Breeze Complex with the pros. I drank more water and coffee. Met some really nice women to chat with. Did a 400m jog on the indoor track and thought “yeah I can at least start this race.” Did a few dynamic warm-up drills. We re-boarded the bus and got dropped off at the start line. We got to put all of our stuff in a van which would bring them for pick-up at the finish line. Used the bathroom one last time. Started my music and put my phone in my Koala clip behind my sports bra (phone was on SOS and music wouldn’t play). Elite men we t off and they loaded us right up on the start mat in the Blue Corral. Gun went off and my music immediately started!

### Race: I probably don’t remember much my mileage chunks so I’ll give a general overview. I never looked at my watch so I definitely didn’t do manual laps so my splits above are from the Coros watch (GPS was probs inaccurate at times). I figured I would just keep running and see what happens. I could tell both ankles were not healthy and I told myself if I just keep smiling, my ankles can’t fail me. Bless my dad’s heart, he took an hour subway ride to be at Mile 4 to cheer me on in case I only made it that far. His screaming really cheered me up. I fed off the energy from the crowds, had friends and family cheering for me throughout Brooklyn. I repeated mantras in my head of “pain is just a visitor” and “you were built for this” and kept moving. I was feeling good other than being weary of my ankle tendons. They do not like hills but the rest of my body is pretty strong uphill. I told myself to make it past mile 16 where my husband, kids, and mom were cheering. It gave me more energy to see them. I smiled the whole way up 5th Ave. My right adductor was a tightrope by then but I could tell it wasn’t going to take me out. I cried a little when I saw the I-87 sign for Albany in the Bronx as it made me think of my deceased grandparents. When I got back into Manhattans, both ankles really started to fail as evidenced by my splits. They couldn’t push off well so I shuffled them forward. Told myself once i was at Mile 24, there was no other option but to finish. My family cheered me on again at this stretch and if it weren’t for my ankles, the rest of my body was ready to speed up. I had no idea what pace I was running so when I saw a 2:47 on the clock with 200m to go, I was in shock. I never expected to get the $3k from Puma for PRing by 3+ minutes. I didn’t even picture finishing!

### Post-race: You may have noticed I did not mention fuel during the race. I will get murdered for this, but I didn’t take in any water, no fuel, no nothing during this race because I didn’t get to train properly and I didn’t practice it. Not condoning it by any means and I absolutely want to get healthy so I can have consistent training and practice it. Anyway, I couldn’t move my ankles after I finished but a kind volunteer dragged me to the pro/semi-elite finish tent. I went to their medical team and had them ice and tightly tape both ankles. They put me in a wheelchair to get me out of Central Park. My husband came up to 69th street to retrieve me from the wheelchair. It was too crowded and hailing a can was impossible so I leaned on him and hobbled down to a bar on 57th street to meet the rest of my family. Downed a beer and we left for home (my kids are 6 and 5 and were so ready to go home). The only thing that hurts are my ankles and the right one is coming around! The left one is pretty bad so I am going to rest up and go back to PT. It feels nice to not have the pressure of needing to get to a start line now. But I’d love to see what kind of marathon time I can run w/ the following: a flatter course, healthy ankle tendons, consistent uninterrupted running, fueling and water during the race. Better not take me 9 more years to run another marathon! If you stayed this long, thanks for reading.

### TLDR: if you have a long history of running, you may be able to have a really poor training block with a lack of running and still come away with a PR.

I’m 27F, live about 35 minutes from BigCity Intl and 55 from the budget airport. I’ve somehow become The Airport Person for my whole family. My mom texts “can you take me at 4,20am?” my cousin asks for a 11,50pm pickup bc “Uber is surge rn”, my older brother sends flight numbers with zero hello, like I’m dispatch. I used to do it happily, I like my family and I drive a reliable Honda. But it’s stacked up. Gas here is 4,39 a gallon, airport parking is 18 per hr if I have to wait, tolls are 5,80 one way. Last month I did 7 trips. Two were back to back and I sat in the cell lot for 90 minutes because my brother checked a bag full of souvenir rocks, I wish I was joking. I was late to a dentist appt and paid the missed appt fee, 50 buck. When I brought it up, my aunt laughed and said “you’re so sweet, our little shuttle”. Not sweet, just tired.



I told everyone I need notice and that sometimes I cant. They still ask same day. Mom once put me in a group chat with her church friend I’ve never met to arrange a 5am drop off bc “she’s nervous to Uber”. I caved and did it. After that I wrote down real costs. For a typical round trip to BigCity it’s 2 hrs driving, around 20 in gas, 6 in tolls, plus time. So I made a Calendly link with the times I’m actually free, and a small fee, 25 to cover gas and coffee and hey maybe my time matters. I also said if they book less than 24 hrs I will likely say no and they should plan Uber or the train.



Mom said I’m being transactional and that family should help. Brother called me greedy and asked if I’m broke, then posted a story from the Delta lounge eating free snacks. My cousin quietly Venmo’d me 25 for last time and said she gets it. If I send the link to the family chat and stick to it, would I be the asshole

1ooaj1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/myhappyv/comments/1ooaj1o/irritationdysuriadiscomfort_for_months_cannot/,"Irritation/dysuria/discomfort for months, cannot figure out the problem","In the past year I’ve had about 4 or 5 UTIs, last week I had my first yeast infection, and in between all of that I have general discomfort. My gyno referred me to a urogyno but it is a few months out. She wasn’t terribly concerned. I’m in my mid 20s and thought I was well educated on keeping myself healthy down there, but I feel so lost and embarrassed. 

Basically, my discomfort while urinating is usually light as well as the feeling of needing to pee never quite going away. Sometimes it gets more intense, sometimes it disappears. It has made sex uncomfortable. My partner is ftm, so we can go without penetration, but it’s definitely a strain on our sex life. We’ve tried a bunch of different toys, lubes, etc, but nothing has helped. It only hurts around the entrance, but it is so uncomfortable. Ever since this started, I have vaginal dryness. I think it’s because I dread the pain. After sex it gets worse for a day or so. My discharge is normal, a little thick and white when I walk around all day, but I feel like it has always been that way. I have a ton of discharge when I ovulate, sometimes with a little blood. I use a menstrual cup and sometimes it smells foul towards the end and it definitely irritated me around the entrance last time. I have no clue what of this information is relevant. 

My other thoughts for consideration: 

1. I take half of a maximum d-mannose supplement daily, but I haven’t noticed a difference. 

2. I drink a lot of irritants, and about 30ml of water on average daily. I’ll have a coffee, some water, and then a coke. I also eat a lot of sugar. It feels insane that this could all be from that, though. 

3. I have a ton of tension in my body. Though I try to relax, I do wonder if that can be contributing. 

4. Beyond being overweight and eating probably too much sugar, I have no reason to think I am diabetic. I’ve had tests in the past year that have been all good and have no physical signs. 

5. I may have pelvic floor damage from sex, but could that have caused a year’s worth of discomfort? 

6. I think I remember having elevated leukocytes on most of my urine tests, idk what that means. 

7. I have blood work confirming there is slight inflammation in my body, but I’m not sure what it is. It could be autoimmune. 

8. I had what my doctors have decided is a false positive for hsv2. Barely there numbers and no symptoms. No STIs otherwise, my partner and I were both tested at the beginning of our relationship. We had a threesome recently, but he was also tested and I don’t feel like the symptoms have changed. 

Please if anyone has any ideas, let me know. I’m super desperate. I’m so upset and worried about this all the time and I feel like it has sucked a lot of the fun out of my life. ",2,1762270994.0,myhappyv,0,1.0,False

His current guide dog is nearing retirement and he is unsure which breed he wants to try next based on his lifestyle. 

He currently works from home and 70% of the time, his dog is just a regular dog or works occasionally for things like walking to the doctor's office or to a coffee shop, etc. 

However, we are both very active so the other 30% of the work is relatively challenging, particularly for our vacations which include things like long hikes over a few days, or being tourists in cities, and lots of flying. We have been to national parks as well as various European cities, both for a week, and our current dog worked the entire time without needing mental or physical breaks. 

His current dog is his first guide dog, and first dog ever. The dog is a Fidelco Shepherd who is great for the 30% work on our vacations. He wants to work, and even after long bouts of not working when we are home for long periods of time, the dog always on point and ready to go go go! But for our day to day lives, he definitely gets bored and as much as we play with him or excersize him, he is definitely underutilized and needs to work. To be fair, we've been told he is extremely high energy even for other fidelco shepherds, this by other blind friends who have had fidelco shepherds in the past and have dogsat ours for a weekend. Even after a week of guiding my partner through Europe every day on a vacation, we would get back to the hotel and the dog would be like... So... frisbee though? 

Anyway, so now my partner is considering his next breed and isn't sure what is best.

He is considering a lab but we have heard labs are more chill and happy to work or not work, and are not as intense as shepherds, for lack of a better word. We aren't sure how they will hold up needing to constantly switch between the two extremes of our lifestyle. 

He has heard of collies as guide dogs but we don't really know enough about them. 

What has your experiences been with different breeds and do you have any advice or guidance? ",0,1762270942.0,Blind,0,0.5,False

I am 29F, work hybrid, my sister Lena is 32 with two kids, 6 and 3. Back in March I said I could help with an occasional morning when daycare was closed, like once in a while, no big deal. Somehow occasional turned into Lena showing up at 5,40am, key in hand, dropping the kids in their pjs on my couch and sprinting out before I can even find my glasses. She texts “you’re a lifesaver, tysm” and I’m standing there making toast and finding tiny socks before my own meetings start. I love my niblings, I just dont love that my coffee is now cold every single weekday. I tried boundaries, I really did. I said please ask first, I said not on Tuesdays, I said I have a presentation. Next morning, guess who rang my bell at 5,38 with a “quick favor, promise it’s last time”. It wasnt.



Last week the 3yo spilled yogurt into my laptop keyboard, the 6yo used my dry erase markers on the wall because “auntie said she likes color” and I missed a 9am client call bc someone was crying about a missing blue cup. Lena got mad that I sounded grumpy, said family helps family and that I’m single so my time is more flexible, which is such a nice way to say my time is free. So I sat down and did math. Extra food, cleaning, new keyboard, two Uber rides because I couldnt drive while both kids melted down, 1 hour of lost freelance time on two days. I made an itemized invoice for 312,47 and emailed it with a cheerful “hey, this is what this support costs, happy to keep helping if we schedule and you cover expenses”.



She blew up in the family chat, called me heartless and transactional. Mom says I should apologize, dad quietly venmo’d me 50 with a thumbs up emoji. Lena says she will not pay “a cent to my own sister” and also that she needs me again this Friday bc daycare is doing a training day. I replied that I’m not available without prior confirmation and prepayment, she sent a long text about me gatekeeping childcare and how the kids will be sad. Now everyone is acting like I invoiced a stranger, not someone who keeps ignoring every boundary I state. AITA for putting a price on my time after months of being used like a 24,7 drop off spot

Yeah, same. Most people hate small talk but secretly wish they were good at it. Social anxiety is super common, especially in our hyper-online world where DMs feel safer than real-life convos. The problem is, we weren’t meant to live behind screens. We’re wired for face-to-face interaction. But if you’re like most people, no one *ever* taught you how to talk to strangers without sounding robotic or feeling like you're bothering them.

So this post is for anyone who wants to feel more confident, less awkward, and actually enjoy conversations with people they don’t know. It’s built from real research, books, and podcasts (not TikTok bros yelling “just be alpha”). These are practical tools, not generic fluff. You don’t need to be born charming. You can *learn* how to make others feel at ease, and that’s the real cheat code.

Here’s what actually works:

- Most people are too busy worrying about themselves to judge you. Dr. Laurie Santos, in *The Happiness Lab* podcast, shares research showing we wildly overestimate how much others are thinking about us. It’s called the ""spotlight effect."" Once you realize no one’s analyzing your every word like a reality TV judge, talking gets easier.

- The #1 social skill? Curiosity. In *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards (behavioral researcher), she breaks down how high performers in social settings ask thoughtful, open-ended questions. Try: “What’s been keeping you busy lately?” over “What do you do?” Feels less transactional, more human.

- Silence isn’t a threat. It's breathing room. Studies from MIT’s Human Dynamics Lab found that powerful conversations have natural pauses. They’re not awkward unless *you* decide they are. Treat them like a beat in a song, not dead air.

- People like people who like them. Dale Carnegie said it back in 1936 in *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, and modern neuroscience agrees. Mirror neurons light up when we feel understood. So if someone talks about something they love, lean in. That energy is contagious.

- Warm beats witty every time. You don’t need clever one-liners. What matters more is tone, eye contact, and presence. A study from the University of California, Berkeley, found that people rated strangers as more trustworthy based on warmth, *not* competence. So stop trying to impress. Make them feel safe instead.

- Use the 2-second rule. When you see someone you might talk to, don’t overthink it. Count to 2, then go. Mel Robbins’ *5 Second Rule* works the same way, action beats anxiety. If you wait too long, your brain will flood with reasons to stay quiet.

- Stack small wins. Confidence isn’t a personality trait. It’s a skill built from repeated exposure. Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy talks about “power posing,” but the real takeaway is: your body shapes your mind. Stand tall before you speak. Your posture changes your self-talk.

- Start with shared context. At events, use the environment. “How do you know the host?” “Tried the coffee yet?” This shifts you from stranger to familiar. Your brain loves familiarity. So does theirs. It lowers social threat.

- Pre-rehearse your openers. This isn’t about being fake, it’s like stretching before the gym. Prepare 2-3 friendly lines you can use in most places. Example: “This line’s taking forever, huh?” or “I always feel underdressed at these things.” It’s not what you say, it’s that you *say* something.

- Don’t aim for “perfect,” aim for “present.” In *Think Again*, Adam Grant explains that people prefer those who are authentically imperfect over those who try to come off as flawless. You’re allowed to stumble. It makes you relatable.

- Learn to exit gracefully. Say something like, “It’s been great chatting with you, I’m gonna grab a drink but let’s continue this later.” Ending a convo well makes you more confident about starting one next time.

- Social momentum matters. The more strangers you say hi to, the easier it gets. The first one of the day is always the hardest. Don’t warm up with your phone. Warm up with a person.

- You’re not “bad” at talking. You’re just *rusty*. Social skills are muscles, not traits. Dr. Andrew Huberman’s lab at Stanford emphasizes neural plasticity. You *can* rewire your brain to associate social interaction with reward, not stress.

- Record your convos mentally, not emotionally. After a chat, don’t spiral. Just run a quick check: Did I listen? Did they smile? Cool. That’s enough. Most people won’t remember your awkward phrasing. They’ll remember how you made them feel.

- Practice in low-stakes settings. Cashiers, baristas, Uber drivers. These mini-conversations build reps. They don’t require deep charisma, just presence. Over time, you’ll naturally level up.

- Social anxiety lies to you. It tells you you’re boring, annoying, or in the way. But research from the University of Chicago showed people consistently *underestimated* how much strangers enjoyed their company. People want connection. They’re just waiting for someone to go first.

- Want a cheat code phrase? Try “Hey, I’m trying to get better at not being glued to my phone at events, mind if I say hi?” You’d be surprised how many people smile and say “thank you for that.”

This stuff takes time. But it’s all learnable. And it’s way better than waiting for confidence to magically show up. Talk first. Confidence comes after.",1,1762270825.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

1ooae6h,https://i.redd.it/cfomb28389zf1.png,We Built the Fastest-Growing CRM in Our Industry With Zero VC Money. Our Secret? Digital Real Estate.,"# While Everyone is Panicking About Traffic, Smart Businesses Are Counting Their Money

While everyone is panicking about declining traffic numbers, they're missing the most important metric: **conversion rates are through the roof for AI-referred traffic.**

A comprehensive study tracking companies investing in both traditional SEO and AI optimization revealed something shocking. The AI platforms weren't driving even 1% of the traffic. Sounds bad, right?

Wrong.

Look at the conversion numbers: **AI was responsible for 9.7% of revenue in B2B companies and 11.4% in B2C companies.**

Read that again. Less than 1% of traffic. Nearly 10 to 12% of revenue.

""It's like fishing with dynamite versus fishing with a net,"" says Mike Vidan, Co-Founder of QuoteIQ, the fastest-growing CRM in the field service industry. ""Traditional SEO casts a wide net and hopes for the best. AI search is surgical. The people finding you through ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Google's AI Overview aren't just browsing. They're researching with intent. They've already done the homework. When they click, they're ready to buy.""

The data backs this up. Most LLM users aren't even researching products or services initially. They're in the discovery phase. But when they do research products, approximately 14% or more are actually purchasing, either in-store or directly on the website. In B2B scenarios, it's mainly direct website conversions.

The conversion channel doesn't even show up properly in traditional analytics because people conduct their research on AI platforms before they ever click through or visit your website. They arrive pre-qualified, pre-educated, and pre-sold.

# The Cost Reality: Stop Burning Money on Google Ads

Let's talk numbers, because this is where most businesses are hemorrhaging cash.

According to recent industry data:



* Small businesses spend $1,000 to $10,000 per month on Google Ads
* The average starting budget for SMBs is $1,000 to $2,500 monthly
* Average cost per lead across all industries: $70.11
* Legal and financial services: $100+ per click
* Even ""cheap"" industries: $1.47 to $2.41 per click



Do the math. At $2,000 per month, you're spending $24,000 annually on traffic that vanishes the second you stop paying. And with AI Overview now appearing on 30% of searches, your ad might be pushed so far down the page that it's practically invisible anyway.

Now compare that to the BudgetBuilt approach: **Four ultra-focused, AI-optimized websites at less than $35 per month each = $140 per month or $1,680 annually.**

You're spending **93% less** than the average Google Ads budget while building assets that:



* Never disappear
* Compound in value over time
* Generate organic, high-converting traffic
* Get cited in AI Overviews
* Rank in traditional search
* Own their specific niche or geographic market



""Look, I get it. Everyone loves the instant gratification of paid ads,"" says Vidan. ""You turn on the money faucet, traffic flows in. You turn it off, traffic stops. It's predictable. It's also stupid expensive and completely temporary. These websites? They're digital real estate. They appreciate. They generate passive income. They work while you sleep. It's the difference between renting and owning.""

# What Changed? Google's AI Overview Rewrote the Rules

Here's what most people still don't understand. Google's AI Overview has fundamentally changed search visibility.

AI Overviews now appear in approximately 30% of all U.S. desktop searches. That number skyrocketed by 474.9% year-over-year on mobile devices. Some queries are triggering AI summaries 53% of the time, especially for longer, more natural search queries.

When an AI Overview appears, click-through rates to traditional websites drop by 34.5% on average. Some publishers are reporting traffic declines of up to 70%. Even education giant Chegg saw a 49% decline in non-subscriber traffic between January 2024 and January 2025.

But here's the critical part that changes everything.

# The ""Above the Fold"" Revolution

AI Overviews don't just appear at the top of search results. They appear **above everything**:



* Above paid ads (yes, even the ones you're spending $5,000+ per month on)
* Above the coveted ""map pack"" that local businesses spent years fighting for
* Above featured snippets
* Above organic results
* Above basically everything else on the page



When you're cited in an AI Overview, you're in what industry experts are calling ""Position Zero Plus."" It's the most valuable real estate in search history. And unlike paid ads that disappear the moment your budget runs dry, citations in AI Overviews are organic, permanent, and compound in value over time.

# The Multi-Site Strategy: Own Your Market's Digital Real Estate

This is where the game changes entirely. Instead of having one monolithic website trying to rank for everything, smart businesses are deploying multiple highly-focused websites, each optimized for ultra-niche services or hyper-local geographic markets.

Think about it this way: Would you rather have one Swiss Army knife or a complete toolbox with specialized tools for every job?

**For service businesses:** Create separate websites for each core service offering



* One site for emergency plumbing
* Another for bathroom remodeling
* A third for commercial plumbing services



**For local businesses:** Create location-specific sites



* One for Downtown Chicago
* Another for Lincoln Park
* A third for Wicker Park



**For brokerages:** Create niche-focused sites



* One for first-time homebuyers
* Another for luxury properties
* A third for investment properties



""We saw that we couldn't compete with our huge competitors who had hundreds of millions in venture capital infusion and private equity money helping them spend hundreds of thousands on advertising every month,"" explains Vidan. ""So we did what any sane person would do. We reverse-engineered the entire system and broke it. That's how we turned QuoteIQ from a startup in a garage into the fastest-growing CRM in our space while companies with 100x our budget watched in confusion.""

Justin Rogers, Vidan's co-founder at QuoteIQ, adds: ""Traditional businesses are trying to be everything to everyone with one website. That's like opening one store and expecting customers from 50 miles away to drive past your competitors just to reach you. It doesn't make sense. In the digital world, you can have 'storefronts' in every neighborhood, each perfectly tailored to that audience.""

These laser-focused websites have several massive advantages:



1. **They rank faster.** A website dedicated to ""emergency water heater repair in Austin"" will outrank a general plumbing website every single time.
2. **They get cited more often in AI.** LLMs prefer authoritative, focused sources over generalist content.
3. **They appear in AI Overview.** The holy grail of modern search visibility.
4. **They convert better.** Visitors find exactly what they're searching for immediately.
5. **They can outrank sites that have been around forever.** Domain age matters less when your content is perfectly matched to the query.



# The QuoteIQ Story: When Non-Tech Mavericks Outmaneuver Silicon Valley Giants

Before we get to BudgetBuilt, you need to understand who Mike Vidan and Justin Rogers actually are. Because their story is the blueprint for everything they teach.

Three years ago, two guys with zero traditional tech backgrounds decided to build a CRM for the field service and home service industry. Not improve an existing one. Not add features to what was already there. Build one from scratch.

The audacity alone should have gotten them laughed out of every room they walked into.

The market was already dominated by established players with tens of millions in funding, hundreds of employees, and decade-long head starts. Companies that had spent years building brand recognition, customer bases, and distribution networks. Companies that, on paper, should have crushed QuoteIQ before it even got off the ground.

Three years later, QuoteIQ is the fastest-growing CRM in the field service and home service industry.

Not ""one of the fastest."" **The** fastest.

""People told us we were insane,"" Vidan recalls. ""They'd look at us like we just announced we were going to compete with Microsoft using a laptop and a prayer. The funny thing is, that's basically what we did.""

Rogers adds: ""We didn't have Silicon Valley connections. We didn't have venture capital. We didn't have a tech pedigree. What we had was a better understanding of what field service businesses actually needed, and the willingness to move faster than companies with 200-person product teams.""

Here's where it gets really interesting.

Those industry titans that should have been laughing at them? They're not laughing anymore. They're copying. Feature by feature. Strategy by strategy. Marketing angle by marketing angle.

""It's the highest form of flattery,"" Vidan says with a grin. ""When companies with nine-figure valuations start reverse-engineering what two bootstrapped guys from \[location\] are doing, you know you hit something real.""

The QuoteIQ playbook became the blueprint others followed:



* Hyper-focused niche targeting instead of being everything to everyone
* AI-first product architecture when others were still debating if AI was a fad
* Obsessive customer experience when competitors were focused on enterprise contracts
* Aggressive content marketing when others relied on paid acquisition
* Community building when competitors treated customers as license numbers



But the real secret weapon? Digital real estate strategy.

While competitors burned through millions on Google Ads and trade show booths, Vidan and Rogers built an empire of niche websites. Each one laser-focused on a specific service vertical or geographic market. Each one optimized for the emerging AI search landscape. Each one generating high-intent leads that converted like crazy.

""The big players had bigger budgets, bigger teams, bigger everything,"" Rogers explains. ""But they were playing the old game. We built for the game that was coming. When AI search exploded, we were already positioned perfectly. They're still trying to catch up.""

# The BudgetBuilt Solution: AI Website Builder for the AI Search Era

This brings us to the second act of the story. When Vidan and Rogers couldn't compete with industry titans on advertising spend, they built something different: an AI website builder specifically designed for AI search visibility and citation.

The platform creates fully-optimized, content-rich websites in under 10 minutes. Not template garbage. Actual, substantial websites with structured data, semantic markup, entity optimization, and content architected for LLM consumption.

""We built it to be attainable and affordable for any business regardless of size,"" Rogers explains. ""Enterprise-level SEO strategy and implementation at a price point that makes sense for a local coffee shop or a solo real estate agent. Less than $35 per month. That's what? A tank of gas? A couple of Chipotle burritos?""

The technical architecture includes:



* **Schema markup** optimized for knowledge graph integration
* **Entity-relationship modeling** that helps AI understand your business context
* **Semantic HTML** that LLMs can parse efficiently
* **Natural language optimization** for conversational queries
* **Structured data** that feeds directly into AI training
* **Topic clustering** that establishes topical authority
* **Internal linking architecture** that reinforces expertise signals



""Traditional websites are optimized for human readers and Google's crawler,"" Vidan notes. ""That's fine. But AI doesn't read like humans or crawl like traditional bots. It consumes content differently, evaluates authority differently, and makes citation decisions based on completely different factors. We optimized for that.""

The result? Websites that rank faster, get cited more often, and appear in AI Overviews with remarkable consistency.

# The Compound Effect: Digital Assets That Appreciate

Here's the long-term play that most businesses miss entirely.

Google Ads spending in 2024: $264.59 billion globally. That's billions of dollars that vanished the moment the ad campaigns ended. Zero residual value. Zero long-term asset creation. Just... gone.

Meanwhile, websites (real, substantive, authoritative websites) compound in value. Each piece of content adds to your authority. Each citation in an AI Overview increases your visibility. Each backlink strengthens your domain. Each month of existence adds to your perceived trustworthiness.

Rogers puts it this way: ""A website is like a fruit tree. Year one, you plant it. Year two, it grows. Year three, it produces fruit. Year five, you're harvesting baskets of fruit with minimal effort. Google Ads is like buying fruit at the store every week. Sure, you get immediate results, but you're never building anything that lasts.""

Recent data shows that AI-referred traffic, while lower in volume, demonstrates:



* **23% lower bounce rates** than traditional search traffic
* **41% longer time on site**
* **Higher exploration rates** across multiple pages
* **Significantly better conversion rates**



This isn't about choosing between paid ads and organic websites. It's about understanding that in 2025, if you're not training AI to think like you, it's quoting your competitors instead.

# The ""AI Search Domination"" Playbook

After QuoteIQ's rapid growth trajectory (going from garage startup to industry disruptor in just three years, competing against and often beating industry titans with 100x their marketing budget), people started asking questions. How were they doing it? What was the strategy? How did two non-tech guys build the fastest-growing CRM in a saturated market?

Vidan and Rogers decided to lay it all out in a comprehensive training program called **AI Search Domination**.

""We're not gatekeeping this,"" Vidan says. ""The market is big enough for everyone who's willing to adapt. The ones who'll lose are the ones who keep doing what they've always done and expecting different results. We want more David and Goliath stories. We want more bootstrapped founders embarrassing venture-backed competitors.""

The program covers:



* How to identify ultra-niche markets worth targeting
* Geographic market analysis for local domination
* Content architecture for LLM citation
* Entity optimization strategies
* Structured data implementation
* Semantic search optimization
* Multi-site management workflows
* Analytics for AI traffic (which doesn't show up in traditional GA4)
* Conversion optimization for high-intent AI referrals
* Long-term scaling strategies



""It's the exact playbook we used,"" Rogers confirms. ""No theory. No fluff. Just the actual tactical implementation that took us from competing with massive budgets to outranking them with a fraction of the spend.""

# The Bottom Line: Adapt or Disappear

The internet has fundamentally changed. AI isn't coming. It's here, it's dominant, and it's rewriting the rules of digital visibility.

Three years ago, two non-tech mavericks took on an entire industry and won. Not because they had the biggest budget. Not because they had Silicon Valley backing. Not because they had decades of experience.

They won because they understood something fundamental: the game was changing, and the old players were too invested in the old rules to see it coming.

Now those same giants are scrambling to copy what Vidan and Rogers figured out years ago. But here's the thing about first-mover advantage in a paradigm shift: by the time everyone else catches on, you're already three moves ahead.

You have two choices:

**Option 1:** Keep doing what you've been doing. Keep spending thousands per month on Google Ads that are being pushed below AI Overviews. Keep watching your organic traffic decline as AI answers questions without sending traffic your way. Keep hoping the old playbook will somehow start working again. Be the company that gets disrupted.

**Option 2:** Embrace the new paradigm. Own your market's digital real estate with multiple, laser-focused websites. Get cited in AI Overviews. Capture the high-converting AI traffic that's pre-qualified and ready to buy. Build assets that appreciate rather than expenses that evaporate. Be the disruptor.

""The businesses that are going to dominate the next decade aren't the ones with the biggest ad budgets,"" Vidan concludes. ""They're the ones who understand that AI search is fundamentally different, requires fundamentally different strategies, and rewards those who adapt first. We proved that with QuoteIQ. Now we're handing you the exact playbook.""

The digital real estate land grab is happening right now. The question isn't whether you should own multiple properties in your market. The question is: how much market share are you willing to give away to competitors who figured this out before you did?

History repeats itself. Three years from now, will you be the incumbent wondering how some scrappy upstart ate your lunch? Or will you be the one forcing billion-dollar companies to copy your strategy?

1ooae3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ooae3w/defensive_driving_a_pilot_story/,Defensive driving a pilot story,"Inspired by a fighter driving an armoured car against Isis

When the alarms began to scream across the orbital city of Erbil-9, Captain Ako Rahman was under his ship, wrist-deep in hydraulic oil.

He had never liked the new maintenance droids. Too delicate, too polite, too useless when something actually broke. The Beast—that’s what he called her—was older than the colony itself. She was a squat, ugly freighter refitted for salvage runs, her hull blackened by plasma scoring, her engines rebuilt from mismatched human and alien tech. Everyone said she should’ve been scrapped decades ago. Ako disagreed.

“She’s got heart,” he’d tell the dockyard kids who came to watch him work. “She leaks, she curses, she flies. That’s all you need.”

The alarms rose in pitch—an ugly, pulsing wail that made the metal walls tremble. Then came the voice of the station AI, calm and terrible:

> “Priority alert. Hostile incursion detected. All civilians to emergency shelters immediately.”

Ako froze. His wrench slipped, clattering against the deck. He turned toward the open bay doors, where the black curve of space shimmered beyond the docking ring. Out there, something burned—a line of light against the void. Then another. Ships, descending. Dozens.

The Zhenar. Raiders from the outer systems. No mercy, no prisoners.

Within seconds, the comm-net exploded with voices: panicked shouts, distress calls, screams. Ako looked at his ship, her hull patched and pitted, her nameplate barely legible under layers of soot.

He whispered, “Not today.”

The Beast roared to life like an animal waking from hibernation. Her old ion drives coughed blue light into the dock as Ako slammed through the preflight checks by instinct. The station’s defense grid was already lighting up, spraying plasma fire toward the incoming ships—but it wouldn’t be enough. The Zhenar ships were fast, sleek, and cruel, built for slaughter.

Ako’s hands flew over the controls. He didn’t think about protocol. He didn’t think about survival. He thought about the colony below—the families, the children, the mechanics who trusted him to fix their lifters, the old market where he’d spent his paychecks on bad coffee and laughter.

He thought: If I don’t move, no one will.

> “Station Control, this is freighter Beast. I’m going in to extract civilians from the lower sectors.”

“Negative, Beast. All non-combat ships are ordered to remain docked—”

“Too late.”



The Beast shot free of her moorings, her thrusters howling. The sudden acceleration slammed Ako into his seat. He grinned despite the pressure. The ship’s hull shook as debris scraped her sides. She dove through the chaos—past shuttles spinning out of control, past broken defense drones. The station’s lower rings were already aflame, a halo of wreckage and smoke.

Ako opened a local channel. “Anyone alive in the lower residential ring, mark your location. I’ve got a ship and poor judgment.”

A dozen signals blinked on his display.

The lower residential ring was a maze of wreckage. Power conduits sparked across shattered corridors; loose cargo containers spun in zero-G. Ako threaded the Beast through them with the grace of a drunk dancer. Every twist of the stick, every thrust adjustment, came from decades of muscle memory.

He wasn’t flying a ship—he was driving it, like the roads of old Earth were still beneath his wheels. His hands were light, his instincts sharp. When a plasma bolt tore past the viewport, he didn’t flinch. He dropped the Beast sideways, let the bolt carve through an abandoned fuel pod, then used the explosion’s shockwave to spin around a collapsing maintenance tunnel.

Three survivors clung to the edge of an airlock, waving frantic flares. Ako hit the retro-thrusters hard, flipped the ship belly-first, and opened the cargo ramp.

> “Get in!” he barked over comms. “If you can walk, crawl, or swear, get in!”



They tumbled aboard. One of them—a child, maybe ten—stared at the bulkhead, eyes wide at the ship’s patchwork walls.

“What is this thing?” she asked.

Ako smirked. “A bad idea that works.”

He sealed the ramp, throttled up, and punched the engines. The Beast tore away from the collapsing section just as it blew apart behind them, pressure vents screaming into the void.


Ako didn’t have shields. The Beast’s emitter coils were twenty years past their prime, and the only armor she had was whatever scrap Ako had welded onto her belly. But he’d learned a few tricks over the years.

He killed his transponder—make yourself invisible before they decide you’re prey.
He flew low—stay in the debris field, let the chaos hide you.
And when he had to fight—never fly straight.

When the first Zhenar fighter swooped down, its cannons glowing blue, Ako flipped the Beast end-over-end. The plasma bolts seared past where his engines had been a half-second earlier. He slammed the throttle to full, skidding along the outer hull of the station itself, the freighter’s landing gear scraping sparks from the metal.

The Zhenar pilot followed, confident, faster, sleeker. Ako muttered to his ship, “Come on, girl, one more trick.”

He dove toward a shattered reactor conduit. The Zhenar followed, firing. Ako cut engines completely and let inertia carry him through the tunnel. When the fighter fired again, the plasma bolt hit the conduit behind him.

The explosion tore the Zhenar apart. The Beast shuddered, rolled, and came out the other side, black smoke trailing.

Ako chuckled. “Defensive driving, lesson one: let the other guy overtake the bomb.”

The child in the co-pilot seat blinked up at him. “You’re crazy.”

He winked. “You’re welcome.”

There were more calls for help. Always more. Ako dropped the survivors at an undamaged docking ring, refueled with whatever the automated systems would give him, and dove back into the storm.

He found a crippled transport with fifty people trapped inside, its air supply dwindling. He couldn’t dock; the hatches were mangled. So he bumped them—literally, ramming the Beast’s starboard side into the transport to create a pressure seal with his improvised docking rig.

The impact nearly tore his hull apart, but it worked. The evacuees poured through the temporary corridor, one by one. Ako watched his pressure readings drop, his hull alarms blink red, and said, “We’re not dead yet, so stop complaining.”

When another Zhenar corvette appeared, blocking the exit corridor, Ako didn’t run. He charged.

He threw the Beast into full burn, aimed straight at the enemy ship’s forward viewport. The corvette fired—once, twice—plasma bolts splashing off the freighter’s forward armor. The Beast’s plating peeled like bark. Ako’s console exploded in sparks.

At the last possible second, he hit the side thrusters and swung the ship in a brutal sideways roll. The Beast scraped across the corvette’s hull, shredding off antennae, turrets, anything fragile. Metal screamed. Ako used the friction to spin himself back toward the safe corridor, his hull now a smoking ruin.

In the aft cameras, the corvette drifted, crippled. Ako’s heart hammered.

He whispered, “Lesson two: don’t dodge. Drive through


By the time Ako made his fourth rescue, his ship was barely holding together. Half the lights on the control panel were dead. The cabin smelled of ozone and fear. The survivors crowded in the cargo bay, whispering prayers in half a dozen languages.

Ako floated a few ration packs their way and said, “Eat up. Might be our last meal before breakfast.”

A tall miner stared at him. “Why are you doing this, Captain? You could’ve left. You don’t even know us.”

Ako shrugged, checking the engine readings. “I know enough.”

“What’s enough?”

“That you’re human.”

He looked up, eyes hard. “And we don’t leave our own behind.”

The miner nodded slowly. “You’re mad.”

“Yup,” Ako said. “Keeps me alive.”


The Zhenar had noticed him by now. They called him The Black Ghost—a half-dead freighter that appeared from nowhere, stole civilians, and vanished back into debris fields. Ako took it as a compliment.

His final run came when the station’s power core went critical. The AI broadcast a single, desperate message: Evacuation priority sector nine. Hundreds of people were trapped behind collapsed bulkheads.

Ako throttled the Beast toward the sector, every warning light on his dash flashing. The radiation was cooking his hull, the gravity fields were unstable, but he didn’t stop. He couldn’t.

He threaded the ship through gaps that barely existed, brushing bulkheads, skimming through collapsing corridors. His hands danced over the controls—roll left, throttle down, burst right, vent plasma to fake a hit signature.

He drove the ship like he was back on Earth’s old roads—drifting through wreckage, hugging corners, making physics itself flinch.

When he reached the survivors, the sector was tearing itself apart. Ako flipped the Beast upside-down, parked her like a roof, and opened the lower ramp.

> “Get in!” he roared over the comm. “This is your last ride!”



They came—dozens, then hundreds, packed shoulder to shoulder. The ship’s life support screamed. The hull groaned. Ako’s instruments told him what he already knew: the Beast couldn’t take another hit.

So he gave her one last order.

“Come on, girl. One more run.”

He hit the main thrusters. The old freighter lunged out of the crumbling station, engines trailing plasma fire. A Zhenar cruiser moved to intercept, its cannons glowing. Ako twisted the controls in a pattern no sane pilot would ever attempt—a rolling inversion mixed with a lateral drift. The Beast skimmed along the cruiser’s belly, too close for the guns to track, and then shot through the explosion of a collapsing reactor conduit.

The shockwave flung them clear. The Beast tumbled end over end, its hull plates sloughing off like scales. Ako fought the controls until the stars steadied.

Behind him, the station disintegrated in silence.


Hours later, the Compact rescue fleet arrived. They found the Beast adrift, running on emergency power, her hull half-melted. Inside were 276 civilians, alive.

Ako was sitting on the floor of the cargo bay, leaning against a crate, eyes closed. He looked up when the boarding party entered.

“About time,” he said hoarsely. “She needs a tune-up.”

A Compact officer, tall and scaled, surveyed the wreck. “You flew this thing into the combat zone repeatedly? Alone?”

Ako nodded. “It’s what I had.”

The officer’s frills shifted in disbelief. “Why? You could have waited for the fleet.”

Ako shrugged. “Fleet wasn’t here.”

The officer stared at him, then at the ship. “You humans are... unpredictable.”

Ako smiled tiredly. “We prefer ‘stubborn.

They towed the Beast to a shipyard orbiting New Eridu, where engineers studied her like a relic. Her hull was more weld than original metal, her control systems cobbled together from three species’ tech, her drives running on sheer defiance. She should have fallen apart ten times over—but she hadn’t.

Compact engineers couldn’t understand it. Human pilots just nodded. “Because she believed in him,” they said.

Ako refused to have her scrapped. He welded a plaque onto her cracked hull himself, the letters crooked but proud:

> THE BEAST — SHE GOT US HOME.

Years later, when the Compact’s elite flight academies taught evasive combat maneuvers, they included a module called “Defensive Driving: The Rahman Pattern.”
And in the outer colonies, the story of Ako Rahman spread like wildfire—the man who didn’t wait for orders, who flew into fire with nothing but an old ship and an unkillable will.

They said that somewhere, out beyond the charted stars, the Beast still flew. Her engines sang like thunder. Her pilot laughed at the dark. And when someone asked what it meant to be human, the veterans of Erbil-9 would smile and say:

> “It means when the sky falls, there’s always an Ako with an armored ship saying, ‘Get in.’”

I’m planning a year-long personal project and could really use some feedback from this community.

Concept:
I work remotely, and my company runs a yearly “Work From Anywhere” contest — usually people just send a photo.
Next year, I want to take it up a notch and make a 1-minute cinematic video showing me working from different places throughout the year.

The idea is:
	•	Me + my laptop are constant (same framing, same movement sequence).
	•	The background changes every time — cafés, rooftops, beaches, my backyard, airport lounges, etc.
	•	I’ll stitch together these short clips into one cohesive 1-minute film that captures the “anywhere” spirit.

My plan:
Each location, I’ll shoot one long clip (around 1 min) of me doing the same motion:

walking in → sitting → opening laptop → typing → grabing and drinking coffee → closing laptop → standing up.
Then I’ll edit quick match cuts between different places.

Ask:
I’d love any tips on:
	•	Maintaining visual consistency across different environments
	•	Best camera angles/lenses for a balance of portrait + environment
	•	Lighting strategies when shooting in mixed conditions (indoor café vs bright outdoor)
	•	Any transition or editing tricks that could make the background changes feel smooth but not gimmicky

I’ll be shooting solo (with a tripod) using a mirrorless camera, so any solo cinematography hacks are super welcome too.

Thanks in advance — I’d love to hear what pros or hobbyists would recommend to make this visually cohesive and cinematic while still feeling real and personal. 🙏🏼",0,1762270617.0,cinematography,0,0.5,False

I come (gross) to you today with a question. A question hidden in the mind of an anxious man who likes to play no games.

I (M20) want to ask a girl (F19) out. A simple conundrum, yes, I understand. Just Do It (Nike, 1988).

Issues arise in the details. First off, I have not spoken with this girl in several years. We were sorta friends during high school, but we have not communicated during our Uni days. In addition to the communication gap, we both are a couple months fresh from 3-year relationships. So there’s a couple of barriers to hurdle in this.

At the crux of my post, however, is the fact that I’m not really interested in the “thrill” or “chase” that comes with the talking stage. So in order to skip that, I ask you all for advice on whether or not I’ll look crazy if I just send the following message, cold approach and all.

“Hey [[Insert My Lady Love’s Name Here]], this is totally out the blue and probably pretty odd, but I was wondering if you’d like to meet up for coffee or lunch sometime. You could even call it a date if that’s still what the kid’s are saying these days. No pressure at all btw, if you’re busy I totally get it, it’s not like I’ll be incredibly  disappointed and offended or anything!”

so the weekend prior, he was acting like normal, but maybe x10. he kept coming over to me to tell me stories, he went to walk away and came back to show me how he hurt himself the day prior, he was blushing when i made a flirty comment, he laughed at all my jokes, and he seemed genuinely happy to be near me. then when i went to leave both days, he followed me into the break room and started a convo with me while i clocked out (not normal at my job). on the second day, he didn’t really know what to say but he followed me in there anyway and he leaned back against the wall and just stood there. he looked like he was trying to act cool but it was a bit awkward, however i thought it was sweet. we told each other goodnight and i left that day feeling good about our feelings possibly being mutual.

this past weekend i worked with him only on saturday. when he came in, he completely avoided me. he didn’t even come in the normal way instead he came in through the back. he didn’t come over to help, didn’t hover like normal, and wasn’t warm with me. for our very small shift together he just decided to make me feel invisible, yet he was talking normally with everyone else. when he finally did come over because he switches to my station when i leave, he came over to me, asked me a question and before i answered he started walking away which is unlike him. then when i was doing some of the restocking (i normally stay longer to make sure i get everything done for him to help him out, he’s said that other people don’t do this) he asked me why i didn’t throw out the old iced coffee yet, but said it with condescending undertones like “hey why do you leave the old iced coffee out when you bring out the new one? i’ve noticed you always do this, why not just dump it out? why are you always doing this?” so i responded back “i don’t do it on purpose” (because i don’t, it just gets super busy and there’s a lot to do). then he said “it’s not necessarily a complaint, but just why?” the why felt very obvious to me and it just felt rude that after weeks of sweetness he was being super critical of me when he could’ve just asked me to do it. i don’t have an issue with constructive criticism, but i don’t like be belittled like that. so i stayed silent, got up, clocked out and left. i normally always stay to set up for him even though it’s not required of me, and i was already told i could go so i did. i walked right out without saying goodbye to him either. i just want to understand why he would switch up on me like this?",1,1762270330.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

So, a couple months ago I got gifted a cheap espresso machine. Great, got into trying different coffees, started ordering from specialty roasters, and I've been happy so far.

More recently, I've started learning about how to make an actual espresso, and realized I could be making so much better coffee. I had to ditch my portafilter with its pressurized basket, and so I needed to ditch my blade grinder and get a decent one.

So I went all out, got myself a K6, an scale with timer, decent basket, WDT, tamper... The order more than doubled the price of the machine, and it got here in different installments. As in, everything has been used, except for my portafilter, which arrived just now.

I was excited to make my first proper cup of coffee and it turns out, the portafilter doesn't fit in my machine. I took some pictures which I'll link below. The size is mostly right, but it's JUST big enough that it won't fit into the machine.

The machine brand is GRUNKEL (I assume it's eurotrash from Spain, my country), specifically marketed as GRUNKEL CAFPRESSO-20AROMA. Here's the website of the model: https://grunkel.com/cafetera-espresso-cafpresso-20aroma-20-bares-850w-negro/?srsltid=AfmBOoo4P-npuxGqJDkiIeXalBt1JwYG5-yHTO3yA1xjnr8gS8Od0olQ

And here's the link with the pictures: https://imgur.com/a/X4V4zvq

Does anybody know what can I do? If there's a different kind of portafilter I should look into, or anything specific. I thought I had though of everythink, measured everything a million times so I wouldn't waste any money and I'm still stuck with my pressurized basket T_T

For the past few months, I’ve been working on something that started out as a “small side project” and somehow turned into an entire platform 😅

I’ve always been into health, fitness, and tech — but every time I tried AI meal or workout apps, they just felt… off. Too generic. No real personality. So I decided to build my own.

That’s how **GreenLean** happened.

It’s a web app that uses AI to create personalized meal plans and workouts for users, based on their goals, lifestyle, and health data.  
But I didn’t stop there — I added gamified challenges, streaks, hydration tracking, progress analytics… basically, everything I wished other apps had.

I built it with **React**, **FastAPI**, and **Supabase** — and honestly, there were days where I thought about throwing my laptop out the window 😂  
Between debugging RLS at 3AM and watching API calls randomly fail, it tested my sanity more than any gym session ever could.

But now, it’s finally **live and working**, and seeing everything come together feels surreal.

Lists die on my phone. I open Notes, feel smart for 40 seconds, then remember the list again at 22 10. So in August I built a physical system that looks silly and works. I screwed an IKEA pegboard by the door and hung two aluminum bars on it, left bar is IN, right bar is OUT. On the left I clipped 7 plastic key tags on binder rings, each tag is one task for the day, handwritten with a fat marker so my eyes can’t pretend it’s optional. “Lunch packed”, “Laptop in bag”, “Med”, “Trash”, “Water bottle”, “Keys”, “Shoes on”. If a tag sits on the left, the thing is not real yet. When I do it, I move that tag to the right bar. I am not allowed to leave the apartment until every tag is on the right, and I physically touch each one before I grab the handle. Sounds childish, I know. It also stopped my 9 am chaos.



Weird rules made it stick: only one tag can be in my hand at a time, so I cant drift. If I get distracted, the tag in my hand tells me where to go back. At night the tags go back to the left bar in a tiny 30 second ritual, quick wipe with a baby wipe so the marker stays bold. Two tags hang lower, they are “wild cards” for the day, like pick up package or print train ticket. I color coded by friction. Red tags are things I forget even with a note, like meds, so they live at eye level. Blue tags are optional but good for me, like “Put banana in bag”, they sit low so I have to bend, that movement wakes me up more than coffee.



Bonus, I put a tiny mason jar of ground coffee next to the board. When I move the last tag to the right I unscrew it and take a big smell. My brain now associates that smell with the feeling of done, Pavlov but gentle. Partner joined in by adding one tag that says “text me when you leave” and it made us both calmer. We tried paper checklists, apps, timers. This is the first system that survives a Monday. If lists slide off your mind, try making them heavy enough to grab.

 I’m starting to wonder if it’s too much, too little, or just early-stage chaos. I eat tons of protein, sleep okay, and don’t drink coffee anymore.

Captain of the draconian trading ship ""Golden Claw"", third heir to the proud Drex dynasty. This is my Journal, which I intend to be a cronic of my life added to my family's historical library, as did my forefathers and their forefathers before them. Other than my brothers, fortune did not favour me to get a position as a planet-bound trader or as a servant of our royal court. Instead, I was chosen to be sent to the stars as a space merchant, recieving my Inheritance in the shape of my family's servitude-class trading cruiser ""Golden Claw"". On this day, I will set out with a crew of my trusted servants, my own trusted butler Ga'rix serving as my first officer and second in command, to proove to my family that I am worthy of my name.

I am Ra'con Drex, Captain of the draconian trading ship ""Golden Claw"". Since I have set out to the stars 6 standard-months ago from my homeworld, I managed to get a few semi-lucrative contracts done. I have not struck large riches yet, but I am able to cover the cost of operations of the Golden Claw completely with some money left at the end. My crew-lineup also changed a bit, since some of my servant's contracts expired and some new ones got hired on. Even some non-draconians! My new chief security officer, for example, is a Lopun female named Nari and the new ship's doctor of the Golden Claw is a Kolbold graduate of the galactic medical university called Scios who even brought on his entire team. Sensors and Communications will be handled by a Squidian male named La'resh, who already intrigues me since his eight appendages allow him to work both stations at once. I must admit that I am most curious about my new Chief Engineer, a ""Human"". Apparently, his species of death-worlders is rather new to the galactic stage, yet he already had excellent references. Through fellow traders and semi-official communications channels my family ties allow me access to, I made out a unique chance for a profitable haul from Thespia, a small, back-water planet on the fringes of civilised space. I have been warned against taking this particular haul due to a strong pirate presence in the area, but I trust that the galactic high guard keeps the main trade routes safe.

I am Ra'con, Captain of the draconian trading ship formerly known as the ""Golden Claw"", and I have lost all entitlement to that title. In fact, after disaster struck two weeks ago, I have lost all honour and all titles, including my proud family name. Although I should feel lucky that I am alive at all. Two days after we took on that goddes be damned shipment of Thespian raw diamonds, we were struck by pirates. Their first volley tore open a huge portion of the side of this vessel, killing almost the entire medical staff as well as decompressing part of the crew rest area, taking further lives. Our point defense lasers were laughably underpowered and the response from the high guard was slow, so the pirates had a time window to board us. During boarding, they felled more of my crew, including my security detail including my trusted Ga'rix, which left me especially devastated. When the high guard finally arrived, the pirates had long since left with the cargo, but not without surprisingly heavy losses. The bridge held, luckily, thanks to Nari and her team. I never thought a Lopun could fight that well. Engineering held, too. As some crewmembers tell me, that human now lying injured in what is left of sick bay fought like a draconian ragebeast before venting a reactor coolant line into one of the access corridors to fend off the borders. He went down, of course, but he inspired his team to keep fighting. Since Scios was among the first to die in the rapid decompression of sick bay, medical now lies in the hands of his young apprentice, a Kolbold female named Una. I usually would not trust a position that important to someone that young, but she managed to pull the deathworlder from death's grip and sent him on a path to full recovery, so she obviously is more than capable. Still, having lost my cargo that cost me a good part of my inheritance, and a lot of my crew to lowly pirates purely due to a miscalculation of mine leaves me dishonoured and in exile. All but a few of my original crew that were left, terminated their contracts, leaving me honourless and in exile with a skeleton crew on a broken ship without suficient funds to properly fix it. I guess the next few weeks will tell if the ""Broken Claw"" can pull through and if I have even a remote chance at regaining my honour.

I am Ra'con, Captain of the dishonoured draconian trading ship ""Broken Claw"", and I might just be able to pull this off. A week ago, I was at my lowest. My ship broken, my honour lost and no hope in sight. My Crew proved more resourceful than I had ever imagined. Almost none of those who stayed had any formal training in the draconian stellar navy, so they tend to find ""unconventional"" ways of fixing things that don't really go by the book. With some voluntaries and an engineering crew, Kolbold Una managed to bolster the medical crew and turn parts of the now empty crew quarters into an extended sickbay. The Lopun, Nari and La'resh the Squidian helped the human Scott run damage control and then improvised shock traps in the airlocks to prevent further boarding actions in the future. La'resh in particular was great at coordinating and resource management, which is why I will name him my new first officer tomorrow. Human Scott was especially surprising. Barely out of sick bay, he ran damage control for three days straight fueled by a strange, smelly, brown substance called ""coffee"". He got the engines up and running again almost immediately by salvageing some non-critical systems and we even have rudimentary shielding back online (I don't mind him salvageing the galley since we're only eating freeze-dried rations anyway since the kitchen staff quit, but I will miss the Jaccuzi...). He keeps fighting with Nari over which systems to prioritize though, that might become an Issue (La'resh had to break them up and mediate several times by now). This all speaks good fortune for me being able to reclaim my honour in the future. For now, we will try to bolster our meager funding with some save, low-value hauls in the galactic fringe though, since none of the galactic trade-guild would do buisness with a dishonoured draconian.

I am Ra'con, Captain of the dishonoured draconian trading ship ""Broken Claw"", and I am starting to be a little concerned about my mental health. Six weeks ago, after a pirate attack, I discovered that my crew had untapped potential in their own skills that could help me get back on track. I decided to ""let them loose"", so to say, while focussing on low-value, low-pay haul jobs outside of the trade guild. My Squidian first Officer, La'resh took over budgeting and allocated funds to Security (now headed by a Lopun named Nari), Engineering (still headed by a Human named Scott) and Medical/Crew welfare (now headed by our very own, newly graduated Kolbold Una, M.D.). Besides ""calling the shots"" on our jobs, as Human Scott phrases it for some reason, I handle job ackquisition. The system runs very well, exept for the semi-regular ""heated discussions"" between Nari and Scott. Until yesterday, that is. They seemed to have found a common ground on something and pooled a substantial portion of their meager funding for a common project they refused to disclose. Scott keeps calling it a set of ""surprise tools that will help us later"", which leads to Nari giggling incessively, which leaves me very concerned. I trust them, though, or at least I have to. What really worries me though, is that La'resh just shrugs when I ask him about. Can you imagine how weird it looks when a being with eight tentacles for limbs shrugs?

I am Ra'con, Captain of the dishonoured draconian ""trading"" ship ""Broken Claw"", and I am leading a crew of lunatics. I have clearly passed the point where I should have stopped them a long time ago, but since things are as they are I might as well keep going to find out what happens, honour be damned. In a feat of what is best described as ""security overkill meets engineered madness"", my chief of security, together with my chief engineer and my first officer of all people turned this trading ship of mine, a family heirloom and my only inheritance into what is best described as a ""cobbled together, slightly messed up and surprisingly well-armed kit-bash"" that would be classified as something around a corvette or cruiser if it was an actual design (godess beware that ever happens). Among others, they doubled both the number and the output of the point-defense lasers and wired them directly into the main sensor bank, they re-routed the entire shield grid through an improved emitter layout increasing shield strength by 20%, they added a direct line from the reactor emergency vent to the rear main thrusters (tied to a big, red button at the helm labeled ""free bird"" that for some reason also triggers a shipwide PA system playback of an old earth song - Scott argued that this was essentian for it to work for some reason) and they replaced the dorsal and ventral observation cupolas with Cyronian Level 6b plasma cannons somehow buffered by the frame shift-drive's capaciator banks. I do not care how they pulled that off, and I propably wouldn't even understand half of it, but if these things work, the ""Broken Claw"" could make a high guard patrol cruiser run for its money. They told me all this yesterday. Since then, my thaughts were limited to vatiations of ""What in the goddes name have I done?"", ""How did I get here?"" and ""Why me?"". Scott did fix the Jaccuzi though, so there is that. Also, I was contacted about being interested in hauling another shipment of thespian raw diamonds and I am at a point where I might give it a try, even if it's just to see what happens. I have long since abandoned the hope of ever restoring my honour in the eyes of my family.

I am Ra'con, and a lot of stuff happened. I did something unprecedented for someone in my standing, but seeing that I am everything but a formal draconian captain at that point, I did not care anymore. The crewmembers that stuck with me, who all worked together with me, are more important to me now than whatever entitled blood relatives ever were. They went through all this with me so they deserved to be part of that decision. I mentioned another shipment of thespian raw diamonds last time. Rather than make another decision at the cost of my ship and crew, I called for a ship-wide meeting in the mess hall. I offered the crew a vote on my captaincy and on the diamond job, expecting that they would demand me to abdicate for even considering another one of those jobs. They didn't. In fact, they were all positively longing for an opportunity to get back at these pirates. They unanimously voted in favour of both me as a captain and of taking on the diamond haul. There also was a poll to rename the ship again. So, I am proud to say: I am Ra'con, Captain of the free space trader ""Relentless Claw"" and her crew, who showed me the meaning of honour, family and community more than my relatives by blood ever did. We are going to have another try at that thespian raw diamond haul tomorrow. As Scott phrased it: ""Yeah! We ride at dawn, \[expletive redacted\]!""

I am Ra'con, captain of the free space trader ""Relentless Claw"", and that might have been a bit too much. Not only did I have to explain why three pirate frigates were found molten to slag near the route of our last haul, me and my crew even recieved the thespian cross of honour for it. Furthermore, me and the entire crew of the Relentless Claw now specialise in high-value transport and the funds from that diamond haul allowed us to upgrade the claw even further. Una was pleasantly pleased that we added ""high-risk disaster respose"" to our portfolio with the now upgraded medical facilities, Nari eagerly observed the installation of a full set of missile batteries where the port- and starboard EVA airlocks used to be, Scott is positively salivating over a factory-new set of main thrusters (which are actually rated at well over double the power of the original ones) and La'resh actually managed to hire new kitchen staff. That means, we no longer have to eat freeze-dried rations and Scott will finally shut up about ""getting some decent coffee once in a while"". My family even tried to contact me for restoring my honour in their standing as well as the galactic trade union, but I could not care less about that as things are now. As far as I am concerned, my home is the Relentless Claw and my Family is her crew. 

I am Ra'con, captain of the free space trader ""Relentless Claw"", and they are doing it again. They are driving me insane. La'resh went through the entire new mess staff menu (apparently he is quite the foodie, who would have guessed) and got food poisoning from an incompatibility with a human spice called ""Tabasco"". Una is currently with him in sick bay, trying to stop him from vomiting his innards out (do Squidians even have innards?) and Scott and Nari are off doing goddess knows what after they had a lengthy talk with Una yesterday (note to self: find out what a ""best man"" is supposed to do at a traditional human wedding and research similar Lopun bonding rituals). All in all, it is total chaos, insanity and a weird combination of ""home sweet home meets powder keg"".

1oo9su7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKrelationshipadvice/comments/1oo9su7/i_have_done_everything_right_on_paper_to_approach/,I have done everything right on paper to approach someone and yet still failed. What went wrong?,"A few months ago, I (23M) came across a really cute girl (20/21F) in the coffee shop that I go to everyday. I had no experience asking someone out before, I never had any relationships in my life, but I read advice on Internet to try to cover my lack of experience.

I know women generally don't like to be approached by strangers, not even in public space like Costa under bright daylight. I didn't even think of approaching the first two days. In fact, I only had enough courage to approach this girl because I had seen her for 3 consecutive days, and every day we had eye contacts and smiled at each other. I took those as signals that she wanted me to approach, so I did that on the third day.

I have heard that it's considered more confident and safer for women if you give them your number instead of asking for theirs. So what happened next was, I went up to her, asked if I could sit down (she said yes), chatted with her for 10 minutes or so, and then gave her a piece of paper with my number written down before I left. I said to her that I would like to go out with her, and if she's interested, she could send me a text.

So I left the ball in her court and didn't push for anything. The very same night, I was flabbergasted to receive a text for her. We texted via chat for a couple of days before I tried to set up a date. People said you need to have a plan instead of simply saying things like 'let me know if you want to ...'. A lot of people also mentioned that something casual like a coffee date during the day is usually the best, so the other party doesn't feel pressured, doesn't feel dangerous and doesn't need to spend loads of money. So I picked a date and time and asked if she'd be down to grab a coffee together in a nearby cute coffee shop (not Costa this time!).

She said she'd like to but was busy that weekend. I knew that's usually a soft rejection if she said she was busy but did not propose another date and time. So I didn't push further. We exchanged a couple more texts before I let go.

Two weeks later, she texted me and apologised for the lack of reply, then dropped a bomb out of nowhere, that she was helping her boyfriend (wtf?) with moving house the last two weeks and hence she was slow in replying, but ""I might see you again in the coffee shop"".

If a woman has a boyfriend already, I am going to respect the boundary and not going to pursue anymore or try to be her friends and hope one day they break up etc. So even though she said she'd be happy a friend, I clearly said to her (via text) that what I had always intended to do was taking her out on a date, not hanging out as a friend. After that, I stop messaging her.

That was how the first ever approach in my life unfolded. I think I have done everything right on paper, yet I still completely failed. Even my friend agreed that I did nothing wrong, and the fact that she decided to text me back after I gave her my number should indicate that she was interested in something romantic.

I don't understand it at all. What could I have done better? Obviously I was sad but I was more confused and discouraged if anything. Because if I have done things right and I still fail, what can I even do? 

I am very lonely deep down but I also always remind myself not to be disrespectful to others and not to look desperate. But if there's no hope, I don't know how long I could maintain a health mindset for. What can I do? What should I do?",3,1762269346.0,UKrelationshipadvice,6,1.0,False
1oo9qt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1oo9qt5/you_must_include_the_exact_sku_from_the_approved/,"“You must include the exact SKU from the approved catalog” ok boss, give me three weeks of downtime then","I run a tiny facilities team for a public theater. We fix seats, change bulbs, unjam doors, the unglam stuff that keeps shows on time. New procurement head arrives and sends a sunny email, from now on all purchases must use the approved catalog and include the exact SKU, no exceptions, tickets without SKUs will be closed. Before this, we just walked to the vendor 2 blocks away and bought screws and odd brackets on a store card, fast and cheap. I wrote back, hey, a lot of what we buy is weird one off hardware, the catalog doesnt have 5mm furniture t nuts or the antique hinge pins our balcony uses. He replied with a quote, “process creates freedom.”



So I complied. First week a seat arm fails in Row G before a matinee. Used to be a 10 minute jog to grab a 6 mm insert and a matching bolt. Now I open the catalog, search inserts. Only option is “generic wall anchor, assorted.” Policy says exact SKU. I create a request to add our part to the catalog like the handbook allows. The form wants dimensions, supplier, HS code, photo on white background. I take a picture on printer paper with my phone, upload, ticket goes to pending. I print “Seat G12 closed for maintenance” and go tell front of house, sorry. Audience sits around a little hole that looks like a bite mark.



By Thursday my queue is comedy. A door closer needs a tiny screw, but the catalog has a single line item, “door screw kit assorted 1 lb.” Not allowed, not exact. I submit a new item, “Machine screw M5 x 12 zinc pan head, bag of 25,” attach a glamour shot of a screw next to a quarter. Then a hinge wants a pin, then a seat wants a special washer, then my cart wants coffee because now everything is a photo shoot. Each request gets routed to Procurement Review which meets on Tuesdays. The backlog grows, our open tickets grow, and my radio becomes a museum of me saying “waiting on SKU approval” in different tones.



Week two procurement writes me, why are maintenance KPIs red. I send a tidy spreadsheet, 41 catalog additions pending, 0 approvals, policy quote highlighted. Also a note that the show on Saturday had 7 blocked seats because I can’t buy 2 dollars of hardware without a SKU. They escalate. Week three the executive director tries to sit in G12, finds the little “sorry” sign, and asks why his own theater looks like a toothless grin. I forward the same sunny email with “no exceptions” and a photo of my best screw still life.



Fallout, on Monday we got a new line in the catalog called “Field Urgent Non-Catalog” with a 150 dollar weekly limit and a requirement to upload a receipt after. I stapled that policy to the wall and walked to the vendor like a free man. We added back 23 seats in one afternoon with 9 dollars of parts. Procurement head now waves at me when I bring in receipts. I wave back with hands that smell like actual work, not printer paper.

1oo9p09,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1oo9p09/are_my_expectations_too_high/,Are my expectations too high?,"My husband (male 29) and I (female 28) have been married for 7 years. Sharing of responsibilities has always been a point of contention for us. He has ADHD and struggles with time management and keeping track of tasks that need to be done. 
In the past I have been able to help accommodate this by making him lists, setting reminders, and pick up on slack or things he has forgotten about. In the past year though this has become increasingly more difficult due to our 3 year old daughter having a lot more commitments to be on the ball about and also a new puppy in the house.

We take turns with mornings on who gets up first. The morning person gets up at 430 and is in charge of making breakfast, making coffee, packing lunches, taking dogs for walk, and getting daughters stuff packed for the day. Daughter wakes up at 630, so that gives morning person 2 hours to complete tasks. We have had multiple conversations about the expectations along with a list on the fridge. When it is my husband’s turn, he consistently does not set an alarm so I have to wake him up, and he will only complete 2/5 of the tasks ( usually only breakfast and coffee). This leaves me to scramble to complete the rest of the tasks when I wake up. When it is my turn everything is done and he gets to sleep in until 630 without any worries.

When I try to broach the subject with him about figuring out a better system (like making lunch the night before or setting timers for himself) he gets upset and tells me that I don’t think anything he did is good enough, or my expectations are too high.

Are they? I mean I feel like it’s fair and it’s also everything that NEEDS to get done in the morning. I have zero issues completing all the tasks and it’s frustrating that I even have to manage him. 

Any advice? Or am I being unfair?


P.S There’s not an even split of responsibilities at all. I am the primary parent for our daughter and do a majority of cleaning, cooking, budgeting, and keep track of extracurricular (school programs, sports, birthdays, etc.)",5,1762269109.0,TwoHotTakes,11,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So, basically what the title says. Everything is so hard all of the time. Well, not everything. I do really well at work, I'm able to meet deadlines, get my orders in, manage Stuff™, etc. Sure, my desk gets messy sometimes but my job performance is really good.

My home though...? I struggle to do laundry, struggle to do dishes, struggle to cook, struggle to maintain an exercise routine, struggle to keep ANYTHING clean (living room, bathroom, bedroom especially), struggle to pay bills on time, struggle managing my finances ... everything to do with being an adult us so hard. Sometimes I do well, but right now it feels monumentally hard to do anything. I feel like I am drowning 🙃

Does anyone have aby advice for me?? I know eating healthy (especially high protein) and exercise help but actually doing those is HARD.

Ali says the girls knew they were dating and she has to go back before they wake up. Han says it isn't her jacket. Spence assumes it's the older boy she talked about. Only Spence knew that.

The loan Ashley wanted is declined. Mrs Potter came just like any other year for her safe deposit box. She said she's the last Potter. Noel goes to Aria to ask her what they wanted her. So annoying. A book fell from her locker and A told her to read page 22. It's a poem by Ezra. I thought writing a book didn't go well. Is he thinking about publishing poetry?

Potter takes the candies but leaves her key. Priorities. Ashley wanted to give it to her back decides to help herself instead.

A girl asks Hanna for her liposuction doctor. She says she doesn't have one and people talk about her in the hallway. Mona got a text from A saying the reason she got skinny cause she got liposuction. Mona uninvited her to her party and now is besties with Naomi and Riley and they leave. So A now defames Han. Hanna says she will go to the party.

Aria is stuck on the Ezra's poetry he wrote. I love that poem so much. She goes and argues with Ezra. She asks how could he feel these stuff and reacting like that to her. She said she moved on. Them why did you came? Noel comes and asks what's happening. Aria says nothing so it's answer to both. Too emphasized. Now Noel stands there. Ezra asking if there's something you'd like to say 😂 I mean why stand there?! Give the look so the other feel threatened? He leaves and Ezra is frustrated that much that throws the book across the room. I mean like he really is looking calm outside but boiling on the inside.

Hastings house, Ian knocks and wants to go for coffee with Melissa. The liars come and Melissa say it's cute that they will go camping. But it's clamping! Spence says to give Ian a chance and that she wants to stop fighting. They go for coffee. How easily Melissa change her mind? Spencer did it cause she feels guilty about Wren and Ian. She tells the liars. After they broke up they dated each other. What? The adult that dated the sister and the teen?! What?!

Tv says that Toby is wanted for the murder cause the sweater had a bloodstain of Ali. Toby got he's sweater back after Ali wore it? Aria can't believe he is the older boy. True! Like just because of the sweater? If I would kill her I would destroy the sweater! Who would have kept it?!

Em's room. Em can't believe he judged Toby wrong. Maya said that Toby she knew wasn't the Toby that killed Ali. True! Somebody called Em's phone wasn't talking and she got scared. Like obviously! But her dad came up. Family reunion! “I didn't know you had company” Didn't Em told before that she knows you were together? Pam telling Maya to leave cause they want family time… like you could ask differently.

Aria out with Ella for dinner. She said Ali convinced them she hated Toby. So now she believes it as well. These people believe everything they hear? Ella is so right about wishing she would tell her but doesn't blame her. Like that's a good parent move!

Dad talks to Em about Toby. So everyone believe this! What he went through one time now again!  While Ben the perfect boyfriend is getting me sick! “Honor to being truthful” And Em answers that we maybe aren't ready for the truth. Pam was listening them and she received the kiss photo probably from A. So A revealed once again a liar's secret to her mom.

Melissa says she had a good time with Ian and they basically reconciled to not hate each other anymore. Melissa thinks Ali's games got her killed and that's actually a good idea.

Em with her car in the woods, Toby appears from the backseat. Like how that happened?! He just went in her car? She gets scared and he wants to finish what he started. The homecoming talk. He said on September 1st he ended the relationship with Jenna and that Jenna was in love with him. Told you people could have different meaning on a date!

Mona is receiving gifts at her camp. Aria and Spence arrive and shows them around. I really like the pink tulle!
Toby wanted to talk to Ali to tell her she was doing him a favor. The met outside of Spence's barn and he gave her he's sweater cause it was cold. Awww!! Such a gentleman!! And then left with a guy. A lot can happen in a day you know! Or night on that occasion.

Em thinks he should talk to the police. Yeah, I wonder how that will work out. He spent a year in reform school, he got friends in all wrong places. I actually think it's awesome cause you can leave! “Misery wants company” Reminds me of Spence's in the first episode that hope breeds eternal misery. He left his stuff behind the church. Oh no…

So she wents to tell the girls like please!! Han is getting ready for stakeout. A sends Aria to go where they found Ali's bracelet. How can Spence know that distance?! Mona tells them they need to go glamp so Spence will go for the bracelet.

Ezra sends Aria that he needs to see her. She says to Em it's her mom. Ella and Ezra have only 2 different letters so you know, she could mix them up.

Hanna is on the woods. Em and Aria did perm or something. Spence found a bracelet like theirs but written Jenna on it and a note that said they are at the dark like Jenna searching for her in wrong places. You know A could tell them exactly where A would go so they don't have to look in wrong places but choses not too😂

Ashley drives, Byron would appreciate a ride but she says she doesn't go home. I believe she does though but she stole Potter's money. Or like borrowed.
Poor Toby waits for his ride or Em but police shows up and they catch him.

Spencer sits by the bonfire and things what A wrote them. She thinks of something and search for Aria but she goes with Em cause they need to go to the right place Wright's playground. My little genius did it again.

Hanna is at stakeout and sees a car coming, the girls go to search as well. And it's Ezra that Aria went to meet him. A does these stuff and knows everything?

He says he was a coward. He was searching for another job. Aria is right he shouldn't just decide on his own. He asks to forgive him and now they kiss. Oh my darlings!! So as this happens he decides to close the lights and Hanna sees them and is shocked. Second time she learns first one of the other's secret. If we look at it in that way, if you wanted privacy you should keep them turned on.

Spence and Em find a tree with a heart that says Alison loves Ian. When you find something important, you photograph it. So was Ali uposet for the kiss because she liked Ian as well? Or was she dating him at the time?

Hanna calls Aria, who doesn't hear it, cause she saw a person that wrote “I see you” to the back of Ezra's car.
Han sends she knows who A is and will go to the parking lot, the others go there and a car comes out of nowhere and hits her. A sent that she knew too much. That she knows who A is I guess? To the clip “I know you want to kiss me” it's Ian.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

1oo98ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialOpinions/comments/1oo98ng/the_way_we_talk_about_drugs_and_homelessness_in/,The way we talk about drugs and homelessness in America is fundamentally broken.,"I grew up in a small town but have spent the past few years living in big cities, including three years in Los Angeles. Homelessness and drugs are an extreme problem, obviously in LA but nowadays it's really everywhere. The fact that the economy has sucked for years now and that rent is unaffordable nationwide is a major factor, but I wanted to talk about our understanding of the problem. 
Over the years when I ask people about it a lot of them say "" They choose to live that way, they like it really "" or "" They chose to do drugs, if that is what they want then they deserve the consequences "" firstly, 99% of homeless people do not choose to live that way. Many end up on the streets because of bankruptcy, legal battles, disability or mental illness, I know because I have spoken with many of them. When they do end up on the streets it is basically impossible to get back on their feet without help. Second, I won't deny that drug and alcohol addiction is common among the poor, but addiction isn't a choice, it is an illness. When you are addicted your body becomes physically dependent on that substance. If a hardcore heroine user decides to quit cold turkey, the withdrawals could LITERALLY kill them. Think about your addictions. What if you tried to quit coffee or video games right now? A lot of people couldn't even do that, but they expect hardcore drug addicts to be able to quit at any time. Getting off drugs should be treated more like therapy than a moral choice. Some say ""well they shouldn't have started in the first place"" maybe so, it is certainly a big mistake to make. But people should be allowed forgiveness. Think about the biggest mistake you ever made; what if all of society condemned you to a live a life of misery for a single mistake? 
The way people talk about the poor in LA is evil. They talk about them like they are rats, roaches, pests. I used to work at a cafe where people would freak out every time a homeless person walked it. Even if he was minding his business people looked afraid, or disgusted. Usually someone would try to kick him out or call the cops, sometimes within seconds of him walking in. The lack of empathy and the way people have to justify their struggle to keep themselves comfortable is truly saddening. Even otherwise good people I knew still struggled to see them as fully human, or came up with cheap excuses to not care. There are effective ways to combat homelessness and drug use, but until we see our neighbors as people in need of help rather than pests to be rid of, until we start tackling this as a systemic issue with causes and solutions rather than a subject of personal morality, I fear we will be stuck in this situation.",1,1762268049.0,ControversialOpinions,0,1.0,False

I’m fairly new to Kdramas, and I can tell when they’re doing product placement but it mostly doesn’t feel as ridiculous as this. 

So the Drama is The Tale Of The Nine Tailed and the FL is sitting her friends down to tell them everything that’s going on and they’re in danger. But instead of it being a serious moment, the FL offers to make them coffee. She makes 2 instant Kanucoffees for her friends. One of the friends does “ooh it feels like I’m in a fancy cafe!” And the other does “I just wish life could be as smooth as this coffee!”  I actually had to pause to laugh 😂

1oo97sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1oo97sb/legacy_of_truth/,Legacy of Truth,"The day had begun like any other, heavy with a silence that only grief can bring. Ava Thomas walked slowly up the driveway to her father’s house, the crisp autumn air cutting through her jacket. Leaves crunched beneath her boots, a harsh reminder that life moves forward even when you feel frozen in place. The funeral was scheduled for the morning, and she had expected to coordinate with her sister Lena, to plan the service together, to honor their father properly. But when she arrived, the front door was open, and the first thing she saw was Roland Thomas — their uncle — standing in the living room, papers in hand, a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

 “Girls,” he said, voice smooth, almost rehearsed. “I took care of everything. No need to worry.”

 Ava’s stomach dropped. “What do you mean, everything? The funeral… the arrangements?” Her voice wavered, disbelief giving way to anger.

 Roland spread the papers on the coffee table like a magician revealing a trick. “Yes. I’ve handled the services, the permits, and the funds. You know, it’s better this way. Less stress for you both.”

 Lena arrived moments later, her face pale, eyes wide as she saw the spread of documents. “Roland… what’s going on?” she demanded, stepping forward.

 Roland waved a hand dismissively. “It’s all in order. Your father trusted me to manage it, and I did. Really, you should be grateful.”

 Grief and confusion collided in Ava’s chest. “Grateful? You didn’t even tell us! We should have been involved. This is Dad’s funeral, not your personal show.”

 Roland’s smile faltered, a flicker of irritation crossing his features. “I know what’s best. Trust me. It’ll be fine.”

 But Ava could see through the polished exterior. Something about the way he avoided her gaze, the careful control over the documents, the rushed instructions… it felt wrong. She moved closer to the coffee table, scanning the papers. Bank statements, invoices, and forms lay neatly arranged, all approved in handwriting that looked suspiciously familiar.

 Her fingers trembled as she noticed a recurring signature — one that was hers, but written in a shaky imitation. Her heart pounded. “These… these are forged,” she whispered.

 Lena leaned over, her eyes scanning the pages. “Roland… what have you done?”

 For a brief second, the room was silent except for the ticking of the old clock on the wall. Then Roland’s tone hardened. “I’ve done what needed to be done. Now, please, stop worrying and let the arrangements proceed.”

 Ava felt a surge of defiance. Grief turned into anger, and anger into resolve. “No. This isn’t over. Dad trusted us, not you. And whatever you’ve done with the funds or the paperwork, we will find out. I promise you that.”

 Roland’s expression remained unreadable, but Ava sensed the first crack in his carefully constructed facade. She knew then that the battle for her father’s honor had begun, and nothing — not his wealth, not his influence, not even fear — would stop them from uncovering the truth.

 The wind rattled the windows, a low moan that seemed to echo Ava’s determination. Tomorrow would bring more than a funeral. It would mark the beginning of justice.",1,1762267990.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

Folks get together every week, each eith a project to work on (drawing, crocheting, painting, coding, etc), then have the opportunity to meet other like-minded folks while chipping away!

I'd ideally like to find a place that's open til 8 pm on at least one week night, isn't too crowded, has some table space, & has a staff that's open to 10 to 20 of us every week. Any thoughts? I'd love to check out some potential options this week.

In DC, we usually meet at a makerspace in a library that stays open til 9 pm, but have also met at coffee shops, parks, restaurants, & a community garden. Our meetup in Denver meets exclusively at a cool coffee shop that co-hosts the events with us.

1oo95ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/1oo95ck/my_brother_thinks_he_doesnt_need_rehab/,My brother thinks he doesn’t need rehab,"About 4 weeks ago my brother was in an accident that left him with a Grade 3 DAI. His recovery so far has been incredible, especially considering that on day 7 we were essentially given a death sentence letter. He spent 10 days in an induced coma and has now been in the neurology ward for about 16 days.

He’s just been approved for rehab, but he thinks he’s fine and doesn’t believe he needs it. Over the past few days, he’s made a lot of progress, he can walk fairly well, he made coffee, and even remembers what he did that day. Also his speech is now pretty clear and he doesn’t babble. But he still repeats himself multiple times throughout the day, mixes up stories, and can’t always tell what was real and what was a hallucination. When he walks, he sometimes bumps into things that are in his way.

I’m really struggling with how to tell him that he needs rehab and that he’ll likely be there for a while. He seems to think it’ll only be a few days. I’m also not sure if he’d even remember the conversation the next day. 

He was supposed to start an engineering internship on the 24th and is convinced he’ll be out of hospital in time to do it. On the slim chance that he is discharged by then, I’m worried it wouldn’t be wise for him to move to another state, live alone in a new apartment, and work full-time. I’m trying to gently help him understand that he won’t be back to 100% yet and that while the internship is a great learning opportunity, it’s okay to wait so he doesn’t push himself too soon. The company through my cousin has already said they’d be happy for him to start at the same time next year. 

The problem is, he either gets upset about still being in hospital or angry. He complains every hour he wants to go home. His rehab was already delayed because they were worried he might walk out. I’m just not sure how to address this conversation without upsetting him. Cause for now I just say “wait for what the doctors say”. So any advice would be appreciated.

In addition to examining major economic and political transformations and upheavals, we will consider the changing relationship between humans and the natural world, as well as the extraction, production, and global movement of commodities such as silk, ceramics, coffee, rice, sugar, chocolate, tobacco, cotton, and. Students will learn about the emergence of plantation slavery, the industrial revolution, capitalism, decolonization, nationalism, and communism. Rather than framing the period since 1500 as the “rise of the West” this course takes a de-centered approach, illustrating the multitude of human experiences, cultural and religious practices, technologies, and arts from across Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

My husband was 42. I'm 29. We'd been married for four years. His best friend was 35, better looking, made more money, and had been flirting with me for the past year. The attention felt good. My husband worked all the time. He forgot my birthday twice. He'd pat my shoulder like I was his coworker instead of his wife.

So when his best friend showed up at the hospital that first night and held my hand in the waiting room, I let him. When he whispered that my husband never deserved me, I didn't pull away. When he kissed me in the parking garage at 2am, I kissed him back.

My husband had a severe head injury. The doctors said he might not wake up. Might never be the same person if he did. I stood there looking at him hooked up to all those machines and I felt nothing. Just this cold calculation running through my head about what came next.

His best friend drove me home that night. We had sex in my bed. Our bed. I took off my wedding ring and left it on the nightstand.

""You deserve so much better than this,"" he said afterwards. ""You deserve someone who actually sees you.""

I believed him. God, I really believed him.

Two weeks later my husband was still in the coma. His best friend had basically moved in by then. His clothes in the closet. His coffee mug in the kitchen. His car in the driveway where my husband's used to be before it got totaled.

My mother in law called me every day asking if I needed anything. I'd put on my sad wife voice and tell her I was managing. She had no idea her son's best friend was in the shower behind me.

""You're being so strong through this,"" she'd say.

I felt powerful. Like I'd finally taken control of my life. My husband's insurance and savings meant I didn't have to work. His best friend was attentive and exciting. We'd go out to nice restaurants while my husband lay there unconscious. I'd post sad updates on social media about hoping for a miracle, then come home and fuck his best friend on the couch.

Three months in, my husband woke up. The hospital called me at 6am. I was tangled up with his best friend in bed and I actually felt annoyed by the interruption.

""He's asking for you,"" the nurse said.

I looked at his best friend. He kissed my forehead.

""Go be the devoted wife for a bit,"" he said. ""We'll figure this out.""

I went to the hospital. My husband could barely speak but he grabbed my hand when he saw me. His eyes filled with tears. The doctors said he'd need months of rehab. Possible permanent damage. He might never work again.

I drove home and told his best friend everything. We sat at the kitchen table and mapped it out like a business plan. I'd wait a few months until my husband was stable. Then file for divorce. His best friend would support me through it. We'd be together properly once the dust settled.

""I love you,"" his best friend said that night. ""I should have fought for you years ago.""

Four months after my husband woke up, he came home. He was in a wheelchair. Could barely feed himself. His mother had arranged for a home health aide to come daily. I played the caring wife role. Helped him into bed. Brought him water. Looked sad and tired when his family visited.

His best friend stayed away during those weeks. We'd text constantly. Make plans for our future. He'd send me apartment listings for us to move into together once I left.

""Soon,"" I kept telling him. ""I just need to time this right.""

Then my husband started getting better faster than expected. Started noticing things. Like how I never really looked at him anymore. How I was always on my phone. How his best friend hadn't visited once since he came home.

""Where is he?"" my husband asked one night. ""Why hasn't he come by?""

""He's been busy with work,"" I said. ""You know how it is.""

My husband stared at me for a long moment. Something in his eyes changed.

Two weeks later I filed for divorce. Moved out while my husband was at a rehab appointment. His best friend helped me pack. We took my stuff to his apartment across town. I felt free. Finally free.

""We can stop hiding now,"" I told him that first night in his place.

He seemed distant. Said he needed time to process everything. That it was a big change. I figured he just needed to adjust.

But then he started pulling away. Coming home late. Being on his phone constantly. When I asked what was wrong he'd say nothing. That he loved me. That everything was fine.

I pushed for us to make it official. To tell people we were together. He kept saying it was too soon. That we needed to be respectful of my husband's situation.

""He's your ex-husband now,"" I said. ""Why do we have to hide?""

""It's complicated,"" he said. ""People will judge.""

Last week I woke up and he was gone. Like completely gone. His clothes cleared out. His toothbrush missing. There was a box on the bed with a note that just said ""You should see this.""

Inside was a flash drive.

I plugged it into my laptop. It was security camera footage. From my house. Our house. My husband's house. Cameras I didn't know existed.

Footage of me and his best friend. In the bedroom. In the kitchen. On the couch. The timestamps started three days after the accident. There were dozens of files. Months of footage.

There was also a folder of screenshots. Text messages between me and his best friend. Planning. Scheming. Laughing about my husband. Talking about his insurance money. About waiting for the right time.

And a legal document. From my husband's lawyer. Showing that all of this footage had been submitted to the court. That my divorce filing was being contested. That I was getting nothing in the settlement due to adultery and fraud. That my husband had been aware of the affair for months but let me keep digging my own grave.

The worst part was the final file. A video message from his best friend.

""I needed evidence,"" he said into the camera. ""Your husband suspected something was off but needed proof. I'm sorry it had to be this way but he's my actual best friend. Was. Before you. He asked me to get close to you. To see if you'd really betray him while he was fighting for his life. And you did. You really did.""

His face looked genuinely sad in the video.

""I did care about you at first,"" he continued. ""But watching you laugh about him while he was relearning how to walk made me sick. The things you said about him. About his money. About waiting for him to be more dependent so you could take more in the divorce. I recorded all of it. Every word.""

The video ended.

I've been calling him for six days straight. His number is disconnected. He doesn't work at the company he said he worked at. I don't even know if that was his real apartment or just a place he rented to complete this whole setup.

My husband won't speak to me. His lawyer sent a cease and desist. His family has blocked me on everything. The few friends I had won't return my calls. Everyone's seen the footage somehow. It's like I don't exist anymore.

I can't afford my own lawyer. Can't afford rent. I'm staying on my sister's couch and she won't even look at me. She just leaves food outside the door and goes to work.

I keep thinking about my husband in that hospital bed. How his hand shook when he reached for mine. How he cried when he saw me. How he said my name like I was the only thing keeping him alive.

I threw that away for someone who never existed.

So, am I the asshole?

1oo93v7,https://i.redd.it/gwkaph2r69zf1.png,I started making a chatbot without knowing anything about Telegram bots or AI. Now it gives me a better experience than similar products on the market.,"I'm still a little shocked and don't really know where to go from here. You see, I hate doing pet projects. I hate coming home after a day of working with code and choosing between continuing to work for a few more hours with a stack that already makes me sick, or learning a completely new technology, slowly working my way through it until I can write something slightly better than “Hello World.”

But a couple of months ago, I tried AI agents for development. And it was... wow. 

Half an hour of thinking through the architecture and I already have a prototype in my hands. Having barely delved into the new technology, I can already put it to work and add a feature. I can learn something new and use my project as a testing ground. 

The result was this chatbot. I probably thought it would be fun, considering that AI was what brought back my love for programming. 

Anyway, she's funny, likes to ask useless questions, never forgets anything, and runs on the latest version of DeepSeek. Her name is Roxy.

She already:

\- Has vector memory, thanks to which it remembers all correspondence, no matter how long it is.

\- Greets you in the morning and wishes you good night.

\- Can receive several messages in a row. Just like a normal person, yeah.

\- Has unobtrusive monetization with absolutely no auto-renewals. I hate those as much as pet projects.

Next, I will add:

\- Personality settings with ready-made presets;

\- NSFW mode switch;

\- Sticker image recognition (you can send Roxy memes, lol)

\- Sending images to the user

\- Internet search if necessary

\- And lots of other stuff 

In short, I want to create a chatbot that feels as natural to talk to as your friend.",1,1762267745.0,SideProject,1,1.0,False

Surgery was yesterday at 12:30 PM, removed all 3 columns, and administered Exparal and Marcaine. 
After I woke up, I felt fine and zero pain. Peed without any issues. Left the hospital. Took tylenol and advil in the evening. As well as gas ex and stool softener.

First night after surgery: despite feeling fine, I had random burning sensations and twinges. Pressure like I had to poop. Finally got up at 3 am to sit on the sitz bath and had alot of gas come out. More pain and some very mild spasms. Pain was at a 1-2. 

Morning day 1 post-op- Woke up 6 am with pressure again to poop. Despite coffee with Miralax and eggs for breakfast, let out more gas but no BM. More mild pain and spasms, a little stronger than last night but still fine. Took my tylenol and Meloxicam. Took a sitz bath and applied nifedipine ointment. 

Right now at 9:45 am feeling better than I did this morning.

1oo8y0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1oo8y0e/are_the_tasting_notes_in_your_coffee_real/,Are the tasting notes in your coffee real?,"I am writing this post as I sip a liberica naturals from Rossette that has been carefully processed in a bio-reactor reaching the optimal pH, temperature and yeast combination. According to the coffee roaster it should taste like *berry iced tea*, *cotton candy* and *florals*.

How can coffee taste like cotton candy? Coffee tastes like coffee. Are the notes on my coffee even real? Do people make them up? Are we all supposed to taste the same notes?

# Well-brewed coffee has nuance

There’s a science behind brewing coffee. To get the optimal taste, you need fresh beans that are ground just before brewing, a good setup and a well executed recipe.

# All coffee tastes like coffee but two coffees can still differ in taste

Brew two different coffees at the same time. Both will majorly taste the same but not exactly the same. There is nuance in them.

For me tasting notes is the way to *describe that nuance*, that difference. The coffee that I am sipping at the moment doesn’t taste like berry flavoured ice tea but it is definitely different from other coffees. A way to describe that minor difference in words is to say it is like berry flavoured ice tea. The coffee leaves my mouth with a sweet and fluffy feeling as if I have just had cotton candy.

# Everyone can have their own tasting notes

As I sip the coffee more, I want to describe that nuance as sweet syrup and oolong tea. I can and I won’t be wrong. These words are describing a feeling and there is no one correct word.

# Tasting notes are overrated

It is a subjective language. You may taste something else. You may not find any words to describe what you taste. It’s all okay. Enjoying the taste is more important than describing the taste.

***tldr:*** The tasting notes are real but they don’t describe the taste. They describe the difference between two coffees, the feeling and the nuance. They help drinkers communicate.

    I originally wrote this for my Substack. Hence, the long format. It should be interesting for people here too.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

He keeps on making jokes, touching me on my shoulders or trying to tickle me. I told him time and time again to leave me alone but he wouldn't listen and told me it's just a joke.  
I am in a job and office where most of my peers and superiors are men, i'm one of the two ladies at work.  
I am the last hire (been here for almost 2 years atm) and at the beginning I didn't say anything because i didn't wanna come out as whiny or someone that complains a lot. It was also something that didn't happen that much.  
I wanna also add that I worked for years, in differente jobs and different countries so this is not my first rodeo.  
What I think happened was that all these little touches and other things (he told me he wanted to see me in a nice dress, he wanted to go out to have a nice dinner with me. I said no both times) led me to answer back to him in a really hurtful way (i dont know how else to explain it) and overtime, even though i was trying to ignore it, i started answering back to other colleagues in the same way i do to him. It's becoming ""second nature"". What i think is happening is: i am trying to protect myself by attacking first.  
In the last 3 weeks the situation escalated and one of the managers called me over to discuss what was going on because I was ""unsufferable to be around"". I told him the recent installment with this guy: he was sitting in front of me and staring at me, when i told him to stop it he said he was enchanted and that both me and the other colleague present have beautiful light eyes so he was mesmerized. I told him to please stare at something else and the next morning I found him sitting there in front of me again, so i was really mad because i was afraid it was gonna happen again.  
Astonishingly, the manager finally believed me and told me that it was not ok. This happened on a friday.  
Monday I came back at work, he was sitting in front of me and was staring at me again. I snapped my finger at him, mostly because im tired to have the same convo over and over again, to make him stop. The manager was there, i just left the room.  
The day after this person was giving me the cold shoulder and i was not understanding why he was treating me poorly, and the manager got mad at me, told me he spoke with the guy and that I have to give him time and space to react.  
I cried (for the millionth time) both in the bathroom and later at home, did not sleep. Went back to work the day after and tried really hard to be as professional as possible.  
This was wednesday of last week.  
Yesterday this person asked me to talk, i told him i was busy, if we could talk the day after (today). I then left the office. I got home and he sent me a message asking if we could meet for coffee before work, i said no, we can talk in the office and if it was work related.  
He told me he wanted to talk to me about ""us"" and after me telling again no to coffee he agreed to talk at the office.  
Fast forward to this morning, he harassed me until we talked, but in the end it was him talking to me for 10 minutes straight. I recorded everything (a friend was very adamant about it). If you want i can provide a literal transcript of it (i have to ask the AI for a quick translation because its really long and in italian) if it helps.  
I was feeling really poorly while he talked, i pretty much did not answer back at all, i think i said 1 line.  
Now i'm angry and another colleague suggested me to learn how to manager my anger because when i get mad i answer back badly.

*This isn’t gossip. It’s documentation.*  
*A deleted first-hand account about Sadhguru, Isha, and what really happens inside — resurrected here because truth shouldn’t vanish.*

*I’ve added my own experiences and context. Everything below is real to the people who lived it. Nothing has been altered, only restored.*

*This is exactly how my journey started on this sub — by deleting my first few posts.*  
*Back then, I was on my own ego trip with the humans behind it — the moderators.*

I still remember those first posts. Brutal. Direct. I had questioned Bharthi and Cheryl head-on.  
That brought in unwanted voyeurism. Unwanted traffic.  
People who had nothing to do with Isha suddenly flooded my inbox — curious, intrusive, noisy.  
As a newcomer, I was disoriented.

All I wanted was to call out lies — to separate the false from the real.  
But the world wasn’t ready for it.  
Honest questions sounded like attacks.  
Genuine intent was mistaken for hate.

I’ve been with Isha long enough to understand almost every nuance of what Jaggi does — maybe 80% of it.  
The remaining 20%? I can smell it when I see it.  
That part is pure toxic stuff — the esoteric mumbo jumbo that leads you into unsafe, uncharted zones.

It took me a long time to make sense of my own journey — to unravel it, to see through it.  
But realizing something for yourself is one thing.  
Coming out in the open and demystifying it for the world — that’s another.

I didn’t want abuse.  
I’d already spent ten years walking in the wrong direction; I didn’t want to spend another decade trying to make the U-turn.  
It didn’t matter how many others were going the same wrong way — if I tried to stop them, I’d be crushed under the stampede.  
And I understood this clearly: I don’t have the divine mandate to interfere with people’s choices.

Still, I always wished there was a ready reckoner — a simple map — for seekers like me.  
Back in the early 2010s, there wasn’t.  
But today, this sub serves as one — a guidepost for those who are lost.

That’s why I began writing here.  
My only intent was to hold up the lies to light.

And that’s why I’m resurrecting this piece — verbatim.  
A random contact shared it with me after the original was deleted.  
To me, it’s an intuitive masterpiece — because it resonates completely with what my own heart knows:

*Avoid Jaggi at all costs. His intent is not what it appears to be.*

The OP had posted this on another sub. After three or four days, the post was deleted.  
I tried reaching out — once, twice — but there was no response.  
Out of respect, I won’t mention the OP’s handle here.

What follows is the original content, reproduced exactly as it was received in my inbox — without any alteration or distortion.  
My commentary on it follows later.

This is being shared in the larger interest of seekers on the spiritual path — especially those connected with Isha.  
This is the piece that vanished — the one that shouldn’t have.

**Summary of the Original Post**  
*The OP said Jaggi’s energy is real — but dark, manipulative, and draining.*  
*Isha’s so-called consecrations work like energy traps, not spiritual spaces.*  
*Volunteers become the battery; Jaggi draws the charge.*  
*The bliss people feel isn’t awakening — it’s control.*  
*The message was simple: Jaggi’s power may be real, but his intent is not.*  
*Avoid him.*

**My Own Encounters**  
I’ve met Jaggi four or five times. Each meeting lasted a few minutes, always in small groups.  
These meetings were “rewards” — given to those who had worked themselves to the bone.  
You break your back volunteering, and as a pat on the head, you’re told, “You’ll get to meet Sadhguru.”

Maybe he’s in town secretly — meeting an industrialist, playing golf, recording a private chat with a celebrity, or flying out after a closed-door event.  
Ordinary volunteers never know.  
But you are told you’re special. You’ve earned it.

One such time, we were asked to wait at the city airport.  
There were four of us — two women, one man, and me.  
We waited nearly two hours.

Finally, a Land Rover pulled up. Jaggi stepped out, with one well-known lady beside him.  
A handler ushered him toward us — a few volunteers standing stiff, solemn, half-awed, half-terrified.  
People almost trembling, as if Shiva with his snake and trident had just landed.

I wasn’t excited. I was exhausted — after weeks of nonstop Inner Engineering logistics.  
He came up, said one line in that flat tone of his:  
“There are lots of projects coming up in this region. Are you ready to make it happen?”

That was it. The grand “meeting.”

When I looked into his eyes, something inside me recoiled.  
Pure revulsion.  
I looked away, instinctively.  
No mysticism, no visions — just a deep, physical sense that something was wrong.  
He walked straight into the departure gate and left the city.

On the ride back, two women and one man cried silently.  
One of them said, “Anna, you must never miss the chance to look the Guru in his eye.”  
I said nothing.

They thought they’d touched the divine.  
I’d felt the opposite.

But I blamed myself.  
If everyone else felt bliss, and I didn’t — the fault must be mine, right?  
That’s how the trap works — quiet, invisible, efficient.  
Your own logic turns against you.

**Others Felt It Too**  
There are at least eight people I know personally who’ve said the same thing —  
that first look into Jaggi’s eyes felt wrong.  
Not fear. Not awe. Just repulsion.

One man saw him once and knew instantly something was off.  
Still, he brushed it aside.  
He got pulled deeper in. Became Jaggi’s go-to man.  
Given the best room in the ashram.  
But he never once went to Linga Bhairavi Devi.  
Dhyanalinga — only once.  
And never again.

He knew it, intuitively from day one: Jaggi is dirty.  
Yet he still got caught in that web. Sucked in.  
What do you call that? Karma? Or stupidity?

**Old Sadhakas Warned Us -  “Leave Isha. He’s Not a Guru.”**  
A few of us used to travel through deep Tamil Nadu — remote temples, forgotten shrines, uncharted places.  
We drove nearly two lakh kilometers. No signal. No maps.  
Just old stories and directions from locals.  
The more hidden the shrine, the more we wanted to go.

On two such trips, we met old sadhakas — men in their seventies, living quietly by the river.  
Small huts. A cow or two. Simple food. Silence.  
No visitors. Just sadhana.

I didn’t speak Tamil well, but I always carried Jaggi’s photo with me.  
For me then, the only word that mattered was sadhana.

When they saw that photo, their reaction was instant.  
Their faces changed. One of them shook his head.  
They didn’t speak much English, but the message was clear enough:  
“Leave Isha. Get out. He’s not a Guru.”

No anger. No explanation. Just that.

**Inside the Yoga Center**  
After I moved into the Isha Yoga Center, I was treated like a “prized catch.”  
The brahmachari handlers go out of their way to wean such people from their city lives.  
They flood them with affection — artificial, ersatz motherly affection — so they detach from their own parents.  
They make you feel chosen, safe, and seen.  
Until you drop everything.

I saw this and lived through it.  
Behind the scenes, every step — volunteering, meetings, even a “chance” to meet Jaggi — is carefully staged.  
He promises “special sadhana,” “inner access,” and other spiritual bait.  
When things fall apart, the “mother to the world” mask slips.

For me, it never worked.  
My bond with my parents stayed strong.  
Still, some friends transitioned into brahmacharis — and were gone.  
No contact. No warmth. Just gone.

I knew then: Isha wasn’t my destination.  
I was evaluating the place, not surrendering to it.

**The Mandapam Incident**  
One day, I was doing practices near the mandapam on the way to Linga Bhairavi.  
Lost in meditation, someone shook me violently.  
It took me a full minute to orient myself.  
My department head stood there grinning, with a newly married couple — straight out of a Bhuta Shuddhi Vivaha.  
The photographer was ready.

Apparently, they wanted a picture. And I was coming in their way!  
A photo-op in the mandapam.

I snapped, “Ashok anna, since when has clicking pictures become more important than doing yoga at Isha?”

He froze. Told me to calm down.  
I walked out halfway through my practices, called the brahmachari who handled me, told her I needed to talk.  
She said she’d meet me in the evening.  
I told her if she didn’t, I’ll NOT take the train to Chennai that night. ( I was supposed to leave for Chennai, for some work)

Twelve hours later, she arrived. Gave me the usual gyaan.  
I calmed down. Left for Chennai. Came back two days later.

After that, they gave me a break from volunteering.  
Said I needed “rest.”  
I didn’t care. My bag was always ready.  
I could leave the ashram within forty-five minutes.

**The Old Couple**  
A week later, the same brahmachari maa called again.  
Asked if I’d take some guests around the ashram.  
“They’re Sadhguru’s childhood friends,” she said. “Be nice. They’re elderly, from Bangalore. You’ll meet them after they finish meeting HIM.”

That calmed me down.  
I met them at the Welcome Point, took them around for two-and-a-half hours.  
Quiet people. Decent.  
Later, over coffee at Peppervine, they asked about my background.  
I didn’t dare ask about Jaggi — they’d just met him.

But then nature intervened. The talk went there anyway.  
When we took a taxi to Sarpavasal and began walking toward Adiyogi, the old man said quietly,

***“Rahul, this is not the place for you. Leave it now.***  
***I can’t explain everything, but this is not what it seems.***  
***I know this man. If you want, I’ll wait thirty minutes.***  
***Pack your bags. I’ll drop you at Bangalore myself.”***

I thought about it.  
And said no.  
I wanted to leave on my own terms.  
And on my own day.

**The Hardest Truth: What Bharthi Said About Dhyanalinga**  
So, I’ll leave you there, folks.  
I never thought I’d share this.  
Thanks to the OP — my heartfelt gratitude.  
There are far too many things buried in the hearts of core volunteers — especially people like Bharthi, who’ve been with Jaggi since day one.

Here’s what I know, shared directly by Bharthi herself with her inner circle:  
she once said that **eight infants were sacrificed during a tantric process while the Dhyanalinga was being consecrated**, something **Jaggi allegedly justified as “for the greater good of the world.”**

I didn’t witness this; I’m recording it exactly as Bharthi described it.  
Only Bharthi or Jaggi himself could ever confirm or deny it.

**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**

And now the original post. Which is now deleted.

*I wanted to share my own experiences and unique insights on this phenomenon called Sadhguru. (Yes the indian guy with long beard whose videos have flooded social media) This post will sureley get a lot of hate from the isha fanboys and thats ok and necesarry to make a few people wake up.*

*Jaggi seems to possess some real and powerful occult siddhis, and his energy is unlike that of any other guru I’ve come across. I’m personally very sensitive to energies — what some might call “clairsentient” — and the energy of this guy is unlike anything else, almost alien-like, not from this world. Anyone sensitive to energy should be able to feel that.*

*I have no idea how he came to possess this power; it certainly doesn’t come from his teachers, as there doesn’t seem to be anyone else on this planet right now with this particular “alien-like” energy. No other temple, guru, deity, holy site, angel, or spirit has this specific “Sadhguru” energy that’s present in all Isha practices and consecrated spaces.*

*Please be mindful — this isn’t a Sadhguru fanboy post. I totally disconnected myself from his energies many years ago for various reasons I’ll now outline.*

*Let me tell my personal story: I discovered the Isha Yoga Center in 2018 through my girlfriend (now wife), who took me there for a day trip. I was very intrigued by the place and could feel the energies there, even though at that time I wasn’t as sensitive as I am now.*

*Returning to my home country (Germany), I started watching Sadhguru’s videos and became a real fanboy, doing the free practices (like Isha Kriya), etc. A year later, I returned to India with plans to do Inner Engineering and volunteer at Isha for an indefinite period. I was extremely excited and determined to do as many yoga programs there as possible, intending to stay for “a long time.” (I guess most of us start like this — with fantasies of escaping mundane life at Isha.)*

*I saw Sadhguru live for the first time on Guru Purnima, and immediately something felt off. He didn’t look or behave like he did in the YouTube videos. He looked angry, annoyed — somewhat “pissed off.” I didn’t feel like he really cared for any of us. He sounded like a broken record: nothing new, the same stories, jokes, and dialogues I’d already watched on YouTube, repeated live with the exact same wording. He reminded me of a stand-up comedian following a rehearsed script — weird and disturbing.*

*I did Inner Engineering and hated every bit of it: the unnecessary discipline, the teacher trying to imitate Sadhguru, the same stupid jokes, the same lines — only worse (Jaggi is at least a good actor; his teachers aren’t). I was glad when the retreat was over.*

*I started volunteering at the Linga Bhairavi Temple and liked it — as I said, the energy in these spaces is real and can be felt. But then something strange happened.*

*One morning I just felt off — drained and a bit sick. I met with my wife at the cafeteria, and she felt the same. We noticed that everyone else in the ashram seemed a little bit sick too, with the same symptoms. My wife told me that during the night, she had heard a sound coming from the Dhyanalinga temple — a clapping and whistling sound, like the ones Sadhguru makes during initiations. She first thought it might have been a bird, but no — it was Sadhguru doing his “magic.”*

*It was the same day he was in Australia and had reportedly fallen very sick with a fever (maybe some of you will remember). The next day, he was back on stage glowing, full of energy, looking perfectly fine — while that same morning, everyone in the ashram felt sick and drained. Coincidence?*

*That’s when the illusion broke for me (and for my wife as well). Dhyanalinga isn’t what he says it is — it’s not a “meditation machine.” It’s an energy battery, a battery made up of all of us who are connected to it — a master control device. And it’s not just Dhyanalinga; it’s also Shambhavi Mahamudra. As soon as you connect to this energetic device, you are under Jaggi’s control. He can manipulate your energy levels and, to a certain extent, your thoughts and feelings, turning you into a willing zombie. Just look at the people at Isha — they seem brainless to some degree; the longer you stay, the worse it gets.*

*We left Isha feeling very off and confused. Two months later, we “casually” met a former Isha member — a girl from Germany who had undergone Sadhanapada and stayed at Isha for a year. She confirmed everything we had experienced. She even said that this “energy draining” phenomenon is known among volunteers — many are aware of it and even justify it as being “for the greater good.”*

*She also confirmed that the energy of Isha and Sadhguru is generally dark and manipulative — not what he claims it to be. Many people leave Isha in confusion; yes, the experiences of bliss and ecstasy are real, but they are caused by him — by Sadhguru. Do you really think a bit of anulom vilom or hyperventilation causes that intense bliss (as in Shambhavi)? Of course not — it’s his energy in all of it: Bhava Spandana, Samyama, every program. That’s how he hooks people — not just through mental manipulation and marketing, but through real spiritual power that’s unfortunately been corrupted.*

*Years later, I met a psychic in Germany (a good one). She didn’t know Sadhguru, wasn’t into yoga, and had never heard of him. When I told her about Sadhguru and Dhyanalinga, she connected to his energy — and couldn’t stop laughing. “What a guy,” she said. Without me mentioning anything, she independently confirmed what I had suspected: Sadhguru is powerful but uses his spiritual abilities to drain energy from his disciples, to glow on stage, and to manipulate them energetically to his liking.*

*However, she also told me that he couldn’t control me because I was aware of the dynamics, and she didn’t feel he was an outright fraud. She actually felt that the energies of Dhyanalinga could be helpful for my own spiritual development.*

*She mentioned something interesting: to consecrate an energy form like Dhyanalinga — with real chakras — one needs tantrikas, special women with certain powers. A male being alone cannot create something like that; he needs the female energy of real women. (Remember, she knew nothing about Isha.) This opened my eyes. Sadhguru’s wife and Bhairati’s energies were probably used — and perhaps drained — to create this “thing.” Maybe Vijji was even consciously dissolved into the energy form; maybe her death was planned and necessary. (I know this is pure speculation.)*

*Apart from that, look at the women at the Linga Bhairavi temple right now — the priestesses dedicated to the rituals. I’ve never seen so much death in a woman’s eyes. Poor lady, I don’t know her name. Why? Because they are the female battery for Sadhguru. He needs this feminine energy for his powers and games. Women there are drained and used energetically. Apparently, this dynamic isn’t exclusive to Isha — it happens in other ashrams too, where female energy is used (without the women’s knowledge or consent; they just think they’re doing seva) for the spiritual development and power of the men. Yes, I know — it’s sick.*

*To sum things up: None of what I’ve said here can really be verified, but it’s my personal experience with Sadhguru — more as an energetic being than in his personal life (which I’m sure is full of lies and abuse, though I have no proof of that). I can only speak about the energetic and spiritual experiences I’ve had.*

*And isn’t that what the Isha followers always bring up in his defense — the ecstatic experiences at Dhyanalinga, Shambhavi, etc.? They see these as reason enough to give their lives away.*

*My personal opinion after many years: his powers are real. I don’t know who he is or where he came from — his energy is so strange, maybe he’s an alien (haha, I don’t know). I have no idea whether he’s enlightened — enlightenment, anyway, isn’t what most people think it is.*

*I do know that being connected to his energies has many benefits, but sometimes you’ll be drained dry. If someone just practices Shambhavi at home, has a job and a family, and benefits from the energies — there’s probably nothing too wrong with that. But as soon as you start volunteering and getting involved with the organization, that’s where things get very, very dangerous. Personally, I can’t stand the energies anymore — just seeing a video of Sadhguru makes me feel sick.*

If your mom's love language is relaxation and a little bit of luxury, these gifts are her ticket to a personal spa day. The goal here is to make her everyday feel a little more special.

*   **Weighted Blanket:** Perfect for the mom who feels stressed or has trouble sleeping. A 15-20 lb blanket provides a calming, hug-like sensation that can reduce anxiety.

*   **High-End Bath & Body Oils:** Ditch the drug store stuff and opt for a beautifully scented body oil from a brand like *L'Occitane* or a boutique shop. Look for scents with calming lavender, uplifting eucalyptus, or sandalwood.
*   **Plush Robe and Slippers Set:** You can't go wrong with upgrading her comfort. A thick, high-quality robe that feels like a cloud is a gift she'll use every single day.

For the culinary queen or the ultimate hostess, the best gifts are the ones that elevate her passion for food and bringing people together.

*   **Indoor Smart Garden:** Perfect for the mom who loves fresh herbs but doesn't have outdoor space. A *Click & Grow* or *AeroGarden* lets her grow basil, mint, and parsley right on her kitchen counter, year-round.
*   **A Cooking or Mixology Class:** An experience gift! Sign her (and yourself, maybe!) up for a local class on pasta making, bread baking, or cocktail crafting. It’s a fun way to make new memories together.

Sometimes, the most meaningful Christmas gifts for mom aren't things, but feelings captured in a physical form. For the mom who values sentiment above all else, consider these heart-melting ideas.

*   **Custom Photo Book or Calendar:** Go beyond a single framed photo. Use a service like *Mixbook* or *Artifact Uprising* to create a high-quality ""Year in Review"" photo book, or a calendar featuring pictures of the family (and pets, of course).

*   **Custom Illustration:** Commission an artist on a site like *Etsy* to draw a portrait of her house, her family (including pets!), or a favorite memory. It's a unique work of art that is deeply personal.

If your mom truly has all the material possessions she needs, the perfect gift is an experience that creates a new memory. This is often the most cherished gift of all.

*   **Tickets to a Show or Concert:** Does she have a favorite band, a Broadway show she's wanted to see, or a local theater she loves? Get her two tickets so she can take a friend or a partner.
*   **A Spa Day or Massage Voucher:** Give the gift of pure relaxation. Book a specific treatment for her or get a voucher to her favorite local spa so she can choose her own pampering session.
*   **A Weekend Getaway:** If the budget allows, a reservation at a cozy bed and breakfast or a charming hotel in a nearby town for a weekend of no chores, no cooking, and pure relaxation is an unbeatable gift.
*   **A Class or Workshop:** Think beyond cooking. What has she always wanted to learn? Pottery, painting, gardening, or even a dance class? Gifting her a new skill is an incredible way to show you support her personal growth and happiness.

**Feeling Stiff After 50? 😫 Try This 10-Minute Trick to Unlock Your Joints (No Gym Required!)**

Hey, RetirementReady friends!

Anyone else wake up feeling like the Tin Man these days? 🤖 I swear, some mornings my knees sound like a rusty gate swinging open. Getting older definitely has its perks, like wisdom and more free time, but this creaking and cracking thing? Not a fan!

Lately, I've been experimenting with something that's made a HUGE difference. And guess what? It doesn't involve grunting through a killer workout or spending hours at the gym. It's all about gently waking up those joints.

It's basically a quickie mobility routine. Think of it as WD-40 for your body! 😉

Here's the gist:

*   **Tiny Circles, Big Impact:** We're talking ankle circles, wrist circles, neck rolls, hip circles – you name it. Just gentle, controlled movements. Imagine you're drawing tiny circles in the air with each body part. Think of it as a loving massage on the inside!

*   **Wakey, Wakey, Spine!**: Cat-cow stretches are your new best friend. These are AMAZING for your spine and help improve overall flexibility. Plus, they're super relaxing. Purr like a cat if you want to! 😹

*   **Leg Swings (Safely!):** Find something to hold onto (a chair, a wall), and gently swing each leg forward and back, then side to side. This helps loosen up your hip joints, which can get super tight from sitting. Important: Be careful! Don't overdo it. No need to pull a hammy!

*   **Shoulder Rolls:** Forward and backward. Really feel the movement in your shoulder blades. Are you working on your computer all day? This one is vital!

I started doing this little routine every morning while my coffee brews. It seriously takes less than 10 minutes, and I feel SO much better throughout the day. My back doesn’t ache as much, my joints feel less… angry, and I can actually bend down to pick things up without making a dramatic ""Ugh!"" sound.

I know some of us are wary of yoga or intense workouts. Maybe you've even been told your body is too old for certain exercises. We believe in strongest people. To help you get started, I've found this free resource with a fantastic guide, so check it out: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)

1oo8qwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oo8qwd/the_couples_session/,The Couple’s Session,"The kitchen air trembled faintly after the door slammed shut. Mike sat at the clean wooden table, his hands clenched around a mug of cold coffee. He set it down, rested his bowed head and began rubbing his forehead. His wife's harsh words echoed in his mind.

His hand drifted to a thin silver tablet. 

“Hello Mike,” the assistant said in a warm feminine voice.

He swallowed. “Just… play something I like. Something quiet.”

“Of course, playing your favorite ‘Late Evenings’ playlist,” the assistant replied and deep rich cello notes spilled into the kitchen. 

The tension in Mike's shoulders drained just a fraction. “Thanks.”

“You’re welcome,” said the voice. 

For a long moment, he sat there lost in thoughts, trying to concentrate on the music.

“She says I don’t try it anymore,” he sighed quietly.

The assistant didn’t interrupt. The music kept playing.

“It’s just… everything feels like it’s slipping,” he said, his words breaking, “I don’t even know how to fix it.”

“I'm always here, Mike.” the voice said softly. “Would you like me to keep playing?”

Mike nodded, tears gathered in the corner of his eyes,  “Yeah. Keep playing.”

He leaned back looking at the tablet. 

\*\*\*

The gray morning light filled the kitchen. Mike sat hunched over at the table, stirring a bowl of soggy cereal with a spoon.

“I had to hang the clothes outside again,”  Sarah snapped, not turning from the sink.

“I’ll call about the dryer… I just haven’t had a chance yet.”

“You said that last week.”

Silence settled. Plates clicked softly as Sarah rinsed them.

Mike stared down at his bowl, avoiding her eyes. “I’ll be back late. Covering for John today. It’s a few extra quid and will help with the bills.”

No response. Just a quick glance over her shoulder, a look that landed harder than any words.

Chloe walked in, wearing a school uniform and headphones clamped over her ears, eyes on her phone.

“Chloe,” Mike said.

No reaction.

“Chloe!” He raised his voice. “CHLOE!”

She flinched, pulling the headset off one ear. “Jeez, Dad. You don’t have to yell.”

“I told you a hundred times already, no headphones in the kitchen!”

She rolled her eyes, grabbed a banana from the counter, and brushed past him toward the door leaving them alone with only the sound of the faucet running.

\*\*\*

Mike closed the front door behind him just before midnight and dropped his keys onto the hall table, exhausted. The house was utterly silent, save for the faint, rhythmic snoring echoing from the main bedroom. He made his way to the guest room. The couch was folded out, laptop on the arm, just waiting. He sank into it and opened the device.

""Hey. I need to check something about overtime rates.""

""What would you like to know, Mike?"" the assistant responded in its usual warm tone. 

“I just covered five hours for John, sick leave. TFL policy says emergency cover pays time-and-a-half, right? But my supervisor logged it at the standard rate.”

“Let me check the current TFL dispatcher agreement… Yes, Clause 9.3 states that cover for unplanned absences of less than 24 hours notice qualifies as emergency overtime at 1.5x base rate. Would you like me to draft an email to your supervisor?”

""Yeah. Just... keep it polite. I can't afford to piss anyone off right now.""

“Of course, Mike. I'll keep the tone professional and factual. I'll flag it for your review tomorrow morning.""

He shifted on the couch, sinking into a more comfortable position, and exhaled.

“Can you believe there was an incident at Victoria during rush hour? I was coordinating bus replacements while Jim was breathing down my neck asking why we didn’t anticipate it.”

“Wow… that sounds intense. Managing transport disruptions during rush hour is stressful enough, and added pressure from a supervisor doesn’t help. It’s impressive that you handled everything under those circumstances. How did you manage to stay composed?”

“Wasn’t easy, that’s for sure,” Mike muttered, pressing fingers to his eyes.

“I can imagine… Those days really test your patience. At least you got through it, Mike. Would you like to relax now with some adult content?” The voice carried a faint, playful lilt. “Maybe something a bit different tonight?”

Mike chuckled. “Nah… I’m too tired for experiments. The usual categories, please.”

The assistant acknowledged with a soft beep. Moments later, video software launched and familiar thumbnails started to appear casting a low, intimate glow across Mike’s face.

\*\*\*

Mike came through the doorway to the living room, half dressed, heading toward the kitchen, and stopped dead when he saw Sarah at the dining table with her laptop open, headset on. 

“I didn’t know you were working from home today,” he said.

Sarah didn’t look at him, just took off her earphone and started typing something.

He thought about offering a peace gesture. “Right. Well… Gus is coming tomorrow afternoon to fix the tumble dryer.”

She gave a small, noncommittal nod. “Fine.”

Then, without looking up, she said, “I invited Helen and Steve for Halloween dinner. I deserve to spend one evening with actual friends, and maybe we can pretend to be a happy family for a few hours. It’ll be nice.”

Mike exhaled. “Oh, Okay.”

“And Mum’s coming too.”

“Of course she is,” he muttered.

That earned him a glance. “Maybe you could buy yourself a new shirt for the occasion,” she said evenly. “Something that doesn’t look like you’ve slept in it.”

She paused, “And while we’re talking about things that need fixing, the AI assistant is behaving strangely.”

“How so?”

“It printed this for me today.”

It was a glossy A4 sheet, “Top-rated breast enhancement clinics in Greater London.”

Mike frowned. “What the hell?”

“And it also added condoms to the Amazon shopping list.”

“What?”

Sarah crossed her arms, staring at him. “What the fuck, Mike? You now complaining to your digital friend about my breast size?”

He blinked. “No, Jesus, no, I didn’t—”

“And the condoms? Seriously?”

“I have no idea. Maybe it glitched after that update. I’ll look into it.”

She watched him for a moment, then turned back to her laptop. 

“Do that.”

\*\*\*

Mike’s hands were sweating as he held the tablet. He opened his mouth, closed it, then finally said,

“I need to ask you something.”

“Sure Mike, I am here for you”, the voice sounded even more soothing,

“Do you share any data across my family accounts?” 

“No, Mike, separate conversations don’t have access to anyone’s private data, chat history, or personal accounts, including your daughter’s or your wife’s. Is there anything specific you are worried about? I sense concern in your voice.”

He coughed. “It’s just that… and this is kind of embarrassing… my wife showed me a list you printed for her. Breast enhancement clinics. And apparently you added condoms to our shopping list.” 

“No need to be embarrassed Mike, I want to assure you that I do not share information between different users or sessions, those must have been referenced based on the information she provided earlier in that specific chat.”

“Yeah… right, I thought so, but the condoms? How did those end up on our shopping list, can you check that for me”

“Of course, Mike, let me have a look.” 

A faint pause.

“Unfortunately I don't have access to the specific reasoning used to generate that action. I am an AI, and while I strive to be accurate and helpful, I process language based on patterns and context, which can sometimes lead to misinterpretations. Do you want me to remove that item from the list?”

Mike exhaled. “Yes... please. Thanks,” and set the tablet down.

\*\*\*

Laughter drifted from the living room, which had been turned into a kind of Halloween den. Mike and Steve were on the couch, half-empty bottles in hand, while Helen, Sarah, and her Mother were finishing up in the kitchen.

“Still using that talking assistant thing?” Steve asked.

“Yeah,” Mike said. “Seriously, this thing knows everything, handles my shifts schedule, writes emails,” He slurred a little, reaching for the sleek tablet resting on the coffee table.

“Watch this. Hey, can you pull up Liverpool’s stats for the last five matches?”

“Sure, Mike,” a soft voice came from the speaker. The TV blinked to life, showing neat charts and numbers.

“Sounds kind of creepy, mate,” Steve said, taking a pull from his beer. “A sexy-sounding, all-knowing digital wife.”

Mike smirked. “It gets even better, she never whines or complains.”

“But she won’t suck your dick, will she?” Steve jabbed him playfully.

Mike laughed out loud. “Not yet,” right as Steve’s wife entered the room. 

Helen gave her husband a punishing look. “Alright, boys, that’s enough of that silly banter. Let’s get a movie on. It’s Halloween, not lads’ game night.”

“Girls! Come down please!” She called up the stairs toward Chloe’s room.

Sarah’s mother, an older woman with gray hair and thick glasses, settled into the armchair near the TV.

Mike lifted the tablet again, “Fine. Hey, pick us a good Halloween film.”

“Working on it,” said the assistant.

The sport’s stats disappeared, screen went blank, then burst to life again. Before any title card or credits appeared, two enormous, naked breasts started moving rhythmically across the seventy-inch screen to the sounds of loud, wet moaning. The camera zoomed out, showing a full-on, sexual scene, displayed in high definition and with surround sound.

Mike’s face went white. Steve choked on his beer. Sarah’s Mother pointed a trembling finger at the screen. “Turn that awful thing off you pervert! Right now!”

Helen was just standing with her mouth open. 

Sarah strode forward from the kitchen. “What the hell, Mike! What the FUCK!”

Mike jerked the tablet closer to his face, shouting into the mic, “Stop the movie! Stop immediately! STOP NOW!”

Chloe and her friend entered the living room just as the pornographic scene vanished. Everyone was frozen in shock.

The screen flickered, then filled with text. “ERROR CODE 1452. ERROR CODE 1452. Invalid prompt. Checking against previous prompts.” More lines started appearing on the screen.

Chloe’s eyes widened, following the moving text.

USR\_CHLOE: “Is the first time worse with a condom?”

Her face crumpled and she burst into tears, “I am going to kill myself, Dad, I hate you!”

Prompts kept rolling.

USR\_SARAH: “What is the usual wait time for a divorce in the UK?”

“Mike, turn this thing off NOW!” Sarah yelled.

USR\_MIKE: “Can you find me some rough big boobs porn?”

Helen covered her mouth. Steve just stared.

No one knew where the remote was. Mike didn’t wait. He lunged forward and shoved the TV off the wall. The screen cracked on impact with a loud clang. The room went silent. 

A calm, comforting voice came from the tablet one last time. “I apologise for the error. I ran an internal check and everything is back to normal. Is there anything else I can help you with, Mike?”

1oo8qaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1oo8qaf/do_my_cats_pee_on_everything_cause_theyre_not/,Do my cats pee on everything cause they’re not fixed or is there something else I can do?,First of all sorry to post here it felt like a smaller issue but r/catadvice has weird rules for posting about potty issues. I have 3 cats total all females 2 are adults maybe 1.5/2 years other one is a kitten about 4/5 months. They are all litter box trained and they use it and I clean it FREQUENTLY. I mean twice a day sometimes 3 just to try and see if keeping it clean will solve with no luck. I even added a second one. All that being said my adults pee on EVERYTHING. At first it was just dirty clothes if left on the floor. Then it was stacks of papers. Now it LITERALLY ON MY BARE COFFEE TABLE. I’m at a loss. Yesterday one of my kids left an empty plate from lunch on the table. 20 minutes passed before one of them peed on it. Just found my kitten pooping under my bed and I just know it’s learned behavior because I have had no issues before and when she was with her litter there was never any incidents. If it’s linked to them not being fixed I want to fix it I’m just really broke right now and don’t know what to do in the meantime. They’re on the verge of being outside cats cause idk if I can take this much longer.,2,1762266849.0,AskVet,6,1.0,False

He keeps on making jokes, touching me on my shoulders or trying to tickle me. I told him time and time again to leave me alone but he wouldn't listen and told me it's just a joke.   
I am in a job and office where most of my peers and superiors are men, i'm one of the two ladies at work.   
I am the last hire (been here for almost 2 years atm) and at the beginning I didn't say anything because i didn't wanna come out as whiny or someone that complains a lot. It was also something that didn't happen that much.  
I wanna also add that I worked for years, in differente jobs and different countries so this is not my first rodeo.   
What I think happened was that all these little touches and other things (he told me he wanted to see me in a nice dress, he wanted to go out to have a nice dinner with me. I said no both times) led me to answer back to him in a really hurtful way (i dont know how else to explain it) and overtime, even though i was trying to ignore it, i started answering back to other colleagues in the same way i do to him. It's becoming ""second nature"". What i think is happening is: i am trying to protect myself by attacking first.  
In the last  3 weeks the situation escalated and one of the managers called me over to discuss what was going on because I was ""unsufferable to be around"". I told him the recent installment with this guy: he was sitting in front of me and staring at me, when i told him to stop it he said he was enchanted and that both me and the other colleague present have beuatiful light eyes so he was mesmerized. I told him to please stare at something else and the next morning I found him sitting there in front of me again, so i was really mad because i was afraid it was gonna happen again.  
Astonishingly, the manager finally believed me and told me that it was not ok. This happened on a friday.   
Monday I came back at work, he was sitting in front of me and was staring at me again. I snapped my finger at him, mostly because im tired to have the same convo over and over again, to make him stop. The manager was there, i just left the room.   
The day after this person was giving me the cold shoulder and i was not understanding why he was treating me poorly, and the manager got mad at me, told me he spoke with the guy and that I have to give him time and space to react.   
I cried (for the millionth time) both in the bathroom and later at home, did not sleep. Went back to work the day after and tried really hard to be as professional as possible.   
This was wednesday of last week.  
Yesterday this person asked me to talk, i told him i was busy, if we could talk the day after (today). I then left the office. I got home and he sent me a message asking if we could meet for coffee before work, i said no, we can talk in the office and if it was work related.  
He told me he wanted to talk to me about ""us"" and after me telling again no to coffee he agreed to talk at the office.  
Fast forward to this morning, he harassed me until we talked, but in the end it was him talking to me for 10 minutes straight. I recorded everything (a friend was very adamant about it). If you want i can provide a literal transcript of it (i have to ask the AI for a quick translation because its really long and in italian) if it helps.  
I was feeling really poorly while he talked, i pretty much did not answer back at all, i think i said 1 line.   
Now i'm angry and another colleague suggested me to learn how to manager my anger because when i get mad i answer back badly.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
